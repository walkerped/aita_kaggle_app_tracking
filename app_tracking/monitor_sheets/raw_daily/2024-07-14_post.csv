0,1e36ih5,UPDATE: AITA for asking my friend to take down her bachelorette party photos?,"I wanted to give it a couple days before I updated to let the situation cool down or hopefully resolve itself. In short, the post got taken down, the wedding is still happening, and I'm still friends with her. 

I got a bunch of dms from her fiance the other day, apologizing, saying that he'd recognized me in the photos of me without my hijab and he'd informed me that he told her to take them down. He's Christian, but from what I understand, his mother veils and he understands the rules around hijab a good bit. He felt bad and I had to reassure him that it wasn't his fault and thanked him for talking to Maya for me. He asked if this whole situation would affect our friendship, and I told him I wasn't sure in what way. 

A bit after, Maya finally messaged me one to one for the first time after the whole fiasco. She apologized and explained she didn't think it was a big deal since her other muslim friend doesn't wear the hijab and she thought I was simply being dramatic. I told her that everyone is different and what someone else chooses to do with their body and faith doesn't mean someone else will do the same. My older sister doesn't wear the hijab, Maya's seen her. It's a personal choice and no two people are going to have the same relationship with it.

I asked her why me asking her to take it down wasn't enough on it's own, since she'd done similar things for others in the past (think bra strap showing, unflattering angle, exposed scars) without hesitation. She said she wasn't thinking straight and felt like it didn't matter in the grand scheme of things. It was only when her fiance brought it up to her that she took it down. She put the other four photos up (the ones without me in them) and she realized that she was being stubborn for no reason. She asked me if there was anything she could do to make up for it and I asked her to just keep it in the past.

I'd like to clear up the notion that this the first bachelorette party or even wedding our friend group has had, since that's far from it. Added, we've had conversations regarding special occasions MANY times so even if it was the first time, this shouldn't have happened. This wedding will be the third and come by September, mine will be the fourth! Also, we've been friends for almost two decades, so cutting her off over this would be so out of proportion. I did not report the photos, and I did not abandon my faith like some of you suggested. This may not be the update some were wanting, but at least things are better now and the wedding is soon and going as planned!

I want to get a short haircut to see how it feels with a more masculine traits, and I also think it would be easier to take care of (im always having to use heat styling or it looks terrible)

My husband said he doesn't like women with short hair and asked me not to cut it. I am wondering if it would be an asshole move to just do it anyway. He has very minimal requests when it comes to my appearance so part of me feels I should just keep it long for him.

2,1e2pokl,AITA For not helping parents fix up the new house,"I just turned 21 years old. My parents and I including siblings (all really young 6-12) are moving out into a better house out of the city. They decided to buy a house that needed about 1-2 months of work. I recently got out of college and finally have some level of independence working full time and can finally enjoy my summer. After I struggled to take care of my finances throughout  my 2 year college (Trade) and had to do deliveries making $200 a week just to cover my gas, I finally graduated and was able to start working full time. There were still tons of things I needed to buy like tools and more clothes because I never bought any, and just whatever I couldn’t afford before. Immediately after I started working full time they started charging me rent which I thought was an asshole move because in my opinion I personally wouldn’t charge my kid rent, or I would at least wait. Initially they wanted to charge me 400 and then brought it out to $300. I wasn’t and still am not making much but it was fine. So I’ve been paying rent for about a year. 

Now they’re getting a house that needed 1-2 months worth of work and they’re basically upset that I haven’t been much interested in helping out and working on the house, painting and making rooms and literally redoing the whole house. I feel like since I am paying them rent even though it’s not much I shouldn’t be forced to go work on a house after I do hard work everyday and come home from work tired the last thing I want to do is go work on a house right after. I’m hungry so that rules out the weekdays pretty much. And I have a girlfriend that I see 1 day out of the weekend and some days of the week. They complain when I go to water parks instead of working at the house.. I have gone occasionally to help, and a few times I’ve driven hours to get things they want off Facebook marketplace for the house. I don’t think I should be forced to go work on this house. Of course I will help move stuff over and I have already and will when it’s time to move in. They will never get my side. My dad doesn’t pressure me to work there only my mom. AITA? Sorry for length 

Edit: Another thing is today I was supposed to help take some stuff over, I was in my room waiting for them to call me when they were going to start. Apparently it got canceled and my mother is mad at me because I didn’t ask, just waited. I told her that if I needed a friends help and I didn’t need it anymore I would tell them… not just stay quiet and have them guessing.

5,1e2p6wx,AITA for not sharing my cookies with my Dad?,"
Ik the title sounds ridiculous but let me explain:

Before I begin with the story I need to give you some context about my dad: 
I love him with all of my heart, but I gotta say that he can be incredibly exhausting. He has the habit of making a scene out of every little thing and causing arguments sometimes on purpose. He also has a habit of not accepting my boundaries, and gets really angry when I establish them.
So now to the story: 

I (19) am currently in NYC with my family for a trip. Sadly I got sick yesterday and stayed home today. My parents bought me some Chips and cookies from the store.

Like 10 minutes ago, my dad comes in and asks if he can have 1 of the cookies, and I said no because I have only a few left, but he can have some Chips or other stuff that I have in my room. 
When I tell you he got pissed, that would be an understatement. He got incredibly angry, told me how rude I always am and how I never share (which is NOT true)how egoistical I am and how he always treats me so nice and Im so ungrateful. I then, taken aback, told him that he should just accept my no but he can have the other snacks that I had.
He then said that apparently he OWNS the cookies cause he bought them, and told me again how ungrateful I am and how I have such ""evil"" personality traits, and that he will never again ask me for anything.
The whole time I stayed calm and composed, I wasnt angry or anything cause I knew if I raised my voice then this 'argument' would further escalate. Hes now moping in the other room I think and Im scared of coming out of my bedroom lol because I fear the argument will then start again.

The thing is I know that Im not in the wrong here (atleast I hope so lol) but I still have a voice in the back of my head that tells my that my dad is in the right, and I shouldve just given him the cookie. But its also so exhausting to not have my boundaries accepted and to listen to his rants on how of a bad person I am, he always does this and I noticed that definitely affected on how I think of myself. 
I feel that no matter how much I try to explain to him how that makes my feel and how stressful it is, he never betters himself. Or maybe he is right about me idk

Also sorry for any grammar or spelling errors, Im not a native speaker.

7,1e2oxeu,AITA for wanting my husband to work less?,"My husband and I have been married for 5 years. Before that we had 5 years of long distance relationship. Back then all we dreamed about was to be in the same country. And once it became reality we were very happy. We had a baby, she’s 5yo now. And I had horrible postpartum depression. For her first two years it felt like I was alone in it while he was working, he was only provider and I think it was hard on him. I found myself help, medication and thanks for my husband’s financial help, I was able to do therapy for a few years. That helped a lot with any arguments we had, I changed and changed the way I communicate with him. I completely stopped nagging him or arguing with him thankfully because I realized my perspective was wrong. 
All was okay until my husband found a job with a maniac boss who does nothing but work. And my husband admires that. So he’s been working already long hours (50-55 hrs per week) but he also stays longer whenever anything goes wrong. The other day he came home after 6am while his shift ended at 1am. We talked and he seemed to understand but today again he’s staying extra 4 hours because someone was fired. A week before he had to go in on his day off. I can never rely on him really in terms of childcare. Thankfully, I work remotely and in spans of 2-3 hours so I’m always managing on my own. But it’s very exhausting and depressing. We have no holidays, vacations and barely any time we do anything nice together. I feel lonely, tired and helpless. I love my husband so much but thought the other day that if we divorced at least I would get some days for myself because he’d be legally forced to take our daughter. 
In addition to all this, I always doubt myself if I have a reason to be mad or not. I can’t tell if I’m being selfish and need to take care of my own happiness. Or if it’s a legitimate complaint. I don’t know what to do. We lost insurance when he picked this job so counseling would probably be too expensive. And I’m not sure how it can help us. He tells me he doesn’t want to work such long hours but I see how he can never say no to his job. He always says “it’s in my job description”.

8,1e2onpb,AITA for yelling for yelling at my martial arts instructor after he talked trash about my wife?,"This is a story about and a friend of mine, who I shall refer to as “LP”. LP and I trained at the same martial arts school for several years. When our instructor retired and moved out of state, LP decided to start a club so we could keep training on a more informal basis. Since we were both black belts, I decided to join the club so that I could keep training and help LP with teaching.  
  
LP is a joker and likes to tease people, but at the same time, he is kind of sensitive about people who he feels that are being disrespectful to him. (Not a good combination, I know.). LP had teased me about stuff before, but he never seemed to get the hint when I told him to stop.  
  
The triggering event occurred when one of our students came to class and announced that his wife had just had a baby. While the rest of us were congratulating him, LP started teasing him about how he should be at home helping with the baby and that his wife was going to hold it against him for coming to class.  
  
I thought that was very disrespectful, so I told LP that not all women are like that. In fact, that evening happened to be my wife’s birthday, but she was working late so she told me to go to class and we would celebrate on another night.  
  
LP turns his attention to me and says that no matter what my wife says, she’s going to secretly hold this against me. Basically, his ex-wife had done this to him and now he was claiming that all wives were going to act just like his ex. I told him to knock it off, rather forcefully.  
  
Instead of stopping, LP launches into a tirade about how I’m not allowed to get angry at him, how dangerous it was for me to let my emotions get the better of me, and how I needed to be more respectful.

The rest of the class was mostly normal, but I was still annoyed. After class, I told LP that I didn’t appreciate that he talked trash about my wife in front of the entire class. Instead of apologizing, he doubled down on the things he had said before and added that I needed to learn better self-control and that he was going to test me until I could keep my emotions in check.

After we had cooled off for a couple of weeks, I sat down with LP to try to clear the air. He insisted that he had done nothing wrong. His defense of his actions fell into two camps:

1)      It was okay for him to tease me because he was just making a joke and that’s just the way his is.

2)      Even if I didn’t like what he was saying, I needed to be more respectful because the other students would lose respect for him otherwise.

I understand the protocol of treating the martial arts instructor with respect, but it seems to me that LP was expecting a double standard: He could be the class clown, but I had to treat him with respect.

In retrospect, we both could have handled this better and we’re both stubborn, but it’s still putting a strain on our relationship.

LP turns his attention to me and says that no matter what my wife says, she’s going to secretly hold this against me. Basically, his ex-wife had done this to him and now he was claiming that all wives were going to act just like his ex. I told him to knock it off, rather forcefully.  
  
Instead of stopping, LP launches into a tirade about how I’m not allowed to get angry at him, how dangerous it was for me to let my emotions get the better of me, and how I needed to be more respectful.

The rest of the class was mostly normal, but I was still annoyed. After class, I told LP that I didn’t appreciate that he talked trash about my wife in front of the entire class. Instead of apologizing, he doubled down on the things he had said before and added that I needed to learn better self-control and that he was going to test me until I could keep my emotions in check.

After we had cooled off for a couple of weeks, I sat down with LP to try to clear the air. He insisted that he had done nothing wrong. His defense of his actions fell into two camps:

1)      It was okay for him to tease me because he was just making a joke and that’s just the way his is.

2)      Even if I didn’t like what he was saying, I needed to be more respectful because the other students would lose respect for him otherwise.

I understand the protocol of treating the martial arts instructor with respect, but it seems to me that LP was expecting a double standard: He could be the class clown, but I had to treat him with respect.

In retrospect, we both could have handled this better and we’re both stubborn, but it’s still putting a strain on our relationship.

When it comes to gifts my daughter (Maddie 7) get things from the dollar store while my nephews get whole Lego sets, iPads and even Disney trips. If my sister needs babysitting they will drop everything for her last minute. If I need it I have to give them a two week’s heads up as well as proper payment. 

Because of this clear favoritism my daughter doesn’t have a good relationship with them. If you as her about her grandparents her mind automatically goes to my husband’s parents because she forgets that she has two pairs. 

Earlier today we having a rare meet up with my parents. My daughter asked if she can go on the trampoline outside. My dad said no because it’s for my nephews. My daughter begged but dad still said no. Maddie then stomps away and said this is why I like other grandma and grandpa more. My parents looked at me expectantly but I didn’t do anything.

We originally had plans to see a special screening of a movie he loved as a child. I recommended that we make it a double feature and see another with our down time, since he loves movies, and he was up for it. During the first film, he snored the entire film… I had to keep waking him up, which ruined the film for me and made me feel upset, I think due to dampened expectations. The next movie was right after this one… and, I admittedly out of a bit of frustration from waking him up constantly, stated that idk if we should see the next film anymore due to his snoring. (This film had special commentary from an actor.). He stormed out of the movie, threw his drink aggressively into the trash can, and walked off without me. We met back up at the car, and I stated that maybe we can go do something else but that I just didn’t want to be stuck waking him up and ruining the experience for others again. He said that he didn’t want to spend any time with me anymore, he didn’t need anyone but himself, and he didn’t want to spend time around anyone embarrassed of him. He then said the movie was boring and that’s why he was sleeping.. (the truth is he knowingly has sleep apnea that he won’t treat, he refuses). I think this is what made me upset… that my dad is obese, and won’t do things to be healthy or treat known conditions.. I have resentment as it feels like he’s already gone sometimes, when things like this happen. 

On the car ride home he said some more hurtful things to me, and explained how he felt about what I said also. I told him I was sorry, and now that he explained how he felt asked if he was still up for seeing the movie, and that I just didn’t enjoy waking him up while others stared at us. He said no, it was done, and dropped me off at home and left. I did try calling him to offer to go again, no answer. 

So, AITA for mentioning the cancellation of our movie due to his snoring? 

TL;DR: My dad and I were planning to go to 2 movies for his birthday, the 2nd being a special screening of a film he enjoys.

12,1e3gacv,AITA for asking my neighbor to stop filming the backyard?,"I live in a small historic district with an HOA. A new couple moved into the house next door a little over one year ago, at first seemed to be two very sweet men, I will refer to them as M and L, in their late 40’s perhaps.  Before they had even moved in, though, there had been a team at the house renovating, which I had found quite annoying. They also painted the home a pale purple, which is a bit of an eyesore. I asked about the color when they moved in and apparently that was period appropriate and pre-approved by the city and HOA. This was May 2023.

The first minor conflict was in June 2023 over my two dogs when M asked me to keep them out of their area of the yard. There are no fences here and my dogs, two little Shih Tzus, have always stayed within the bounds of the cut grass, there is also a wooded area farther in the back, but of course they don’t know property lines. I explained and M told me he would prefer they don’t come into “his yard.” Now everyone here has always just treated this as shared space. However, I was civil, I didn’t want to cause an issue after just a couple months, so I relented.

After this everything was fine for a while through the fall and winter. Then, in April, M told me my dogs are going in his yard. I told him I watch them while they are outside and they haven’t been in his yard. He then showed me motion camera footage of my dogs. Which, by the way, I’m not sure he is allowed to capture footage of other residents. I told him as such. He told me it’s only aimed on “his property” and that my dogs aren’t “other residents.” I told him I don’t feel comfortable with him filming like that. He said if I don’t like it then don’t go in “his yard.” I told him my husband is a former Navy officer and now works in a security sector, and he’ll tell you this isn’t legal.

Didn’t hear from him for a while. Our neighborhood goes all out for 4th of July, block party and professional fireworks display, and my husband and I saw L out at the block party but not M. He was friendly despite the conflict I’ve had with M. He thanked my husband for his service. We asked if M was alright, he said he doesn’t enjoy loud noises. I asked my husband to talk to L about the filming the yard and he seemed reluctant to do so, later told me he was upset to be “put on the spot” right in front of L because he wasn’t prepared in that moment. 

I went over this week because the camera is still there. M told me “it will be staying.” I asked he remove it because it’s a violation of privacy, he said something like, “is that a command, ma’am?” I simply said yes, not knowing how to respond.

A few years ago I had a pretty traumatic year. I lost a lot of family suddenly due to illness in the span of a couple of months and had an accident that completely destroyed my life and took away everything I had been working hard for years to get. My recovery was and continues to be the hardest thing I've ever had to do and I developed PTSD from everything that happened.

They will tell me it's too hard to talk about it with someone and they feel they weren't ready for that step yet.

At our destination, quite a lot is done via smartphone (paying, checking in for flights, getting train tickets, booking taxis, etc.). It was my first time there and the idea of running out of battery and being stranded was quite unsettling for me (yes, we were travelling in a group, but I didn't want to be left without power). My phone is also a bit older and the battery is no longer the best. So I brought a power bank and only used my phone for the essentials during the day's activities, i.e. taking photos, paying, and reading a bit about the sights that were on the agenda. So I got through the trip quite well and only occasionally plugged my phone into the power bank on the way, which was still about 60% full in the evening.

My fellow traveller, let's call her Jenny, was a bit more relaxed and used her phone to the full, took photos and videos, shared them with colleagues, face-timed home from time to time, watched videos, listened to music and surfed all kinds of social media channels. Her phone was empty by the early afternoon and she was always allowed to use a fellow traveller's power bank as she didn't bring one.

We flew back to our country very late at night and it was quite clear that it would be difficult to find a power outlet anywhere by then, as we were on the road all day. During boarding, Jenny asked me if she could have my power bank as her phone was almost empty. My power bank was still a little over half charged at this point, but I wanted to keep it as we had an 11-hour flight before us and I still had to book a train to my city after landing in our country, for which I needed a working phone. So I politely refused and told her that I unfortunately couldn't share. She accepted it without a comment, but I have now heard from a fellow traveller that she called me a stingy asshole. 
An hindsight, I probably could have spared a few % of battery, but I think that other people's poor planning is not my responsibility.

Eva got married to John(25m) in 2022 but recently he passed in a car accident involving a drunk driver leaving her pregnant and widowed.Let’s get into the part where I might be the ass-hole. Last Saturday was my gfs birthday and the day was going by pretty smooth and then Eva called me, at first I ignored it but then they kept coming in so I excused myself to answer it and it was Eva asking me to meet her at the hospital, and I left without telling anyone after she gave birth I sent my gf a long paragraph telling her what happened and why I left so suddenly but she didn’t respond so I didn’t text her anymore on Sunday I went home to shower and get some food before going back to the hospital and Cara picked a fight while I was getting dressed about how I picked Eva over her on her special day and I said that we could always celebrate a different day but right now Eva needed me more than her at the moment as she had no one else to take care of her and now I’m sitting in the hospital getting spam messages for her and her family calling me all kinda of nasty and distasteful things going as far as to saying cheated on Cara with Eva.


Edit: not an update just a few details I left out. Eva wasn’t supposed to go into labor until the middle of August which is part of the reason I left in such a hurry and didn’t bother to tell anyone.

19,1e3fffx,"AITA For Not Calling A Seat, I Was Already Sitting In?","Hello, I(14F) needed an outside perspective on an experience, that occurred back in April. So let’s get right into it ig. Back around April a band trip had been scheduled for the members of my school of which we’d be riding charter buses. I really wanted to sit in the back, just because I always sit there usually alone, but not against others. The buses began to load at 5 AM, so as soon as we were allowed to go, me and another friend we’ll call June ran to the bus with suitcase in hand so we could have our pick of the seats. We ran to pretty much the back of the bus and I took the side adjacent to June, so we could all sit together with our other friends, I’m sitting on my seat waiting for our other friends to join when all of a sudden, this guy I’ll call Jim, immediately tells me “[insert my name] you’re not seating here”. I thought he was joking because I was out breath and had literally just sat down. He then takes the seat behind me, and berates me telling me that I need to “move” and that I “don’t even talk to anyone” so i should have no trouble moving. Then comes, 2 girls we’ll call Jasmine and Jane(idk why they all are Js), Jane comes in telling me they all “planned” to sit in the back and they “called” it. Then Jasmine’s telling me and June(who has moved to sit next to me atp) that we need to move, all the while some guys who also came early to sit in the back are telling them to chill and it’s not that serious while Jim is saying that “it is”. I then tell Jasmine  that it makes no sense to “call seats”, and then she *YELLS* at me saying “YES WE CAN NOW MOVE” and then tells her friend next to her that I’m being “annoying”. We did eventually, end up moving because i was getting tired of the whining like babies, but the whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth. Apparently something similar happened on another bus with my friends who was sitting in the back as well. They just decided to stay. So i think the popular(or as popular as you can be as a band kid) kids planned to take and/or guilt trip the seats out of others. They seem to have really wanted the seats and I keep thinking that if I moved it wouldn’t have caused strain, so AITA?

•Jasmine before this incident was my “friend”(I kinda sensed we weren’t deep friends, but I talked to her a lot before) 
•I had been cool with all the people involved including Jim(not like friends, but like acquaintances)

A little background info. I am 30f and live with my husband 33m and my retired parents. We welcomed them to live with us after my father retired so they could travel and use our home as a hub for I between travel. I love my parents. They are my bestfriend’s, but I’m struggling really bad right now with this situation. My paternal grandmother passed a little over two weeks ago. My father and her were not close but she’d been a major part of my life growing up and I’ve had a really difficult time dealing with her passing. My parents are set to inherit around $140,000 from her passing. With how close I was with my grandmother, I wanted to request $10,000; approximately 7% of their inheritance to put towards my medication and to pay off some credit card debt.  She passed in incredibly poor health from not taking care of herself and I’m trying to do better for myself by starting medication but it’s incredibly expensive. My parents scoffed when I asked and gave my reasoning and I left it alone. Then one night my mom found me crying (about life in general) and told me that her and dad had talked and that they were going to give me $5,000 and write a check for me the next day. I was extremely thankful because I didn’t expect anything. Tonight after dinner, I requested the check in the morning so I could run to the bank before work. My dad looked at me and rolled his eyes and ignored the question. I looked at my mom confused and asked if she really had talked to him about it. Turns out, my father went off on a tangent last night about me requesting money and that he wasn’t given a dime in his life.

Full story:

32M/32F sister is 34

My wife and I were invited to my sisters destination wedding in Mexico this September. For us to go to the all inclusive resort for 3 days will be almost $1400.

 Due to a recent move, I have been out of work and we are on one income. My sister is supposed to be having a stateside wedding for those that will not be able to attend the Mexico wedding but we were told “coming to that wedding doesn’t excuse us from going to the wedding in Mexico”. 

We were instructed to book our travel and room arrangements with their travel agency but after we saw the cost (more than the cost stated above), we did our own bookings and research. After sharing with my sister that this was a very expensive trip she offered to give us $500 towards the total cost. 

Fast forward a few weeks and we were able to find the lowest flights and used perks to get our room at the same hotel. I informed my sister that we were officially booked and asked if she would send over the money that she had offered. She responded with “is this a gift or a loan?” I told her that the original offering was indeed a gift but that it was not our place to FORCE her to give us the money. She said that since she doesn’t work during the summer and that they bought a new house, she couldn’t help us any more. Keep in mind that  I have been out of a job for longer and also have had major expenses pop up. 

My wife decided that she won’t be going due to her job and again, the price. My sister is now trying to guilt trip me into going. 

Furthermore, the ENTIRE family has expressed how expensive this trip is and how it’s putting everyone in a hard spot. 

My sister didn’t even know how much everything was going to cost her family until I broke down the cost for her.

23,1e3egdn,WIBTA if I don’t go to my cousin’s celebration of life?,"My cousin died unexpectedly 2 weeks ago and it has shaken my family. We were close as kids and she was the only one of my 7 cousins who I was still in contact with. My family is dysfunctional and my dad does not speak to his 3 siblings (one of whom has passed away, but they were not speaking before). 

My remaining cousins and my siblings are all feeling guilty for not being close and are all suddenly very interested in connecting. I am making an effort to chat with them and form relationships even though I am introverted and actually preferred my quiet, family-less life. My close sibling lives overseas and is feeling the same way, but my estranged sibling has continued to keep their distance which is fine with me. My mother is obsessing about trying to mend the relationship with my estranged sibling.

Anyways, the funeral was private and no one was invited but instead my uncle and remaining cousin in that family have booked a celebration of life at a pub in 3 weeks. They live a long drive away, and getting there will take 6-8 hours (depending on if I go straight there or go to my parents first and travel with them). I can’t get the day off before and I have obligations the day after, so it would mean at least 12 hours travel time to get there and back with only a short visit in between.

They live a long drive away, and getting there will take 6-8 hours (depending on if I go straight there or go to my parents first and travel with them). I can’t get the day off before and I have obligations the day after, so it would mean at least 12 hours travel time to get there and back with only a short visit in between. I am considering not going but instead doing my own thing with my immediate family to recognize my cousin. WIBTA? ",0.0,0.068430095911026,0,1
24,1e3dz74,AITA for looking for an apartment with my best friends ex-girlfriend?,"A few years ago, I (24f) moved into a shared apartment in Berlin I found online. My flatmate was a guy (27m) I hand’t previously known. Initially, he seemed normal, but he had severe substance abuse and mental health issues, trashed the place, and was often irritable or unresponsive. He frequently threatened to kick me out. I felt unsafe and knew I had to find a new place quickly.

A friend, Jay (22m), mentioned his flat mate (23m) was moving out for six months. Since Jay and I were close, I asked if I could move in temporarily. He refused despite knowing my unsafe situation, because his flat mate was my ex-boyfriend. He didn't even ask him because he thought it would be too awkward. Soon after, Jay‘s on-again-off-again girlfriend, Daisy (24f), who didn’t speak German, moved to Berlin hoping to find a job and settle there. Their relationship was filled with drama, and although they were no longer together, Jay believed Daisy still had feelings for him. They met from time to time after she came to Berlin.

Daisy and I arranged to meet for coffee since we knew each other from when she and Jay were together. I told Jay, who was okay with it as long as it didn’t become a regular thing, believing Daisy was using me to get closer to him. I told him I wouldn’t avoid her just because he wanted me to, which he disliked very much.

Jay once mentioned Daisy didn’t handle break-ups well. If I'd go into more detail about what happened after a previous ex-boyfriend of her's broke up this post would get taken down. Additionally, she didn’t know too many people in Berlin. Therefore, I suggested we look for an apartment together. We found a big, affordable place and applied to sublet it, pending approval from the property owners, which is a necessary prerequisite in Germany.

I asked Daisy not to tell Jay about our search to avoid drama if the application was denied. Despite agreeing, she told Jay, then declared she wanted to live in the apartment without me. Jay called this the greatest breach of trust he had ever witnessed. This was hypocritical given that he has a record of going into his flat mate’s room, reading through his therapy journal, then going around complaining that 7-8 out of 10 things were about the living situation with Jay, disclosing that said flat mate had bought a vibrator for his girlfriend because the sex was a disaster and was forced, by his girlfriend, to return the vibrator he had bought and was willing to completely abandon me during a road trip in a foreign country after our driver (a third friend, who had a break down) ditched us and left.

I told Jay he was overreacting and that I didn’t need his permission to move in with Daisy in the first place. He was talking completely out of pocket, so I blocked him. The application was denied, making the whole ordeal unnecessary.

Am I the asshole for looking for an apartment with Daisy and then blocking Jay after the ordeal?

25,1e3dekm,AITA for telling my best friend I don’t want to hear about her shitty boyfriend anymore? ,"Hi Reddit. I am feeling really bad about this, and need advice. 

I (F23) have been friends with my BFF Kayla since we were 11. She is awesome and has supported me through some really tough times, and I have been there for her through a lot of shit too. We have never fallen out, and we always supported each other. Until now. 

Kayla has been with her boyfriend James for just over two years now. I liked him at first, he was good for her. He made her happy, so I was happy. 
But for the last year or so, every time I have seen or chatted to Kayla, all she has done is complain about him. Some of the stuff she has told me about him is super gross, and I have lost all respect for him, and in turn, I have started losing respect for her. She has also changed a lot since being with him; she used to want to travel the world, explore and experience new things. Now she never leaves her house and wants to be a stay at home mother by the time she’s 25. It makes me sad to see, she has lost her sparkle.

It all came to a head when we went for dinner for my Birthday. She spent the whole night complaining about James, as always, telling me way too much personal stuff about him, as always, and just generally moaning. It was after we had finished our meal when I finally snapped and said I don’t want to hear anymore about her shitty boyfriend, because everything I advise her to do she just ignores and I have nothing left to say to her. I told her she should dump him if she hates him so much, and if she isn’t going to dump him then to quit bitching about him all the time because I didn’t want to hear it anymore. 
I had had quite a few glasses of wine and was just feeling super bummed because she made my whole birthday dinner about her and her stupid boyfriend. 

This was 5 days ago and she hasn’t spoken to me since. I messaged her the next morning apologising and asked her if we could meet up to talk about it, but she hasn’t responded. 

So Reddit, am I the asshole?
 

EDIT: Thank you all for your comments. I can see you’re all very divided about if I’m the asshole or not, and I get why. I have accepted that I am the asshole for going nuclear when drunk, and I know I should have spoken to her in a mature and calm manner WAY earlier than I did. She shouldn’t have ruined my Birthday dinner, but she is struggling she didn’t deserve to be spoken to like that. I have decided to write her a letter apologising for the way I spoke to her. I am going to write (very nicely) that I still stand by what I said, and that I love her but hearing her complain repeatedly about the same issue without taking advice is very draining. I’m going to tell her I want to still be friends and that I don’t want this to ruin our friendship. I will also recommend she goes back to therapy (she had a therapist in high school but ghosted her). If she then reads my letter and decides to end the friendship, then that is up to her and I will be sad, but everything happens for a reason— right?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-14,"AITA for telling my best friend I don’t want to hear about her shitty boyfriend anymore?

26,1e3d8ap,WIBTA for telling my friend I’m not interested in “applying for the job”?,"I (42F) have a friend we’ll call SQ(50sM). We met many years ago when we worked together. He was always very kind to me and even gave me rides to work sometimes when it was freezing outside so I wouldn’t have to walk/catch a bus/ride my bike. I haven’t owned a vehicle in 17 years, and he took pity on me. We were always friendly with each other and got along well. I left the job and we didn’t really talk much for years, but we’d chat on socials a little here and there. Nothing more than that.

A few months ago we were chatting, and he asked if I’d like to get lunch sometime. We met for lunch and my feelings about him being a good friend and good person were cemented. 

Recently, I posted pictures of me in a new dress. I have lost a tremendous amount of weight in the past few years and I’m proud of myself, but I still struggle with self-esteem and confidence, and I mentioned that fat people are treated horribly in our culture. He texted me afterwards, saying we should go out to dinner so I could show off the dress in public and flaunt it. It just seemed like a kind suggestion. He said that he would treat, because he asked me. This was very kind of him but also handy, because yesterday morning I woke up to find my debit card stolen and my bank account drained. 

We went out to dinner last night. He picked me up and took me home afterwards, as I still have no vehicle, and we had a great time together. I wore the dress and felt comfortable. I’m an incredibly social person and I get along with just about everyone, but nothing prepared me for our goodbye. He drove me back, I invited him in to meet my cat because he is a cat person, and when we were saying goodbye he told me that I had done a great job on my “job interview”. That he wanted to date me, and that he was prepared for it to take however long it needed to. That “the dress dinner” was just a convenient opening for my “interview” aka how he could gauge his interest. I should have said something right then but I was honestly gobsmacked. 

He also loaned me some money, as I have nothing to my name right now. I will pay him back as soon as funds are restored (likely tomorrow). I feel really stupid about this, but he has never hit on me or flirted with me…just randomly announced that my “interviews” are going well for the role of his gf when we said goodbye. The role I don’t want.

So, dear redditors, WIBTA for telling him I have no interest in “applying” for the “job” he thinks I am “interviewing” for? That I never applied for it and don’t want to be considered? I’m not dense (though I’m sure it seems that I am); I can look back and see better what was happening now, but I am not in any way attracted to this man and I need to let him know, preferably in a kind way.

27,1e3d3lv,AITA for asking my friend to pay me back for breaking an expensive skincare product?,"A few days ago, I (F24) hosted a sleepover with two of my friends, both also 24. At the end of the night, while we were all taking off our makeup, I told them they could use any of the skincare products in my bathroom cabinet. I'm really into skincare and have a variety of products, ranging from drugstore to high-end.

A few moments later, one of my friends, Jane, told me she accidentally dropped and broke one of my skincare products. It was the SK II Pitera Essence, which retails for about $134 CAD. The bottle is made of glass, so it's quite fragile. It was about 80% full since I had just bought it a couple of weeks earlier.

She apologized and said she felt really bad. I told her it was fine, but when I mentioned the cost, she was shocked. I then asked if it would be possible for her to pay me back, not the full price but at least part of it. She seemed uncomfortable and said she didn't think she should have to pay since it was an accident and I had offered for her to use the products in the first place. Since then it's been awkward between us and we haven't spoken.

Our other friend who was there isn't taking sides and is staying neutral about the whole situation.

AITA for asking her to help cover the cost of the broken product?

EDIT: I wanted to thank everybody for their input. I didn't expect this story to get that much attention. I've been reading the responses you guys left, and just to clarify some things:
I didn't tell my friends about the price beforehand because it would be kinda awkward to say ""Hey, you can use my stuff but be careful, it's really expensive"". I trusted my friends to use my products responsibly. I keep all my skincare in the same cabinet regardless of cost, because I use them on a daily basis so it's just more practical. Jane is not wealthy, but she is financially stable. She admitted that she knew it was an expensive product (she's heard of the brand before) but didn't realize it was THAT expensive. This isn't a hill I wanna die on, so I'm not going to press the issue further with Jane. I texted her to let her know she doesn't have to reimburse me. Thank you again for all the perspectives.

29,1e3csjn,AITA for asking my mom to buy back an item that she sold?,"Update: My mom messaged the guy selling it and offered him less than what he posted it for. He said he has a lot of people interested in the item and wants full price. My mom says she will give me $200 for the item. This way, she can say she “bought” it from me and then decided to sell it for $30. She has since apologized, but it doesn’t feel sincere. I’m less upset about the money issue and more about the manipulation and lying.

4 years ago, my mom found an item for sale on Facebook. She sent me the listing (she lives across the country) and said I should buy it. I had an idea on how to use it and thought it was cool, so I bought it. I soon realized it was a collectible and worth quite a bit of money. I got it for $100 in almost perfect condition.

A year ago I thought about selling it since it’s worth a lot of money and I could use the cash. My mom told me I shouldn’t sell it because she liked it and wanted it. I ultimately decided to let my mom have it, but said if she changes her mind, I’d like it back. She agreed. She couldn’t pick it up for a year though, because she lived across the country.  (It’s a big item). She came to visit last month and grabbed it then.

3 weeks later I find out she sold the item at a garage sale for $30, and that she was going to keep the money.

I immediately got upset because I never told her to sell it. We were talking on the phone when she yelled at me, said I was being ridiculous, and hung up. She kept calling me throughout the day but I ignored her. Later that day, she told me some kid with down syndrome bought it with his dad and was very excited, and that I should be happy for the kid.

My dad came home from work and found out what happened. This is when my mom said that she never wanted the item and because my dad didn’t want it either, she decided to sell it. I called her out and said that she told me for years that she wanted it and that’s why I never sold it myself. She said she didn’t do anything wrong, but my dad realizes that she’s been lying to both of us and trying to manipulate me. 

While I was on the phone with my mom, my fiancé found the collectible for sale on the Facebook marketplace. Exact item, newly listed, exact same town as the garage sale, for over $100 more than he bought it for from my mom. I looked at the seller’s page and realized that this is the man’s job. He finds things at garage sales and sells them for more. There was no kid with down syndrome that bought the collectible, just some old guy. I sent my mom the listing, along with pictures of that item being sold on the internet to show her that people buy them for $300-$1,000. The higher end being items in great condition, which mine was in.

While I was on the phone with my mom, my fiancé found the collectible for sale on the Facebook marketplace. Exact item, newly listed, exact same town as the garage sale, for over $100 more than he bought it for from my mom. I looked at the seller’s page and realized that this is the man’s job. He finds things at garage sales and sells them for more. There was no kid with down syndrome that bought the collectible, just some old guy. I sent my mom the listing, along with pictures of that item being sold on the internet to show her that people buy them for $300-$1,000. The higher end being items in great condition, which mine was in.

My mom refuses to apologize and is mad at me for being upset. I told her that she should buy the item back and give it back to me. AITA? ",0.0,0.02036360278725624,0,1

32,1e3c17z,AITA for asking my parents not to include my sibling's MIL when meeting my fiancée's parents for the first time?,"My future in-laws traveled to my parents' town to meet them. It was my parents' first time meeting my future in-laws.

It will probably be the only time they get to spend time together before we get married next year.

It was very important to me that they spend what little time they had together getting to know each other deeply.

As context, my fiancée's in-laws spend most of their time in Asia. My fiancée and I are on the West Coast of the USA. My parents are on the East Coast, along with my sibling and their in-laws family – whom my parents see regularly.

The night before they were going to meet, my dad mentioned to me that my sibling's mother-in-law (SMIL) would be there at the meeting the following day.

SMIL is very talkative – to the point where my mom has complained to me about it.

After learning this, I texted my mom and dad:

> Hey guys! Honestly im kind of bummed that it won't be just you and \[fiancée's\] parents tmrw ie that \[SMIL\] will be there. Because I feel like that will meaningfully impact your ability to connect with each other. I think the time is precious and that your relationship with them is 1/1000000th the importance of their relationship with \[SMIL\].

After this, my dad called me, and I clarified my concerns:

If they all hung out together, SMIL would very likely take up all the space in the conversation, leaving little room for my parents and my future in-laws to get to know each other.

I asked my dad to ensure that they spend the duration of their time by themselves to avoid this outcome.

I sent a text message to my mom & dad again clarifying this request:

> Thanks guys! Sounds like a great plan to: 1. meet them at mom’s house, then 2. just you and \[fiancée's parents\] go for a little walk maybe on the river, or around town, and then, 3. go to lunch somewhere where you can have more undivided quality time & meaningful connection 😊 

I got text message replies back the morning of the meeting like:

> Dad: OK. We got this, all will be good, don’t worry, and we are excited.

and

> Mom: Please don’t worry.  We will make sure we give them our undivided attention.  I will make it clear to all how  this is about us meeting your future in-laws for the first time. 

And then a few hours later, they sent us a photo of everyone having a meal together -- including SMIL.

I felt upset on multiple levels:

1. Thoughtlessness around the importance of this visit and how to make it as meaningful as possible.

2. Obviously not understanding / respecting my concerns around having SMIL there for the bulk of their meeting after I voiced them, and going through with having SMIL there despite my explicit request that they not do that.

So I told them that. And it clearly made them feel sad to hear it. I don't know if I'm being unreasonable, or how a reasonable person would've reacted in my position.

33,1e3by0v,AITA for not accepting my friends’ birthday gift,"About 4 days ago, two of my friends (19 yr M and 18 yr M) gave me (21 yr M) a sex toy for my birthday. I told them I didn’t want it and that I found it disrespectful. They said it was meant as a joke, that they thought that I would laugh, that I’m overreacting, and that I should see the gift in a different light.

I can only retell events from my perspective but this is some background info that I will try to produce as unbiased as I possibly can: 

A couple of days before my birthday they call me saying that they want me to make a choice between a gift that I’ve been wanting for awhile or another “mystery gift"" they found (this one ended up being the sex toy) that they thought I would really appreciate. I chose the latter, obviously. 

Fast forward to my birthday and they forget the gift, but we still have fun and enjoy the day but we aren’t able to do the final event for my birthday due to everyone being tired, I was pretty bummed about it but they reassured me that this “mystery gift” would make up for it, that I would truly appreciate it, and that they weren't joking.

So those were the events that led up to me receiving the gift. After the gift opening, we had an argument over it. They were explaining to me that the gift should not be seen as a diss and that if they were in my shoes that they would find the gift hilarious, that different groups of friends give each other these types of joke gifts all the time, that having a gift like this would be a keepsake as a fond memory or maybe a funny conversation starter. I would respond by saying that we've never given each other gifts like this before or any joke gift for that matter so I felt that my reaction wasn't an overreaction; I also told them that I understood that if they were in my shoes they'd find it funny but that I'm not them and I don't see it that way, and that I don't want this in my room, much less my house.

The main reason that I told them that I was upset about it was that how they built up this gift to be a thougtful gift that I would appreciate, and that maybe if they hadn't done that, I would be less upset about it. They said that that was the joke and that they meant no offense. 

When I asked for an apology yesterday, they said that they were sorry that I felt this way but that they weren't sorry for giving me that gift because it was meant as a joke.

So am I the asshole?

ADDITIONAL MINOR INFO:

- I don't care if I don't receive a gift from someone for my birthday, but if I were to receive a gift, I'd hope that it's thoughful. This is something that I pointed out to them during our argument.

- The other gift that I'd been wanting for awhile, that was part of the choice they gave me in the beginning, was gifted to me by another friend on my b-day. So it's not like I was never gifted it at all.

- I saw a commenter confused on what I meant by ""birthday events"" so I'll explain: My friends and I planned out the day for my b-day. I would spend time with my family in the beginning of the day and then hang out with my friends for the latter half.

We were in a friend group with a girl named Lucy (F18) and after they became friends their relationship became flirtatious and things became ambiguous between the two. They flirted a lot, she really wanted to date him, but his was not sure about his feelings. At the same time his friend Emily (F18) confessed her feelings to Malcom and they got together. Emily is my friend we weren’t especially close but we still were friends. But although they were in a relationship Malcolm kept flirting with Lucy, his behavior was not one of someone in a relationship, and she did not care that he was in a relationship. In fact she even try to come up with a plan to ruin their relationship and was convinced he was gonna leave Emily for her. Whenever we would try to tell them their behavior was unacceptable and weird they would say they were just joking. Emily knew that Lucy liked her boyfriend and that she would try to flirt with him but she didn’t know how he acted with her. One day it all broke down and when Malcom was confronted with what he did he denied everything although there was witnesses (me & the rest of the friend group). In the end Emily forgave him for what happened, Malcom and Lucy never talked again, and he somewhat took responsibility for his actions although he didn’t tell the full truth and mostly blamed Lucy. Fast forward to today, 4 months later, Emily and Malcom are still in a relationship but Malcom’s behavior didn’t get any better. He always talks about other girls and sometimes in weird ways, he talked about breaking up with her before they go to college (in different countries) because he wanted to have other experiences, and others are convinced he still has a crush on me. Also Emily is sort of blinded by love and even though other people make her notice his behavior she doesn’t take their words for it and ignores them. The thing is that those “others” are all people who have a bad relationship with Malcom so she brushes it off as them trying to ruin their relationship because they don’t like Malcom. So in this situation I am the only one who can take action and talk to Emily because I’m friends with both of them so I don’t have any reason to ruin their relationship. But at the same time I am way closer with Malcom than Emily, but Emily is still my friend and it’s not fair to her. But Malcom is also my friend so it would be betraying him and if i talk to her I know for a fact he is not gonna speak to me anymore.

Recently, my sister has been telling me last minute (like Thursday morning) that she can't have a movie night with me because she made plans with a friend and would rather do that instead. The first few times I was okay with it because I get that she wants to hang out with them, but now it's a consistent thing anytime we make any sort of plan to do anything.

37,1e3b8xf,AITA for agreeing to carry my cousin's stuff but not my mom or sister's stuff?,"I (15F) was born disabled and have been using a manual wheelchair for the last 7 or 8 years. I get tired really easily so usually I am getting pushed around. This means that I am the one expected to hold peoples stuff without question. My immediate family all just drops their stuff in my lap and tell me to hold it. Its really annoying especially because that can mean holding multiple jackets or bags sometimes which are heavy or having clothes thrown on me if going shopping or whatever. Ive asked them to stop and that I dont want to hold their stuff but they always tell me that since theyre doing the work of pushing me everywhere I owe them that. It takes the fun out of going out so I usually just try to stay at home and not go with them if I can avoid it. 

Recently we had some extended family come to visit which doesnt happen very often maybe like two or three times I can ever remember. One of my older cousins (40?F she is my moms cousin technically but they grew up together) came and she wanted to go out and see what our town had to offer. There's not much but there is a bike trail that is kind of nice and my cousin offered to push me because she doesn't get to spend as much time with me as she does with others. But she asked me to hold her bag and her water and I said okay. My mom was annoyed though and was like ""why do you complain when you hold our stuff but not hers"" and I just told her it was because she asked nicely.

Then my sister (17F) decides to ask me if I would hold her things too, and my mom immediately after and I told them both no.

I (15F) was born disabled and have been using a manual wheelchair for the last 7 or 8 years. I get tired really easily so usually I am getting pushed around. This means that I am the one expected to hold peoples stuff without question. My immediate family all just drops their stuff in my lap and tell me to hold it. Its really annoying especially because that can mean holding multiple jackets or bags sometimes which are heavy or having clothes thrown on me if going shopping or whatever. Ive asked them to stop and that I dont want to hold their stuff but they always tell me that since theyre doing the work of pushing me everywhere I owe them that. It takes the fun out of going out so I usually just try to stay at home and not go with them if I can avoid it. 

Recently we had some extended family come to visit which doesnt happen very often maybe like two or three times I can ever remember. One of my older cousins (40?F she is my moms cousin technically but they grew up together) came and she wanted to go out and see what our town had to offer. There's not much but there is a bike trail that is kind of nice and my cousin offered to push me because she doesn't get to spend as much time with me as she does with others. But she asked me to hold her bag and her water and I said okay. My mom was annoyed though and was like ""why do you complain when you hold our stuff but not hers"" and I just told her it was because she asked nicely.

Then my sister (17F) decides to ask me if I would hold her things too, and my mom immediately after and I told them both no. Neither of them were pushing me and also my mom was just complaining about me so why would I? Its not like either of them cared in the past when I asked them to not just throw things on me either.

38,1e3b8cn,AITA for cursing out my dad?,"My mom and dad were married for twenty years. They had me and my brother, who isn't even in 5th grade.

Their relationship has been strained for years. My dad was abusive - lying, cheating, and constantly threatening divorce when he didn't get his way. Multiple times a year. He broke my mom down mentally. I had to take care of her and my brother when she got sick myself, cleaning, cooking, helping with school, etc. My little brother resented for it strongly.

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, I graduate. Valedictorian of my class. The family was planning a mini-vacation to Louisiana. My mom and dad seemed to be patching things up - he went as far as saying that he wanted to be with her forever.
And then, a day after he told her that and a couple days after I graduate, he disappears while my mom in is in the shower. Doesn't even say goodbye to my little brother. Calls me down maybe 30 seconds before he leaves to say goodbye and asks me to open the door for him. He walked out suitcase in can. He told me and my mom the details via text.
We have begged him over and over to come home. Asked him to pitch in money so we wouldn't end up on the street. Cried and yelled at him. He would respond with either ""I'm sorry ya'll feel that way"", ""it saddens me to hear how that makes ya'll feel"", etc. He didn't even acknowledge what he did or even apologize. He promised he'd send money every two weeks, but the little he did send wasn't even enough to cover the rent - and almost half of the amount he promised. For reference, he makes over 70k+ a year. My mom cannot even afford her heart medication, and can't work.

 He told us that he left because he didn't feel apart of the family and often excluded him from things. That we didn't make him feel loved enough - and that is somewhat true. We would always make sure to keep our distance emotionally, and certain things we would not tell him. Me and mom and my brother have been planning on leaving him for sometime now, as soon as we could gain financial independence. I have admitted to hating him several times in private - and one of his biggest issues, admittedly, was us talking about him behind his back. I'm not sure how much I contributed, but I know I didn't help

I have been doing everything I can to bring in money - applying for jobs, trying to do video editing online for clients. We don't know if we'll have enough to eat or even continue staying in this house. He gave us no warning at all - one minute everything is fine and happy, the next we're begging him to give us enough money not to be in the fucking street. I've been grinding all day and night and barely sleeping. And I've cursed him out repeatedly - despite him saying that being yelled at is what drove him away to begin with. Now he's barely sending half the money he promised. I think I made our situation exponentially worse. I feel like I just ruined me and my family's chances of ever being stable again.

40,1e3b8a7,AITA for telling my it's weird they expect me to be invested in stuff that happened when I was a literal infant?,"I (19f) was a very big surprise and late arrival to my family. My dad had five kids before me, mom had four. Dad's oldest was from his first marriage. He was divorced and married my mom when his ex wife died. Their daughter was 5, I think. There was a big fight between my parents and his ex's family because they didn't acknowledge my mom as a family member of his oldest. They were very clear mom wasn't ever going to be my half sister's mom. My parents hated that and attempted to sever contact but I guess her grandparents took them to court and they got to see her a few times a year, though I think it was just her and not the rest of the family.

My parents had my four older siblings together and they remember our half sister well. I was born when my half sister was 17. And when she turned 18 she moved out and chose to live with someone in her maternal family. Apparently there was an incident where her grandparents and some of her mom's siblings gloated that my parents failed to make her a part of our family. And said my mom never deserved to be a part of raising her. And my siblings and I would never be her family. My dad said they actually said my siblings and I shouldn't exist. I don't know though. I think he said that to make the whole thing worse because he sometimes ""forgets"" that detail.

But there was a choice given to his daughter, us or them. She chose them.

I don't remember her. Never really ""met"" her unless you count 5 month old me.

My siblings all remember her. My family always expected her to come back to us. My siblings reached out to her over the years and got rejected. My dad found out he was a grandfather and cried when he realized he'd never meet her kids.

They have always told me about her, about the situation, they vent and bring it up a lot. I always let them. But for about 3 years now they have tried to bring me into the conversation and I have nothing to say. This woman is a stranger to me and it doesn't sound like that will ever change. I'm okay with that.

Yesterday my family and I were having a birthday lunch for one of my siblings, the topic of dad's daughter and her family came up. I was teased for never saying anything. Then asked why I never seem to care. I told them it's weird that they expect me to be invested in stuff that happened when I was a literal infant. My family told me that it was an unfair take and I should be kinder when I know they're hurting and missing her.

41,1e3av6p,AITA for not inviting my sons brother to Disneyland? ,"I (28F) never had much growing up. We were super poor and I never got to go on a holiday or anything. My sister is 10 years older than me and I remember her promising that when she turned 18 she’d take me to Disneyland (ofc this never happened lol). I decided when I was pregnant I want to take my son (7M, I’ll call him F in this) to Disneyland as it’s always been a dream of mine. We’re not rich by any means, I’m a single parent on minimum wage, but since I was pregnant I’ve been saving a little each month. Me and my sons father (39M) broke up whilst I was pregnant still, we had only been together 3 months when I got pregnant, so it didn’t work out. 

Now his dad can be a bit wishy washy. He doesn’t see our son often, I have to call him to arrange visits, and he pays barely anything in child support. He has another son (13M), I’ll call him L. When me and his dad were living together we got along fine, I was never able to parent him or anything but we were buddies. When my son was born my ex and L used to visit once a week and when he’d come over I’d make him dinner, play games with him so his dad could spend time with F. Eventually my ex wouldn’t show up for weeks at a time and L stopped coming around. Now, my ex is super into outdoorsy stuff, something I cannot do cus I have a disability, so he goes on these camping trips, mounting climbing, cool stuff to little boys. He’s been taking L on these trips since before F was born, since F was born, they continued their trips, but have only invited F once. F has never spent a night at his fathers house, my ex just simply refuses. L has his own bedroom at my exs and stays 3 nights a week. So I didn’t think it’d be an issue that I didn’t invite L to Disneyland with me and my son. I care for the kid but I don’t have any real bond with him. 

So I’ve finally saved up and we’re going to Disneyland in October. My son told his brother and I got a call from my ex calling me a heartless bitch cus I didn’t invite his son. I’m starting to feel kinda bad. So, AITA? 

Update: my good friend used to be in my exs friendship group, I told her what happened and she said that my ex had been talking about me. So apparently none of this has anything to do with me not inviting L. It was apparently because he thought my boyfriend was coming. My boyfriend is not coming with us, just me and F. My ex has never once mentioned issue with me having a boyfriend but I’ve just heard from my friend he’s extremely extremely bitter and has been talking about this for a while. He’s been telling people that my boyfriend “will eventually leave me, it won’t be long until he does”, “he’s using me”, worst of all he’s said “why does he get to spend more time with my son than me?”. That’s really riled me up because it’s entirely his fault why my bf sees my son more than he does. We’ve been together almost 2 years, he didn’t meet my son until a year into the relationship and he doesn’t live with us. We’ve talked about moving in more recently as we’re ready to go to the next step and believe my son is old enough for it. Apparently this doesn’t sit well with my ex and got mad because he thought it should be a family holiday and my bf isn’t family ? 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️ thank you all for the answers and advice, it’s so greatly appreciated, thank you!!!

42,1e3aovx,AITA for ditching my best friend on a girls trip and spending it with a stranger to salvage my trip.,"
I (25f) went on a girls trip to a small mountain town with my best friend of over 10 years and her 3 work friends. I quickly realized I was being judged for smoking and wanting to have a couple of beers at lunch. I was the only one who smoked or drank and didn't care to capture and record every minute of the trip. They only discussed taking pictures for the gram. My best friend has always been against my smoking, and this was the first time I smoked in her presence. Its a filthy habit ik and trying to quit.
I was also the only atheist, and the trip included many religious sites. Initially, I accompanied them to these sites, quietly sitting and enjoying nature while they took pictures. But after being eye-rolled and talked to passive-aggressively for smoking (always far away from them), I decided to stop going to the religious sites and waited outside. 
The others were very stingy with money, making things uncomfortable, like ordering only three appetizers for five people and waiting for buses instead of taking cabs.(Cabs were cheaper than a McDonald's happy meal) By the end of the 2nd day, I was not feeling the best. We left a cafe, and I spotted someone I went out on one date with a few months ago. We hit it off well but lived two hours apart so didn't pursue. I texted him, and he was excited to meet again. My friends decided to sleep in early, so I asked my best friend if it was okay for me to see him. She said sure, so I went out and had a wonderful time catching up with this guy. He invited me to a party at his hostel, and I informed my friend I would be back later. 
I ended up partying all night and crashed at his place for a couple of hours. I returned to my hotel before 7 am, but my best friend ignored me and walked out of our room. Seeing her reaction, I decided to ditch the planned activities and informed her I'd see her at dinner.
I tried to reason with her and make good but she was in no mood. She wanted me to follow everything she had planned which I had zero interest in whilst she would be completely passive aggressive with me.
I spent the rest of the trip with this guy, who extended his stay to hang out with me. I paid for all my expenses and didn't completely ditch my friends.

That's everything he's said to me, when I was trying to explain that I think he's wrong to complain.

Just for background, he has autism, and ADHD, and has explained to me that he doesn't always understand that he said something wrong, until I tell him it was wrong. Even after I say its wrong, he still doesn't understand, and just apologizes because he should. 


I just didn't appreciate that he complained about ""eating the same food"" when his daughter is in the hospital. He did say""I'm sorry"" but won't explain why he's sorry. 

He literally just had to acknowledge that it was wrong, and say something along the lines of ""yes, you're right, Laura is in the hospital, and there's food here"" just try to be more understanding during a difficult time
That's literally all he had to say. 

 instead, he argues, and calls me manipulative. How can he be so eager to say all these bad things, but can't offer a heartfelt apology, explaining why he's sorry.

46,1e39wgs,AITA for embarrassing my parents in family therapy?,"I'm (15m) in family therapy with my parents and my sisters Alisha (13f) and Kayleigh (12f). Therapy is pretty new and not going so well. We're not a close family, we have a lot of issues and I know we have extra stresses because Alisha has a lot of complex medical issues and she can't do everything Kayleigh and I can. She needs a wheelchair sometimes, she's on lots of meds, but she can be fine sometimes too and can enjoy life. But she has limitations we don't. And my parents make me feel like they want me to be another adult and not one of their kids.

They don't like me spending time with friends. They say I could be home, helping, taking care of my sisters or doing stuff at home for them. When I do go they can make me take one or both sisters. Get angry if Alisha can't join. If I'm forced to take one of my sisters, or both, I can't have fun. I get stuck making sure they're okay. Even birthday parties (like at places and not kid parties anymore) I can be forced to bring them when they're not invited and I get to watch them have fun. If I have fun at something and my sisters don't, then I get in trouble. Happened during our last field trips. I had a great time, Alisha had to leave early because she was sick, Kayleigh had such a bad time. I told grandpa I had a great time and my parents berated me for it. While Kayleigh got to talk about how fun my best friends birthday at the trampoline park was. And she didn't get into trouble for Alisha being jealous and missing out like I would. I got berated for not having fun though. For acting spoiled that I didn't have a good time.

They get mad I don't buy my sisters birthday and Christmas gifts. They get mad that I get gifts from my best friends parents. They get mad that I get invited to my best friends family events as a friend for him to hang out with and it's made clear my sisters aren't invited even if it's something they ""could be included in"". My parents get annoyed when I confide in grandpa. But they also get annoyed if I tell them how they make me feel. Alisha hates being left out which I get. But I'm the only one my parents get angry with for it.

Now we're in family therapy. My parents are using it to talk about how awful I am. They say I'm making life harder for everyone. They didn't expect me to say how things really are. But I did. After my parents said I act like a 5 year old who doesn't like being the center of attention I brought up in therapy how they treat me and how I feel like they take their frustration about Alisha requiring so much care out on me, how I'm held to a higher standard and they want me to be an adult and not a kid. I said they can't stand me having fun without my sisters or seeing me being the only one having fun, but almost like it when I'm the one not having fun. My parents got so pissed at me after the session and accused me of embarrassing them. I told them they just didn't want me to speak so openly in front of my sisters which is why they include them.

So my mom, dad, and I live in the United States. My mom is not from the US and my dad is. My mom and I decided to apply for dual citizenship and here’s where things get a little messy.

My mom is from a country in Southeast Asia and my dad is American, but I was not born in Southeast Asia or the United States, I was born in the Middle East. Because of this I was denied dual citizenship but my mom wasn’t. I decided to sit there and wait until my mom finished getting through paperwork. The place started getting packed as people sat down to take the oath of allegiance and, since I know I can’t take the oath, I walked out of the room to provide more space for the people taking the oath.

During the oath, my mom FaceTime’d me and I answered wondering what she needed. I heard them taking the oath and said nothing, and she hung up after a few seconds. I then got a text later asking why I wasn’t in there and I explained to her that since I can’t take the oath, I shouldn’t take up space in the room where a lot of people are going to take the oath. She is upset with me because I wasn’t in there to take photos of her taking the oath.

I will admit, I might be the asshole for that, but I wasn’t even under the impression that she wanted photos, she never told me. It was also getting crowded in there and I was taking up space.

48,1e396yh,AITA for having my wedding on a day my friend can’t take off from work?,"My fiancé and I are throwing together a small wedding in our backyard that is set for six weeks from now. We’ve been engaged for over a year now and have a daughter so we figured it’s time! We’re not into the whole “production” that some bigger weddings can become so we’re trying to keep things extremely casual. 

As a result we’ve been texting and calling people to invite them in lieu of the more traditional paper invites. I texted a friend of mine with the date and time telling her that we would love to have her attend our little gathering if she could make it and her reply really sent me for a loop. She responded very upset that the wedding was so close and that she didn’t have time to prepare for it. On top of that, I scheduled the wedding on a day that she works at the county fair. She then went on to say that my decision was rushed and I should be giving my guests as much time as possible to get ready for the wedding. 

I didn’t want to make her feel bad about not being able to make it so I told her I understood it was a busy time for her and not to worry. She then replied saying I was being dismissive and questioning if we were truly friends because I didn’t think to check the fair dates before setting the date for my wedding. She went on about how she wanted to be involved in the planning and that it felt like a “slap in the face” that she wasn’t being involved. I responded by apologizing that I hadn’t checked the dates because I thought that I knew them and then questioned why she couldn’t take the day off if it was so important to her that she be there. Apparently she’d be fired if she did because she’s the only cook available for the whole week of the fair. Six weeks isn’t enough time to find someone to cover one shift. Okay, fair enough. 

She responds to my apology by saying that it’s not a little mistake and that I should’ve asked her when she’d be available. She also asked why she hadn’t been notified sooner. I’ve tried to tell her that it’s just a small, casual affair and that my fiancé and I are the only ones involved in the planning.

49,1e393xu,"AITA for cancelling plans with a friend saying it was too hot out, when really it was also because of the company","There’s a group of friends I hang out with every week, and let’s say a bunch of people, Alex, and Jack and Jill who are dating. We usually go out once a week for something this summer, since Jack and I have internships before classes start in the fall, while Jill and Alex have the summer off. 

Now I am super close with Jack being in the same classes, while Alex is a really good person to talk to, we vibe on many levels, and he is a neighbor. 

Now this group used to do a lot more together the first 2 months, but people other than the ones I mentioned started to say no sometimes which is normal people get tired of doing the same things. It was usually Jack and Alex initiating plans and whoever would like to join joins, and I usually do, unless it’s to play basketball since I’m not a big sports guy. 
This one time Alex asked me to go with another group to watch a game, and I decided to go even though I didn’t know anything, to get out of my shell more. It was okay I guess, I had asked Jack and he joined too. 
Now Alex left for home after the first 2 months of summer, and the group has barely hung out for activities since. Jack would ask and there was a 50/50 chance I was in, because most times it was just Jack and Jill who were in, and so it would just be me and the two of them, in which case I would say no, making the excuse that there weren’t enough people and we should do something later with everyone. 
This Friday Jack said we could go out to watch another bb match at a bar, and I said sure, but he said it would just be me and Jack and Jill unless I knew someone else who wanted to go. Sunday 2 hours before the match, I have spent 3 hours cooking for the week, it was hot outside and I was reconsidering spending the last few hours of the weekend on going out and watching the match. 
Letting Jack know this got him a little down, and I had to say it was the weather and I was feeling lazy. What shocked me at the end was he said “if Alex was coming, I bet you’d come right?”. I just acted surprised and told him not to make this a thing and that was pretty much the end of the convo. 
Truth is I would have gone. But I would have gone if there were anyone else as well. I just didn’t want to go with the 3 of us. But Jack was mad and him saying that made me mad. 

TLDR: I canceled plans last moment with a friend Jack because it was going to be just him, his partner and me. However, he got mad and accused that I was only not going because a mutual friend Alex wasn’t going to be there.

""didn't plan for it"" and stating her mental health as reason for why she needs to keep her bedroom. Her therapist said her initial agreement was people pleasing, and R has stated that her bedroom is her
""own little world"". R said if she wasn't my best friend, I wouldn't even be asking this of her. I said if she wasn't my best friend, I would be letting her know i'm moving out at end of lease. She is a hard no on moving but has offered to pay all utilities in exchange for the space. She has not been willing to compromise on anything else so i gave her options: me moving out at end of lease, us going back to the plan of switching bedrooms but in december instead of september, or us signing a shorter lease next year to give us time to find somewhere that is right for all of us. I will answer questions in the comments but i'm looking for honest perspectives and genuinely need to know if i am being unreasonable.

Back in april i bought my little sister a 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee. She brought it up to me to put some speakers in it, I did the work, then the headgasket blew. So i ended up spending over 2k fixing whatever broke on it. I serviced the transmission, replaced the head gasket, and all concurrent gaskets to go with it. I ended up having to pay for speakers for the car, and a new radio. All the work that was done to it, was by me. All the parts bought, were by me. So here comes the last week. She decided she didnt want it anymore, so she went looking to trade it. We had an agreement, that if she got rid of it, it came to me directly, simply because I purchased it, and did over $2000 worth of work to it, for virtually no charge to her. When i did ask, one of my parents asked me why I wanted it, knowing the agreement we had, and why I needed a second car. But, she decided to go against the agreement, and she got another car. Now this is where I may be TA. I told her that because she broke the agreement, the new agreement will be that if she got rid of that new car, it came to me. My parents weighed in and told me that's not the case, and its not my place to ask for it.

Back in March, J was absolutely horrible when he met A. A and I were partners for our school's science fair. It was so bad that A didn't talk to me for a whole week because he was disturbed by J's behavior. 
Today is the day of the movie, A, M, and myself are going together (My parents are strict and didn't want me going alone to the movies with a boy) J had previously refused to go because it was with A but today, J said that he wants to buy a ticket.
I asked him if he was serious and he said yes. I asked him if he would be rude to A like he was at the science fair and he blew up calling me an AH. He said that he's not like that anymore, but J has a serious brain injury and is very bad at holding his tongue. Now he's mad at me. So AITA for asking if my brother will be rude to my friend?

54,1e37mqb,AITA for telling my parents how I felt about their gift?,"I (16 F) recently turned 16. When I was 13, I got my first phone, which cost $100. I had this phone for about a year and a half before I broke it a few days before I started high school. Since it was so close to the first day of school, my mom gave me three options: Wait a few weeks for it to get fixed, wait for an upgrade that I wanted, or get a new phone immediately no matter what model. I choose the latter one, and the only thing that was available at the store we went to cost $300. My mom was hesitant at first, but since I was starting high school, she told me she would buy it, but I might get upgraded later on in high school.   


Fast forward to my birthday and I haven’t had the phone for more than a year. My parents handed me a gift, which they said was the most expensive one they had bought me. When I opened it, it was a brand new phone, even more expensive than the one I had at the moment. My reaction was a mix of happiness and “Why?”. Something significant to add here is that we’ve been having a bit of financial trouble recently, and when my birthday started coming up, I told my parents that I wished to keep the $300 phone since it was still technically brand new and that getting a new phone seemed like a waste of money. My parents noticed my reaction but didn’t say anything, and we kept going with the party. 

After it was over, they asked me if something was wrong with the gift. I told them that nothing was really wrong with the gift and that I appreciated it, but it just seemed like a waste of money especially due to the situation we were in at the moment. My dad got mad and said I was being ungrateful, and my mom agreed.

55,1e37lgj,AITA for telling someone that they won't see my kids anymore because they're annoying me?,"Back in 2020, my ex wife passed away after a short illness. She had been married to ""Peter"" for a couple of years. Peter asked if he could still spend time with the boys. I said sure. He doesn't have any family and I get free childcare and the boys have another adult in their lives.

Lately I feel like he's been crossing boundaries and it's been annoying me to the point where I don't want anything to do with him. For example, my 7yo Matthew and him will go on weekend fishing trips. Matthew comes home reeking of something strong. It's so strong that I would believe you if you said it was cigarettes. I asked Peter if he started to smoke and explained why. He said no but he uses Old Spice body wash when he gives Matthew a bath. I told him to use the one I sent and he said fine. But my kid still comes home smelling like an 11yo boy after gym.

On Wednesday, Peter took Matthew to the park and both came back with buzz cuts. I had intended to take Matthew for his haircut this weekend so that annoyed me. Then he had the nerve to complain about gas money.

With my 9yo Austin, bought him deodorant. Maybe Austin needed it but that's something I take care of. Now he sends food that he doesn't want with Austin back to our place. Weird stuff like tea, frozen veggies, etc.

I told Peter that he's been stressing me out and he needs to start running things by me. I would had said no to a lot of the things he's doing or has done. He said he was insulted because he's doing these things for free. I said yes but you wanted to spend time with them. I'm flexible and sensitive to that and you have to comply orb you can't see them.

EDIT FOR CLARITY: She was never told to close off access to the doggy door. The door is left open 24/7, has been for the entirety of the dog’s life. My mom has the same 24/7 set up at her house for the dog. 

I left her my house overnight because she’s been traveling for a few weeks and needed a chill night alone. Of course I scrubbed my house to the baseboards before she got here. 

Before coming back to the house I gave her a 15 minute warning that we were coming over, and called her 30 minutes before we came over. She never replied.

I walk into my house at 8:30am this morning and smell something foul.

I go into the kitchen to see 4 huge piles of liquid shit, and immediately start puking. I walk toward the doggy door and see it’s been closed. As I’m walking through all of this puking my guts out, I see her crafting project all over the kitchen - perfectly done.

THEN I go upstairs to find my bathroom with my plants in the sinks and soil everywhere. 

I screamed at her to get the fuck out of my house. 

This is ALL after she told me off yesterday for planning to pick her up, but her plans changed and she never communicated that to me.

57,1e37ap4,AITA in this situation or am I just being paranoid...over a shirt?,"First off, I (24M) think a bit of backstory is needed before I explain the situation. I'm an American living in the U.K,and have been since moving here two years ago. I was born and raised in Louisiana and grew up loving and rooting for the New Orleans Saints. I'm a proud fan and do have some clothes that support it. By some, I mean like 2 t-shirts, a jersey and a hoodie. I try my best not to be obnoxious... 

However, recently, I was wearing one of my Saints tees while at a gym. I was behind on laundry and it was the first shirt I grabbed that was clean. (I have since gotten caught up on said laundry to prevent future situations like the one I'm about to mention...)

 Anywho, I'm at the gym, working out, minding my own business as I listen to true crime podcasts with my earbuds in. Emphasis on minding my own business, because I'm an introvert and the type who likes to just get in/get out/go home. I already have a girlfriend, so I have no need to be there longer than need be trying to get someone's number/attention. Also, after finishing up a workout, I like to sit down off to side, out of everybody's way, to rest a bit, before I get cleaned up and go home. But while doing so this time...I caught some girl's attention. 

I did try my best to be polite in rejecting her advances, saying I already girlfriend, but girly was persistent...up until she saw my shirt. Mind you, I've had this shirt for years, so it's well worn in with the logo faded some. So from afar, you wouldn't really tell it's a New Orleans Saints tee. Just a shirt with some logo on it. 

This girl's face turned like she just drank spoiled milk. Like so spoiled, it had separated in its container...but I digress. 

""Oh...nevermind. I didnt know you were American. Let alone, that type."" 

She then proceeded to suggest I get rid of my shirt, since I'm not in the U.S. and keeping it would just make me come off as a stereotypical American. 

""And no one's ever gonna find that attractive...""

Okay random chick who just walked up to me unprovoked and wouldn't leave me alone when I said I wasn't interested PRIOR to you looking at my shirt. 

Nothing happened afterwards. I got cleaned up and went home without any incidents. I told my girlfriend everything as well, who told me if I like having my shirt, then I should keep it.

58,1e378to,AITA for skipping one guy at the Costco gas line when he wouldn't pull around a guy and into the open gas pump?,"I pull up for gas at a standard 2 pump Costco gas line. The two pumps were being used and there was one car waiting for both of them. As I pull up behind the car waiting, the car at the pump further up pulls away. The car immediately in front of our two waiting cars is still pumping gas. I wait maybe 5 seconds to see if the guy in front of me will pull around the first pump and back into the open pump. He didn't and showed zero signs of doing so. So instead of honking, I pull around him and the first pump and backed into the open pump. 

The guy immediately gets out of his car and storms up to me and starts arguing and saying I cut the line. I explained to him the spot was open and he wasn't pulling into it. He dismissed it and accused me of jumping him and the two new cars in line. I only jumped him after he made no attempt at pulling around to take the open pump, so clearly he wasn't paying attention to his mirrors. This kept going and he's saying that he was waiting for the guy in front of him so we can both pull up. Which leads to me ask why he's pissed off if he was waiting for the exact same amount of time? Then he says something about how I must think I'm the most important person in the world. 

He complained to the attendant and I asked the attendant if I should give him the spot. The guy was just like ""this is above my pay grade"". During this argument, the guy between us was still there, so it wasn't like he finished and left immediately after I pulled around. While my guy was finally getting gas, he was bitching about etiquette and asking the attendant if I can get a lifetime ban for this. I just laughed it off. 

My thought is that you should always take an open pump to keep the line moving. Costco has an extra lane in the middle for you to pull around cars. I gave him the time to react and make the move and he didn't. So I did. Could I have given him more time, probably. So that would be on me if he intended to make the move I did. But from him arguing with me, it sounded like he wanted to wait and have me wait as well with an open pump right there. 

My opinion is that if there is a empty pump, it's your responsibility to take it and if you don't (for whatever reason) then the next person in line should be able to take it.

We were around my parents most of the time and they get so irritated because they are normally stressed out in life and just say stop but their reactions aren't severe enough to him or recohnising the turmoil his comments cause me.

He made comments about me not going to study at uni or not having a job (this is not intentional and I'm currently seeing a therapist for my anxiety). 

My parents applauded me for organising this trip. But they got very annoyed for me loudly shouting at my brother in public (I don't really cared who was watching as I was At breaking point from his comments.I couldn't help but feel the character in a movie who's always bullied or something and then no one sees how my brother is evil,( because he doesn't let my comments get to him and does it to me when parents aren't around).

She didn't like thst and screamed, ""Do not talk to your grandma like that."" I began crying and said, ""Don't talk to me like that then."" And left before she could say anything. I usually do this if I begin crying. I remove myself from the situation so no one makes fun of me for crying.

Well, my family came and found me outside and eventually got me to come back in. By then I was slightly calmed...until my mom said I should apologize. I said I didn't want to because she was being horrible to me. I didn't want to be a doormat, especially since I've seen how my grandma treats my mom (her daughter). And grandma definitely talks behind her back to us to make us turn against my mom sometimes. I found out later that my grandma blamed the way my mom raised me for how I turned out now. I later apologized to my cousin for causing drama (though he himself blamed my grandma partially and said it was fine). However, I'm having second guesses.

Another month and was talking to my niece, the mother of my great niece and she was talking about the things they did for her birthday. She mentioned how everyone got her so many gifts. I casually asked if she got my card and gift. She said she didn't keep track who gave her what. I then said I didn't get a thank you or notified if she did like she did when younger. I asked her if she could find out because I hoped it didn't get lost in the mail or something. She said it was rude to ask nowadays if someone received a gift or even liked it and no one does thank you notes anymore. I understand it may take time like for couples who get many for weddings but was I really rude a couple months after a birthday to inquire about a birthday gift?

EDIT:Just wanted to thank everyone for their comments. I feel better knowing that I am not just getting too outdated.

63,1e34wui,AITA for not seeing my friend because I’m exhausted,"My friend and I haven’t see each other for about 2-3 months. I’m a full time university student with a job, and she works part time time. We used to see each other every week when we lived near by. But since she graduated and moved for work she lives an hour and a half away. Usually we still see each other every few weeks but she went on a vacation and I’ve had exams and assessment. 

I finally submitted my last piece of uni assessment two days ago, and we had previously been talking about hanging out when I’m done. We hadn’t set a date or made any plans, just agreed that we wanted to see each other. 

Tonight she asked me what I’m doing Monday or Tuesday(it’s currently Sunday night). To which I answered “Working Tuesday, might have a date Monday”. She responded with “prioritising a man over your bestie!?”. I thought this was a joke and responded light heartedly with “you should have asked me yesterday, then I’d be all yours”. She sent back a long message telling me I am a bad friend and that I don’t prioritise her enough, and that when we do hang out she always comes to me. I was very caught off guard, I didn’t think it was that serious and thought she was messing around with her message about prioritising a man. I said we hadn’t sent a day yet or made solid plans, and she said if I cared about her I would have already asked her what days she was off work this week.

I then went on to tell her that actually I don’t have a date, I turned the guy down because I’m exhausted from a big weekend of work and today having travelled a lot for an event I RSVP’d to months in advance, and needed a day to myself to on Monday to rest and recharge. I just mentioned the date before giving her my proper answer because it felt like fun gossip I wanted to share with her (I ended a long term relationship 6 months ago and this is the first time ive been asked on a date/ open to dating since so it’s big news for me). She hasn’t responded to me for several hours and now I’m wondering, am I the asshole? 

For more context. She has a tendency to get very upset when one of our friends gets a partner or has less time for her/ the group. I know it sucks when ur friends become joined at the hip with their partner, but that’s not what I’m talking about. She gets upset from them being slightly less available. She’s never had a relationship of her own. BUT she is right, majority of our hang outs in the past few months has been her coming to me. But that’s because I live in the country and she lives in the city and insists she would rather come to me because she wants a break from the business and misses living in the country. Recently when talking about catching up tho I was  very insisted that she let me do the travelling this time because I feel bad she’s doing it majority or the time and I’d love to see her pets as well.

64,1e341l1,AITA for now refusing to give my mom money?,"Some backstory…
I’ve had a job since I was 16, and I’ve been paying for pretty much everything completely on my own. This includes clothes, shoes, toiletries, university, my phone bill, car insurance, etc. I’m a sophomore in college who is also now (finally) able to buy myself a car, which at this point is a need. My parents are recently separated, with my mom being the only one who helps my siblings and I with anything as my father hasn’t been a “dad” for YEARS.
When my father left, I agreed that I would help my mom with what I can whenever I can. She said that, until child support goes through (I have younger siblings all under 18), she’s going to need some extra help financially. I have absolutely no problem helping as I’ve been doing so whenever needed since I’ve had a job. I even help when it’s not needed, for example: putting gas into her car, buying some food for the house, buying her and/or my siblings some things while i’m out, etc. 
She now is receiving child support and has been for a couple months now. I won’t go into detail on how much that is, but it’s PLENTY. Her paychecks cover most bare necessities, so the child support gives enough for necessities and then some.

Now here’s where things get rough…
She has been constantly telling me that I don’t do enough. I am now being expected to put gas into the car that I quite literally don’t use anymore, pay to fix her car as it’s starting to shit the bed, still continue to give her money (I’ve given her probably 2k within the past 6 months alone, not including things I’ve personally bought to help), AND MORE. Meanwhile, I’m still being expected to pay my bills, pay for my car, pay for university, buy everything I’ll need for university… basically still pay for everything myself.
I work as much as possible, damn near full time, and I make a good bit of money as I also work while going to school, but there is only so much I can do. At this point, I started just focusing on my own finances and I’ve started to help her less as I still have so much more that I need to worry about for myself and my future.
Of course, I will still help when it’s genuinely needed, but I don’t feel that it’s truly needed at this point. She has her income, child support, and income from her new boyfriend. My siblings and I still at this point don’t have everything we need and food is still low in the house. She has a problem with her current budgeting and is trying to put all of that on me. She has been constantly starting arguments and degrading me over all of this.
She has never been like this before, and all of this has never been expected of me until now. This sudden change honestly hurts, and I genuinely feel bad for limiting my financial help, but I think I need to focus more on myself.

There is a LOT of detail and other things that I’m leaving out for privacy reasons and for the fact that some things can’t be mentioned, but this is the basic rundown.

65,1e32yhj,AITA for telling my extended family I'm not dumb and know how things are with them and my dad?,"I (16f) always knew my dad didn't like his family. We saw them very little my whole life. It's really rare that we're with his side. But they're not totally no contact either. It's always tense when we're around each other. Two weeks ago my dad's cousin was in town and there was party for the extended family. I spent most of the time with cousins (dad's cousins kids) who I do see more frequently. At some point an argument started and shit hit the fan. Then I was approached by some extended family and ugh, it was a mess.

So the thing with my dad and his family is my dad is half adopted. His dad/my grandpa died when he was 5 and my his mom/my grandma remarried less than a year after and my dad was adopted by his stepfather by the time he was 7. My dad was never okay with the adoption, he was angry, hurt, and grieved the fact his dad was replaced. He never forgave his mom, he never ever liked his stepfather for doing it and never called him dad or liked him because of it. His mom and stepfather tried to make him change his feelings. When his half siblings were born they were on their parents side. My dad saw it as unforgivable. When he went to college, which I think he went at 17 he told me before, he never went back home. He had really little contact. He didn't invite either his mom or stepfather to his wedding, or his half siblings. I think it was after that they got really pissed at him for still having an issue with being adopted. His name was changed too.

When my parents got married dad changed his last name to my mom's. They told me before she would have taken his last name if his hadn't been changed when he was a kid. To save money they decided to have dad change his once instead of both changing it.

When I was born they named me Morgan, which was dad's original last name and my grandpa's last name. He told me how much the name meant to him, and to mom too because she said she loved how he lit up every time I'm called Morgan.

I know my dad hates his family. He gets along well with his cousins though.

When the argument at the extended family party my dad's mom and stepfather and his half siblings came over to me and they tried to explain stuff to me. They acted like I had no idea what the fight was over, and they told me my dad has some emotional issues and they said he was throwing another tantrum like he did when he named me. But that they all love each other really. I told them I'm not dumb and I know how things are with them. I told them I know my dad hates them and he never wanted to be adopted. Their anger came back, and was directed at me, and they told me I know nothing and surely I can see how childish it is to hate being loved after more than 40 years.

My parents stepped in and we left right after. But I got Facebook messages from some of them afterward saying I should really think before I speak.

66,1e32h1r,WIBTA if I called out my toxic friend,"I'm F17 and have been friends with Suzy (F17) since 5th grade. In our city, high school is only 3 years (10th, 11th, and 12th), and you apply to your desired school in 9th grade. Suzy and I both wanted to major in the same thing, and since there aren’t many schools offering it, we ended up in the same school and class.

The problem is that Suzy has been an awful friend for years. I'm a people pleaser, so I've never addressed it, but it's been building up. Here are some examples:

In 7th grade, I was going through a tough time with family issues and my mental health. Suzy found me having a breakdown and comforted me, encouraging me to share my problems. While still sobbing, I spilled everything that had been piling up for months, and she was supportive at the time. However, last year, she told our current friend group that I ""trauma dumped"" on her and shared all the personal details I had confided in her.

In 10th grade, we practiced for a class debate with opposing views. I provided counterarguments and asked for sources as part of our grade. Suzy started crying, and when friends comforted her, she claimed I got angry because she was winning and verbally attacked her, which wasn't true. This false narrative painted me as the aggressor.

One of the most hurtful incidents was in 9th grade. We discussed if our friend group would stay together, and I expressed confidence in our friendship, calling her my best friend. She looked confused and said, ""Oh, I am? Jessica's my best friend, so I wouldn't count on it \[us staying friends\]."" This made me feel insignificant and question our friendship.

Another incident spanned 7th and 8th grades. A girl named Robin joined our class in 7th grade. She constantly victimized herself for being bisexual, although I and another friend were also bisexual. After she moved back to her home country, she stayed in touch with Suzy. By the end of 8th grade, Suzy found Robin annoying and asked me to tell her to back off. I did, thinking I was being a good friend, but when the situation escalated, Suzy claimed I acted alone and victimized herself again.

I do love Suzy, but I feel like I'm always the one reaching out to maintain our relationship. Even during summer breaks, I am the one who initiates contact. Every time I bring up these issues, Suzy accuses me of attacking her and makes me the bad guy. This pattern has made me question whether our friendship is worth the emotional toll it takes on me.

So, WIBTA if I confronted my toxic friend? I worry that bringing up these issues will lead to more accusations of me being the aggressor, but I also feel that I need to address the ongoing toxicity in our relationship. Also if you think I should confront her please give some tips on how I should.

  
UPDATE: Thank you to everyone who commented it actually really helped! Everyone has given me the advice to just let the relationship fizzle out naturally as she doesn't even deserve a confrontation. I think that this will probably be the best for my mental health and who knows, maybe in the future she'll want to change and rekindle our friendship? I think I'm just pining over the person I thought she was though.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-14,"WIBTA if I called out my toxic friend I'm F17 and have been friends with Suzy (F17) since 5th grade. In our city, high school is only 3 years (10th, 11th, and 12th), and you apply to your desired school in 9th grade. Suzy and I both wanted to major in the same thing, and since there aren’t many schools offering it, we ended up in the same school and class.

The problem is that Suzy has been an awful friend for years. I'm a people pleaser, so I've never addressed it, but it's been building up. Here are some examples:

In 7th grade, I was going through a tough time with family issues and my mental health. Suzy found me having a breakdown and comforted me, encouraging me to share my problems. While still sobbing, I spilled everything that had been piling up for months, and she was supportive at the time. However, last year, she told our current friend group that I ""trauma dumped"" on her and shared all the personal details I had confided in her.

In 10th grade, we practiced for a class debate with opposing views. I provided counterarguments and asked for sources as part of our grade. Suzy started crying, and when friends comforted her, she claimed I got angry because she was winning and verbally attacked her, which wasn't true. This false narrative painted me as the aggressor.

67,1e31ujb,AITA for taking my son back from his dad?,"

 went to pick up my son 2M last wk and when leaving was handed shoes that were not mine. Seemed calculated as they weren't by the door when I arrived. I​ got my shoes and left with my son. I called to go over some things and brought up us seeing other people so we could be on the same page. That if one of us is seeing someone and it is getting serious we can let the other know to discuss, make intros, etc. He agreed. Not a crazy ask.

Not my wkend but he let me have the kid Fri to spend time with my bros who are visiting. I asked if he wanted him Fri night and he said no, Sat morning. I said ok and I would let him know when he woke up. Sat AM I let him know he's up and I can have him ready by the time he arrives. My son asks for food so I start making him some and shortly after there's a knock. I ask if he wants pancakes(he's been unemployed all year and sometimes I offer him food), he says he's fine so I told him I'll make em real quick. He is rushy and fidgety so I tell him the clothes are on the sofa to dress him. Kid starts a FIT which according to him is routine when getting dressed. He asks if he does that with me and I tell him no. I stop to talk to kid and calm him, finish the pancakes and give the container to his dad. Kid is still upset so I told em I could walk em down since I have to take the dog out. My dog does his biz, I kiss my son bye and start back to my apt. I glance around and see movement in the car so I bust a uturn. There is a woman sitting in the car. I look at him and ask if he's serious and with a dumb face he says what? I grab my son out of his car seat and take him back. He follows and we argue. 

I told him we JUST spoke about this and came to an agreement and he said he knew I would not react positively so he decided to just do what he wanted. I expressed my issue was not what he was doing but how he just did it. I dont know this person and from what he says he probably doesn't know her well either. I do not feel comfortable having someone introduced to my child at this stage and being around him. We still cosleep with our child so where is this person sleeping? He left upset and I kept my son for the day.

He is trying to gaslight me into thinking that my request is bonkers.

I went back down to apologize. What happened was not her fault and let her know I wasn't mad with her. She seemed fine and assured me she didn't know and that's it's super casual and sporadic and she didn't want to step on anyone's toes. On his end he says it's his girlfriend and I'm keeping him from having a family and happiness. He complains about time with his son but I offered him on Friday, he was with her as I confirmed with her. We both have two weekdays and every other weekend child free. 

We quit counseling in May and he has been seeing her since May. She seems nice enough but I do not know her and do not trust just anyone around my child.

Yesterday, we had a school trip. My friend (16f) and I (16f) arrived a little earlier than our two other friends (also 16f), so we got on the bus first. We're quite close, and there were no empty seats next to anyone else, so I assumed she’d want to sit next to me. I sat down and assumed she’d sit next to me. However, she chose to sit somewhere else. I was a little confused and thought maybe she believed I didn’t want her to sit next to me, so I told her she could sit near me if she wanted to. She did.

When our two other friends arrived, she got up, told one of them to sit next to me, and sat next to our other friend. I was a little taken aback, but I thought she just wanted some space from me, so I gave her that. I only talked to her when she initiated conversation and made sure to sit elsewhere at other times.

71,1e31058,AITA for refusing to inspect a friends condo for free? ,"Hi everyone, 
Wanted to get reddits opinion on something 

I’m in my late twenties, a few years ago I started a Handyservice company as a side gig to help supplement my income. I work full time but on work nights and weekends do handyservice stuff. I make about 55k at my day job and around 30k with my handyservice stuff I do pretty everything from small jobs to bigger projects like kitchen/bathroom renovations.

One of my good friends (makes 100k+) recently bought a condo and got mad at me because I have refused to come to their condo to give them opinions/inspect work that they had a different GC do/messed up. 
Normally I would be happy to do that sort of thing but the problem is they live close to 2 hours round trip from where I am based. 

I told them either let’s grab dinner or something to make it worth the drive and trip. Or just pay me for my time and efforts would be about 150 bucks for the trip fee and inspection report. 
They flat out got got mad at me saying it should be a favor since they have helped me out last minute on previous big jobs (not for free, I paid them above market rate for labor at 24/hr for their time) 

It’s pretty far drive and my free time is limited as is and the last thing I want to do is drive 1 hour, pay for parking (it’s a major city) do an inspection and drive back 1 hr. It’s not like they cannot afford to pay the fee more that they are being cheap imo.

This past year has been tough for him. His business started to decline and because of the extremely rainy winter he didn’t work much. He needed help and asked for help with the promise in writing to pay me back. 

The last seven months we have argued because of the money as he made choices that cost money rather than finding other work to supplement his income. I needed the money paid by now which he knew and has only made one payment since last November. The debt is a combination of money loans and use of my credit card. He plays sports and goes out to dinner and to sporting events. Last week we had a long nice talk and came to some great understandings because I’ve been struggling financially because of him. 

Then  as he was leaving the next morning he told me he was going camping for the 4th with his son and family. I asked how he could afford to go if he had no money and hasn’t paid all his bills this month and why he wasn’t trying to pick up odd jobs. He ignored that question. 

My friends did some snooping without my knowing because of the financial struggles he has caused and because he had gone to my home two days ago and turned off my power causing my security system to go out so he could go inside my home without my knowledge. I still don’t know why as I’m visiting my kids and not home. 

Turns out he was away with a girlfriend for the weekend instead. Posting hotels and dining out and all sorts of things. They left for their trip the same day we just spent the night together.

She looked up other flats within our little village and send them to me, always telling me ""your brother and I would be okay living there!"" or ""you could walk to your mom's place from this flat!"".
Which made me angry to the point I texted her ""I just love how you know what's best for me, even better than I do."" Obviously being sarcastic.
To which she flipped. She started calling me names, saying I was ungrateful, that I shouldn't count on her help anymore  because I wasn't deserving of it.

I stood my ground but rn I'm thinking that maybe I was wrong. Maybe I shouldn't move away. But on the other hand I really love this flat and the idea of starting new, away from my family, seems too good to be true.

Am I the asshole for wanting things my way and not being grateful for my sil's help, even though I never asked for it?  

EDIT:
Some asked about my brother's perspective in all of this.
My brother is on her side, he told me I shouldn't have been ""angry texting"" my sil (he was referring to the sarcastic comment I made; ""I love how you know what's best for me"").
He said I should apologize and think about how much work my sil has on a daily basis. That she has had so much stress lately and STILL managed to find some flats for me nearby.
I told him maybe she should walk in my shoes for a day and then we can talk. He didn't take it well.

The flat is basically the same distance away from my working place as my mother's flat is, just opposite directions. It is a bit expensive,  it's a big flat (about 80m²), rent and everything (loan payback, car insurance etcetc) sums up to about half of my monthly salary.

77,1e2ypiy,AITA for telling my uncle that the only reason we’re speaking in his language is because he doesn’t know mine,"My parents immigrated to the US before any of my siblings or I was born, but all of their family stayed behind in their home country (Vietnam). I grew up learning Vietnamese and speaking it at home, to the point that I’ve been told by people in Vietnam that my pronunciation is pretty much indistinguishable from a fully native speaker, although my vocabulary is definitely not the best since English is my main language in the vast majority of day to day stuff.   
  
I recently went on a family trip back to Vietnam to visit extended family. I’d graduated college since the last time I visited, so my uncle asked me what I majored in (aerospace engineering). I don’t know how to say that in Vietnamese and he knows pretty much zero English so I said that I didn’t know what it was called and then kinda described it. He made a guess based off what I described (and I don’t really know what his guess meant) and I just said I think so, and then he made a snarky comment about how anyone whose parents are both native Vietnamese speakers should also be fully fluent in it.    
   
Later at some point, I had to go to the doctor for some medical issue and my uncle was there in addition to my parents. I was able to describe all my symptoms and stuff and the doctor prescribed me a couple medications, but afterwards I asked my parents to explain what each medication was for since I didn’t fully understand.   
    
My uncle made another comment about how I *clearly* don’t use Vietnamese enough at home and should use it more, and then I kinda snapped and said that I was good enough at it for my own satisfaction. He like smirked at that and was like “it’s your native language, you should be better” and then I replied with something along the lines of “no my native language is English, the only reason we’re conversing in Vietnamese right now is because that’s the only language you know”.   
    
After that it was kinda weird, we usually don’t interact all that much but I’ve been steering clear of him because it still annoyed me. But idk if my response was too mean

78,1e2ybiu,AITA for telling my dad's wife his lies are not my fault and she shouldn't blame me for him saying she would be my new mom?,"I (17m) was forced to go to therapy with my dad and his wife Haley three months ago and as of our session on Thursday I am in pretty deep shit and want to know if I'm wrong.

Timeline:

My mom died when when I was 7. This was in September 2014.  
Dad and Haley met in December 2014. They started dating in January 2015.  
I met Haley in March 2015 at my 8th birthday party.  
Haley moved in with us in May of 2015.  
Dad and Haley got married in July of 2015.

Haley always wanted to be a mom. I have heard her say it a million times. She can't have biological kids. I believe she's actually sterile and not just infertile so like no chance. Dad knew she wanted kids. He wanted to marry again and he wanted to have someone else take over raising me. But my dad never wanted more kids. I think Haley was a great option in his eyes. But he knew I wouldn't be okay with a new mom, that I wouldn't want to call someone else my mom. So he lied to her about it and said I would want that, that she'd be my new mom but rushed the marriage so she wouldn't realize the truth.

I don't accept Haley as my new mom. She has tried and I know most of it is genuinely her trying to be a good ""mom"" but I have a mom, she's dead, she's still my mom. I told Haley this. She ignored me and continued on like I said nothing. I spoke to dad and saw that he wasn't going to do anything. So Haley invested all her time and effort into me. Dad was really not around much. I was trying to be independent and not rely on Haley. There were times she told me she'd help me with homework but I'd do it in school or I'd finish it while she was doing chores. I started doing chores without her. She would always try to ""help"" but I would do things when I'd first wake up. I started asking friends parents if they could drive me to school. I did everything to minimize what she was doing for me. Not everything was possible. She still did cooking and cleaning and taking me to doctors appointments. But sometimes I would pretend not to be sick to avoid it.

I don't know what led to therapy but I was forced to go with them three months ago and Haley was talking about her wishes to be a mom, how her and dad's marriage wasn't what she thought it would be, how I'm not the son she thought she was getting and how it annoys her that I'm so cold and distant with her. Then on Thursday after some stuff was said last week about things dad said I told her dad lied, that I never wanted a new mom and he knew it. She said I shouldn't say those things and I'm just making life unfair and more difficult. That I'm not doing what I should. I told her dad's lies are not my fault and she shouldn't blame me for him saying she would be my new mom. I told her I had no part in that.

Both dad and Haley after therapy yelled at me and called me disrespectful. Haley told me I was ungrateful and should have been thrilled to have someone else want to mother me instead of ruining her chance at motherhood.

I come from a hardworking and humble immigrant family where my parents migrated to the West barely knowing any English. They worked their butts off and dad eventually got into med school with my mom fully supporting him. They both worked odd jobs to support the family and my dad finally graduated from med school in his early 40s (both my sister and I were born by then). It was hard at first looking for a job and settling in but eventually our family went from sharing one room between the 4 of us to now living in a more than comfortable home. We are by no means millionares, just have enough money to live comfortably and go on trips every couple of years. 

  
My sister recently graduated from med school also and there is this medicine conference to be held in Antarctica. My sister and dad are super keen to go, especially my dad as he is an avid traveller and one of his life goals is to visit Antarctica with the family so this was the perfect chance as mom is his plus one and I am my sister's plus one. I am very aware that I am privileged and lucky to have this opportunity and am that I am considered well off due to my family's efforts over the years.  My parents offered to pay for the whole trip but my sister and I felt bad so we ended up paying half of our own fees, while my parents covered the rest. 

  
My issue is that most people around me (friends, colleagues etc.) come from average households and often have different values on where money should be spent and, since they found out about my dad's occupation, I have felt that they are now treating me differently and view me as some spoilt rich kid born with a golden spoon without knowing my story. It makes me very uncomfortable so I have always been very lowkey about my family's circumstances and fear of people finding out.

80,1e2xrpq,AITA for refusing to financially support my pregnant daughter and her family?,"Let me give some history on my daughter and her life to explain why we're in this position. My daughter was 18 when she told me she wanted to marry her boyfriend of a year. My husband and I (both 60s currently) did not want to see her get married so young, either of them, and we advised them to wait and keep dating. To live life a little first. His family had the same response. So to ""show us all"" they could do it, they went and got married at the courthouse with just some of their friends as witnesses. Once they were married my husband and I tried to be supportive without getting in the way. They were so young but also old enough to make decisions for themselves and we did not want to be those parents who step in and make things worse again.

The marriage was doomed from the start but they had two children together. My grandson Indigo (now 12m) was first and he was followed by my granddaughter Skye (now 11f). My grandchildren were loved but their parents were not happy together. Their dad was not a good husband to my daughter, but he was an excellent father and my daughter was not a good wife to their dad but she was a good mom. He died a few days before my granddaughters 5th birthday. My daughter found love quickly afterward and married her current husband even faster than her first.

From the time they said I do, my daughter and her husband have spent tens of thousands trying to make my grandchildren his. They went to court for him to adopt them but the judge asked to speak with the children and said no after their meeting. They appealed the decision and lost again. They paid thousands for a therapist to speak in court about the benefit of adopting for the kids. The court assigned their own therapist and denied the request again. The only real ""break"" from this was when the courts were only handling emergency hearings and adoption requests were delayed due to the pandemic. But once they could they were back at it. My husband and I asked why our daughter didn't wait to allow the kids the choice. But she wouldn't hear tell of it. They borrowed money to pay for these therapists and lawyers and court fees. Each time the request to adopt was denied by a judge.

Now my daughter is pregnant by her husband and they do not have the money they once did. It all went on the many failed attempts to adopt my grandchildren. My daughter turned to us (husband and myself) about a month ago now and shared how tight their finances are and asked for our help financially. My husband and I told her we would discuss it but we're on the same page, we do not feel we should help. We feel like doing so will allow our daughter and her husband to continue this pointless adoption pursuit and is not in the best interest of the family. My daughter was furious when we told her no. She asked how we can turn our backs on family. She has said we are clearly not fit to be parents or grandparents.

My girlfriend always likes his instagram posts but I always ignore them because he annoys me. Am I the asshole for that?",,1.058872103691101,1,0
82,1e2wrhn,AITA for Needing the Car During a Family Crisis?,"My 74 father was recently discharged from the hospital earlier than expected after a biopsy confirmed he has invasive moderately differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma.

Initially, he was hospitalized because he overexerted himself by going to work against doctors orders two hours after his biopsy operation, which required anesthesia. Twenty-four hours later, he couldn't walk and was stuck in the bathroom, necessitating a 911 call due to his weakness. We only learned of the carcinoma days into his hospital visit, which further intensified growing family tensions. Despite being frail, he demanded to be released early and even pressed going to work tonight. As much as I respect his determination, he refuses to admit his limitations.

I live in the Philly area and had to drive up to Scranton due to my father being released early and the family reaching a boiling point. It was like trying to put a lid on a pot of boiling water; I needed to support my family and help soothe tensions arising from my father's inability to accept his aging body and my mom's refusal to see it.

However, my wife Sally refused to let me use our one shared car to drive back and help my parents during this family emergency. She insisted needed the vehicle for her babysitting gigs and I was not ""hearing her out"". Despite my offer to pay for her Ubers and a weekly local rental car, she insisted on keeping our car. This forced me to spend hundreds more and waste time lyfting to a rental car from the airport instead of a cheaper option within walking distance of our home the next morning for her.

Feeling exasperated, I said I would handle everything on my own and get a Lyft to the airport. She then claimed I’m being unempathetic to her needs and unreasonable.

My parents and brother and I have family meeting tomorrow to discuss his future cancer treatments and the will for the family business. I don't expect it to go well and I really feel like I could have used a break and my wife couldn't see where I'm at.

83,1e2w6v8,AITA for telling my sister and her bf that their trip “doesn’t matter”?,"My (26F) sister (20F) and her boyfriend (21M) had a weeklong trip planned to a city about a 5 hour drive away. 

Tragically, 2 weeks before they were about to leave, our cousin (27M) died in an accident. We were all very shocked and saddened by this but my sister’s boyfriend’s first genuine reaction was “hope this doesn’t ruin our trip”. 

My sister and I are not incredibly close, so I invited her out to lunch after flying in. When I picked her up for lunch, her bf also got in the car. Even tho I had not invited him and wanted to just spend time with my sister, I did not say anything as I didn’t want to cause issues. Both of them then sat in the back while I drove. 

On the drive, my sister’s boyfriend was complaining about how my mom wasn’t telling them when the funeral is. Since the death was an accident, the body had not been released. While we had a date for the funeral in mind (he does know this date), no one could confirm until investigators released the body. I explained this to him, and said that my mom (idk why he was blaming her) has no control over this. He demanded he needed to know when the funeral was, so that they could know whether or not they had to cancel the trip. He claimed that “everyone is acting like our trip doesn’t matter right now”.

I again said that we just don’t know and that no one is trying to hide anything. I said that “frankly, your trip doesn’t matter right now”, as there are more important things, like an unexpected death, to focus on rn. I said that if he was this concerned, maybe they should reschedule the trip to be safe (for context, they are staying with a friend and would not lose any money if they did this). He scoffed and said that he can’t just expect the friend, who they are staying with, to just be available at the drop of a hat. He said that I don’t understand how important this trip was to them. I said that I’m sorry that things are up in the air, but life happens.

We then got to lunch, where I paid (was not thanked by my sister or her bf). Now they are calling me an AH for not taking their trip seriously, and they are demanding that my parents pay for a hotel if they have to reschedule.

85,1e2vyps,WIBTA for telling my mom that my brother is failing college,"My brother and I go to the same college at the moment, but soon I will be transferring to another school and leave my brother alone. This is a problem because recently I found out my brother failed 2 out of his 4 classes last semester and he has begged me not to tell our mom because she would be pissed off.

Here's some important information before I continue, this is my brother's second college, he was basically kicked out of his first college for poor grades. My mom decided he could go to the same college as me so I could keep an eye on him, which I admittedly have not been doing because I was a bit childish and thought it was annoying I would have to keep an eye on my fully grown, older brother. I will take blame, knowing it was my job and I led to his problem now.

The reason why I want to tell my mom is because in his first semester at his second college, my mom watched him like a hawk and made sure he was passing his classes. She was basically the reason he wasn't able to slack off and forget to do homework. However, now that he's been given full trust, he's failing again.

The reason why this would make me the asshole is because my mom told my brother if he failed his classes again, she would take away all his privileges like video games and his car, and practically never let him leave her sight. I would be the cause of my mom knowing his dark secret and maybe ruining any sense of freedom he has in the household.

Maybe it's none of my business and I should keep my mouth shut, but I also know that my brother has nothing else he has in store for his future other than following my mom's footsteps and he needs a degree to do so. This is really more of a would I be helping or hurting him situation. So would I be the asshole if I told my mom my brother is failing?

Edit: I should probably clarify that his car and video games being revoked are not the only punishments. Those are just the ones she explicitly said.

At this point, I decided to go outside and kindly asked them to lower the volume. Instead of complying, they responded with insults.

Despite their rude reaction, I hoped they would eventually quiet down and turn off the music or at least lower the volume. But after another hour of enduring the noise, I went out again around 1 am to ask them to stop. Once again, they insulted me and ignored my request.

88,1e2vbwx,WIBTA is if I (31M) talked to my aunt about my uncle’s behavior towards me while visiting their house?,"Long story short. I am close to my aunt (my mom’s sister), my uncle, and my cousins. My mom and my aunt have been close forever. She is like a second mom to me. Despite the age differences between my little cousins (at least 10+ year difference) and I , we’re very close. We tease each other but we’ve always been there for each other through the good and bad. They’re like younger siblings to me. It’s been a blessing to have them  in my life and to watch them grow up. 

My aunt, uncle, and cousins relocated to our state years ago. My aunt and uncle always tell me I can come visit them without an invite. I am always welcomed in their home. Despite, my busy schedule, I try to come every few weeks to spend time with them. I always ask before visiting. Sometimes, I take my cousins out to dinner, movies, etc. Also, I send them small gifts as well. My aunt and uncle always encourage my cousins and I to spend time together. 

Today, I was their area of town. I live about an hour away. I was running some errands nearby. I texted my aunt and uncle if it was okay to visit just to be courteous. They said it was fine. After running errands, I went to their house. I rang the doorbell twice. No answer. I heard my uncle’s voice but he didn’t answer the door. I knocked on the door and after five minutes, one of my little cousins answer the door. 

I greeted everyone including my aunt and uncle. My aunt was working from home today so I kept my greetings short and left her to her work. My uncle greeted me but didn’t say anything else, which was odd.  I eventually made small talk with him while I helped my youngest cousin (he is autistic and requires special care) eat his food. My uncle had to work on something so I hung out with the rest of my cousins. We hung out, talked, and watched YouTube videos. My uncle occasionally would call my younger cousins to help him do something. If my little cousins didn’t hear their dad call them the first time, I would remind them that their dad is calling them and to go find him.

Well, my uncle got mad at one of my cousins, and came out of the living room. We were in the kitchen. My uncle asked me if needed to run any additional errands today. I said no. He then told me that he needs me to stop interfering with his kids tasks and went to his bedroom. It was awkward and uncomfortable.

90,1e2ujz1,AITA for making my BIL homeless and embarrassing him? ,"My sister’s husband “Mark” left her and their 12 year old son “Alex” about a year ago. His reason was that Alex was too difficult to deal with. I think Mark is a piece of crap who blames his son for everything. Alex is a bit hyper and he does get into trouble for being distracted, impulsive etc but he’s not a bad kid? 

He loved his dad very much but he’s not stupid. He quickly figured out why his dad left and hates his guts now. Not that I blame him. He’s been through a lot and to put it very plainly, he thinks his mom might just up and leave one day too. 

Because of this, there will be nights where he won’t go to sleep unless his mom sits with him. My sister would never abandon him like his dad did but Alex is way too anxious. He used to wake up several times throughout the night just to make sure she was still there. He’s LOADS better now, and my sister can go to bed in her room after putting him to sleep.

Obviously, we don’t tell anyone in our lives about this as it would be extremely embarrassing for Alex. I only know because I currently live with them (I’m helping around the house+with Alex). Unfortunately, Mark called a couple nights ago wanting to apologize (allegedly) and him and my sister had a pretty nasty fight about Alex and my sister ended up telling Mark about the sleeping problem. Mark was pretty surprised (allegedly) but just hung up. 

I figured he actually felt some guilt towards his son for once but I heard Alex going crazy in his room and when I went to calm him down he just showed me his phone and he got exactly 3 texts from his dad telling him to “man up”, “stop annoying his mom” and “if he didn’t man up he’d tell all of Alex’s friends”. 

I was appalled. Second my sister came home I marched straight to Mark’s mom’s house (where I knew Mark was staying) and chewed him out. I don’t think I’m the asshole for that, he deserved it. But Mark’s mom and his sisters and their husbands and kids were home and I told them what Mark’s been saying about his own child. I didn’t have to, it’s none of their business, but I knew they adore Alex and his mom was extremely angry. One of his sisters even went “WTF is wrong with you.” Now Mark’s mom is giving him a week to find somewhere else to live and he’s yelling at me for essentially making him homeless and dragging his entire family into things. 

He called me a dumb kid and said idk what it feels like to be a parent and that he’s human too. He admits that he could’ve been more decent with Alex too so perhaps he’s reflecting (I doubt it). I suppose I went too far regardless. AITA?

I enjoy baking and cooking, but my mom rules the kitchen and gets upset whenever we use her stuff. She established a rule: ""Don't bake or cook without asking me first.""

To my memory, I've never burnt or ruined anything I've made. However, if I ask her, ""Hey mom, can I bake something?"" she'll come up with a million reasons why I shouldn't, so I end up not baking or cooking. The only way I can ever cook or bake is if I don't ask her, which has worked many times. Once, I made chicken tacos, and she didn't get mad except for thinking I didn't make any for my sister (which I did).

Another issue is that my mom sometimes stops cooking when she's upset. Because of this, from a young age, I had to learn how to make lunch for my sister and me. I remember many sleepless nights trying to figure out something to make with limited ingredients. She never apologized or thanked me.

One day, I came home from school and wanted to meal-prep. My mom had never seen me meal-prep before since I usually did it around 1-2 AM. I had some raw chicken out to defrost and was frying some, but she got furious, telling me I didn't know how to handle raw chicken and that the meals I made were unhealthy. This made me never want to cook around her or ask her because she would just get angry.

Yesterday, I wanted to make brownies and cookies around 1 AM. I didn't want to ask my mom because she'd yell at me, and I'd rather not cry myself to sleep. So, I made a batch of brownies and cookies using 4 of the 20 eggs we had. The next day, my mom got very upset. She asked who I made the brownies for, and I told her 'nobody.' She got mad that I left some unused pans out and said the 4 eggs I used were for someone else, which she hadn't mentioned before. If I had known, I wouldn't have touched them.

She reiterated that I wasn't allowed to cook or bake without asking her and said other things that upset me, but I can't remember because I had just woken up 10 minutes prior and was in a terrible mental state. Now, both my mom and I are upset. Is it my fault? I think I'm just mad at her actions and her rules. Honestly, I think I'm mad because she makes me lose sleep to make lunch for my sister and me when she doesn't want to cook. When it's times like that, I obviously don't have to ask her, but when it doesn't directly benefit her, I do?

92,1e2uf1a,AITA for refusing to give my room to my married cousin,"I’m very upset as I’m writing this so there might be errors so pls bear with me.

On a 1 week family vacation, 
My immediate family aren’t here

My dad got me a room at the hotel we were all staying, so I could have my own room
My cousins (32F), I’ll call her Jo, her husband I’ll call him Bill & their 2 kids had the room next to mine. 

The 2nd day my cousins & I wanted to go to the beach. Jo asked if she could stay in my room bcos her husband & kids were disturbing her rest. I said ok & gave her my room card. 
We were gone for like the whole day, when we returned, Jo was still in my room. She had been watching TV, she had actually rented a movie!!! I was angry at this bcos it was my dad’s credit card on the billing for the room, she apologized & left. 
The next day she asked to use my room again promised not to rent a movie & I agreed.
When I returned, Bill was in my room laying on my bed. I wasn’t mad, but I also didn’t like it. I asked them to leave that I needed to get ready since we were all going out to eat.

We’re at the restaurant eating, joking around, having a nice time, when my aunt (Jo’s mom) [the official “adult” of the family vacay] said & I quote “you’ll be sleeping in Jo’s room with the kids so your elder sister & her husband can have some privacy”. 
I honestly didn’t think she was talking to me until my uncle snapped at me asking if I was deaf. 
I looked around, everyone was looking at me, waiting for my “ok or yes, ma”
But I said no
The vibe of our table changed. 
My aunt basically ordered me to hand over my room card, again, I said no. 
She then said it was wrong of me to expect adults to be sleeping in the same room with their kids when another child has a free room (I’m 22 but I’m also the youngest) [sorry I’m 24]
Again I said no & asked her to ask someone else
At this everyone turned on me asking why I needed a room to myself, what was I doing by myself that would make me not want to share with kids
It was so uncomfortable I left
The next day, we had plans to go to the theme park, but they all left without me. I called my cousins, but they won’t pick up
I texted & was left on read
I called my dad about this & he told me not to worry he’ll handle it
Dinner that night, I was called a snitch, that I had run to my dad when I was the one being disrespectful. Then my aunty asked me to leave the table or give my “elder sister“ my room card. (It was like a go to your room moment), so I went to my room called my dad again & this time he told me to just change rooms to hold the peace
My mom & brothers said not to, that they were looking for a free babysitter (her kids aren’t unruly half the time) but I’m not here to babysit
Today, I was left behind again
I don’t know, I’m really upset about this but I also don’t want to give in. I’m thinking to just go home, but it’s quite expensive to change my ticket
So 3 days left of this. 😢😢😢

94,1e2ty2a,AITA for blowing up at a friend that didn't take my sudden financial situation seriously?,"So, a bit of context first: I am 34 years old and I currently live with my parents, by choice.
My dad is sickly and my mum is his carer, but the amount of work she does exhausts her, so I moved back in to ease her burden.

I also help them out financially.
They find it hard, with rent and medication payments, so I help out.
If they need some money for anything else that they can't cover, I'm more than willing to help.

I am fortunate enough to be in a decent paying job where I have a small amount of disposable income that I can provide them with each pay.

However, I also have a decent amount of savings. However, that savings is basically for eventually buying a house and not having to rent anymore and also in case of emergency, such as anything with my dad and what I'm about to talk about.

So, with the context above, let me get into it;

At the start of last week, the engine in my parents car basically blew up and we found out they needed it replaced; a very important task as they need their transport, just in case of emergency.

They need a whole new engine, and they were looking at having to spend around $8.5K in order to replace it.

They, don't have that kind of money lying around, so they turned to me, and I was more than happy to oblige... but that meant having to dip into my savings.
I was potentially looking at -$8.5K out of the blue.

It rocked me, but I would do anything for them, and they promised to pay me back slowly, so we worked it out between us.

That being said, I had several savings and financial goals to hit this year... mostly involving putting down a deposit for a house and having a comfortable amount underneath me for anything else.

This, finally, leads us to the conflict;
I went to the group of friends I consider my closest and told them what was going on and how I was going to slightly pull back on social activities for the next couple of months that involved having to spend money, because I wanted to save up as much as I had again and still try to hit my savings goals but I was still down for events that required little or no money, such as house parties.

One of those friends then made a rather snide joke, along the lines of, ""man, I wish I was broke with $x"" ... which the rest of the group then laugh reacted.
I felt that was rude so I confronted him.
He doubled down and said, ""I just don't think it's right to say you're essentially broke when you have all of this money at your disposal.""

I was offended. They all knew about my financial situation and why I am saving... I reiterated, though, thinking that maybe he had simply forgotten... and yet, he still ended up being snide.

It hurt, seeing their reactions, when they know exactly what I'm going through.
I blew up, saying that although they're my closest group of friends, my only real support base, the fact that they find it hard to care just because of how much money is in my savings, despite them knowing what it's there for, really hurt.

We happily allowed her and with her mother’s approval, booked the cruise in March with them paying a $200 deposit and the remaining $600 due the end of April. As the payment due date approached I reached out to the mother via text letting her know the payment was coming due. The mother said “okay, thank you”. The date came(5 days later) we had not received the payment but paid for the reservation in full so the friend would not lose her spot. The mother texted within the next few days apologizing for her delay in paying and wanted to drive the money over to us that day. It was a Sunday, they live a distance away so we declined and asked to have her daughter give our daughter the money at their next dance class(they danced together several times a week).  We saw the mother at dance competitions and recitals and she gave a few excuses as to why she couldn’t pay. First, she was making her daughter save the money from a new job to pay us, then it was they were going to pay us but ultimately, they never paid. We texted back and forth with the mother thanking us for all we do for her daughter and she would pay by the weekend or whatever. The last time we communicated was 6/18/24, she said we would get our payment that coming weekend and thanked us again for all we do for her daughter. This brings us to this week where I tried again to get payment and firm up plans with the trip being 2 weeks away. I texted and the mom never responded.

It's true that one of the biggest flaws we had in our friendship and in our group of Friends at the time was communication, we struggled or even didn't talk about our feelings, wishes, things that makes us unconfortable of one another, etc... That's a subject that we didn't really pay attention but we started to notice and begin to change it a couple of years ago, slowly. Our friend group shifted beacause of life, work, and people leaving and arriving but we ended up with a quite nice friend group that we all tried to be more communicative with one another, and all thanks to a couple of new additions to the friend group that had that very nice communication skills, let's call one of these friends Simon. About 5 months ago Simon and Josh started to get very close, I'm going to say for the record before we continue that while it's true that in the past I would have feel jelousy of that because of abandonment issues, I made peace with that part of me long ago and that does not happen anymore. 



As I said before, Simon has very polished communication skills, and it's something that Josh loves about him, we all do, and he wanted to learn how to be more communicative like him. I, on the other hand, lag a bit behind. Obviously this changes take time, and I'm working in my issues and inner demons, trying my best with the tools I have at the moment, but in my eyes that is something that Josh does not get and wants me to be that level asap but I feel like I would be pushing myself too much.

""You told me this and this is the wrong way to think of this issue!"" ""You assumed again, see? I don't see you trying, are you even?"". Josh was sulking by his own commitment on me changing, and that led to a breaking point, where he said that he was done, that I wasn't a safe space anymore, and he would step back a bit in our friendship, to be ""less close"" and less commited, that we would still be friends and he would still invite me to group plans and stuff but not as close as before. That was a month ago and I can feel the sudden change on how he treats me, finishing conversations abruptly/not interacting with me.

For context, we live in a student apartment not far from my college campus so a grown woman choosing to live in a shitty college student apartment is a little odd to say the least. 

She seems pretty normal and we get along ok although her english isnt great so we havent really havent had more of a conversation beyond a smile and a greeting. Ever since shes moved in, theres been this terrible hacking/ coughing sound coming from her room whenever she takes a shower. Its the sound of someone hocking up a loogie over and over and it lasts for at least 10 minutes and happens every morning and night usually at pretty odd or late hours. 

At first I actually thought it was someone making that noise in the living room, but her hacking is so bad that I can hear it through her door, all the way down the hall, and through my door pretty clearly. I was willing to overlook it and not say anything since its pretty weird to ask someone to be more quiet when theyre hocking up a loogie but just the frequency it happens at and just that fact that she has no regard / or awareness of her surroundings is kind of making the whole situation unbearable. 

Shes basically taken over the whole fridge and freezer (I wish I were exaggerating) but she keeps all her food in grocery bags to distinguish them and has overtaken the whole fridge space so that I literally dont have any room for my stuff. Seriously, I only have a dozen eggs in the fridge and even then I was barely able to pack it in with the rest of her crap. Shes also never taken out the trash, bought paper towels, etc.

I feel bad because I'm not sure if its a health related issue or if shes sick because no normal person should be producing that much phlegm unless shes just forcing it up in the shower, but she seems perfectly fine to me whenever I see her (not sick) and she doesnt seem to be coughing any other time just when she makes that awful sound.

I wrote a note while she was hacking up a lung in the shower one night basically being like ""so sorry to bother you, just wanted to let you know youre being a little loud in the shower. if you dont mind, i would appreciate if you kept the noise level down later at night."" and slipped it under her door.

102,1e2sy42,AITA for telling my husband to stop eating like hes never seen food before?,"I'll try to make this short, but don't judge just off the title. I(29f) went out for dinner with husband (28m) last night - nothing fancy just a chain sports bar - and it being a Friday, the place was packed. We sit, place our order, and we're catching up on the day everything is going fine. 

When the waitress brought out our appetizer, my husband grabs about 4 decent sized tortilla chips and scoops an actual mountain of spinach dip with them and shoved the whole thing in his mouth. And when I say shoved I mean SHOVED his fingers in his mouth with the food. By the time I'd had 3 chips with some dip the entire rest of the appetizer was gone so I was already irked and embarrassed because of course people were staring at us. 

I said as much to him and when he said he didn't see what he was doing wrong, I told him ""you're acting like you've never seen food before, it's embarrassing."" He didn't say another word to me after that, and has barely spoke to me today either. I don't think I'm the asshole for telling him I was embarrassed by how he was eating and annoyed that most of the appetizer was eaten by him, but I may have taken it too far with the last comment. 

For further context no, this isn't the first time this has happened. I've told him multiple times it's embarrassing when he does this and asked him why so I can try to help or at least understand a bit better. It's only at this specific chain and his answer always is either idk or that he ""really loves the spinach dip"" they have. He also does this at home but I don't really care when he's at home because I'm not going to dictate how he acts in the privacy of our house. 

Also to note because I'm sure people may ask, no he did not grow up in a food insecure household, they weren't rich but not struggling that much. And neither are we struggling now.  No there is no history with an eating disorder either in him or his family.

**Edit because people keep asking the same questions so just for clarity:

106,1e2s98n,AITA for telling my friend she’s a bad driver,"
Me, 22F, and my best friend, 23f, took our driver’s tests on the same day when we were 16. Based off of our local requirements, we could take the text through our high school and depending on our score, we wouldn’t have to take it at the DMV over the summer. The minimum requirement was an 85/100. I scored an 86 and she scored a 96. Since then, she has held it over me that she is a better driver, but she’s not. 

Recently, she’s been in two car accidents. The first one was in March when she was driving on a highway with a lot of exits, riding too close to a semi and in his blind spot. Because of this, she was run off the road when he was trying to merge back into the right lane as she was using that lane to pass him. The second accident was when she was on a 55mph country road, that she takes daily, and drove off the road on the S-shaped curve that she drives every single day. 

While in the car with her, I’ve noticed that she does not take any precautions. She often will let her car roll (she was letting her car go and got mad at the man in the crosswalk for tapping the hood), blow through yellow lights. One of my biggest things is that she never seems to be aware of her surroundings. She never checks when she backs out of parking spaces and drives all over the place in parking lots. 

Today, we were going to the city and she didn’t give me a choice. She’s going to drive. I told her I could take over if she didn’t want to. She said no. During the day, she ran a red light in front of a cop, nearly rear ended someone because she was texting, and also tried to play the “my dad’s a veteran” line with the officer who gave her a warning.

On the way home, she started ranting about how other people are the problem and she wouldn’t have almost rear ended them if they would have gone with the green light (it was red). I told her that it was her fault and that it could have been a really bad accident. I tried to tell her that car accidents can do a lot of damage, even if they’re not that bad on the surface. I’ve never been in an accident but I’ve seen plenty and it’s scary. I may have gone a little mom-ish about it, but it’s not just her life. When you’re driving, you’re responsible for everyone nearby. I told her she needs to be more aware and stop trying to fix her makeup, text her mom back, or mess with the radio. She tried to brush it off and say that it wasn’t a big deal, that other people should be better drivers. I stayed quiet and later I received a text about how she’s very offended if imply that she’s a bad driver, then brought up the stupid test score from when we were 15.

109,1e2r8ch,AITA for snapping at someone over a loaded comment?,"Ok, so. My(27NB) roommate(24NB) has a partner(20sF) who has spent a lot of time around in the past few months, including times when roomie is not at home. For a while she and I were friends (we're both native and into some of the same hobbies), and she had been pretty generous with me, giving things like plants, and food - I gave her what I could in return, like my beads or an electric toothbrush at one point. I'm ashamed to admit I didnt always use her gifts well - I have pretty severe depression and struggle with executive dysfunction (meaning I often struggle to do even things I want to do and enjoy doing)- but I always did my best. The incident happened a few weeks ago and fallout has been happening ever since. 

Leading up to this, she had been commenting on things like the space being messy, my taste in music, or my hair in ways that felt passive aggressive but I struggled to put my finger on. She would also argue about little things like how to pronounce a word (tbf I argued back) or criticize shows I had on. 

Anyway, the incident. I was in the kitchen getting some food before I went to work. One of the ways my trauma and executive dysfunction can show up is food waste - I had an ex who would make gross undercooked vegan food and didnt take constructive criticism, and would also be very upset with me when I didnt eat it. So, sometimes when I see food in the fridge I get a surge of anxiety and avoid it like the plague - until it's definitely too late. My roomie had come to me the night before and offered to put things in the compost for me since I was struggling to deal with them, and that morning I had taken them up on it. I had a stack of about 4 medium size tupperwares ready to be dealt with. 

She came into the kitchen and looked at the food. Asked me if that was all getting thrown out and I said yeah. Then she said ""Oh, so it's you! You know 1/4 of food is wasted right?"" and after a second I snapped at her and said ""Don't come into my house and judge me for the shit that I struggle with."" We glared at each other a bit and I left for work with my toast in my mouth. While I was at work, she sent a text that basically said 'fuck you too, I shouldnt have spared your feelings.' I admitted I lashed out and apologized, and she said if I was feeling a way about it I couldve broached that in a more self aware way. 

Basically since then, I tried reaching out over text a few times to find a time to talk. Got one response but it didnt go anywhere. We've even shared space but neither of us broached the subject, and when I did ask in person it wasnt a good time.

The thing is, she's still my roommate's partner and is still around. I find this stuff difficult to set down and keep getting anxious and upset when she's in the house. I tried asking my roommate not to bring her around but that is not a request theyre willing to respect.

110,1e2qv2f,AITA for buying designer items with my own money,"Happily married working at a FAANG (3 years now) with a retired husband - he is 10 years older. Together we have four adult children - 1 together and  3 from his previous marriage. When we married his ex-wife quit her job and took us to court to get her child support increased wanting to attach to my income. We spent $20K to prevent that from happening. So for the first 10 years of our marriage, I was what he used to call his 'cushion' because 45% went to his children and 20% went to his investments. I took care of us and our child's needs. Eventually he decided he wanted to retire early and be a stay at home Dad. I agreed and he retired at 58. We lived frugally off of my income for the last 10 years while saving his pension.

Annually I now earn over $500k and he recently started taking his social security at 100%. Other than our mortgage (owe $280K), we owe roughly $5k in credit cards as we own our cars. At this point our net worth is over $3M. We recently decided to build an addition to our home which we estimate will cost $500k - plan is to pay cash. He desperately wants to be debt free (a bit of a worry wort) so I agreed to pay off the mortgage.

This year, I splurged a little buying designer shoes and handbags. He just found out I sold some of the stocks (part of my compensation) and is PISSED! Like he won't even talk to me or look at me. Why? He thinks and acts like we are poor. He constantly worries about what will happen if he dies, I lose my job, we go to war, we have a recession, etc. The list of what if's goes on and on. His point is we need to save, save, save for a rainy day. Our broker shared given how we are investing we will leave our kids a really huge nest egg. He grew up poor and the idea of generational wealth excites him.

I don't mind leaving money, but I don't want to live a life filled with regret as his mother did. I was raised in an upper middle-class home and like nice things. He was raised in a low-income area and makes me feel guilty/stupid for wanting nice things. For his birthday I purchased him all new clothes and designer shoes. I also purchased new clothes for our daughter. He yelled and said he was going to start buying the things he wants and that I wouldn't be happy. I actually don't care. In my mind you can't take it with you so why not enjoy the fruits of your labor while you are living? I refuse to let my tombstone say if only I had saved more money.

AITA for selling some of my stock to buy things for myself, my husband and my daughter and not honoring our agreement to not spend any money? I spent less than 5% of my income.

111,1e2qtcy,AITA for making a scene when my mom talked about my hair?,"Hey guys! I don't really know how to introduce my story, so I'll do my best to explain.
First, I need to explain why my hair is such a sensitive topic for me. Since I've been growing it, people in public places have been giving me strange looks and whispering, making it a huge insecurity for me. This only got worse when, at a family lunch, my uncle decided to make a ""joke"" (purely racist) about my hair in front of the whole family. I, naive as I am, expected someone to defend me while I was still in shock, from what my own uncle had told me.
On the way home, I talked to my mother about what I should do in this situation, the moment I was most irritated was when she simply defended him in front of me. Honestly, it got so stuck in my head that I thought about just shaving it off since I style my hair Black Power style. 
Also, not long before, when I went to school with my hair styled like that, I had to hear some surprisingly horrible things from other black people. So I wasn't doing very well.
Despite all this, I love my hair. Whenever I can use it the way I want, I do. It's one of the happiest moments when people praise him. For instance, I recently went to my best friend's house to spend the afternoon talking or watching movies, the highlight of our afternoon being when he and his mother complimented my hair.
Now, we get into the main part of the story. Last night, my family and I got together to eat something at night like we always do. However, keep in mind that it had just been washed, so it was smaller and curlier, which is the way my mom prefers it to be (even though I hate it). At that point, she started talking about how this style suited me better and started talking about it with others. At that moment, something snapped and I left the table very angry, because my insecurity when people talked about my hair, especially in front of other people, was no longer unknown to her. I recognize that I may have overreacted, but I don't think it was out of my rights. 
So, AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-14,"AITA for making a scene when my mom talked about my hair? Hey guys! I don't really know how to introduce my story, so I'll do my best to explain.
First, I need to explain why my hair is such a sensitive topic for me. Since I've been growing it, people in public places have been giving me strange looks and whispering, making it a huge insecurity for me. This only got worse when, at a family lunch, my uncle decided to make a ""joke"" (purely racist) about my hair in front of the whole family. I, naive as I am, expected someone to defend me while I was still in shock, from what my own uncle had told me.
On the way home, I talked to my mother about what I should do in this situation, the moment I was most irritated was when she simply defended him in front of me. Honestly, it got so stuck in my head that I thought about just shaving it off since I style my hair Black Power style. 
Also, not long before, when I went to school with my hair styled like that, I had to hear some surprisingly horrible things from other black people. So I wasn't doing very well.
Despite all this, I love my hair. Whenever I can use it the way I want, I do. It's one of the happiest moments when people praise him. For instance, I recently went to my best friend's house to spend the afternoon talking or watching movies, the highlight of our afternoon being when he and his mother complimented my hair.

112,1e2qq9v,AITA for not helping my family clean?,"So I (18FTM) live with my grandparents and my annoying 25M cousin and uncle. (i am an orphan) I am not home most of the time. I keep to myself and take care of my rabbit. I hardly ever use the kitchen, put all my garbage in my own can in my room and always wash my own dishes. My family is the one using the kitchen all the time. I don’t even eat the food they make and cook for myself because I simply don’t like their food. And yet they still ask me to clean their dishes, clean the kitchen counter THEY used, take out the compost that THEY filled themselves, and take out the kitchen garbage that I don’t even use or contribute to. I have told them time and time again I don’t like cleaning up messes that I didn’t make or help make. And what did they do today? Ask me to clean up their mess. And they call me selfish for only cleaning up after myself and not helping them. But I never ask them to help me clean. I don’t even ask for things from the grocery store because I realized they would use that against me. Even when they offer to help me clean my own stuff I refuse because I just prefer doing it my way. I get angry when someone doesn’t it do it right and it’s unfair for me to lash out at others so I do everything by myself. They went on another tangent today about how selfish they think I am and to be honest it was really hurting my feelings when I was already dealing with enough. So I finally snapped back at them and raised my voice at them like they do to me. I said something along the lines of “So I should clean up after the mess YOU made even though I didn’t make it?” And then they said I was the most disgusting person to talk to. I genuinely don’t think I did anything wrong and I don’t see the problem with only cleaning after me and my bun. And if I friends over I clean after them because it’s my responsibility since I’m the one who brought them there. But is there something wrong with that??? Am I really an asshole for this???

113,1e2pyku,AITA for wanting my partner to prioritize hanging out with me even if it means cancelling on his friend group?,"My partner 27M and I 27F have been together for 8 yr. For the last year we have lived 2 hr apart due to new jobs and will not be able to move for the next 3 yr. Both of us are in the same field and work 80-100 hr a week and rarely get both weekend days off making it hard to see each other more than once a month. 

The issue arose when he visited me on my birthday last month and posted pictures of me on his Instagram stories. I realized he had blocked me from his stories because I coudn't see the pictures. When confronted he first insisted it was a mistake then asked if i would stop being mad if he told me why then said it was for a reason that I wouldn't care about

There is a tourist attraction near us that only opens in the summer. Both of us really wanted to go and had been talking about it for months. Turns out his friends were going the previous Saturday and he went with them. He wanted to post a picture but didn't want me to see so blocked me and forgot to unblock. I wasn't working that weekend and had asked to hang out and was told that he had a pool party at a friend's. 

We had a fight. He went from saying you know how much i wanted to go to they don't know you well and it's awkward to this is exactly why I hid the story, because I knew you would get like this to You know I wasn't targeting you, I would've done this to anyone

Last weekend, I got off work early and offered to drive to him. I was going to drive back Sunday morning since he had to work. He insisted that I come next weekend when he had both days off. I was scheduled to work a 24hr shift the next Friday and would be working until 7am Saturday and too tired to drive and would only get to stay one night. But he insisted that next weekend would be better because he needed rest before the Sunday shift. I was mad that it didn't matter that I would be tired from a 24.

Today he asked me to drive to him, I said no because I'm tired and still upset. I asked what plans he had last weekend because of which he didn't want me around. He denied and called me crazy but I told him I knew he was at a work party last Friday. He said I am extroverted, you mistake me wanting to hang out with a big dumb group as ignoring you. I have always said that I don't like them and get sick of them but sometimes I want a large group

I get that extroverts need people but my point is that he goes out with them after work and most weekends when I'm working. I'm not some crazy control freak that keeps him from his friends. I only get to see him a few times a month and I expect to be prioritized over others. In my field, lots of people have to live apart from their SO and everyone I know would prioritize SO. 

My partner says that extroverts sometimes have to be around people and it's not fair for me to villainize that just because I am introverted. I maybe TA because I'm introverted and wouldn't be around people I don't like.
