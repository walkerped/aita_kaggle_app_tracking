0,1e36ih5,UPDATE: AITA for asking my friend to take down her bachelorette party photos?,"I wanted to give it a couple days before I updated to let the situation cool down or hopefully resolve itself. In short, the post got taken down, the wedding is still happening, and I'm still friends with her. 

I got a bunch of dms from her fiance the other day, apologizing, saying that he'd recognized me in the photos of me without my hijab and he'd informed me that he told her to take them down. He's Christian, but from what I understand, his mother veils and he understands the rules around hijab a good bit. He felt bad and I had to reassure him that it wasn't his fault and thanked him for talking to Maya for me. He asked if this whole situation would affect our friendship, and I told him I wasn't sure in what way. 

A bit after, Maya finally messaged me one to one for the first time after the whole fiasco. She apologized and explained she didn't think it was a big deal since her other muslim friend doesn't wear the hijab and she thought I was simply being dramatic. I told her that everyone is different and what someone else chooses to do with their body and faith doesn't mean someone else will do the same. My older sister doesn't wear the hijab, Maya's seen her. It's a personal choice and no two people are going to have the same relationship with it.

I asked her why me asking her to take it down wasn't enough on it's own, since she'd done similar things for others in the past (think bra strap showing, unflattering angle, exposed scars) without hesitation. She said she wasn't thinking straight and felt like it didn't matter in the grand scheme of things. It was only when her fiance brought it up to her that she took it down. She put the other four photos up (the ones without me in them) and she realized that she was being stubborn for no reason. She asked me if there was anything she could do to make up for it and I asked her to just keep it in the past.

I'd like to clear up the notion that this the first bachelorette party or even wedding our friend group has had, since that's far from it. Added, we've had conversations regarding special occasions MANY times so even if it was the first time, this shouldn't have happened. This wedding will be the third and come by September, mine will be the fourth! Also, we've been friends for almost two decades, so cutting her off over this would be so out of proportion. I did not report the photos, and I did not abandon my faith like some of you suggested. This may not be the update some were wanting, but at least things are better now and the wedding is soon and going as planned!

I want to get a short haircut to see how it feels with a more masculine traits, and I also think it would be easier to take care of (im always having to use heat styling or it looks terrible)

My husband said he doesn't like women with short hair and asked me not to cut it. I am wondering if it would be an asshole move to just do it anyway. He has very minimal requests when it comes to my appearance so part of me feels I should just keep it long for him.

2,1e2pokl,AITA For not helping parents fix up the new house,"I just turned 21 years old. My parents and I including siblings (all really young 6-12) are moving out into a better house out of the city. They decided to buy a house that needed about 1-2 months of work. I recently got out of college and finally have some level of independence working full time and can finally enjoy my summer. After I struggled to take care of my finances throughout  my 2 year college (Trade) and had to do deliveries making $200 a week just to cover my gas, I finally graduated and was able to start working full time. There were still tons of things I needed to buy like tools and more clothes because I never bought any, and just whatever I couldn’t afford before. Immediately after I started working full time they started charging me rent which I thought was an asshole move because in my opinion I personally wouldn’t charge my kid rent, or I would at least wait. Initially they wanted to charge me 400 and then brought it out to $300. I wasn’t and still am not making much but it was fine. So I’ve been paying rent for about a year. 

Now they’re getting a house that needed 1-2 months worth of work and they’re basically upset that I haven’t been much interested in helping out and working on the house, painting and making rooms and literally redoing the whole house. I feel like since I am paying them rent even though it’s not much I shouldn’t be forced to go work on a house after I do hard work everyday and come home from work tired the last thing I want to do is go work on a house right after. I’m hungry so that rules out the weekdays pretty much. And I have a girlfriend that I see 1 day out of the weekend and some days of the week. They complain when I go to water parks instead of working at the house.. I have gone occasionally to help, and a few times I’ve driven hours to get things they want off Facebook marketplace for the house. I don’t think I should be forced to go work on this house. Of course I will help move stuff over and I have already and will when it’s time to move in. They will never get my side. My dad doesn’t pressure me to work there only my mom. AITA? Sorry for length 

Edit: Another thing is today I was supposed to help take some stuff over, I was in my room waiting for them to call me when they were going to start. Apparently it got canceled and my mother is mad at me because I didn’t ask, just waited. I told her that if I needed a friends help and I didn’t need it anymore I would tell them… not just stay quiet and have them guessing.

5,1e2p6wx,AITA for not sharing my cookies with my Dad?,"
Ik the title sounds ridiculous but let me explain:

Before I begin with the story I need to give you some context about my dad: 
I love him with all of my heart, but I gotta say that he can be incredibly exhausting. He has the habit of making a scene out of every little thing and causing arguments sometimes on purpose. He also has a habit of not accepting my boundaries, and gets really angry when I establish them.
So now to the story: 

I (19) am currently in NYC with my family for a trip. Sadly I got sick yesterday and stayed home today. My parents bought me some Chips and cookies from the store.

Like 10 minutes ago, my dad comes in and asks if he can have 1 of the cookies, and I said no because I have only a few left, but he can have some Chips or other stuff that I have in my room. 
When I tell you he got pissed, that would be an understatement. He got incredibly angry, told me how rude I always am and how I never share (which is NOT true)how egoistical I am and how he always treats me so nice and Im so ungrateful. I then, taken aback, told him that he should just accept my no but he can have the other snacks that I had.
He then said that apparently he OWNS the cookies cause he bought them, and told me again how ungrateful I am and how I have such ""evil"" personality traits, and that he will never again ask me for anything.
The whole time I stayed calm and composed, I wasnt angry or anything cause I knew if I raised my voice then this 'argument' would further escalate. Hes now moping in the other room I think and Im scared of coming out of my bedroom lol because I fear the argument will then start again.

The thing is I know that Im not in the wrong here (atleast I hope so lol) but I still have a voice in the back of my head that tells my that my dad is in the right, and I shouldve just given him the cookie. But its also so exhausting to not have my boundaries accepted and to listen to his rants on how of a bad person I am, he always does this and I noticed that definitely affected on how I think of myself. 
I feel that no matter how much I try to explain to him how that makes my feel and how stressful it is, he never betters himself. Or maybe he is right about me idk

Also sorry for any grammar or spelling errors, Im not a native speaker.

7,1e2oxeu,AITA for wanting my husband to work less?,"My husband and I have been married for 5 years. Before that we had 5 years of long distance relationship. Back then all we dreamed about was to be in the same country. And once it became reality we were very happy. We had a baby, she’s 5yo now. And I had horrible postpartum depression. For her first two years it felt like I was alone in it while he was working, he was only provider and I think it was hard on him. I found myself help, medication and thanks for my husband’s financial help, I was able to do therapy for a few years. That helped a lot with any arguments we had, I changed and changed the way I communicate with him. I completely stopped nagging him or arguing with him thankfully because I realized my perspective was wrong. 
All was okay until my husband found a job with a maniac boss who does nothing but work. And my husband admires that. So he’s been working already long hours (50-55 hrs per week) but he also stays longer whenever anything goes wrong. The other day he came home after 6am while his shift ended at 1am. We talked and he seemed to understand but today again he’s staying extra 4 hours because someone was fired. A week before he had to go in on his day off. I can never rely on him really in terms of childcare. Thankfully, I work remotely and in spans of 2-3 hours so I’m always managing on my own. But it’s very exhausting and depressing. We have no holidays, vacations and barely any time we do anything nice together. I feel lonely, tired and helpless. I love my husband so much but thought the other day that if we divorced at least I would get some days for myself because he’d be legally forced to take our daughter. 
In addition to all this, I always doubt myself if I have a reason to be mad or not. I can’t tell if I’m being selfish and need to take care of my own happiness. Or if it’s a legitimate complaint. I don’t know what to do. We lost insurance when he picked this job so counseling would probably be too expensive. And I’m not sure how it can help us. He tells me he doesn’t want to work such long hours but I see how he can never say no to his job. He always says “it’s in my job description”.

8,1e2onpb,AITA for yelling for yelling at my martial arts instructor after he talked trash about my wife?,"This is a story about and a friend of mine, who I shall refer to as “LP”. LP and I trained at the same martial arts school for several years. When our instructor retired and moved out of state, LP decided to start a club so we could keep training on a more informal basis. Since we were both black belts, I decided to join the club so that I could keep training and help LP with teaching.  
  
LP is a joker and likes to tease people, but at the same time, he is kind of sensitive about people who he feels that are being disrespectful to him. (Not a good combination, I know.). LP had teased me about stuff before, but he never seemed to get the hint when I told him to stop.  
  
The triggering event occurred when one of our students came to class and announced that his wife had just had a baby. While the rest of us were congratulating him, LP started teasing him about how he should be at home helping with the baby and that his wife was going to hold it against him for coming to class.  
  
I thought that was very disrespectful, so I told LP that not all women are like that. In fact, that evening happened to be my wife’s birthday, but she was working late so she told me to go to class and we would celebrate on another night.  
  
LP turns his attention to me and says that no matter what my wife says, she’s going to secretly hold this against me. Basically, his ex-wife had done this to him and now he was claiming that all wives were going to act just like his ex. I told him to knock it off, rather forcefully.  
  
Instead of stopping, LP launches into a tirade about how I’m not allowed to get angry at him, how dangerous it was for me to let my emotions get the better of me, and how I needed to be more respectful.

The rest of the class was mostly normal, but I was still annoyed. After class, I told LP that I didn’t appreciate that he talked trash about my wife in front of the entire class. Instead of apologizing, he doubled down on the things he had said before and added that I needed to learn better self-control and that he was going to test me until I could keep my emotions in check.

After we had cooled off for a couple of weeks, I sat down with LP to try to clear the air. He insisted that he had done nothing wrong. His defense of his actions fell into two camps:

1)      It was okay for him to tease me because he was just making a joke and that’s just the way his is.

2)      Even if I didn’t like what he was saying, I needed to be more respectful because the other students would lose respect for him otherwise.

I understand the protocol of treating the martial arts instructor with respect, but it seems to me that LP was expecting a double standard: He could be the class clown, but I had to treat him with respect.

In retrospect, we both could have handled this better and we’re both stubborn, but it’s still putting a strain on our relationship.

LP turns his attention to me and says that no matter what my wife says, she’s going to secretly hold this against me. Basically, his ex-wife had done this to him and now he was claiming that all wives were going to act just like his ex. I told him to knock it off, rather forcefully.  
  
Instead of stopping, LP launches into a tirade about how I’m not allowed to get angry at him, how dangerous it was for me to let my emotions get the better of me, and how I needed to be more respectful.

The rest of the class was mostly normal, but I was still annoyed. After class, I told LP that I didn’t appreciate that he talked trash about my wife in front of the entire class. Instead of apologizing, he doubled down on the things he had said before and added that I needed to learn better self-control and that he was going to test me until I could keep my emotions in check.

After we had cooled off for a couple of weeks, I sat down with LP to try to clear the air. He insisted that he had done nothing wrong. His defense of his actions fell into two camps:

1)      It was okay for him to tease me because he was just making a joke and that’s just the way his is.

2)      Even if I didn’t like what he was saying, I needed to be more respectful because the other students would lose respect for him otherwise.

I understand the protocol of treating the martial arts instructor with respect, but it seems to me that LP was expecting a double standard: He could be the class clown, but I had to treat him with respect.

In retrospect, we both could have handled this better and we’re both stubborn, but it’s still putting a strain on our relationship.
