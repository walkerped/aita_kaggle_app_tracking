Well Douche used to bully me back in middle school (we are in our second year of highschool so 2 or 3 years ago)Im a trans guy and most of my friends are gay and Douche used to be rude to us, call us names, and genuinely bully us so I dont like him. Today me and my friends along with Douche went to F1's birthday get together thing. During this I try to stay away from Douche but we end up interacting and he keeps giving me and my friends looks so I end up saying some things. (F1 and Douche break up and get together a lot) so my other friend suggest on the first day of school before our classes start we visit our favorite teachers and F1 brings up the fact she always walks with Douche so I say ""Who knows if youll last that long"" of course another of my friend says that was uncalled for but I think nothing of it. After I get home F1 messages our gc telling us that Douche told her mom that we were bullying him. In response to this one of my friends asks what my problem with Douche is and I tell them. They tell me that it would be best if I got over it. I feel like i may be the AH because I may have been out of pocket and rude.

1,1e3hzk3,AITA (13M) for excluding my (13F) twin sister from my friend group hangouts and activites?,"(This is a throwaway account because she lives on reddit and follows my main) 

Here is some background, before the 2023-2024 school year, me and my sister were closer than ever and we never excluded each other from anything. Our mother informed us of being sent to a new public school that was predominantly white and we had no acquaintances that were there. As the year started, I quickly raised to popularity among the people in my grade and soon in the school. But, my sister was an introvert and refused to talk to new people so she had a small friend group with three people who all shared similar interest. I met very cool people who outdid any thing my old friends had every done for me and my life was changed for the better over the course of 9 months. The problem comes in as the summer started. I've settled with a pretty well put together friend group of 6 people. We always plan to go places and my mom encourages me to bring my sister to tag along. But everyone in the group of friends thinks she's annoying or talks too much (and I agree with them). She has lots of friends too she just doesn't like to ask them to hang out. My mom always talks to me about putting her over them and while I would love to in the previous year, she took my friends any time I would start talking to them and then force them to cut me off. While I feel split in my decision, with that leading factor I feel like it is already made but I want to hear the reddit communities opinion on my problem. So, Am I the Asshole.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-15,"AITA (13M) for excluding my (13F) twin sister from my friend group hangouts and activites?

2,1e3hg0s,AITA because I can't give my boyfriend attention constantly ,"I, well we really have a 8 week old baby and anyone who has kids knows, they're needy. My boyfriend has another kid but when she was a baby, was never around due to work. so he never knew how newborns are needy and don't like being put down etc etc. He's told me he wants more attention and that if the baby is crying, to not pick it up as it teaches them to be needy. He told me the baby gets all my attention and he never gets any (once the baby goes to bed, I try sit on the couch and cuddle my boyfriend or ask what he wants to do with me etc) but everytime I get a chance to give him attention he just sits on his playstation and doesn't want to do anything else.

3,1e3gvsd,WIBTA if I stand up to my overbearing older brother?,"To begin, me and my older brother have an eight year gap between us, he's an adult, while I'm moving into my college this year.

  Ever since I was young, my brother has tried to parent me instead of acting like an actual sibling. And with how he speaks about philosophy, how he dropped out of high-school, how he has full access to the internet, he believes he knows all. All he care about is being right or wrong, and will always ruin my day. 

  To get to the story - I had a good day, I went to my friends house, I then went to the mall and did some fun activities. My parents come to pick me up, and he's angry already, I don't know why, and he suddenly starts cursing at me. And when I of course make a confused face, he says that he dares me to speak. I of course won't, he's done this many times and I'm to scared to really test him honestly. 

 So, WIBTA if I try to stand up to him? If I try to call him out on his behavior, I have before and I've been shut down. Further context can be provided if needed.
