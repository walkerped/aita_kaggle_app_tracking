1,1e3hzk3,AITA (13M) for excluding my (13F) twin sister from my friend group hangouts and activites?,"(This is a throwaway account because she lives on reddit and follows my main) 

Here is some background, before the 2023-2024 school year, me and my sister were closer than ever and we never excluded each other from anything. Our mother informed us of being sent to a new public school that was predominantly white and we had no acquaintances that were there. As the year started, I quickly raised to popularity among the people in my grade and soon in the school. But, my sister was an introvert and refused to talk to new people so she had a small friend group with three people who all shared similar interest. I met very cool people who outdid any thing my old friends had every done for me and my life was changed for the better over the course of 9 months. The problem comes in as the summer started. I've settled with a pretty well put together friend group of 6 people. We always plan to go places and my mom encourages me to bring my sister to tag along. But everyone in the group of friends thinks she's annoying or talks too much (and I agree with them). She has lots of friends too she just doesn't like to ask them to hang out. My mom always talks to me about putting her over them and while I would love to in the previous year, she took my friends any time I would start talking to them and then force them to cut me off. While I feel split in my decision, with that leading factor I feel like it is already made but I want to hear the reddit communities opinion on my problem.

4,1e4a566,AITA for canceling a hike my LD friend was looking forward to?,"Backstory: I (27f) live in a very small town in NV. I don’t have a job so my free time consists of exploring the area around the town, NEET’ing at home and talking to random people online.

Last spring I connected with a girl (23f) who’s from the UK. We talked a lot and soon became friends.

A few months back she said she was planning a trip to the US and wanted to visit my state too. I was very thrilled to meet her IRL so I invited her over. She knew my town doesn’t have many tourist attractions, but she was really thrilled about going on a hike in the mountains.

Fast forward to now, she came over, and it’s a heatwave in my area atm. So I explained to her that we couldn’t go on a hike during the daytime because of how hot it gets. I offered her to go at night, but she was understandably skittish about the whole idea, and she kept insisting we’d still go during the day.

Now it’s where I might be an AH. I told her that I’m not going anywhere during the day until the heatwave is over. She said she could still manage it since her clothes (hijab and abaya) were covering her body and protecting her from the heat and that she could lend me some of her clothes. She also said that her ancestors wore it in the desert all the time back in the day. I told her straightforwardly that she grew up in Birmingham, that her body is used to colder climates and that in her synthetic silk clothing she would literally overheat and pass away (which is precisely what happened last week to some other tourist in another county), and even me, who grew up in NV and whose favorite pastime is indeed hiking for miles straight under the scorching sun wouldn’t risk getting out during the heatwave.

We had a fight and she said I’m an asshole and I underestimated her and that it’s not how she pictured her trip to the US. I offered her to go to the Lake Tahoe instead, but she said it would be boring and that it’s too much of a drive.

Now I feel like an asshole because she really wanted to go on that hike. My dad said it was asinine of her to try and persuade me into risking our lives.

7,1e49bdy,AITA for refusing to drive my fiancée to the train station after he missed his bus,"My (24F) fiancée (25M) has ADHD and has a difficult keeping a schedule which often results in him sleeping past his alarm. Today he was supposed to catch the bus at 7:30am but missed it.

I work shiftwork and had just finished my third 12 hour night shift in a row. My commute home is about 45 mins, so I got home just before 8:00am, and woke up my fiancée upon entry. He was upset with himself right away as he usually is when he sleeps in. 

We’ve had this issue in the past and I’ve previously told him that if he really needed a ride to the train station, I would prefer to pick him up at the front door (we live in an apartment) because once I’m parked in the garage and make it upstairs I’m tired and prefer not to leave again at this point (which I’ve still done in the past for him). I would say I probably drive him at least once every 2 weeks when he’s late.

He asked me if I’d drive him to the train station today, which would save him a 30 minute walk for his already long 1.5hr commute, but I declined. I was hesitant at first, but decided that I deserve to put myself first. He seemed upset, and did make a comment saying “I better see you in bed in 2 minutes then”, but eventually went on his way. Approx 30 mins later, he texted me saying that he knows it wasn’t good timing but that he really could’ve used the drive today. 

Later today he called and I expressed to him how I was upset by this. He said he was also upset because I wasn’t there for him when he needed me and that he would’ve done it for me if the roles were reversed, and that he was scared there was a limit to how much he could lean on me. Also that he hopes I’m happy that I got what I wanted and for me to enjoy my extra 30 mins of sleep.

To be fair, I’m not working today, so I’m able to sleep in later and it would’ve only taken me about 30 mins in total. I feel a bit guilty as realistically it wouldn’t have been that much of a burden to drive him and it means it would help him out a lot.

9,1e493yk,AITA for asking my sister to reimburse me for my glasses that my nephew broke?,"I (29F) have a nephew (5m) with autism. His diagnosis helped me to realize that I have it too. He's a good kid for the most part but does have his moments of ill behavior. For instance, if I leave my door open, he will go in and mess with my stuff. This isn't the first time he's messed with my glasses. On Sunday night, my dad was doing some cable work in my room and I left to give him some more space so I went in the living room. I hear my dad telling my nephew to take off my glasses and in trying to take them from him, my nephew jumps on my bed, starts rolling around and bent one of the handles really badly. I yelled at him and his dad asked what happened. I told him what happened and he took him over their shared room. No apology, no sorry about that, nothing but he was upset with him. I told my sis (41F) about it and she was upset with him too and didn't really let him out of the room much that night.

I go to the eye doctor to see if they can repair the glasses. They were almost 4 years old so the warranty on them was gone. I didn't realize I had them that long. They couldn't fix the handle without it breaking completely and to swap the lens into a new pair of glasses sounds like more hassle so I just decided to get a new pair. The last time I went to the eye doctor, they told me I could upgrade my prescription so I just got a new pair. Honestly, my current pair was fine but the new prescription makes things better.

Anyway I get home and told my sister that I had to get a new pair which was over $500 and I'll have to use my backup pair in the meantime since they won't be ready for another week. She kind of answered me nonchalantly about it and my BIL didn't say anything about it. I just think that if your kid broke something of mine that I use on a daily basis, you should at least give me something towards it.

This is the part where I think I might be an AH. These glasses were already old and the new prescription is a lot better so should I really ask them to reimburse me since the glasses needed to be replaced anyway?

Update: Thanks to all who replied. My sis sent me $250. That’s a reasonable amount. Thought she’d give me less honestly. Also another thing for clairty, i see my eye doctor every 6 months mostly to test my pressure(high eye pressure runs in the family but in february i saw a different doc since my usual one was busy that day. Did the same pressure and field vision but there was a slight change in vision and she said i could upgrade the prescription if i wanted to. At the time i dind't think i needed to since I could see fine out of my regular glasses. She always asks me if I can see fine out of them and I tell her yes. And i didn't expect my sis to give me $500 upfront either. I expected at least $100",Not the A-hole,2024-07-15,"AITA for asking my sister to reimburse me for my glasses that my nephew broke? I (29F) have a nephew (5m) with autism. His diagnosis helped me to realize that I have it too. He's a good kid for the most part but does have his moments of ill behavior. For instance, if I leave my door open, he will go in and mess with my stuff. This isn't the first time he's messed with my glasses. On Sunday night, my dad was doing some cable work in my room and I left to give him some more space so I went in the living room. I hear my dad telling my nephew to take off my glasses and in trying to take them from him, my nephew jumps on my bed, starts rolling around and bent one of the handles really badly. I yelled at him and his dad asked what happened. I told him what happened and he took him over their shared room. No apology, no sorry about that, nothing but he was upset with him. I told my sis (41F) about it and she was upset with him too and didn't really let him out of the room much that night.

I go to the eye doctor to see if they can repair the glasses. They were almost 4 years old so the warranty on them was gone. I didn't realize I had them that long. They couldn't fix the handle without it breaking completely and to swap the lens into a new pair of glasses sounds like more hassle so I just decided to get a new pair. The last time I went to the eye doctor, they told me I could upgrade my prescription so I just got a new pair. Honestly, my current pair was fine but the new prescription makes things better.

Anyway I get home and told my sister that I had to get a new pair which was over $500 and I'll have to use my backup pair in the meantime since they won't be ready for another week. She kind of answered me nonchalantly about it and my BIL didn't say anything about it. I just think that if your kid broke something of mine that I use on a daily basis, you should at least give me something towards it.

Not only was she a no show but she also ignored my texts leading up to the event. I have a feeling she didn’t show because of another family member that was attending but admittedly I was upset.

12,1e48e0y,AITA for asking my boyfriend if he even knows me at all after he didn’t get me a coffee. ,"Me (27f) and my boyfriend (27m) have been dating for over 7 years. This morning we both had the day off and he was going to the gas station to get breakfast. We do this very often and I always get the same thing, a sandwich and a coffee. Ever since he has known me, I have always drank a coffee in the morning. Anyways, he usually doesn’t even ask me what I want, he just gets it. But before he left, he asked me “what do you want for breakfast?” and I said “a coffee and a sandwich” like always and added in a honey bun. 

When he came back, he gave me my sandwich and honey bun and i figure he put my coffee in the fridge as he does stuff like that a lot and I was still in bed. When I got up i didn’t see my coffee so I said “where’s my coffee” and he immediately said “you didn’t ask for one.” this instantly annoyed me as he had an attitude about it and i did ask for one. I said “yes i did” and he says he didn’t hear me and I say, “that’s so annoying, now I have no coffee” and walked away. He asked if it was a big deal and I said no, I can just get another coffee but it’s fucking annoying. He didn’t reply and I asked him if he even knew me bc that’s wild that he would think i didn’t want a coffee regardless if I say it or not and this pissed him off. he left and went to sit in his car. 

I went to get my coffee and by the time I got back he was angry cleaning. He has this thing where he thinks i’m attacking him for things all the time and then shuts down so I was trying to explain why I said what I said and had a panic attack bc I was  overwhelmed and the shutting down is a trigger for me. I took a break and came back and explained myself and it seemed to calm him down and he said he felt attacked in the moment but he understood now. 

That was at 11 am and now it’s 6:30 and he’s barely talked to me. He went to take a nap at 2 after cleaning and hasn’t gotten up. I got over it hours ago and have been doing my thing but now i’m getting annoyed again. I feel I am not wrong in this situation. I could have been more calm for sure but i’m working on that. Am I the asshole?? what do i do?

EDIT: I appreciate a few of you who called me out for being the asshole without being an asshole yourself, thank you for your perspective. I can agree that I am the asshole for overreacting by using the word fucking and saying “do you even know me.” When I said it I didn’t mean it to be that deep. I just meant it in a way that it was weird he didn’t get me a coffee since I drink one every day and he DOES know me so why wouldn’t he get me one? I had gotten no sleep and was not in a good mood and his response just got me and I should have just thanked him and walked away as many have you have pointed out. 

For those wondering, I apologized when I came back from getting the coffee when he told me how he felt and gave him space because that’s what he needs after any conflict. He cleaned and took a nap. He doesn’t take naps so I knew he was just laying there thinking for most of the time. I wasn’t trying to say I was annoyed that he was angry. I was annoyed because he holds on to his anger but acts like he’s not actually mad. Like when he was “napping” went to check on him and he was awake and told me we were all good but still didn’t talk to me. I never shared my annoyance with him about his rumination or shamed him for it. I kept it to myself and I don’t. think i’m wrong for feeling that way. He has his emotions and I have mine, I know it’s not really fair to him to feel annoyed by that which is why i wrote this on reddit. I just wanted to hear other perspectives. 

And for the panic attack, that had nothing to do with anything besides him throwing throngs around the kitchen while cleaning. It’s a trigger for me and I went to the bathroom alone when it happened. He was not present for it. I can’t control it when it happens. i’m working on it. 

Anyways I apologized again over an hour ago as soon as I got home but this time for my overreaction of saying “i’m fucking annoyed.” he said it was NO BIG DEAL and apologized for being short with me in the morning and for him shutting me out. We hugged it out, we love each other and occasionally have dumb arguments. Before anyone says anything, once again I never said anything to home about his reaction, he just knows he tends to hold on to his anger and he did give me attitude this morning when i asked about my coffee. 

I know I was wrong and I am going to continue to work on my communication skills but so is he bc he’s not this perfect little angel either 😭

14,1e487ta,AITA For telling my mother I don’t believe in god?,"AITA For telling my mother I don’t believe in god?
This took place 2 years ago. First of all I want to make it clear that I'm not against religion, I simply don't believe in it and warning this is pretty long. I grew up in a pretty religious family, however my mom was a single parent so she never had the time to teach me about it when I was younger. When I got older and she remarried she finally started with my religious education.

She started sending me to a religion school every Sunday when i started middle school and i absolutely despised it. At that point i had already made up my mind, i simply didn't believe in God, paradise, hell etc... But I never had the courage to tell my mom. I was and still am a people pleaser and I'm afraid of being disliked especially by my family.

So when I started this school I would do everything possible to miss it as much as possible, faking sickness, extending my period and lying about having a test the next day. This went on for two years. At this school they would teach religious studies and the language the religion was written in. And at that time I was already learning two other languages in middle school. I also had to start praying and needed to memorise new text every week. My dislike for this school went to full on hatred for anything religious related. I would carefully avoid anything religion related with my family and try to stay at school for as long as possible.

One day when mom asked why I wanted a talk with the councillor, she asked me why i couldn't I just talk to her. After a long back and forth it ended with me locked in the bathroom while my mother was on the other side trying to convince me to tell her what's wrong. At some point I felt that I could actually tell her without her hating me. So I told her I didn't believe in god.

My mother started sobbing uncontrollably, saying she was a bad mother and that she was going to hell. I left the bathroom and started to confront her, I do love my mother. But then she said she was going to raise me better now.

When I told my mother I didn't believe in god her reaction was to buy me books, have regularly talks with me and get me religious tutors. She wanted to make me believe in God despite me telling her I didn't.

For the rest of the year my mental health was shit. I tried to talk to my family to a minimum and at some point I started to have horrible thoughts.
So when i tried to call one of those helplines the only thing i managed to say was <my mother won't let me be an atheist> before the woman on the other end said I was overreacting and hung up on me. I never told anyone what happened out of shame.

That was a few years ago, I'm doing better now, my mother is ignoring what happened that day and doesn't bring up religion around me and i don't attend the school anymore. However some times I still feel horrible when someone mentions something religious. I know I shouldn't but I can't help it. I wonder if i really am exaggerating.

15,1e4864p,AITA for asking my friends to share the cost of a rental car for our group vacation?,"My friends and I, a group of 15 people, are planning a trip together and have rented a house for our stay. Since only one of us actually owns a car, we’ve all been scrambling for weeks to find enough vehicles to get us to our destination and to use while we’re there (as there’s no public transport available).

After a lot of effort, we managed to secure another car, but that still left five of us without a ride. Eventually, we found a rental car that would cost around $350 for the trip. To keep things fair and because we’re traveling as a group, we suggested in our group chat that we split the rental cost among everyone. This would come to about $25 per person.

We proposed that those who are already providing their own cars wouldn’t have to contribute and that anybody who wanted to contribute could also pay a smaller share and whatever they felt comfortable with. When we put it to a vote, the first group of five with a car immediately agreed to pay the full $25 each, saying it was no problem and we should all share the burden since we’re traveling as a group. They also pointed out that the car assignments had been random and it could have been anyone who ended up needing the rental.

After some silence, the driver from the second group of five said they wouldn’t be paying anything because “we’re already taking a bigger risk by using our own car and insurance and have spent a lot of time securing it. Plus, we’re responsible if anything happens. Otherwise, everyone could have just rented a car instead of using a parent’s car.”

For context, everyone in the group is well-off, especially the five who are refusing to pay. Still, this response has caused quite a bit of unrest in the group. The first group of five is particularly upset, feeling that the second group’s refusal shows a lack of solidarity. Despite being transparent and open about the financial handling of the situation, I’m honestly surprised at how quickly the second group rejected the idea of contributing anything at all, especially because they don’t have any financial constraints.

Now the group is pretty divided, and there’s tension all around. So, AITA for asking my friends to chip in for the rental car?",0.0,1.0012736320495605,1,0

18,1e47yra,AITA for yelling at my dad for trying to find a positive after my friend died suddenly in her sleep. ,"My (25) friend I’ve known for 11 years but turned into an online friendship due to distance tragically and suddenly died in her sleep 2 weeks ago. 

She was 25, left behind 3 children, one who is under a year old. Her partner was meant to be proposing last week. 

She was one of the most amazing mothers I’ve ever met, she inspired me to want to be a mother. She was funny, loving and kind. 

I had no idea this had happened as no one had access to her Instagram and I don’t use Facebook. I actually saw this on the news at 1 am today. No funeral as autopsy is being done. I feel fucked. I’m devastated for her family. 

I told my parents as it’s now 8am and I just couldn’t sleep im restless and wanted to visit my mum. 

My father starts questioning me when I was telling my mum about what type of person my friend was 

 “well you’d hope she’d be a mother wouldn’t you?”

“Hmmm why is it on the news seems weird”

“So weird to go goth at your age” 

Just im standing there justifying things about my DEAD friend who’s kids are grieving who’s partner is grieving who has little siblings who are grieving who’s parents are grieving and I could feel the anger in me building. (Me justifying myself is a pattern)

He starts going on about how there’s a silver lining to appreciate your family. 

I said “I don’t really want to hear that, she’s dead, she’s 25 and dead and her partner woke up to her dead and her kids don’t have a mother, I just don’t really agree please”

He then in an agitated and condescending tone REPEATED what he’d just said, then added on “you’d think this type of thing would make you give a shit but clearly you don’t”  Which is where I lost it and might be the asshole. 

I brought up how when his mother died he milked it for the last 2 years and everyone tiptoed around him and cared for him and was compassionate but he can’t even respect a boundary the same day I find out. And then I finished it by yelling that he was a cunt. 

I left and he followed me outside trying to fight but I just kept kept calling him a loser until I got in my car and left. 

My parents are blowing up my phone and my mum is very angry I didn’t stay to “teach him why what he said is wrong” I said he’s a grown man and it’s not my job and he knows how to act with anyone else.

Pissed everyone off and im being called an asshole.

19,1e47r5k,AITA for leaving the dry wedding wedding early to go to go out.,"So 2 weeks ago I 35f went to a wedding in our college town for a member of our college friend group.  My husband and I left the kids with my parents and we went.  We got a Vrbo with another couple I went to college with for a few days.  My husband and I don’t have a ton of time to ourselves away from the kids so we were excited to let loose.

 On the invitation it said the wedding went to 11 with an after party with the bride and groom at the venue.  The venue was a gorgeous mansion and the bride and groom had it for the night, they were leaving for the honeymoon the next morning.  

Cut to wedding day and it’s a dry wedding.  Apparently the groom is 2 years sober.  No one told us this and we were admittedly bummed.  When we found out there was no alcohol we told people we were going to some bars after and not going to the after party.  We left the wedding at 9:30 because we were itching to go out and the wedding was boring.  

Pretty much the whole college crew left around that time and went out.  Apparently, the bride's friend group did not stay for the party, the grooms did and the optics were very lopsided at the party.  We all heard from the bride about this and she called us assholes for leaving.  She said that she didn't feel supported and felt like we were spiteing her now husband for his sobriety.  I told her that she was reading too much into  it.  We just wanted to go out.  She is especially mad at me as i'm looked at as the ringleader of this outing.  I don't think i've done anything wrong AITA?

21,1e47jvi,AITA for leaving a family reunion early because of my cousin’s unannounced pet?,"My husband’s (28m) family has some annual reunions, and this year it was hosted at his aunt's large, rural property. Everyone was excited because it's a big event where we all catch up, play games, and enjoy each other’s company. One of the cousins, recently got a dog, which she adores and brings everywhere. However, no one mentioned that there would be a dog coming to the reunion.

Here’s the thing: I have a severe dog allergy. When I arrived at the reunion and saw the dog running around, I started feeling anxious. I approached her and gently reminded her about my allergy, hoping she would understand and maybe keep the dog in a separate area. Instead, she got defensive because she didn’t remember I had an allergy. But then, she told me she would keep the dog away.

This obviously, didn’t happen. The dog was running around. I tried to participate in the activities, but within an hour, I was already sneezing and my eyes were itching terribly. I couldn’t take it anymore and told my husband I had to leave. He was sympathetic but suggested I should try to stick it out. When I insisted on leaving, some of his family members overheard and gave me a hard time for ""overreacting"" and ""ruining the fun.""

I drove back home feeling frustrated and left out. I left my husband there and a family member would drive him home. Later, I received a series of texts from his aunt accusing me of being dramatic and saying that my departure made everyone uncomfortable. Some other family members echoed her sentiments, saying I should have just taken allergy medicine and stayed.

My husband was also frustrated because he felt caught in the middle. He wasn't supportive of my decision to leave early and made it clear that he was disappointed. He thought I should have tried harder to manage my allergies and stay for the sake of family unity. His lack of understanding added to my stress and made me feel even more isolated.

However, a few of his family members, understood my situation and said I did the right thing by prioritizing my health.

22,1e47hy7,"AITA that I'm not a good girlfriend in this 4 month arranged relationship, despite not ever being in a romantic relationship in my life?","For context, I (F22) come from an Asian household. Both of my parents are from India, while I was born in the US. I grew up in the States, and growing up in this household, I was encouraged not to date and not to have male friends. Outside of my brothers friends, who I considered my brothers, I didn't have much serious contact with guys.

As time passed, the idea of dating or getting in a relationship became more and more daunting. I didn't know what I was doing, and I didn't know where to start. Eventually, I told my mom that I didn't mind going through an arranged marriage. Just three months ago, while my mom was looking for a match for my brother, my mom found the profile of Ved (fake name, M27). He was from India, had finished his M.B.B.S., and was a working doctor before moving to Boston with his mom and his sister to get his Master in Public Health. We started talking, and it was going fine. I made it clear to everyone that I didn't know how to date, that I was young, and that I wouldn't say yes to anything other than just talking and dating for a while.

My mom loves him, and has made it very clear to me that if I said yes, she would be ecstatic. My dad wants what I want. My brother thinks I am an idiot for going through this and that I should finish college and get a stable job before I even consider all of this.

Ved himself is amazing, he's sweet, he's funny, and he made it completely clear that he wants me to be happy, and he's willing to do anything to keep me happy. He gets interested in what I am interested in, has bought me things, and romances me whenever he can. In June, he came to my house (where I live with my parents) to meet me and my family (sans my brother, who doesn't live in our State anymore) This was our 2nd month of talking. I took him to a theme park we both enjoy, and he took me to a fancy dinner where he called the restaurant to give me a huge bouquet of roses. Soon after this trip, he claimed to everyone in his family that he wanted to marry me. He has already said he loves me.

The part that makes me feel like an asshole is this: I have no idea what I am doing. He wants me to call him every day, and I try, but sometimes I miss the call, and he gets disappointed. He tells me what he is doing every single thing he does throughout the day, and when I don't, he gets disappointed.

23,1e47go5,AITA for sitting at the tip of a girls lap for a minute while out partying with the boys,"For context, I was at a party at a cabin with some guy friends of mine the other weekend. They all know my girlfriend from elementary school, one of them is also her cousin. I've always said I have nothing to hide from her, and I hoped me going with these guys would resemble that fact. Some of the guys brought a couple of girls along, I believe we were 13 guys and 4 girls in total.
We drank plenty that night and honestly I had a lot of fun.
However, I've realized I made a stupid decision that night.. while there wasn't any ill intention from my end, what I did was perceived differently by others.

One of the girls were hooking up with one of the guys that night, they had had sex in one of the rooms a couple of times. While this was going on, the rest of us were outside having a good time. A couple of hours in, we decided to make a bonfire and sit in chairs around it. The girl that hooked up with the guy inside finally decided to come out of the cabin and grabbed a seat just in time for the bonfire. Unluckely for me I didn't grab a chair in time and I ended up standing around the bonfire like a loner while everyone else was sitting. Then it happened. The girl that was hooking up with the guy, asked me if I wanted to sit on the tip of her lap in order to have somewhere to sit. I said yes to this right away, I honestly just wanted somewhere to sit, so I sat down on her lap and sat there for a good minute before I decided it wasn't comfortable, so I stood up and sat down on the ground instead.

While all of this had happened, one of the guys texted my gf what I was doing and so did her cousin. Now my girlfriend thinks I had ill intentions and that I tried cheating on her. Now, I've tried explaining the context of all of this to my girlfriend plenty of times, but she feels embarrassed that multiple people texted her about this and that ""I don't see where I went wrong doing this"". After the fact I can understand how it looks like and honestly I've realized I've gotten myself into a bit of a mess due to a thing I did that only lasted for about a minute. I guess I didn't think too much about it at the time, I guess I thought sitting on the tip of her lap (by the knee) was alright since she had slept with one of the guys there, and I myself knew I wasn't trying to do any shady business.

Excuse my poor English, English isn't my first language. Hope all of this made sense.",Asshole,2024-07-15,"AITA for sitting at the tip of a girls lap for a minute while out partying with the boys For context, I was at a party at a cabin with some guy friends of mine the other weekend. They all know my girlfriend from elementary school, one of them is also her cousin. I've always said I have nothing to hide from her, and I hoped me going with these guys would resemble that fact. Some of the guys brought a couple of girls along, I believe we were 13 guys and 4 girls in total.
We drank plenty that night and honestly I had a lot of fun.
However, I've realized I made a stupid decision that night.. while there wasn't any ill intention from my end, what I did was perceived differently by others.

One of the girls were hooking up with one of the guys that night, they had had sex in one of the rooms a couple of times. While this was going on, the rest of us were outside having a good time. A couple of hours in, we decided to make a bonfire and sit in chairs around it. The girl that hooked up with the guy inside finally decided to come out of the cabin and grabbed a seat just in time for the bonfire. Unluckely for me I didn't grab a chair in time and I ended up standing around the bonfire like a loner while everyone else was sitting. Then it happened. The girl that was hooking up with the guy, asked me if I wanted to sit on the tip of her lap in order to have somewhere to sit. I said yes to this right away, I honestly just wanted somewhere to sit, so I sat down on her lap and sat there for a good minute before I decided it wasn't comfortable, so I stood up and sat down on the ground instead.

While all of this had happened, one of the guys texted my gf what I was doing and so did her cousin. Now my girlfriend thinks I had ill intentions and that I tried cheating on her.

24,1e47d3v,AITA I think I went too hard on someone…,"I have a guy I know, we used to be friends but I’ve seen him 5 times in 15 years, wasn’t invited to his wedding. That level. Anyway.
He’s the kind of guy that just has to be the center of attention in anything. If he’s not, he will hijack a conversation in any manner he can to redirect it to him. You could be talking about fish and he’d start doing push ups and challenging people to a competition. It’s very draining, hence me only seeing him very rarely. After his divorce, he’s reached out a lot but I just keep the ‘I’m busy excuse rolling’
On to today. 
He left something at my house last time I saw him, and has been bugging me regularly to get it back. Today the stars aligned where I felt I could deal with him, and get this back to him so he’ll stop calling me. 
(Yes, he actually calls me)
He shows up with some 19 year old dude he befriended (were in our 40s) and just goes off on how long we’ve been friends. I give his item back to him, and just start making small talk while he puts the item in his truck. Upon returning and seeing us in mid conversation, he goes off about how the 4th of July made him think he was back in Iraq. Now…I’ve known him since he was 25ish…he’s never mentioned military experience to me before. He then goes on about how he was a captain, and saw some real stuff. I asked him where he went to officer school at. He himmed and hawed for a while before saying he forgot, but look at the disabled veteran plates on his truck. And those were there. I did mention that most vets say the 4th sounds nothing like a live war zone, and we left it at that. So he dropped that and went off on trans gender athletes. A subject I don’t think much about, and don’t really have an opinion on. Other than to think those obsessed with trans athletes, are weird for being that into it. Which I said. After that, they suddenly were late and booked it to go. I wasn’t exactly sad to see them leave, but I do kinda feel like I was a little mean by pointing out a few flaws in his military story and then kinda mocking him on his trans opinions.

25,1e47cg8,AITA for telling a girl she shouldn't be assuming things about me based on my family circumstances?,"I(17F) am Chinese-American. My parents immigrated to the US from China and I was born in the US. I recently attended a sleepaway camp with other 16-18 year olds. The camp was a week long. Towards the last few days of camp, we had gotten to know each other more and were talking one day at breakfast. There were a few of us girls(around 4-5 of us) at a table.

Our conversation shifted to us talking about our families and one girl(I'll call her Anna) started talking about how she has a lot of extended family near where she lives. She has a lot of aunts, uncles, and cousins, and visits them regularly to hang out and have fun together. She also talked about how her aunts and uncles and grandparents give her a lot of gifts during her birthday and Christmas. She talked for a while before eventually turning the conversation to me in order to ask me about my family.

I told her that most of my extended family is in China, so I don't get to see them often. I recently went back to visit them in June, but the last time I visited them before the June trip was the summer of 2019. My closest extended family is in California, which is across the country from where I live in the Midwest. Therefore, I don't get to see my extended family very often. I'm content with that and my immediate family of my mom, my dad, my brother and I get along well with each other.

I told the table of girls this and they were mostly silent. Then Anna spoke up and said that it sucks that I don't get to see my extended family often. She said that it must be sad and depressing because I don't get to have fun with my family often or that I don't get as many birthday or Christmas gifts from them. The tone she used when saying it sounded like she was saying something bad about me. Looking back, perhaps she was just shocked in the moment. But instead I got a little angry, because I didn't like that she was making assumptions about me like that.

Then I said back that I didn't like that she made baseless assumptions about me just because I don't get to see my extended family as often as she does. It's not my fault that most of my family lives across an ocean. I told her that I'm fine with my immediate family, and that I still have good times with my extended family during the few times I go to see them.

For the rest of camp the group of us girls still hung out with each other, but the atmosphere felt more tense and uncomfortable after I said that to Anna.

26,1e47bor,"AITA for blocking a guy that I met once 9,5 years ago after he asked for money, but waiting for a week while not saying no immediately. ","So, 9 years ago I (30m) went on a College trip to a city in another country and I vaguely remember talking to some guy in front of our hostel. We added each other on Facebook and had ONE very short Facebook conversation a bit later ('how are you? I'm fine how are you? Where are you now? Oh there okay... this style)

Fast forward to 9,5 years further, this guy starts texting me on Facebook in his language (which I also speak, but not that well) with a short how are you and that he's in his home country right now (not the one I visited, a northern African one). 

He then asked for money for his passport and said that he would treat me very well if I'd ever visit his country.

Now, while I know that the money I'd send over WU for example would 99,99% be a goner and I'd never see this guy or be treated well by him when visiting his country I was kinda doubting just posting a small sum. Still a bigger chance than to win the lottery, I figured.

But, this happened before me leaving on a week long holiday so my exact words were: I can't help you at the moment. The earliest would be on July 13th, later corrected to 14th.

During the holiday he texted a few times, hi, how are you, etc but I ignored this cause I wanted to focus on being on a holiday.

Then on the 13th he said 'You help me' 'it's the 13th'. I was still quite tired from traveling and couldn't care less anymore (and annoyed by the few messages during my holiday and the immediate asking for help the day I claimed to return home (that I corrected immediately after to one day later) so I just blocked him without saying anything.

Recently, my parents have been irreparably angry with me. Like shouting at me almost 24/7 for reasons I don't even understand. I don't do anything, I stay home, I'm knee deep in my college courses, I don’t hang out with my friends much, I go to church and I sing choir, I live by a curfew that I don't break even by a few seconds. They keep claiming that I ""have to be lying"" about everything I do. The only thing I really lie about is going to therapy, which I do in secret because I have a couple of mental problems going on.

I've done everything correctly, followed all the rules, did everything right, it's never enough. 

I want to leave, I want to get out of my house and start anew someplace else. I have friends willing to house me and I have a remote part-time job, I know I will be okay.

30,1e46f6k,AITAH for not having the same hobbies as my partner?,"TLDR, my partner is upset that we don’t share the same hobbies anymore and that I don’t like the same video games he likes. 

AITAH? I am 32F and my partner is 30M. He spends his free time playing a variety of video games and watching shows/anime. He doesn’t have other hobbies outside of this. That’s not an issue to me, just painting the picture.

I have a lot of different hobbies and used to be more of a “gamer” when we met. I have since stopped playing most games other than a few that I honestly get made fun of for playing because “they aren’t real games”. I play a game called Sky to relax and have really been into the remastered Tomb Raider collection on PS5. Other than that I like to figure skate to exercise and be healthy. I love to travel! I’d love to move somewhere I can comfortably hike and explore new places. I guess I just have a general curiosity for life and spontaneity and don’t like to be cooped up inside very much.

Everytime my partner and I get into an argument, the fact that I don’t play any of the games he likes gets brought up. He gets mad I won’t play Minecraft and stardew valley mainly with him. I have tried to play both games with him multiple times, but they just aren’t fun to me. He then gets mad that we don’t share any of the same hobbies.

AITAH? I am 32F and my partner is 30M. He spends his free time playing a variety of video games and watching shows/anime. He doesn’t have other hobbies outside of this. That’s not an issue to me, just painting the picture.

I have a lot of different hobbies and used to be more of a “gamer” when we met. I have since stopped playing most games other than a few that I honestly get made fun of for playing because “they aren’t real games”. I play a game called Sky to relax and have really been into the remastered Tomb Raider collection on PS5. Other than that I like to figure skate to exercise and be healthy. I love to travel! I’d love to move somewhere I can comfortably hike and explore new places. I guess I just have a general curiosity for life and spontaneity and don’t like to be cooped up inside very much.

Everytime my partner and I get into an argument, the fact that I don’t play any of the games he likes gets brought up. He gets mad I won’t play Minecraft and stardew valley mainly with him. I have tried to play both games with him multiple times, but they just aren’t fun to me. He then gets mad that we don’t share any of the same hobbies. I get this to an extent, but it’s hard when the only hobbies he has is watching tv or playing video games. I feel like we are growing apart and I am being blamed for this.

31,1e46ejt,AITA for telling my best friend that she talks to much about her baby?,"
My(f32) best friend, let's call her Mia (34) , and I have been close friends for over 10 years. We were roommates for a few years and did almost everything together. Since Mia moved to the outskirts of our city with her husband, our relationship has changed a bit. We don’t see each other as often, but we still talk regularly on the phone.

Mia has always been one of those people who likes to be the center of attention, talks a lot about herself, and generally takes up a lot of space. Normally, this doesn’t bother me because she is otherwise wonderful, and we have talked about it a few times. However, since Mia had a baby, things have reached a new level. Whenever we talk on the phone, it's exclusively about the baby—when he eats, when he sleeps, how much he sleeps... I love the little guy, but I don’t have kids myself, and at some point, I just lose interest in all the baby talk. 

Moreover, I would like to share my life with her  too and not just be on the receiving end of her monologues. This situation reached a climax recently when I returned from a three-week trip with another mutual friend. I called Mia to tell her about my experiences, but I couldn't get a word in. She talked non-stop about her baby for 30 minutes and didn’t ask me a single question. I eventually just started talking about my trip, but she was totally disinterested and interrupted me after a few minutes to go back to baby topics. 

At some point, I interrupted her and told her that it hurt me that she didn’t ask about my experiences and didn’t seem interested in my life anymore. She said it hurt her that I spend so much time with other friends and that she wished I showed more interest in her baby. I then told her that for the past six months, we've only talked about her and her baby, and I shared some things about my life (like a promotion) that she didn’t know about because she was only interested in her child. She accused me of being selfish and not understanding how hard it is to be a new mom. 

At that point, I lost my temper a bit and asked her why she expected me to be interested in her baby's sleep schedule when she showed absolutely no interest in my life and told her she talks way too much about herself and her baby. She cried, and since then, we haven’t  spoken.

42,1e43nhr,AITA for telling my sister I wouldn't support her if she has a kid with her boyfriend's cousin?,"My younger sister and I are very close and live in the same city. We have always been close and have a good relationship with our parents. She is young (26) but has been living with her older bf (34) for around 2 years now-this is her first relationship ever.

My parents and I do not like him much for a variety of reasons-including our perception of him being very unkind, always asking her for help on absolutely everything (was fired twice), her being visibly exhausted, him talking badly about us (while reaping all types of holidays and favors) and so on. I specify ""our perception"" because she keeps repeating she is very satisfied with him. As she is an adult her opinion stands of course, but so does mine.

Recently they have discovered he cannot have children-they had been trying. My sister was absolutely heartbroken for quite a few months as she has always wanted a family. They have only been together for 2 years so I was secretly hoping this would be a deal breaker (sorry!)-also because he was against adoption.

After much persuasion by her, he agreed on adoption or on IVF. He keeps insisting that the kid should still have his DNA and thereby the IVF should be from his cousin-which upon further research is not uncommon but still sounds weird. He also mentions ""safety"" concerns as you never know with ""other people's"" DNA-though rest assured that with his DNA there are so many medical problems in his family nonetheless.

This was a bit of a final strand type of thing-not because I do not like game of thrones but because I have always been unhappy seeing her in this relationship-which IMHO makes her very unhappy (despite her asserting the contrary). The consensus opinion among her friends and family is that the bf won't even put up with the future kid from his cousin (as religious as he is). I'm not being pessimistic but I really do picture her alone with this cousin's kid in 5 years, asking for financial and medical support.

I have no idea how she will want to play things out with the future kid but I kind of feel sorry for the kid already. I tried to discourage her from this last idea by telling her that if she does have that poor kid with the cousin, I will not support her as the situation is just too absurd and I don't want to be part of it (though if it comes down to it I will, but I want to try discouraging her).

She said I was being unfair and mean towards her bf as I should not care where the future kid is from. Now, I know that most of the situation should be ""none of my business"" but considering that she will rely on me for a lot of support with the kid (as always) I can't help but feel this is a bit too much. AITA?

EDIT: By ""support""-it means babysitting, picking the kid up, taking care of the kid etc. I'm specifying this because there are already so many things my parents and I support her with that should be the responsibility of the bf instead. So I don't want to end up becoming the permanent babysitter once her bf walks away from her-which IMHO is a likely scenario.

43,1e436tt,AITA for kicking out a guy my friend wanted to set me up with?,"I’m really not a person who brings things to internet but I just really want opinions from people who don’t know the people involved. 

I have a friend “Jess”. I’ve known Jess a couple of years, through another friend. We’re all in the same group of friends which is a group of 7. 

For the past year, Jess has been trying to convince me to date, even though I have no interest in it. My ex was the only person I’ve ever dated and I never had any interest in dating/relationships before or since. We also share a child together and being a parent is demanding enough. 

Jess is always inviting me to dinner parties and trying to set me up with guests, suggesting people I should go out with, etc., and it drives me up the wall. She is well meaning, she is a hopeless romantic and wants me to be happy and I get that but she won’t let up no matter how many times I tell her to leave it. 

That’s the context. 

On Saturday, I hosted a small gathering at my home. My ex was also at the party since we have mutual friends. There were less than 20 people total. I saw Jess arrive with someone and thought it was a date. But random, since I hadn’t actually said plus ones were welcome but whatever. 

But when Jess came over and introduced her “date”, it turns out it was another guy she wanted me to meet. I was…not surprised, but still extremely annoyed. I organised this evening to just hang out with my friends and here Jess goes again, doing the thing that I asked her not to do that she knows causes me stress. Side note - how tf did she think I was going to be getting to know a man in front of my ex…awkward much? It just felt so obnoxious of her to disregard my expressed feelings in my own home. 

I told Jess that she and her friend had to go. I apologised to him but said Jess had brought him here under false pretences, and due to her behaviour she was no longer welcome in my home so he wasn’t either. Jess was taken aback and started apologising. Eventually my ex came over and told her to leave at which point she started crying. Everyone saw what happened and tried to defuse the situation but I wanted her gone and she left. 

Since then, Jess has reached out to apologise but also say I overreacted and use her typical excuse of wanting me to be happy. No one has spoken to me about it directly but I know from my ex that a couple of our friends think I was harsh to kick her out. I get that it was dramatic, but I really feel I was justified. 

I just want some third party perspective on whether I went overboard before I approach a conversation with Jess.

When I was 17 I found my bio mother and started a relationship with her. Through her I found out who and where my biological father was and that he denied any paternity when she was pregnant.

Fast forward to 2005, when I was 21. I was in the general area of where my bio father lived and decided to go introduce myself. To be entirely honest, I essentially ambushed him. He lives in a very small town where everyone knows everyone, so I was able to find him very easily. 

When I introduced myself I told him that I was informed he was my bio father, to which he said he was never told that my mother was ever pregnant or that he was the father. Whether that is true or not, that I was here and based off of our shared familiar features, it was very apparent he is indeed my bio father. I stated I would be open to having a relationship with him if he was interested in such. We exchanged phone numbers and I left. 

A day or so later I received a call from him asking if he could come to the town where I lived so we could meet up and have coffee and talk. We did meet up at a local restaurant. Once there we exchanged information about ourselves and our lives. I was told that he was married and that he never told anyone about me. We left that meeting with a very tentative agreement that we would keep in touch and see how things go.

Well, after about 3 phone calls and 1 short visit later, we lost touch. Because it has been so long now I can’t remember if he stopped taking my calls or exactly what happened. But we haven’t seen or spoken to one another since. I have chalked it up to him not wanting any kind of relationship with me.

In 2006 or 2007 I did try to reach out to his mother via letter in an attempt to get his family’s medical background. But I did not get any kind of response.

Quite a few things have changed since any of this transpired. I’ve gotten married and have had kids, moved states and successfully battled cancer, so on and so forth. Yesterday I happened to come across the obituary for his mother who passed away in March of this year.
It has since gotten me thinking about my bio father. So much time has passed that even if he had wanted to reach out to me I doubt he would be able to. (New last name, address, and phone number)

For context, My brother is the golden child ESPECIALLY to my mom.

I’m not gonna mince words, my brother’s relationship to our mom is unhealthy.

She gets competitive with his girlfriends and is plain nasty to all of them, SIL was no different she was just willing to put up with it more until she snapped after a recent incident. 

While he was at our parents house, my SIL texted him to discuss custody arrangements for their daughter, it devolved into an argument with him calling her all sorts of names and telling her to grow up with my mom egging him on. The last thing she texted was “We’ll talk when you take your mom’s tit out of your mouth and stop choking on her milk so you can actually act like a man.” and then blocked him.

She started to tell him that due to all the trauma he has been through in his life that he is going to struggle. She said that she can tell that he has addiction behaviors and that he is very similar to my dad (My dad had multiple affairs and my parents are still married) She told me that I deserve better and that. She also told me I was staying in this relationship because I was desperate for love and was worried I wouldn’t find another person.
I ended up telling my fiancé and now he won't go to many family events if she's there.
Now the main point. Like I mentioned before we are planning to get an apartment and we are really close to being able to get one soon. And with everything that has happened and the fact that I've always felt like the black sheep I'm debating on going to this vacation. Since my Fiance won't be going I know for a fact my mom will make comments since every single time I visit the house and he isn't there with me she always makes comments. I also want to make money since this would be unpaid time off you know?


",Everyone Sucks,2024-07-15,"WIBTA if I didn’t go on my family vacation because my mom made comments about my fiancé? My (21F) Fiancé (20M) and my mom (46F) don't really get along. It all started when she made comments about him being adopted and calling him bio parents his ""real parents"". Him and I currently live at his parents house due to it being closer to my college and he's working around the area.

after years of chronic pain, i discovered a few months ago that i have a massive tumor on my spine and had to have a very risky surgery that almost paralysed me from the waist down (luckily the surgery went really well). Sarah and I spend the morning together a month after my surgery and during the 4 hours we were together, she didn't ask me once how i was doing. we never even talked about the surgery or the fact that i was in the hospital. i tried to change the subject and to talk about me a few times but she compleatly ignored me and redirected the conversation about her. now i'm not saying that i want to talk about myself for hours, but something pretty traumatic happened to me so i would at least hope that we would talk about how i was doing instead of talking about the situationship she had 3 years ago. it just makes me feel so bad and makes me so angry because i feel like she doesn't care about me and only hangs out with me to treat me like a therapist. i want to confront her and talk to her about it but at the same time i don't want to be mean. what should i do?

53,1e40x7r,AITA for not accepting a brand new phone I didn’t ask for? ,"*throwaway just in case* 
My dad’s love language is gift giving. It’s been more apparent to me the older i get that he’ll just randomly buy things for me my sister or my mom that he thinks we’ll like or he’ll check with us so he knows we like it. This is also coupled with an overspending problem but that’s not the topic here. Any time he offers to buy me something, I tend to tell him no because I don’t like what he’s offering or I don’t want him spending money on something I don’t need. For example, his recent go to fix has been Temu. He offered to buy me a phone case, I declined, he bought it anyway, then got upset i didn’t take it and said i was being selfish and i don’t appreciate the love he gives me. It’s happened quite a few times and I just move on from it. 

Something we do is if our family back home in Africa needs a new phone or device, we’ll buy ourselves a new one then send the old one back home. Currently, one of my siblings in Africa needs a new phone. I currently have the oldest phone in my family (Blue iPhone 13 Pro Max) so we agreed that I would get a new phone and my current one would get sent back. My dad said he would get me the 15 Pro Max and i told him not to because they didn’t have the blue color I wanted and there was no reason to spend over $1,400 on one when I could just get the 14 plus for cheaper and i could get everything i needed with it. We argued about it for awhile but he eventually agreed that i would just get the 14 plus. Fast forward a few weeks, and i come home to a black 15 pro max. I told my dad to return it as it wasn’t the phone I wanted and didn’t want him wasting money on it. He began his usual spiel of calling me ungrateful and selfish and I didn’t appreciate the sacrifices he makes as a father. My mom and sister then proceeded to join in saying I should just take the phone even if I don’t like it because my dad got it for me. We all began yelling at each other before I just grabbed my keys and left. 

We’re no where near a high income family so I don’t want to come off as spoiled or anything but I genuinely don’t think I’m in the wrong. I explicitly asked to get the cheaper item that I knew I liked/wanted and am now getting attitude for not accepting the more expensive item that was already said that I didn’t like or want. It’s not that I don’t appreciate it  because I certainly do. My dad is not an emotional person so I take any bit of love he throws my way but I also don’t want to feel forced to accept something I don’t want. 


So, AITA? 

TLDR; My dad bought me a Black iPhone 15 Pro Max so he can send my current phone back to Africa even though I explicitly told him I didn’t want the 15 because it was more expensive and not the color I wanted.

55,1e408o7,AITAH for not giving money to my partner when I (29F) already pay for everything while he (38M) takes care of the household things?,"So I (29F) am the breadwinner of this household, Im working full time as a nurse to support us through the summer. I own a business aswell, but the business doesn’t have work in the summertime. We are aiming to work for my business together as partners starting this autumn, and Im making large investments to make it profitable for 2 people. These investments are to cost around 50.000€ total. 

We had agreed that I go to work, because I make more money as a nurse than he does at his profession and he’d take on the household and caring for business related machinery and prep work for autumn at home. 

We agreed that he doesn’t contribute to any household costs, I pay for everything 100% and the additional investments to create work for him aswell. These investments have included a car, other machinery, personal gear etc for him which Im paying for. Also all the food, outings etc I am covering 100%

As you can imagine, money is thight right now and he knows it, as I have told him the true states of our financial situation. 

Now he told me he feels insecure because he doesn’t make any money and he has to ask me for things to buy (food, supplies etc). And is asking me to pay him a salary of some sort for the work he does regarding our business. I refused this, as I pay for all the utilities and business related costs regardless. He feels this is unfair for him and I do not value his work and effort because I refuse to pay him a salary. 

Am I the asshole for not paying him a salary?

EDIT; I forgot to add to the Original Post more detail. My partner does not shop for food or other things at all, I do all of that aswell. I also do the cooking, cleaning, laundry and household chores. And for growing ’’my’’ business is misleading, because he’s a partner in that business. I have already bought him a car and personal gear to use. 

EDIT2 + INFO: 
So I wrote this post in bit of a hurry and also deliberately left out details to avoid being recognized. I have been reading your comments and I appreciate all aspects. I’ll try to open the situation a bit more because this situation seems to confuse a lot of people. 

- Initially my spouse quit his job because of poor working conditions and bullying, he has been unemployed for 5 months so far. I have been supporting him this whole time. 
- He started helping around the business stuff out of boredom when I was working in my business, and then we started planning on creating more work for the business to support us both
- Initially agreed he’d invest his own money to the business and build his share that way. This didn’t happen because in the end he didn’t have the funds to invest. 
- Then we discussed this and agreed that because I can support us financially out of my paycheck in nursing in summertime and invest my company profits + take out a loan to invest towards creating him a partner position in the business. He agreed to help do the prep work for his share through the summer and take care of the household as compensation to my financial investments
- In the end he does not contribute to the household chores, not because I don’t let him, but because he doesn’t know what needs to be done and when. I have asked him to do things like hoover, clean etc but these things simply doesnt get done so I have taken over. 
- he lost his driving licence a month ago and therefore unable to do any shopping or errands himself. And before losing his license he didn’t do them, because he didn’t know what needed to be purchased and found it more convenient when I did all running errands. 
- During the summer the company makes 0 turnover and 0 profit. All the company funds are tied to investments and mandatory payments and other running costs through the summer. 
- the only income is my nursing salary at the moment
- What he contributes to: household chores like emptying dishwasher, folding laundry, making snacks, taking care of our pets, doing the basic maintenance for the company, building his share for the company and prepping for his work, small building jobs for the company, fixing things. 
- When the company starts making money we can split everything 50-50, we have agreed to a joint personal account for household costs and left over is personal spending money once company costs are deducted.

57,1e3zy6g,WIBTA for asking people not to use the path in the park for playing cricket as it blocks all pedestrians from using that?,"I, 17M was walking my dog in a public park. The pathway goes through a grassy area and branches off, one leading to a playground and the other into a field. I was walking my dog along the path in the park down the route to the field and for some reason, there was a group of people playing cricket on the path. It was annoying to me because there was a large amount of space to play on both sides of the path as it was going through a field anyway. Also, it just seemed inconsiderate to me because some pedestrians may not want to stray from the path to avoid getting covered in mud or for other reasons. I wanted to say something because this isn’t the first time I’ve seen the same group of people obstructing the path when they have numerous other areas of the park at their disposal but I didn’t because I felt like it would upset the children in the group who seemed to be enjoying themselves. There were four adults and eight children. I just didn’t know how to handle the situation because it’s a large park and they have so much space to play but they choose the one place where people walk to play.

I, 17M was walking my dog in a public park. The pathway goes through a grassy area and branches off, one leading to a playground and the other into a field. I was walking my dog along the path in the park down the route to the field and for some reason, there was a group of people playing cricket on the path. It was annoying to me because there was a large amount of space to play on both sides of the path as it was going through a field anyway. Also, it just seemed inconsiderate to me because some pedestrians may not want to stray from the path to avoid getting covered in mud or for other reasons. I wanted to say something because this isn’t the first time I’ve seen the same group of people obstructing the path when they have numerous other areas of the park at their disposal but I didn’t because I felt like it would upset the children in the group who seemed to be enjoying themselves. There were four adults and eight children. I just didn’t know how to handle the situation because it’s a large park and they have so much space to play but they choose the one place where people walk to play.

58,1e3zova,"AITA for not giving his girl ex-girlfriend a ""second chance""","OK I want to start with the fact that this has been going on for about 3 months now and I have no clue why. The first time I met her in person I was over at his place (lives with a few friends) and walked down. I got introduced to her by one of his friends while he was doing something on the other side of the basement. She looked me up and down and just gave me a bad vibe. I was also pregnant and exhausted, so I just decided I was going upstairs for the night to lay down. upon doing this I learned that the vent in his room basically just echos into his room. I was NOT trying to listen but eventually ended up hearing her getting a little friendly and just ignored it.

Now this is the big issue that has started a downfall. clearly up to this point I'm not her biggest fan but I also have no real issue with her. I find out she is going to be at a party they are all throwing. This party was big, and I brought one of my friends. She shows up and me and my fiancé are sitting talking to some of his other friends while I wait for my friend to show. She walks in and sits down with another group and that's that. She hops around the party and soon my friend shows up. We are standing to the side, and she runs up to my fiancé, grabs his arm and says ""I haven't got to see you all night"" . My friend looks at me and I just shrug. until she keeps trying to get all close to him and I start to get a bit irritated. me and my friend walk away so I can show her the basement because she asked, and he comes running after us weird but whatever. After this point the whole night is basically filled with what I would say a one-sided battle all her. she runs up to him any time I'm not with him, gets touchy with him, makes weird comments, one being how ""if she got to know me maybe we can all share a bed"", offers him seats next to her and so on. I will give him this, I don't think he was fully aware of everything happening because he was enjoying the party activities but I was growing more frustrated as this game went on. Eventually I was over it and we both went to bed. In the morning, we talked about what happened and he said maybe it was just that she was drinking and wasn't really thinking. I simply don't think that's an excuse. He ends up calling her to talk about this and she said she was just messing around and not to take it so seriously.

That brings us to the 4th of July and most of the night I was met with side eyes and dirty looks. I ignored her and me and my fiancé went to bed early when he started feeling a bit sick.

After this get together where we again avoided each other I was asked several times if I would be willing to talk with her. I kept saying that I don't feel comfortable around her because of her behavior when I had been around her. now just a few days ago she sends a message saying something like ""I don't know where we stand but there's this party and you're both invited"" I said to him that it was in a bar (why would I want to be in a bar pregnant) and again I don't really feel comfortable around her. he got pushy I gave up and said fine whatever we will go. the next day i explain I thought about it and I'm really not comfortable with this and don't want to go. he starts to go on about how I'm being sensitive and overthinking and I say ""why is it that you're so willing to put me in an uncomfortable situation but feel bad for hurting her feelings over not going to this party"" there are tears and i continue to get upset while he tells me it's not like that and he thinks we just never go the chance to talk and get to know each other and other people will be there. Yesterday he let me know that he called her and explained how I was feeling and all she had to say about that was that I was wrong and it's because we never got introduced (we did though...) I sat there fully given up. him calling her to discuss the problems we had been having felt like a slap in the face and I didn't even know what to say. now he keeps saying she is a good friend and he wants to be able to talk and hanout with her and I'm being unfair for not giving her another chance but I feel like I'm not, so AITA

59,1e3zguu,AITA for telling my boyfriend his mother basically told me to leave him? ,"So my boyfriend‘s mom texted me asking if I could go to her house to cut her hair which I’ve done in the past. Now I haven’t really seen her often because with this much of the story, I’ll let you know that my boyfriend and I tried to keep as much space between her as we can do to drama in the past. So I will admit I was a bit nervous to go over by myself, but I figured I’m giving her a haircut. What’s the big deal? I’m just gonna do that and leave. I asked my boyfriend Chad if he would come with me because I was nervous to go by myself in case I would get cornered into any questions. Chad said it’s been such time and his mom loves me so much that he would really like for me to go there and bond with her. I agreed that was a good idea so I made my time to go and do the haircut. That same day we were having a refrigerator delivery so we had to make sure somebody was home for the delivery which Chad said he would be so it was fine for me to go and do the haircut in the morning. When I got to his mother’s house, I started the haircut and the people for the delivery were calling me to say they were outside, but nobody was opening my door. I was calling Chad to get the door, but he had fallen back asleep and his mother is witnessing me calling him and realizing he’s not answering the phone. Then it begins. “OK I’m going to be hard on you now. What are you doing with him? “ how long are you going to put up with somebody like this?” “ he is not a good person. I have prayed for him and I realize that he has a bad soul.” “ I know you think he has money, but it won’t be for long. I am changing my will.” (Now she’s insinuating. I’m a gold digger.) “ this is the man you want to marry? This is who you want to be the father of your child?” I continue to cut her hair. I just answer in questions like what length would you like? Do you want a lot of volume? kind of ignoring the comments? Chad does end up answering and getting the delivery fixed by the way. Anyways, in that moment, I felt uncomfortable and I just felt like it wasn’t her place to be speaking to me like that and I kind of have to admit it wasn’t the first time, but it was never that aggressive. It was subliminally in other ways insinuating that we shouldn’t be together. Anyways back to the big question am I the a**** for telling my boyfriend that his mother pretty much told me to leave him and that he was not a good person? Because that’s exactly what I did when I got home. I told him what happened what went down and he was so upset. He reaches out to her and mentions the entire story and now she has called me and texted me paragraphs saying it was a woman to woman conversation and how dare I mention it. Part of me feels like I broke a girl code, but another part of me feels like it was important for me to tell him that I didn’t like those comments and it made me upset.. so now it’s all up in the air not sure what’s next.

60,1e3zdqh,WIBTA If I Snapped and Insulted At a Team,"I should give some background information before I get started and explain why I think I'd be the asshole.

I've been playing volleyball for about 4 year for the same school. 3 years for the middle school and this year for the highschool. I was the first few girl on the middle school team, when they just opened the sport to us. 

And since 6th grade, there was this girl I'll call C. She was evil and rude to me, even though she was in the 7th grade at the time.

The team only kept her because she was good and played club before she tried out for us. She boast about her club wins which to be honest none of us really cared about expect the coaches.

She always made snarky comments about the way I play. She kept going until she left for highschool and STILL continues to talk the way I play.

I never said anything because I wanted to say on the team and if I snapped back I'd be in trouble. Now this year, I don't wanna deal with her BS anymore. And I've grown since then, I've developed a bit of a mouth on me. 

Tomorrow is a summer show case for varsity. And of course she's on varsity. She's never shown up for a single practice since June! And AAU been ended. So where was she? I don't know and I truly don't care. 

I have a feeling when I go help with the showcase, she'll find a way to be disrespectful to me like
She did last year. I have no interest of having to deal with that this year. Or any year as a matter of fact.

My family says don't do anything rude or brash. And don't insult her, even though she's insulted not only me but other players and got away with it. She's gets away with so many things. Like having C's to F's and STILL being on a team, but if I have a D in one class I'll have the chance of missing a game and getting kicked off?

I really wanna pop off on her at least once. To really put her in her place. She's no better than anyone else.

62,1e3zaa9,AITA for not getting drunk at a party?,"So for context, I have been with my boyfriend for 7 years and got engaged last year. I have never drank (teetotal) and he drinks sometimes but isn't a big drinker. When we met, within minutes he asked if I went to many parties and I said no as I didn't drink and he even said he liked that about me. I've never tried to hide it even when I've been judged for it. I'm unapologetic about who I am and have my reasons. It's never appealed to me so I don't see the point, I don't like the smell or taste. My father also drank a lot when I was a child and this ruined my parents marriage and he was also caught drink driving. I don't like the idea of not being in control of my body after other things that happened to me as a child when I was vulnerable. Needless to say, I have good reasons for not wanting to touch the stuff. 

My partner doesn't drink a lot. He doesn't go to loads of parties or anything like that as it's  not really his cup of tea. However, last night he was invited over to his friend's. I offered to take him and pick him up as I knew there would be drinking involved. He messaged me to come and pick him up so I did. One of his friends came out and asked me to come in for one drink as he hadn't seen me in a while and I hadn't really met the others so I did. I walked in and they all hugged me and said how beautiful I was (I'm in my late 20s and he's 40 so a lot of people are surprised when I walk in). It was all fine and he said we'd leave after I had my coke but then they decided they'd all take tequila shots.

My partner shouldn't really be drinking tequila. He's a bit of lightweight anyway and certain alcohol makes him feel really unwell or angry, and that's one of them. They did the shots and continued drinking. I could hear at some point in the night his friend's wife bitching about me with my partner, asking if I was alright and was implying that I was boring. My partner said I was fine and 'just tired'. Later on I quietly asked him what she had said about me as I didn't understand what I had done wrong. He got annoyed at me and eventually we left.

Once we were in the car, he effectively shouted at me the whole way home. He said that I was 'dull' and 'embarrassing' because I don't drink. He accused me of 'making a scene' when I quietly asked him (out of earshot from everyone else) what was being said about me. He then went on to tell me that I needed to 'get a life' and that 'I'm 'thick as shit'.  I said I was sorry for whatever I had done wrong and cried myself to sleep thinking I had messed up.

However, I've woken up today and I'm not sure that I actually did do anything wrong at all. I have social anxiety so I'm not great in situations where I don't know anyone. To be honest I think he should apologise to me for being verbally abusive .

63,1e3z6ce,AITA for being rude to my uncle and making my mom cry. ,"Hi! My sister (15F) and I (19F) are used to living in a house without any males because our parents separated, and now we live with our grandma and mom.

So, my mom has a brother, and I hate him. I show my dislike every single day, even to my grandma, who is his mother.

This man keeps coming to our house without any warning! He’ll suddenly come up the stairs while my sister and I are in our towels because the bathroom is right next to the stairs.

One time, I was calling for my grandma while I was completely fucking naked. *(I didn’t care because I am so used to being surrounded by women in the house.)* I didn’t know he had gone upstairs, so I peeked out the door naked and saw him standing there, fucking staring at me! He didn't even tell me that my grandma wasn't there; he just waited for me to peek. He wasn’t even sorry. 

He has been doing this since the pandemic, **ever since we were minors!**

I have told my mom a hundred times to ask my uncle not to do that or at least give some signs when he's inside our house. But my mom keeps telling me that she pities him because he's in a bad marriage. *I don’t care really, he deserves that*

I told my mom that I don't care because that's not my point; my point is that we're getting harassed in our own house by her brother. I asked her, ""Do you want me to talk to him and tell it to his face?"" But she suddenly broke down and cried. She told me that he is her only brother and that he is suffering in his life, and that no one loves him, etc. 

I didn't know what to do because I also didn't want to see my mom cry, so I didn't talk to him. I also told my grandma about our situation, and she also said to let it pass.

So, my mom has a brother, and I hate him. I show my dislike every single day, even to my grandma, who is his mother.

This man keeps coming to our house without any warning! He’ll suddenly come up the stairs while my sister and I are in our towels because the bathroom is right next to the stairs.

One time, I was calling for my grandma while I was completely fucking naked. *(I didn’t care because I am so used to being surrounded by women in the house.)* I didn’t know he had gone upstairs, so I peeked out the door naked and saw him standing there, fucking staring at me! He didn't even tell me that my grandma wasn't there; he just waited for me to peek. He wasn’t even sorry. 

He has been doing this since the pandemic, **ever since we were minors!**

I have told my mom a hundred times to ask my uncle not to do that or at least give some signs when he's inside our house. But my mom keeps telling me that she pities him because he's in a bad marriage. *I don’t care really, he deserves that*

I told my mom that I don't care because that's not my point; my point is that we're getting harassed in our own house by her brother. I asked her, ""Do you want me to talk to him and tell it to his face?"" But she suddenly broke down and cried. She told me that he is her only brother and that he is suffering in his life, and that no one loves him, etc. 

I didn't know what to do because I also didn't want to see my mom cry, so I didn't talk to him. I also told my grandma about our situation, and she also said to let it pass.

Since he's been doing this for years, and especially now that I'm going to college and leaving my sister alone, I really want it to stop.

65,1e3yws9,AITA for taking my house key from my Roomate’s friend?,"I (20f) have two roommates Sam (21f) and Kate (20f). We all attend the same university in our town and have lived together for a year but have been friends for close to 2 years. 

Kate and Sam have this friend named Maggie. Maggie also attends the same university we do but she lives 40 minutes outside of the town we live in. (Rent is cheaper outside of town)

Maggie works and goes to class in town and often only has an hour or two between work and class. Which makes it hard to head home between classes and work. So she would drive from class to her job and hangout in the parking lot. 

Kate and Sam heard this and felt bad for Maggie. So they started letting her hangout at our house between work and school. Initially one or both of them would be home and would let her in. 

After a while all of us came to a decision and decided to just give Maggie a key to our house. On the grounds that Maggie texts us before she arrives and when she leaves and cleans up any messes she might make. 

Maggie was quiet, clean, and didn’t cause any issues. 

Recently I had my boyfriend over and Maggie happened to be here doing some homework before she left for work. My bf asked if Maggie was one of my roommates. After I explained the situation my bf pointed out how weird it was. 

After thinking about it more I agreed it was weird to have a stranger in my house come and go as she’s pleased. 

So I brought up the idea of taking Maggie’s key to Sam and Kate. They were against it and didn’t understand why I had a problem now and not months ago when they gave her the key. My bf pointed out they pressured me to agree which Kate and Sam denied. 

So the other day when Maggie came by inbetween class and work I took the house key back from her. And explained how creepy her behavior was to me. Maggie was understanding and left quickly after I took the key. 

Kate and Sam are pissed at me and are saying I’m a major asshole and made a household decision without consulting them. A couple of our other friends think I’m being an asshole. 

My bf agrees with me that it’s my house and I can do whatever I want.

We're both 15m, and to preface this, he used to have a problem of outright gaslighting me whenever we had an argument. I feel he has changed since then, but our communication is definitively not all the way there, and he still does a bit of, albeit quite subtle, gaslighting. 

So, there are 3 main incidents relating to this.

No.1 was a few months ago; he kept leaving Me on read most the times i asked questions to him. I felt quite disrespected, so I asked him to at least tell me if he couldn't respond, as I always do this, like a clear ""I'll respond in a few mins"" or even just ""one sec"". He then got really angry and started saying I expected him to be chronically online and swearing at me. Anyway, he apologised and agreed to let me know if he couldn't respond immediately after reading the message. 

No.2 was when the problem slightly restarted, a couple of weeks ago. We were in that part of a school lesson in the first few minutes where everyone is coming in and there is nothing to do. So I asked him a question and he didn't answer me. I asked it 5+ times, tapped him, and he was just still and silent, eyes open, and I got concerned and told the teacher i thought he was having a catatonic episode or something because I genuinely thought something was wrong. He immediately said ""No I was joking"" and got annoyed I couldn't take a joke. I let that go as a 1 off.

No.3 happened today: I was on the school bus, and I repetitively was asking him a question. He wasn't doing anything. Didn't signal for me to stop talking, just flat out ignored me. I couldn't ask him any more because it got to his stop after a few seconds. There us no way he didn't hear me. 

Frankly, I'm tired of this. It can't be a joke, because there's nothing anyone would find funny about it. It's just plainly disrespectful, and insulting that he doesn't think enough of me to the point where he feels ignoring me for his own joke made to entertain him only is an acceptable response to my questions. Its like I'm an object

I feel like tomorrow, just ignoring him and spilling the beans when he asks me why I'm ignoring him, and while it's tempting it just feels like a petty movie kind of thing that won't achieve anything. I want to have a conversation with him about it but I don't want to deal with his subtle gaslighting either. 

But before I choose a solution, I need to know if I'm overreacting massively and being an asshole. So, AITA ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-15,"AITA for being offended my friend keeps ignoring Me as a joke AITA for being offended my friend keeps ignoring Me as a joke

I'm a 16F and I've been an only child since my parents separated when I was little. My mom met my stepdad at work when I was 6. At first, I missed my dad a lot, and when my mom told me to start calling my stepdad ""Papa,"" I felt pressured and told her I wasn't ready for that yet.

Over the years, I heard arguments between my stepdad and mom. I found out he was already married to another woman before being with my mom, which really upset me. I even heard him begging for forgiveness when my mom confronted him about pictures on his Instagram showing he was still involved with his ex-wife. They argued for hours, and I couldn't take it anymore. I told him to stop crying and leave.

My mom got mad at me for getting involved, saying I was too young to understand. But I was upset because I couldn't understand why she stayed with someone who had lied to her and had another wife. It hurts me to see my mom in relationships with guys who treat her badly, like my stepdad does. I was only 10 that time trying to make my mom realize that she should break up with him. Until now she still stayed with him. I hate my stepdad just because he always blames my mom or me while he is arguing with my mom. 😐

73,1e3x5ot,WIBTA if I ask my husband to let MIL stay back at her place?,"



Me and husband got married last year.  Since then, every couple months, it's either us going and staying with MIL for a month  at a time or its her coming to stay with us for a month at a time. My husband called MIL to live with us till October this time and she has been here since the beginning of May. My husband believes that since she is a widow and according to him hasn't enjoyed much in life , it's time for us to give her the world. 
In the beginning, it was fine as we would mostly visit her and had I had some privacy at MILs place  (husband pays mortgage for that) since it's bigger than where we stay. Here, we stay in a two bedroom apartment with a common balcony. Mil is always at the living area or the balcony. 
I have mondays-sat week of work where I goto office I go to office early morning and reach home after eve. we stay in the living area with MIL and then just go to bed with barely any talking.

Now , my husband even refuses to acknowledge that there is a lack of privacy because of MIl staying here. He says it's great that we enjoy home cooked meal by her ( I make breakfast every day for all, she prepares lunch for two of them and for dinner we share responsibilities. MIL is getting more and more dependent on husband for everything. She doesn't have her own circle of friends and refuses to join groups of similar aged women who invited her saying that she doesn't vibe with them, but she has no problem going to husbands work parties or friends celebrations where the invitations are for full family. 
He walks me to the nearby subway before work, and every day when we leave, MIL is at the door telling him to call her when he is back( in mins usually) so that they can go for a walk. MIL has created a routine where she tells husband to go to the nearby mall ( like target) as we need weekly Groceries. Most of these groceries go to waste and the cycle goes on every week. We have a farmers market nearby with fresh veggies but she insists on going to the mall. When I come home, she tells me of all the adventures they had.   It's been months since just the two of us did something as a couple. We haven't gone for movies. One weekend trip was with MIL where she insisted on shopping several times in days. I just said with a straight face that his mom shops a lot . To which my husband said that she never got to enjoy life , now let her live to the fullest. Although in the last  couple years, I have only seen her shop excessively, to the extent where she spends all her money on shopping.  Obviously husband is happy that his mother is here , she coddles him like a baby, he reasigns tasks I tell him to do ( like changing the water for our indoor plants ) to his mother and she happily does them. MIL has started behaving like she knows more about this place than I do. She gives judgemental looks to my room when it's messy. And the couple of times I had a fight with my husband outside the house ( we can't fight at home in front of her) , she pointed out how husband's face looks small and dry and if he is okay. She said "" I am your mother, I know when you are sad"" casually. The fights were because we don't get any couple time. Since then he took me out once for maybe couplhours. His mother acted grumpy for a few days and we had to appease her a lot so that she went on a trip with us. My husband keeps saying we have to act well to his mother so that she doesn't feel like she is intruding.  Last week when I was at work, husband had a conversation with MIL about when she will come next after October. She said that she will come soon as he won't get food when I got to office.  She is becoming more and more comfortable here. Husband usually works on the office table in our bedroom but she has found a way to make him sit in the living area with her all day. If he wants to come in to work saying he needs to attend a meeting or so, she asks him to attend the meeting in the hall and she won't be disturbed at all. On some saturdays when my husband wants to go out and play sports with his friends, MIL tries her best so that he doesn't go. She says things like ' you are weak , you had that pain  months ago, you don't need to go play you will be hurt. On one such Saturday, my husband came to my office during lunch and we had lunch at a nearby place. When he went home MiL had prepared meals for them both. When he said he was full, she had tears in her eyes and husband had to eat with her again. 
 She isn't a bad person and usually dosen't say much to me but My husband dosen't realise that he is crippling her and making her heavily dependent on him emotionally. How can I deal with this situation?  If I bring it up, he gets angry and says that I create the same ruckus every few weeks.

74,1e3x3mt,AITA for not going out for someones last weekend?,"This person (we will just call Girl), is going away for a year. It was her last weekend in the area and she invited a bunch of people on a night out, including myself. 

Me and Girl in the past like 5 months haven’t been friends. Even previously to that, I hadn’t seen her and our messages would only have been over the phone. Some much needed context is that around 7 months ago she decided to remove me on the platform we spoke on because I had accidentally left her on delivered for a couple weeks. I told her friend I was mates with and turns out they were together at the time and I got a video of her laughing. Then her friend ignored me and we stopped talking too. 

3-4 months later, I get added back by her - we speak every now and then on and off. Cut to 1-2 weeks ago, she puts in a group chat I am in to go out for her last weekend. I don’t like going out already, she knows this because I told her many times. I don’t say I will go in the group, so she messages me directly asking. I just said maybe but I was more inclined not to. 

The weekend comes about, on the day I am still deciding whether I will or not. I decide not to because not as many people that I am friends with were going. At 11pm, she starts calling me. Me expecting a confrontation and me getting anxious over that decides to leave it until tomorrow. 

Next day comes, nothing from her. I though ‘maybe she doesn’t care that much’. Then today, I get a message simply saying “we arent friends anymore”. I just say “ok”. And that’s it.

75,1e3wwnx,AITA for asking for an apology letter from my boyfriend because he poured water on my face while I’m sleeping,"So my bf and I have been together for a year now. We always spend the night together watching movies or shows but i always end up falling asleep he sometimes complain about how i always doze off after the last minutes of the movies since i work all day. 

One lazy sunday afternoon, i fell asleep on the couch i remember asking him to wake me up next time he said“ok”. After a few days i went over to his place and as usual ate dinner then put on a movie for us to watch i fell asleep during the better part of the movie after a while he got up and tried to wake me up after a few minues.I remember him saying “ok I'm going to get water” and warned me i was so exhausted and did not say anything and didn't think he would do it. I felt a few drops on my face and slowly react on what happened i guess he was annoyed and dropped water on me again i got up and thinking “wtf?! why am i with him?!” thats the first think i thought i hesistantly move to the bedroom but then got up and i talked to him that night i told him calmly i didn't like what he did he then justify what he did at first saying he had to do it and he said he gave a warning. Etc.. but again i said dont do it again he promised he woulndt do it again and apologize. 

The next day i made clear that it wasn't cool and i was really upset he gaslit me and said it was just water he jokingly said about making an apology letter and I went along thinking if he really was sorry he would make one. A couple of days later I gradually stop talking to him and asked for the apology letter I was really not angry I just felt really upset about how he was not taking things seriously and how kept my feelings aside I kept bringing it up untill he got mad because I still wouldn't shut up about it. I explained to him again how I felt and I know he said he is sorry but i want him to know my feelings are valid too and him making an apology letter will make me shut up but I still feel upset because he couldnt take my words seriously I point out about the apology letter that I'm not asking for pages upon pages. Even just writing “I'm sorry“ in a note is enough just the thought of him putting a small effort to make me feel better. I know it’s kinda silly but he literally ask me before if I wanted a apology letter I know he is being sarcastic but i said yes! And took it seriously since he didnt seem to bother how felt about everything. 

I'm not asking him too much or to buy me things to apologize, just that simple stupid request but he wouldnt do it or anything. Am i over reacting?

I’ll preface this by saying I loved her then, I love her now, and I’ll love her then. The gravity of what she has gone through and sacrifices for our family is not lost on me, and I honestly find her more attractive with some of the weight on. 

With that said, and hopefully I don’t sound like a pig, I’m concerned about her weight as is if we were to try for another child. We just had our 3rd a couple months ago, and with how easy the last births has been and how easy the babies are she’s already wanting to try for another. 

She has the body type that gains a decent amount of weight during pregnancy and that takes a bit to come back down afterward. But with it being only a couple months I worry she will be well into an unhealthy range  by the end of the next pregnancy. 

I wanted to see if I’m being a total pig here, because I’m honestly coming from a place of her well being over anything else. 

Edit: many good points have been brought up that checking with our doctor is another good step (after my desire to wait a bit anyway) before “going nuclear”

Second edit (probably last): y’all have made a lot of good points, and there are several reasons to wait that aren’t my ascribed reasoning. That has given me something I need to look inward on.

So I had my falling out a little over a month ago the week of my birthday. He came over my house one Friday to spend my birthday weekend with me and my mom. Things were going well as far as I knew until he found out from his mom that night they lost an old family pet. I knew what that meant for him and that be needed time to grieve so I insisted he go home and tried to make it easier by highlighting the more boring parts of the trip like running an errand as I knew he’d have been miserable otherwise with us. Despite my plea, he insisted on going. I knew it was going to end bad but I respected his choice and did not press any further. Almost immediately, he turned passive aggressive from that point on; even going so far as to kick my dog off my bed when she wouldn’t leave him alone. I should have forced him out then and there, but I also understand when emotions get out of whack ya know? He was hurting so I tried to make myself as present and available as I could to help as any friend should.

So as expected, the trip quickly degraded over time. Half way through our adventure he shut down on me(i.e., stopped talking and started shaking) in an Ollies of all places. I tried pressing him for any kind of detail and he insisted his anxiety got the better of him. It was quite clear something more was bothering him but he wouldn’t tell me. Instead he retreated to his phone(maybe shitposting about me who knows?) and barely communicated with me the rest of the day. I got frustrated and annoyed to the point where I ended said I wanted to go home. We got back to my house and parted ways. We were both clearly in our feelings.
The next day he reaches out and proceeds to chat with me like normal; only briefing acknowledging in a sentence that yesterday was rough for us. I called him out for shutting down and how much that hurt; on my birthday weekend. He told me he realizes what he did, but did not acknowledge my feelings. I got more upset the more he ignored it, culminating in me questioning his loyalties. He then demanded that I apologize to him. I told him I would not until he acknowledged how shutting someone out can make them feel as well as a real apology for taking his frustration out on my dog. The next day, I get a drawn out text in the morning saying he’s done with me and blocking me everywhere after this message; telling me “I get that you’re going through a hard time right now but he won’t be disrespected anymore.”

78,1e3w3r5,AITA for not cancelling my plans to dogsit,"So my bf(18m) and I(18f) were asked to dogsit for my sister(26f) and her fiance(31m). We will call them bil and sister. For context we take their dogs out a lot during the day because they often can't, sometimes I even have to leave work to do so. 

Before this all started we were out of town visiting my other sister(30f). We had specifically planned for this trip to end the day my bil left even though we were going to stay an extra week with my other sister. We were excited to stay over at their house for 2 weeks while they were out of town. They had set rules and bought us food to eat while we there. We had let them know that my parents were taking us out of town for the weekend for our family reunion, which all was fine. A few days after bil and sister had left we had realized that they were going to be gone for 3 weeks instead of 2. This caused a problem because we, me and bf, were going on another trip with our friends during that 3rd week. We didn't think to bring it up to bil and sister because it hadn't mattered before then, but they had known about it. It wasn't a secret or anything, everyone in the family knew we were planning this since August or September of last year. The trip had gotten finalized with dates in April, which is when the hotel was booked and the tickets were bought. Bil and sister had never given us real dates as to when they would be gone, all they would say is a couple weeks so everyone in the family had assumed that it was only 2. The plan for this trip was to have our friends stay the night before because they live about 20 minutes away from us and we didn't want to pick them up in the morning. We had texted my sister about our friends staying the night because 1 of the rules was no friends over past 10 pm, which we didn't have a problem with. She responded upset with us because we were leaving again even though we had asked someone else to stay over with them while we were gone. We were only going to be gone for those 2 days for the family reunion and for 3 days during the trip before they got back. I would have understood if sister had said no to having people stay the night so we had a back up plan for that. I had also talked to my mom because I was confused as to why they were upset that we were leaving. My sister had also talked to my mom and explained that she had thought that this was a last minute plan, not something we had been planning for almost a year. This morning we got a text basically saying that we needs to leave their house by 12 because they had someone else coming to stay with the dogs. Mind you one of these dogs needs 5 pills every morning. But we cleaned up the house, washed the sheets, washed the dishes, took the dogs out for the last time, got everything of ours out and left. We left at around 7:45 this morning and I don't think we will ever be invited back. AITA?

TLDR my sister kicked us out of her house for dogsitting because we had a trip that overlapped with it.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-15,"AITA for not cancelling my plans to dogsit So my bf(18m) and I(18f) were asked to dogsit for my sister(26f) and her fiance(31m). We will call them bil and sister. For context we take their dogs out a lot during the day because they often can't, sometimes I even have to leave work to do so. 

Before this all started we were out of town visiting my other sister(30f). We had specifically planned for this trip to end the day my bil left even though we were going to stay an extra week with my other sister. We were excited to stay over at their house for 2 weeks while they were out of town. They had set rules and bought us food to eat while we there. We had let them know that my parents were taking us out of town for the weekend for our family reunion, which all was fine. A few days after bil and sister had left we had realized that they were going to be gone for 3 weeks instead of 2. This caused a problem because we, me and bf, were going on another trip with our friends during that 3rd week. We didn't think to bring it up to bil and sister because it hadn't mattered before then, but they had known about it. It wasn't a secret or anything, everyone in the family knew we were planning this since August or September of last year. The trip had gotten finalized with dates in April, which is when the hotel was booked and the tickets were bought. Bil and sister had never given us real dates as to when they would be gone, all they would say is a couple weeks so everyone in the family had assumed that it was only 2. The plan for this trip was to have our friends stay the night before because they live about 20 minutes away from us and we didn't want to pick them up in the morning. We had texted my sister about our friends staying the night because 1 of the rules was no friends over past 10 pm, which we didn't have a problem with. She responded upset with us because we were leaving again even though we had asked someone else to stay over with them while we were gone. We were only going to be gone for those 2 days for the family reunion and for 3 days during the trip before they got back. I would have understood if sister had said no to having people stay the night so we had a back up plan for that. I had also talked to my mom because I was confused as to why they were upset that we were leaving. My sister had also talked to my mom and explained that she had thought that this was a last minute plan, not something we had been planning for almost a year. This morning we got a text basically saying that we needs to leave their house by 12 because they had someone else coming to stay with the dogs. Mind you one of these dogs needs 5 pills every morning. But we cleaned up the house, washed the sheets, washed the dishes, took the dogs out for the last time, got everything of ours out and left.

I am lecturer at summer academy for highschoolers. It's a professional summer camp, with variety of activities, and each lecturer leads a course (e.g. Medicine, Machine learning, Politics) with one lesson/day.

Before students' arrival on Sunday, there is ""preparation weekend"". We are all young people, usually few years after uni.  
Our community overall is doing multiple meetups during the year, we are all friends and know each other. This is my second time lecturing.

I got invited to friends' wedding on Saturday, so I would have to arrive to the prep. weekend on Sunday. It still doesn't mean I wouldn't teach my course, students arrive Sunday afternoon and all the program is starting on Monday. It means I wouldn't help with small preparation tasks on Saturday.

The academy has different ""bacthes"" during summer, each has different team of lecturers, each 9 days long.  
Each batch has two coordinators, \~10 lecturers, a doctor, and \~2 people for operations.

The coordinators are extremely upset that I want to arrive later.

AITA for wanting to go to the wedding?

More points with additional context:

PROS:

* There is another lecturer from our batch going to the same wedding! Plus another lecturer who leaves one day earlier for some other reason. Last year, there were also \~3 people arriving later.
* I asked 5 other people from the same organization (incl. the ""president"") what they think, and all said that they would pick the wedding.
* The coordinators are quite arrogant/ rude to me for no particular reason, because I tried to ask very politely, I offered to call about it, I tried my best to explain the perspective, and of course offered to help with more things. Given that the community is all friendly and it's voluntary unpaid activity being done in our free time, I think this is an overkill.
* The wedding date was announced AFTER we were distributed to the batches. If I knew about the wedding, I would apply for another batch.
* From my experience, there is not that much work that it would collapse if I went later. And I would feel stupid for missing the wedding while being somewhere where I don't utilize my time 100% and mostly chill and get to know each other. (And as I mentioned, it's \~15 people organizing it in total).
* I am active in the academy during the year, I was in a marketing team, so it's not like I don't care and just want to give the least possible effort.

CONS:

* Each ""batch"" of the whole academy is organized independently and the policies depend a lot on the two coordinators. So even if X other people think that I should do something, they can only share their opinion, but it's the coordinators of the batch who determine the vibes and rules.

Because I have a full-time job on top of doing theatre I have told myself that performing for me has to be about strengthening my art while also meeting new people and seeing who I work best with.

Back in April, I auditioned for a production of Matilda with a theatre company I had heard mixed reception about but I wanted to form my own opinion. I got offered ""featured adult ensemble."" I accepted it considering this will be a good way to meet new people and have a relaxed rehearsal process. May is when we are given a flow sheet of who sings what as well as instructions to be off-book for our first rehearsal. I checked my flow sheet and I found out there that my featured part was the Doctor (in Matilda, he has some lines at the beginning and sings half the opening number as a fun lil belty moment.) I was sorta excited for that moment so I made sure that I would be ready by the first rehearsal!

**Here is the drama**. Our first rehearsal was yesterday. Every person had an assigned seat with those name tents that also had your character's name. As I am walking in reading the names I find *someone else has the Doctor listed on their name tent*.

","***Background***



As the eldest daughter, I experienced adult responsibilities early.

I love my parents; they sacrificed so much to move from their homeland so my sister and I could have a better life and access to education.We've always had a rocky relationship and don't seem to connect fundamentally. Despite their own dreams and health challenges, they worked manual labor jobs for the majority of their lives to keep us in the country. This is a sacrifice that I have always been aware of and felt a responsibility to honor; from a young age, I worked to help financially, excelled in school to get scholarships. 

They have faced immense hardships, including disownment from their families,legal issues and abusive upbringings. Overwhelmed, my parents became depressed and complacent. They missed emails relating to my sister's college applications resulting in her missing out on opportunities and were slow to take the initiative to sort out ongoing  issues with our residence status. I took on many of their duties, and felt that no matter how often I told them I was stressed out with managing the family they would never really fully change.

***The Problem***

My parents are undocumented, which means they can't get stable, well-paying jobs. They struggle to manage our household finances, especially as they get older and can't do physically demanding work. I have been supporting them financially since high school as a waitress to now.

I hoped to support them until they recovered from debts, saved enough for legal status, and became independent. However, I've sacrificed a lot—missing out on typical teenage and college experiences, taking on responsibilities like attending my sister's parent-teacher conferences, and suffering academically due to burnout.

We've been experiencing intense family conflicts, leading me to stop sending money and reduce contact There wasn't a single triggering event—I'm just exhausted and overwhelmed by the constant hurt and complicated emotions. 

When I ask them what the long term plan is, they offer uncertain answers, simply saying they'll manage.

This isn't about money; it's about wanting parents who can manage their own lives. I desire for them to be happy and independent so I don’t have to worry constantly. I'm frustrated that I must put my life on hold indefinitely for their problems. As they age, their reliance on me will only increase. I've never had a year where I could focus solely on myself and set my own course without these pressure

I love them so much,despite everything that has happened I'm not at all angry at them.

We usually have a good time playing videos games and such, though this last time really just had my annoyance rising. 

We invited him on a Wednesday only planning for him to stay a couple nights which lead to that Monday to the entire week, then another week, then another without his dad ever asking for him back until this past weekend. He was asked back as it's been nearly three weeks at our house and his stepmom wanted to do back to school shopping early. 

Though plans changed and he ended up getting his dad to agree to let him back over another night. I was annoyed and frustrated, and made it clear with my sister who agreed with me to a point that we didn't want him back over. It's not that we don't like him or that we didn't have fun while he was over. It's just that when you are around someone for so long their flaws become more noticable. He likes to stay up very late and teases when I get tired or have to go to bed early cause of work. He sleeps in until very late the following days and tells you off if you try waking him for any reason. He also talks really loudly with his other friends on the phone until late in the night. And one of his main topics of conversations is about his relationship sexual life, which I don't want to hear.

Recently my dad has been more hostile toward me, repeatedly commenting on my appearance and diet. He said that I need to eat more (he eats a lot at meals and for snacks, whereas I eat a moderate portion), and he says that working out everyday is bad for my health. I just do 20 minutes of cardio and free weights mostly at home, but he says that too much exercising will ruin my body. He even scolds me when I occasionally skip a meal because I'm not that hungry.

Last night I was going to the basement to exercise, and my dad told me that I already exercised everyday for the past 6 days. I said that I like to workout daily, and he said that I am going to end up like my sister (18f), who developed an eating disorder in middle school and because of that is short and underweight up to this day (though she recovered around 9th grade). He said that for a long time she ate just 1 or 2 meals a day, and spends 2 to 3 hours exercising each day. (In fact I only skip a meal once in a while, and I exercise about 30 minutes per day). He kept saying that my behavior is unhealthy, and that I need to take a break from exercising and not obsess over my appearance I explained that I'm not obsessing over my appearance, but I just want to stay healthy and de-stress regularly, and maintain heart and lung strength. He still said that I am giving him flashbacks to when my sister had an eating disorder, and he said that he cannot repeat this mistake. He said that if his children have eating disorders, it reflects on his failures as a parent. I reiterated that I don't have body image issues, and that I just value physical fitness.

He kept lecturing and criticizing me, and finally I told him that he might just be jealous of my appearance because of how much he has been commenting on it lately. I said that if he wants to be healthy he should eat less and exercise a few times a week, and that it's better to be fit than overweight or underweight. He got really angry and said that he cares about me and doesn't want me to have disordered eating or body image issues, and that it's a red flag that I exercise every single day.

Last night I was going to the basement to exercise, and my dad told me that I already exercised everyday for the past 6 days. I said that I like to workout daily, and he said that I am going to end up like my sister (18f), who developed an eating disorder in middle school and because of that is short and underweight up to this day (though she recovered around 9th grade). He said that for a long time she ate just 1 or 2 meals a day, and spends 2 to 3 hours exercising each day. (In fact I only skip a meal once in a while, and I exercise about 30 minutes per day). He kept saying that my behavior is unhealthy, and that I need to take a break from exercising and not obsess over my appearance I explained that I'm not obsessing over my appearance, but I just want to stay healthy and de-stress regularly, and maintain heart and lung strength. He still said that I am giving him flashbacks to when my sister had an eating disorder, and he said that he cannot repeat this mistake. He said that if his children have eating disorders, it reflects on his failures as a parent. I reiterated that I don't have body image issues, and that I just value physical fitness.

He kept lecturing and criticizing me, and finally I told him that he might just be jealous of my appearance because of how much he has been commenting on it lately. I said that if he wants to be healthy he should eat less and exercise a few times a week, and that it's better to be fit than overweight or underweight. He got really angry and said that he cares about me and doesn't want me to have disordered eating or body image issues, and that it's a red flag that I exercise every single day. I said that I work out because I care about my health, not so much my appearance, and that if he was in shape he wouldn't have been so sore about it.",1.0,0.022675178945064545,0,0
86,1e3uef9,WIBTA for having a vegetarian only wedding?,"New to Reddit as I need opinions. 

My fiancé and I (both 30s) are getting married in a couple of months. We now need to finalise our menu choices for our guests. Now, we are vegetarian. In general, we are pretty relaxed vegetarians. If we go out, we totally don't mind if our friends/family choose meat or fish to eat, same if we visit family. As long as there is a veggie option, then great. Now back to the wedding. On looking at the choices, and given it's our day, we thought it would be nice to have a fully vegetarian menu. My (32F) parents are paying for the meal and have been absolutely stunned by this choice. They say it's disrepectful to people who aren't in the vegetarian culture, and also disrespectful to our own values in terms of ensuring our friends have a nice time. They say it's forcing our ethics on other people. My viewpoint is: it is one meal only, on our day, where I'm sure it will be delicious whatever they're served. None of our friends have ever complained when coming to our house for (vegetarian) food but my parents say it's different at a wedding because people ""expect luxury food"", especially if they are travelling from abroad (many are) and apparently this needs to include meat. I am honestly Natalie Imbruglia-d (torn) on this. Personally I don't mind that much if our guests eat meat but it is inconsistent with our own life choices and it is our day, so that could make it feel inauthentic. And I think the whole focus on meat thing is quite generational (my parents are in their 60s). My fiancé agrees with me but the issue is my parents are (very kindly) paying for the meal.

A fellow classmate sent a message to our public group chat (that had everyone in the course) addressing me, starting the message with “I don’t like confrontation” but then continued to type out a whole paragraph, instead of talking to me privately, stating that she had a panic attack in class today because of my fidget making a clicking sound. She also said in the message “I know you are neurodivergent and I can understand you needing this fidget as my son is also neurodivergent and he also likes his fidgets” (even tho I have never mentioned anything about me being neurodiverse) but then continues to tell me that I should stop using my fidget toy. Earlier in the day before she sent the message she mentioned that she was getting annoyed from people clicking their pens and others typing on their laptops yet singled me out for my supposed clicking noises saying I’m the only cause for her meltdown and not mentioning that any of the other noises that annoyed her during the day could have contributed to her meltdown as well. Should I stop using my fidget toy to accommodate to her or should I tell her no as this helps me stay focused and entertained in the class room?

90,1e3trbv,AITA for snapping at my kid’s dad in the clinic?,"My ex who is also my daughter's dad seems to like telling people socially that I'm ""a medical professional"". 
If I'm there I'll always set things straight, but I've also never actually told him afterwards to stop.

I'm actually a hospital clinic manager, more the numbers and systems side of things but also some processes. I started medical school decades ago but dropped out part way and went into research; my career since has been in healthcare but always on the data side of things.

Today we brought our kid to an orthodontist to ask about braces. Part way through the consult, he mentions that I ""know more about this kind of stuff"" than he does because I'm ""actually a medical professional"".

The dentist turns to me with interest and she says ""oh, are you a doctor?"". I start clarifying it, and he cuts in and says ""you actually went to medical school though"". I can see the dentist starting to ask another question about it, so I turn to him and snap ""Can we just drop it please"". So the dentist just moves on with the consult.

Later he explains that he was trying to make sure I was included in the discussion more as he felt she was directing her conversation more his way than mine. I hadn't gotten this impression, but all I said to him was that it's not worth mentioning in a consult because if they think you're in the profession they'll actually explain things less, so it's not an advantage.

What I didn't say, was that I was furious that he'd share my personal story with someone that we were in a professional setting with. It was not his place to bring my career up, and I was there to get professional advice not chat about my personal life.

I try to minimise what I say to him because we now have a purely co-parenting relationship after years of conflict, and he has a history of over-reacting and blowing things up so I always try to say as little as possible and only what's needed for co-parenting.

Because my priority with him is to avoid unnecessary drama, I'm not going to bring this up again. I know that things would be different if we could have the talk-things-out kind of relationship. 

But I want to know for myself - was I TA for snapping like that, or does he overstep?

I mean, the rule is says: Or you are going on a war, or you have disability or working on work that gives you a paper that you free from being military.

The story is: My father is electrician, and his work give papers that makes free for period that he is working ONLY IN OUR CITY. For a year we planned how to leave safe and buy a house in other country on money that we will get for selling our car. Even moms third pregnancy was planned. My brother is just ""instrument"" for leave, as my parents says. The last kid has been born because family's can leave Ukraine with 3 and more kids. Im turning 18 in September, that means my parents will have 2 kids and 1 adult(Oopsies, cant leave with those)

My family is poor, so pay money and get the right documents is not the solution. Before the May for my dad it was easy to get in military registration and give them all documents for have a paper for leave(As we thought). He was trying to get into this office, but he always was in queue to get there. Every week for three days as he said he need to go there for all work time, so that's mean he wont able to go to work. Dad is still going there.

But yesterday I find out that he is not going there. Dad got call from his friend, who called him in this moment that he leaved the house for going in military registration(He forgot the phone in home). I know that friend very good and after a talk with me he told that my dad is spending our money for drugs and for another woman. As he said before, the money that he spend was ""brides"" for people in registration who moved him further in queue. We was pretty stupid, huh?

Time is going, and my b-day is after 2 months. My dad told mother that: «Im first in queue today so im gonna get the documents after a week». But the truth was he even wasn't in queue, he wasn't there for about a month. Today is the third month that he is going ""there"" instead of work.

Today I said a lot of words to my dad how i hate him and how he ruined life his kids, before this moment I didn’t tell mom because I thought it was still easy to get the documents. As I found out today, recently our country boards closed for family's with 3 childrens. They open only if you have money now. That was the reason why I hate him now.

But now we even don't have money for food. I hate him so much, because after 2 months all ways will be closed. Even way with money.

I was working since 14 y.o. for paying for myself, but now Im working in home and I get very little money for work as an digital artist. All family is living on my money now that I was saving for college.

My parents cut ties with their families before I was born and moved to another state a few years after, so I didn’t have any grandparents/other relatives growing up.

Mom said they're going to file a claim but I should still help out as much as possible since they don't have much money and I know how to fix it all. My reasoning for not wanting to get involved is I'm already helping another family member with a major renovation, I'm still coaching my son's baseball team and will likely be coaching basketball when baseball ends, I'm not close with my aunt and uncle, the home in question is over an hour drive from my house, and my aunt and uncle have never offered me any help when I've needed it. I explained further that while I'm capable of making these repairs I'm not a contractor or structural engineer.

I understand that making a material list wouldn't be a horrible job but still beyond what I want to volunteer myself for. I also understand mom's point of saying I should help family in a time of need. 

So AITA for not volunteering any of my time to help repair my aunt and uncle's home?",0.0,0.05329415947198868,0,1

I'm not saying that alone makes it okay I just mean that it's not like they're going to work or school in the morning.

I work from home all day and sometimes all night. My sleep schedule is all over the place. This isn't ideal but it's what happens especially as I have hard deadlines. 

Often I will be up at some weird hour and I need to eat something. I go into the kitchen which isn't next to anyone's room and try to quietly get a slice of bread and I boil water and make a cup of tea. I close the kitchen door but still noise will come out. 

My roommate who is downstairs below my bedroom complained about being able to hear me walk and making some noise. They are extremely sensitive to sound so I try to walk quietly. I only make noise for about 3min to grab bread, drizzle some honey, make my tea and try to tiptoe back to my room.

He comes upstairs and gets mad at me complaining about the noise. I refused to stop as I feel I'm being as quiet as possible and not cooking or spending more than a few min doing it. 

The other 3 roommates don't have an issue with it and say I'm quiet enough. They have said it isn't much more noise or disturbance than when someone gets up to go to the washroom.

I feel bad that my roommate downstairs is annoyed but I have refused to change my behaviour.

This roommate also refuses to wear earplugs as they are uncomfortable for them. To me if you are very noise sensitive, I feel for you but that's on you.

95,1e3shi5,AITA for refusing to see my wife's friend on my birthday?,"So my wife (25f) and I (25m) are going to her hometown for a week over my birthday. The reason for this is because my wife (let's call her Tina) has a friend (friend A) who just gave birth, and Tina wants to visit her and help out. I'm on good standing with friend A, so this isn't an issue with me.
 
 Here lies the issue. While we're in Tina's hometown, she wants to go to another town with myself and her mom to see friend B (fake name Brian). Bit of back story. Tina and brian were both heavy into hard drugs in the past, and since Tina and I first started dating, Tina and Brian have gotten clean. The problem is, in the early days, Brian let Tina relapse by offering their drug of choice.

 Because of this (and another reason I don't wanna say due to too much identifying information), I hate Brian. I don't mind if Tina wants to stay in contact with him. It's her choice, and it's not my place to say who Tina can and can't have as friends. That being said, Tina told me that Brian wanted to talk with me to apologize. I've told Tina that I don't want to ever see Brian ever again.

 Tina keeps saying that it would be good for Brian's recovery, but I don't care. I told Tina that "" I don't  mind if you want to keep your friendship with Brian, but don't expect me to want to have anything to do with him."" she understood and told me that's fine, but she still wants to go to (city) and see him. I told her that it's fine. I could either drop her and my MIL off and do my own thing, or I'll give them the car and they can drop me off somewhere while they go see Brian, but I absolutely refuse to meet with him period. 

To Tina's credit, they do have a bad memory. And the other day, while going home from my parents' place, Tina told me that for my birthday, we were gonna spend the day in (city) and go see Brian while we're at it. I got upset and told Tina that "" not only do I not want to spend my birthday in (city). I sure as shit don't wanna spent it with Brian"". She apologized and said, ""I'm sorry I forgot. We can go do that another day while we're there. "" 

 The trip is still a week out, and I'm getting nervous. It's not that I don't trust Tina, but Brian has been known to lie to get their way before. Call it paranoia, but my gut is telling me that something feels off and to not trust him. So am I the asshole for refusing to meet with my wife's friend?

Edit: fake names rather than letters, spelling, and punctuation.

Edit 2: for clarification. Tina is going through treatment for her addiction. With witnessed drug tests. We're working on getting her in a support group. She's also going through therapy to help her with the mental side effects of being manipulated for so long, and by people she should have been able to trust. She had cut alot of people out of her life to get off drugs. Also the time span between her asking was months. It wasn't the next day.

96,1e3sejc,AITA for refusing to have my friends dog over the weekend?,"So I have a friend, we’ll call her A. 
A has 3 pets, 2 cats and a dog. She can’t have her cats live with her due to allergies in the  home so they’ve been living with me and my own cat for about 8 months. She buys the food (just for her cats which is fair) and cat litter which all the cats use

A’s dog is very poorly, in heart failure at the moment. She’s on a strict routine of a lot of medications and supplements, and a strict diet, and has to be taken outside for toilets roughly every couple of hours, sometimes more.

I’ve had her through the day and overnight every time I’ve been asked, sometimes for multiple days, sticking to the medication food and toilet routine to the letter. So overall I take full responsibility for all of her animals 100% of the time I’m asked to.

Over the time I’ve had A’s cats, I’ve had to go away a few times, and the agreement was she would come and feed them and my cat too. But 4 out of 5 times, she hasn’t, despite saying she would. They’ve been left for 3 days sometimes because she ‘works too much and is too tired’ to go and feed them.

Both myself and my partner have been seriously upset by this every time it’s happened, as I’m sure you can agree is understandable, pets are a responsibility you can’t just not bother with because you’re too tired. I’m often very tired when looking after her dog but I never miss anything she needs. 

Last weekend, A rang me. She kept saying how she’s going away for the weekend and dropping hints that she wasn’t sure of who can have the dog. I stay quiet because my partner was planning to come over for the weekend and I knew he’d have a lot to say if he turned up and the dog was there, as he keeps saying I shouldn’t have her dog when she doesn’t look after the cats.

So she gets to the point where she asks me if I can have her. I say sorry no not this time. She asks why. So I explain. And it all kicks off. She’s not happy. She says my partner is an asshole and that she’s not a c**t, she was ill one time and working 80 hours the next (there’s been at least 4 times she’s not bothered). She says it bears no context to me looking after her dog. 

I might be the asshole because realistically I could have had her dog and told my partner to mind his business, I might not be because I do think it has context and everyone in my life I’ve mentioned it to has immediately brought up how she doesn’t feed and water the cats

98,1e3s5av,AITA for cussing my aunt then refusing to apologize after she found out that i did,"Hi,

First off, please excuse my English since it's my second language. I have a situation (17M) and don't know if I should apologize for what I did. This story goes back a year.

For context, my dad isn't the best, but I love him. My mom's side of the family dislikes my dad because he insists we be home by 10 PM, while they stay out till 3 AM. My youngest aunt (Y.A.) has a problem where she lashes out when angry or stressed, almost like she's possessed.

A year and a half ago, my sister and I stayed at my favorite aunt's house for a week without asking my dad, who had planned a vacation for us.

During Ramadan, my dad hosted iftar for both sides of the family. Everything was smooth until my dad and aunts discussed our curfew. Suddenly, Y.A. lashed out, saying, ""I hope one day one of your daughters gets treated just like how you're treating our sister."" I was deeply hurt. Y.A. eventually passed out and was taken home. My dad got angry and shouted at my aunts, especially my favorite aunt, before going to bed.

After this drama, my favorite aunt distanced herself from us. I began resenting Y.A., blaming her for our strained family relationships.

Now to the main issue. I began talking to my 16-year-old cousin, my favorite aunt's daughter, whom I had a crush on for two years. It's normal for cousins to marry in our country. After confessing my feelings, we started a relationship. Her older brother and aunts found out, and we were told to stop, which we did temporarily. We continued talking secretly, but I became too stressed with final exams and the secrecy.

One day, I came home to find Y.A. and another aunt, who knew about my relationship. They made jokes about it, which hurt. Y.A. talked to my sister privately, but she wouldn't tell me what was discussed. Frustrated, I called Y.A. a derogatory name to my cousin.

A week or two later, I told my cousin I couldn't continue the relationship due to stress, and we stopped talking. At a family dinner, Y.A. brought gifts for my sister's birthday. I jokingly asked where mine was, and she replied, ""Don't talk to me, I'm disappointed in you."" I found out my cousin's dad had shown Y.A. our messages.

While on vacation, my mom told me Y.A. saw the messages and was hurt. She suggested I apologize. I was angry, feeling it's Y.A.'s fault our family is distant.

99,1e3rx9m,AITA for fixing a problem so my cousin could bake a cake?,"My family has a tradition of spending the week of Memorial Day together on a vacation property that's jointly owned by several family members. It includes a day-long picnic/cookout that involves 8-20 family members.

While discussing logistics, my cousin Jesse (22F) announced that she was going to bake a cake. Immediately, our aunt Beatrice (73F) became insistent that Jesse NOT make this cake. She'd have to bake it the day before, but there wasn't anywhere to store it. She shot down any and all ideas from Jesse and her mom, Marie (51F).

When I (38F) spoke to Jesse later, she confided in me that she felt ""stupid"" for buying the cake ingredients already because she knew Beatrice would find an excuse to stop her from making it. She really wanted to contribute this year because - despite being an adult with a full time job - everyone still treated her like she was a kid who couldn't be trusted to do anything. She wanted to prove them wrong.

I reminded her that Beatrice's concerns were about the lack of safe food storage, NOT about trust in Jesse's abilities, but she wasn't buying that. TBH, I thought Beatrice's arguments were flimsy at best. However, as a preteen/teen, I spent a few summers Beatrice's family to attend a cool summer camp with my cousin Conner (38M) who was born the same year as me. And during this time, I came to resent Beatrice. It was like she would say ""no"" to us with no reason, basically just so we'd know she's boss. For example, at breakfast, she'd ask what I wanted to drink, only to insist I needed to drink something else. Ask for milk? No, you have to have OJ. Ask for OJ? No, milk. She'd do this with everything; it was especially annoying when it came to activities. Anyway, I am an adult now, and am able to admit my view of her is definitely bias, so I didn't say anything to Jesse about it.

Instead, I looked at the problem: the tiny countertop. I realized that while there was limited horizontal space, there was plenty of vertical space, especially over the snack bowl area, which wasn't big enough to serve as a prep area anyway. And that gave me an idea.

So, the next morning, I measured twice and went out to quest for a pantry stand (stuff can go under it, and it gives a little 'shelf' to put stuff above), and found one that fit over the snack bowl. I showed it to Marie when I got back and got her permission to set it up. And Jesse was able to bake her cake.

Beatrice was NOT pleased by this development, sulking and rolling her eyes whenever the cake was mentioned. 

Several cousins have since accused me of being an AH here because it ""wasn't my place"" to fix the space issue, as it wasn't really the problem, and I should've known she didn't actually want me to fix it. I maintain that Beatrice shouldn't have lied about what the problem was to begin with.

Kate moved an hour away (I offered quite a few times to go there, she was never available), Rachel never wanted to meet because she was always tired from work. They plates sport together or other things but could never meet up (at that point I  was the only friend them had left because of different things, so they weren't meeting other people).

I still tried to keep in touch and whenever they said to meet I would say yes. They were late 90% of the times (by over 40 minutes). Around 2020 and 2021 I was suffering really bad from depression and I asked them for their suport, just to meet sometimes and haver fun so I could distract myself. They never could.

Eventually I met my future husband, ""Tom"" (38f). We fell in love and he asked me to marry me. At this point I hadn't seen Kate in 2 years and Rachel in 1. So I didn't know if to invite them or not (we are having a small wedding).

A few days ago Kate sent me a message asking about muy life. They heard I was getting married. Kate was fishing for info but eventually told me ""I supoose if you haven't told us you are getting married we aren't invited lol""

I just said that we were still doing the wedding list and that we didn't know because it was going to be mostly family (all completely true at this point). Well, shit hit the fan here, because she started ranting on how she had put up with me for years and how dare I not tell them and invite them (I literally don't know what she meant by ""putting Up"" with me, honestly, I try to be as drama free as possible and can be quite a pushover sometimes)

I just answered that I haven't seen or heard from them in years, so I didn't know if I wanted them in a small wedding with family and close friends.

Apparently that was a mistake, she called me crazy, desperate, that I didn't know how to be single (I was single by choice for over 10 years so I don't know what she was talking about), a selfish bitch...oh, and that me and my future ""crazy"" husband should go fuck ourselves.

I took screenshots and blocked her. Now her sister, Rachel, is asking me to forgive her because she got upset and talked to me the way she does to her she they fight. 

Obvioulsy I'm not inviting her now, but AITA for not telling them that I was getting married and inviting them from the start?

101,1e3roy7,AITA for telling my mom that she's a bad mom and that she shouldn't have another child ?,"My mom is 44 yo, she has been divorced from my father since 20 years. Recently she found herself a +50yo man who has never been married and don't have any child. Apparently, between them, it was love at first sight and because of that, she wants to marry him and give him a kid, but  they really wouldn't make good parents and i don't wanna see another child live what i lived.

So, when my mom met my dad, it wasn't really working good between them. They didn't really like each other at first but no one wanted either of them so they gave it a shot. My mom has a disability that weakens her pretty much, so at the time she was scared she couldn't have children when older and insisted to my dad that she wanted kids ASAP, and he said yes even if he, originally, didn't want any kids. But with conviction and stuff, i was born. Fast forward to when we were 10 and 8yo. My parents divorced a while ago and we go time to time at my father's who's, to say it simply, is a bad father. He treats us like shit and, sometimes, to act like he's sorry, he buy us gifts. My mother knows all of it very well, but don't do anything. Two years later, my mom decides she can't live where we used to anymore, knowing how our father acted, she decided to leave, alone, while leaving us with him. She left and made us change our whole way to live and leave our friends to go live with our dad. We did live with him for 4 years. During those 4 years, i was bullied and kinda started to understand that my mom was ashamed of being a girl and that herself was sexist against her own gender, and it became even more obvious when she thought that any men could have lust upon me, even the ones of my own family. My brother, on his side, became more and more dangerous. Growing up, he started acting very dangerously with random girls, but my mom laughed it off, to the point of him getting sued didn't even make her react.

At my 16, my mom took us back with her. She sees very well that the time at my father's didn't have the best impact on her children. Her daughter is depressed and her son is showing signs of psychopathy. Still, she encouraged his toxic behavior by taking a loan to buy him expensive stuff. 

The last time i thought she might maybe be a good mom was when i told her i had an abortion, i was 17, and she called my bf family, when we told her that initially we wanted to keep that private because it was hard enough.

In the other hand, we have the guy who showed really weird behavior. For example, my mom adopted one of my cousins from cameroon. And the dude agreed about that, she told him and he was okay. And still he acts with this poor child like he's a leper or something. He's annoyed as everything he does and it's almost like he avoids him.

They know this about me, I've done it for a long time. I'm not rich or anything, the opposite. I'm a student with two part-time jobs in a big city.

However, we were going to purchase train tickets, me, my little sister and two cousins. I offered to pay and insisted I pay for their train tickets. My cousin sad their mom (my aunt) got it so don't worry, but as I am always, I asked to please take the money. I then got a text my aunt was mad at me by my cousin and that it wasnt a good idea.

My mom called me now and gave me a long rant about how I need to be careful and to not damage relationship I have with my aunt. Apparently she was pissed off and it was disrespectful of me to send money to her as if I'm insinuating my aunt cant afford it and that I have to stop exaggerating. She said I went out of line.

I am upset by this turning into me being disrespectful and it was such a harsh call for me offering money as I always do and have done.

Alright, buckle up because this is going to be a long one. I'm (19M) dealing with some serious drama right now, and I really need an outside perspective to figure out if I'm being a jerk here.



So, here’s the background: I’ve been best friends with this guy, Jake (19M), since middle school. We’ve been through everything together—awkward phases, first crushes, you name it. We even decided to go to the same college because we thought it would be awesome to stick together. Big mistake, apparently.



Fast forward to last semester. Jake and I both ended up joining the same fraternity. At first, it was all good vibes, parties, and brotherhood. But then shit started to get weird. There was this one night, at a party, where Jake hooked up with this girl, Emma (18F), who I had a massive crush on since forever. I hadn’t told Jake about my feelings for Emma because, well, I was stupid and thought he might just pick up on it.



The next morning, I decided to finally man up and tell Jake how I felt about Emma. He seemed cool about it and promised me he wouldn’t pursue anything with her. I thought that was the end of it. Spoiler alert: it wasn’t.



Over the next few weeks, I noticed Jake and Emma hanging out more and more. I asked him about it, and he swore they were just friends. But then, I found out through the grapevine (and by that I mean Instagram stories and Snapchat) that they were definitely more than friends. They were hooking up regularly and even going out on dates.



I felt like a fucking idiot. I confronted Jake about it, and he just shrugged it off like it was no big deal. He said he didn’t think I was serious about Emma and that he really liked her. I was beyond pissed, but I tried to keep my cool and told him I felt betrayed. Jake apologized but then had the nerve to say, “Bro, you should’ve told me sooner. You snooze, you lose.”



At this point, I was done trying to be the bigger person. I went to a mutual friend, Mike (20M), and told him everything. Mike was just as shocked and pissed as I was. We decided to call Jake out on his bullshit at the next fraternity meeting. When we did, Jake tried to play the victim, saying we were ganging up on him and making a big deal out of nothing.



Things escalated quickly. The fraternity split into two sides—those who thought Jake was in the wrong and those who thought I was overreacting. The whole thing turned into a massive shitshow, and now there’s this huge rift in the fraternity. People are taking sides, friendships are getting ruined, and the whole vibe is just toxic as hell.



To top it all off, Emma found out about the drama and now she’s pissed at both Jake and me. She said she doesn’t want to be caught up in our “bro drama” and has been avoiding us like the plague. So now I’ve lost my shot with Emma, my best friend, and the   frat.

107,1e3p6v0,AITA for suggesting to demote my fiancé's sister as my bridesmaid and uninvite her from the wedding along with their dad?,"I, 28F, am engaged to my fiancé Grant, 30M and we are getting married this year. Grant's sister Lizzie, is the drama center of the family. She cant exist without something going on and its honestly like living in a soap opera. Its exhausting and tbh, we normally just avoid her. Im a school councillor and worked with one child in particular, Lizzies's friends daughter Sarah. Sarah had a really hard childhood and did not attend school often, I did my best to make her feel comfortable and went out my way to try and help her back into education. The details aren't important, but I tried my hardest for her and anyone near the situation, knows that. One day Lizzie and Sarah's mom, Katy, got drunk and started trashing me at a friend's wedding. They said I caused Sarah to stop attending school and that I ruined her education. I know that is not the case as Sarah was already not attending school before I started and I had a really positive relationship with her. She just had huge barriers that she couldnt overcome, despite our best efforts. This whole thing really hurt my feelings because of how hard I worked for Sarah and it felt like a stab in the back. It was bs and came from nowhere. A few days later I apptoached Lizzie and Katy and they both denied everything. I had (sober) witneses but they both called me a liar and said that I'm making up crap to make them look bad, total gaslighting. This is not the first time that Lizzie has done stuff like this and Im sure that it won't be the last. Grants dad, Randall, is already not attending our wedding and from the bottom of my heart I want rid of Lizzie too but I don't want to make things any harder on my fiancé. Plus his other sisters and brother have roles so I don't want to put anyone in an awkward position of potentially having to choose a side. Am I being unreasonable to want to ask her to step down? I just don't want any drama on our day. Background on Randall- we have a limited relationship and he was never a good parent to Grant. He was invited because it's his dad but not out of love from either of us. One day Randall called me and demanded to have his name added to the invitations and have them resent, he wanted certain special privileges on the day too including a seat at the top table, mentions in speeches and to be in all the family photos. I told him that these decisions are my fiancé's to make and he then gave us an ultimatum- we accept his demands or he doesn't attend our wedding.

AITA for not wanting either Randall or Lizzie to attend?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-15,"AITA for suggesting to demote my fiancé's sister as my bridesmaid and uninvite her from the wedding along with their dad? I, 28F, am engaged to my fiancé Grant, 30M and we are getting married this year. Grant's sister Lizzie, is the drama center of the family. She cant exist without something going on and its honestly like living in a soap opera. Its exhausting and tbh, we normally just avoid her. Im a school councillor and worked with one child in particular, Lizzies's friends daughter Sarah. Sarah had a really hard childhood and did not attend school often, I did my best to make her feel comfortable and went out my way to try and help her back into education. The details aren't important, but I tried my hardest for her and anyone near the situation, knows that. One day Lizzie and Sarah's mom, Katy, got drunk and started trashing me at a friend's wedding. They said I caused Sarah to stop attending school and that I ruined her education. I know that is not the case as Sarah was already not attending school before I started and I had a really positive relationship with her. She just had huge barriers that she couldnt overcome, despite our best efforts. This whole thing really hurt my feelings because of how hard I worked for Sarah and it felt like a stab in the back. It was bs and came from nowhere. A few days later I apptoached Lizzie and Katy and they both denied everything. I had (sober) witneses but they both called me a liar and said that I'm making up crap to make them look bad, total gaslighting. This is not the first time that Lizzie has done stuff like this and Im sure that it won't be the last. Grants dad, Randall, is already not attending our wedding and from the bottom of my heart I want rid of Lizzie too but I don't want to make things any harder on my fiancé. Plus his other sisters and brother have roles so I don't want to put anyone in an awkward position of potentially having to choose a side. Am I being unreasonable to want to ask her to step down? I just don't want any drama on our day. Background on Randall- we have a limited relationship and he was never a good parent to Grant. He was invited because it's his dad but not out of love from either of us. One day Randall called me and demanded to have his name added to the invitations and have them resent, he wanted certain special privileges on the day too including a seat at the top table, mentions in speeches and to be in all the family photos. I told him that these decisions are my fiancé's to make and he then gave us an ultimatum- we accept his demands or he doesn't attend our wedding. Bearing in mind he's contributed nothing to either of our lives other than negativity and has helped towards the wedding in no way, I was happy with the latter but tried to be the bigger person and said my fiance will be making that decision.

108,1e3p2uw,AITA for asking when a good time to vacuum would be? ,"My sister & I share an apartment. We get along great, most of the time, however cleaning is a sore spot for us and it took a long time to figure out a system that works for us. I like to keep it pretty spotless, while she is happy to have crap all over the place. 
As of now, I do most of the cleanup, while she tries to tidy up after herself & contributes a couple times a week at most. 
The worst thing is the vacuuming, as she NEVER does it, and when I do it, she doesn’t like me to use the ‘big’ vacuum (as opposed to the stick) as it somehow  ‘bothers her allergies’?!

Anyway, we’ve been going well for a long time now, but tonight I noticed that the carpet is really bad, super dirty with a lot of crumbs up the hallway. I like to vacuum when she’s not home, but she said she’ll be home everyday this week till Thursday, which is a long time to leave it. 

I really didn’t want an argument, so I chose my words really carefully and asked her “what would be a good compromise for when I can vacuum, since it’s a long time till Thursday?”

She immediately just said “you’re getting a bit high and mighty”. 
She seems to think that since she cleaned the kitchen once this week (mostly her own stuff, never mind the countless times I pick up after her) that I shouldn’t have even asked that question, but I thought I raised it very thoughtfully? I wasn’t accusing her, I wasn’t asking her to vacuum, I just wanted it done and wondered when a good time to do it would be.

110,1e3o0ik,AITA for telling my mom she’s not entitled to my life news?,"My mom was gossiping about me with my sister, at a party I couldn’t attend. She thought I was back with my ex and was asking my sister for information. My sister told her ‘if you wanna know anything about her life, ask OP’, but somehow also confirmed it was true. 

2 days after the party and after my birthday, mom messages me a long message talking about how I don’t have to keep him secret or hide him from conversations. She spilled some family gossip about my grandparents that they wouldn’t want out, and compared my relationship to hers and her alcoholic partner. 

I explained in a response that I am an intensely private person, and as we only text once a month for her to update me on which family member has which illness, or which items are coming on sale in a specific store, there is no perfect place to add the info about my relationship status in. Pair that with the fact she never asks how I am or anything about me, and it means it’s not something I would volunteer. (I have been waiting for her to ask how I am for the past 6 months so I can tell her I’m pregnant) 

Growing up, everything came at a price with her - we were never loved by her, she never told us she loved us, school shoes etc were part of our birthdays or we would have to do chores to pay for them. She would body shame me constantly, she herself was a woman of size and I wasn’t that big back then - just average puppy fat 9-14 year old.

She has no idea about my adult life as she never asks - she knows more about distant cousins who overshare their lives, or customers of hers, than she does about her youngest daughter.  

Following my response, she deactivated her fb account where she would message me from. I sent her a WhatsApp saying “I’m not sure why you deactivated your account. I guess I will speak to you in October when your granddaughter will be born.

It was easy at first, we were having a smooth sailing but he has a bit of a financial situation going on from a long time. He has a business which isn’t not going so well for a long time, him and his family have been pouring money and time into it and now they have  decided to sell it. It has been a really hard thing for them to, understandable. He has been really stressed about it but haven’t talked to me about it in open and I was unaware that it had been effecting him this much, I always had to detect something was wrong through a mood shift, or a tone switch which always made me think that I might have said or done something wrong. Yesterday, he finally decided to put everything on the table but not in a good way. The way he spoke was very hurtful and said some things like my problems being mindless yet his were genuine and couldn’t be ignored. I agree to his situation being a major one at this moment but it doesn’t sit right with me to be ridiculed. Our families are a little conservative and it is hard to get married to the person of your choosing and my mother doesn’t know he is not just my best friend anymore and she also doesn’t have a very high opinion of him. It doesn’t matter to me what she thinks but he is very bothered about it. So, all these things simultaneously happening has led him to believe that I might think of him as a failure now, his financial situation has made his father go into depression and he says that I made him weak by making him believe throughout that sharing your problems or talking about them makes you strong when it doesn’t. I tried talking to him but whatever I said he thinks that I was just saying these things to cover up my mistakes which now has made me confused as to how to talk to him. 
He said I want to be strong for myself and he doesn’t want me to worry about him. He just wants me to understand and let him deal with it without being emotional about the situation. I am very confused on how to carry our relationship forward with this situation. I want to be there for him but not feel unloved or disrespected by him throughout this situation. Help.

112,1e3nujs,AITA for telling him to get a job?,"Last night my boyfriend (25m) and I (25f) got into an argument because I didn’t feel like we had been spending much quality time together recently. He doesn’t have a job and stays at home all day playing a game called ‘League of Legends’ and he often plays it while I’m at home as well (we live together). This makes me very frustrated as I don’t understand why he prefers to play instead of spending time with me, when he already gets to play all day while I’m at work.

His behaviour also makes me worried that he won’t be financially responsible in the future since he is just playing games all the time. I told him to get a job and that he can’t just play non-stop and that I don’t want to have a child with a man who is just gaming all day every day. This made him feel hurt and that I don’t respect him or the way he spends his time and he said I was just being mean to him. He also argued that he spends plenty of time with me and that I just don’t see or appreciate when we do spend quality time together. He said even though he has no job, he still wants some time to himself when I’m at the flat.

Worth noting: he says he is financially stable despite having no job, but to be honest I don’t trust what he says…

113,1e3nhxn,AITA for refusing to let my parents borrow my cat?,"I'm a 22-year-old guy, and I live with my parents. I'm on my summer break from college. Since I was around 10, my mom would lease a new car every three years. Four years ago when I turned 18, she purchased the car that she had been leasing, as the lease was nearing its expiration, and gave the car to me, then leased a new one for herself. The car she currently has is the same make, model, and even color as my car, only three years newer, and it has a some features that my car doesn't have (heated seats and steering wheel, blind spot monitor, park assist, etc.), but one feature that my car has which hers doesn't is a NAV system. An important thing to note is that when she gave me the car, she transferred the title to me, so the car is mine, not hers.

I love my car and especially the NAV system, and use it all the time. I have a lot of trouble with reading maps, so being able to see where I am in real time is nice. Plus, since it's not on my phone, I don't have to worry about using up my data, or finding a place to mount the phone so that it isn't in the way but where I can still clearly see it. Plus my phone is rather old and tends to lag. My mom likewise is very happy with her car, and when the lease expired last year, she decided to purchase it. That's how happy she was with her car.

Which is why I was surprised when earlier today, my mom asked if she could borrow my car for a trip they will be taking next month in which they plan to drive to various states and stop at various tourist attractions along the way (not saying where we live or where they'll be going but it's in the southwestern US, so it will entail a lot of driving). They will be gone for three weeks. They want to take my car because it has the NAV system. I told them no, because I need my car. They insisted that I can get by for three weeks without the NAV system. I told them that I will need the NAV system, because during the time they will be gone, I have a doctors appointment in another city where I've never been, and I was also planning a short trip of my own with some friends to see a concert, and I said we could take my car because NAV system, and I also promised to be the designated driver.

My mom said that I can use the NAV system on my phone, and in the meantime, I can enjoy the features on her car that my car doesn't have, and my dad said that I can also drive his car. He has an older yet very nice car which has a lot of sentimental value to me that I enjoy driving, but I still need the NAV system in my car. Plus I'm not sure either of my parents would want me driving around a bunch of drunk, sweaty guys in either of their cars. I told them that they can use the NAV systems on *their* phones. I also reminded my mom that I am the legal owner of my car, as the title is in my name.

We argued for a while but eventually my mom reluctantly agreed that they would be going in their car. But now I'm thinking that maybe I should have allowed them to use my car.

116,1e3mwls,AITA Over My Baby Name Suggestions?,"I (28f) am 8 months pregnant with my wife, Ella (26f) and I's first child. A little background, my family has a tradition where the eldest daughters have an alternating pattern of two letters that begin their first name (for example, Vivian-Tessa-Violet-Tory). My wife's family has a tradition that the eldest girl's name ends with a certain four letters (we'll go with -ella for an example).

My wife has been vetoing my name suggestions left and right for the entire 4 months we've known that we're having a girl. I've suggested everything I can think of from my tradition with my wife saying no to every one of them except ones she knows I absolutely despise before redirecting me to names from her own family's tradition.

The issue is there are no names between our two traditions that would actually work, with a very limited number of names actually being names in the first place. What we have to work with are names that look like amalgamations of two names. (Think of something on the lines of Veronicella.) It's gotten to where I tried to suggest a name last week and she cut me off on the first syllable and suggested names from her own tradition instead.

My suggestions are not outrageous either, they're very normal names, maybe a few of them a bit out there but nothing too unusual. And I'm not unreasonable, I understand that we'll honor both traditions, but both cannot fit in the first name together without being some amalgamation of a normal name with her family's tradition stuck on at the end. I've tried suggesting having one of our traditions be the middle name and she's turned that down and told me to stick to my own family's tradition and she'll stick to hers.

Two days ago, I suggested a name I'd been holding off on suggesting because I really liked it, and I knew it would hurt to have it vetoed like I knew she would, since I've liked that name since I was a kid. She told me that the name was ""disgusting and awful and she would never agree to it over her dead body"". She then went off on me, yelling at me that she regrets going through everything to have a baby with me because, in her own words, ""You're becoming a real bitch about these stupid baby names. I should name the baby alone anyway, since you're the one who carried it, to make the marriage is even.""

She then just stopped talking to me and left for her brother's house over an hour away. I tried to text her this morning once I was certain we'd both have calmed down, asking why I wasn't allowed to have an opinion on our daughter's name, but she didn't read or respond to it. We have a deadline of 4 weeks until our daughter comes out, and she won't even talk to me at all. Our mutual friend group doesn't want to touch the discussion with a ten-foot pole and say it's between me and my wife.

So Reddit, AITA for wanting to have an opinion in our daughter's name, or am I overstepping since I'm the one who's pregnant and she's not and just let her get the name as her own decision?

**Edit for all those suggesting it:** I've tried to suggest names outside of tradition that I like, but they've also been shot down and the suggestion of breaking tradition has been met with, in her own words, ""We have to follow tradition, that's just how it is. Don't be stupid. That's the dumbest suggestion yet."" I'm willing to not do tradition names and even have a whole list of names that aren't of either naming tradition that I would happily pick from instead, but she has consistently vetoed every name on that list as well and told me to follow tradition.

**Edit 2 to answer consistent notes in the comments:**

**1) Communication issue:** Me and Ella did extensively talk through potential name issues before TTC with the agreement in place that we would drop tradition-based names entirely if either of us couldn't agree on a name. We were on the same page going into this pregnancy. This agreement seems to have changed for Ella once we found out it was a girl.

**2) Starting a tradition of our own:** I can't tell her we could start a tradition of our own instead of either family tradition/dropping tradition-based names at this point with her cutting off contact with me She is not being reasonable at this point and she won't even respond or pick up a call from me.

**3) Parentage:** Yes, I'm the only biological parent. No, she has no blood ties to my daughter. Also, we're both women unlike what some comments suggest of us. I am the one carrying the child, not her.

**4) Ella having resentment of me being the one pregnant:** Ella had a full hysterectomy a year before we started TTC. She does not want to get pregnant herself. Period. She knew full well going into the TTC journey with me that I would be the one pregnant, not her, as she has no means of carrying a child.

**5) Traditions are dumb/suck/stupid/meant to be broken:** Yeah, I know. Thus why I suggested ditching them in the first place.

Over two years later, she still hasn’t paid him back. My father has been patient, reminding her every few weeks, but she keeps promising to pay by the end of the week and then doesn’t follow through, often blaming her bank for mistakes.

I decided to step in since my father wasn’t being very proactive. I started emailing Madhu on June 10. She initially asked for time until June 22 to make the payment, but that didn’t happen. She made more promises to pay by the end of the day or week, but those fell through as well. After more than three weeks of this, I told her if she didn’t pay up soon, I’d reach out to one of her colleagues for help.

Madhu said she tried to pay via PayPal but ran into problems with the payment size. We agreed to split it into five parts, but she claimed PayPal still didn’t work for her. She then suggested a wire transfer, but after seven business days, my bank still hasn’t received it. I asked her to send confirmation of the wire transfer from her bank, but she said her bank hadn’t emailed it and refused to give her a printout. She even mentioned that the general manager of her bank had a family emergency, which is why she couldn’t get confirmation. Just everything she says sounds so elaborate to continue with excuses to not pay.

120,1e3m6wl,AITA for REFUSING to see my boyfriend’s mom again? ,"I (17 F) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (17 M) for nearly 2 years. I’ve spent a lot of time with his family, including both parents and his massive extended family. They all seemed to like me a lot and he had reassured that the family loved me, however I always had a gut feeling that his mother (50 F) didn’t. I brought gifts with me whenever I visited and always made sure to be extremely respectful to her and the family whenever I was there, until his mother began targeting me after realizing that I wasn’t going to be leaving her sons life. 

For background information, his parents have always held him to high standards academically, often pushing him into classes well beyond his limits in order to please them. He failed a test for one of these classes a few months ago and his parents didn’t seem to care. 3 weeks passed after this failed-test and our birthdays came up, his mother decided the night before my birthday party that he was indefinitely grounded and not allowed to see me. We suspected that she did this because of jealousy over not being invited to my birthday, however the invite was open for everyone in both our immediate families, so the mother not coming was entirely out of her own will. 

Fast forward to about a month later and his mom began making rude remarks about me to him, calling me a wh*re and a sl*t and other obscene names, unprovoked. This behavior from her has carried on, and his mother has found every opportunity to make a rude remark about me. 

Fast forward again to a week ago and my boyfriend was once again grounded out of the blue when we had a trip planned. Since he was grounded he picked up extra shifts at work, doubles most days, until his father reached out to my mother and accused my boyfriend of “lying about being at work” in order to sneak around with me. Annoyed, I texted his father and said that I did not want my mom or myself being involved in tracking him and not trusting his whereabouts. (I had been working night shifts and neither of us would’ve had time to see each other, even in secret). After I texted the dad, my boyfriend told me that his mother had been talking about me in their family group and saying things like “she’s out of her mind” and “not good enough for him”, and today I was told that his father no longer wants me in their house. 

My boyfriend’s cousin has had similar experiences with the immediate family and told me to cut contact, saying that they all treat “outsiders” this way and that nothing will change the mom’s opinion.

122,1e3lsoe,AITA for telling my bf not to go on a military trip?,"My (22m) boyfriend and I (22f) have been dating for over a year. We are in a “medium distance” relationship since we live a decent distance away from each other to the point where we can only see each other on weekends. He is in the National Guard, and I always told myself I would never date anyone in the military because I wouldn’t be able to do long distance. Two months into us dating he went across the country for 2 months to do a training for getting certified in his military career. This was hard especially because we were still getting to know each other. Now, a year later, he tells me that he is taking a mandatory 1 month trip to Guam, but that they would ask (while in Guam) if anyone would willingly extend their trip to 4 months total. My boyfriend said he would be interested in this if presented to him. I’m upset because I wouldn’t choose to be away from him for 4 months. I understand and would deal with it if it was a deployment/mandatory extension of his stay, but it’s not. He has the option to say no, but he won’t. His reasoning for wanting to extend is that he loves his military job and doesn’t get to do it much since he’s in the guard which only requires a time commitment of one weekend a month, and his base does not always have work for him to do as his job isn’t needed frequently.

He hates his civilian job and does not want to do it for the rest of his life. It is just something he is doing because he doesn’t know what else to do. It barely pays his bills.

I just don’t know if I can mentally and emotionally handle my partner being gone for extended periods of time 2-3x a year. So, am I the asshole? ",TL;DR,2024-07-15,"AITA for telling my bf not to go on a military trip? My (22m) boyfriend and I (22f) have been dating for over a year. We are in a “medium distance” relationship since we live a decent distance away from each other to the point where we can only see each other on weekends. He is in the National Guard, and I always told myself I would never date anyone in the military because I wouldn’t be able to do long distance. Two months into us dating he went across the country for 2 months to do a training for getting certified in his military career. This was hard especially because we were still getting to know each other. Now, a year later, he tells me that he is taking a mandatory 1 month trip to Guam, but that they would ask (while in Guam) if anyone would willingly extend their trip to 4 months total. My boyfriend said he would be interested in this if presented to him. I’m upset because I wouldn’t choose to be away from him for 4 months. I understand and would deal with it if it was a deployment/mandatory extension of his stay, but it’s not. He has the option to say no, but he won’t. His reasoning for wanting to extend is that he loves his military job and doesn’t get to do it much since he’s in the guard which only requires a time commitment of one weekend a month, and his base does not always have work for him to do as his job isn’t needed frequently. He also claims that he would make more money in the 4 months that he is gone than he would at home doing his civilian job.

More recently she has been using this to her advantage, I am a very giving person and I always want to help people, which will usually make me vulnerable. Last week she had asked me to lend her $200 for a moving truck (since we are moving and her paycheque wasn’t able to cover), she gave me breakdown of how the 200 was going to be used as well.

This is important to her, so I decided I’d take action and I put a daily reminder in my phone to pay her a compliment.

126,1e3kj4d,AITA for always being rude to my mom,"
i know the title sounds messed up but let me explain. I’m 17F and I’ve never had a great relationship with my parents in general especially my mom. We disagree on everything and this mostly stems from my sexuality as my family has never accepted that I am bisexual. Especially my mom, she mentioned to me on numerous occasions that I better “drop the gay” act before she gets pissed even more off at me. She never respects my interests going as far to ban me from watching anime of all things because my older brother hates it. She likes my brother better and I’ve accepted that. But I think one of the worst things she’s said to me was how when I was struggling with depression /anxiety she didn’t want me to get help because it would go my “permanent record” and hurt my chances of getting into a Ivy league school. There’s something even worse she’s said to me but I can’t mention it here as it’s against the rules. Anyways recently I also found out she was cheating on my dad. I’m the only person who knows and though I haven’t told her that I know, she definitely knows that I know. She’s been treating me even worse than usual, telling me how ashamed she is of how I turned out and how I was a horrible person(this happened cause I didn’t give her a bite of my burger lol). She’s been mad because I haven’t been texting/talking to her “properly” while she is in Texas visiting family. (I’m at home in the different time zone btw.) She complains how I don’t text her first or call her first and brings up how my brother always asks how she’s doing in this heat but I’m dead silent. I don’t know how can she expect that from me? Me finding out that she was a cheater made me lose all respect for her. But idk I’ve talked to some friends and they were telling me I’ve been to harsh and she’s still my mom.

131,1e3jszq,AITAH for finally saying my piece?,"
My husband and I have been together for 10 years, married for 2. I never cared for his mother but I kept my mouth shut. She doesn’t live where we do and only saw her once a year. Text every few months or she texts with her woe is me shit, he ignores her.  They’re not close at all and she’s just drama. She’s been asked many times to not speak poorly of my FIL but, she doesn’t listen. She gaslights my husband non stop. 

For context, she up and left my FIL half of my husbands life ago. Moved across the country to “do what’s best for her”. She provided no child support or anything like that. She can’t admit she left her kids and presents herself as the best mother ever. Biggest hypocrite I’ve ever met. My husband became ill a few years ago, she walked into the hospital, took a selfie and reactivated her FB account after two years. 

My husband is very passive and can easily ignore things/people. She started one of her many childish fights before our wedding with my husband. She ended up texting me saying things like have a nice life with my son. Childish things. I can’t lie, I was glad she finally stepped on my toes. I definitely told her how it was and made her aware I know about all the shitty things she’s done. My husband reached his limit and decided he’s done with her.

We just ignore her and have her blocked on everything. But she is steady on the smear campaign. 

I had a narcissistic parent and I knew what she was was from day one. I tried to stay out of it but, she gave me no choice.

AITAH?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-15,"AITAH for finally saying my piece? 
My husband and I have been together for 10 years, married for 2. I never cared for his mother but I kept my mouth shut. She doesn’t live where we do and only saw her once a year. Text every few months or she texts with her woe is me shit, he ignores her.  They’re not close at all and she’s just drama. She’s been asked many times to not speak poorly of my FIL but, she doesn’t listen. She gaslights my husband non stop. 

For context, she up and left my FIL half of my husbands life ago. Moved across the country to “do what’s best for her”. She provided no child support or anything like that. She can’t admit she left her kids and presents herself as the best mother ever. Biggest hypocrite I’ve ever met. My husband became ill a few years ago, she walked into the hospital, took a selfie and reactivated her FB account after two years. 

My husband is very passive and can easily ignore things/people. She started one of her many childish fights before our wedding with my husband. She ended up texting me saying things like have a nice life with my son. Childish things. I can’t lie, I was glad she finally stepped on my toes. I definitely told her how it was and made her aware I know about all the shitty things she’s done. My husband reached his limit and decided he’s done with her. She ended up not coming to our wedding and after sulking to my eldest BIL, he didn’t attend our wedding either. But like always, a few months go by and she’s texting him like nothing happened. We just ignore her and have her blocked on everything. But she is steady on the smear campaign.

132,1e3jmhq,AITA for cussing out a lifeguard?,"I (17) babysat my little cousins (11F) and (1M) all day Friday and Saturday, parents at child-free wedding in Seattle.

Since it was hot ass hell we decided to go to the local community pool. We have been to this pool numerous times before, and i obvi checked in with the parents first. 

For context my little cousins are black, me and lifeguard are white, the 11yo is on her schools swim team and we are in the Deep South.

So we went to the pool and i was in the shallow end holding baby boy and just letting him splash his hands in the pool when the lifeguard comes up to me (I was standing near the edge of the pool) when a lifeguard who looked around my age but I hadn’t seen at the pool before came up to me and told me that “you have to hold all small children or have them in a swim carrier”. 

I was confused because I was already holding the baby, and then she pointed to 11yo who was using a kick board on the other side of the shallow end. I was even more confused because although 11yo is a little short, she still looks older than a baby.

I was like “uhhh she’s 11 and she’s a strong swimmer” then the lifeguard said “no she can’t, it’s the same rule for all small children”. I once agains repeated that she is 11, not a small child, and that there where other children around her age or younger that where swimming like normal, and the lifeguard said “this isn’t about them”.

So o just called 11yo to swim closer with us and for the next ten minutes she just played with lil bro in the far shallow end. And then 11yo asked me to time her while she held her breathe underwater, the moment her head went under the water the lifeguard blew her whistle and dragged her out of the water while i was yelling at her to stop. The life guard yelled at me that she can’t swim.

While she was yelling 11yo started crying and showed me that she had a few scratches on her leg from the edge of the pool where her leg rubbed against when the lifeguard was pulling her out, I lost it.

By now everyone was already looking at us because the lifeguard was yelling. I yelled at her back saying “She’s on the swim team you crazy racist cunt! You made her bleed you psycho!” I then gathered everything and we left.

I called my aunt and uncle on the way home and they came back Saturday afternoon.  

Aunt and uncle are on my side after the recounting from 11yo and me, but my mom is saying that I embarrassed myself by yelling and overreacted, my priest is also saying that I was in the wrong for swearing.

So AITA?

My mom and bio father divorced when I was around 1 or 2 years old, needless to say I don't remember anything. I have over the years talked to my mom about the divorce and I've gotten some very consistent answers, as for when I talk to my bio father I either don't get any answers or he tries to change the topic. I have gotten into one major fight with him because I simply asked if he would be willing to sign the adoption papers for my (step) dad to adopt me, I have known my dad since I was 3, and he raised me since my biological father would always be out on the road, doing different jobs every year or so. I asked my dad if he would adopt me when I was 16, I knew it would cause issues for my father since he thinks that he's always been the ""cool"" parent. I don't have any of the messages anymore since I got a new phone and new number, the fight went on for about a week & a half, I simply asked him if he'd be willing to sign the papers. Obviously as you would probably imagine he didn't like that I asked that, and he even said that he wouldn't let another man give me his last name till I got married (side note I'm a lesbian). I asked him why since he's never been there for me, then he went on to blame my mom for everything, not going to counseling (even though my mom is the one who wanted to go), saying my was the reason we moved from Georgia (our home state) to Michigan (my dads home state). I tried to keep the situation at a 3 but it eventually escalated to a 20, I was in my junior year of highschool (the first time I went to HS in person), and we fought in and out of school, I was sending screenshots to my mom asking for clarification for 90% of the things he'd say because he has lied before. I tried to not let this bother me when I was in class, but one day we were watching a video in class and I just happen to look at my phone to see the time, and he messaged me, it was all lies about my mom which I lived with all my life. I don't wish any harm to come to my father, but after trying to manipulate me into seeing my mom a different way like he did with my oldest brother, which he brought into the mess between us. He has ruined his chances for me to see him how my child eyes saw him. 
 I don't know if I can ever forgive him for what he said or did emotionally to hurt me whether it was intentional or not; I personally do not think he was intentionally trying to hurt me, because I am still his daughter. I do wish I could go back in time and say something different to my father other than what I said, that potentially hurt him. We have only had 2 ""daddy-daughter days"" in the 17 years my parents have been divorced, if I wanted to go out with just my father he'd always bring my youngest step sister (the one that got into the car accident).

But now we’ve exchanged some nasty words I don’t think the friendship can come back from, and another girl (B) fully blocked me on everything.

136,1e3io6d,WIBTA if I confronted my friend for not allowing me to talk to his ex?,"Seven months ago, my friend's girlfriend of 10 months broke up with him. There was no drama, she just realised she didn't feel that way anymore. My friend Max had a hard time going through the break up, and our big friend group supported him through it. Max was very clear about not wanting to talk to the ex ever again. 

Now, about the ex, May. May is lovely. We would never hang out one on one, but she was always nice to talk to during group hangouts. She was always friendly, and we were happy to include her in our hangouts. But we never really became close friends. Regardless, when they broke up, me and some other friends were a bit sad that she's not around anymore. But, obviously, Max was our priority.

Our city is small, and everyone runs into each other. So I was not at all surprised to meet May one day on the street. Me and May had a small talk, and I said that it's kinda sad that we don't see her around anymore. She said that she feels the same way as she got used to our friend group. I then said that I'd be chill to hangout with her one on one if she ever wants to, but we never did.

I am an artist, and sometimes I sell my art at markets. And, obviously, I promote upcoming markets online, and May would sometimes see it.

Few days ago, I and some friends were selling at one of the markets. Many of our other friends knew about it and came to say hi or to buy something from us, including Max. After Max left, May also came by and bought something from me.

Then Max came again. He approached my table and mentioned that he saw May leaving. He said that he asked her what she was doing here, and she said that she came to see me. Max asked if we hangout.

I was very open with my response. Max got very serious and told me to not hangout with her, that he wants her out of his life, and he really wants to set this boundary. There were some customers around, so this entire conversation just felt very inappropriate. This was a public space. I was clearly busy. I just kept saying that, of course, his feelings matter, I will respect them, and so on. Then Max proceeded to talk to my other friends about the same thing, coming to everyone individually.

After the market, I finally had some time to process everything that happened, and I now I'm really angry. I respect people's boundaries, and I would never invite May to any of our group hangouts, but genuinely it's none of Max's business who I hangout with. I told my partner that Max made me really uncomfortable by saying all that, and he agreed with me, but Max is also our good friend, and I wouldn't want to make things weird between us. However, I really feel like I need to talk about this to Max. I could brush it off, but I'm just so angry.

Lately she has started to post the exact same photos, wearing the exact same clothes which I wear (mind you it is not a common clothing and picture style) while photoshopping certain body parts, making her body look more like mine even though she doesn't look like that in real life.

My main concern was not the style but rather her photoshopping her body to look a lot like mine when she has the opposite body type.

She has often bought the same stuff that I have (same bag, same phone case, same clothes etc.) 
and has changed her mind about getting tattoos after I told her I want them even though she never wanted any and she wants the same motive I talked about getting soon.

Someone has even texted me saying she thought it was me in the picture and after showing that picture to my mom she has also mistaken that person for me.

I have texted her and mentioned that I feel uncomfortable and weird that she seems to imitate  my style and body type and she has been super defensive saying she only took inspiration from her pinterest and that there are other girls that dress like this too.

Our style has always been the opposite of each other, she liked to wear bright girly clothing while I have a rather dark goth fashion style.

Lately she has started to post the exact same photos, wearing the exact same clothes which I wear (mind you it is not a common clothing and picture style) while photoshopping certain body parts, making her body look more like mine even though she doesn't look like that in real life.

My main concern was not the style but rather her photoshopping her body to look a lot like mine when she has the opposite body type.

She has often bought the same stuff that I have (same bag, same phone case, same clothes etc.) 
and has changed her mind about getting tattoos after I told her I want them even though she never wanted any and she wants the same motive I talked about getting soon.

Someone has even texted me saying she thought it was me in the picture and after showing that picture to my mom she has also mistaken that person for me.

I have texted her and mentioned that I feel uncomfortable and weird that she seems to imitate  my style and body type and she has been super defensive saying she only took inspiration from her pinterest and that there are other girls that dress like this too. She has told me she photoshopped herself but not because of my body (she always looked at that exact part of my body and said she wished she had it)
