1,1e4icse,WIBTA if I moved out from my dads house because of my stepmom?,"AITA for not wanting to live with my stepmom?

I (18m) live with my dad (50m), my stepmom (47f) and my two younger siblings (6m and 3f). We are all from a South American country but firstly when I moved with them I had to move to the USA and one year after I had to move to an European country with them and I got some language classes that my dads job paid for (twice per week) but I was thrown at school on my own and expected to do great there with basically no knowledge on the language. This created many conflicts between us because I couldn‚Äôt understand the classes and ended up having to repeat an school year. Besides that our family life is really turbulent because of me and my stepmom. She‚Äôs very controlling. She sometimes hit my siblings and scream at them and always find something to be mad about. She‚Äôs what I‚Äôd call a clean freak and in my first years living with her she would randomly get in my room, ‚Äúinspect‚Äù the cleanliness and then not let me go out or do certain things based on her opinion on it. I help around the house with chores, btw. Before I also didn‚Äôt have a curfew and my dad didn‚Äôt have any problems with me seeing friends but because of school stuff (keep in mind I‚Äôm not fluent in the language of the country) she started controlling my free time. Now, she suddenly has a problem with my friends using our couch. They‚Äôre gone for a weekend and I watched a movie with some friends at home, nothing crazy, but now that she‚Äôs back she says the pillows smell terrible and that all my friends stink (she blames it on them being European and us Latinos) and says they‚Äôre not allowed to use our couch and need to sit on the floor if they come here.

Other things that she‚Äôs done include:

Taking away the key of my door bc she didn‚Äôt like the smell on the shirt I was wearing (it was my boyfriends shirt and she says he doesn‚Äôt know how to wash clothes).

I‚Äôm trans and when I got a boyfriend she asked me in a fight if we had anal sex or vaginal sex bc she said it was ‚Äúhypocritical‚Äù of me to have vaginal sex while identifying as a boy.

She brings up the fact that she has opinions on my gender very often and always says ‚Äúbut inside you‚Äôre a girl so‚Ä¶‚Äù

Say that I‚Äôm the reason for her having problems with my dad.

Wanting to forbid me of eating in my room because I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt deserve the privilege‚Äù.

Saying that my boyfriend will leave me bc I repeated a school year.

Also I had to hide the fact that I was having language classes for a while bc she was jealous that she had to work and couldn‚Äôt study the language (my dad and the kids are the only ones fluent at it). My dad says she is just a bit of a clean freak and has a strong personality, plus wanting to learn the language (nowadays she is in a language school and working part time) due to all this I‚Äôve been trying to find a way out of the house but idk if her behavior is actually ok or not.

2,1e4gvut,AITA for dropping two of my friends without speaking to them first?,"Sorry if this is a little messy and the spellings wrong, its 1am for me and im on phone.

So currently between a group of friends we've had a major falling out. It wasnt actually too surpising honestly. Two of the people in the group were usually major assholes.

They always talked over other people, included random people into the group drama, so on and so fourth.

One of the friends who had already left had pointed out how bad everyone generally was. And yes, that includes myself. I respect her descion on leaving the group and honestly im glad i followed her lead. 

One of the people in the group who i'll just call Lucy, would often make backhanded remarks and play it off as a joke. But as soon as someone would do the same to them, theyd throw a hissy fit. They were one of the people who tried to play victim in everything.

I personally have my own reasons for not liking them:

Tried to guess my deadname (i am ftm)- idc if it was a joke. They're under the trans umbrella as well. They know how harmful that can be.

Told me to end it when I was/am already at a low point mentally

Made fun of the fact I was crying one time and said it was 'annoying'.

Compared my friend to an abuser. Keep in mind my friend was trying to change for THEM.

Would always complain about the fact people would talk over them when theyd do the same.
That is just a short part of why i did not like Lucy, there is just so much more i could go into.

The other person who i'll call Elsa, also did things that that, i personally did not agree with.

We had a server in the group for everyone to talk and hangout with, we also had an NSFW section. And ovbiously my friends and I used to for sending NSFW artwork and stuff.

Lucy and Elsa, who said they dont feel comfortable with seeing anything NSFW related, and i 100% respected that!

But knowing that it was the NSFW chat, knowing what kind of things would be going on in there. They still went into the NSFW chat, cliked on the very much censored and labled as porn and then got mad for us for using the NSFW for NSFW.

Elsa would always seek out the smallest thing of drama

No matter what actually happened, Elsa would take Lucys side

Recently everything had gotten too much for me and my friends, so we finally dropped them. Now, i'll admit, im the greatest with talking about my feelings and confrontation, it was how i was raised. 

So i kinda just. Kicked them from the server, left any server and group chat that we had in common and unfriened them. I know it was a coward move, but it was the quickest way to get it done.

When i look at the days ive had to deal with Elsa and Lucy, all i truly see is a lot of the things that shouldve been red flags in the first place. As i stayed friends with them, my eating and sleeping habits slowly became worse and worse.

I just wanted to know if i did the right or wrong thing?

I didn't tell my family about it. I shared it on my personal profile to boost followers, didn't state that I was the author. If you know me, you could figure it out but I liked the idea of anonymity.

After a story on my blog my sister called asking probing questions to see if I would tell her about it,I said ""you found my blog"" she admitted she was reading and upset that I hadn't shared things with her.

We discussed she could see how my blog was beneficial to me and might help others in similar situations. She asked if she should stop reading it I said that probably better for our relationship. She said she would respect my privacy.

Despite our conversation she kept reading. We live in different cities and don't see each other except for holidays. At some stage she got offended by something and didn't tell me. She told Mum and everyone else that I was writing bull$h#t rubbish stories about her.... which I wasn't... she decided I was having a go at her parenting style? I don't know. Eventually after months of not talking to me, she sent me a text ""should we just have it out?""

An abusive phone call later and I was deemed ""such an awful person, completely lacking in common sense"" that she ""didn't want \[me\] in her life"" it was pretty hurtful and sent me in a downwards cycle. I'm still pretty torn up and emotional about it. And I felt like my outlet and processing means was taken away from me.

My mom:46f mom's friend: early 20s and I: 17 were at my house a few days ago. I had just gotten out of the bathtub and wanted to go into the living room because I don't like going into my room when in not fully dried off due to the air flow, when I got out of the Bathroom and went to the living room/kitchen to see my mom's friend. My mom's friend is really touchy and bothers both me and my little sis, she like to grab onto us and touch us and constantly wants us to hug her and when we tell her no she proceeds to do it anyways. Both me and my sister do not like to be physically touched randomly and I don't like the feeling of hugging people I don't know because it makes me uncomfortable. I told my mom's friend to stop touching me over and over and she was disregarding my boundaries and would not listen to the word no she was even trying to take and play on my handheld gaming system which i don't feel comfortable giving to other people. Eventually after she kept following me around the kitchen I couldnt do it anymore I lost it and said some pretty harsh words to her which I shouldn't have said and my mom yelled at me cussing me out and saying that she's the parent and she gets to decide what I do and since i would give her friend a hug she wont let me go out or do anything since i wont be nice to her but i just didnt want to be hugged and everyone is calling me an ahole for yelling at her about how i have boundaries and she needs to respect them. This happens to me and my little sis Everytime she comes over if we are out of our rooms she will hunt us down for hugs and me and my sis don't even feel comfortable coming out of our rooms when she's around.

7,1e4blvb,WIBTA for locking my husband out of our house?,"Ok, I‚Äôm feeling super petty so buckle up. 

My husband travels a shit ton, a lot of which is for work. He‚Äôs usually gone 2-3 days a week. 

When he took this job, he told me he‚Äôd cut down on his hobbies (mainly golf) because he‚Äôd be traveling so much. Two purposes - one to make sure we could still spend time together with him gone so much, and also so he‚Äôd have more time to pick up the slack because I‚Äôm pretty much doing all household management - not even just when he‚Äôs gone at this point. I cook, grocery shop, take care of the dog, do laundry, organize appointments, take care of household maintenance, car maintenance, manage our budget, etc. Hopefully you get the point, I do a lot. I don‚Äôt usually mind as long as he appreciates that I‚Äôm taking on the majority of the load there, and doesn‚Äôt do the BS of ‚ÄúWell I do a lot too!‚Äù And, the big thing, that when I ask him to do something he does it. No questions asked, no pushing it off. It. Just. Gets. Done. 

Now onto his hobbies. He spends between 20-40 hours a week playing golf. He‚Äôs good - top 5% of all golfers good. And he loves it, plus it‚Äôs something he does with friends so is a social outlet as well. Usually I‚Äôm all for it but lately it just feels wayyyy over the top. He‚Äôs been traveling a ton, letting things slide at home, and not doing anything to change it. 

Most recently, he played 2 rounds of golf between Monday and Wednesday of last week, left our house on Thursday night for a golf boys trip, and was gone until last night at which point he came home and told me he was too tired to do anything. Ok. Fair enough. I asked him to set aside time tonight because there‚Äôs like three things we need to do together. He agreed. 

Well, guess who‚Äôs currently out golfing with his buddies and texted me that he couldn‚Äôt make tonight work for getting stuff done with me? And, adding insult to injury, he‚Äôs currently at a fucking casino and all of the pots I cooked us dinner in last night that he said he‚Äôs clean this morning are still sitting on the stove, dirty. 

We have smart locks and because I am the manager of the house he doesn‚Äôt have the app to control them on his phone. I am sitting here, and all I want to do is remove all of his access codes and lock him out of the house.

8,1e4bjb3,AITA for hanging up on my mom over social media ,"As the title says, I (32f) have a mom (60f) who many would classify as ""narcissistic"" but she has never been officially diagnosed.


My dad (63m) passed from pancreatic cancer 10 months ago and he and my mom were married for 42 years, since she was 18! She has had a lot of trouble with the idea of not having him around and being by herself. Yesterday my husband and I went over to help her with a new tv and hanging a new mirror, while my husband ran to a hardware store for a few things I talked to my mom about social media. She has always been extremely against any form of social media but when I mentioned Facebook Marketplace, she immediately started signing up. She added a few family members and posted a few pictures.


Today she called me saying one of her friends posted something that basically said, ""profiles are getting hacked and they don't add me if you get a friend request..."". She said frantically that she wants to delete the friend because she's scared of getting hacked. I went and looked and it was one of those photos people post like ""Facebook is doing this, repost this in your story to stop it from happening to you.."" 
I said, ""ok this is just a thing people post. It's not a fake account, the person just posted this to ""warn"" others."" 


She suddenly started screaming at me saying I was laughing at her and I need to stop. She went from fear to complete anger. I immediately said, ""nobody is laughing."" She responded, ""yes you are, I hear you!"" Again, nobody was laughing, giggling, breathing hard, etc. so I said, ""mom if you're going to yell at me I'm going to hang up."" She firmly said, ""K."" There was silence so I took a deep breath and asked if she wants me to help. She again firmly said, ""I want you to tell me how to unfriend her."" I explained it step by step, asked her to confirm it worked and she then responded, ""okay. Unfriended."" I said ok, and hung up the phone.

9,1e4bdh0,AITA for telling my girlfriend‚Äôs roommate to mind her own business?,"My (31m) girlfriend (28F) and I have been dating for almost 3 years. During that time she has been living with her roommate Kelly (30f) in a house that Kelly‚Äôs dad owns, though my girlfriend still pays rent. They don‚Äôt have a formal lease agreement so my girlfriend can move out whenever. My own lease is coming up in about three months so I thought it would be a great time for me and my girlfriend to start looking for a new place together.

I was over at their place last week and brought up the question of us moving in together.

I told Kelly that she should mind her own business and she is obviously just using my girlfriend for rent money that she doesn‚Äôt even need, since her dad owns the house.

Kelly said that she pays rent just like my girlfriend. And my girlfriend then said that she does pay less to Kelly than she would pay to split a place with me. And that‚Äôs true BUT if she lived with me she would have a much shorter commute (5 minutes vs 20 minutes) plus actual air conditioning (their house just has window units). I tried to explain this but my girlfriend shut it down and told me to leave and we would talk later.

My girlfriend texted me later to say that I should have been nicer to Kelly since Kelly is just looking out for her, and that she feels like she should stick it out at least another year with Kelly since she ‚Äúowes her‚Äù.

10,1e4b8ix,AITA for staying neutral in in-laws divorce?,"My BIL and SIL got divorced last winter after 40 yrs.Their daughter & her husband have a huge house and asked them to move in to help raise their granddaughter.

SIL is 1 of 8 (the 8).My wife is her step sister with a different Mom.My wife never knew their father who died shortly after she was born, & grew up an only child.Her Mom sheltered her from this until she was 17, when 1 of the 8 contacted her.Some of the 8 did not want to meet her.Not all,but many still hold a grudge & refuse to have a relationship.Because of this, when she would get together with SIL and BIL,it was always separate.We were never invited to holidays  like everyone else and going to large family gatherings was awkward.SIL never confronted the 8 over their behavior,staying neutral. So even though they are step sisters, my wife has sometimes felt like an outsider. Until now, we had a good relationship with both. A few years ago the 8 divided over caring  for their ailing mother & SIL & that side cut off contact with the other side.

During the divorce, we stayed neutral. We acted as a support to both, letting SIL store her stuff at our place.We let them vent.Whatever they told us was in confidence.At one point early in the separation,SIL said ""you know, BIL will always be your BIL, even though we're not together anymore"".At some point BIL rebounds with a new gf,but doesn't tell anyone.In Jan,BIL told us about his gf.SIL calls us to fish for info, my wife reluctantly confirms,but SIL is upset we didn't tell her first.Our Son‚Äôs communion was in the Spring.My BIL asked to bring his new gf, & we said no, tried to protect SIL.SIL acted aloof, also wasn‚Äôt overly friendly at her granddaughters bday party in May.Late May SIL texts my wife:""We have to talk"".So they text back and forth in vain trying to agree on a date. Both had vacations we were working around.SIL was cold, giving terse answers.So a few days ago, my wife texts again.SIL replies back livid, furious that my wife didn't pick up the phone,didn't take her side,didn't tell her about the new gf and that we didnt ask her permission to invite her ex husband to my son's Communion,calling my wife names and saying""you can have BIL and his (derogatory) gf,someday he will dump you and when he does,I told you so"".I replied that we stayed neutral.She said only kids can stay neutral, everyone else has to take a side.I explained we see them both as our kids' Aunt and Uncle, but she feels betrayed as my wife is her ""flesh and blood"",and owed her allegiance.

11,1e4awyb,AITA Graduation Party ,"Hi everyone here's the whole long story...my daughter graduated from highschool this past month and we talked her into having a small family party. My mom passed away a few months ago and I really don't talk to a lot of my family anymore because we all got busy with our lives, we all used to be extremely close. We only see each other at funerals now and we all said we need to see each other during something happy instead of sad. I haven't invited my family to anything in a lot of years mainly because I haven't had a big enough party worth inviting anyone to. So at the funeral I asked everyone if I had a graduation party for my daughter would they like to come. Everyone said yes in some way or the other and most said we definitely need this as a family. I told them the reason I'm asking before sending out invites is so I know where to have the party at. I sincerely tried to ask who would think they would come so I could try and plan to accommodate everyone. A few weeks later I posted on FB for everyone to let me know again who would be willing to come just cause I know how emotional funerals get and people agree to things they don't mean..again I got multiple yes replies, I'm down, wouldn't miss it. Okay so now I plan the party, rent a room at a center, ground level, AC. I have accommodated everyone I can think of. I then send out the invitation almost 3 weeks before the party with an RSVP date 1 week before the party. Only 2 people respond with a I'll be there ,I wouldn't miss it. Everyone else in my family either didn't respond or just liked the picture. I even sent out mailed invites to some older family members just in case. I know some people just don't RSVP so I kinda left it to that, 1 day before the RSVP deadline I sent another post asking everyone that was coming to confirm that they are and how many people they were bringing so I know how much food I need. Now no one replied to that. Not one single one of my family members showed up, even the 2 who said they would be there when I sent the invites. I understand completely if something comes up you cant come but the complete rudeness and lack of any type of etiquette has royally pissed me off. I went off on a few of them and told them that's exactly why I stopped talking to all of you..among other things. I made the decision to not attend any family anything in the future ever. I will only attend my aunts or uncles funerals when they pass out of respect for my mom. But that's it no one else. My LO says I'm overreacting and my my cousin says I'm being a B**** and being childish. Fact is..I wouldn't have needed to rent a room to accommodate the people who came to her party, I could have had it at a park and saved money. I needed the room ONLY if my family members were going to be in attendance. Then because I had no idea if anyone was actually coming or not I had to still make sure there was enough food to feed people if they did come. So I'm just wondering AITA and overreacting?

12,1e4avap,AITA For threatening to kick out my friend for disrespecting my apartment,"I (27M) was holding a get-together with some of my old college friends to celebrate the 4th of July. It was me and my three other friends: Tom (24M), Rick (23M), and Jason (24M). I just recently bought an apartment and I'm currently working on fixing it up. It needs some touch-up here and there like painting the walls, filling up old nail holes left behind from shelves/paintings, and other small stuff like that was left behind from the previous owner. I got a couple small projects done, but I want to take my time and make everything look perfect.¬†

¬†This all started when I left with Tom and Jason to go to the store to pick up some food for later. I have known Rick for a couple of years now and thought nothing of leaving him behind. When I got back to the apartment, Rick was very apologetic and led me over to a toilet paper holder that was now on the ground. To say I was disappointed was an understatement. I had some choice words for Rick that I'm not too proud of myself for saying. Rick apologized a bunch and I eventually cooled off, but when I did finally cool off Tom decided to bring up that he had seen the holder dangling in the wall on an earlier visit. I told Tom I didn't want to hear any of it and that he was making excuses for Rick and that Rick should be held accountable for something he broke. Even if the holder was slightly broken before, Rick was the one that fully broke it. Tom told me that that didn‚Äôt matter since I was fixing everything up anyways. I told him again that I didn't want to hear it right now and that he was being very disrespectful to my apartment that I was letting the three of them sleep in.¬†

Later in the day when I finally had a chance to think about everything, I decided to apologize to Rick since he seemed generally sorry for breaking the holder. Rick accepted my apology, but then Tom doubled down and said that Rick didn‚Äôt break it. I told Tom that he was on thin ice and that was that. The rest of the night went fine.¬†

¬†The next morning, I felt bad for originally getting mad at Rick, so I decided to apologize to him again. I thought I was giving Tom an opportunity to apologize for disrespecting both me and my apartment, but no. He couldn‚Äôt get over himself and said he did nothing wrong and that he wouldn‚Äôt apologize. I told him to get out of my apartment. After some back and forward, He eventually apologized and that was the end of it.¬†

¬†I let the three of them stay at my place and they not only broke something but were disrespectful about it. I thought I warned Tom plenty to back off, but he just wouldn‚Äôt let it go. Jason even told Tom that he was making excuses for Rick. I don‚Äôt know why Tom had to make this a bigger deal than it was and why he had to join the ordeal.

When I got back to the apartment, Rick was very apologetic and led me over to a toilet paper holder that was now on the ground. To say I was disappointed was an understatement. I had some choice words for Rick that I'm not too proud of myself for saying. Rick apologized a bunch and I eventually cooled off, but when I did finally cool off Tom decided to bring up that he had seen the holder dangling in the wall on an earlier visit. I told Tom I didn't want to hear any of it and that he was making excuses for Rick and that Rick should be held accountable for something he broke. Even if the holder was slightly broken before, Rick was the one that fully broke it. Tom told me that that didn‚Äôt matter since I was fixing everything up anyways. I told him again that I didn't want to hear it right now and that he was being very disrespectful to my apartment that I was letting the three of them sleep in.¬†

Later in the day when I finally had a chance to think about everything, I decided to apologize to Rick since he seemed generally sorry for breaking the holder. Rick accepted my apology, but then Tom doubled down and said that Rick didn‚Äôt break it. I told Tom that he was on thin ice and that was that. The rest of the night went fine.¬†

¬†The next morning, I felt bad for originally getting mad at Rick, so I decided to apologize to him again. I thought I was giving Tom an opportunity to apologize for disrespecting both me and my apartment, but no. He couldn‚Äôt get over himself and said he did nothing wrong and that he wouldn‚Äôt apologize. I told him to get out of my apartment. After some back and forward, He eventually apologized and that was the end of it.¬†

¬†I let the three of them stay at my place and they not only broke something but were disrespectful about it. I thought I warned Tom plenty to back off, but he just wouldn‚Äôt let it go. Jason even told Tom that he was making excuses for Rick. I don‚Äôt know why Tom had to make this a bigger deal than it was and why he had to join the ordeal. I thought my actions were justified at the time, but after talking it out with a couple other friends, I'm not too sure.",1.0,0.99108094,1,1
13,1e4as2b,WIBTA if I contacted former roommate for some of the money she left owing?,"I never once thought I would be posting here for advice. I 40'sF and my husband 40's M have recently found ourselves in the worst financial hardship we have ever faced in nearly 11 years together and I am at a total loss as to what to do just to keep our heads above water at this point.

As I have seen on many of these, this is where I would add in the backstory so I will make this as brief as possible. Husband and I agreed to help a longtime friend out of a very bad marriage. The three of us talked, agreed upon terms such as rent and groceries and then moved her into our spare bedroom. 

In the beginning, my husband was on a break from working trying to decide what he wanted to do for work as his last job had abruptly ended due to the sale of the business. She and I were both working full time, so it wasn't a big issue. Things took a turn when my husband started working again and then shortly after her divorce finally went to court to be finalized. We supported her and even took her out to dinner to celebrate her freedom and all seemed to be happy.

Suddenly when her divorce finalized, she stopped helping with anything in the house, groceries housework cooking. She even seemed to suddenly ""forget"" to pay her agreed rent. To the point of, she would deduct from her rent if she bought anything for the house like toilet paper or dog food. 

I recently had to quit my job due to the toll it had been taking on my health. The three of us had long talks about the financial impact it would be losing my income for a few months. Both my husband and roommate assured me that we would be ok with the two of them working. Once it was official I was taking some time off from work, and another round of 'where's the rent' she gave a few excuses and the next weekend with no forewarning, her daughter just shows up to help her move out. She left telling husband ""Thank you for giving me time and space to heal"" and without a word to me just left and she has been avoiding me since. 

Last week, husband's job has run out as there just wasn't enough work doing maintenance at this time. He has been putting in applications and today he had a promising interview, but it is still a wait and see.

This brief summary now brings us to today, where I sit here near tears with stress about having a negative balance in my account and nowhere to turn. Where I live, we don't have city emergency type resources. Churches don't offer assistance for bills or anything like that. Our circle of friends is so small that I truly have nobody nearby to turn to for any type of help.

14,1e4arqc,AITA for getting a wedding canceled by sending a video to the bride,"TLDR: I supplied my future aunt-in-law with proof that a cousin is talking shit about her which caused one of the wedding celebrations to be canceled.

My uncle Jay(28M) is marrying Mel(26F). She's shy so she never wanted a big wedding where she has to walk down the aisle etc. She wants to elope with just him and her and also have a traditional wedding from her country. He's completely cool with doing things how she wants it.

But Jay's mom, Amanda, wants the typical wedding. Mel conceded that she was okay with having an additional third wedding where Amanda could do all the planning and Mel would veto anything she didn't like. Cost-wise, it's no issue because the other two weddings are essentially free.

The problem started when Amanda was showing Mel the bridesmaid list. There were going to be 7 bridesmaids, and one of them was Jay's cousin Leti (27F). Leti has been nothing but rude to Mel since the day they met. She constantly makes little digs at her, talks shit about her, and overall makes it clear that she does not like her.

So Mel immediately vetoed it. Leti was in the room sitting with them during the veto and threw a fit, talking about how Mel is always rude to her. I can vouch for Mel and say that she never chooses to interact with Leti in any way shape/form. What she does do is whenever Leti makes a snide comment, she makes a direct comment back in response. So to an outsider, it might seem like Mel is being hostile but to everyone in the family, it's a roll-your-eyes moment where we know Leti is the asshole, and Mel just isn't taking it.

Leti tried to claim that Mel has been holding a grudge based on the first week of them meeting, but then Mel pulled out a video (that I sent her:/) of Leti talking shit about her just a couple of days ago. In it, Leti's calling her a bitch and saying stuff like she's not even that pretty, etc). Amanda sees this and immediately starts minimizing it saying oh she didn't mean that and so on.

At this point, I think Mel has had enough because everyone in the family knows how Leti acts towards her, but they never take it seriously. They only slightly tell Leti off and are always trying to convince Mel to not take it to heart. So Mel says that she's sorry but the wedding is off. She's still going to marry Jay in the other two originally planned ways, but she's not going to do Amanda's version anymore. She says this all nicely (as always) but Amanda is now crying, Leti's screaming at everyone, and other family members are saying that Mel should learn how to take a joke.

Days later, I said I was the one who sent Mel the video and now a couple of family members are mad at me for getting involved. Was I the asshole here?

15,1e4ar3l,AITA for insisting my friends pay for their two sons as adults on group trips?,"I (38F) often travel with friends who share my interests, including a couple (50M and 50F) with two children (now 15M and 11M). Initially, we counted the boys as one person when dividing expenses because they were younger (around 9 and 6).

However, this has raised questions on subsequent trips, although no one has directly addressed the parents. The boys usually get their own room, order what they want, and participate in shared meals. Some friends have privately asked why they only pay for one child.

On our last trip, they initially planned to bring one son but ended up bringing both. They only paid for three places in our rental home instead of four, which not everyone agreed with. This also meant we needed to bring an extra car.

During the trip, the parents privately asked if we thought it was fair for their youngest son, Jaime, to pay the same as an adult, given he eats less. While Jaime is picky, their older son, Oliver, eats more than most adults. The mother even joked, ‚ÄúWhatever Jaime doesn‚Äôt eat, Oliver will finish!‚Äù

We mostly ate in the house but had one special night out where Jaime didn't like the food and didn‚Äôt eat much. It didn‚Äôt occur to me at the time to exclude him from the bill (I‚Äôm a vegetarian and didn‚Äôt eat the steak but still paid my share). At other meals, Jaime ordered individual plates similar to the rest of us. I also believe it was the parents‚Äô responsibility to bring up the subject with the whole group.

Regarding other meals, Jaime and Oliver usually had cereal and milk while the adults ate more substantial breakfasts. Their parents often commented on our breakfast portions compared to the boys. Lunches and dinners were similar in portion size, though the boys didn‚Äôt drink alcohol. For context, I brought four bottles of wine and didn‚Äôt include them in expenses, and we bought beer, averaging 4-5 beers per adult over the week.

After returning home, the parents expressed their hurt that we didn‚Äôt offer to reduce some expenses since the boys didn‚Äôt eat as much as the adults. I pointed out that they hadn‚Äôt paid an equal share for the house and that Jaime and Oliver are at an age where they should be included as adults. Other friends have commented on this too. While I understand it‚Äôs expensive to travel as a family of four, both parents have well-paying jobs.

In the evening of day 1, he asked me if I‚Äôd feel okay with him going clubbing with the rest of the group and leaving me at home. I can usually get into bars with an edited photo for a fake. He didn‚Äôt think I could get in the NYC clubs.  A friend of mine at NYU confirmed, saying I‚Äôd have better luck in lower Manhattan. My boyfriend had already pre ordered tickets someplace else (without consulting me or the other girl in our group). I felt no point in suggesting we try to get me in or anything.

I believe everyone should get to do what they want to, and that we should have full autonomy over ourselves. I also enjoy my time alone tbh.

19,1e4am6v,AITAH for complaining about my other friends to one of my close friends?,"(I'll use fake names for the people's privacy.)

When me and my friend (who I will call Joshua) hung out, at some point it would always come to the topic of our other friends. My mother taught me to never talk bad about my friends, so at first when Joshua started to complain about things our other friends did, I was a bit uncomfortable to say the least. After a bit of us being friends and hanging out, I was used to the complaining about our other friends and had forgotten that it had been a bit bad to do. It got to that topic once again and we complained about how our other friend (I will call him Ryan) hadn't cleaned himself properly and how he had an unhealthy living condition in his room. I was concerned for him and I was trying to stear away from the topic a bit,  but it would always come back to complaining about Ryan in particular. Eventually I vented to Joshua that sometimes Ryan was a bit annoying and he had agreed. I really liked Ryan as a friend but I didn't know how to feel about him as a whole because of how he was living and how he acted sometimes. I thought of this as normal venting at this point because Joshua had made it so normal for me. I vented to him about my depression and how our friends were doing things I didn't quite like. He made it to be a safe space for the both of us to vent to each other. (Side note, Joshua told me all of our friends secrets which I probably shouldn't know.) I did try to help Ryan with his living condition, but it got so bad I would almost gag anytime I entered his house. Now recently, Joshua texted me how he didn't want to be friends anymore because all I did was complain about our friends. All of our friends in that group now currently don't like me and are sticking on Joshua's side because he won't admit that he had complained about our friends as well. I am too afraid to confront him about it because currently I have deleted his contact off my phone and if I did confront him he would say I was the only one complaining. I did apologize to Ryan, (I feel horrible about complaining about him) but I have cut contacts with all my friends because of this whole situation.

Please tell me because I don't know how to feel.",Everyone Sucks,2024-07-16,"AITAH for complaining about my other friends to one of my close friends? (I'll use fake names for the people's privacy.)

When me and my friend (who I will call Joshua) hung out, at some point it would always come to the topic of our other friends. My mother taught me to never talk bad about my friends, so at first when Joshua started to complain about things our other friends did, I was a bit uncomfortable to say the least. After a bit of us being friends and hanging out, I was used to the complaining about our other friends and had forgotten that it had been a bit bad to do. It got to that topic once again and we complained about how our other friend (I will call him Ryan) hadn't cleaned himself properly and how he had an unhealthy living condition in his room. I was concerned for him and I was trying to stear away from the topic a bit,  but it would always come back to complaining about Ryan in particular. Eventually I vented to Joshua that sometimes Ryan was a bit annoying and he had agreed. I really liked Ryan as a friend but I didn't know how to feel about him as a whole because of how he was living and how he acted sometimes. I thought of this as normal venting at this point because Joshua had made it so normal for me. I vented to him about my depression and how our friends were doing things I didn't quite like. He made it to be a safe space for the both of us to vent to each other. (Side note, Joshua told me all of our friends secrets which I probably shouldn't know.) I did try to help Ryan with his living condition, but it got so bad I would almost gag anytime I entered his house. Now recently, Joshua texted me how he didn't want to be friends anymore because all I did was complain about our friends. All of our friends in that group now currently don't like me and are sticking on Joshua's side because he won't admit that he had complained about our friends as well.

20,1e4ahj5,AITA for still using the baby name I‚Äôve had picked out for 10+ years even though my new SIL is using the same name?,"AITA for still wanting to use the baby name I‚Äôve had picked out for 10* years? 

I don‚Äôt know what the protocol is on this and I need opinions. I‚Äôm the last person to ever want to offend someone, and I don‚Äôt know what I should do in this situation. I love ONE name for a girl. My husband and I are going to be trying for a baby in the next three-ish months. We started discussing a baby about 6 months ago. We both loved the girl name I suggested, which was to honor both my late grandfather AND grandmother. They were very special to me. So I wanted to use the female version of my grandfather‚Äôs name as our baby‚Äôs first name (assuming we have a girl one day) and my grandmother‚Äôs first name as the baby‚Äôs middle name. The two names just go so perfectly together, and it‚Äôs what I‚Äôd wanted to name my future baby girl for at least 10 years. 

My SIL found out she‚Äôs pregnant about 5 months ago and about 2 months ago, my BIL told my husband that they want to use the name we‚Äôd talked about (no, my BIL didn‚Äôt know that we loved that name I don‚Äôt think, it was pure coincidence) and I feel heartbroken. They had two names for girls that they were considering but ended choosing the name I love. The name we love IS one of the top 3 baby names in the US right now for girls, which makes me slightly inclined to still use that name if we do get pregnant and have a girl. Also, we live in a different state than my SIL and BIL. We see them 3-4 times a year maybe. But I‚Äôm very torn. I have literally never loved another little girl‚Äôs name the way I‚Äôve loved this one and now I don‚Äôt know what to do. Would I be horrible to still use the name I picked out long before meeting my SIL/BIL? I wouldn‚Äôt want to cause a weirdness between his family and he and I. But his brother was so rude when my husband mentioned that that was the same name he and I had discussed and that I‚Äôd picked out long ago. So that also makes me feel like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care, we‚Äôre using my name I came up with and loved.‚Äù ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-16,"AITA for still using the baby name I‚Äôve had picked out for 10+ years even though my new SIL is using the same name?

21,1e4ag05,AITA for calling the police on my Nephew after he stole from me and squatted in my house?,"I (45F) am in a difficult situation with my nephew (25M) and my family, and I need some perspective as I simply feel terrible about this whole situation.

Last year, my nephew lost his job and couldn't afford to stay with his friends anymore. Having helped raise him and having such a deep connection, I decided to help him out. I had recently bought a house over the summer to rent out, so I let him stay there until he could get back on his feet. I also gave him 3000 dollars to help with living expenses and such.

A few months later, he landed a job at a major tech firm, and during Thanksgiving, he bragged that his starting salary was almost as much as I've been making after 10 years in my current job. I was naturally very enthused for him and extremely proud. 

I decided after the holidays it was time for him to move on and get a place and start paying rent. As spring rolled around, I urged him to find another place to live or start paying me. I also told him we could forget the 3000 and just move on. He refused, getting really upset and saying it was convenient for him to stay since it was close to his new job and that he was not in a financial situation to be paying rent right now. Which confused me, as I previously stated he was bragging about his salary? I then offered to let him rent the property for a little more than the mortgage, which was less than what I planned to charge other tenants. He refused and has barely spoken to me since.

I really struggled, but my family insisted that I give him a 30-day notice to vacate the property, which I had notarized. He ignored it. I then started to talk about eviction. We got into another argument when I got to repainting the house (with notice) because he had scuffed up the walls, he kicked over my paint cans, ruining the carpet. I had no choice but to file for eviction, it was all simply to straining.

I had some valuables and furniture I had stored in the crawl space I'd been too afraid to move due to the tension. I found that he sold my retro games and consoles, two paintings, my dining set, and a few other things through a camera on my property. I called the police to file a report.

He came home during this completely out of his mind. They found ketamine in his system and paraphernalia and he is now facing jail time for the possession but also DUI. My family is now furious with me, blaming me for ruining his life. His parents won't talk to me, and they claim I knew he was high when I called the police when he hadn't even came home yet. They said I should have called them before the police to ""settle it"".

I feel like I did everything I could to help him until he crossed too many lines.

They didn't even tell me until the day of that they were moving out. They then messaged me saying that they wanted to come back and have a discussion about pool management.
