1,1e4icse,WIBTA if I moved out from my dads house because of my stepmom?,"AITA for not wanting to live with my stepmom?

I (18m) live with my dad (50m), my stepmom (47f) and my two younger siblings (6m and 3f). We are all from a South American country but firstly when I moved with them I had to move to the USA and one year after I had to move to an European country with them and I got some language classes that my dads job paid for (twice per week) but I was thrown at school on my own and expected to do great there with basically no knowledge on the language. This created many conflicts between us because I couldn‚Äôt understand the classes and ended up having to repeat an school year. Besides that our family life is really turbulent because of me and my stepmom. She‚Äôs very controlling. She sometimes hit my siblings and scream at them and always find something to be mad about. She‚Äôs what I‚Äôd call a clean freak and in my first years living with her she would randomly get in my room, ‚Äúinspect‚Äù the cleanliness and then not let me go out or do certain things based on her opinion on it. I help around the house with chores, btw. Before I also didn‚Äôt have a curfew and my dad didn‚Äôt have any problems with me seeing friends but because of school stuff (keep in mind I‚Äôm not fluent in the language of the country) she started controlling my free time. Now, she suddenly has a problem with my friends using our couch. They‚Äôre gone for a weekend and I watched a movie with some friends at home, nothing crazy, but now that she‚Äôs back she says the pillows smell terrible and that all my friends stink (she blames it on them being European and us Latinos) and says they‚Äôre not allowed to use our couch and need to sit on the floor if they come here.

Other things that she‚Äôs done include:

Taking away the key of my door bc she didn‚Äôt like the smell on the shirt I was wearing (it was my boyfriends shirt and she says he doesn‚Äôt know how to wash clothes).

I‚Äôm trans and when I got a boyfriend she asked me in a fight if we had anal sex or vaginal sex bc she said it was ‚Äúhypocritical‚Äù of me to have vaginal sex while identifying as a boy.

She brings up the fact that she has opinions on my gender very often and always says ‚Äúbut inside you‚Äôre a girl so‚Ä¶‚Äù

Say that I‚Äôm the reason for her having problems with my dad.

Wanting to forbid me of eating in my room because I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt deserve the privilege‚Äù.

Saying that my boyfriend will leave me bc I repeated a school year.

Also I had to hide the fact that I was having language classes for a while bc she was jealous that she had to work and couldn‚Äôt study the language (my dad and the kids are the only ones fluent at it). My dad says she is just a bit of a clean freak and has a strong personality, plus wanting to learn the language (nowadays she is in a language school and working part time) due to all this I‚Äôve been trying to find a way out of the house but idk if her behavior is actually ok or not.

2,1e4gvut,AITA for dropping two of my friends without speaking to them first?,"Sorry if this is a little messy and the spellings wrong, its 1am for me and im on phone.

So currently between a group of friends we've had a major falling out. It wasnt actually too surpising honestly. Two of the people in the group were usually major assholes.

They always talked over other people, included random people into the group drama, so on and so fourth.

One of the friends who had already left had pointed out how bad everyone generally was. And yes, that includes myself. I respect her descion on leaving the group and honestly im glad i followed her lead. 

One of the people in the group who i'll just call Lucy, would often make backhanded remarks and play it off as a joke. But as soon as someone would do the same to them, theyd throw a hissy fit. They were one of the people who tried to play victim in everything.

I personally have my own reasons for not liking them:

Tried to guess my deadname (i am ftm)- idc if it was a joke. They're under the trans umbrella as well. They know how harmful that can be.

Told me to end it when I was/am already at a low point mentally

Made fun of the fact I was crying one time and said it was 'annoying'.

Compared my friend to an abuser. Keep in mind my friend was trying to change for THEM.

Would always complain about the fact people would talk over them when theyd do the same.
That is just a short part of why i did not like Lucy, there is just so much more i could go into.

The other person who i'll call Elsa, also did things that that, i personally did not agree with.

We had a server in the group for everyone to talk and hangout with, we also had an NSFW section. And ovbiously my friends and I used to for sending NSFW artwork and stuff.

Lucy and Elsa, who said they dont feel comfortable with seeing anything NSFW related, and i 100% respected that!

But knowing that it was the NSFW chat, knowing what kind of things would be going on in there. They still went into the NSFW chat, cliked on the very much censored and labled as porn and then got mad for us for using the NSFW for NSFW.

Elsa would always seek out the smallest thing of drama

No matter what actually happened, Elsa would take Lucys side

Recently everything had gotten too much for me and my friends, so we finally dropped them. Now, i'll admit, im the greatest with talking about my feelings and confrontation, it was how i was raised. 

So i kinda just. Kicked them from the server, left any server and group chat that we had in common and unfriened them. I know it was a coward move, but it was the quickest way to get it done.

When i look at the days ive had to deal with Elsa and Lucy, all i truly see is a lot of the things that shouldve been red flags in the first place. As i stayed friends with them, my eating and sleeping habits slowly became worse and worse.

I just wanted to know if i did the right or wrong thing?

I didn't tell my family about it. I shared it on my personal profile to boost followers, didn't state that I was the author. If you know me, you could figure it out but I liked the idea of anonymity.

After a story on my blog my sister called asking probing questions to see if I would tell her about it,I said ""you found my blog"" she admitted she was reading and upset that I hadn't shared things with her.

We discussed she could see how my blog was beneficial to me and might help others in similar situations. She asked if she should stop reading it I said that probably better for our relationship. She said she would respect my privacy.

Despite our conversation she kept reading. We live in different cities and don't see each other except for holidays. At some stage she got offended by something and didn't tell me. She told Mum and everyone else that I was writing bull$h#t rubbish stories about her.... which I wasn't... she decided I was having a go at her parenting style? I don't know. Eventually after months of not talking to me, she sent me a text ""should we just have it out?""

An abusive phone call later and I was deemed ""such an awful person, completely lacking in common sense"" that she ""didn't want \[me\] in her life"" it was pretty hurtful and sent me in a downwards cycle. I'm still pretty torn up and emotional about it. And I felt like my outlet and processing means was taken away from me.

My mom:46f mom's friend: early 20s and I: 17 were at my house a few days ago. I had just gotten out of the bathtub and wanted to go into the living room because I don't like going into my room when in not fully dried off due to the air flow, when I got out of the Bathroom and went to the living room/kitchen to see my mom's friend. My mom's friend is really touchy and bothers both me and my little sis, she like to grab onto us and touch us and constantly wants us to hug her and when we tell her no she proceeds to do it anyways. Both me and my sister do not like to be physically touched randomly and I don't like the feeling of hugging people I don't know because it makes me uncomfortable. I told my mom's friend to stop touching me over and over and she was disregarding my boundaries and would not listen to the word no she was even trying to take and play on my handheld gaming system which i don't feel comfortable giving to other people. Eventually after she kept following me around the kitchen I couldnt do it anymore I lost it and said some pretty harsh words to her which I shouldn't have said and my mom yelled at me cussing me out and saying that she's the parent and she gets to decide what I do and since i would give her friend a hug she wont let me go out or do anything since i wont be nice to her but i just didnt want to be hugged and everyone is calling me an ahole for yelling at her about how i have boundaries and she needs to respect them. This happens to me and my little sis Everytime she comes over if we are out of our rooms she will hunt us down for hugs and me and my sis don't even feel comfortable coming out of our rooms when she's around.

7,1e4blvb,WIBTA for locking my husband out of our house?,"Ok, I‚Äôm feeling super petty so buckle up. 

My husband travels a shit ton, a lot of which is for work. He‚Äôs usually gone 2-3 days a week. 

When he took this job, he told me he‚Äôd cut down on his hobbies (mainly golf) because he‚Äôd be traveling so much. Two purposes - one to make sure we could still spend time together with him gone so much, and also so he‚Äôd have more time to pick up the slack because I‚Äôm pretty much doing all household management - not even just when he‚Äôs gone at this point. I cook, grocery shop, take care of the dog, do laundry, organize appointments, take care of household maintenance, car maintenance, manage our budget, etc. Hopefully you get the point, I do a lot. I don‚Äôt usually mind as long as he appreciates that I‚Äôm taking on the majority of the load there, and doesn‚Äôt do the BS of ‚ÄúWell I do a lot too!‚Äù And, the big thing, that when I ask him to do something he does it. No questions asked, no pushing it off. It. Just. Gets. Done. 

Now onto his hobbies. He spends between 20-40 hours a week playing golf. He‚Äôs good - top 5% of all golfers good. And he loves it, plus it‚Äôs something he does with friends so is a social outlet as well. Usually I‚Äôm all for it but lately it just feels wayyyy over the top. He‚Äôs been traveling a ton, letting things slide at home, and not doing anything to change it. 

Most recently, he played 2 rounds of golf between Monday and Wednesday of last week, left our house on Thursday night for a golf boys trip, and was gone until last night at which point he came home and told me he was too tired to do anything. Ok. Fair enough. I asked him to set aside time tonight because there‚Äôs like three things we need to do together. He agreed. 

Well, guess who‚Äôs currently out golfing with his buddies and texted me that he couldn‚Äôt make tonight work for getting stuff done with me? And, adding insult to injury, he‚Äôs currently at a fucking casino and all of the pots I cooked us dinner in last night that he said he‚Äôs clean this morning are still sitting on the stove, dirty. 

We have smart locks and because I am the manager of the house he doesn‚Äôt have the app to control them on his phone. I am sitting here, and all I want to do is remove all of his access codes and lock him out of the house.

8,1e4bjb3,AITA for hanging up on my mom over social media ,"As the title says, I (32f) have a mom (60f) who many would classify as ""narcissistic"" but she has never been officially diagnosed.


My dad (63m) passed from pancreatic cancer 10 months ago and he and my mom were married for 42 years, since she was 18! She has had a lot of trouble with the idea of not having him around and being by herself. Yesterday my husband and I went over to help her with a new tv and hanging a new mirror, while my husband ran to a hardware store for a few things I talked to my mom about social media. She has always been extremely against any form of social media but when I mentioned Facebook Marketplace, she immediately started signing up. She added a few family members and posted a few pictures.


Today she called me saying one of her friends posted something that basically said, ""profiles are getting hacked and they don't add me if you get a friend request..."". She said frantically that she wants to delete the friend because she's scared of getting hacked. I went and looked and it was one of those photos people post like ""Facebook is doing this, repost this in your story to stop it from happening to you.."" 
I said, ""ok this is just a thing people post. It's not a fake account, the person just posted this to ""warn"" others."" 


She suddenly started screaming at me saying I was laughing at her and I need to stop. She went from fear to complete anger. I immediately said, ""nobody is laughing."" She responded, ""yes you are, I hear you!"" Again, nobody was laughing, giggling, breathing hard, etc. so I said, ""mom if you're going to yell at me I'm going to hang up."" She firmly said, ""K."" There was silence so I took a deep breath and asked if she wants me to help. She again firmly said, ""I want you to tell me how to unfriend her."" I explained it step by step, asked her to confirm it worked and she then responded, ""okay. Unfriended."" I said ok, and hung up the phone.

9,1e4bdh0,AITA for telling my girlfriend‚Äôs roommate to mind her own business?,"My (31m) girlfriend (28F) and I have been dating for almost 3 years. During that time she has been living with her roommate Kelly (30f) in a house that Kelly‚Äôs dad owns, though my girlfriend still pays rent. They don‚Äôt have a formal lease agreement so my girlfriend can move out whenever. My own lease is coming up in about three months so I thought it would be a great time for me and my girlfriend to start looking for a new place together.

I was over at their place last week and brought up the question of us moving in together.

I told Kelly that she should mind her own business and she is obviously just using my girlfriend for rent money that she doesn‚Äôt even need, since her dad owns the house.

Kelly said that she pays rent just like my girlfriend. And my girlfriend then said that she does pay less to Kelly than she would pay to split a place with me. And that‚Äôs true BUT if she lived with me she would have a much shorter commute (5 minutes vs 20 minutes) plus actual air conditioning (their house just has window units). I tried to explain this but my girlfriend shut it down and told me to leave and we would talk later.

My girlfriend texted me later to say that I should have been nicer to Kelly since Kelly is just looking out for her, and that she feels like she should stick it out at least another year with Kelly since she ‚Äúowes her‚Äù.

10,1e4b8ix,AITA for staying neutral in in-laws divorce?,"My BIL and SIL got divorced last winter after 40 yrs.Their daughter & her husband have a huge house and asked them to move in to help raise their granddaughter.

SIL is 1 of 8 (the 8).My wife is her step sister with a different Mom.My wife never knew their father who died shortly after she was born, & grew up an only child.Her Mom sheltered her from this until she was 17, when 1 of the 8 contacted her.Some of the 8 did not want to meet her.Not all,but many still hold a grudge & refuse to have a relationship.Because of this, when she would get together with SIL and BIL,it was always separate.We were never invited to holidays  like everyone else and going to large family gatherings was awkward.SIL never confronted the 8 over their behavior,staying neutral. So even though they are step sisters, my wife has sometimes felt like an outsider. Until now, we had a good relationship with both. A few years ago the 8 divided over caring  for their ailing mother & SIL & that side cut off contact with the other side.

During the divorce, we stayed neutral. We acted as a support to both, letting SIL store her stuff at our place.We let them vent.Whatever they told us was in confidence.At one point early in the separation,SIL said ""you know, BIL will always be your BIL, even though we're not together anymore"".At some point BIL rebounds with a new gf,but doesn't tell anyone.In Jan,BIL told us about his gf.SIL calls us to fish for info, my wife reluctantly confirms,but SIL is upset we didn't tell her first.Our Son‚Äôs communion was in the Spring.My BIL asked to bring his new gf, & we said no, tried to protect SIL.SIL acted aloof, also wasn‚Äôt overly friendly at her granddaughters bday party in May.Late May SIL texts my wife:""We have to talk"".So they text back and forth in vain trying to agree on a date. Both had vacations we were working around.SIL was cold, giving terse answers.So a few days ago, my wife texts again.SIL replies back livid, furious that my wife didn't pick up the phone,didn't take her side,didn't tell her about the new gf and that we didnt ask her permission to invite her ex husband to my son's Communion,calling my wife names and saying""you can have BIL and his (derogatory) gf,someday he will dump you and when he does,I told you so"".I replied that we stayed neutral.She said only kids can stay neutral, everyone else has to take a side.I explained we see them both as our kids' Aunt and Uncle, but she feels betrayed as my wife is her ""flesh and blood"",and owed her allegiance.

11,1e4awyb,AITA Graduation Party ,"Hi everyone here's the whole long story...my daughter graduated from highschool this past month and we talked her into having a small family party. My mom passed away a few months ago and I really don't talk to a lot of my family anymore because we all got busy with our lives, we all used to be extremely close. We only see each other at funerals now and we all said we need to see each other during something happy instead of sad. I haven't invited my family to anything in a lot of years mainly because I haven't had a big enough party worth inviting anyone to. So at the funeral I asked everyone if I had a graduation party for my daughter would they like to come. Everyone said yes in some way or the other and most said we definitely need this as a family. I told them the reason I'm asking before sending out invites is so I know where to have the party at. I sincerely tried to ask who would think they would come so I could try and plan to accommodate everyone. A few weeks later I posted on FB for everyone to let me know again who would be willing to come just cause I know how emotional funerals get and people agree to things they don't mean..again I got multiple yes replies, I'm down, wouldn't miss it. Okay so now I plan the party, rent a room at a center, ground level, AC. I have accommodated everyone I can think of. I then send out the invitation almost 3 weeks before the party with an RSVP date 1 week before the party. Only 2 people respond with a I'll be there ,I wouldn't miss it. Everyone else in my family either didn't respond or just liked the picture. I even sent out mailed invites to some older family members just in case. I know some people just don't RSVP so I kinda left it to that, 1 day before the RSVP deadline I sent another post asking everyone that was coming to confirm that they are and how many people they were bringing so I know how much food I need. Now no one replied to that. Not one single one of my family members showed up, even the 2 who said they would be there when I sent the invites. I understand completely if something comes up you cant come but the complete rudeness and lack of any type of etiquette has royally pissed me off. I went off on a few of them and told them that's exactly why I stopped talking to all of you..among other things. I made the decision to not attend any family anything in the future ever. I will only attend my aunts or uncles funerals when they pass out of respect for my mom. But that's it no one else. My LO says I'm overreacting and my my cousin says I'm being a B**** and being childish. Fact is..I wouldn't have needed to rent a room to accommodate the people who came to her party, I could have had it at a park and saved money. I needed the room ONLY if my family members were going to be in attendance. Then because I had no idea if anyone was actually coming or not I had to still make sure there was enough food to feed people if they did come. So I'm just wondering AITA and overreacting?

12,1e4avap,AITA For threatening to kick out my friend for disrespecting my apartment,"I (27M) was holding a get-together with some of my old college friends to celebrate the 4th of July. It was me and my three other friends: Tom (24M), Rick (23M), and Jason (24M). I just recently bought an apartment and I'm currently working on fixing it up. It needs some touch-up here and there like painting the walls, filling up old nail holes left behind from shelves/paintings, and other small stuff like that was left behind from the previous owner. I got a couple small projects done, but I want to take my time and make everything look perfect.¬†

¬†This all started when I left with Tom and Jason to go to the store to pick up some food for later. I have known Rick for a couple of years now and thought nothing of leaving him behind. When I got back to the apartment, Rick was very apologetic and led me over to a toilet paper holder that was now on the ground. To say I was disappointed was an understatement. I had some choice words for Rick that I'm not too proud of myself for saying. Rick apologized a bunch and I eventually cooled off, but when I did finally cool off Tom decided to bring up that he had seen the holder dangling in the wall on an earlier visit. I told Tom I didn't want to hear any of it and that he was making excuses for Rick and that Rick should be held accountable for something he broke. Even if the holder was slightly broken before, Rick was the one that fully broke it. Tom told me that that didn‚Äôt matter since I was fixing everything up anyways. I told him again that I didn't want to hear it right now and that he was being very disrespectful to my apartment that I was letting the three of them sleep in.¬†

Later in the day when I finally had a chance to think about everything, I decided to apologize to Rick since he seemed generally sorry for breaking the holder. Rick accepted my apology, but then Tom doubled down and said that Rick didn‚Äôt break it. I told Tom that he was on thin ice and that was that. The rest of the night went fine.¬†

¬†The next morning, I felt bad for originally getting mad at Rick, so I decided to apologize to him again. I thought I was giving Tom an opportunity to apologize for disrespecting both me and my apartment, but no. He couldn‚Äôt get over himself and said he did nothing wrong and that he wouldn‚Äôt apologize. I told him to get out of my apartment. After some back and forward, He eventually apologized and that was the end of it.¬†

¬†I let the three of them stay at my place and they not only broke something but were disrespectful about it. I thought I warned Tom plenty to back off, but he just wouldn‚Äôt let it go. Jason even told Tom that he was making excuses for Rick. I don‚Äôt know why Tom had to make this a bigger deal than it was and why he had to join the ordeal.

When I got back to the apartment, Rick was very apologetic and led me over to a toilet paper holder that was now on the ground. To say I was disappointed was an understatement. I had some choice words for Rick that I'm not too proud of myself for saying. Rick apologized a bunch and I eventually cooled off, but when I did finally cool off Tom decided to bring up that he had seen the holder dangling in the wall on an earlier visit. I told Tom I didn't want to hear any of it and that he was making excuses for Rick and that Rick should be held accountable for something he broke. Even if the holder was slightly broken before, Rick was the one that fully broke it. Tom told me that that didn‚Äôt matter since I was fixing everything up anyways. I told him again that I didn't want to hear it right now and that he was being very disrespectful to my apartment that I was letting the three of them sleep in.¬†

Later in the day when I finally had a chance to think about everything, I decided to apologize to Rick since he seemed generally sorry for breaking the holder. Rick accepted my apology, but then Tom doubled down and said that Rick didn‚Äôt break it. I told Tom that he was on thin ice and that was that. The rest of the night went fine.¬†

¬†The next morning, I felt bad for originally getting mad at Rick, so I decided to apologize to him again. I thought I was giving Tom an opportunity to apologize for disrespecting both me and my apartment, but no. He couldn‚Äôt get over himself and said he did nothing wrong and that he wouldn‚Äôt apologize. I told him to get out of my apartment. After some back and forward, He eventually apologized and that was the end of it.¬†

¬†I let the three of them stay at my place and they not only broke something but were disrespectful about it. I thought I warned Tom plenty to back off, but he just wouldn‚Äôt let it go. Jason even told Tom that he was making excuses for Rick. I don‚Äôt know why Tom had to make this a bigger deal than it was and why he had to join the ordeal. I thought my actions were justified at the time, but after talking it out with a couple other friends, I'm not too sure.",1.0,0.99108094,1,1
13,1e4as2b,WIBTA if I contacted former roommate for some of the money she left owing?,"I never once thought I would be posting here for advice. I 40'sF and my husband 40's M have recently found ourselves in the worst financial hardship we have ever faced in nearly 11 years together and I am at a total loss as to what to do just to keep our heads above water at this point.

As I have seen on many of these, this is where I would add in the backstory so I will make this as brief as possible. Husband and I agreed to help a longtime friend out of a very bad marriage. The three of us talked, agreed upon terms such as rent and groceries and then moved her into our spare bedroom. 

In the beginning, my husband was on a break from working trying to decide what he wanted to do for work as his last job had abruptly ended due to the sale of the business. She and I were both working full time, so it wasn't a big issue. Things took a turn when my husband started working again and then shortly after her divorce finally went to court to be finalized. We supported her and even took her out to dinner to celebrate her freedom and all seemed to be happy.

Suddenly when her divorce finalized, she stopped helping with anything in the house, groceries housework cooking. She even seemed to suddenly ""forget"" to pay her agreed rent. To the point of, she would deduct from her rent if she bought anything for the house like toilet paper or dog food. 

I recently had to quit my job due to the toll it had been taking on my health. The three of us had long talks about the financial impact it would be losing my income for a few months. Both my husband and roommate assured me that we would be ok with the two of them working. Once it was official I was taking some time off from work, and another round of 'where's the rent' she gave a few excuses and the next weekend with no forewarning, her daughter just shows up to help her move out. She left telling husband ""Thank you for giving me time and space to heal"" and without a word to me just left and she has been avoiding me since. 

Last week, husband's job has run out as there just wasn't enough work doing maintenance at this time. He has been putting in applications and today he had a promising interview, but it is still a wait and see.

This brief summary now brings us to today, where I sit here near tears with stress about having a negative balance in my account and nowhere to turn. Where I live, we don't have city emergency type resources. Churches don't offer assistance for bills or anything like that. Our circle of friends is so small that I truly have nobody nearby to turn to for any type of help.

14,1e4arqc,AITA for getting a wedding canceled by sending a video to the bride,"TLDR: I supplied my future aunt-in-law with proof that a cousin is talking shit about her which caused one of the wedding celebrations to be canceled.

My uncle Jay(28M) is marrying Mel(26F). She's shy so she never wanted a big wedding where she has to walk down the aisle etc. She wants to elope with just him and her and also have a traditional wedding from her country. He's completely cool with doing things how she wants it.

But Jay's mom, Amanda, wants the typical wedding. Mel conceded that she was okay with having an additional third wedding where Amanda could do all the planning and Mel would veto anything she didn't like. Cost-wise, it's no issue because the other two weddings are essentially free.

The problem started when Amanda was showing Mel the bridesmaid list. There were going to be 7 bridesmaids, and one of them was Jay's cousin Leti (27F). Leti has been nothing but rude to Mel since the day they met. She constantly makes little digs at her, talks shit about her, and overall makes it clear that she does not like her.

So Mel immediately vetoed it. Leti was in the room sitting with them during the veto and threw a fit, talking about how Mel is always rude to her. I can vouch for Mel and say that she never chooses to interact with Leti in any way shape/form. What she does do is whenever Leti makes a snide comment, she makes a direct comment back in response. So to an outsider, it might seem like Mel is being hostile but to everyone in the family, it's a roll-your-eyes moment where we know Leti is the asshole, and Mel just isn't taking it.

Leti tried to claim that Mel has been holding a grudge based on the first week of them meeting, but then Mel pulled out a video (that I sent her:/) of Leti talking shit about her just a couple of days ago. In it, Leti's calling her a bitch and saying stuff like she's not even that pretty, etc). Amanda sees this and immediately starts minimizing it saying oh she didn't mean that and so on.

At this point, I think Mel has had enough because everyone in the family knows how Leti acts towards her, but they never take it seriously. They only slightly tell Leti off and are always trying to convince Mel to not take it to heart. So Mel says that she's sorry but the wedding is off. She's still going to marry Jay in the other two originally planned ways, but she's not going to do Amanda's version anymore. She says this all nicely (as always) but Amanda is now crying, Leti's screaming at everyone, and other family members are saying that Mel should learn how to take a joke.

Days later, I said I was the one who sent Mel the video and now a couple of family members are mad at me for getting involved. Was I the asshole here?

15,1e4ar3l,AITA for insisting my friends pay for their two sons as adults on group trips?,"I (38F) often travel with friends who share my interests, including a couple (50M and 50F) with two children (now 15M and 11M). Initially, we counted the boys as one person when dividing expenses because they were younger (around 9 and 6).

However, this has raised questions on subsequent trips, although no one has directly addressed the parents. The boys usually get their own room, order what they want, and participate in shared meals. Some friends have privately asked why they only pay for one child.

On our last trip, they initially planned to bring one son but ended up bringing both. They only paid for three places in our rental home instead of four, which not everyone agreed with. This also meant we needed to bring an extra car.

During the trip, the parents privately asked if we thought it was fair for their youngest son, Jaime, to pay the same as an adult, given he eats less. While Jaime is picky, their older son, Oliver, eats more than most adults. The mother even joked, ‚ÄúWhatever Jaime doesn‚Äôt eat, Oliver will finish!‚Äù

We mostly ate in the house but had one special night out where Jaime didn't like the food and didn‚Äôt eat much. It didn‚Äôt occur to me at the time to exclude him from the bill (I‚Äôm a vegetarian and didn‚Äôt eat the steak but still paid my share). At other meals, Jaime ordered individual plates similar to the rest of us. I also believe it was the parents‚Äô responsibility to bring up the subject with the whole group.

Regarding other meals, Jaime and Oliver usually had cereal and milk while the adults ate more substantial breakfasts. Their parents often commented on our breakfast portions compared to the boys. Lunches and dinners were similar in portion size, though the boys didn‚Äôt drink alcohol. For context, I brought four bottles of wine and didn‚Äôt include them in expenses, and we bought beer, averaging 4-5 beers per adult over the week.

After returning home, the parents expressed their hurt that we didn‚Äôt offer to reduce some expenses since the boys didn‚Äôt eat as much as the adults. I pointed out that they hadn‚Äôt paid an equal share for the house and that Jaime and Oliver are at an age where they should be included as adults. Other friends have commented on this too. While I understand it‚Äôs expensive to travel as a family of four, both parents have well-paying jobs.

In the evening of day 1, he asked me if I‚Äôd feel okay with him going clubbing with the rest of the group and leaving me at home. I can usually get into bars with an edited photo for a fake. He didn‚Äôt think I could get in the NYC clubs.  A friend of mine at NYU confirmed, saying I‚Äôd have better luck in lower Manhattan. My boyfriend had already pre ordered tickets someplace else (without consulting me or the other girl in our group). I felt no point in suggesting we try to get me in or anything.

I believe everyone should get to do what they want to, and that we should have full autonomy over ourselves. I also enjoy my time alone tbh.

19,1e4am6v,AITAH for complaining about my other friends to one of my close friends?,"(I'll use fake names for the people's privacy.)

When me and my friend (who I will call Joshua) hung out, at some point it would always come to the topic of our other friends. My mother taught me to never talk bad about my friends, so at first when Joshua started to complain about things our other friends did, I was a bit uncomfortable to say the least. After a bit of us being friends and hanging out, I was used to the complaining about our other friends and had forgotten that it had been a bit bad to do. It got to that topic once again and we complained about how our other friend (I will call him Ryan) hadn't cleaned himself properly and how he had an unhealthy living condition in his room. I was concerned for him and I was trying to stear away from the topic a bit,  but it would always come back to complaining about Ryan in particular. Eventually I vented to Joshua that sometimes Ryan was a bit annoying and he had agreed. I really liked Ryan as a friend but I didn't know how to feel about him as a whole because of how he was living and how he acted sometimes. I thought of this as normal venting at this point because Joshua had made it so normal for me. I vented to him about my depression and how our friends were doing things I didn't quite like. He made it to be a safe space for the both of us to vent to each other. (Side note, Joshua told me all of our friends secrets which I probably shouldn't know.) I did try to help Ryan with his living condition, but it got so bad I would almost gag anytime I entered his house. Now recently, Joshua texted me how he didn't want to be friends anymore because all I did was complain about our friends.

When me and my friend (who I will call Joshua) hung out, at some point it would always come to the topic of our other friends. My mother taught me to never talk bad about my friends, so at first when Joshua started to complain about things our other friends did, I was a bit uncomfortable to say the least. After a bit of us being friends and hanging out, I was used to the complaining about our other friends and had forgotten that it had been a bit bad to do. It got to that topic once again and we complained about how our other friend (I will call him Ryan) hadn't cleaned himself properly and how he had an unhealthy living condition in his room. I was concerned for him and I was trying to stear away from the topic a bit,  but it would always come back to complaining about Ryan in particular. Eventually I vented to Joshua that sometimes Ryan was a bit annoying and he had agreed. I really liked Ryan as a friend but I didn't know how to feel about him as a whole because of how he was living and how he acted sometimes. I thought of this as normal venting at this point because Joshua had made it so normal for me. I vented to him about my depression and how our friends were doing things I didn't quite like. He made it to be a safe space for the both of us to vent to each other. (Side note, Joshua told me all of our friends secrets which I probably shouldn't know.) I did try to help Ryan with his living condition, but it got so bad I would almost gag anytime I entered his house. Now recently, Joshua texted me how he didn't want to be friends anymore because all I did was complain about our friends. All of our friends in that group now currently don't like me and are sticking on Joshua's side because he won't admit that he had complained about our friends as well.

So I wanted to use the female version of my grandfather‚Äôs name as our baby‚Äôs first name (assuming we have a girl one day) and my grandmother‚Äôs first name as the baby‚Äôs middle name. The two names just go so perfectly together, and it‚Äôs what I‚Äôd wanted to name my future baby girl for at least 10 years.

21,1e4ag05,AITA for calling the police on my Nephew after he stole from me and squatted in my house?,"I (45F) am in a difficult situation with my nephew (25M) and my family, and I need some perspective as I simply feel terrible about this whole situation.

Last year, my nephew lost his job and couldn't afford to stay with his friends anymore. Having helped raise him and having such a deep connection, I decided to help him out. I had recently bought a house over the summer to rent out, so I let him stay there until he could get back on his feet. I also gave him 3000 dollars to help with living expenses and such.

A few months later, he landed a job at a major tech firm, and during Thanksgiving, he bragged that his starting salary was almost as much as I've been making after 10 years in my current job. I was naturally very enthused for him and extremely proud. 

I decided after the holidays it was time for him to move on and get a place and start paying rent. As spring rolled around, I urged him to find another place to live or start paying me. I also told him we could forget the 3000 and just move on. He refused, getting really upset and saying it was convenient for him to stay since it was close to his new job and that he was not in a financial situation to be paying rent right now. Which confused me, as I previously stated he was bragging about his salary? I then offered to let him rent the property for a little more than the mortgage, which was less than what I planned to charge other tenants. He refused and has barely spoken to me since.

I really struggled, but my family insisted that I give him a 30-day notice to vacate the property, which I had notarized. He ignored it. I then started to talk about eviction. We got into another argument when I got to repainting the house (with notice) because he had scuffed up the walls, he kicked over my paint cans, ruining the carpet. I had no choice but to file for eviction, it was all simply to straining.

I had some valuables and furniture I had stored in the crawl space I'd been too afraid to move due to the tension. I found that he sold my retro games and consoles, two paintings, my dining set, and a few other things through a camera on my property. I called the police to file a report.

He came home during this completely out of his mind. They found ketamine in his system and paraphernalia and he is now facing jail time for the possession but also DUI. My family is now furious with me, blaming me for ruining his life. His parents won't talk to me, and they claim I knew he was high when I called the police when he hadn't even came home yet.

27,1e534fy,AITA for spending my baby shower money? ,"My husband & I are expecting a baby girl in August. A couple weeks ago, my mom suggested a small baby shower w/ my family & the church. A time frame was suggested, but never confirmed. My understanding was since my mom had suggested it, she would be planning the event, & since I had not heard anything from her, I assumed the plan was a bust. Fast forward to last week. She told me she was cleaning her house for the party. I asked when it was, & she said July 14th. I asked if she had told the church yet. She said no. I told her that I only had about $150 to use since I was saving for a trip. She said to just spend what I had, (which was $300,) & she would reimburse me before my trip. Luckily, everyone brought food, so there was plenty to eat. 

My mom used my brother‚Äôs credit card for the party, mostly on food. She spent maybe $300, so similar to what I had spent. She also spent $200 on a grill, since hers was missing. My solution to was to grab her old grill from the church or buy a cheap grill. She refused & got a pricier grill.

So AITA for spending my baby shower money?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-16,"AITA for spending my baby shower money?  My husband & I are expecting a baby girl in August. A couple weeks ago, my mom suggested a small baby shower w/ my family & the church. A time frame was suggested, but never confirmed. My understanding was since my mom had suggested it, she would be planning the event, & since I had not heard anything from her, I assumed the plan was a bust. Fast forward to last week. She told me she was cleaning her house for the party. I asked when it was, & she said July 14th. I asked if she had told the church yet. She said no. I told her that I only had about $150 to use since I was saving for a trip. She said to just spend what I had, (which was $300,) & she would reimburse me before my trip. Luckily, everyone brought food, so there was plenty to eat. 

My mom used my brother‚Äôs credit card for the party, mostly on food. She spent maybe $300, so similar to what I had spent. She also spent $200 on a grill, since hers was missing. My solution to was to grab her old grill from the church or buy a cheap grill. She refused & got a pricier grill. She also spent another $100 AFTER the baby shower ended on stuff for s‚Äômores for my siblings. Again, this was all done on my brother‚Äôs credit card. A total of $600.

28,1e52ped,AITAH: All my friend talks about is her son,"I do not have any children but I love being an auntie to my friends children. My friend has a one-year-old kid (Jack). Ever since finding out she was pregnant she has involved me in her celebrations and communications that are usually reserved for close family. I felt honoured and excited for her. I was invited to her family gender reveal party and was sent scan photos and kept updated on the size and development of the little squish. I went to visit once he was born and was told that I would be welcome at any time. This was all lovely and I really enjoy being a part of their lives in this way.

However, a few things during her pregnancy started niggling at me. She would tell me every single time she threw up from morning sickness. Every time. Sending me paragraphs about the food she ate and whether it was that that made her sick. At first I responded but after 6 months of daily messages like this, it became quite difficult. Every conversation ended up referring to her pregnancy and the baby. I couldn‚Äôt talk about anything without her changing the subject to it. This was exhausting before Jack even arrived, but I didn‚Äôt say anything. She was a first-time mum and I could understand her anxiety and excitement.

Once he was here she added me to an app where she could send photos and she posted several photos a day. If I didn‚Äôt message her about these photos, she would then send the same ones to me directly. While I did enjoy receiving updates, this seemed to get out of hand as that's how every conversation started from her side. 

For my birthday she got me a printed photo of me and Jack for me to display in my flat as my main gift. Meanwhile I got her gifts for her birthday that I knew she‚Äôd like for herself, not just her as a mum.¬†

Last year my mental health got really bad and I ended up on meds and in therapy. She knew about this and when told her I wasn‚Äôt doing great, her response was to only send me photos of her son to ""cheer me up"".

Most of the time I go to hang out, we play with Jack, get him ready for bed and once he‚Äôs in bed she sits, chats about him and shows me more photos of him. 

At the weekend I introduced her and her partner to my new partner. They made small talk but spent most of the time talking about their son. They didn‚Äôt really make much effort to get to know my partner. Afterwards she sent a message, and I was hoping she'd tell me what she thinks of my partner but it was more photos of their son and a paragraph about what he‚Äôd done that day.

30,1e5292m,AITAH for having a shower?,"So, for the past few nights, every time I've went for a shower, the showerhead (which is on a stiff joint kind of thing, so it can be angled up or down) is all the way down, so if the water is turned on, it aims straight for the shower itself, so I have to move it upwards before showering.

My mom said before that after I've showered, the showerhead is aiming down towards the shower even though it wasn't like that when I was showering.

Just now, she went mad at me and yelled at me saying she's going to kick me out if this keeps happening, pointing to the showerhead being fully down, again, when I was showering an hour or so ago, it wasn't like that, it was angled normally.

I said calmly (I didn't raise my voice or really show any emotion in my voice during this) ""it wasn't like that when I was showering."" she said I was doing it on purpose, and I then said ""why? I need to shower so why would I do that, don't you think your accusation is stupid?"" and she said ""probably to mess with me or give me a heart attack"".

I've been diagnosed with heart problems last year but I'm on heart medication. I said I would record myself while showering so she can see that I'm not moving the showerhead fully downwards. She said ""you don't need to record yourself, who else could be moving it? It's stiff""

I literally am not moving it, it's always in the normal position while showering, and it's somehow moving downwards while I'm not using it, at least for the past few days. I'm already stressed out today after being accused of using AI for my art online.

From now on, I'm going to be recording myself every time I get out of the shower, with a shot of the showerhead in it. (The bathroom being steamy would confirm that I've just showered.)

She recently came to visit and told me that she had already terminated her lease and was moving into my house next month. She then asked if it was okay for her to stay for 3 months. I told her it was fine, but I was really in shock. She then said the support she got from the government was just enough for bills, and she couldn't save anything after.

40,1e51lno,AITA for remaining seated during a standing ovation at my girlfriend's favourite musical? ,"I (27M) just saw ""Come From Away"" with my girlfriend (23F). I had been looking forward to seeing this musical live for some time as it's my girlfriend's favourite and she's a big fan of musicals. I don't usually go to live shows like this, but I've been a few times with her and have always enjoyed it. Prior to attending Come From Away I had no idea what it was about - personally this is how I most like to engage with media. I found that there were really good performances but the music wasn't particularly memorable and overall it lacked impact for me.

The musical comes to a close and the audience erupts into applause - I join in and clap along to show my appreciation for the performers on stage who had done a great job. But then one by one, people in the audience start standing up around me for an ovation. I decided to stay seated as I'd been more impressed by the other shows my girlfriend and I had seen together. I have always thought standing ovations were meant for truly exceptional performances. 

I thought to myself ""these people won't stand for that long and on principle I don't really feel like being peer pressured into standing up"". So I stayed seated.

But then everyone around me stood up, including my girlfriend, leaving me as probably the only person in the audience who wasn't part of the standing ovation.

""Any second now they'll sit down"" I thought - but no. The packed theatre of spectators kept clapping and whooping for like 2 or 3 minutes- there was some more music being played on stage. And the entire time all I had was a view of someone's buttcheeks in front of me. My girlfriend (and others) looked down at me a few times sort of laughing and I didn't really know what to do. But I'm not overly familiar with ovation etiquette and I don't like just following the social pressure, so I awkwardly stayed seated.

On the walk home she keeps asking why I didn't like the show. But I did like the show... I just didn't super super like it! She says she doesn't want to talk much about my thoughts because she's afraid I'll be a negative nancy and ruin it for her. She seems put out, and I feel kind of guilty that I was a party pooper at the end of a performance she thought was amazing.

In the last few years my ex's business has taken off and he's gone from living in poverty for most his life to being considerably well off. 

This year, in addition to taking all his kids on a family vacation, he's taking them each on a seperate trip.

Our daughter had the first trip, they spent 3 days in Disneyland together plus 3 days in LA. I live in southern California and my ex-lives in northern California, we used to live in LA. My daughter has been to Disneyland about 10 times and has spent a lot of time in LA. However, at the time she was very happy with her trip as she got to spend a good chunk of one on one time with her dad and he spent a lot of money on her shopping in LA.

Ryan had the second trip, a week road tripping in Mexico surfing, diving with sharks, and other cool stuff. 

Most recently, Daniel got a trip to Florida for 10 days, spending part of the vacation in Universal Studios and the other doing some outdoorsy stuff. 

Marcus has been begging his dad to take him to Japan and his dad just called me to let me know he wanted to take him to Tokyo in September.

Although my daughter was initially happy with her vacation she's now been vocally upset that she got what she sees as a less good trip to her brothers. I told her that I agreed. The boys all got to do something new that they haven't done before and probably won't do again (at least for a while). Bella and I have already been to LA three times this summer break and I'm already planning on taking her to Disneyland at the end of summer with my sister and her kids. 

Her trip was still special but I completely understand why she's feeling short changed when looking at the trips her brothers are getting. She obviously used the fact I agreed with her to try and guilt him into a second vacation and when we spoke on the phone he was annoyed that I had told her I agreed with her.

We actually argued over it for a while as he doesn't agree that the boys trips are better and highlighted that he already spent a lot of money on Bella during their trip and that she's acting spoilt. He thinks I've been an asshole disagreeing with him in front of the kids and making him look bad.

We actually argued over it for a while as he doesn't agree that the boys trips are better and highlighted that he already spent a lot of money on Bella during their trip and that she's acting spoilt. He thinks I've been an asshole disagreeing with him in front of the kids and making him look bad.

I wouldn't have second guessed myself but my husband has actually said he agrees with my ex and shouldn't have let Bella know I agreed with her. AITA?",2.0,0.9984500408172607,1,0

I said sure thing.

I work from home, so I spend most of my time here. I don‚Äôt mind; I‚Äôm quite reserved and I go out whenever I feel like it.

Our arrangement is pretty sweet. We pay 50/50 for utilities, we divided  the house into two sections which we are each responsible of cleaning, we prepare our food separately, and our bedrooms are well apart so that privacy is not an issue.

Couple months ago, he told me he wanted to introduce us, and also asked if it was ok with me if she could spend some nights over. I said I wouldn‚Äôt mind as long as she doesn‚Äôt make any messes, and intimacy is kept quiet. He agreed.

Sounds reasonable.

I took my brother aside and told him that if she plans to stay here for such a long time, then she needs to start doing chores and pay for a portion of the utilities.

He got pissed at me and told me he was already cleaning after her, and that I was being too stingy for wanting to charge her for utilities. I replied that these things are not free, and our bills will increase with a third person in the mix; it‚Äôs no longer 50/50.

45,1e50wmp,AITA for distancing from a friend after her divorce?,"I (31F) have been friends with X(35M) for about a decade. We have become almost like family before he met his ex-wife.
I didn't get along with her at first but we got through the bullshit & became very close, basically best friends.
They seemed to have a few issues while they were dating, but they kept progressing.
We had our covid weddings months apart, & they were one of the only friends we invited.

Anyway, I don't have a lot of friends, and 0 girl friends, so I was so happy to finally have a close girl friend.

When things really hit the fan & they were getting divorced, it was hard.
I was happy my friend was out of a bad relationship, but still I knew it was the end of my friendship.

This guy that I've been friends with for 10 yrs, who's family took me in, now needed a place to crash for a month or so.

My husband & I were happy to help him out & let him crash, we understood he wasn't interested in being a 30+ y.o moving back with mom & dad. They would just say ""I told you so, we never liked her anyway"" & make it harder.

My first instinct is to reach out to my friend and make sure she's okay. But I knew with something like this, I didn't want to bombard her either. I still wanted to be her friend, but I knew how that would be near impossible. I only knew her because of him, maybe she didn't want to be reminded of that time in her life.

I did reach out and say ""I'm sorry and I'm here for you"" but I kept my distance and told myself to not force it. She's probably being asked a million questions and I know if it were me, I would be inconsolable and want to shut out the world, so I waited for her to come to me when the dust finally settled.

She never reached out.

I occasionally sent her some posts on social media to let her know I was thinking of her, maybe something to make her laugh.
Sometimes, she would react or even send me something, but eventually she stopped responding.

I wished her happy holidays when the time of year came around and she did respond, but that was the first time we spoke in months and now it's been over a year.

I follow her on Instagram & root for her from afar.

Recently, she did an anonymous Q&A and someone asked if she thinks anyone is sending her ex any info.

It made me sick to think she might think I was betraying her friendship that way.

Idk if I should‚Äôve done this or not but I replied to her story and let her know I would never do that and that I'm still here for her despite our lack of contact. She said that while she appreciates the sentiment, I clearly picked sides because I actively helped her ex & haven't reached out in over a year.

I tried to tell her a little from my perspective, that I reached out a few times but it wasn't my place to force a relationship on her & she didn‚Äôt reach out either. I gave her space & the more time that went on, the harder it was to start up again.

I still miss having her as my friend but it feels like I'd be betraying my friend of a decade to even talk to her.

I do ask occasionally, but not frequently, and this bothers her. She find sit very rude of me to not include anyone else in this process. To be clear, when I do order food for her as well, she covers the order for both of us, sending me the amount through Zelle. 

In my head, I don't find this as rude at all. She also has DD, if she wants something she can order it at any time.  My mother also advocates for not using DD or eating fast food often, as it's expensive, and always says ""we have leftovers to eat for dinner"" when she calls my dad on his way home from work, so often it seems to me like she actively has different plans for eating than I do. I ordered food for myself using my account and money, and she was even out of the room when I did it. Why do I owe it to her to ask if she wants anything too? I understand that its a *nice* thing to offer, but not doing a nice thing doesn't make the other decision automatically bad or rude. She gets on my case about this often, and honestly I think she's the rude one for acting entitled to me going out of my way to ask if she wants food. This has been a repeated issue, with her getting mad that I order myself food and not ask others if I'm in the room with them, if they're not in the same room as me, or even if I order while she isn't home. 

This disagreement has led to arguments countless times, and its starting to make me wonder if maybe I am the asshole for only ordering food for myself. It's not a big deal to take orders for her and the whole family, and I do get reimbursed for it when I do, but I just don't think its rude to just do it for myself, especially if I'm ordering from places I know my family doesn't always like, or when I know there are different plants for dinner for my parents.

51,1e50hqi,AITA for telling my step mother she can‚Äôt bring her own wine to my wedding?,"I (29F) am getting married in a few months. 

A few days ago my step mom asked what alcohol would be at the wedding and I shared that we‚Äôre doing an open bar with signature cocktails, beer, wine, and liquor. She asked what kind of wine would be there and I said I wasn‚Äôt familiar with the type, but it would be a house red and white.
She said she and my dad and our family friends are very particular about the type of Chardonnay they like, and I told her I planned to surprise my dad (who contributed a generous amount to the wedding) by selecting a nice bottle or two of Chardonnay from their specialty wine menu to have just for them.
She asked if there would be enough for her friends, and I said that the bottles were about $80 each so I was only going to get 2, not enough for many people. (There is no cheaper Chardonnay option on their menu, all of their specialty wine is pretty expensive).

She then asked if she could bring their own. I told her I would have no idea if she just stuck some in her purse - but she said she was thinking about bringing a cooler with a few bottles.

I told her that it was a pretty nice venue and she‚Äôd feel uncomfortable doing so - would she do this for my cousins wedding (which was super nice) we went to a few months ago? 
She totally came unglued and stomped off. 

I was totally calm throughout and really think I was as calm as I typed out here. That said, what she said IMO really reads to me that she thinks my wedding is going to be cheap and her friends are very well off and won‚Äôt want to drink the crap wine we‚Äôre serving.

My dad asked me the same question a few weeks ago and I gave him the same answer, and he was like ‚Äúok cool np‚Äù. He and my brother didn‚Äôt hear this conversation but think I didn‚Äôt need to say (basically) that she wouldn‚Äôt do it at my cousins wedding why would she do it at mine?

What surprised me is that during the rehearsal dinner and party, my girlfriend spent most of the night mingling and talking with all of the guests but never brought me along with her to so. It very much felt like we were both there but not as a couple. I spent the night standing/sitting by myself unless I happened to run into family members of hers that I had met before and chatted with them until they continued on making the rounds.

The night rolls around and they both show up and I excitedly greet everyone, obviously Fox would tell my brother she would be coming over but when he came downstairs to greet her he made comments about how this was planned without him knowing (I had also told everyone in the house that afternoon that the girls would be popping around later, i had gone out to buy snacks and everything). I just brushed it off as him joking and we went about our night, ate popcorn and watched our movie, yes my brother watched with us, obviously next to his girlfriend.

I know her sounds like a üö©, it‚Äôs only me as his sister where this has been a problem no where else! I often do things with them as like their ‚Äòchild‚Äô and third wheel so it‚Äôs a known fact that we all have a great relationship. He‚Äôs a pretty relaxed guy which is why i was confused that he had a problem that his own sister would want to hang out with her. My mom is pretty chilled too, idk why she was phased by it tho lol. If this aids the discussion at all we are from a brown muslim household.",0.0,1.0552879571914673,1,0
57,1e4zxbp,AITA For Wanting My Parents To Actually Care About Spending Time With Me?,"I keep having the same issues with my (34M) parents (60s M&F). They (mostly my mom, but my dad mostly either just echoes what she says or doesn't contribute anything) always say all they want is for us to spend quality time together, but it seems to me like it has to be on their terms. I invite them to my house for birthdays, holidays, random weekends, and they seem to always have a reason why they can't come. But whenever they want me to come to spend time with them on their terms, either at their apartment, or at a restaurant near them, and I have a conflict, it becomes this huge issue. It is making me crazy. 

It feels like they say they want to spend time together, but what they really want is for me to show fealty to them, and ""pay respects"" to them as parents, by making a ""pilgrimage"" to their turf. I have dogs that can only be left alone for about 6 hours at a time, and they are not welcome where my parents live, which makes going to them logistically difficult.

58,1e4zwkq,"AITA for snapping at my husband in front of his family, and revealing that he hasn't help me like he claims?","Hi everyone.

For my whole life, I (30F) have had a lot of anxiety when it comes to driving. It has never been too much of a problem, as I live in a city and I can walk wherever I need to go I have been married to my husband, ""Stan"" (32M) for three years, together for six. Throughout our relationship, he has tried to help me learn how to drive. The problem is, Stan is not a very good teacher amd gets very impatient, and angry everytime we try. We go to the parking lot of an abandoned warehouse sometimes, it's huge. Anyway, if I make one small mistake, for example, if i don't check my mirrors for a long enough time. Stan yells at me. 

I would already BE nervous at the wheel, but with all the yelling, it would cause me to break down and cry. I have a brother, Paul (33M) who I hang out with typically once a week. A few months ago,  I was talking to Paul about how I want to learn how to drive, but I'm very nervous about it. He offered to help teach me when we hang out. Paul's husband, Chris also was willing to help me out, and they actually made me feel so much more at ease behind the wheel. I thought I was bad at driving, but it turns out, I was just anxious. 

Another factor that made me want to learn besides feeling like I need to do this, is that Stan has told me that he won't have a child with me until I get my license, which I definitely understand. Two weeks ago, on my day off from work, Paul and Chris took me to the DMV and I finally got my license!! I also bought a used car a few days ago from money that I've been saving up for years. I'm so happy and I have has the support from my brother and his husband. 

I thought Stan would be mad that I did all of this behind his back. And he was somewhat disappointed that I didn't want his help. I love him so much, but honestly he wasn't the right teacher for me. 

Anyway, on Sunday, Stan and I both had off from work and he told me he had a surprise for me. He took me to his parents house, where they had a celebration for me, basically like a little party congratulating me because I learned how to drive. Halfway through, my mother in law was giving a speech about how proud she was of me, but also proud of my husband, for all of thr support and lessons he was giving me. I could feel the anger rising in my chest. Stan had been telling everyone that HE was the one who has been teaching me to drive. I snapped and told everyone, basically that the fee times Stan tried to teach me, I always ended up crying because he would yell at me until he was blue in the face. That the ONLY people who helped me and gave me confidence were Paul and Chris. And that, if anything... Stan made things worse for me. Which was true. But now, Stan won't talk to me.

When I was born, my dad got to choose my first name and my mom got to choose my middle name. The middle name my mom chose for me is after her mom/ my grandmother. Unfortunately, my grandmother ended up being the main source of trauma for me throughout my childhood and even into some parts of my adult life. 

She was extremely mentally, verbally, and emotionally abusive with a terrible alcohol addiction and untreated mental health issues. She wasn't only like this towards me, she was like this towards my siblings and my mother as well. I did get it the worst out of all of us, though. I have not spoken to her since I was 18, and my mother and my siblings just recently kind of started talking to her again. I could write a novel on the details of everything that she did, but I'm not going to make you guys read all of that. 

I have always hated my middle name, since it is after her. All of my siblings have middle names after amazing family members, then I got her for my middle name to the after. Every single time I have had to tell someone my middle name or write it down on forms, it just makes me cringe. 

I want to legally change my middle name to something else. I've wanted to since middle school, but before becoming an adult my parents would have had to file the petition for me and I know my mother would have thrown a fit if I would have asked her to do that because she is the one that chose my middle name (yes I know I stated that my mother's relationship with my grandmother is strained too, but my mother has her own set of mental health problems and she takes the littlest things personally even if they're not an attack on her).

When I became an adult at 18, I still wanted to do it and could at that point do it on my own, but have always been afraid of the backlash I may get from certain family members. I know my dad & his side of the family won't care at all because my parents divorced when I was in elementary school and my dad & his side of the family absolutely hate my grandmother for what she did to me, but I know my mom will be upset because she chose my middle name and then my siblings will think doing that would be mean because they are a bit more forgiving towards our grandmother than I am. So this has held me back.

Now at 25, I have built up more courage to do it because I know it will make me happy and I won't have the name of the person that put me through hell attached to me for the rest of my life, but I still worry slightly about potential backlash.

In my inexperience with these things, I may have gone a bit overboard and gotten an excessively big one, but my sister - the person I'm going on vacation with - just joked about it, without actually complaining, so I assumed it was fine. If she had told me that it was too big I would've absolutely gone and returned it, but she didn't.

Imagine my surprise when today my mom verbally attacked me out of nowhere, accusing me of not knowing how to coexist with other people, of being and incredibily selfish asshole and only thinking about myself, saying that it was unacceptable and I had to return the suitcase and get a smaller one. Why? Because she saw the duffle bag my sister just bought for herself because her suitcase wouldn't fit in the car along with mine.

I was flabbergasted, and I understand in hindsight that I *have* made a dumb mistake, and I should have gone shopping with my sister in tow, in order to get something suitable for the both of us. Of course, I felt bad about having basically forced my sister to downgrade because of my upgrade, and I apologized to her and offered to use my old, smaller suitcase anyway, but get this: she told me her old suitcase was already falling apart, and she *chose* to buy herself a duffel bag, which is also super huge, like it could easily fit me curled up inside, and she is happy about her purchase and completely comfortable with me using the stupidly big suitcase I stupidly bought. 

She said she'd tried making our mom understand that, but she wouldn't have it and decided to be offended about it in her place and to insult me like that. The only thing that got her to calm down and stop yelling at me was both my sister and my father promising her that I would end up regretting my purchase once I found out how heavy it would be once full.

I finally convinced myself that maybe I was wrong, I tried to open up to him, but he was cold & then he started asking me about my plans.

I said I intend to go to school & a job wasn't a priority. He started trying to argue with me, scolding me that I could get a job. I explained I already knew, that's why I said it's not a priority, getting some qualifications for something more is, that doesn't necessarily exclude me getting a job.

I had a job before & he'd always bash me for not going to college, which I took into consideration, but also wondered if it was an excuse to bash me. I had been avoiding telling him because I anticipated he would bash me.

""Why are you arguing with me? You seem to agree with the basic premise of what I said?"" My cousin glared at me and said with contempt. ""Well, good, fine! Go ahead and do that!"" rolling his eyes annoyed.

I finally got fed up & I exploded ""WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM WITH ME?""

""You want to go outside and fight?"" he said, provoking me to

""I don't want to fight you, I want to know what your problem with me is?""

My mom was crying after hearing us screaming & he held her and using her as a shield ""Look at what you did! You need to stop!""

""NO, YOU ARE THE ONE WHO NEEDS TO STOP. Why do you do this to me?""

""Okay, fine! You win! You're smarter than me! You need to stop!"" as if trying to make it look like I was just being unreasonably petty about being wrong in a dumb argument.

""I'm not, I don't care about that or being right. All I care about is why you keep talking to me like this and why?""

""Fine, I'm sorry about being condescending, but you need to stop! Is that what you want to hear?"" - an expression of duper's delight flashed across his face as if he enjoyed provoking me.

""EXPLAIN WHY! You're can hate me, but why do you take your shit out on me? I don't take constantly take it out on others like you.""

He refused to explain- ""I'm sorry, that's just how I am! I'm sorry! I'm an asshole!""

My mom kept making excuses for him afterwards and I explained that it can't be that because he treats them, my parents, normally, but not me, it's like he has something against me.

My cousin is moping says he has to leave, as if I can never along with him, even though I only blew up on him JUST ONCE after a year & a half of this. I think asking for an explanation and asking for him to stop was reasonable, though the way I said it was extremely bad. All he could say was that ""he was an asshole"". I can't help, but think he'd rather me be a passive a punching bag, he'd rather leave, than simply stop being an asshole.

My father isn't optimistic about us getting along even though he knows how he is, he treats them the same way. Mor my mother. They blame me, but they won't say it so I can't even challenge it.

65,1e4ygpx,AITA for refusing to accept my once best friends apology?,"We were 15 at the time, and I had been friends with him since we were 11. I‚Äôll refer to him as H in this post. H and I had been really good friends since we were 11, but suddenly, for no apparent reason, he would start to constantly try to annoy me, make fun of me in front of my other friends, spread lies about me in front of my other friends and constantly try to cause arguments inside my friend group. I told him how I felt, and every time he would apologise and say he was sorry. But one time he took it too far. I had woken up to over 100 messages from two people I didn‚Äôt know, saying all kinds of things that I won‚Äôt say, but you can imagine what they were saying. I asked H if he had anything to do with this, he said he simply ‚Äútold them I had been talking about them‚Äù, which I hadn‚Äôt because I didn‚Äôt know they existed. I decided to ignore the messages and leave the group chat that H had added me two with the two people, and H tried to lie and say those two people ‚Äúforced him to make a group chat‚Äù. I obviously knew that was a lie right away because he had said he had told them I was talking about them. This happened again and again, and I told him this was the last time he would be treating me like this and stopped talking to him.

For the next month, H seemed to make it his mission to make me the most hated person. He would constantly spread lies about me to everyone we knew, including my friends, who some of them believed him and stopped talking to me for a while, until the ‚Äúmessages‚Äù he had sent everyone of ‚Äúwhat I have said‚Äù were proven to be fake/edited. That backfired on H pretty badly, and he started pretending to be friends with the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù people, who all hated him.

Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago, where I receive a message from a mutual friend of H saying he was very sorry to me, and he understands what he did wrong. I wasn‚Äôt buying it, and I turned out to be right, as last week I overheard him talking badly about me to another person. I hadn‚Äôt spoken to him in around a year, but I wasn‚Äôt surprised to find out that his apology was fake.

However some people think that I am TA because i refused to accept H‚Äôs apology when he has no friends, but i believe that the reason he has no friends is purely down to himself. From what ive seen, he wanted to become friends with the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù people and he didn‚Äôt want to be seen around the quiet kid like me, so he resorted to spreading lies about me, which simply backfired on him. Some people are calling me TA for refusing to forgive him.

My friend ‚ÄòAmy‚Äô (27F) is normally a very fun friend but recently I had been noticing that when she asks me to do something and I tell her I need to double check with my husband she gets annoyed. I admittedly never really used to do this but since I had a baby it makes more sense to do because if my husband was already making plans, it‚Äôs not like we can just do our own separate things anymore, we have a baby to think of and need to plan to find someone to babysit if we‚Äôll both be out. 

This past weekend I went to the movies with Amy and after it was ofer she suggested we go get dinner. This wasn‚Äôt originally the plan so I said ‚Äòyes sounds good, let me call husband really quick-‚Äò and before I could even finish my sentence she literally stomped off and shouted FORGET IT! I was literally so confused and she had drove me there so I then had to call my husband to come get me, and he had to wake up our baby to do so. 

The next day Amy texted me a bunch of lomg texts and basically said that it‚Äôs ‚Äôcreepy‚Äô that I have to ‚Äòlet my husband know my every move‚Äô and that it‚Äôs rude to her for me to do that because when we make plans together my husband isn‚Äôt invited so he doesn‚Äôt need to weigh in.

 Also for context Amy has only ever been in one exclusive relationship when we were in school, they broke up before graduation and never lived together. so maybe that‚Äôs part of it but she really seems to believe I‚Äôm being controlled and that I should just do my thing and not check in with my husband.

It is part of an HOA with only 12 houses over 1000 acres, so we don't get much in each others' way.  There is a ""common area"" that abuts my property and on it there is a ""pond"" that is fed via an irrigation headgate on a creek on my property and a cut that runs from it through my property.  I've come to discover this pond is a real pain.  One neighbor used to maintain it (without making a fuss) but he died.

So dealing with it fell to me, as the neighbor most affected by it.  And it's a pain.  People trespass to go fishing or having their dogs swim in it.  People from outside have come to ice-skate on it (totally not safe!).  It has silting problems.  The headgate needs to be dug out every spring, sometimes multiple times. The cut clogs up and has to be cleared.  Then a beaver took up residence and kept blocking the outflow culvert, causing a flood on neighboring farmer's land (he was rightly pissed and I got the brunt of it).  I was clearing out beaver blockages several days a week.  Nobody else in the HOA would help.  I did some research and discovered that the water right for the headgate belonged to \*me alone\* and not the association (whoops!), there was no easement for the irrigation cut and, cherry on the sundae, the pond is actually on my property and not common area.  Had a survey done just to be sure. I also discovered it wasn't really a ""pond"" -- it was a hole dug up to provide fill for our road and the original developer just routed irrigation into the hole and called it a ""pond"", but this explains why it is such a mess.

A landowner a mile away is now digging out a proper pond and he has to pay a ton to dispose of the fill (even though it is clean).  I asked if it would help if he could put some of the fill in our ""pond"" and he offered to pay for the privilege.  I have closed the headgate and started draining the pond.  Some members of the HOA have been yelling at me that they like the pond (just to look at as they drive out to the main road).  So I said, ok, if you like it, pay up $10K a year for someone to deal with the nonsense.  They refused, I said that in that case the pond is getting filled in and planted with native grass, using the money from taking the fill  They call me a selfish asshole.  Am I?

UPDATE: I already met with a beaver expert from Fish & Wildlife.  They would have given me a ""nuisance"" permit to trap,but I wanted to try an exclusion fence.  Nobody else wanted to pay for that.  Expert said that if we lower pond, beaver will probably just move back to the creek.  We do have fish in the pond, but it isn't deep enough to support overwintering, so the actual sustained fish population is in the creek.

71,1e4x1up,WIBTA for banning my roommate's friend from our apartment for erasing a whiteboard?,"Six months ago, I (M18) and a friend who I'll call Alice (F18) moved out of our parents' houses and got an apartment. Many of our friends also have rocky relationships with their parents, so we fully expected to have some people move in with us from time to time.

When we first moved in, I'd hung a whiteboard on the wall, to use for a calendar and shopping list. Immediately, friends and visitors started writing cute messages and doodles on the board. I really liked it, so I bought a second whiteboard for the calendar. Over the months, we ended up with dozens of people's ""\[person\] was here!"" messages and drawings, and the whiteboard meant a lot to me.

Adam (M17), one of Alice's friends, would come over fairly often. His relationship with his parents was pretty inconsistent, so we let him leave some of his stuff, in case he needed to sleep over, which he hadn't done in months.

One night, recently, Adam tried to turn something extremely minor into an argument, which he did often. I let it go, and moved onto what I'd actually walked out to ask him, which was whether he still needed his stuff, or if he'd just forgotten about it. He took this as me wanting it gone, and started interrogating me about my intent. Finally, I figured I'd ""let him win"", by just agreeing with him that I was, in fact, telling him to move his stuff out.

Last night, Adam and his boyfriend were over, and I talked with his boyfriend a bit, but I was busy in my room. I could hear Alice describing her fights with our former roommate Sonia (F17) to Adam. I'd always gotten along great with Sonia, and agreed with her more often in the arguments with Alice (though I tried to mediate them), so eventually I decided I'd go say they were being unfair. When I did, I immediately saw the whiteboard, and Adam had erased at least half of what was on it. I was visibly shocked when I saw it, and his explanation was, ""I took off everyone who's irrelevant.""

I asked him if Alice had said he could, and he said no. Some of what he erased was everything Sonia had drawn, and he even rewrote her ""We love Alice and \[my name\]"", the first thing written on the board, in his own handwriting.

I was stunned and furious. I would have kicked him out of the apartment right then, but it was Alice who had invited him over, and I also didn't want to kick out Adam's boyfriend when he'd done nothing wrong. I'm thinking about saying I want Adam banned from the apartment. I'm still in shock that he'd do something so disrespectful of other people's property (and other people, who calls someone else ""irrelevant"" and erases their artwork?), and I don't want him around our other stuff anymore since I don't trust him.

Am I the asshole?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-16,"WIBTA for banning my roommate's friend from our apartment for erasing a whiteboard? Six months ago, I (M18) and a friend who I'll call Alice (F18) moved out of our parents' houses and got an apartment. Many of our friends also have rocky relationships with their parents, so we fully expected to have some people move in with us from time to time.

When we first moved in, I'd hung a whiteboard on the wall, to use for a calendar and shopping list. Immediately, friends and visitors started writing cute messages and doodles on the board. I really liked it, so I bought a second whiteboard for the calendar. Over the months, we ended up with dozens of people's ""\[person\] was here!"" messages and drawings, and the whiteboard meant a lot to me.

Adam (M17), one of Alice's friends, would come over fairly often. His relationship with his parents was pretty inconsistent, so we let him leave some of his stuff, in case he needed to sleep over, which he hadn't done in months.

One night, recently, Adam tried to turn something extremely minor into an argument, which he did often. I let it go, and moved onto what I'd actually walked out to ask him, which was whether he still needed his stuff, or if he'd just forgotten about it. He took this as me wanting it gone, and started interrogating me about my intent.

For their wedding, they‚Äôre assigning all the bridesmaids and groomsmen jobs like filming everyone getting ready, being an usher, taking photos of the guests when all of them enter for the guest book and just other things in general to help the wedding run well.

Initially, I was going to be an usher and film my sister getting makeup done and her journey to the venue but her fiance was against me doing any sort of getting ready videos since it would be girls getting ready with my sister with the exception of my father as he‚Äôd be driving my sister to the venue. His reasoning was that even though there are lots of rooms in the house to get ready, the bridesmaids will probably want to help my sister into her dress and have her help them into theirs and they wouldn‚Äôt want me around while all that was going on. He also said since the men would be getting ready at my family home and the women were getting ready at his, he has the final say as it is ultimately his family‚Äôs house that they‚Äôll be getting ready in. My sister argued that she would send bridesmaids out and call me in for the things she wants me to film however to avoid any arguments and to keep future brother in-law happy, I said that I‚Äôll leave the getting ready and journey video to a different person (probably one of the girls).

76,1e4w5k6,AITA for not wanting to pay for my cousin's cinema ticket?,"Hi all.

So I had a situation a few months ago where myself and my twin sister (25f) invited our cousin (24m) to come with us to the cinema for 2 films (¬£20 each total) and he came to our family home beforehand for dinner.

All was well until we arrived to purchase our tickets, when our cousin began mentioned having forgot his wallet with his card at home and being low on money.

I flipped out at him in public about not bringing money (I suspected he knew he didn‚Äôt have money before hand, don't know that I articulated it that way though).

He had previously not paid me back for dinner at a buffet restaurant (around ¬£20), and I was afraid of it becoming an established pattern.

I had rather cheekily asked for the money later in a group chat (with twib‚Äôs bf) but as I expected my cousin didn‚Äôt reply, but I Iet it go.

I asked after the films when he could repay me, and he expressed that he was angry at me, stating that we were family, that he would do it for me, we have jobs, he doesn't etc.

I hadn't realised it at the time but I think he had been passive aggressive (saying ""that's interesting‚Äù, giving non-verbal cues I can't articulate).

I kinda felt like he was treating it as if I was obligated to pay for him because I was related to him which upset me as I would never have that expectation if the roles were reversed, and would only view it as generosity if he did.

¬†

Some additional points:

-cousin doesn't work formally

-cousin sometimes seems like he doesn't want to work and seems picky about what kind of work he is willing to do (see point below)

-cousin describes being made to work in his family's bouncy castle repair business as torture

-cousin though has no GCSEs, in part contributed to suffering from cancer as a young child (starting at about 3 years), disrupting his education for many years, having lasting effects on his educational attainment, and so suggested that he feels that he would struggle to get a job which I sympathise with.



Overall, what bothered me was:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† the lack of transparency ahead of time and feeling unconsidered from it

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† the feeling of inconsideration from him seeming to feel entitled to me paying for him because we're related.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† also, the fear of him having that expectation each time we go somewhere incase it adds up (although we don‚Äôt go consistently each week)

77,1e4w5g6,AITA for wanting her to change her entitled ways?,"I recently started dating a 31yo woman who seems to have only dated men who've spoiled her.

When we met, she told me that she didn't want to go on a ""drinks date"" (she was trying to tone down the drinking), and she wouldn't go for a coffee or a ""water"" date (lol). She said she preferred to go for lunch or dinner only - although not necessarily somewhere expensive - and even though I insisted I didn't take women out on dinner as a first date, she rejected my offer of any activity or non-alcoholic drink dates.

After a 3-week talking stage of a few video calls, phone calls, and texts on most days, we settled on going for afternoon tea as our first date (in week 4). Following the date, she intimated that although she liked my company, she wasn't a fan of the venue I chose. Now, it wasn't that she's posh or anything, she just wouldn't have chosen that place.

Surprisingly, we made it on 3 more dates. She had told me that she liked to be picked up on her dates (even though I don't have a car), so I offered to Uber to hers for these 3 dinner dates. Whenever I resisted doing dinners even a little, her rebuttal was that this was the treatment she was used to, and that she liked ""being courted"".

The 5th date is where things got interesting. I decided to flip things around a bit, and agreed to take her on yet another dinner date if only she'd venture down to my neighbourhood. In my mind, if she could come to me, instead of me always going to her, it would show that she was at least a little invested.

Firstly, she asked to reschedule the date from Saturday to Sunday - and then within an hour of the meeting time on Sunday sent me a message saying ""Just checked TFL \[and it will take an hour getting to your area\] so it will be the same on the way home. I wasn't mentally prepared for this I am not going to be coming"".

I didn't let that fly; I immediately called her up and let her know that that was rude of her to cancel (again) last minute via text. She apologised, saying she didn't mean to be rude.

And yes, she was aware she sounded like a brat. I was flabbergasted. The entitlement made me sick to my stomach. But are people entitled to this treatment because ""they're used to it""?

In the past, I have steered clear of women like this, but the reason I didn't do that this time is that this woman does have some good qualities: she works part-time for a charity, and wants to start her own one day. I am wondering whether there is a possibility that this woman can change, or whether it's a lost cause - or whether I'm the asshole for even wanting to change her, I don't know!",1.0,1.0074502229690552,1,1

80,1e4v6h5,AITA For Getting A Coach Fired?,"For background, I am in my school's colorguard and this past winter we had our first winter season. The summer prior we had gotten a new coach whom I wasn't too fond of at first. She would make us do a team ""chant"" where we would jump in a circle and the different classes (freshman, sophomore, etc) would jump in the circle and ""shake their booty"". I had voiced my uncomfortable feelings towards this and she simply said ""if you don't like it know, too bad you will eventually.""
This would turn out to be a contradiction in her beliefs as she believed that everyone's boundaries needed and deserved to be respected. 
Well, over the winter, about a week after we had gotten back from break, she had shared disturbing things with some of the team, myself included. She made up lies about the marching band directors and had us all believing that they were horrible people. Naturally, I had to release my stress somewhere and somehow so I told three people who I trusted wouldn't tell anyone, one of them being my ex best friend, who was still my friend at the time. She ended up telling people about it as well as the two other girls I asked. This eventually got out that I had said something to them and it sent my into a spiral that everyone was pissed at me. I had started getting disturbing thoughts and one day during choir I texted my mom when things were really bad. Fast forward, I was sent home and the superintendent called wanting to talk to me. I told him everything that was said by the coach which led to practice being cancelled and her eventual dismissal from coaching. 
After this, most of the team was extremely pissed off at me and would give me the dirtiest fucking looks imaginable if I barely glanced at them in the hallway, which only made my mental state worsen. One girl particularly had it out for me. 
Things eventually got better with some of the girls and I didn't feel the desire to die as much anymore. 
Now with the summer season having started again (which I decided not to participate in) there are new coaches. Apparently none of the ones who idolized the old coach liked them since they thought they needed to be bitchy like she was.

So, tomorow is going to be my mothers birthday dinner, we're going to be 14 in total, when I heard who would be attending I told her I would not be splitting the bill because 5 out of 14 are kids. 

Last time I was ambushed by this, and because of it, instead of paying 18‚Ç¨(by my calculations while deciding on what to eat/drink) I ended up paying 36‚Ç¨ double the amount. 

So this time when I told my mom I would be paying for my meal and not some random kids, she told me I'm TA, and to not make a scene she would pay the ""extra"". 

And because of it, I started feeling a little bad, because I dont want my mom to pay for my ""extra"".

So anyway, WIBTA if I refused to pay for the kids?

I say the kids are 'random' even though they are children of family members, but since I only see them like 2 times a year, thats random to me.

To be honest, I'm not very fond of my in-laws. Whenever I talk to my mother-in-law, she criticizes me for various things, like not having a driver's license or a ""proper"" job in our country. This criticism makes me feel humiliated, and I naturally avoid talking to her. In fact, she once humiliated me for working part-time in a restaurant while studying. These experiences have created resentment towards her. It‚Äôs like a typical MIL so I don‚Äôt adjust with these although I love my in-laws, I prefer to maintain a distance.

Recently, a disagreement arose between my husband and me. After he finished his nightly call with his family, he asked why I wasn't calling my in-laws during the day, as they allegedly love me. I responded that he doesn't always call my mom, so why should I call his family? My husband usually calls my mom during his week off, around noon, and sometimes I try to wake him up to speak with her on the phone. He calls my family about once a week, while speaking with his family every two days at night. I told him I won't talk to his family if he doesn't reciprocate the same effort.

With the temperature, my bedroom would consistently be at 80+ degrees according to the thermometer on my fan and it was boiling hot so I would open my window at night sometimes to help me sleep, I'm not sure if it's because of the way the window was facing but this would rarely make any temperature difference in my room unless the wind was blowing into my room, and never affected the temperature outside my closed door.

88,1e4uaxc,AITA for calling the council rather than trying to talk to my neighbour about using my driveway? ,"I‚Äôve (40F) lived here ~ 12 years with my 3 kids. We are quiet introverts who keep to ourselves.

10 years ago neighbour moved in with 5 kids. They insisted we cut down a large tree and pay half to replace a fence so they could get a pool. We did this. It cost us about 10K in - all our savings at a time where we had a new baby.  We did it to be good neighbours. 

After this they started to play loud music regularly (Spotify with ads! So cheap!). It‚Äôs so loud I hear it inside. When at its worst I can hear it in the opposite side of the house with windows and doors shut. I‚Äôve attempted to have conversations and asked her to turn it down, she just stared at me blankly and didn‚Äôt do it. They also have loud aircon unit makes our yard feel like an airport runway (cool if you are into that, I guess). I‚Äôve not made complaints to the council to try and keep the peace. 

Our back yard has pretty much gone unused since they moved in because it‚Äôs so unpleasant to be out there. 

One day I refused to drop everything to throw a ball back over the fence after her kids pounded on my door for 15 minutes straight while I was busy.  The response - put the stereo on the fence line and blast music that could be heard streets away for hours .  I called the police as it was now 8pm on a Tues night and some other neighbours had young babies. The police attended and it stopped. 

Confused, I decided an adult must not have been home; clearly it was teen boy problem solving! I went to have a chat and clear the air. 

Nope. It was her.  She doubled down to the point she told me the police said I would be fined for wasting police time if so called them again. 

Kids now have cars so they park on their verge, often accessed by driving across my driveway and some lawn. It was pissing me off but I couldn‚Äôt be bothered dealing with her.

Figuring it was fair game, I parked there a couple of times in the morning to let contractors in while I got ready for work. One weekend I parked there ~1hr to mow my lawn.  I heard someone mowing at their place so went to move the car. She was waiting for me, immediately raging and ranting about not having permission to park there,  park on your own verge‚Ä¶. I tried to discuss. She continued to rant. 

I moved my car.

She continues to use my driveway, making a point of parking there despite no-one else being home and it being the least convenient spot for her. I tried to make a point by putting my bin on my verge. Then two cars started parking there, driving around the bin, while I was standing in my yard. 

Last night I was sick of it and I reported it to the council to deal with.

I was on my lunch break heating up some food in the microwave when my dad (who also works from home) walks into the kitchen.

After I take my food out of the microwave, my dad puts his lunch in and walks over to the island counter I hadn‚Äôt touched while throwing my rice and chicken into the microwave.

It could have been Mom (56 F) or Younger Brother (21 M) when they made breakfast before going to work this morning though.‚Äù

And that I will never be his equal and thus should not treat him as such. He then stormed off without giving either of us the chance to try and talk about what happened to reach an understanding.

90,1e4tu1r,AITA for refusing to travel out of town with my parents for my half sister's graduation?,"My half sister (25f) is graduating from college in August. I (15m) don't want to go with my parents to her graduation. So I told my parents I refuse to go with them and they will need to bring me against my will. I know I'm only 15 so that'll be hard and they're my parents and all. But I would rather be grounded for a year than go where it's only going to end in a fight because dad and I aren't wanted there.

BG: My mom's first marriage ended when my half sister was 3, my parents met when she was 5. Half sister's dad had a huge issue with my dad and half sister getting along and from what I have seen, she was around 7 when things started to take a turn (based on pictures where before then she looked like she really liked my dad and afterward you could see any photos with the two of them she was glaring at him or avoiding him), which was just after my parents wedding. Essentially half sister's dad would start fights with my dad whenever dad went to support my half sister at anything and over time my half sister started getting mad at my dad for ""ruining everything"" or for ""making her dad angry"". I remember there were times we'd be somewhere and her dad would come over to us, even though we were on a different side of the room or space and he would intentionally pick a fight. He'd even say mean shit to me, called me a retarded runt and all that. But it was my dad he had so much hate for. He told dad his daughter didn't need some random guy showing up to support her and fuck him.

My half sister never failed to blame my dad. Even when she'd be there when her dad would start shit and come over to us, she'd still blame my dad. Her high school graduation ended with her dad getting arrested because of his reaction to my dad and she still blamed my dad.

I asked a few times why she blamed my dad and she told me because she wanted her dad there more than us, and she'd always pick her dad's side. She also said I didn't matter as much to her as her dad did when I asked why she wasn't mad at her dad for calling me mean things. She said my dad ruined everything by making her like him at the start.

To this day she's cold to me and my dad. She has told mom she wants her to still show up to things but not us. But my mom told her that was not something she was willing to do. Which has led to me not wanting to be where she'll be or her dad. And I especially don't want to leave town for her graduation.

I went to her house this morning to get them only to find out that she threw away several of my utensils away because they ‚Äúbroke‚Äù to be clear the heads on some of my utensils pop off to be washed in a dishwasher since the handles were wooden.

To summarize this I (28) have been with my partner for 3 years, some part of his family are kind of wealthy but not all of them. His cousin ‚ÄòMarie‚Äô (around 38F) is very lavish and arrogant. I‚Äôve never felt welcomed by her. My family wasn‚Äôt dirty poor but we definitely struggled growing up. I don‚Äôt deny my upbringing and while I‚Äôm not very defensive about it i try not to take things personally

Recently during a family reunion we were talking about how my SIL‚Äôs daughter ‚ÄòSasha‚Äô has developed an interest in thrifting. Both getting stuff from thrift shops and selling/donating things. My SIL and I were talking about how that‚Äôs such a nice hobby and nice thing to do. Sasha mentioned that her friend got a nice equality bag from a thrift shop, then Marie inserts herself in the conversation and says she owns the so called bag

Sasha says that her friend was lucky and got a very nice deal for it since she can‚Äôt actually afford it as she‚Äôs just a college student.

What kind of bag is it Sasha?‚Äù Sasha says the brand and I ask Marie ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your bag?‚Äù And she mentioned the same brand but gets defensive and adds ‚ÄúI bought a similar bag from the store and had to wait a lot for it.

This is why I think I‚Äôm the asshole, I know Marie isn‚Äôt that wealthy and they have been struggling financially, obviously she keeps that hidden and doesn‚Äôt speak about it.

My (24F) boyfriend (25M) have been together for 2 years now. We have been doing LDR and managed to close the distance this year‚Ä¶ or so I thought. He may need to go back to the country where he was studying because he failed a course, which is naturally nerve-wracking for anyone meant to graduate this year and start a full-time job. He submitted an appeal to his university on whether he can do a special assessment since he‚Äôs a final year student.

At the same time, we‚Äôve been having a hard time the last 3 months since he‚Äôs back in town. He‚Äôs been quite overwhelmed with other personal issues and in his words, ‚Äúlost himself a little‚Äù, and that affected how he treated me in the relationship in terms of not making time for us, using mean language, not opening up, etc. It took a lot of self-reflection and tears on both of our parts, but we finally managed to talk through things and promise to move forward because we love each other.

Back to today. We‚Äôre not sure when the result of the appeal will be out, as it can be anytime from 5-20 days, but tomorrow is the 20th day. He‚Äôs nervous but for the past 2 months, seems resigned to the fact that he has to go and has been making preparations for the move.

I, on the hand, have been optimistic from the start that his school will accept his appeal - as per their policy for graduating students - and have been reassuring him that I think everything will be fine.

He also said that I‚Äôm ‚Äúweak‚Äù for saying that I‚Äôm worried, but when I pointed out that he wasn‚Äôt always this prepared for whichever outcome just a few weeks back, it just snowballed into another argument.

This resulted in me receiving the silent treatment, not knowing what I had done, for almost a whole week.

This time around, everything was fine throughout the day, but when we were going to go to dinner, her demeanor changed. She wouldn't talk to me. She would give me cut eye every time I looked at her, she would stop talking/ignore me if i tried to contribute to a conversation, and when we walked into the desert restaurant, she looked me up and down with disgust. Resulting in me leaving, without telling anyone as she made me SO uncomfortable being there. So why was she doing this you ask.... at this point, but. the next day i message her apologizing if i did something to upset her.. well here it is.

Recently, we stayed in a cabin on her property (that she NEVER sleeps in) and our daughter had a minor blowout from her diaper on her sheets (she's 2). (when I say MINOR It was 2 dime sized spots) I balled the sheets up for the time being to take them home to clean them. BUT until I left i left the unsoiled portion of the sheets on the mattress (with the soiled part off of the mattress), she of course doesnt go up to this bed, so she didnt let us explain that to her....

My husband was watching our daughter in the cabin while i was busy working/playing with my team, and i guess, put her soiled diapers in the garbage in the cabin. I wasnt in the cabin all day, so this wasn't in the forefront of my mind. SO when I went to retrieve our stuff to leave, I forgot to grab the garbage. Apparently making the cabin smell.

There is an outdoor sink on the property, we use for doing dishes, and cleaning our hands after using the toilet. My husband cleaned our daughters feet in it. That was game over apparently. (this sink has seen raccoon shit and piss, mud, old food, hands after washroom use, and bird shit falling from the sky.

Since saturday she messaged me telling me the above issues, stating I significantly lack situational awareness.

So i asked if i could reitterate, and she said you would be out of line as i just stated a boundary. I am now blocked on messenger as well.

I get boundaries, I get mental health, I am going through it. I just don't get how my ""best friend"" gets to leave me in mental shambles, and she gets to treat my husband and I with such disrespect without just coming out and saying it in the moment so we can deal with it head on.

I get boundaries, I get mental health, I am going through it. I just don't get how my ""best friend"" gets to leave me in mental shambles, and she gets to treat my husband and I with such disrespect without just coming out and saying it in the moment so we can deal with it head on.

Am i the asshole for being so unbelievably mad about this situation?",1.0,1.0358587503433228,1,1
103,1e4rlip,AITAH for making plans and not being able to help my mom like she asked,"Long story short, my mom asked me and siblings several months ago to help her move to a new house they were building. She didn't have a closing date set since it was dependent on their house selling and so she asked us to hold the month to be able to help her.

Every month, my friends and I get together to do a group activity and celebrate any birthday's. Our goal has been to keep this going for the entire year and so far we have. Tbh, it's been something I've really enjoyed and look forward to. Otherwise, I don't get out much. I held off on agreeing to a time to meet with my friends to do this until we got a closing date set, but as we neared August with no set closing date, I made plans because everyone was waiting on me and their weekends were filling up. I chose the last weekend of the month since it felt like the safest bet. My brother actually had booked tickets that Saturday (would come back Sunday) as well since it was a holiday weekend. He'd asked repeatedly for what the moving date would be, but we still hadn't been given any idea of when she needed our help.

Well of course closing date was then set and of course it was the weekend that both my brother and I had made plans.  I still had every single intention of helping her move, so I said I could help that Friday (I was willing to take that day off), Sunday, or that Monday since it was holiday week and we're off work. I offered to come help multiple days and to even come right after my plans finished on that Saturday, but send my husband early that morning since he's the important one anyway. She didn't want to pay for the U-Haul for 2 days and said she wanted us all to be there to help her on one particular day so it could be done in one day. She didn't like the idea of us all coming on Monday either. Her response was to hang up on me and then sent a group text out do say she would do it herself.

104,1e4rj9t,AITA for Not Caring About My Aunt After Finding Out She Talked Behind My Back That I Hate My Sister During My Sister's Wedding Week?,"I used to be very close to my aunt but had many issues with her interference in our life because my mother holds her on such a high pedestal. Still, my aunt was like a second best friend to me, and I thought my sister's wedding would be fun with her around, especially with her coming early for wedding prep, or so I thought...

To kick off the celebrations, we first had a full-on girls' night with every woman on both sides. We needed a certain instrument for that night. My mother has emotional regulation issues; she gets irritated and goes straight to cursing (my therapist said she is a narcissist), and the wedding stress added to it. Both my mom and aunt asked if any of my friends had that instrument. I said no, then they told me to ask the nail tech we would see the next day. Since my mom was unsure if she would get her nails done, I assumed she would go get it since the rest of us had nail appointments. Something about that pissed her off, and she started cursing, accusing me of not following through on commitments (which I admit happens sometimes, but not here) and then crying. My aunt walked in and asked what was wrong. My mom said I wouldn‚Äôt do it, and that set off my aunt.

My aunt, who was arranging everything for the day, started saying, ""I'm arranging everything, spending money, doing this for YOUR friends (3 friends), YOU wanted this function, and your father is arranging the food."" This set me off. Wanting things for my sister's wedding apparently meant I was entitled to do the work. I had already excused myself from being involved in anything since I had exams, but my aunt rejected my arrangement ideas and went ahead with extravagant plans. I said, ""You're not doing this for my friends or me; you are doing it for my sister."" The shouting escalated. Eventually, our house help had the instrument.

In the following days, my aunt was extremely passive-aggressive and wouldn't speak to me. She insulted me in front of my paternal aunt for saying I provided the reference pictures for the event (she wanted the credit), even when my sister agreed with me, and my mom was ganging up on me. What really hurt was when my mom said my aunt told her I talked badly about my sister for hours on the phone (implying my aunt was more valuable to my sister than me). The ""shit talk"" was simply me expressing my concerns about my sister about her choices of not being emancipated and wanting to be a housewife without any career, which she already knew. Throughout the wedding week, my aunt complimented my sister while degrading me. I spent the whole time crying and isolated in my room because she was staying with us. I honestly hate her at this point and am greatly disappointed by my mom.

We haven't talked since, and she doesn't know I know what she said behind my back. Everyone in the house agrees with how I feel, except for my mom.

105,1e4rj02,WIBTA if I slowly stopped talking to a guy.,"I (21F) recently started talking to a guy (24M) we first started talking on a dating app before moving onto something else. We hit it off immediately he is kind, nice, sweet and knows how to keep a conversation going, we have a lot of things in common and things are starting to go really well. We live in the same country just different states (if that make sense) but apparently he will be in my state next month and wants to meet.

I have no problem meeting the guy he seems nice and all but he talks about sex a lot like the conversation has probably gone back to sex like 4 or 5 times now. He has told me he's had sex with his Ex before (when they were dating) which is fine with me but I've never had sex so I can't really tell if he's bringing up because he wants to have sex with me or if he's just wanting something to bring up. Not only that he kinda brings up his ex a lot I don't want to be mean because sometimes hes ranting about her and shit she had done but still I don't know if he's just looking for a rebound or if he's looking for something new? And I don't have really any friends to talk to this about (most of them have there own lives they are living) 

So WIBTA if I just slowly stopped talking to him for my own comfort? We have been talking everyday and most of the conversation he has stated how we will meet and he will get a hotel and I'm too nervous to say no because he's a nice guy. But I need some advice on what to do like should I be worried? Or am I just over thinking the whole thing. 

Also note I have spoken to him about this and understood my concerns and worries then but now he has brushed it off and  brought up the same topic again about sex and meeting. 

(Note: I have been in a relationship before it's just me and my ex never got into sex we were in high school when we were dating and weren't really comfortable doing that) 

(Little update (not really one) I'm very thankful of all the advice and people pointing out the red flags that I very much over looked I was just happy that I met a guy who wasn't weird. Might not respond to everyone but I'm very appreciated on the advice and feedback so thanks üôÇ)

The rule in our household is that if you want fast food when we are out you pay for it with your own money. If you don't have McDonald's money you aren't going there. I also don't allow eating in the car, so we stop at places to eat.

We had to go out and do some errands. I told her to grab something to eat before hand but she said she wasn't hungry. We go on our errands and halfway through she wants to stop by Wendy's. I pull in and tell her to go order I will get a seat.

She comes back a few minutes later and tells me she can't order. She doesn't want to talk to the cashier at the front of the store. I told her she needs to order and we will head out. She asked me to order and I told her no. We sit for about 10 minutes when I tell her it's time to go.

She in short is pissed and my wife is also upset I didn't order for her. That I let her go hungry ( I find this stupid I didn't starve her for days it was 4 hour outing)

Edit: for those asking yes, her counslor has told us she she needs to start doing this stuff on her own, this was low risk. She literally gave the example of ordering food without our help.

I also ran through a script with her at the table but she wouldn't do it

109,1e4r1j3,WIBTA for calling out my boyfriend for being TOO honest?,"My boyfriend (18M) and I (18M) have been together for a while now and the only person from his close family I haven‚Äôt met is his grandma. I had planned to get the train to his Grandmas city with him today to go meet her, he was going to visit anyway and I was asked if I could come with this time a couple weeks ago and I agreed and was excited to meet her.

Fast forward to this morning, I am trying to get ready but I feel awful, I woke up upset and had spent all morning trying to gain the motivation to even get up. For context I struggle with depression and I‚Äôm also autistic. The last few days I‚Äôve been incredibly burnt out and that‚Äôs even had an affect on my relationship as I‚Äôve been struggling to even maintain usual conversation with my boyfriend because of how drained I‚Äôve been (Because of SO much socialising lately). Despite this, I was still very much willing to go today as I knew my boyfriend was excited for it, as was I.

This morning my boyfriend called me whilst getting ready and I completely shut down, I went non-verbal due to the stress of socialising and I ended up hanging up and texting him to explain the situation, I told him I wanted to go more than anything but it wasn‚Äôt fair on anyone for me to be anti-social the whole time and likely non-verbal and make his grandma uncomfortable.
I told him to pass on my apologises and obviously apologised to him too.

An hour later I get a text from my boyfriend telling me that his grandma is angry with me?? He told me that his grandma was angry and that she doesn‚Äôt want me to eat at her house in the future? (I guess grandma punishment lol)

I asked what he had told his grandma and he explained that he had said that I was too drained and needed to recharge.

This is where I got upset, not only did I definitely not need to hear all about what his grandma had angrily said about me. But also, I understand I did not ask him to lie about why I had cancelled so abruptly, but who‚Äôs grandma is going to understand and respect someone cancelling because of their mental health? I don‚Äôt understand why he didn‚Äôt say I was Ill or had a family emergency but it is what it is.

I‚Äôve been completely civil with him and haven‚Äôt said anything about the issue. I kinda expect to be called an AH here, but also is it crazy to not want to know what his grandma has angrily said about me?

Basically what happened is we went to this theme park and got fast entry passes onto rides which we could use over and over again for the entire day.

Whilst waiting in line, which we hadn't waited long maybe 10 minutes tops. The ride had some sort of technical error and the ride operators went over the intercom saying the ride has stopped operating temporarily and technicians were on the way.

We waited in line for maybe 20 to 30 mins. The technicians had come and were doing tester rides (just sending rides off empty). At one point one of these testers got stuck on the track and just stopped moving.

At this point I completely freaked out. I was anxious about being the first people to go on the ride after those test rides but the ride stopping mid test just scared the hell out of me.

There is a large tournament coming up, and I am already qualified. We went to a smaller qualification tournament this past weekend. There is another friend of mine Brad, that my other friend Dan doesn't like to travel or go places with. Dan thinks Brad is a great guy, but to be fair, Brad is a mooch and has no social awareness.

Myself and another friend Kev were going to ride with Dan to this smaller tournament. Dan told me to make sure I don't ""loan out his car"" to anyone else. Another friend asked if I was able to take Brad to the tournament (Brad has a reliable car, but to the earlier point, is kind of a mooch, which is why Dan never wants to take them/travel with them). I replied ""it's not up to me"" in the group chat. Dan took this as me telling Brad I was going with Dan and proceeded to yell and cuss at me over the phone. My wife overheard the conversation and was concerned that Dan was talking to me that way (not on speaker btw) and I was pretty mad.

I offered to take Brad to the tournament. Dan later apologized to me, and told me why he doesn't like to travel with Brad (earlier info) and said that he just doesn't understand why I would continue to be nice like that, but whatever.  
FF to Saturday, Brad and I go to the tournament and the turnout is small. These things won't even fire with less than 8 people, we had 10 total. Other friend Kev and I were considering sitting out so that we would save \~ 4 hours of time, but given yesterday's events and the fact I just committed to driving 3 hours, I wanted to play (this is where me being petty comes in). Dan mentions to me that I should just sit out and save the time (purpose of the trip is to get Dan qualified). Even if Kev and I don't sit out, we can still drop at anytime during the tournament and Dan still has good shot. I apologized to the group of 9 other players, stated my reasoning, and we start. Dan loses the first round and promptly leaves and goes back home and is irate the rest of the day.

Both to myself and to Kev, Dan sends messages stating how messed up it was and how I am a terrible friend who is really spiteful but wear a nice mask. Dan tells me how he can't trust me and if anything like that ever happens again being nice won't get me out of it. Dan now doesn't want to go to the larger tournament with us even though it is 5 of us that are all good friends. I apologized, and told Dan I would do whatever I need to to make it up to them because I feel like it was the wrong move.

I was later treated for both depression and my eating disorder and went to therapy. 

Fun fact: my depression meds make me gain weight. I‚Äôve gained over almost 40 pounds (18kg roughly) over the course of my college years. Now I think because I‚Äôm at home I‚Äôm back looking in the mirror and get depressed I can‚Äôt fit into old clothing anymore. I am not exactly obese but overweight and plump, and anyone who says I‚Äôm not is lying. My therapist said I might have body dysmorphia but I can try diets and do things to feel better but not binge or vomit or starve myself and I agree to try it.

I cannot stress how much one of my friend circles love cancel culture btw, they shamed me for saying jokes even about my own race (I‚Äôm Asian) and I feel more distant from them now that their life is all about basically cancelling ppl for the smallest things, even kpop idols/groups I like. It‚Äôs stressful to be with them. 

There‚Äôs two girls who I ate with the other day, I‚Äôll call them Jane and Doe. I was a bit stressed because all the girls on streets were pretty in skirts or shorts and had nice legs since it‚Äôs hot recently and got a bit sad. So I‚Äôm eating with Jane and Doe and they ask why my order is so little and I reply I‚Äôm on a diet because I‚Äôm fat. 

They get insanely angry at me, and then continue to say how I have fat people hate and I‚Äôm shaming our two other friends (A and B) who are obviously bigger than me. I don‚Äôt think I ever implied that, in my eyes I‚Äôm fat and prefer to diet, but my other friends who don‚Äôt struggle with body dysmorphia are free to live as they want. 

When I see a fat person I don‚Äôt even think ‚Äúthey should diet‚Äù, in fact it hardly stays in my mind. I made my comment (I‚Äôm fat) without even registering A or B. In the end we kind of parted badly but then I heard from A that Jane and Doe told them how I called myself fat and if im fat what is she? I apologized and said I didn‚Äôt mean it that way and think personally it‚Äôs shitty of Jane and Doe to privately message their own version of what happened.

113,1e4qcoc,AITA for not telling my mom where I stayed last night?,"Hi guys, this is going to be a slight rant, as this story does need some context when it comes to my family life. 

I still live with my mom at 21, and she has really cared to make sure I am comfortable as I finish up schooling. However, there are often times where I feel like her love and care can be overbearing and controlling. My mom needs to know exactly where I am, at what time, all the time. Doesn't matter if it's work, school, or even lunch with a friend -- she needs to know. 

This behavior has existed in our dynamic ever since I was young. For example, I remember how my mom would require me to ask at least a week in advance to even hang out with friends, even as an older teenager. I remember getting punished for small things that even tempted me into being a ""bad"" child or could possibly ""ruin"" my future. Mind you, we aren't talking about drugs or alcohol, we're talking about writing fanfiction and otome games. 

This kind of behavior carried over to my adulthood. Instead of punishing me, my mom will often guilt me into giving up a thought or a passion she doesn't agree with. These exchanges often go like,

""You don't care about my feelings because you decided to do ____""

This concept of hurting my mom lingers in my mind everytime I decide to do something. Should I hang out with my uni friends after class? No, my mom would get too worried about me because she doesn't like me coming home when it's dark. 

Even when we have discussed how her behavior makes me feel trapped, and how it makes me feel like she doesn't trust me to make good decisions, she will dismiss it. She only says ""you make me worry and you're not respecting my feelings.""

This brings me to my story. I've started dating again, and last week, I went on a date with someone ive been seeing for a while. That day I texted her saying that I was out with someone and that I didn't know when I was going to be home. 

I had gotten a little high and didn't feel comfortable driving home that night. He let me stay at his place and I got a text in the middle of the night from my mom saying ""oh so I see that when you don't know when you're going to be home means you're not, good to know."" 

After that text, she didn't talk to me for 3 days straight. 

Because of that, I decided to just not tell her this time. not only did this make her mad, but she texted that I don't give a fuck about her feelings or that I'm likely dead. Mind you, I was gone from the house for UNDER 24 hours and I came home early this morning. 

Am I the asshole here? I feel like everytime I try to talk about her behavior, she shuts me down and justifies her behavior because she's my mother and needs to care about me. While I appreciate her love and I admire her a lot, I really despise how I can't win no matter if I do what she says. 

Edit: Wow, I wasn't expecting this to gain any traction. I did want to clarify how my mother has acted in the past with these things. I've absolutely tried telling her when I'm not going to be home in the past, but often, I'm met the next day with passive-aggressive comments from her. I remember taking a nap after being out late one night recently, and she woke me up saying ""oh you tired from being out all night?"" Idk why, but she has this passive-aggressive attitude whenever I go out at night. 

Also, moving out is not really an option for me. As much as I appreciate the suggestion, I don't have a well paying job and I pay for everything else that isn't food and housing.

114,1e4q9kt,AITAH (32m) for having female friends?! My girlfriend (30f) is convinced I am ,"I've been with my girlfriend for 9 months and it's been great. We met through social media/common interests, she's really supportive, understanding and she brings out the best in me. But lately we've been having problems over me having a number of female friends.

When we first got together, I told her that I don't see men or women any different and I treat them both the same in friendships. She was ok with it. She said she thinks that when it's serious that partners should be introduced to friends, especially when it's the opposite sex. I agreed with her but I don't really feel the same or see why. People are allowed to keep their friends separate. 

Anyway, she was totally cool with my female friends. I would meet for coffee, work out with them etc. 

Until I went out with a few people for a friends (female) birthday, my phone died and I didn't contact her until 11am the next day. I told her straight away that I stayed at the same hotel as this girl but not the same room which is true. Everybody else had gone home. 

She was ok at first but now she's got a problem with me having female friends at all. She found out that I was only meeting that girl in person for the first time but we've been friends online for like two years. 

A few weeks ago, I told her I was going for coffee with another girl mate (I've known her almost a year and we've met in person about 10 times). She wasnt thrilled but said it was fine. I ended up going to a bar with my friend and we had a couple of drinks so I was with her about 6 hours. My friend dropped into conversation that she was attracted to me (she knows I have a girlfriend). So I wrapped up the meet up and walked with her to her train. After she left, I told her the friendship was over because it's unfair to my girl. 

I then call my girl to tell her and she got really upset and accused me of leading people on by going out on 'dates' with them and said this was all my fault. I'm baffled. I did the right thing and this is her reaction. 

Now a couple of weeks later, she is saying that she doesn't want to be with me if I keep hanging out one on one with my girl mates, that I must be giving the wrong signals and that I've embarrassed her by staying overnight with women and spending time in close proximity to them and what did I think was going to happen.

She's adamant that she's going to leave me if I ever meet a woman alone again.

We used to hang out more when we were younger (7-10 years old), but even then, I never felt a strong connection with him. We don‚Äôt have much in common, and his personality often ticks me off. Our hangouts are usually during family vacations or special occasions with our parents.

Here are a few of my ‚Äúicks‚Äù about him (I don‚Äôt point these out to him or make fun of him, I just keep them to myself):

1. **Bad personal hygiene:**
   - He once stayed at my condo and picked at his feet on my bed, even after I walked in.
   - During a vacation, he didn‚Äôt shower or brush his teeth after a long, sweaty day.

2. **Lack of self-image awareness:**
   - He doesn‚Äôt shave his patchy beard, which looks untidy.
   - His fashion sense is odd. He wears tight-fitting clothes that don‚Äôt suit his body type and only wears skinny jeans. I‚Äôve tried giving him advice, but he doesn‚Äôt take it well.

3. **Narcissistic tendencies:**
   - He‚Äôs competitive about English, even though it‚Äôs not our first language. I excelled in English during school, but he constantly tries to compete with me on pronunciation and grammar.
   - He embarrasses me by trying to mimic slang or show off his English skills poorly.

Now, our mom plans to take us on a trip to Japan, and we each have to pay $2000 for plane tickets. I‚Äôve always wanted to visit Japan, but I don‚Äôt want to ruin my experience by going with my stepbrother. AITA for refusing to go?

About a month ago, I had just moved into a new building and I had many boxes, broken down, bound together within one taller, more narrow box in which the other boxes stood. I put this out for recycling and was met with a note near the mailboxes that said ‚Äúcan we not put boxes that aren‚Äôt tied up in the recycling area?‚Äù OK- understood! Although my boxes were ‚Äútied up,‚Äù one might say, within another box, this apparently did not meet the protocol. Though I‚Äôve seen boxes put out this way before plenty. I still accepted that I was doing something wrong in this instance and moved about my day. Didn‚Äôt do that again.

Fast forward- I have yet again a bundle of boxes ready to go down to recycling- tied up the right way this time. My elderly cat happened to puke on the pile of boxes (LOL just my luck) so instead of recycling them, I actually decided to set them out for bulk pickup which was coming that night. Again, I am met with a note, on the stack of boxes which were brought inside this time, that said, ‚ÄúTo whoever put these out with the trash this morning, please read the rules on recycling in this building.‚Äù Unsure what to do now LOL

My husband is currently struggling with MS and waiting on treatment.  Since I moved out here with him as it was his idea, none of my family members have made an effort to come here as it is too ""far"" yet my father will travel 10 hours to see our other sister in a different country. 

I understand my sister as she is pregnant and there are limitations for flying, but we've been living out here for 3 years.  No one calls to check on how we are doing, no one even tries to plan a visit they just want me to move back home so we can save while my husband gets treatment and we can get another house.  

We got into a fight that my and she told me not to come to her baby shower.  I immediately canceled the flight tickets that her and my father agreed they were helping me out with and I basically wasted 430$ round trip to go there.  I never once saw the money they offered to help with.  So AITA for not going to her baby shower?  She has looked to me for support the entire pregnancy and yet no one has seen how we are doing.  The fight happened because of my father treating me and talking to me like a child and cutting me off and not listening when he brought up the subject and because I disagreed he talked over me saying he didn't want a hear it and that's how it turned into me and my sister fighting.  So AITA?  

UPDATE:

So the reason why I'm asking if I'm the asshole since some people are asking, is because I feel guilty for canceling the flight tickets on a emotional response rather than thinking it through first.

121,1e4ogl0,AITA if I want my GF to go home,"AITA for wanting my GF to go home. I will start this by saying we‚Äôve been together for a year. It‚Äôs been a tough year for both of us. Recently her grandfather died. She has been in my house for 3 weeks prior to that. I knew I shouldn‚Äôt have asked her to leave, so I told her she can stay and I can be your comfort. Not a problem at all. It‚Äôs been 3 weeks since he died, so she has stayed at mine a total of 6 weeks now. We don‚Äôt live together, and I‚Äôve told her I‚Äôm not ready for that yet, but we are working up to it. 
I lived with roommates since I moved out by myself last year. She‚Äôs been struggling a lot mentally, and she has to do practically a full week of school. 830-4 everyday for a week. She‚Äôs going through a lot, and she tells me it‚Äôs better for her mental to be with me. Me on the other hand, I also have been going through it, I lost my favorite knife, which was my late mother‚Äôs favorite knife and have been struggling since that. My rental property burned down and I‚Äôve been struggling financially since I have to pay for that, and all of my mental health problems on top of that. Lately, she‚Äôs been asking for more and more help, in which I try to help. I‚Äôm trying to be there for her, but I feel unappreciated lately. I feel I‚Äôve been doing tons for her, and she‚Äôs been really not herself (good way of putting it). It‚Äôs driving me insane. To the point of I don‚Äôt want to be with her anymore. Everything I do is wrong, any decision I make is questioned, everything I say is a problem. We fight and argue about stupid things, that shouldn‚Äôt even be existing. All she says is sorry, and moves on. I can‚Äôt lie and say it‚Äôs all her, but it is me too. 
This has been taking a toll on me, and I would like her to go to her parents house/where she lives so that I can reset myself. I know she doesn‚Äôt have the best relationship with her dad, and she has a lot of bad history there, but I need this. I heal, work and reset myself way better by myself. It was hard to do this with roommates, so that is why I decided to live on my own and put more money up in rent. I feel trapped, overwhelmed and cramped in my own home. Anytime I bring it up that she should go home, she starts to cry and always says this week doesn‚Äôt work, we have plans. But I feel she likes to make plans week in advance for this exact reason. I need a week, the weekend and she can come back, but it seems like it‚Äôs a problem for her.

122,1e4ofgs,AITA for not naming my friends - who are friends of a diagnosed psychopath - as my children's godparents?,"Background: \[English isn‚Äôt my first language so sorry about possible weird phrases.\] We are a small but close-knit group of six friends who have known each other since middle school and are now in our thirties.

Two years ago, I fell ill suddenly and seriously, went into ICU and almost died. When my condition improved, I was transferred to another ward, where I heard that my first-born son (and then our only child) had also become seriously ill. My husband had tried to get to the emergency room with him, but they were not taken seriously. I left the hospital (still seriously ill) so that we could take our child to the emergency room together. This time we were taken seriously, but the treatment came too late and our son died in the hospital. Naturally, we were devastated. I told all this to my friends, and one of them (let's say Anna) said that she couldn't be bothered with us anymore because our topics of conversation were too tiresome. The others made no comment to this.

I am a mental health professional and few years ago Anna told me in confidence that she is in fact a psychopath and feels none of the emotions she expresses outwardly, and that in reality she doesn't care about other people. She is an extremely well-liked and charming person with a wide circle of friends. None of them know what Anna really thinks of them, because I have never said anything about our conversation.

I don't mind losing Anna as a friend per se, but the way she expressed it and the time she chose to do it offended me. Apart from Anna, I cannot understand friends B and C (let's say Bonnie and Connor), who are still actively involved with her, partying together, etc. I don't think a person who abandons you at the worst possible moment is a friend. Therefore I don't understand how others can still be with her as if nothing has happened. I'm starting to feel resentment for my other friends because of this. My friends think I'm overreacting. Mind you, they do not know she‚Äôs a diagnosed psychopath, so that‚Äôs no ‚Äôexcuse‚Äô. So in their mind it‚Äôs just normal to act like she did? To just not care about someone‚Äôs loss and tell them to ‚Äôstop being such a drag‚Äô and leave?

My husband and I recently had another son, and were thinking who can we name godparents for him. These are my only friends and therefore my only options for godparents. Anna, Bonnie and Connor now live in the same city near each other and socialise a lot. Bonnie is my best friend and was my first choice for godparent and I love her, but I don't want my child to ever have anything to do with Anna, so I've started to think about not naming Bonnie and Connor as godparents, because for us being a godparent means that you spend a lot of time with the godchild even without his parents when the child is older, so the odds are that our son would be meeting Anna also.

There‚Äôs also friends David and Elsa, but they‚Äôre both voluntarily childless and do not want to be godparents either, this is fine by me. But Bonnie and Connor think I‚Äôm being an asshole for re-thinking this godparent thing.

So I try to do stuff in the household, I suggest to cook, most of the time she declines as she doesn‚Äôt trust my cooking skills.

I always state she shouldn‚Äôt do it, she replies something along the lines with ‚Äúif I won‚Äôt do it, nobody will‚Äù.

She never has time for herself, at least doesn‚Äôt make time for herself, it‚Äòs either Work, Chores or Instagram/Youtube.

I was older when I met Amy. Her mom didn't want us raised together or to know each other. Dad didn't fight to have custody of us the same week.

When I was 5 my maternal grandma was diagnosed with alzheimer's disease and my mom took care of her. But it took a toll on my mom's health and when I was 7 my mom died and my grandma died a year later when I was 8. It was after my mom died I met Amy for the first time. And we've had a difficult relationship since.

Amy wants to be my sister sometimes and hates me other times. She'll try to be close to me, say we're real sisters and wants to spend time with me. She'll go out of her way to get close to me. Then she's cruel. Saying she's glad my mom and grandma are dead, saying I should get over them, telling me her mom is better than mine and I should l try and get her (she says our) parents back together so we can be a family. She's stolen my stuff to break them and then accused me of doing it to get her into trouble. She has tore up photos of my mom and grandma. She has said I'm ugly just like my mom. She told me to go die several times.

To add to the whole fucked up shit. Her mom hates me and still hates that her daughter knows me. And my dad is still in love with my mom and has a lot of wedding photos and photos from when they were dating in the house, which Amy hates me for, and is jealous of. He'll talk about mom being the love of his life to us too.

And the truth is I don't love Amy and I wish her mom had got her way and we were never in each other's lives. She adds nothing good to mine.

Onto what happened. So I struggle with missing my mom and grandma. I miss them. I'm still dealing with some grief in therapy. And I found a game called Spiritfarer which deals with grief and there's some characters that are really personal for me. I started playing it a few weeks ago, for a couple of hours a week, as part of therapy. Amy has seen me playing it and she told me she wanted us to experience it together and I said no. She told me sisters are there for each other. I told her I would never share my grief with her of all people and I wanted her to go away and leave me alone. Amy got upset and started to cry and I went back to my game and ignored her. Dad found her crying when he got home and after talking to her he told me he was disappointed I didn't comfort or reassure her. Amy told me I'm a bad sister and I act like I don't even want her in my life. I didn't say anything to her.

126,1e4o4qp,AITA for talking to my sister about my engagement plans during her engagement period,"I(21f) am MOH to my sister's(22f) wedding, and I'm really happy for the couple. My sister and her fiance(29m) were together for about a year before getting engaged. They've been engaged for about four months now, but they plan on having a long engagement period. Their wedding is going to be a destination wedding, early 2026. My family loves her fianc√© and we're all really excited about the wedding.

My boyfriend and I have been together for about 5 years, we are high school sweethearts. About a month or two ago my boyfriend and I were talking about the future and he said we could start ring shopping in a year. As he is almost done with school and has said we could get married afterward. I had told my sister and mom about this and my sister had said that if my boyfriend really wanted to propose, he could ""beg"" to do it at the destination of her wedding but after the ceremony (we will be there for about a week). Well my mom told my boyfriend, and he had said he probably wouldn't wait that long and he could afford to buy the ring now if he wanted.

I told my sister what he had said, and she ""jokingly"" said that he better not. As she didn't want my engagement to undermine her engagement era, and that it also would put too much stress on our mom. I told her that he still wouldn't propose for another year or so, and we wouldn't get married until a year after her wedding, as to give time to the family to save. Since I too want a destination wedding and have continually told my family for years that I want one. Not that they would be paying for the wedding, just their flights and stay at the resort.

My sister didn't seem too happy about me talking about it, and I really didn't want to upset her. I really thought she'd be happy about the news, especially since she's technically going to be ""officially"" married early 2025 (she doesn't want to pay more for a marriage license in another country), but her wedding ceremony won't happen until a year after that.

I have heard many times of siblings being engaged around the same time, and thought that since me and my boyfriend have been together for a while now that it wouldn't be strange to talk about getting married in the future(3+ years away). My sister's fianc√© and his brothers have all been engaged around the same time and have been getting married a year after each other.

I by no means want to ""steal her thunder"" by getting engaged during her engagement. Just didn't expect her reaction of unhappiness toward me getting engaged.

She later said I could take the car and she would rent a car daily which is prohibitively expensive.

My (42F) brother (39M) has a live in housekeeper, Vivian. I believe the girl is 18 or 19. In our country and particularly our city, housekeepers are in very high demand, especially ones from the same region of our country as Vivian is because they have the best food in the country.

My brother got divorced a year ago and got very depressed, so I advised him to hire a housekeeper to help him maintain his daily tasks. She also helps him by babysitting his two daughters when it is his custody time when he is at work. 

I went grocery shopping a few weeks ago with my brother and he picked up a box of chocolates and some flowers for Vivian. He told me that she was sick and I thought it was very sweet of him. 

However, my nieces (my brothers daughters) told me that their father always hits on Vivian when she is working and he buys her expensive gifts. Then yesterday, he made an off handed comment about her body when she was bringing some foot to the table when I went to his home to have lunch with him. She laughed awkwardly and excused herself.

I asked him what he was doing and basically, he is attracted to her. I told him that his behaviour with her was not appropriate as he is her employer and if he cannot behave, he should let her go. When he hired her, her agency said that there were many other families who wanted her because of resume so she will not be left jobless. I told him that she deserves to have a work place that is safe.

136,1e4ltny,AITA for not supporting my sister‚Äôs unusual relationship?,"My (18) older sister (20) has always been a bit naive in my opinion. She's not stupid by any means but she'd often fall for scams and struggle to grasp simple concepts, I believe it's because we grew up in a rather isolated environment. Due to work, my sister has been living away from home for a while, and has recently broken up with her boyfriend (19) of 2+ years. This didn't really surprise anyone since she had been saying that she wasn't in love with him that much anymore. But apparently that wasn't the reason she broke up with him. Instead, she told me that she'd fallen in love with someone at her workplace. She hesitated, but eventually revealed he is almost 60 years old. I didn't take it well. As I already mentioned, she can be naive, and I was certain she was being taken advantage of. I told her my opinion, that I think it's weird, and she got really upset at me. She accused me of being unsupportive and trying to sabotage her relationship, that she has more experience than me anyway, that it's just seen as weird by society whilst it's not, that she knows what she's doing, and other stuff I don't remember. This conversation happened more than a month ago and I didn't see her often after that. I tried to forget about it, but yesterday she brought her boyfriend home. I was at work so I didn't really have to talk to him, but at some point I did meet him, I tried to act normal but to me it‚Äôs just way too weird. I couldn't really look him in the eyes and I avoided them both because this whole situation makes me incredibly uncomfortable. Today they left, and my mom asked me, in a rhetorical manner, why everyone judges my sister‚Äôs boyfriend ‚Äòjust because he's old'. I told her that it's unusual, that an almost 60 yo has hardly anything in common with a 20 yo, which resulted in a discussion. My mom told me that she's also with someone that is almost 60, but I said it's not the same since they are much closer in age, and it's generally a red flag if someone seeks a relationship with a person that has 40 years less of life experience. My mother told me I'm discriminating against my sister's boyfriend and I shouldn‚Äôt judge, also it's none of my business, so I told her I want nothing to do with this situation, I am entitled to my opinion and I think it's weird that she doesn't see what's wrong, which upset her. I asked her if she think the same if my sister was 15, and she said 'yes, because she can do what she wants'. This whole situation makes me uncomfortable but I just feel it's wrong, even if my sister's boyfriend has no ill intentions. I generally don't care much about age difference but in my opinion 40 years is a lot and I'm also worried that my sister didn't think this quite through.

I came up to get some breakfast and my sister noticed the stain. She mentioned it and I just kind of shrugged it off, but my mom was appalled. She started going in saying that it was gross, ordering me to throw them away, and that people on Skid Row wouldn‚Äôt even wear pants like that.

All I asked for was just ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean it that way, but I‚Äôm sorry if I hurt your feelings.‚Äù Instead I got told that I was being completely unreasonable, that I have too many feelings, and that I must just think and tell everyone that she‚Äôs a terrible mother.

139,1e4lfo0,AITA for asking my flatmates GF to not shower or put the dishwasher on?,"My flatmate (25m) has been dating this really nice woman for almost a year now, I have no problem when she hangs around or covers our entire lounge in sheets so she can paint. Shes a really nice person and we often talk about work since we are both in the social services field. 

As far as I'm aware she still has her own flat and doesn't technically live here but she spends pretty much 24/7 here and a few things are starting to get annoying. 

Firstly since its winter she often leaves the heat pump on in the lounge and personally since I spend most of my time in my room I never turn it on. There have been countless occasions that I've come home to an empty house with all the inside doors open and the heat pump still running. Okay a little annoying but I can live with that.

Secondly is the extra power usage, she often has a dehumidifier running all the time, she has taken over the table in the living room with her chargers and is you know using power but she doesn't contribute to the bill. Last winter our power bill was roughly $90-$115 per person a month, this past months bill came in and my share was $158. Thats way more than it has ever been. I don't really care about rent because its insanely cheap anyway.

Thirdly and probably the most annoying thing is hot water. Our hot water cylinder is quite small and because of this stupid power saving thing it only heats up water at certain times of the day. With her putting the dishwasher on all the time and having 30ish minute showers by 7:30pm we have no hot water. I start work at 4:30am and hate having wet hair but when i asked if it was okay to use my hair dryer in the morning (at around 4am) they all said no thats to early and its loud, which is fair because it is very loud. So now it feels like a rush in the evening to have a shower. You also can't get hot water when the dishwasher or washing machine is on and lately she has been washing her clothes on hot at night then putting the dishwasher on so from 5-7 there's usually one or the other on. Which means there's no hot water left to have a shower. 

I can't shower earlier as I'm not usually home any earlier. I've actually been showering at a friends house for the past few days because having a cold shower when its 4 degrees really sucks.

I asked her to have shorter shower, not wash stuff on hot, and to chill out using the dishwasher all the time and she acted so offended. I tried explaining why and said it in a nice way (i think) and just explained how frustrating it is.

Now they are both not talking to me, and when i thought I had finally gotten 5 minutes of hot water for the first time in what feels like weeks they put the dishwasher on and it came out freezing.

AITA and just overreacting? Or would other people be annoyed too? ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-16,"AITA for asking my flatmates GF to not shower or put the dishwasher on? My flatmate (25m) has been dating this really nice woman for almost a year now, I have no problem when she hangs around or covers our entire lounge in sheets so she can paint. Shes a really nice person and we often talk about work since we are both in the social services field. 

As far as I'm aware she still has her own flat and doesn't technically live here but she spends pretty much 24/7 here and a few things are starting to get annoying. 

Firstly since its winter she often leaves the heat pump on in the lounge and personally since I spend most of my time in my room I never turn it on. There have been countless occasions that I've come home to an empty house with all the inside doors open and the heat pump still running. Okay a little annoying but I can live with that.

Secondly is the extra power usage, she often has a dehumidifier running all the time, she has taken over the table in the living room with her chargers and is you know using power but she doesn't contribute to the bill.

142,1e4l0o1,WIBTA if I ask my friend about her strange and borderline toxic relationship?,"Hi everyone!
This is a throwaway account because I don't want to complicate stuff more than it already is.

Two years ago this couple (M 26 - F 25) joined our group. The girl, Lisa (fake name), left all his life behind to come live with this guy, Alex (fake name too). She is so sweet and kind that the room lights up when she comes. She is shy, but we all love her energy and the way she is with us.

He's...an asshole. But not really. He LOVES to talk about himself and act like a victim even tho he is the problem. For example, he keeps on saying they don't have money, and he bought himself a PS5. WTF. He keeps on telling us how much he spent on her and that's...cringe. But sometimes he's fun and we see that he's not always an asshole.

He KEEPS on degrading Lisa. She tries to give him direction, he shout at her. She slaps (light as a feather) his shoulder to get rid of a bug, he goes into drama mode. It's like the whole world is around him and she's just an achievement in his videogame.

We went on a trip with them and Alex confided in us that he wants to propose to her during a trip in New York.

After the trip we were talking and all of us where like ""Yeah, I hope she says no"". But at the same time, we know Lisa will say eventually yes. She went to live with him and left everything (job, family, friend). They have two cats that they treat like their kids and I get that it's hard.

At the same time, we are not that close to talk about that stuff. She's reserved and we are not the type to ask out of the blue. She has friends with which she talks via messages. I believe they are her best friends. But she sees them like...twice a year? So I don't really know.

My brother told me to keep it to myself, that they are both adults, but I feel like I should say something. He said that I will make her leave the only friend group she has here.

But maybe I'm exaggerating? In Italy a girl was kd by his ex because she was getting the diploma before him and everyone was like ""Yeah, he was a creep"". And no one said shit. So I don't really know.

I still chose not to wear it.

She argued a bit. Then she told my dad and he told me it would be extra sweet and meaningful to make my stepmother happy and show love and acceptance for my third parent and third side of my family.

147,1e4kdqq,AITA for not sharing my food and refusing to talk to someone who might not have enough food at home?,"This is kind of a weird one, but here it is. This happened a while ago, but it recently came up when I was talking to some friends who weren‚Äôt there and they said I was being TA.   
  
Usually, a group of my friends and I sit at the same lunch table at school. Everything was great up until this girl I will call Lily came up and joined us. I recognized Lily from band, but we had never spoken before. It was a ways through the school year, so it was kind of strange that she was just not coming to our table.  That being said, we welcomed her to the table  and things were fine for a few days. Then she started asking us for some of our leftovers. She asked for things like uneaten apple slices and the cashew bits at the bottom of the bag and stuff. This was after she had just eaten her own lunch. It was kind of strange, but we gave them to her. We felt kind of bad for her since we assumed there wasn‚Äôt enough food at home or something and never made her feel bad for this, but after about a week of this she started asking for things we were actively eating/were clearly going to eat. She did this with everyone, but mostly focused on me. If I said no, she loudly pouted and would whine and hassle me for the rest of lunch. This went on for about a week (we all still let her have things we weren‚Äôt going to eat) until I finally snapped when she kept begging me for an Oreo. I told her I would not be giving her any more food and quit giving her things I wasn‚Äôt going to eat (don‚Äôt worry, the food didn‚Äòt entirely go to waste, I gave the chicken safe things to my pet chickens). My friends quit giving her food as well. 

After this all Lily would do is whine and bother us for food for the whole lunch period. My friends and I told her to knock it off, but she wouldn‚Äôt. We finally just stopped acknowledging her. If she spoke to us we didn‚Äôt respond. She blew up and started yelling at us about being racist bullies. Race had never come up and it‚Äôs not like we were sharing with everyone but her. We just didn‚Äôt want to be harassed while we ate out lunches. She did finally stop coming to put lunch table though.

This is kind of a weird one, but here it is. This happened a while ago, but it recently came up when I was talking to some friends who weren‚Äôt there and they said I was being TA.   
  
Usually, a group of my friends and I sit at the same lunch table at school. Everything was great up until this girl I will call Lily came up and joined us. I recognized Lily from band, but we had never spoken before. It was a ways through the school year, so it was kind of strange that she was just not coming to our table.  That being said, we welcomed her to the table  and things were fine for a few days. Then she started asking us for some of our leftovers. She asked for things like uneaten apple slices and the cashew bits at the bottom of the bag and stuff. This was after she had just eaten her own lunch. It was kind of strange, but we gave them to her. We felt kind of bad for her since we assumed there wasn‚Äôt enough food at home or something and never made her feel bad for this, but after about a week of this she started asking for things we were actively eating/were clearly going to eat. She did this with everyone, but mostly focused on me. If I said no, she loudly pouted and would whine and hassle me for the rest of lunch. This went on for about a week (we all still let her have things we weren‚Äôt going to eat) until I finally snapped when she kept begging me for an Oreo. I told her I would not be giving her any more food and quit giving her things I wasn‚Äôt going to eat (don‚Äôt worry, the food didn‚Äòt entirely go to waste, I gave the chicken safe things to my pet chickens). My friends quit giving her food as well. 

After this all Lily would do is whine and bother us for food for the whole lunch period. My friends and I told her to knock it off, but she wouldn‚Äôt. We finally just stopped acknowledging her. If she spoke to us we didn‚Äôt respond. She blew up and started yelling at us about being racist bullies. Race had never come up and it‚Äôs not like we were sharing with everyone but her. We just didn‚Äôt want to be harassed while we ate out lunches. She did finally stop coming to put lunch table though.

FOR CONTEXT: I should say that DH and I have not been intimate in over a year and a half‚Ä¶ OFC, my sex drive was down right after having our DD, but at some point I felt like I was doing it out of obligation. I voiced the need to feel emotionally connected to DH once I noticed it was becoming an issue. His way of connecting was simply to ask how my day was. So I continued going through the motions, but I quickly found that any form of physical touch signaled lead to obligatory, disconnected sex. 

On top of that, any time I said I was not in the mood, I could expect a guilt trip. He would use this time to air any marital frustrations. There guilt trip could last anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour. Sometimes I would concede, but the more I did, the more I felt used. When panic attacks began to set in, I had to cut off sex entirely or at least until I felt safe enough emotionally to initiate.

Needless to say, a year and a half later, things are not better. I have been in therapy basically the whole time, but he is doing nothing to work on himself. In fact, he has pushed my boundaries so much that we sleep in completely separate bedrooms. 

There have been three serious issues of SNOOPING. The 1st is when everything started, he was constantly sneaking into the bathroom when I was in the shower to try and get a glimpse of me naked. I even caught his phone on multiple occasions. He says he just misses me, but I feel violated. 

The 2nd SERIOUS incident of snooping happened a year ago when our DD wanted to play on his iPad. She loves looking at pictures of when she was a baby and somehow backed out to the albums menu of Photos. As I was going to choose an album for her, I noticed a ‚ÄúHidden‚Äù album and it had one 1 item. I clicked on it and found a thirty minute video.

We have been circling the drain for a year now, and I came home the other day to find out the 3rd case is snooping. He outright said he had gone through my iMessages on my Mac.

We reacted differently: he went out in the yard to make sure he could hear them, I stayed inside to make sure I would know as soon as they got back in the house. 

Once everyone was back inside, I pointed out that it would have been nice for my brother to mention he was going outside beforehand (he just walked out w/o saying anything) he replied back to me with ""I was out there because I was concerned, while you were inside eating food and sitting on your ass."" For context, I had just grabbed popsicle as people started trying to find my mom&sister.

His implication that I didn't care about my family because I didn't rush out to our yard with him was pretty hurtful. I understand that the moment was a high-stress situation, and I am trying not to take what he said to heart, but it is difficult when he kinda called me fat and apathetic.

Yesterday, I went thrifting with a friends, and when I came home I was holding the clothes without gloves on. We wore gloves while we were looking, and I felt like it would be fine to come inside and throw them in the wash, and change into new clothes. However, he had an issue with this. He asked if we had worn gloves while we were there, and I told him we did, and then he just scoffed and said how disgusting those clothes probably were after I said I was going to put them in the wash right away.

He has been to this exact thrift store before me, so I guess he thinks he's the expert and I don't know anything. And not to mention, gloves do not cover your entire arms, while your forearms often come into contact with other clothes while you're looking through stuff.

I understand these seem small, but they are somewhat out of the ordinary and the tone that he said them in leaves no room for gracious interpretation. I am trying not to let it get to me, but I feel like he thinks I'm a stupid, uncaring, out of shape idiot, and I have taken it personally.

He hasn't made any move to acknowledge that what he's said could have been hurtful, even though other people made it clear that he was being rude, so I think he just doesn't care, hence why I didn't take him to his friend's house today. When he asked why, I said that I didn't want to drive someone around who thinks I don't care about  family and thinks I'm unaware of how dirty things are.

I accept that I am being a bit of a baby about it, but if he had just said sorry at any point, I probably would have gotten over it.

TLDR: My(18f) brother(16m) said some things that hurt my feelings lately, asked me for a ride to his friend's house, and I said no because I didn't feel like driving someone who seemed to think poorly of me.

155,1e4j4qa,AITA for taking back my offer to help my son with housing. ,"My son and his family are struggling. It's hard out there I know. He came to me to see if I could help him with rent for a few months.

I said that I would. And I did. I gave him $2000. That was 2/3 of his rent for two months. It was a gift. I didn't expect it back.

I thought about my granddaughter growing up in that little apartment and I started looking around without talking to him first. That was 100% my own fault.

I found a townhouse for a reasonable price. If I put down a huge down payment then I could let my son and his family move in there and it would only cost $850 a month for the mortgage and property taxes.

It was close to my granddaughter's school and only five blocks from their current apartment.

I took my son and daughter in law to see it and told them about my idea. They could live there and get a much better home for their family for just a little over half their current rent.

That would give them on opportunity to save up, pay down bills, whatever you know.

They said that it was a very generous gift. I corrected them. I was buying the house by taking money from my retirement account. I would need it back. They got really mad that they would be paying a mortgage and not getting equity in the property.

It has devolved I to a big fight. I no longer wished to participate and so I told the agent to let it go.

My agent called me because my son had asked her to take him to see it again and she was confused because I had said I was no longer interested. It was already pending for another buyer.

Now my son is upset with me for taking away a house with a yard from his daughter.

It seems like no.matter what I do I have done something wrong.

157,1e4j2ib,AITA for telling my aunt that she visited on the wrong day,"So, a little back story, I(18F) just finished high school and is currently preparing for college entrance exams. I have always had a rocky relationship with my aunt because of the way she always treated me as an outsider/outcast in my cousins group consisting of my own sister(23F), her twins (17F and 17M).  
  
We have had our fair share of disagreements in the past in which she often degraded me. I never told this to my parents because I have a strained relationship with my father ever since I was kid due to his alcoholism and he often gets out of control. Clearly my mother is the submissive in the house and she has little to no say in anything. Moreover, I didn't think it would help.   
  
Thing kept going downhill between me and my aunt. Somehow my dislike for her extended to her kids too. There were a lot of conflicts in the past years. But ever since the distance after the covid pandemic, everything just settled down wherever it was. In the previous year we have gotten closer with my aunt and my cousins. They visited several times, which is a lot due to the hectic school schedule.  
  
My cousins are pretty average in their studies, a little worse than me considering the fact my aunt still has control of their studying schedule and is very much involved in their studying along with their army of tutors. my cousins ended up missing many major events because of their exams and there have been instances where I literally begged them to attend with me, but my aunt refused because of their exams. But it's fine, I don't hold a grudge.  
  
Back to the matter in hand, last week (Wednesday) I had my college entrance exam which I have working really hard for. On Monday, I was informed about my aunt coming to visit. Now, on Tuesday, she arrives with my cousin, whom I was not informed about that she was also coming. I went to her and greeted her and said it to her that she visited on the wrong day since I have a very important exam the next day and I won't be able to spend any time with her or my cousin. She apologized and said that I should've informed her about it, and I told her I didn't know about my cousin accompanying her.   
  
That conversation soon died down as soon as my grandma joined. it was not talked about again and I pretty much forgot about it.  
  
On Friday, my aunt called my father to talk about this and how I told her she visited on the wrong day, and we should have informed her when it's appropriate to visit and how I ""misbehaved"" with her. As I mentioned before, I do not have a good relationship with my father and I am, kind of, scared of his behavior after he drinks. It did not do any good for the situation.

My sister brought her home and we were thankfully able to save her. We found out that the cat was pregnant and was going to give birth. Almost a month after this the cat, Monkey, gave birth.

After this happened shit hit the fan. Over the next few months, Monkey became extremely aggressive towards our other cats and actively chased them/harmed them. My sister brushed it off and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that big of a deal, the cats fight all the time.‚Äù Our other cats for the most part play fight, they‚Äôre very gentle and if it goes too far and one of them doesn‚Äôt want to participate, we break it up.

Monkey went after my other cat, Chester. Chester is my baby boy and is also my step-grandma‚Äôs cat. She is in a nursing home. I promised I would take great care of him and keep him safe since all of her other pets sadly had to be rehomed as well. Chester means a lot to our family and is widely regarded as the whole house‚Äôs cat. He is very gentle.

161,1e4ivlq,AITA for refusing to move out of my shared flat so my friend‚Äôs family member can move in?,"I‚Äôm a 24M living abroad with my friend/flatmate, 26M, who is also from a different country. We met in fall 2021 through a mutual friend and became part of a friend group. Initially, I lived in a 7-person flat, and he lived in a 2-person flat with a mutual friend who left the country in early 2023. My future flatmate invited me to move in with him, not wanting a stranger as a flatmate. After some thought, I moved into his flat in the spring of 2023. Despite some disagreements and lifestyle differences, we made it work and our friendship grew stronger. I was happy with the flat and keen on living here for the foreseeable future. Things took a drastic change recently.

We knew for some time that a family member of his wanted to study at a local university and move to our city. While the idea was floated around, no serious conversations about logistics occurred until this week. On Monday, he told me he wanted his relative to live in our flat and take my room. I told him that while I understood he wanted to live with family, I had no plans of moving out and wasn't keen on finding a new place. I suggested he should be the one who moves out and finds a place to share with his relative. He didn't want to accept my answer and said that he and his cousin would outbid me for my room, leveraging their wealth. I was appalled by this idea. He claimed he was separating our friendship from the living arrangement and didn‚Äôt consider how it affected me. I told him our friendship would never be the same after this and that I no longer considered him one of my best friends. He seemed indifferent, only responding that he would try to rebuild things after everything blew over.

To try to mend things, I wanted to discuss this topic with our mutual friends to get their perspectives. He shut down this idea, stating, ""I don't care what they have to say. They don't live here, and what's happening here doesn't concern them. You will try to use what they say against me."" I went ahead and asked for their opinions anyway. They agreed he was being the asshole. He was upset when they messaged him, criticizing his actions. He is saying how I am being an asshole in this situation by trying to portray him as an asshole and for trying to victimize myself, for blowing this out of proportion and causing a scene.

My actions that should be judged are refusing to move out of our shared flat and talking to our mutual friends about the situation without his approval. I might be the asshole because my refusal and involving our friends might seem like I‚Äôm not considering his needs and causing unnecessary drama.

I think I might be the asshole because:

I refused to move out of our shared flat to accommodate his relative.

I‚Äôm a 24M living abroad with my friend/flatmate, 26M, who is also from a different country. We met in fall 2021 through a mutual friend and became part of a friend group. Initially, I lived in a 7-person flat, and he lived in a 2-person flat with a mutual friend who left the country in early 2023. My future flatmate invited me to move in with him, not wanting a stranger as a flatmate. After some thought, I moved into his flat in the spring of 2023. Despite some disagreements and lifestyle differences, we made it work and our friendship grew stronger. I was happy with the flat and keen on living here for the foreseeable future. Things took a drastic change recently.

We knew for some time that a family member of his wanted to study at a local university and move to our city. While the idea was floated around, no serious conversations about logistics occurred until this week. On Monday, he told me he wanted his relative to live in our flat and take my room. I told him that while I understood he wanted to live with family, I had no plans of moving out and wasn't keen on finding a new place. I suggested he should be the one who moves out and finds a place to share with his relative. He didn't want to accept my answer and said that he and his cousin would outbid me for my room, leveraging their wealth. I was appalled by this idea. He claimed he was separating our friendship from the living arrangement and didn‚Äôt consider how it affected me. I told him our friendship would never be the same after this and that I no longer considered him one of my best friends. He seemed indifferent, only responding that he would try to rebuild things after everything blew over.

To try to mend things, I wanted to discuss this topic with our mutual friends to get their perspectives. He shut down this idea, stating, ""I don't care what they have to say. They don't live here, and what's happening here doesn't concern them. You will try to use what they say against me."" I went ahead and asked for their opinions anyway. They agreed he was being the asshole. He was upset when they messaged him, criticizing his actions. He is saying how I am being an asshole in this situation by trying to portray him as an asshole and for trying to victimize myself, for blowing this out of proportion and causing a scene.

My actions that should be judged are refusing to move out of our shared flat and talking to our mutual friends about the situation without his approval. I might be the asshole because my refusal and involving our friends might seem like I‚Äôm not considering his needs and causing unnecessary drama.

I think I might be the asshole because:

I refused to move out of our shared flat to accommodate his relative.

I talked to our mutual friends about the situation without his approval, which upset him and made him feel attacked.

*a lot of this is backstory i'm so sorry it felt necessary*

i (22f) have a sister (19f) who i just genuinely can't get myself to care for anymore beyond the line of ""well you're my sister"". for a while (maybe since i was 18) i just had moments every now and then when i realized that i just really didn't like her as a person. she's rude, disrespectful, troublemaker, etc. stuff along those lines. got in trouble in school a lot, argues with my mom the most, fought a lot until she became an adult all that. while i guess i'm the opposite? scared to get in trouble in school, too anxious to fight anyone and was for sure scared of my mom.

me not liking her never became anything serious until last year. when she started posting conspiracy theories after he birthday on social media and saying things like she saved a soul and escaped the matrix, all that. it wasn't serious for a while so i didn't bring it up, just joked about it but then it became so serious i felt the need to bring it up with our mom.

i'm an overly anxious person that thinks anything i do is gonna result in something negative so it take maybe 2 weeks after it becomes serious to say something to my mom but i can't really be serious when talking so i play it off and set it up as a joke that my mom agrees with (said something like your daughter is gonna be a full blown conspiracy theorist or a cult leader when she grows up) but then i gotta get real and say ""yeah she's posting all this stuff"" but nothing comes of it.

i'm not antagonistic at all but everything about her was just getting on my nerves at that point so i showed her as anxious as i was about it. i  guess everything was getting on her nerves too because a week or two later she comes and confronts me on ""my energy towards her being off"" and i laugh and tell her to literally just stop talking to me but she walks away a little and then doubles down saying ""you're not gonna act like this towards me"" alright i'll bite. and i tell her about how i felt. we don't fight but instead i end up breaking down crying because i don't feel like it should have come to that and i'm more sad and frustrated that i'm seeing her act like that and spew nonsense like that because at the end of the day that's my sister who i love.

we're good and that lasts until march of this year.

*MAIN POINT I GUESS*

my family is black and i'm the darkest. been teased about my skintone as i was even darker when i was a child probably just like every other darkskin kid. i'm not really sensitive about it anymore but who would wanna hear anything negative about their skin? family is playing scattergories and somewhere on the card my sister is looking at has a prompt-""something black""-to which my sister says my name and laughs. (nobody else does, mom ""doesn't hear her""). i've never joked about my skin ESPECIALLY WITH MY FAMILY! ESPECIALLY WITH MY SISTER! i tell her ""you're fucking weird"" because it was. we're all black but she means it in the negative way (""you're so black you're damn near purple"", stuff like that) and that ruins my night and i make the decision to stop talking to her for a while. i've done it for like a day or so when i was depressed and everything was just piling on me but this situation wasn't like that. this was just me deciding i don't wanna be around her, i don't wanna talk to her and i don't like her.

i'm ""at peace"" with the fact that i don't like her as a person at this point and she shows that she really doesn't give a fuck because she doesn't talk to me either. cool. don't really care at this moment. like i said i'm not antagonistic and i don't go around looking for a fight but my sister is and when she doesn't get a reaction out of someone who she has or wants to have a problem with she shows it. talking shit while walking away, laughing randomly near me and near me only, shit like that. i'm bothered and kinda in my head but i don't really care, she's done stuff like this after arguments before.

i want to note that we had that game night and started saving weekly movie night like we did before co-19 because SHE wanted to spend more time with us. but she's so mad and confused about whatever the fuck that she stops watching movies with us. weeks go on at this point and at the end of april me and my mom are going to the store and i ask if my sister is coming with us. she tells me no. when i get in the car and we're literally only around the corner she says ""i haven't talked to your sister for 2 weeks"". so it's not just me. come to find out in the next couple days it's not just me or my mom, it's our whole family and even my grandmom.

i know why i'm not getting spoken to, my mom isn't getting spoken to because she wouldn't get her something (like a jodie or something), don't know why she stopped talking to my grandmom or my siblings. she just decided she didn't want to talk to us anymore and nobody really cared because we know how she is.

for a while i think something is really wrong like she's slipped into depression after what i thought was an ego death and she's cutting us all off before she does something to herself (which i'm still not gonna rule out even so long after because depression is different on everyone) so now i'm a little scared. nothing happens and some time after we're going to my grandmas house for something and she's talking and joking with everyone, even me.

i'm mostly over the comment she made at game night because i feel like it's better to move on so i gladly follow suit with everyone else and just go back to normal. well we get home and realize that was just something she was doing because we were in front of other people because she's not talking to anyone again and continues not to for the rest of time between then and when i'm writing this.

i had come to realize that the more she doesn't get her way or get what she wants and has everything perfect the more ""reserved"" she becomes kinda. she's been like that since her late teens but nothings ever been done about it other than an argument between her and my mom.

some of the stuff she's said/done between then and now;
- said she doesn't amhave any clothes and she's embarrassed to be outside because her ""supporters will see her"" and that mom mom doesn't buy her and my other siblings clothes
- gone on about 3 rants proving she's dumb and can't take anything (like literal facts) when they don't align with her feelings that she thinks are facts
- proves time and time again that she doesn't understand the concept of family and says our family is all combined and all a family despite knowing there are practically 3 sides of the family for us (2 on moms side and 1 on dads side - her brain can't function when told that all those people are HER/OUR family and not all family just because my parents gave birth to her)
- has started a yt channel talking about all this with our actual names and saying stuff like she's gonna move away and her her own family and generation with her kids
- also talk on her youtube about having the privilege to stay at home and work on her music that she's making (it's fairly good too) and she doesn't need to work because my mom provides ... 19 btw
- tried to start an argument with me and touch my food in our oven because she wanted to use the microwave and then got mad when i didn't talk to her and said ""what you can't speak now"" after not talking to her family for months

ofc there's more but i don't care to list them because i don't care. until she can grasp the fact that she doesn't need to be mean when she doesn't get her way and she definitely doesn't need to act weird over the fact that her family isn't all family just because of her, i don't care about about anything she says or does as long as she doesn't get in major trouble or die.",TL;DR,2024-07-16,"AITA for not caring about my sister and her ""issues"" ? *LONG*/*never used reddit before sorry for mistakes*/*sorry if this doesn't fit here*

My friend was acting a little weird over the next few days, she was completely friendly but she was also a little distant. I knew it must have been because of my audition but I figured it wouldn‚Äôt matter once the cast list came out. When it did come out, I was cast as Hamlet. My friend was the understudy. I was shocked, but I was also really excited. My other friends came up to congratulate me, all except my best friend, who started screaming at me when I found her to tell her the news. She told me I had betrayed her and lied to her because I said I was only auditioning for Ophelia. Even though I said that I only read for Hamlet because the professor told me to and I didn‚Äôt intend for it to be like this, she told me that she was the one who worked day and night to prepare for the role and it was rightfully hers, and I don‚Äôt get to waltz in and steal it from her. She demanded that I should give it up for her or that she was never going to speak to me again.¬†

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I know I never intentionally caused this but I still feel guilty because my friend really did work hard for this role and I saw it with my own two eyes.

I‚Äôd rather audition for Laertes or Ophelia instead. So she, our other friends and I, showed up at the venue to audition. I went up and read for Ophelia, and my friend read for Hamlet. After the last person auditioning for Hamlet was done, all of a sudden, the professor was calling my name, and asking if I would be willing to read for Hamlet. I was a little stunned, but I said okay, and I read ‚ÄúAlas, Poor Yorick.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt expect to be asked to audition for it, but it was the lead role, so I gave it my all.¬†

My friend was acting a little weird over the next few days, she was completely friendly but she was also a little distant. I knew it must have been because of my audition but I figured it wouldn‚Äôt matter once the cast list came out. When it did come out, I was cast as Hamlet. My friend was the understudy. I was shocked, but I was also really excited. My other friends came up to congratulate me, all except my best friend, who started screaming at me when I found her to tell her the news. She told me I had betrayed her and lied to her because I said I was only auditioning for Ophelia. Even though I said that I only read for Hamlet because the professor told me to and I didn‚Äôt intend for it to be like this, she told me that she was the one who worked day and night to prepare for the role and it was rightfully hers, and I don‚Äôt get to waltz in and steal it from her. She demanded that I should give it up for her or that she was never going to speak to me again.¬†

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I know I never intentionally caused this but I still feel guilty because my friend really did work hard for this role and I saw it with my own two eyes. But I really do want to play Hamlet now, because I feel like this could be a good opportunity for me and I could even enjoy this. AITA if I still kept my role?",0.0,-0.0013073112349957228,0,1

Even when my bsf asks me about my family issues, I don‚Äôt tell her everything and I think she started noticing that. 

One day she called me and told me that I should vent to her and I told her there was no reason for me to do that, because I don‚Äôt have any issues.

168,1e4i21z,AITA for questioning an artist about the use of AI? ,"Long story short, I was looking to have a design made and went to ask an artist I know. They normally wouldn't do this sort of thing but accepted the job (and was paid for it). 

I expected to get just one design, but received three versions. This was nice ofc, but something just seemed off. A random thing I hadn't asked for had been added to one of the designs and on closer inspection there were traces of a watermark on a small part of all three designs. On top of that some of the line work seemed inconsistent and just looked odd to me. 

I really didn't want to accuse the artist of trying to scam me (as I could never see them do that!) but nonetheless I just felt I had to ask. 

It didn't go over well. They were very hurt by me asking, despite saying they understood why and that they had indeed used stock images for the small part with a watermark on it in an attempt to offer me more than just one design. I apologised, but the artist refused to keep my money and sent them back to me - telling me I could use the designs however I wanted. 

I didn't want to dig deeper into the subject, but even though I believe them when they say they didn't use AI, something still seems off about it all.

169,1e4hzqp,AITA for arguing with my bf about his parents ,"My bf(27M) and I (26F) met at university When we were both international students. He was doing his PhD degree in a highly promising field while I was working on my master's degree in Education, which is not a very competitive career.

I graduated this year and am struggling to have a full-time job, currently have a part-time job. He is still at the university. We have been living together for one and a half years sharing the rent equally. He pays more for other living expenses. After a few months of being together, He became a permanent resident in this country and now is sponsoring me for immigration.

His parents recently bought a semi-detached house in the city where we currently live. His parents will pay the mortgage until he graduates and gets a job. I am rent-free at that time, only needing to share the utilities.

I have an apartment in another country that my grandma gave to me, which has the same value as this house, and I don't have a mortgage on it. 

His parents recently visited us for one month. Since he left home at a young age, he wants to spend more time with them. We went to their place ( the house they bought) every day for dinner, which I found very tiring. I would like to be alone or just with my boyfriend. I feel that the boundaries with his parents are too close. I also went to the airport to pick them up and every weekend we spent together involved a lot of driving.

I'm scared this would be my daily routine In the future. 

Another thing that broke my heart was the second day I met his parents. they had an argument. His parents don‚Äôt like me and said we weren‚Äôt suitable for each other. They wanted him to break up with me. That night, he came home and told me he would try to make it work, but if his parents continued to dislike me, we would have to break up because he didn‚Äôt want to lose his family. ( the reason they didn't like me is because I didn't wash the dishes, can't believe it.) 

But it‚Äôs not all bad. After spending several more days with his parents, I think they have started to accept me. However, I know that if there‚Äôs ever an argument between me and his parents, he will always choose them.

I suggested taking the fast shipment so it could arrive in one day, but she cannot afford to pay for the more expensive shipment.

So I just did what I thought I should; I ordered and shipped the item to her using the fast shipment for her. She was grateful and I was glad it was resolved, and all we had to do is wait for the next day for the item to arrive. Or so we thought.

The next day, the shipment app showed the notification that the package has arrived at my friend's dorm. I told my friend about it but when she checked, it wasn't anywhere to be found. Porch theft is not really a thing here so we didn't think about it at that moment.

She asked if the shipping courier uploaded a photo proof of the item being delivered and I showed her the photo. It wasn't her dormitory. Or any other building near her location. We were so confused, where did they send the package to?

So I made a complaint to the shipping company asking them to investigate the case, because my friend really needs the item. Thinking her research gets delayed causing academic problems to her made me anxious. 

Now, this isn't the first time they sent her package to the wrong address, so while complaining, I also brought up the issue about the previous incident. I did not shout at the person on the phone (reddit has taught me a lot about customer service experiences so I tried to behave), but I did sound a bit desperate and distraught. I asked them to handle the case as soon as they can.

Today, my friend was contacted by apparently the person who delivered the package yesterday. My friend was a bit shaken because the man called her on the phone and he was angry at her!
He claimed that he did deliver to the right address; it's just that he uploaded the wrong photo proof and uploaded a photo of someone else's house instead.
How could we know that?
I think the company reprimanded the guy, that's why he's really upset and scolded my friend.

My friend is soft spoken and she is not confrontational, so the call made her really confused and she cried afterwards.
I feel bad about it; I should have been the one on the call with the delivery guy and sort things out because I was the one who made the complaint.
But at the same time, I don't think we are in the wrong. We literally didn't know what was going on.

172,1e4hb5y,"AITA to voice it out to my friend about her ""help issues""?","Hey everyone! I just had a sudden question to ask of you, I have a friend who consistently asks for help, like for basically everything and anything. I work from home sometimes and even at those times that friend of mine keeps asking for help. The help I'm talking about it can be difficult tasks to do (which I'm not bothered by) or very simple ones (for example, switching on the lights for my friend when I'm in the other room).

Lately it's been getting on my nerves because when I'm gaming with my friends or working on something important, unsurprisingly my friend will ask for help. If I don't help, all I receive is death glares and stomping's. I have discussed with her about it, but I can't seem to understand her reasons.  
REASON 1: ""If I asked that means I really need it""  
REASON 2: "" Why can't you be helpful around the house""

I do joke about saying that I can receive a million dollars with the number of times that I've been asked to ""help"". I do say no when I really don't feel like helping or when I just can't help. I did voice out that this is too much and for someone older, if you can't do simple task, how do you live your life then? Even someone who lost a limb, or lives in a worse condition can do simple tasks or heavy ones if they put their heart into it.

I couldnt deal with the pathetic look from my friend. I really am not keen with someone who appears weak to me. Simple things should be just done by yourself and I dont think people need 80% of ""help"" throughout the day

P.S we live together, and I don't want to start and argument on it again  
But I really need to know, is this like a mental disorder or it's just attitude issues?

173,1e4h86p,AITA for wanting my prize from a sweepstake?,"Throwaway in use to keep this separate from my main account.

During the Euros football tournament that has just finished, I have been a part of a sweepstake with my boyfriend, and several of our friends and their partners (6 in total). Each person committed ¬£5 each, with the winner getting the pot. Each person randomly drew 4 teams (the top 6 teams in the competition were drawn first, then the next 6 etc.) I drew Spain, who have ended up winning.

We agreed in advance that no one would hold onto the money, and that everyone would pay the winner directly at the end. Yesterday (Monday) morning, I shared my payment details in our group chat, and said that if anyone wanted to send money in a different way, to get in touch. I did get 2 people send their portion over by lunchtime, but early in the afternoon, one of the guys, and shortly after his girlfriend, both sent messages in the group saying that while they were happy about the result, they weren‚Äôt going to be sending over any money. My boyfriend and another friend immediately called them out and said that it wasn‚Äôt part of the deal to not send over their share of the pot. Their response was that because England had lost to Spain, ‚Äòno-one wins‚Äô, and that paying anyone to ‚Äòcelebrate‚Äô an England loss wasn‚Äôt fair. As I was at work, I wasn‚Äôt able to respond at the time these messages were being shared. By the time I was back on my phone, I‚Äôd received a message from another friend (one who‚Äôd already paid) saying that the final member of the group had told them that they were not going to pay out either, and that I‚Äôd just have to deal with it.

I messaged the group overall to say that it was a shame some people weren‚Äôt playing by the rules we‚Äôd agreed, especially when they know I‚Äôd have sent the money over to whoever won, and had done so the last two times we‚Äôd had a sweepstake like this (to note, this was the first time the couple was taking part; the final guy had taken part before, and to my knowledge, had paid out previously). About an hour later, both my boyfriend and I found that we‚Äôd been blocked by the couple, and the final person had left the group chat 5 minutes after I‚Äôd sent my message.

It‚Äôs less so missing out on around ¬£15 that I‚Äôm bothered by, but more the principle. We agreed on ¬£5 as this was a suitable amount to ‚Äòlose‚Äô, so I don‚Äôt believe that anyone wasn‚Äôt keen on paying because of financial limitations.

175,1e4h6nf,AITA for telling BD that MIL is not to be involved,"So for a little context, I use the term MIL in the title to keep it simple when referring to the relationship with her.

I‚Äôm currently pregnant and the father and I are NOT together but plan on coparenting. We get along great and have feelings for each other, but he‚Äôs not ready for a stable romantic relationship after his past ones, and honestly a relationship is not my top priority, our child is. I only met his mother recently after finding out about being pregnant and he had never really talked much about her or any of his family. I‚Äôve known him, I‚Äôll refer to him as Garth, for 3 or 4 years now. After finding out about being pregnant, he opened up a bit more about his mother and their ‚Äòrelationship‚Äô. Over the last year she would only reach out to him when she wanted his help with something and for 6 years before that, she didn‚Äôt talk to him at all and didn‚Äôt even know if he was alive.

Now fast forward to finding out about my pregnancy. He had told his mother, I‚Äôll refer to her as Reba, about how he‚Äôs going to be a father and only told her my first name. That same week I got a random friend request on FB and a message and it was Reba reaching out to me, wanting to get to know me. I talked a bit with her for a while and things seemed fine, she only had good things to say about Garth and our situation and everything seemed fine.

But it started getting weird when she showed up at my job to meet me in person instead of trying to set up a time to. She then managed to find my cellphone number somehow and started texting me that way. Things really escalated when she found my mother on FB and started messaging her. It started the same with my mother, wanting to meet up and get to know each other, nice small talk. But then my mother sent a single invite to an event and Reba started messaging my mother, questioning the paternity of my child when Garth himself hasn‚Äôt questioned the paternity. When confronted about it by me, Reba tried telling me that Garth had told her that I had told him it was possible that he wasn‚Äôt the father, which I already know never happened. She then told Garth that my mother had been harassing her to go to this event, which I also know never happened since I read the messages myself and also showed Garth.

But the last straw was when she again made comments about my child‚Äôs paternity at the gender reveal! She then also managed to find my best friend on FB and try to ask her how to get me to open up to her more not even an hour after the reveal! I ended up calling Garth and explaining that it was out of hand and that I thought it was best if he talked to her and handled her seeing as she‚Äôs his mother. I also told him that as it stands, I do not want her at the baby shower, I do not want her to try visiting us in the hospital, and I do not want her having my/our address (we‚Äôre trying to get a place together before baby arrives) and he said he understands and that‚Äôs okay.

But they are sweetheats ofc but i feel left out or not giving my best as i dont have alot of opinions about anyone.

When i started asking him with alot of heartbreak n tears. ‚ÄúYou know that what i have been through, Why are you redoing it in worst way possible ‚Äú after every mistake he makes he replies ‚Äú Oh you did tolerated all this with your ex but you dont wanna forgive me?, so you loved him more than?‚Äù 
Saying that he shuts me off everytime i get mad at his wrong doings‚Ä¶. 
I have no friends as he says you can make friends but when i do he says oh you should only have female friends, as i only have guy friends being a guy. Well i dont have female friends- reason being i dont like gossiping too much thats why never had strong bonds with female friends. But they are sweetheats ofc but i feel left out or not giving my best as i dont have alot of opinions about anyone. 
He shuts me up everytime I complain why are you not giving me time. But he put me in a situation where i have no one except him and he has a over power on me.

178,1e4gkas,WIBTA if I told my mom that I don't really want to live with her again?,"**Backstory:** I posted on here about 2 years ago about a situation where I was trying to move in with my dad and my mom would not allow me to. Since then, some crazy stuff happened and we got evicted. My mom and half-sister stayed with my dad and I for a while and they left about two months ago. Since then, it has just been me (15F) and my dad.

**Here's my predicament:** My mom believes that I have free reign to do whatever I want because my dad works a lot and isn't home often. This is not true. I am currently on summer break, so I don't have many responsibilities other than basic upkeep of my space and the house. I do have more freedom when it's just me & him, but of course he still has expectations and rules. When I visit my mom I feel like she drags me down and I don't know why. She loves me & we get along, but she holds me back and I don't think she even realizes it.

**For example:** My state has a free tuition STEM boarding school and I plan to apply to it. There are two campuses. One is about 45 mins away from me, and the other is about 3 hours. Neither are ideal, but it's an amazing opportunity and comes with great benefits. I bring this up to her and she says that she doesn't want me to be living on my own even after I assure her that I will be safe on the campus. She has completely said no to me going to the campus 3 hours away, but it's not up to me which one I get accepted to. I can only rank my preference. My dad on the other hand is very supportive of this, and he encourages me to take advantage of every opportunity possible. I have always been independent to an extent, and I would be fine at the school on the off chance that I get accepted. She just refuses to hear me out and probably doesn't understand how much my academic future matters to me.

**Another example:** She constantly nags me about how I live. I'm currently going through a lot because the past year(s) of my life have been one bad thing after another and I couldn't get a break. Until now. I can finally relax without the toxic stressors in my life that kept popping up. Some things I cannot erase from my head. My mental health has made me care less, so I haven't been eating well. That on top of the stress + other girl shit has made me break out and gain a bit of weight. I'm trying to work on it, but her comments about my diet do not help at all as they are condescending & I'm already aware of it. It makes me feel like shit.

She has talked about me living with her again in the future, but I don't want to. I already had to move schools mid freshman year, and I'm doing well in my new school. I do not want to uproot my life again and have to start over. I also feel like I'm better off with my dad in a less stressful environment. If I tell her that I don't want to live with her, I'm afraid our relationship may be affected (making me the asshole). **Apologies for the long rant, but would I be the asshole if I told her I just want to stay w/ my dad until I'm an adult?**

179,1e4gk6d,AITA for asking my gbsf for his exgfs stuff?,"Am I the asshole? I've seen so many of these on social media and I decided to make one of my own.¬†

For context I'm 21 F, and my guy best friend 20 M, who we'll call James. James had his girlfriend (now ex-girlfriend) 22 F, who we'll call Addie.¬†

Me and James have been friends for around two years now and have grown extremely close, even more so since Addie had moved away to Utah (we live in California). Past few weeks James had come to me for advice because his relationship with Addie had become complicated. From what he told me they were fighting and not talking for days at a time, the advice I gave was to try and work it out and to give it time not to make any decisions he'll regret. They ended up taking a break. After my shift I checked my phone to a notification from James.. they had broken up and he was freaking out.¬†

A WEEK goes by and I get a text from James, he wanted to talk about something important to him. I agreed like normal and came to find out a week down to the day he had already started talking to another girl.. We'll call her Gargamel, 19 F. He had started talking to her and wanted 'my blessing' but I didn't understand, I felt disgusted by him.¬†

A few weeks go by and we remain friends just not as close as we were before due to Gargamel not wanting him to be like he was before with me, (hugging, sharing drinks, going out for lunch, hanging out, not even him holding my stuff when we're out) it was hard but he was my best friend, I was willing to do what I had to in order to keep our friendship. Until one day when James completely cussed me out in front of our friends. A day after that he begged me for forgiveness.

A few days ago Addie asked me if I could ask James for a few of her things he had (a few jackets, a blanket, some of her bracelets and also her quince ring) and if I could hold onto them until she came to visit. I agreed and decided to ask James, when I did he said no, he apparently didn't have it.
Hours later James texted me and basically demanded I cut contact with Addie, like I was his and I wasn't allowed to talk to her. I declined and said I could talk to who I please and it isn't his decision. He apologized and said he didn't like it when I talked to her. 

The next day Addie texted me and told me she texted James's mom (Addie and James's mom were close and his mom loved Addie). The next thing I knew James texted and said he would come drop off Addie's things after I got out of work later that day. He did just that. I looked for his jeep and saw him leaving his car with a trash bag filled with her things. I walked towards his jeep. I reached out to grab the bag, opening it, He took no time to pull out the tiny bag he had in his pocket that he said had her jewelry. I said thank you and watched as he went back into his car.

 i moved out this past weekend & it was a complete mess. the other roommates had clearly started packing the same day i was moving out even though they‚Äôd been there for this whole time. i had packed up 90% of my stuff before i left, it was just a matter of getting it out. i had made arrangements to get a u-haul storage unit for the 3 weeks between leases to make it easier to move in to my next apt. u-haul screwed up & did not give me a storage unit & notified me of this day of. so, while i packed & emptied my room my mom was on the phone with storage unit places for over 2 hrs & my dad was loading the truck.

Text I sent: Quite frankly, seeing you last night with a beaming smile on your face looking perfectly fine was the most infuriating sight I have encountered in quite some time. 

Cancelling on meeting my friends when the people, the food, and the meeting itself, was catered for you solely in mind should only be acceptable if you have truly fallen ill. I‚Äôve given you a substantial amount of grace with this but I really do believe that it was unacceptable. 

And to top it off with you saying to me ‚Äúare you mad? Because if you are it‚Äôs ok!‚Äù nearly sent me over the edge with how insensitive you were acting. And by this point, if you still cannot see how inappropriate and disrespectful that was, I believe I have nothing more to say to you. 


Context to the dinner and the aftermath:
Based on his general character, I planned a dinner with two friends who I figured would best get along with him. On top of that, we planned all of the food around his dietary restrictions. An hour before dinner, he texted saying that he wasn‚Äôt feeling well and that he felt nauseous - he cancelled. 

By this point we had already gotten all of the food set up and so there was nothing else we could do. We ended up having the dinner but unfortunately the two friends I invited were not getting along well. These two friends in particular were chosen by me as I truly felt that with him there, it would balance out perfectly. Anyways, dinner was wrapped up quickly as I was worried he was sick and not feeling well. 

I ended up rushing back to his place to check up on him. When I showed up, he was smiling, freshly showered, singing a fucking tune, and happy to see me. He most definitely did not look sick. He apologized for not making it and suggested that they meet another time. 

My line of logic is, if you are suddenly feeling fine, you would make an effort to show up or at least feign feeling sick. I think what was most hurtful is how he dismissive he was of the whole thing. On top of this, after seeing my disappointment, he says to me ‚Äúare you mad? It‚Äôs okay if you are!‚Äù. I believe this last line sent me over the edge and I proceeded to go home and write up this text which I sent to him exactly 24 hours later. He has yet to reply at this time‚Ä¶

Cancelling on meeting my friends when the people, the food, and the meeting itself, was catered for you solely in mind should only be acceptable if you have truly fallen ill. I‚Äôve given you a substantial amount of grace with this but I really do believe that it was unacceptable. 

And to top it off with you saying to me ‚Äúare you mad? Because if you are it‚Äôs ok!‚Äù nearly sent me over the edge with how insensitive you were acting. And by this point, if you still cannot see how inappropriate and disrespectful that was, I believe I have nothing more to say to you. 


Context to the dinner and the aftermath:
Based on his general character, I planned a dinner with two friends who I figured would best get along with him. On top of that, we planned all of the food around his dietary restrictions. An hour before dinner, he texted saying that he wasn‚Äôt feeling well and that he felt nauseous - he cancelled. 

By this point we had already gotten all of the food set up and so there was nothing else we could do. We ended up having the dinner but unfortunately the two friends I invited were not getting along well. These two friends in particular were chosen by me as I truly felt that with him there, it would balance out perfectly. Anyways, dinner was wrapped up quickly as I was worried he was sick and not feeling well. 

I ended up rushing back to his place to check up on him. When I showed up, he was smiling, freshly showered, singing a fucking tune, and happy to see me. He most definitely did not look sick. He apologized for not making it and suggested that they meet another time. 

My line of logic is, if you are suddenly feeling fine, you would make an effort to show up or at least feign feeling sick. I think what was most hurtful is how he dismissive he was of the whole thing. On top of this, after seeing my disappointment, he says to me ‚Äúare you mad? It‚Äôs okay if you are!‚Äù. I believe this last line sent me over the edge and I proceeded to go home and write up this text which I sent to him exactly 24 hours later. He has yet to reply at this time‚Ä¶

The biggest issue we have is that we have a salad for dinner every night. We usually use a sesame dressing, our favorite, or my stepmom will make us a vinaigrette but she refuses to eat vegetables without ranch so when she's here we have to eat our salad with ranch or put dressing on our individual plated, which is really hard to get the amount right. 

The other day she was here because her stepmom took her on a girls trip to Spain and she didn't have anyone else to brag to. My stepmom asked me to make the salad and when I was done I put the sesame dressing on it. My stepmom asked about it and I said it's all of our favorites so it made sense to put it on the salad.

188,1e4fz3q,AITA for asking a family member to license their flatbed trailer instead of using mine,"I (41M) recently tried to bring up an issue that had bothered me for awhile. My partner (37F) and I live on some property and have a couple trailers, including a flatbed, used to haul lumber, livestock feed and other items. Her sister and partner live on similar property and have similar needs to haul materials and livestock feed, we help them out frequently and they do similar for us. They also own a flatbed trailer, similar to ours, they bought about a year ago. 

During that time, they did not register the trailer and therefore did not use it. Instead they occasionally, maybe once or twice a month, asked to use ours. This wasn't an issue for the first 7-8 times, as I know it's not ideal to visit the DMV and a bit of a hassle and they are busy up keeping their property. However, after continued asks and occasionally having to retrieve my trailer from their house after use, I asked my partner if there was any reason they kept using our trailer instead of their own. She responded that they hadn't yet made time to license it, but that they had discussed it.

After two more repeated asks to use our trailer, I suggested that I was going to speak with them directly and relay that it would help me if they could license their own trailer unless there was an issue with it that I was not aware of. My partner did not agree with this approach and also did not want to address it directly. I decided to politely bring it up with them and kindly note that this was not an indication that I wasn't willing to help them in the future, but rather I was a bit frustrated with this particular circumstance because I was responsible for the upkeep of my trailer and wasn't understanding why they were not using their own after about a year.

Subsequently, they are very hurt by this interaction and don't think it was appropriate to address it in the manner I did. I told them I understand their perspective but was trying not to let my unheard frustration grow into resentment. Additionally, I discussed this situation with my partner and her sister's father (61M) and his ultimate suggestion was that I should have instead just changed my feelings and not addressed the situation directly.

so i‚Äôm listening to this story, meanwhile being 2 yrs sober myself, getting all upset and interrupt her saying ‚Äúi cant listen to this anymore. this isnt some cool story, you are way too old to be making choices like that still‚Äù and she got incredibly mad, said she obviously knows and regrets it and that im always just judging her cuz im biased for being sober. and that she is grown and can make whatever decisions,and doesnt need me to tell her. it got kinda heated w a back and forth, w me telling her this was a result of her drinking, and was super awkward after so i just went home.

191,1e4fi8j,AITA for taking the smaller room?,"My (19F) family is moving to a new house. It‚Äôs a three bedroom‚Äîso my mom and dad is taking one bedroom, which leaves me and my two sisters(12F and 23F).

The set up is my two sisters share the biggest room in the house, and I take the smallest room; my oldest sister very upset. She says deserves to have this small room.

Here reasons why I think I deserve the room:
1. I helped my parents for the past 2 years with the process. I spent hours of my days helping submit documents and speaking to the mortgage agents(my parents are not tech savvy and English is not their first language). My sister refused in any way to help, and since I helped with this entire process, my parents are leaning torwards me getting the room.  

2. My sister own ALOT of things. We currently share a room right now, and she own the entire closet with her clothes. She has 85% of our large vanity with her jewelry and makeup. She has entire file cabinet with makeup. She has two shoe shelf‚Äôs with all her shoes. She has a queens bed with more shoes and clothes underneath. She has an entire dresser of clothes. She also forced me to give up my drawer underneath my bed to put more of her clothes. 

Thankfully we have a very big room in our current apartment, but if she were to have the small room, Barely anything will fit there. She would wiggle her way into putting her stuff in the big room if I were to hypothetically share with my little sister. So why not have the big room and save the trouble of having your things in two different rooms? And also I am already sick of having to make space for her, so having the smaller room will negate any chance of her stuff being in my room.

3. She will be getting married within 2-3 years, so why snag the smaller room when you will be moving out anyways? I‚Äôm in college right now, and had to make the sacrifice of dorming to stay with my parents because they are getting older. I just want to be able to have my own space to make up for the fact that I am missing the traditional college experience. 

Here are the reasons why she deserves the small room:

1. She‚Äôs older

2. She also has spent her life sharing a room, so she also may want to have the same experience of having her own space.

3. She does hybrid work‚Äîso two times out of the week she is at home with meetings, and she needs the space to do her WFH.

4. My litter sister is a nuisance(she is extremely quiet and keeps to herself) and she does not want to share a room with a child. 

I told my older sister that during the entire day, everyday, that my little sister can come chill with me in my room and she can come to the big room when it‚Äôs bedtime. But she countered that with ‚Äúthen why don‚Äôt you just share the room with her then?‚Äù, which is a fair rebuttal. 

This post is already pretty long so I‚Äôll leave it at that but will provide any more information in the comments. So Reddit, AITA?

I told my older sister that during the entire day, everyday, that my little sister can come chill with me in my room and she can come to the big room when it‚Äôs bedtime. But she countered that with ‚Äúthen why don‚Äôt you just share the room with her then?‚Äù, which is a fair rebuttal. 

This post is already pretty long so I‚Äôll leave it at that but will provide any more information in the comments. So Reddit, AITA?

193,1e4fdaj,AITA if i text my ex-gf that she leads people on?,"AITA if I tell my ex-girlfriend she leads people on and that she shouldn‚Äôt fall in love ever again?

I (F18) had dated this girl, let‚Äôs call her Stacy, in my senior year of high school when I was 17 and Stacy was in her junior year, 16 at the time. We had known each other for a short period of time, although she had already begun to leave snacks at my desk in my AP Calc class before classes started. One day, our friend group and I were off-campus for lunch. It was me, Stacy, Ali, and Didi. Ali and Didi had gotten up to go order our lunch for us, and Stacy told me she had to tell me something. She handed me one of those mini M&M bottles with a love letter in it, which she told me to read once I was home.

Once I was home, I read the note and texted her saying I accepted her love confession. However, Stacy and I only knew each other for a short period of time, so I broke up with her two weeks later and told her I wanted to wait until we got to know each other better. Stacy and I were on good terms for the most part, and this was near the end of the school year. Once I was in my freshman year of college, I still kept in touch with them, as I was attending a college in-state. I found out that Stacy got with Didi shortly after we broke up, which confused me a bit, as I thought she still had feelings for me. I attended my younger brother‚Äôs basketball game, where my friend Ali happened to be as well. We ended up talking, and she told me that she was on a call with Stacy once, and she was saying how Stacy was still hung up on me, and she constantly ghosted Didi as she was just using her as a means to get over me.

I told Didi about this, and also how Stacy had attempted to cheat on her so she would break up with her. They ended up breaking up shortly after. Stacy and I were still on good terms until I started realizing that I was gaining feelings for her again. We had started texting each other more on Instagram, and it would be an understatement to say she was flirting with me. She‚Äôd constantly make flirtatious comments and start reposting videos that were aimed towards me.

Not too long ago, I asked her if she had feelings for me recently, to which she responded by saying that she hasn‚Äôt had feelings for me since my senior year. Mind you, I‚Äôm going into my sophomore year of college. She said that she was scared to tell me because I‚Äôd think she was leading me on.

194,1e4f5dn,AITA for telling my wife no?,"Recently, I (36M) have grown increasingly concerned about my wife's (28F) relationship with her male friend, who is nearly my age.

A bit of background: my wife and I have been together for 4 years, married for 2. I trust her completely, but something about her friendship with this man, whom she met while bartending, is bothering me. He was a regular patron at her bar. He has a bad-boy image and constantly gets into trouble with girls, uses drugs like cocaine, mushrooms, and ecstasy, and has a troubled past, including a felony conviction of domestic abuse and losing custody of his child.

What really concerns me is the way they look at each other. It's a look that suggests an emotional connection. She doesn't look at anyone else like that, except me. IYKYK the look. Sometimes, it feels like I'm watching a couple, and I'm just a cuck.

I've talked to her about this, and she insists she has no feelings for him. But I can't shake the feeling that there's something more. It's been eating at me for a while.

Once, he brought cocaine to our annual Halloween party. While I was engaged in conversations with others, my wife and he, along with some others, did a few lines of coke. I'm not a fan of drugs other than pot, and my wife knows this. She snuck behind my back to do it, and I noticed the change in their behavior immediately. When I confronted her, she admitted to it. It wasn't the cocaine that bothered me as much as the sneaking around behind my back.

Another incident happened when she was bartending late one night. He was there after closing, and I was texting her but got no response. My mother-in-law went to check on her and found them inside. She had to knock on the window for a while before my wife came out. In her defense, my wife often has someone with her for safety when closing up, which I support. But the lack of response and the odd way she answered the door really shook me. She said they were talking about his drama with his dad. I've never caught my wife in a lie, although I've seen her lie to others very convincingly, making it hard to discern.

Now, she's talking about this guy moving in with us temporarily to help with house projects. I work 10-hour shifts, and she doesn't work, so they would be alone together at home for about 12 hours each day. While I trust her, I feel uncomfortable about their dynamic and have learned to trust my gut instincts.

If she had cheated with him that night at the bar, I would forgive her-it was early in our relationship. I feel no lack of love from her; nothing has changed, no distance has developed between us. However, my instincts are on high alert. I'm not the type to say ""no, you can't do that"" or ""| don't like him as your friend,"" but I feel uneasy. I have not done this with any other friends of hers, including her ex-husband.

196,1e4ev4t,AITA Want Boyfriend to Ask,"My boyfriend and I have got into a fight over this same trivial situation in the past. It‚Äôs dumb but also he refuses to apologize and it keeps escalating. 

 What happens is that I will be watching the TV and something will come up where I have to pause my show and walk away to do a task. (This time - I brought the dog out on the porch to to cool her down with the hose). The living room is on the same level and close to the porch. While I am away my boyfriend will sit down and just take the TV and change the channel. 

I asked him last few times to please just ask me if I am done watching whatever I am watching before just changing the channel. I am literally a few meters away. He knew I was watching something while he was serving himself dinner. And then when I paused it and went outside - he sat down and immediately changed it. 

I came in and said ‚Äúhey - I was watching something. I would had appreciated if you just asked me if I was done or if you could change the channel‚Äù

He immediately got defensive, said it‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt intentional and why couldn‚Äôt I just ask HIM to change it back? He said - so every time I come in here I have to ask you? You had left!?! And he said I came in here and was saying this just to start a fight. And now he is going to always leave the TV on so I always have to ask him. 

I got upset then more so because this showed me he still didn‚Äôt respect my view from the last time we got in a fight over the same thing and I asked him this. He didn‚Äôt feel sorry for crossing a boundary. He continued to feel righteous and then put it on me that I was ‚Äújust trying to start a fight‚Äù.  (Yes - because I just love fighting üòí)

I said I was upset because he obviously doesn‚Äôt respect or value my side of this argument enough to been considerate and to just ask me before taking over the television.  Since this is now happened multiple times and we have been having this same fight where he says he will try to ask me but still never does.

It is a dumb argument. But what gets under my skin is the fact he just continues to take without asking. And feels privileged to it without having to ask. To me - it‚Äôs just common courtesy. I feel more upset he seems to disregard or not value this is something important to me. Then not feeling sorry and righteous for crossing the boundary I keep drawing is a concern long term. 

I feel like I‚Äôm being an asshole for this being a big deal. But it has built up to it. It makes me think of how inflexible he will be for other bigger issues that show up in our relationship. 

‚Äî‚Äî- update Edit ‚Äî‚Äî-

Thank you for everyone‚Äôs input and advice!! We were able to talk about this and figure out how to communicate about it better in the future. We both were able to apologize and he said he did care and didn‚Äôt want to act disrespectful. 

We both were assholes in ways to each other with how it was handled is what we decided. 

We are in our early 30s and been together for 3 years living together for 2. These things do add up over time and we are realizing we have differences in ways we grew up and how we can communicate to each other going forward. We also can both be very stubborn when admitting our shortcomings. So progress - not perfection.

He wasn‚Äôt keeping a job because of his drinking. He gets govt support but not much. We were in a position to help keep a roof over his head and food in his belly. It was made clear that we were not the landlords, and all upkeep would be his responsibility. All we asked is he not smoke in the unit, which he ignored. An inspection was completed, everything was up to code, no concerns and we all agreed to proceed. We supplemented around 200 a month to help him. His cost has always been $400.

I do not know her financial details. They pay on time and haven't asked for much over the last 6 ish years. 

This unit has always been a major source of stress in my marriage. My husband has wanted to sell it for years mostly because of the way my dad treats me/us when he‚Äôs been drinking.

199,1e4eg40,AITA for opting to stay home and work instead of going on a family vacation?,"I (17F) come from a pretty close family. We all live in the same city and we make a point to have an all-family meal at least once a week. Every year we stay at my grandpa's cabin in another state for about a week or so and perform normal cabin activities (campfires, paddleboarding, fishing, etc.) I really enjoyed these trips as a kid, but now that I am in high school I find myself growing frustrated with them as they interfere with my sports schedule and hanging out with my friends (normal teenager stuff I realize this mindset kind of makes me TA).

200,1e4efe6,AITA for not giving financial support to a friend in a really bad spot?,"The backstory: I have a friend who used to be very close. She went through a messy divorce and we lived through a lot of dating trauma together.

A few years ago, I got married and now have a young child. My priorities shifted, and I did not have as much time to spend with my friend any more. That coincided with my friend going through some significant struggles, and I began to sense that she felt like I abandoned her. In truth, I'm sure I could have tried harder, but I was overwhelmed with having a newborn and trying to navigate the changes in my life.

More context about my friend - I've always felt that she was not careful with her finances. Even when we were both in the dating world, she used to tell me that she would never date someone who made less than $75k/year, because there's no way to live on less. Up until fairly recently in my own career, I've always made significantly less than that, but carried multiple jobs, budgeted, etc.

Fast forward, and it's been over a year since my friend was really willing to talk to me. She moved a few hours away, so I would try catching up with her over text, but she would give what I read to be very terse replies. Out of the blue, she sends me a text and says she needs help. She launched her own business, but it hasn't taken off as expected. It turns out that she's wildly in debt, has spent probably a few hundred thousand dollars over the course of several years (inheritance, divorce settlement, several other windfalls), has maxed out credit cards, and has only a few hundred dollars left. She has no job (she had one, but quit it after a few weeks because it was only about 35k salary).

She initially said she did not call to ask for money, but any suggestion I had for making a plan was dismissed for one reason or another. She got frustrated when I asked what she had spent all her cash reserves on, but she later told me she had a few elective surgeries that insurance would not cover, she rented an apartment on the beach, she bought a purebred dog... the list goes on and on.

I spoke to my husband, and my first thought was to write a check to at least prevent her from being evicted this month. She has always been a generous friend - she hosted a baby shower for us, gave us an extravagant wedding gift, etc. But my husband pointed out that giving her money is not going to solve any of her problems - she still has no job and no plan.

Ultimately, I did not give my friend money. I did offer to let her stay with us if she got evicted. I also told her that we have an apartment she could live in for free (my husband owns rental properties). She did not want either of those things, and she said she would figure everything out on her own.

He said ""you've been saying you wanted to go to the beach and asking me a few times when we were going, so I want you to know I heard you and I paid for it."" 

When he shared that his son would be going, I expressed my concern about the sleeping arrangements since it was a studio unit.

That made me feel a lot better because I can enjoy some privacy. I repeatedly asked him to check in with her to see if she was able to get it done, but I don't think he ever did.

I agreed with hardware she picked (pack of ten knobs) and sent her some wallpaper that would be beautiful to line the drawers. Once completed, she brought the dresser to our house and it was lovely.

Honestly, if she had told me there was damage BEFORE she started working on it, I would have asked her to continue her search for a dresser. Also, the aplique started dripping a foul smelling liquid that I wiped up and hoped my husband wouldn‚Äôt see. I have been very kind to her throughout this process. 

I sent her a text letting her know about the drawers and how we were going to have to replace them and asked her If she had an idea for a solution. I mentioned how much it would cost to replace ($160) and asked if she would be interested in possibly offsetting some of the costs (I did not tell her to send this exact amount).

I have nothing against it-she‚Äôs a single & has no commitments,doing exactly what‚Äôs she‚Äôs supposed to at this age-I just didn‚Äôt think she was fit to be a godmom. 

When my grandma told my sister, making the decision for me and husband I was upset. I didn‚Äôt stay mad for long bc she is old dated, wanted to keep in the family, it‚Äôs my sister & the way it‚Äôs supposed to be.This was a tough position cause I didn‚Äôt want to disappoint my grandma- I also didn‚Äôt want to disappoint myself & stay with the choice. Plus she already told my sister and from what I heard my sister got very excited. 

At that time I didn‚Äôt personally speak to my sister nor my best friend as it was too early.
A few months passed and I got to see my sister watch & be with my son a few times.She really loved him- I mean he‚Äôs a cute baby.She would change his diapers,give him bottles-all the other stuff. 
The one thing I didn‚Äôt like was that she would show him YouTube videos at like 4 mo. to entertain him. I told her about it a few times &she toned it down. 

Overall, I started thinking that maybe it wasn‚Äôt so bad-her being a godmom. After some time I asked her if she would & she said yes. 
She didn‚Äôt have confirmation sacrament which is needed to officially be a godmother as per catholic law but she said she‚Äôd take care of it. 

We settled a date for christening- she had 6 months to give the paperwork to church.
As we were getting closer to the date I would periodically remind her and she‚Äôd always have the same answer- ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm taking care of it‚Äù. But now we are 2 weeks away, the priest is asking me for documents like crazy, and for the last month I have been trying to reach her with no response. I‚Äôve called. Messaged her through social media as well.  My brother, mom, grandma have tried talking to her and she‚Äôs giving them some oblivious answers. 

She hasn‚Äôt replied to any of my messages but I see she received those. She posts instagram stories of her going out etc so I see she‚Äôs up and about. 

Now my family is getting really upset at her behaviour. It‚Äôs creating a divide over the christening. 
Turns out my sister never took care of the confirmation sacrament & officially can‚Äôt be a godmom. She could be a witness & act like a godmother but she doesn‚Äôt even respond to that.

Right after my son was born,my husband and I decided to christen him at my hometown. When I told my grandma,she went behind my back & told my sister she is a godmom.

I asked C about what happened and she told me J had backed into it with his trailer at one point. I moved in and asked this question over a year ago. The fence has been broken about two years apparently. 

Today, J sent us a group message saying it would he 300 to fix the fence. When I asked him what exactly happened to the fence, he said it was deteriorating and a storm blew down most of it. He the said he hit it with his truck at one point, but it was mostly the storm. C says that is not true. 

I feel like an asshole for telling him I'm not going to pay. I didn't even live here when it happened! Even if it was a storm would I be responsible at all? I don't know what to do.

209,1e4cj8y,AITA for shaving my mom‚Äôs elderly dog? ,"This past weekend, I shaved my mom‚Äôs 14 year old maltipoo pretty much down to the skin on 90% of her body. 
 
I‚Äôll admit, she looks pretty ugly and cold, and it was quite extreme. 

In my defense, she was matted on large parts of her body and had breakouts of yeast / blistering from the matts. She was so sensitive I could not use a guard, and had to free hand everything. 

I feel much better about her health now that the mats have been removed and I soaked her in anti fungal soap for 10 minutes to reduce the yeast breakouts. 

Before anyone says anything about animal abuse, yes, she was abused by my dad before my parents divorced. She is extremely distrustful of most people, and has never been professionally groomed, which is why I have done my best the past few years. 

I shaved her because I got so frustrated with not being able to give her proper haircuts due to her freaking out, and after starting to shave her I saw why, the blistering and skin issues! 

After researching more on grooming sites how to handle the extreme matting, they all seemed to agree that shaving was the only way. 

Both my mom and grandma are upset with how she looks though.

Before living here we did live in a more affordable income based home which has a long wait list btw.
We wanted me more space so me, my mom, and my sister decided to move to our current house and split the rent three ways. Long story short my sister ended up getting addicted to drugs and leaving.
Due to all the toxic behavior in the house from my sister doing drugs my mom moved in with her boyfriend in his 1 bed room apartment but still she pays her half of the rent. So that leaves me and my 2 brothers here (19 and in trade school currently) and (18 still in high school because he barely even shows up to school) I don't hate my family but I honestly am ready to live on my own and have my own space. Also because due to my sister leaving me and my mother can barely afford the rent between us two. The house honestly needs a lot of repairs that makes it harder for living like a broken washer machine ,constant power outages etc.
Which honestly makes me really don't want to live here anymore. But when I complain about it my mom just makes it seem like l'm being dramatic. But like I said before she doesn't live here she lives with her boyfriend. So I try to convince my mom to just let the house go but she goes "" I can't afford to get a place on my own with just my income. Where will your brothers stay?"" I don't want to be a selfish daughter/sister and I don't want to see my brothers with no where to go. But I just honestly can't mentally live at home anymore.

Now my sister is mad and butt hurt that no one thinks about her or has any appreciation that she did already share all the other capri suns

my brother (16M) currently has an iphone 14 plus, and used to have an old iphone 10 that is in very bad shape; as in the screen is peeling off, it doesnt charge right,  and the second u turn ut on, the right side starts overheating. i like the quality of the selfies that i take on that phone, they're not too pixelated and they're not too HD. 

My brother hasnt touched thid phone in over 2 years. I noticed it on his TV unit last night and asked if i could take it. he assumed it didnt work at all and that i couldnt get it to unlock, but to his surprise i managed to unlock it when i charged it. He then randomly decides that he wants to keep it  and takes it away from me. i ask him why he suddenly wants to keep it and he says it would be nice to have an extra phone. i asked him why and to give me just one reason for why he would want it. we argued over it for an hour and he couldnt think of one. 

For the record, when my brother was using the iphone 10, he would constantly get angry at how slow it was and would throw it; resulting in ut being mote damaged. all he did was complain about how slow it was until we got him a new one.

213,1e4c3s2,AITA for running late to pick up a friend from the airport?,"This just happened so I‚Äôm still feeling really confused and guilty and upset. I‚Äôm just looking for some outside perspectives. 

A couple days ago I confirmed with my best friend that I *could* pick her up from the airport. I dropped her off at the airport but was unsure if I could pick her up. I confirmed I could a few days ago and she sent me a screenshot of her ticket so I would know when to pick her up. I‚Äôm an idiot because I didn‚Äôt even think to use her ticket to track the flight. 

She was supposed to land at 4:15 so I had planned to pick her up around 4:45 so that she would have time to get off the plane and get to the terminal. I was in the middle of reading when I realized it was 3:45 and that I needed to go. I tried to get dressed quickly but I had some weird executive dysfunction and it took me longer than normal to get my stuff together and leave. I was checking our texts to see if my messages had delivered and was basing my timing off of that. I assumed since her phone was still on airplane mode that meant she was still on the plane. I left around 4 to LAX to get her and then on the freeway realized I did not lock my door and I got paranoid and turned around since I was still close to my house and locked the door. When I got back in the car she had messaged me. We both share our locations and she checked mine and saw that I was still home. I apologized profusely and was already back on my way. 

It was already going to take an hour to get there and she said it was going to take her 20 minutes to get to the exit and that she was just going to take an uber. I told her I was on my way. She would have to wait 45 minutes but I was still going to be there and I was going to offer to get her food on the way back to apologize. She said she didn‚Äôt want to wait at the airport at all and that she‚Äôs getting an uber her step dad paid for. I apologized again and she texted me ‚Äúthis is really fucked up dude. we‚Äôll talk more later‚Äù as I am still heading towards LAX so I got off the freeway and just replied ok.I know I should have been more on top of her arrival time and I feel so dumb for not tracking the flight and making time assumptions about getting to LAX. 

But this feels like a big overreaction on her part. Getting from my place to LAX takes 45 minutes on a good day but can take like an hour and a half on a day like today. Then it would take 2 hours or more to get her back to her place due to the rush hour traffic and I was 100% willing to do all of this. 

I‚Äôm hurt by her reaction as this is a favor I agreed to do because she‚Äôs my best friend but she was so quick to be so incredibly angry with me. If the roles were reversed I would be frustrated but ultimately I would have waited. She did not have to wait for me if given the option not to, which she was and she took. I feel like she is overreacting a bit here by telling me that I did something heinous.

So my parents and I were out to dinner tonight, and when our food came my dad took his fork and took some of my food. I get uncomfortable and angry when people take my food without asking, so I took my fork to get revenge on his plate. He started to block my fork from his food, but I got a piece and he got really mad. He said ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your deal, you didn‚Äôt have to make a scene about it‚Äù (I‚Äôm assuming he said that because the clanking forks were loud but whatever). Now, I‚Äôm 17 and I feel like I can push back a little bit more than I used to on trivial things like this, so I said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like people taking my food without asking, I would‚Äôve let you have some if you asked‚Äù. My dad replied to this by saying ‚Äúwhen I was a kid, my parents did that to me every meal, and if I pushed back I would sit in the car without a meal‚Äù. I rolled my eyes a little bit and said ‚Äúok, well I‚Äôm not you, and you‚Äôre not your dad. I asked you nicely and just ask that you ask next time‚Äù. My other dad looks at me and says ‚Äúok, you don‚Äôt have to be a dick‚Äù, which I reply by saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not being a dick, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a crazy thing to ask‚Äù. 

That‚Äôs the situation, the reason I posted this story was because my dad doesn‚Äôt often say I‚Äôm being a dick, so I thought there was a chance I could‚Äôve been without realizing, but I don‚Äôt think I was. So, AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-16,"AITA for pushing back in my parents during dinner? Okay, this situation is pretty trivial, but I still wanted to post it because I think I‚Äôm right.

So my parents and I were out to dinner tonight, and when our food came my dad took his fork and took some of my food. I get uncomfortable and angry when people take my food without asking, so I took my fork to get revenge on his plate. He started to block my fork from his food, but I got a piece and he got really mad. He said ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your deal, you didn‚Äôt have to make a scene about it‚Äù (I‚Äôm assuming he said that because the clanking forks were loud but whatever). Now, I‚Äôm 17 and I feel like I can push back a little bit more than I used to on trivial things like this, so I said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like people taking my food without asking, I would‚Äôve let you have some if you asked‚Äù. My dad replied to this by saying ‚Äúwhen I was a kid, my parents did that to me every meal, and if I pushed back I would sit in the car without a meal‚Äù. I rolled my eyes a little bit and said ‚Äúok, well I‚Äôm not you, and you‚Äôre not your dad. I asked you nicely and just ask that you ask next time‚Äù.

215,1e4c216,AITA for keeping a job that makes my girlfriend uncomfortable?,"I'm a college student. Last year, I briefly dated a girl I had some mutual friends with. After we broke up, we still saw each other occasionally and were friendly/corsial. In one such case, I mentioned to her that I was looking for a paid internship in my field. I didn't strictly need money since my parents pay for my college, but I would feel bad asking for them for extra money to spend on nights out with friends, gas, clothing, etc, and getting some experiences in my field would help my resume. 

Coincidentally, she happened to have lots of family that worked in the same field, and she asked if I wanted her to connect me to some opportunities. I agreed, and I got a pretty well-paid position. 

I've been dating my current girlfriend for 6 months, and she says it bothers her that I'm working a job that I got because of a past girlfriend, especially since I don't need a job. I pointed out this girl and I dated for a month and broke things off because both of us agreed that it wasn't working and we were better as friends, so she has nothing to worry about, but she thinks I should quit and find an internship elsewhere.

AITA for telling her no? ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-16,"AITA for keeping a job that makes my girlfriend uncomfortable? I'm a college student.

216,1e4bzr6,AITA for not defending my BF when people talk shit?,"I (F20) and my boyfriend (M19) have been dating for 6 years, we got together in our freshmen year. he got upset with me out of nowhere for not defending him when people talk shit about him. At first, I had no idea what he was talking about and tried to find out if someone had said something in one of our group chats but couldn't find anything. I finally asked him what he was talking about and he wouldn't say at first, just saying he could think of three specific times and I had to ask again before he told me.

the first time he's talking about was in our first year of dating on our 5th or 6th date my mom was taking us to the park because neither of us knew how to drive. He said something offhand about being autistic to which my mom said why do we attract the special ones I replied because we are special too. I know how being called special can be considered a slur in that type of situation but my mother didn't mean it in a bad way and after he told me he didn't like being called special I told my mom not to do it again.

The next time he's talking about was last year. I sent a picture of us to my sibling who showed her than SO and her SO remarked on how tight his pants were. He was reading my texts over my shoulder which I didn't mind. I thought I defended him by saying his parent were a couple of years old and he likes them because they're comfortable and he was wearing them because we didn't have any plans on leaving the house.

the third time I have no memory of but he said me and his sister were talking about how I was bi and how she thought that I liked girls more, I'm not counting it as a time tho cause I think its bs.

so AITA for ""Not defending him."" I thought I did by telling my mom not to say that again and by explaining why he was wearing the pants but I'm not sure.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-16,"AITA for not defending my BF when people talk shit?
