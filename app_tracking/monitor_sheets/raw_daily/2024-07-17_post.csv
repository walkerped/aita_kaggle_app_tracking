0,1e56ddp,UPDATE: AITA for blowing up at my wife over my daughter's school picture?,"Original Post: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1da7sw7/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_wife_over_my_daughters/)

First of all, I'd like to thank everyone for their generous comments and advice. As promised, here is the update.

After my wife left for work, I decided to check up on my daughter. She was in her room doing homework and I could tell by the forced expression that she was not okay.

As she talked, everything began to make sense. My daughter overheard her mother shaming her in front of the other church moms. She heard them boasting about their kids and her mother would use ""condescending modesty"" e.g ""She's gained weight and she doesn't even study hard"". She was tired of trying to surpass my wife's expectations. She couldn't stand it when my wife was in the house. She asked me ""Why am I her diamond? She cuts me to make me ""shine"". How more of this should I take?""

I prepared her all the foods I promised to make and she was hesitant but ate a lot more than when my wife was around. She wanted to further talk with me.I then asked if she wanted me to tell my wife how she felt. Hayoung said ""it was the only way to get her to listen"", before telling me she wants me to get a divorce. I asked her if she was absolutely sure, as it was something very serious. She said she was fine with it. I'm just devastated it has reached this point.

When Hayoung was at school, I had a conversation with my wife. I brought up Hayoung's concerns, along with mine. I asked my wife what made her put down my daughter on the day of the school picture incident. She made excuses such as having bad days, hence she'd ""accidentally"" release her anger and other emotions by yelling, the silent treatment etc. I questioned further if there was anything in the past that was bothering her, which she replied snarkily, ""Nothing is bothering me. I raised her into a better person. If you have problems with how I'm raising her, she's all yours. I don't want to argue anymore, especially with a sensitive lazy person like you.""

We had a lot of arguments in the past on raising Hayoung. This phrase was used in all of our arguments to shut me up. As Hayoung was consistently used as an emotional punching bag and a trophy for my wife, this was the last straw. I told my wife ""We were done"", then told her to pack up and leave.I ""thanked"" her for letting me realise my self worth. After some time had passed, she had driven to her parents' house and was staying there for a bit.

When Hayoung came back, she noticed her mom's room was a lot barer than it was and knew what had happened. I hugged Hayoung and told her I was sorry for the mess I had caused, before reassuring her that nothing was her fault. I told her my ex wife would come back a few more times to collect the rest of her stuff, but our relationship was over.

This event shook me up a lot, but I know things will get better. I'm trying to make Hayoung always feel loved. Hayoung, you are my universe and that will never change.",UPDATE,2024-07-17,"UPDATE: AITA for blowing up at my wife over my daughter's school picture?

1,1e559u9,AITA for asking my dad to prioritize me over my mom,"My mother is quite emotionally abusive and has been my whole life. She has not spoken to me for over two years and I have been in therapy for the same length of time. To my mothers dismay, my dad and I have a strong relationship and we make time to see each other separately, which she often tries to sabotage/complicate. My parents went to therapy because he has started standing up to her and disapproving of how she treats me and others. He never used to do this and was quite a passive parent, so she has not been dealing well with the pushback/powershift and I am getting the blame. Especially since he is now carving out small chunks of time on holidays to see me, instead of spending the whole time with my mom and sister.  My father is also abused by her, and me stepping away has empowered him to start doing the same in his own way. They have discussed divorce, but I don’t think he will ever fully leave her which I have accepted since he needs to make that decision on his own and for himself.  Despite all the progress he has made, he still understandably gets caught up in trying to fix the marriage and please my mother. I live out of town (an hour away) and don’t come there often since we usually meet somewhere in the middle of where we both live. I told him I am coming to town this weekend and if he would be free for a bit for a walk or coffee. He was going back and forth and hesitating to give me an answer before he explained that Saturdays are the “official days” he spends with my mom. I’m assuming this is something new they implemented from their couples therapy but i’m not sure. After I hung up the phone I’m realizing im pretty upset that he is prioritizing this over me. To be clear, I wholeheartedly believe you have to prioritize your partner in a marriage, but I also think in a healthy relationship you would prioritize seeing your child when they are only in your city once every couple of months. My parents live together and have nothing specific scheduled or planned for Saturday, he is just supposed to reserve every Saturday indefinitely.  Given they are retired, this also sucks because I work and this means the only time I can see my dad moving forward is on Sundays. Am I the asshole for telling my dad im upset he isnt carving out any time to see me?

2,1e552av,WIBTA if I confronted my friend about her mental disorders,"I (18F) have a friend (17F) who I grew up with since I was 9 years old. Growing up we were practically glued together as our families were friends, and we had sleepovers very often. Throughout our childhood I would like to say she seemed pretty neurotypical, as no behaviour indicated anything else.

Now before I continue I'd like to clarify that my intentions are not to invalidate her in any form. I believe mental illness is something that should not be taken lightly, therefore the reason why I am making this post.

Ever since the covid pandemic, my friend had stopped attending school and her behaviour started to change. She became more sensitive and it reflected onto our mutual friends. Often she would tell me she had ended relationships due to small conflicts or disagreements. At this time, my friend is practically living on the internet. Her mom begged her to go to school but she refused. I was very concerned with her behaviour and life habits, but I thought maybe she was just transitioning from a child to an teenager and this was normal.

This was until one day she told me she believed she had borderline personality disorder (BPD) and that was the cause of her changing behaviour. I was not new to mental illness as I have many close friends who deal with it. As much as I respect her opinion I told her she should get it diagnosed as it should be looked into as soon as possible. She agreed, but after getting a psychiatrist she was told that she didn't have BPD. That didn't stop her from believing she had it.

Everytime she made a poor decision, sometimes even harmful ones, she would throw it off as a symptom of BPD. I don't like this at all because to me it seems that she is starting to throw this disorder around without proper diagnosis. However I wanted to avoid conflict with her, so I kept my opinions to myself.

That is until now. I have reached my breaking point. Recently she has come up with two more disorders she firmly believes she has. Autism and ADHD. With no diagnosis from her psychiatrist or suggestions that she has it. She is throwing those two disorders out there and telling everyone she's ""pretty sure"" she has it and using it as a shield to avoid accountability of her actions.

I think there may be underlying issues that she needs to figure out with her psychiatrist, but I feel like I should confront her and tell her that she shouldn't claim to have these mental disorders without plausible source. Although I stand on my point, I have a feeling that I am being insensible to her or that it may be too harsh. WIBTA if I confronted her?

4,1e550ql,AITA for telling my mom her disabled dog's aggressiveness is getting out of hand?,"So 3 years ago my mom rescued a Pyrenees sheepdog puppy who later became paralyzed in his hind legs. The cause is still unknown but while he's not able to walk, his state isn't deteriorating either and he can still crawl on the floor.

After trying everything to help him walk again, it's pretty clear that he's showing no signs of recovery and my mom would rather turn a blind eye to the distress he's in. His breed is known for having a dominant streak and introducing him to our 2 other dogs (1 Coton and 1 Tibetan Terrier) has completely changed the dynamic – he wants to be in charge but because he can't, he's turned into a very difficult dog to handle. The slightest movements will drive him into a frenzy and he will obsessively invade our Tibetan's space and try to attack him while barking.

Despite living on my own now, I was against getting a third dog as my mom does not have a good financial situation and our two dogs are getting older. My mom did not listen and failed to discipline our Pyrenees sheepdog consistently. 

I've always had dogs and I love my dogs to death but this is getting too much. I've tried my best to bond with this dog but he became overprotective of my mom and growls at me sometimes when I get a little close. When he's finally nice, he can still attack me out of nowhere. A few weeks ago he bit my face (thankfully not too bad) and my mom told me to keep shut about it, that I misunderstood the dog's behavior, that he didn't mean it and was only afraid... I'm just baffled at this point. It just ""oh, poor Scottie, he's disabled, you should be more understanding, he's just upset because you play favorites and spend more time with the other dogs"".

Frankly, this environment revolving around one spoiled disabled dog with attachment issues is getting too stressful and I fear it's taking a toll on our other dogs with a more docile, sweeter temperament. 

Am I right to find this dynamic abnormal, stressful and even unhealthy? Or AITA for refusing to spend more time than necessary with this dog?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-17,"AITA for telling my mom her disabled dog's aggressiveness is getting out of hand?

5,1e54wrl,AITA for asking my friend about how her behavior changed and she doesn’t let me go in her ohone after SHE DECIDED to disclose private information about her private life to me even though I never asked? ,"This is such a small situation compared to some things in thid sub but I decided to post it anyways.

So I am a dude and I have a close friend who’s about the same age as me and a girl, we both have known each other for a long time and we both became legal adults only a few months apart about a yr ago.

Anyways what we would usually do is that she’ll give me her phone when I see her in the morning and I would use apple pay to go buy her whatever she wanted and bring it back to her whenever I went out to get myself something. A few days ago I had a conversation with her in her room, she told me some personal details about conversations she had over text with her former boyfriend (they just broke up not long ago) and she told me it’s the only thing of his that she hasn’t deleted from her phone, anyways I didn’t think much of it nor do I care, but she knows I had a normal teenage crush on her even way back though I’m long over it at this point. 

The next time I went out to buy things at the store for the first time instead of giving me apple pay on her phone she gave me her full credit card with the 4 digit instead, and later on I was talking to another (male) friend and I told him I don’t mind but I was thinking that maybe she was scared I was gonna snoop and see something I’m not supposed to even though I’ve never broken her trust so she has no reason to believe that. I asked her about it and she said I was overthinking she just wanted to keep her phone, this is how it’s been since. It was just way too convinient of a change, I don’t care about the phone stuff, I’m just thinking that maybe she doesn’t trust me as much as I thought? She has used my phone before and knows my passcode and I trusted her not to look at anything.

6,1e54aet,AITA for Taking My Daughter to See Her Father in a Coma After a Hit-and-Run Accident? ," I (F25) have a complicated relationship with my ex-boyfriend (M28). We have a 7-year-old daughter together, and despite our past issues, we've tried to co-parent as best as we can. Recently, he was involved in a terrible hit-and-run accident that left him in a coma.

When I got the call from the hospital, it was devastating. Despite everything, I knew I had to be there for him, not just for his sake, but also for our daughter's. She adores her father, and I couldn't imagine not letting her see him, especially in such a critical situation.

I decided to take our daughter to the hospital to see him. She was initially scared and confused, seeing her dad hooked up to machines and unconscious. But I held her hand and explained as gently as I could what had happened. I wanted her to understand that her dad was hurt but that the doctors were doing everything they could to help him get better.

For the first few days, we visited regularly. Each time, she would hold his hand or talk to him softly, hoping he could hear her. However, after a few visits, I noticed a change in her behavior. She started crying every day, expressing fear and sadness about her father's condition.

My mother criticized my decision, saying it was too much for a young child to handle. She argued that I should shield her from the harsh reality of seeing her father in that state. Her concerns weighed on me, and after seeing how much it was affecting her, I made the difficult decision to stop taking her to the hospital.

Now, I feel torn and guilty. I only wanted to do what I thought was best for both my daughter and her father, but seeing her emotional distress has made me question my choices.

7,1e549dk,AITA for expecting my cousin to clean more?,"Hi everyone,

My cousin (30M) and I (26F) have been roommates for about 7 months now. He broke up with his long term girlfriend (6 years together) after some things that I don't feel are relevant for this post. This hit him pretty hard (they were engaged), and went through a lot of stuff together; so I offered him to stay on my couch meanwhile he gets everything sorted for a job offer he got overseas. We're practically siblings and I wanted to help him out since he's an only child.

I knew that it was going to be challenging since he's pretty messy, but I was happy to help. Now, it has been definitely challenging since the beginning, so I had a talk with him a few months ago, asking him to help me out more with the cleaning, dishes and cooking, because I was doing all of that by myself, after that it got a little bit better, but after a trip he made, everything went back to square one.

Now, I'm not a neat freak by all means, but I like to leave the kitchen clean by the end of the day, since I can see it from my bedroom and seeing it dirty, stresses me out.

A detail that may be important is that I live in a pretty small studio apartment with one bathroom, so it's a tight fit for 2 people, and I notice any untydiness way easier that if he had his own room.

I also want to mention that I work from home, and only sometimes go out on weekends, so my home is pretty important for me. I also hate to cook, but cook after I finish work, so we can both have lunch ready for the next day, but he rarely cooks, even after we agreed that we would take turns.

Yesterday he was off work, and I was working, so he said that he would cook, but ended up asking me what I wanted him to make for lunch, and I just cracked, I told him ""whatever you want"", and just continued working. I don't know if other women can relate, but having to constantly tell him what to do and how to do it, it's mentally exhausting, and he asks for instructions all the time. If he's rarely making lunch, he asks me what to make, if there's something that obviously needs to be cleaned, I need to ask him or he won't do it.

Today I'll talk to him after he arrives from work, but now I'm wondering, AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-17,"AITA for expecting my cousin to clean more? Hi everyone,

My cousin (30M) and I (26F) have been roommates for about 7 months now. He broke up with his long term girlfriend (6 years together) after some things that I don't feel are relevant for this post. This hit him pretty hard (they were engaged), and went through a lot of stuff together; so I offered him to stay on my couch meanwhile he gets everything sorted for a job offer he got overseas. We're practically siblings and I wanted to help him out since he's an only child.

I knew that it was going to be challenging since he's pretty messy, but I was happy to help. Now, it has been definitely challenging since the beginning, so I had a talk with him a few months ago, asking him to help me out more with the cleaning, dishes and cooking, because I was doing all of that by myself, after that it got a little bit better, but after a trip he made, everything went back to square one.

Now, I'm not a neat freak by all means, but I like to leave the kitchen clean by the end of the day, since I can see it from my bedroom and seeing it dirty, stresses me out.

A detail that may be important is that I live in a pretty small studio apartment with one bathroom, so it's a tight fit for 2 people, and I notice any untydiness way easier that if he had his own room.

I also want to mention that I work from home, and only sometimes go out on weekends, so my home is pretty important for me. I also hate to cook, but cook after I finish work, so we can both have lunch ready for the next day, but he rarely cooks, even after we agreed that we would take turns.

8,1e543gb,"AITA for telling my sister that her in-laws can't come to Thanksgiving at my house, where my mom will meet my fiancé's parents for the first time?","My fiancé (33M) and I (31F) are really close with my immediate family (my sister and my mom). We visit them often across the country, take vacations together, etc. My sister's in-laws are also very present. We've spent lots of holidays with them, vacationed together as a group, etc. Since my sister had her first kid a year and a half ago, we've seen them all even more often than usual. All the while, my fiancé's parents and mine have yet to actually meet. They live far away from each other and varying attitudes about covid precautions made it impractical for us to coordinate a meeting over the last several years. They were actually supposed to meet last Christmas, but then we actually got covid and had to cancel.

Fast forward to now: we had the idea to invite our parents and siblings (and their partners + kids) to our place (a plane ride away for everyone) for Thanksgiving. We're running out of chances to get everyone together before our wedding next spring, so it seems like as good an opportunity as any. Today my sister asked me if her in-laws could come, and I told her that since it's the first time our parents are meeting we don't really think it would be appropriate, so no. I tried to explain it clearly and honestly, but she got angry with me and said ""holidays are supposed to be inclusive"" and if we're not going to invite her in-laws then maybe she (and her husband and kid) will just stay home and spend the holiday with them instead.

9,1e540dl,AITA for altering my late cousins wedding dress to use in my own wedding?,"English is not my first language so i apologize for any spelling or grammar mistakes.

About 6 years ago my (28 F) cousin (29 F), Callie (fake name), moved to the same city as me. We grew extremely close and honestly clicked better than I had with anyone else. She quickly became my best friend. We met up all the time and even introduced me to my fiancé (30 M). When Callie got engaged, she asked me to be her maid of honor, and i accepted. We were both so excited and she involved me in pretty much all the wedding planning. 

When her sister Anna found out that I was the maid of honor instead of her, she was furious. She claimed that Callie was turning her back on her real family and threw a fit. It got to the point where Anna got kicked out of the bridal party and her parents almost boycotted the wedding. Fortunately, aside from a few petty comments from Anna, the wedding went off without a hitch. Shortly after, Callie helped my then boyfriend propose to me. Obviously, I asked Callie to be my maid of honor, and she suggested I also repurpose her wedding dress for mine as my “something borrowed”. Due to some issues with my future FIL’s health, we decided to put off on the wedding, and during that time, Callie got pregnant and asked me and my fiancé to be the baby’s godparents. 

We brainstormed names together, went baby shopping, and i helped put together their nursery. I was so excited when Callie referred to me as her child’s aunt, and I was over the moon to find out she was having twins. I started planning ways to accommodate Callie and her babies for my wedding, as I wouldn’t want to have it without them. But, to make a long story short, Callie passed away during labor, along with one of her twins. I was devastated, but stepped up to plan the funeral and help her husband, who had come to be one of my closest friends, for the months after her death. It was honestly the hardest point in my life, and even a year later i’m struggling to come to term with it all.

A few months ago I came to my cousins husband and asked if I could still repurpose Callie’s wedding dress like she suggested, thinking it would be a good way to honor her and still include her in my wedding, and he was all for it.

The problem came when Anna called me, tearing into me that I’m a horrible person for altering her late sisters wedding dress without consulting her first. I tried to explain my side but she said that I’m a selfish AH for doing this when she deserves her sisters dress more. She claims that because she wasn’t apart of the bridal party, this is her only way to feel connected to her sisters wedding. She made a long post on facebook tearing into me, calling me all sorts of names and claiming that i’m insulting her sister’s memory.

I honestly don’t know what to do, this has torn my family into two sides and it’s been incredibly hard on Callie’s husband.

10,1e53yu9,AITA For not letting my sister have her boyfriend over while she housesits?,"My sister 19 and her boyfriend 19 have been dating for a year and a half. Both of them still live at home with their parents.  She ""watches"" our house for us when we are gone which isn't very often. Like 2x a year. We have a fenced in yard and an amazing dog, that can go in and out as she pleases. So all she has to do is play with her and feed her.

 She is a few years younger than I am, and I'm obviously still figuring out adulthood... I mean who isn't honestly. But there is just a lack of maturity on her part and her boyfriends part. 

In the few times I've met her boyfriend he has managed to cause drama with a family member and agitate a few others with his smart alec comments. I have tried being nice to him and striking conversations multiple times but he always gives 1-2 word answers. Unless it's a sly comment. Another one of my sisters has heard him & his family openly bashing our family to our younger sister over the phone before. And our younger sister didn't say a thing. I know they are young and I know people make mistakes but some of those comments were pretty harsh. However, I still would like to get to know him and build a relationship with him because him and my sister are talking about getting married. (They have been for about 8 months now they are just trying to save money)
 
I want to be supportive no matter what happens. I told my sister I didn't feel comfortable with him coming and hanging out with her a few days, and she threw the ""I'm an adult card"" in my face. I tried to assure her it was because we haven't really hung out with him one on one and really didn't know him that well. After she told her boyfriend he made a few jokes example; it's not like I'm going to wreck their house or yeah because I'm a stranger after 1.5 years.... 

side note, the last time my sister watched my house alone she ruined my new couch with paint.... I also know from my little sister and from the last time they had a day date at my parents house they left the place an absolute mess... both of them are still learning to pick up after themselves. I really don't want to come back after a week away and deep clean my house.
