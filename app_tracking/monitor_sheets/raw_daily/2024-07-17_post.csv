0,1e56ddp,UPDATE: AITA for blowing up at my wife over my daughter's school picture?,"Original Post: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1da7sw7/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_wife_over_my_daughters/)

First of all, I'd like to thank everyone for their generous comments and advice. As promised, here is the update.

After my wife left for work, I decided to check up on my daughter. She was in her room doing homework and I could tell by the forced expression that she was not okay.

As she talked, everything began to make sense. My daughter overheard her mother shaming her in front of the other church moms. She heard them boasting about their kids and her mother would use ""condescending modesty"" e.g ""She's gained weight and she doesn't even study hard"". She was tired of trying to surpass my wife's expectations. She couldn't stand it when my wife was in the house. She asked me ""Why am I her diamond? She cuts me to make me ""shine"". How more of this should I take?""

I prepared her all the foods I promised to make and she was hesitant but ate a lot more than when my wife was around. She wanted to further talk with me.I then asked if she wanted me to tell my wife how she felt. Hayoung said ""it was the only way to get her to listen"", before telling me she wants me to get a divorce. I asked her if she was absolutely sure, as it was something very serious. She said she was fine with it. I'm just devastated it has reached this point.

When Hayoung was at school, I had a conversation with my wife. I brought up Hayoung's concerns, along with mine. I asked my wife what made her put down my daughter on the day of the school picture incident. She made excuses such as having bad days, hence she'd ""accidentally"" release her anger and other emotions by yelling, the silent treatment etc. I questioned further if there was anything in the past that was bothering her, which she replied snarkily, ""Nothing is bothering me. I raised her into a better person. If you have problems with how I'm raising her, she's all yours. I don't want to argue anymore, especially with a sensitive lazy person like you.""

We had a lot of arguments in the past on raising Hayoung. This phrase was used in all of our arguments to shut me up. As Hayoung was consistently used as an emotional punching bag and a trophy for my wife, this was the last straw. I told my wife ""We were done"", then told her to pack up and leave.I ""thanked"" her for letting me realise my self worth. After some time had passed, she had driven to her parents' house and was staying there for a bit.

When Hayoung came back, she noticed her mom's room was a lot barer than it was and knew what had happened. I hugged Hayoung and told her I was sorry for the mess I had caused, before reassuring her that nothing was her fault. I told her my ex wife would come back a few more times to collect the rest of her stuff, but our relationship was over.

This event shook me up a lot, but I know things will get better. I'm trying to make Hayoung always feel loved. Hayoung, you are my universe and that will never change.",UPDATE,2024-07-17,"UPDATE: AITA for blowing up at my wife over my daughter's school picture?

1,1e559u9,AITA for asking my dad to prioritize me over my mom,"My mother is quite emotionally abusive and has been my whole life. She has not spoken to me for over two years and I have been in therapy for the same length of time. To my mothers dismay, my dad and I have a strong relationship and we make time to see each other separately, which she often tries to sabotage/complicate. My parents went to therapy because he has started standing up to her and disapproving of how she treats me and others. He never used to do this and was quite a passive parent, so she has not been dealing well with the pushback/powershift and I am getting the blame. Especially since he is now carving out small chunks of time on holidays to see me, instead of spending the whole time with my mom and sister.  My father is also abused by her, and me stepping away has empowered him to start doing the same in his own way. They have discussed divorce, but I don’t think he will ever fully leave her which I have accepted since he needs to make that decision on his own and for himself.  Despite all the progress he has made, he still understandably gets caught up in trying to fix the marriage and please my mother. I live out of town (an hour away) and don’t come there often since we usually meet somewhere in the middle of where we both live. I told him I am coming to town this weekend and if he would be free for a bit for a walk or coffee. He was going back and forth and hesitating to give me an answer before he explained that Saturdays are the “official days” he spends with my mom. I’m assuming this is something new they implemented from their couples therapy but i’m not sure. After I hung up the phone I’m realizing im pretty upset that he is prioritizing this over me. To be clear, I wholeheartedly believe you have to prioritize your partner in a marriage, but I also think in a healthy relationship you would prioritize seeing your child when they are only in your city once every couple of months. My parents live together and have nothing specific scheduled or planned for Saturday, he is just supposed to reserve every Saturday indefinitely.  Given they are retired, this also sucks because I work and this means the only time I can see my dad moving forward is on Sundays. Am I the asshole for telling my dad im upset he isnt carving out any time to see me?

2,1e552av,WIBTA if I confronted my friend about her mental disorders,"I (18F) have a friend (17F) who I grew up with since I was 9 years old. Growing up we were practically glued together as our families were friends, and we had sleepovers very often. Throughout our childhood I would like to say she seemed pretty neurotypical, as no behaviour indicated anything else.

Now before I continue I'd like to clarify that my intentions are not to invalidate her in any form. I believe mental illness is something that should not be taken lightly, therefore the reason why I am making this post.

Ever since the covid pandemic, my friend had stopped attending school and her behaviour started to change. She became more sensitive and it reflected onto our mutual friends. Often she would tell me she had ended relationships due to small conflicts or disagreements. At this time, my friend is practically living on the internet. Her mom begged her to go to school but she refused. I was very concerned with her behaviour and life habits, but I thought maybe she was just transitioning from a child to an teenager and this was normal.

This was until one day she told me she believed she had borderline personality disorder (BPD) and that was the cause of her changing behaviour. I was not new to mental illness as I have many close friends who deal with it. As much as I respect her opinion I told her she should get it diagnosed as it should be looked into as soon as possible. She agreed, but after getting a psychiatrist she was told that she didn't have BPD. That didn't stop her from believing she had it.

Everytime she made a poor decision, sometimes even harmful ones, she would throw it off as a symptom of BPD. I don't like this at all because to me it seems that she is starting to throw this disorder around without proper diagnosis. However I wanted to avoid conflict with her, so I kept my opinions to myself.

That is until now. I have reached my breaking point. Recently she has come up with two more disorders she firmly believes she has. Autism and ADHD. With no diagnosis from her psychiatrist or suggestions that she has it. She is throwing those two disorders out there and telling everyone she's ""pretty sure"" she has it and using it as a shield to avoid accountability of her actions.

I think there may be underlying issues that she needs to figure out with her psychiatrist, but I feel like I should confront her and tell her that she shouldn't claim to have these mental disorders without plausible source. Although I stand on my point, I have a feeling that I am being insensible to her or that it may be too harsh. WIBTA if I confronted her?

4,1e550ql,AITA for telling my mom her disabled dog's aggressiveness is getting out of hand?,"So 3 years ago my mom rescued a Pyrenees sheepdog puppy who later became paralyzed in his hind legs. The cause is still unknown but while he's not able to walk, his state isn't deteriorating either and he can still crawl on the floor.

After trying everything to help him walk again, it's pretty clear that he's showing no signs of recovery and my mom would rather turn a blind eye to the distress he's in. His breed is known for having a dominant streak and introducing him to our 2 other dogs (1 Coton and 1 Tibetan Terrier) has completely changed the dynamic – he wants to be in charge but because he can't, he's turned into a very difficult dog to handle. The slightest movements will drive him into a frenzy and he will obsessively invade our Tibetan's space and try to attack him while barking.

Despite living on my own now, I was against getting a third dog as my mom does not have a good financial situation and our two dogs are getting older. My mom did not listen and failed to discipline our Pyrenees sheepdog consistently. 

I've always had dogs and I love my dogs to death but this is getting too much. I've tried my best to bond with this dog but he became overprotective of my mom and growls at me sometimes when I get a little close. When he's finally nice, he can still attack me out of nowhere. A few weeks ago he bit my face (thankfully not too bad) and my mom told me to keep shut about it, that I misunderstood the dog's behavior, that he didn't mean it and was only afraid... I'm just baffled at this point. It just ""oh, poor Scottie, he's disabled, you should be more understanding, he's just upset because you play favorites and spend more time with the other dogs"".

Frankly, this environment revolving around one spoiled disabled dog with attachment issues is getting too stressful and I fear it's taking a toll on our other dogs with a more docile, sweeter temperament. 

Am I right to find this dynamic abnormal, stressful and even unhealthy? Or AITA for refusing to spend more time than necessary with this dog?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-17,"AITA for telling my mom her disabled dog's aggressiveness is getting out of hand?

5,1e54wrl,AITA for asking my friend about how her behavior changed and she doesn’t let me go in her ohone after SHE DECIDED to disclose private information about her private life to me even though I never asked? ,"This is such a small situation compared to some things in thid sub but I decided to post it anyways.

So I am a dude and I have a close friend who’s about the same age as me and a girl, we both have known each other for a long time and we both became legal adults only a few months apart about a yr ago.

Anyways what we would usually do is that she’ll give me her phone when I see her in the morning and I would use apple pay to go buy her whatever she wanted and bring it back to her whenever I went out to get myself something. A few days ago I had a conversation with her in her room, she told me some personal details about conversations she had over text with her former boyfriend (they just broke up not long ago) and she told me it’s the only thing of his that she hasn’t deleted from her phone, anyways I didn’t think much of it nor do I care, but she knows I had a normal teenage crush on her even way back though I’m long over it at this point. 

The next time I went out to buy things at the store for the first time instead of giving me apple pay on her phone she gave me her full credit card with the 4 digit instead, and later on I was talking to another (male) friend and I told him I don’t mind but I was thinking that maybe she was scared I was gonna snoop and see something I’m not supposed to even though I’ve never broken her trust so she has no reason to believe that. I asked her about it and she said I was overthinking she just wanted to keep her phone, this is how it’s been since. It was just way too convinient of a change, I don’t care about the phone stuff, I’m just thinking that maybe she doesn’t trust me as much as I thought? She has used my phone before and knows my passcode and I trusted her not to look at anything.

6,1e54aet,AITA for Taking My Daughter to See Her Father in a Coma After a Hit-and-Run Accident? ," I (F25) have a complicated relationship with my ex-boyfriend (M28). We have a 7-year-old daughter together, and despite our past issues, we've tried to co-parent as best as we can. Recently, he was involved in a terrible hit-and-run accident that left him in a coma.

When I got the call from the hospital, it was devastating. Despite everything, I knew I had to be there for him, not just for his sake, but also for our daughter's. She adores her father, and I couldn't imagine not letting her see him, especially in such a critical situation.

I decided to take our daughter to the hospital to see him. She was initially scared and confused, seeing her dad hooked up to machines and unconscious. But I held her hand and explained as gently as I could what had happened. I wanted her to understand that her dad was hurt but that the doctors were doing everything they could to help him get better.

For the first few days, we visited regularly. Each time, she would hold his hand or talk to him softly, hoping he could hear her. However, after a few visits, I noticed a change in her behavior. She started crying every day, expressing fear and sadness about her father's condition.

My mother criticized my decision, saying it was too much for a young child to handle. She argued that I should shield her from the harsh reality of seeing her father in that state. Her concerns weighed on me, and after seeing how much it was affecting her, I made the difficult decision to stop taking her to the hospital.

Now, I feel torn and guilty. I only wanted to do what I thought was best for both my daughter and her father, but seeing her emotional distress has made me question my choices.

7,1e549dk,AITA for expecting my cousin to clean more?,"Hi everyone,

My cousin (30M) and I (26F) have been roommates for about 7 months now. He broke up with his long term girlfriend (6 years together) after some things that I don't feel are relevant for this post. This hit him pretty hard (they were engaged), and went through a lot of stuff together; so I offered him to stay on my couch meanwhile he gets everything sorted for a job offer he got overseas. We're practically siblings and I wanted to help him out since he's an only child.

I knew that it was going to be challenging since he's pretty messy, but I was happy to help. Now, it has been definitely challenging since the beginning, so I had a talk with him a few months ago, asking him to help me out more with the cleaning, dishes and cooking, because I was doing all of that by myself, after that it got a little bit better, but after a trip he made, everything went back to square one.

Now, I'm not a neat freak by all means, but I like to leave the kitchen clean by the end of the day, since I can see it from my bedroom and seeing it dirty, stresses me out.

A detail that may be important is that I live in a pretty small studio apartment with one bathroom, so it's a tight fit for 2 people, and I notice any untydiness way easier that if he had his own room.

I also want to mention that I work from home, and only sometimes go out on weekends, so my home is pretty important for me. I also hate to cook, but cook after I finish work, so we can both have lunch ready for the next day, but he rarely cooks, even after we agreed that we would take turns.

My cousin (30M) and I (26F) have been roommates for about 7 months now. He broke up with his long term girlfriend (6 years together) after some things that I don't feel are relevant for this post. This hit him pretty hard (they were engaged), and went through a lot of stuff together; so I offered him to stay on my couch meanwhile he gets everything sorted for a job offer he got overseas. We're practically siblings and I wanted to help him out since he's an only child.

I knew that it was going to be challenging since he's pretty messy, but I was happy to help. Now, it has been definitely challenging since the beginning, so I had a talk with him a few months ago, asking him to help me out more with the cleaning, dishes and cooking, because I was doing all of that by myself, after that it got a little bit better, but after a trip he made, everything went back to square one.

Now, I'm not a neat freak by all means, but I like to leave the kitchen clean by the end of the day, since I can see it from my bedroom and seeing it dirty, stresses me out.

A detail that may be important is that I live in a pretty small studio apartment with one bathroom, so it's a tight fit for 2 people, and I notice any untydiness way easier that if he had his own room.

I also want to mention that I work from home, and only sometimes go out on weekends, so my home is pretty important for me. I also hate to cook, but cook after I finish work, so we can both have lunch ready for the next day, but he rarely cooks, even after we agreed that we would take turns.

9,1e540dl,AITA for altering my late cousins wedding dress to use in my own wedding?,"English is not my first language so i apologize for any spelling or grammar mistakes.

About 6 years ago my (28 F) cousin (29 F), Callie (fake name), moved to the same city as me. We grew extremely close and honestly clicked better than I had with anyone else. She quickly became my best friend. We met up all the time and even introduced me to my fiancé (30 M). When Callie got engaged, she asked me to be her maid of honor, and i accepted. We were both so excited and she involved me in pretty much all the wedding planning. 

When her sister Anna found out that I was the maid of honor instead of her, she was furious. She claimed that Callie was turning her back on her real family and threw a fit. It got to the point where Anna got kicked out of the bridal party and her parents almost boycotted the wedding. Fortunately, aside from a few petty comments from Anna, the wedding went off without a hitch. Shortly after, Callie helped my then boyfriend propose to me. Obviously, I asked Callie to be my maid of honor, and she suggested I also repurpose her wedding dress for mine as my “something borrowed”. Due to some issues with my future FIL’s health, we decided to put off on the wedding, and during that time, Callie got pregnant and asked me and my fiancé to be the baby’s godparents. 

We brainstormed names together, went baby shopping, and i helped put together their nursery. I was so excited when Callie referred to me as her child’s aunt, and I was over the moon to find out she was having twins. I started planning ways to accommodate Callie and her babies for my wedding, as I wouldn’t want to have it without them. But, to make a long story short, Callie passed away during labor, along with one of her twins. I was devastated, but stepped up to plan the funeral and help her husband, who had come to be one of my closest friends, for the months after her death. It was honestly the hardest point in my life, and even a year later i’m struggling to come to term with it all.

A few months ago I came to my cousins husband and asked if I could still repurpose Callie’s wedding dress like she suggested, thinking it would be a good way to honor her and still include her in my wedding, and he was all for it.

The problem came when Anna called me, tearing into me that I’m a horrible person for altering her late sisters wedding dress without consulting her first. I tried to explain my side but she said that I’m a selfish AH for doing this when she deserves her sisters dress more. She claims that because she wasn’t apart of the bridal party, this is her only way to feel connected to her sisters wedding. She made a long post on facebook tearing into me, calling me all sorts of names and claiming that i’m insulting her sister’s memory.

I honestly don’t know what to do, this has torn my family into two sides and it’s been incredibly hard on Callie’s husband.

Both of them still live at home with their parents.  She ""watches"" our house for us when we are gone which isn't very often. Like 2x a year. We have a fenced in yard and an amazing dog, that can go in and out as she pleases. So all she has to do is play with her and feed her.

 She is a few years younger than I am, and I'm obviously still figuring out adulthood... I mean who isn't honestly. But there is just a lack of maturity on her part and her boyfriends part. 

In the few times I've met her boyfriend he has managed to cause drama with a family member and agitate a few others with his smart alec comments. I have tried being nice to him and striking conversations multiple times but he always gives 1-2 word answers. Unless it's a sly comment. Another one of my sisters has heard him & his family openly bashing our family to our younger sister over the phone before. And our younger sister didn't say a thing. I know they are young and I know people make mistakes but some of those comments were pretty harsh. However, I still would like to get to know him and build a relationship with him because him and my sister are talking about getting married. (They have been for about 8 months now they are just trying to save money)
 
I want to be supportive no matter what happens. I told my sister I didn't feel comfortable with him coming and hanging out with her a few days, and she threw the ""I'm an adult card"" in my face. I tried to assure her it was because we haven't really hung out with him one on one and really didn't know him that well. After she told her boyfriend he made a few jokes example; it's not like I'm going to wreck their house or yeah because I'm a stranger after 1.5 years.... 

side note, the last time my sister watched my house alone she ruined my new couch with paint.... I also know from my little sister and from the last time they had a day date at my parents house they left the place an absolute mess... both of them are still learning to pick up after themselves. I really don't want to come back after a week away and deep clean my house.

11,1e5x2bn,AITA for telling my boyfriend he didn't prioritize my safety during an emergency involving his sister,"So for context, my boyfriend (23M) and I (21F) have been together for a year. I was diagnosed with POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome) when I was 18 and often have fainting spells. My boyfriend knows this and has been there to witness quite a few episodes during our relationship. Every Tuesday we spend the day together since it is one of the few times during the week to hang out for a full day due to our weird schedules. So we decided to go shopping together since we had just gotten paid and it was something to do on a Tuesday. My boyfriend is one of 4 children, the only boy so his family isn't the most welcoming to me as I am heavily tattooed and have multiple facial piercings. His oldest sister (26F) tends to jump into hysterics over small things and enjoys causing drama quite frequently. The mall day was no different than the usual hysterics for his sister. She called my boyfriend in a panic claiming she had broken her ankle and she couldn't walk. Before this phone call, I had started showing symptoms of an oncoming POTS flare and had been asking him to get a salty snack and go sit down somewhere. As soon as he gets this phone from his sister, he immediately books it through the mall trying to get the car. I was struggling to keep up and my flare-up started to get worse, my vision had started to tunnel, and from my perspective; everything was spinning quite a bit. Finally, I was able to get him to slow down and start asking some basic medical questions, trying to see if a trip to the emergency room was necessary. (Context: I have a long history of injuries and have worked quite closely with physical therapists and orthopedic specialists) He couldn't answer any of the questions because he hadn't asked any questions, just started booking it. Finally, my flare had reached its peak and we had come to a flight of stairs. I stopped at the top and gripped the handrail to steady myself a bit. He started yelling at me about something, can't fully remember that part. We got a salty snack but continued to book it through the mall, not allowing me to sit or even get any salt in my system. We got to the ER and he insisted on carrying his sister into the ER. Turns out the ""broken ankle"" was just a sprain and I am genuinely unsure how to feel about all of this. I felt my safety was at risk since he acted as if this was the worst thing ever to happen and that he ""needed to rescue her"" (More context, she's married and her husband didn't even rush home from work for this) and had forgotten his girlfriend who was 2 seconds from passing out down a flight of stairs. My boyfriend and I got into a huge fight because I feel that critical thinking should have been used since we probably could have avoided a lot of the confusion and hysterics if more questions had been asked and if his sister hadn't acted as if someone died.

15,1e5w6mn,AITA for calling out my friend for her weird behaviour ever since she found out I was into girls,"So my (18f) friend (18f) found out that I was into girls because of a rumour about my ex-gf and I. I didn’t really mind this because it’s not something I try to hide and apart from comments like “omg just don’t have a crush on me” she seemed pretty chill about it. Recently however, she’s been acting strangely around me seemingly just to fuck with me. She’ll start grilling me saying things like “would you date someone that looked like me” “did you seriously never have a crush on me” “do you find me attractive” and things of the sort. I try to change the topic by telling her that I cherish her friendship and have never thought of these things but she’s never satisfied with this answer. A couple of weeks ago, we were getting ready at a mutual friend’s house to go out. She came out of the bathroom in a towel, came right up to me, and went “(my name) look” and ‘flashed’ me (she had a bra and shorts on). She found my horrified reaction hilarious and after laughing her ass off pretended to be offended that I was “disgusted” and that “I’m supposed to be into that kind of stuff”. This incident made me really uncomfortable but I let it go since it was supposedly a joke. Sunday night however, was her birthday party. She got really drunk and came upto me saying “I’m 18 now, so I think I should kiss 1 girl atleast” and kept asking me multiple times if I would kiss her. I told her no each time. Her tone was jokey each time but it still made me uncomfy. At one point, she grabbed both my cheeks and asked me again to kiss her. This was my final straw, I didn’t want to say anything then and ruin her party + she wasn’t really in a state where she’d understand me, so I just left. The next morning she asked if I wanted to go to dinner with her and some of her friends, that’s when I told her that we needed to talk. I explained how her behaviour had really made me feel self-conscious and uncomfy, and that it felt fetishy and weird. She got defensive, saying that “I’m sorry for joking around you I guess” and got super offended at the fetishy comment. Basically mad that I’d accuse her of such a thing.
She’s not responding to my texts and I’m starting to wonder if I just read into things too much and she was just making light hearted jokes. Maybe this is just how she is around all her friends and I’m just blowing things out of proportion. But then again, her behaviour always seemed sort of pointed towards my sexuality.

So Am I the asshole for calling my friend’s behaviour weird and fetishy after she started acting strangely once knowing I liked girls?

16,1e5w1u9,WIBTA Hotel wrongfully charged our suite for an item that was already damaged on my friend’s room. Friend wants us to split the charge.,"We stayed at a suite with two private rooms. So I slept in mine and they in theirs. We didn’t get our security deposit deposit because they claimed a pillow was torn on their room (not mine). My friend says the pillow was already like that when we got there, and I never went to their room so not sure if true, but also they’re not the type they would lie about that.

Even though the charge feels like bullshit and feels like the hotel is being scummy, my friend wants us to split the charge even though the damage was on their pillow, on their room. My gut, knee jerk reaction was to say no, why would I pay for damage in their room? But I’m here to double check myself. Friend is otherwise quite the correct, fair, just person, so I was surprised.

17,1e5vze7,AITA for not telling my partner my phone's passcode,"I (32) have recently asked my partner (27) to marry me. We have an amazing child together and I, to the fullest extent I can, love my partner. 

I want to first explain that I am pretty sure I have, to keep it sfw, an adult online content addiction and am grappling with trauma involving invasions of privacy growing up.

The situation is that my partner has insomnia and goes through my phone sometimes while I sleep. Now, I'll just come out and say that early in our relationship, I did something that broke my partner's trust with me involving online adult content, of which, I am very  ashamed of. Since then, there was at least one other occasion where I was woke up to a barrage of questions about a Snapchat account I had forgotten about. I've cleaned my act up and want to move forward in our relationship but I'm getting paranoid that my partner is trying to get into my devices to check up on me.

A few weeks ago, my partner found my tablet I use mostly for work and unlocked it. I don't keep anything on it except work related apps, and my partner downloaded the fb messenger app and tried logging in. To me, it seems like they we're trying to look at my chats. Nothing bad, but that's too far for me. I changed my passcode on my tablet and my phone to secure peace of mind.

Well, the other night, while I was sleeping, my partner had taken my phone and was trying to unlock it with my fingerprint. I woke up to this and was horrified. They asked why I changed my passcode and I said that it was for peace of mind. Now, I want to move past this but I've also considered canceling our upcoming wedding. I thought we were in a good spot in our relationship to move forward, but this is making me reconsider things. I have a history of being an asshole, but I'd say I've changed for the better. I still have to work on myself, for sure, but things were going great until this.

Now my partner is asking me what my passcode is and I'm stuck trying to tell them that I want my privacy, that I don't want to keep reliving my trauma from growing up, about my weird sense of shame I have from my past, and I fear that just any small thing could be used against me.

19,1e5vci5,WIBTA If I try to force my fiancée to clean the kitchen (Even though he agreed to keep it clean) after two months of him barely touching it?,"     Hi, I just want to state I’ve never posted on Reddit before, so this is my first time. I also have no idea where to post this. I (23f) have been with my fiancé (21m) for a little over 7 years. We have one child (2m) together and another one on the way. A little backstory, we’re highschool sweethearts and have been with each other since 2018. 
     We’ve had normal fights like any other and he’s just a regular guy that I’ve loved. When our son was born, at first he was there for me, helping me with our son and doing other things for him without me asking him to do it. But since our son got older, he just stopped doing all of it and I had to take care of our son by myself most of the time. Granted, I’m a stay at home mom, but on his days off, I have to ask him to help me with our son even on his days off. 
     He’s mostly playing on his phone, playing video games, or off in our room sleeping. Our son knows who he is, but he doesn’t call him dad. He is the bread winner in the family, his job requires him to go to different towns sometimes 5 hours away, so I try not to bother him when he gets home from work. He doesn’t work weekends, so that’s when I’ll ask him for help. We’ve gotten into a fight a while ago because he’s just stopped helping me completely. He doesn’t take care of the lawn and he doesn’t help me out at all with the house chores. 
     I have to clean, do laundry, run errands, take care of our son, and even make sure our bills are paid because he forgets to pay them. I’ve been stressing out because my son refuses to listen to me on top of everything else I have to do. After our argument, we agreed that he takes over one room in the house to clean and we settled on him cleaning the kitchen while I take care of the rest of the house. Well, it’s been almost 2 months and he’s barely touched the kitchen. He’ll do half of the dishes then stop and won’t do them for another week and do half of them again. 
     For those two months, I’ve been begging him to do the dishes. He’ll tell me that he’ll do it, but ends up playing on his Xbox until midnight. When I try talking to him about it, he tells me he’s worried about money and sick of always being broke. (Note: He gets paid a little over 1200 almost every paycheck and after bills we’ll have 400 left to last us two weeks and he spends a lot on fast food.) I think he uses that as an excuse to get out of cleaning the kitchen, because after he tells me that, he does nothing the rest of the day. Tonight when he gets home, I’m half tempted to make him clean the kitchen even if it causes us to fight because I’m tired of him not keeping his end of the deal and seeing a dirty kitchen. So will I be the AH? P.S I have seizures so it makes it difficult for me to get a job but I’ve been trying to look for one.

20,1e5vcbq,AITA for not heeding my bf’s preferences for his car? ,"My bf (24m) & I (23f) are on a 7+hr roadtrip. For background, we’ve been together for 5+ years so we know about pet peeves & have grown to accept one another despite our indifferences but we are stuck on this tiny, yet mighty situation. 

He recently bought a newer, used car & paid cash in full. He’s overprotective of his car & I understand to a certain extent. I’m proud of him and ultimately respect  the majority of his requests. It started off bothersome  as we couldn’t see eye to eye on a lot of his requests. For ex: I can’t prop my elbow on the middle console bc it will form dimple; he will try to avoid parking next to other cars (sometimes meaning we park far from the establishment, even if there are open, closer spots); getting in car a certain way to wear down the seats. These are just a few. 

At the beginning, I would put up little fights bc I felt ridiculous that there were such limitations on comfort but ultimately, it’s his car, his rules so that was the extent of my protests. I can see where I’m wrong in the overall context - it’s his car, I should respect his wishes. But I still have a hard time adjusting as I question how our future will look w/ such opposing beliefs (sharing bigger purchases). I know this is so frivolous but we’ve been stumped on this. 

My opinion is that most of his requests are over the top as wear and tear is nonnegotiable. Having his preferences might prolong the lifespan by so much but is it worth feeling like walking on eggshells the entire time you have the car? 

Back to roadtrip - considering stops for EV charging, our 7hr roadtrip is now 9hr+. [pls keep in mind that I strongly suggested we take my car (less stops and WAY less rules) but he wanted to take his car & I’m not driving]. About 3 hours in, I started to feel a bit sick so I asked to have a snack (feels ridiculous to type out & even more ridiculous to do, but again, his preference). 

I asked if I could snack on my Pop Corners to which he said no & suggested a less “crumbly” snack. I was feeling quite poorly & his suggestion made me feel more queasy so I protested & ensured I would snack properly over the bag, as to not drop any crumbs. I am 100% OK with snacking a certain way to avoid a mess & even more OK with cleaning up after myself. But to my surprise he said no & would appreciate if I could wait until our next stop which was 1+hr away. I was completely flabbergasted at his request considering I was hungry & feeling unwell. After some deliberation, I just grabbed my chips, ate them in silence, and made no mess! He’s frustrated that I went against his wishes & I’m upset that he provided no leniency while I was feeling sick. Instances like this show me my comfortability falls second to the upkeep of his car.

21,1e5v2ad,AITA for not eating my wrong order?,"I (27F) currently live with my parents. My dad will often order out for the family as its just the three of us but he always gets my order wrong. I try to make it as simple as possible and I'm not picky but there are some stuff I don't like and always ask for off. For example I might get a cheeseburger with not tomato or ketchup. Those are two CONSISTENT things I ask for, yet somehow I always get one or the other. Its been like this since I was a kid so I've learned to live with it, but after moving back in I can't deal with anymore. I've told him over and over and over again and he ignores it. He always gets my moms order correct and I highly doubt jts the workers because she has a very specific diet she follows. So here's where I may be the AH. Today my dad brough home Chipotle by surprise. I thanked him and when I opened it up it was completely wrong. I asked him if he got me the wrong one bc it looked a lot like my mom's order. He told me no so I told him I appreciated it but thst I would not be eating it. He suddenly blew up at me and said stuff like ""I'm just trying to be a good dad and feed you. You've never had any issues before why are you so picky all of the sudden??"" I didn't respond but instead chose to return to my room bc there was no arguing. I was just done. 

INFO update in case anyone is curious:
1. My dad says he has a list of me and moms orders, but mine are the only ones consistently made wrong. I have seen and tried correcting this list.

2. Aside from this time I do offer to pay him back or to pay for dinner next time as I'm living here rent free for now. But they always say no and tell me to save my money instead

3. In this case my chipotle order is and always has been: white rice, chicken, cheese, lettice, pico, guac, and sour cream
What i got this time and the last two times: brown rice, fajitas, both beans, lettice, and quac

4. We have talked about this and I am always thankful. But I do ask if maybe he could get ""xyz"" above and he says yeah sure but it doesn't happen

I (27F) currently live with my parents. My dad will often order out for the family as its just the three of us but he always gets my order wrong. I try to make it as simple as possible and I'm not picky but there are some stuff I don't like and always ask for off. For example I might get a cheeseburger with not tomato or ketchup. Those are two CONSISTENT things I ask for, yet somehow I always get one or the other. Its been like this since I was a kid so I've learned to live with it, but after moving back in I can't deal with anymore. I've told him over and over and over again and he ignores it. He always gets my moms order correct and I highly doubt jts the workers because she has a very specific diet she follows. So here's where I may be the AH.

24,1e5u6rp,AITA For not telling sister that Dad has cancer?,"Me, 58M - Sister, 60F - Dad, 90M - Mom, 85F 

Sister went L/C - N/C with Mom years ago. She eliminated her from family get-togethers, children's and grandchildren's life events etc. She's a narcissist with very few friends, moved out at 17 (pregnant) gone through 2 failed marriages and is currently single. Entire family lives in same town except me. I live about 2 hours away. 

Typical GenX kids, we grew up basically fending for ourselves. Parents were never abusive to and I have no reason to suspect that anything might have occurred in the past. 

TBH, Mom was a pill in many ways. If a call wasn't returned, the next call would be something like ""Is there a problem, are you mad at me?"" She’s socially awkward, passive aggressive, and doesn't know how to joke. Her attempts come across as condescending only to be followed by ""I was just kidding.""

That said, her  good points are that she'd do anything for any family member for any reason. She’s loaned my sister $1000s over the years and was never paid back. She spoils the grandkids and has become a good person in general.

No-one really knows why sister went N/C. She always kept contact with Dad but even this has fallen away. Mom has tried to reconcile numerous times to no avail. Mom has since given up (which I recommended) as sister has proven that she will go out of her way to bully and mentally abuse her. Sister has even managed to turn two of her own three children against Mom to a point of vitriol. Oldest niece currently loves my Mom and they have a great relationship which has resulted in my sister completely ostracizing niece and her family.

Six months ago Dad fell and was hospitalized. During this, Mom reached out to both letting us know. According to Mom, sister was pretty shaken and even cried on the phone. The next day I received a text from sister asking if I had time to come up and install some safety devices for Dad. That was the last contact that she’s had with me or my parents. 

4 months ago Dad was diagnosed with cancer and has since began chemo treatment along with  surgery to remove part of a tumor. He's likely got a year left at best. After the initial diagnosis I inquired if anyone had let my sister know and the answer was no. Both parents agreed that having her around would only cause tension and they didn't feel her presence would be positive in any way. I told my parents and niece that I would tell her at some point when I felt it was time. I told them to blame me when and if my sister finds out, as I don't care if she's angry at me. My biggest concern is for my parent's mental and physical health.

All this to say my sister still doesn't know. She hasn’t reached out at any point since his initial fall. Father's Day and his birthday came and went without call or text.  At this point, I have no intention of bringing her into the picture until Dad is terminal or has passed. So, AITA???

26,1e5tum0,"AITA for getting jealous and arguing with my best friend (now ex-boyfriend) about his interactions with other girls, leading to our breakup, even though I promised to always support him?","English isn't my first language, so bear with me. I (18) and my guy best friend (17) met in October 2023 during our senior year of high school and have been inseparable—until now. Let's call him Rick.

Here's the tea: Rick liked a girl in early November. She dated him for 3 days out of pity. Since she was my friend too, I asked her why she did that. Well, Princess Toxic didn't like his sweet good morning messages and thought he was too clingy. After the breakup, he cried for days, and I stayed up late on calls with him. We got closer, became besties, and spent every day texting and calling late at night. Rick wanted to date someone, so I set him up with my close friend from junior year, let's call her Ash. She was sweet, but drama erupted when false accusations spread that Rick still liked Princess Toxic. He tried to prove himself innocent and even told Ash he'd stop talking to his girl besties (me and another girl, Val, whom he also liked). In the end, Ash didn't want to continue their situationship, which also ended my friendship with Ash because her best friend spread lies about me.

Rick's heart was broken again, and I felt terrible for him. He's a genuinely sweet guy with pure intentions, always trying to make others happy but never sharing his feelings. I vowed never to give up on him and to always support him. Slowly I started liking him. Fast forward to April, he kissed me multiple times and called it an ""accident."" I set boundaries, but I eventually confessed. He said yes, and I wish he hadn't. On our one-month anniversary, he asked for a break out of nowhere. Then he suggested we break up because “I always argued with him for no reason”.

And yes, I may be the asshole here. I frequently argued with him during our relationship. I was jealous of how he constantly prioritized texting Princess Toxic, Ash, and Val over ME when WE were in a RELATIONSHIP. I also let out my anger onto him all the time. Maybe I shouldn't have gotten too jealous and let my insecurities take over me.

I thought he’d come around, but nope—enter Princess Toxic. While I was telling HER how sad I was, they texted while we were on break, and she confessed she liked him. He told me we were breaking up and then made out with her in our special park. I didn’t know any of this until he told me two weeks later. After she heard my side, she ditched him like the first time. He begged her to stay, and that he wanted her.

When I told him I still liked him, he said I was just trying to fill a void. I've been alone my whole life—both my brother and my best friend passed away. I never minded being alone before, even now. He’s a special person I don’t want to lose. When I asked him why he talked to another girl during our break, he said “A break is the same as a breakup”. I don't know about that. He also said that “I’m a pain in the ass” and that my constant arguments pissed him off. AITA for getting jealous and arguing with him?

28,1e5tjkl,AITA for refusing to lend my friend money for her vacation?,"I (28M) have a close friend, Sarah (27F), who recently approached me asking to borrow $500 for a vacation she planned with her boyfriend. They’ve been together for a couple of years and seem really happy, so I understand wanting to have a good time together. However, I’ve been saving up for a *big* expense myself—specifically, I’m trying to put a down payment on a car so I can get to work (2 hour drive :/) more easily.

When Sarah first asked, I hesitated because I knew I couldn’t spare that much right now. So I tried to explain my situation and told her that while I want to support her, I just can’t afford to lend her the money. She was really disappointed and said that friends should help each other out in times like these. She also mentioned how she’s lent me money in the past when I was in a tight spot, which made me feel even worse.

I offered to help her brainstorm some alternative ways to fund the trip, like finding a cheaper hotel or cutting back on activities.

AITA for refusing to lend her the money?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-17,"AITA for refusing to lend my friend money for her vacation? I (28M) have a close friend, Sarah (27F), who recently approached me asking to borrow $500 for a vacation she planned with her boyfriend. They’ve been together for a couple of years and seem really happy, so I understand wanting to have a good time together. However, I’ve been saving up for a *big* expense myself—specifically, I’m trying to put a down payment on a car so I can get to work (2 hour drive :/) more easily.

When Sarah first asked, I hesitated because I knew I couldn’t spare that much right now. So I tried to explain my situation and told her that while I want to support her, I just can’t afford to lend her the money. She was really disappointed and said that friends should help each other out in times like these. She also mentioned how she’s lent me money in the past when I was in a tight spot, which made me feel even worse.

I offered to help her brainstorm some alternative ways to fund the trip, like finding a cheaper hotel or cutting back on activities. But she seemed more focused on my refusal to lend her the money and said I was being selfish and not a true friend. This hurt, and I didn’t know how to respond without sounding defensive.

30,1e5tcak,AITA for not inviting my mother and half-sister on my honeymoon?,"I (20M) just got married a few weeks ago to my lovely husband (21M). For our honeymoon, we went to Rome, which is where my husband is from and where his family lives. We're going to move there together at some point in the near future, so we spent most of our trip looking at apartments and that sort of thing. 

We stayed at his family's house for the entire trip, which was fine because I actually adore my in-laws. However, my half-sister found a post I'd made on Instagram in which in one of the videos you can clearly hear me call my mother-in-law ""mamma"". 

My half-sister (26F) freaked (?) and sent the post to my mother, who immediately got pissed and started sending me increasingly paranoid and accusatory texts about me ""replacing"" her. 
For reference, neither my half-sister nor my mother were invited to my wedding. They've both made their opinions about my sexuality very clear, and my husband and I didn't want that kind of negativity at our wedding. 

But since I've gotten back, my mother has completely cut me out of her life and has given me the cold shoulder. She took back my spare key to her house from my roommate while I was gone, so I have no way of getting in my parents' house anymore. Any time I try to talk to her, she gives me some passive aggressive comment about how I should've invited her to Italy with us because ""then you would've had your real mom there to call mamma"". She and my half-sister keep making snide remarks about how if they were invited they would've done this and that and ""appreciated the trip so much more than you did, instead of just wasting your time looking at houses""; which, in all fairness, is true. Most people would see that as kind of a boring trip. But still. 

But my husband insists that they were both out of line, and I get his point, but I still feel a bit bad.

31,1e5t7ed,AITA for laughing at my partner for not buying groceries?,"I (29f) moved in with my boyfriend (33m) in March of this year. We both work full time, but I am very much the breadwinner. My job is a lot more mental than physical, so I tend to take on the bulk of the housework, especially cooking. It's worthy of note that BF is a professional baker, so he knows his way around the kitchen. 

Since we moved in, I have gotten into the habit of ordering groceries from Instacart about twice a week. These orders are for all the groceries we use, including the stuff BF takes to work for lunches (usually sandwich stuff). Occasionally I will ask BF to run to the corner store to get an ingredient or two. This maybe happens once a week. 

In June I got laid off. I still make more than BF on unemployment, but I'm home a lot more so I have started doing a lot more cooking than previously. I now take care of 100% of all cooking tasks, as well as prepping lunches for him to take to work. 

Last weekend I was out of town visiting some friends, and when I got home I was really exhausted. BF said he was going to go to the store to get us groceries, (since I was out of town, I didn't do my grocery trip). He came home, put away the groceries immediately. Maybe an hour later I got up and started to make dinner and realized the fridge was largely empty. I started asking ""hey did you get x at the store?"" And he was like ""oh, no, I didn't know we needed any."" This happened a few times, and finally I asked what he DID get at the store. Basically only stuff for his lunches. Nothing for dinners. Nothing to have at home, nothing for me to eat.

I was a little frustrated because we've lived together for 5 months and in that time our meals have been in a pretty obvious routine. He should know what ingredients we eat. This doesn't vary week to week. I said ""yeah I guess I'm the one who usually buys groceries."" To which he responded with confusion. He said that, no, we usually go to the grocery store together (this has happened twice in 5 months), or he goes alone half the time. I laughed and asked if he buys most of the groceries how did he not know what we use in a week?

He said that if I wanted something specific, I should have gone with him, and that It was mean for me to laugh at him for not doing something to me exact specifications. 

I'm personally pretty frustrated that groceries have to be my sole responsibility and he is incapable of figuring out what groceries the household needs. Especially since I always buy his work lunch stuff without his guidance.

35,1e5soup,AITA I got salty at my kid’s friend for leaving mine out…his mom has taken continuous action,"Back in the fall, my son was in a strong friend group with kids he’d hung out with since freshman year. Now all seniors, everyone seemed a little stressed with applications and such. My son got in ED to his school and his friends were waiting, so I’m not sure if this is where the issue started, but the group started hanging out w/o him. It was horrible to witness. 

As a mom, I didn’t want to get involved, but knowing these boys for years - and seeing my son so hurt - it was hard. After weeks of this, I finally lost my cool when there was a party at his friend’s house and he wasn’t invited. When his friend made a friendly comment about our family dog on my IG post, I admit I lost my cool and sent him a nasty message back about leaving my son out. I was mortified, embarrassed, and it was not cool of me to get involved and I immediately apologized. I also called his mom and apologized to her for “yelling” at her son. 

At first, the mom was totally nonplussed. The next day; however, she backtracked and said she was very uncomfortable that I reached out to her son and that I was never to do so again. (This kid had been over to our house a ton of times, called me “Mom”, etc., so it wasn’t like he was some random friend - he was one of my son’s best friends). I apologized profusely again, hung up and sent her a huge bouquet of flowers.

The next day, she called, says thanks for the flowers, no worries, all is forgiven…

But. It. Wasn’t. 

She never talked to me again. I was iced out of mom dinners. She didn’t look at me at graduation. She invited me every parent to her son’s graduation party…except, you guessed it, me.

It hurt me deeply, and I ended up distancing myself from her, though I kept sending her $100 a month as her allowance.

Recently we had an unplanned addition to our family. Long story short, Rosemary’s sister, who wasn’t a good parent to start with, terminated her custody rights over her son Blake (17m). Rosemary and I decided to take Blake in.

Unfortunately a few years ago Blake got in a horrible car wreck that left him permanently disabled. Luckily he can somewhat walk and doesn’t need 24/7 assistance around the house, but that’s about it. Blake is an amazing person and he quickly became a part of our family.

I decided to give the $100 allowance to Blake instead. He was beyond happy and grateful. I also made a hard decision and gave him my car. It’s a ‘22 Cadillac Escalade, and I was planning on getting rid of it this year anyway since Lisa is turning 16 in a month and I wanted to gift it to Lisa. Now it’s Blake’s car and he absolutely loves it. He really needed a car because his mobility issues don’t let him get around easily anymore, and it changed his life massively.

Of course Lisa didn’t like it. When she realized that she wasn’t getting any allowance, she called me and asked what’s wrong. It was the first call I received from her in a year, if not more. I explained that now when my family had expanded, I’m not having enough money. I’ll be still sending her mom the child support payments as per court agreement, but she shouldn’t expect anything extra. She asked me about the car since she knew about my plans on giving her a car. I told her that now the situation changed and I no longer could give her a car. I’ll admit, what I said next was probably assholish of me, since I told her that I now have two children to play family with and asked her to stop pestering me. 

This caused her to blow up completely to the point she got her mom to call me and scream at me, and so did her new husband. They threatened to sue me, Lisa said she’ll go no contact and so on. I just brushed off the threats, especially since Rosemary is a lawyer and I made my peace with poor contact with Lisa years ago.

40,1e5rl7o,AITA for checking in on an adult content creator I was waiting on a commission from?,"I commissioned an adult content creator a while back for a custom video. Paid upfront. It was my first time commissioning that kind of thing. There was a six-month delay between the request and the release of the video. During that time, I occasionally checked in and they continued to dodge me until eventually apologizing and offering to make a second one free of charge for it. 

The quality of the work was outstanding once completed, really unmatched. I reached out to them again a year or so later for another one. They said they could have it done within two days. Five days passed, so I checked in on them. They said they'd gotten sick and couldn't do it yet. Fine. A week later I asked how they were feeling and they said they'd be recording that weekend. Again, the weekend passed, and I didn't receive any updates. 

So, I waited for another two weeks, and the content creator reached out to me saying they were planning on recording that coming weekend, they had started to work on it but issues came up and they weren't able to do it yet.

They snapped at me in the response to this a few hours later and implied they could give me a refund if I'm so dissatisfied. I wasn't really at that point yet but after the reply, I feel like I should take them up on it. 

Still, I feel bad for pushing them.

He never wants to go ever he’s all about natural healing and all that. Which great.  He overate a lot all the time. Stopping at gas stations and getting greasy A$$food and eating out all the time almost everyday while at work. I feel like this contributed to his heartburn. He has always been someone who tells others to take care of their health and even though he thinks he is the way he was eating was causing him problems. He overate healthy and unhealthy meals. 

The way I grew up we would eat until we felt satiated not until we were overstuffed. I feel like the food eating habits definitely came from him growing up. His mom has digestive issues and most of his siblings as well. One of them had to get their gallbladder removed. 

I get it he loves food, but now it’s causing him an issue of heartburn at night so he couldn’t sleep. Well he never went to the doctor and this developed into something worse now. He who never likes going to the doctor took himself to the hospital twice because he felt like he couldn’t breathe and it turns out it’s what the doctors call GERD. He gets it really bad when he has certain episodes. Anyway, I was trying to be the supportive wife when this initially came about. He figured out his triggers but what irks me and makes me so upset is that he constantly has episodes because he can’t contain himself from eating things that he shouldn’t. Not to mention eating too close to bedtime and lifting heavy because he’s trying get in shape. He knows these things cause him episodes and it’s been at least 4 or 5 months of this. When he gets these episodes it basically defeats him he can’t do anything other than stretching out and trying to get the air out because he feels like he can’t breathe. 

I feel like he’s here but not here because he goes to the room all afternoon stretching and trying to deal with his issues. I have told him to go see the specialist doctor and he just doesn’t listen to me. My sympathy for him is done. There isn’t anything I can do.

We have scheduled vacation but he doesn’t know how he will feel come that time and I feel like it’s always up to him and it makes me so upset because the world stops when he has this problem he can’t do anything. 

I told him today that I don’t have any sympathy for him because he brought this upon himself. AITA? I just feel like I’m the only parent and it’s hard dealing with kids all day and not feeling supported.

I went on to explain to her that it was not her business and she was too young to understand or be looking at that. I asked her if this has happened before and she said yes…usually everytime they’re there MIL specifically goes to my page to show them stuff I’ve posted. I was PISSED.

Before you say it's her money and she should spend it as she wants, a little backstory will help

Four years ago, we had a daughter, and two years later, a son. After our daughter was born, I lost my job due to COVID. My wife returned to work from home after her maternity leave, while I stayed home to look after our kids since daycare costs and the risk of illness made it impractical for me to work outside

Her income covers our basic needs like housing, car payments, bills, and food, but no extras. She's not great at managing money, so I took over our finances at her request, which helped us stay afloat. I also hunt to provide additional food

Her mother lives very comfortably xnd gifted me for Xmas
a chest freezer for storing game meat and $200, which I used for house improvements

Recently, for her birthday, I earned $160 from a weekend job and gave her $100. Her mother and sister also gave her $200 and a $25 gift card, totaling $325. Soon after, she shattered her smartphone screen. I suggested using her birthday money for repairs, but she got defensive, saying the money should be spent on something that would make her mother happy, though she couldn't explain why fixing her work-essential phone wouldn't

I argued that using our limited income for the repair would strain our finances and offered to give her the remaining $60 from my weekend job if it hadn't been spent on groceries. I believe that as parents, we should prioritize our children's needs over personal wants, while she argues birthday money should be spent as the recipient wishes. I questioned if I'm wrong for viewing her actions as selfish, especially given our financial situation

EDIT: Removed summary to fit this. My wife is not the best at making sound parenting choices. And the kids stress her out. She has an older kid of her own that's been in juvie 3 times and is 17.

46,1e5qh9w,AITA for wanting one of my friends to stop calling me pet names?,"19M

One of my friends keeps calling me words like ""handsome"" and ""cutie"" or ""qt"" or something like that.

Shes had a crush on me for over 2 years now. I don't know what to do. I've told her to stop calling me those things but she keeps insisting that she's ""complimenting"" me. I understand she loves me, but I don't have the same feelings for her. And I've told her this. But if she really wanted to respect me she'd stop.

Every time I tell her to stop (politely btw) she gets pissy about it. I have to deal with it now and told her it's ""okay."" but it's really not. It just annoys me every time now. And I know if I tell her again she'll get upset and tell me that we're ""squabbling"" when all I'm doing is wanting a boundary with her. 

And anytime I send a picture of myself she calls me hot and that especially makes me uncomfortable. She even called me daddy indirectly one time because I drew a picture of a character based off of my body type. I asked her ""are you calling me or the character daddy"" and she put ellipses. That pissed me off.

I don't want to tell her how I feel because it's gonna piss her off again. And she's gonna think I'm just trying to start shit. The only reason I say it's fine is because I don't want to have an ""argument"" or ""fight"" with her when all I'm doing is putting up a boundary. 

PS. We even tried dating but it didnt work out and I TOLD her it wouldn't. And of course she got upset when we broke up. She wanted to date me because she said she'd ""do better"" than my exes and didn't give a fuck about how I felt in the relationship. And anytime I tell her about my exes she wonders why I always get with bad people like I'm supposed to know if someone's gonna cheat on me or not.

To give context, our relationship has always been very healthy, very mature and incredibly connected in all areas of the relationship: from feelings, actions, sex and even arguments.

Whenever there's a disagreement, we always reach a compromise and always talk about what we're feeling and not about who’s the blame. Overall, everything is almost perfect. We always tell each other everything. There have never been any secrets! And I feel that he is my soulmate, which for me didn’t exist.
Until one day, while we were talking about past sexual relationships, which I told him all of mine. He told me all of his except who he lost his virginity to. I thought it was very strange, so I asked him why he wasn't telling me. He said and I quoted:
- it's a matter that doesn't just depend on me and to tell you, I have to ask the person involved if it's okay.
I was quite confused since it was something trivial and he shouldn't have to ask anyone anything. It happened right?!
I confronted him with my doubts and he asked me if it was so trivial and unnecessary for me to know why I wanted to know. At the time I told him it was just out of curiosity but I understood that I had made him uncomfortable and he said he was going to talk with the person to tell me.

We've always trusted each other and there's never been any suspicion, so I was very reassured. I can say that I am a really chill person and not jealous at all.

1- our school has a 1 bathroom break per class policy, unless you have an emergency. Not all teachers follow this rule, but most of them do, since its practical. 
2- whenever im sick, my stomach and intestines become, what i call, a mustard gas machine. Its just a funny way of saying, that i get really gassy, and the resulting air that comes out is foul, like rotten eggs mixed with a fermented rat corpse kind of foul. The smell has woken me up while i was sleeping plenty of times, and my sister almost pucked once because she came into my room as i had just farted.

Ive been ashamed to tell peoole about it, and whenever im in a situation, where i feel like a spicy one is coming, i just go outside, and say sorry to mother nature. I carry a small bottle of clothes perfume, to cover the smell, and i just go back in after a few minutes. 
Now, to the events of today. I was feeling better, and went to school. Whenever i felt a fart coming, i asked permission to go to the bathroom, and let the pressure out. Some of my friends noticed i was going to tye bathroom almost every class and during recess, but i just shrugged it off go being sick.

I told her it was an emergency, but she said that she'd spoken with the other teachers, and they said i had already gone to the bathroom in every class including hers, and so whatever emergency i had, i could wait until the bell.

So I (21F) have been with my boyfriend for 8 months now, and my mom has asked me a few times since I got with him if we have had sex or other intrusive questions (like how he is in bed, for example).

I’ve told her not to ask me each time she asks, but it seems like she won’t listen.

There’s a reason why I won’t tell her anything about my life or my sex life: it’s because she’s always judging me.

One day we were talking (I think it was last year), and she asked me if I was still a virgin. I used to avoid the question, but I decided to answer this time. So I told her yes, and that the guy I had my first time with wasn’t my boyfriend. She was so mean about it even though she told me that she wouldn’t judge me for it. She even told me, ""I didn’t think that you were such an easy girl."" She shamed me for it and even brought it up when we argued (which was totally irrelevant in those situations) for at least 2 months.

Since then, I decided that I won’t tell her anything related to sex.

53,1e5pa2b,AITA for telling my nephew’s father he cannot stay at my house with his wife and her kids?,"My nephew “George” lives with me and my family. He is my sister’s child, but she unfortunately passed away a few years ago. Her widower, “Eric” remarried quickly. George didn’t get on with Eric’s wife and kids and Eric paid no attention to him. 18 months ago he came to live with me. 

Eric visits George at our house for one weekend a month, a longer visit during the summer, and we took him to see Eric at Christmas time. All of these visits are without his wife and her children, as the therapist feels it’s important for George and Eric to rebuild their individual relationship. I won’t say facilitating this has been easy. I love George like he’s my own child, and to watch Eric flounder with a child he was supposed to take care of breaks my heart. It’s hard for my husband too. All this to say, we are on a short fuse with Eric, I feel I have to be honest about that. 

Anyway, Eric is meant to be coming to us in August for two weeks. A few days ago, he asked if he could bring his wife and her kids. Apparently she has been having a really tough time and is desperate for a holiday, as are the kids (wtf). Eric also said it’s been a real strain to keep his wife and kids away from his son and splitting time has been hard and he really wants to start mending the relationship between all of them. I was livid, but I went and spoke to my husband, and then to George. George was hurt that his dad was suggesting bringing them, and said that he didn’t want to see them. I went back to Eric and said I couldn’t control where his wife and the kids are, but they won’t be staying with us. If he wants to bring them, they can stay in a hotel and when he is not visiting George he can do what he wants. I made clear that I am upholding what’s been recommended by the therapist George sees (which Eric knows because he has check-ins with the therapist). 

Both Eric and his wife have been up my ass about me not letting them stay. I have not blocked her because I like to collect evidence of what kind of person she is to send to Eric when he tries to act like she is not awful. Eric is saying he might not be able to come at all now because organising childcare for the kids is going to be hard, and his wife is becoming resentful of him not being around, etc. Basically because I’m doing this, George might not see Eric at all for more than a weekend until Christmas.

This is hurting me because Eric has been making a good effort until now. And George had been starting to trust him. I just feel like I’m ruining it. But if I let them all stay then Eric won’t get any one on one time with George anyway (the wife will make sure of that) on top of us all having hellish houseguests. I am trying to enforce this boundary so that Eric has to man up and prioritise his son but maybe I’m being too harsh because it might end up the opposite.

Eric is saying he might not be able to come at all now because organising childcare for the kids is going to be hard, and his wife is becoming resentful of him not being around, etc. Basically because I’m doing this, George might not see Eric at all for more than a weekend until Christmas.

This is hurting me because Eric has been making a good effort until now. And George had been starting to trust him. I just feel like I’m ruining it. But if I let them all stay then Eric won’t get any one on one time with George anyway (the wife will make sure of that) on top of us all having hellish houseguests. I am trying to enforce this boundary so that Eric has to man up and prioritise his son but maybe I’m being too harsh because it might end up the opposite. ",0.0,0.016962159425020218,0,1
54,1e5p9s4,"AITA for asking someone to ""tone it down"" at a musical?","Recently, I (OP - 31F) and my husband (32M) attended an opening night performance of the musical Six in the US (a ""British comedy musical in the style of a pop concert."") Run time is \~90 minutes, no intermission. I have seen this musical before - it gets a bit rowdy with lots of clapping and louder than normal for a musical audience (laughing/cheering). We are in a smaller balcony area with \~20 people (various group sizes). The stranger (S) next to me shares that he has seen this show multiple times and is excited. I share I've seen it 1x and my husband has not yet seen it. I note that S appears intoxicated, but is not disruptive or rude.



Show starts. Opening number is rowdy, with S next to me hooting, hollering, and clapping at max volume. I was equally as excited, so I was glad S could enjoy. Now the musical is going and S is continuously (literally non-stop) clapping at top volume through songs that don't indicate audience participation at that volume. S is cheering loudly over dialogue as well. The row of people in front of us keep turning their heads back and glaring.



I lean over and say(OP in a stage whisper and S at normal volume):

OP: Could you clap a little bit softer? I am having trouble hearing the words over your clapping during this song.

S: It's a concert! The performers love it!

OP: Yes - I know but I am having trouble hearing. You are cheering at a 10, could you drop it to a 9.5?

S: Have you ever been on stage? They love it!

OP: Well no - But I am having trouble hearing right now and I am trying to nicely ask you to bring it back just a little bit.

S: No

OP: I was just asking.



I thought about telling an usher, but I didn't want to miss more of the show. Someone else from the stranger's group leaned over from a different row and tried to ""quiet"" S and his mom who was just as loud (clapping, hollering, crying). S got very defensive and loudly bemoaned we ""ruined his night that he paid $80 for"". S crossed his arms, pouted, and slunk down in his chair. After the next song, S yelled ""BOO"" during a silence in the song meant to build tension, leaned over to me, and said ""that's what you get."" I was confused about the outburst and ignored it. Shortly after, his mom loudly complained that they ""were no longer having any fun"" and ""Let's leave."" She storms out, over my husband and I. S remains sulking for the remainder of the show. I focus on the show and have a good time.



At curtain call, the audience stands to clap (including OP/husband). S throws his arms, like ""look at the rudeness of these people"". My husband nudges me to leave, so there is not another scene with S.



I felt like I was ok to ask for the excitement to be toned down (not stopped) so that I could hear. My husband agreed but added maybe the stranger was neurodivergent. Even if the stranger was neurodivergent, I think I was polite and direct for the venue we were at.

55,1e5p75r,AITA? Wife woke up late for work!,"My wife works today and was to drive two hours away for a photoshoot, my wife is the photographer. 

My car was parked in the driveway and hers was about 600 feet away in an overflow parking lot. We usually leave our wallet and ID in our cars as we don’t need to bring them in the house. so she was late and didn’t want to walk all the way to her car, so she took mine and I attempted to get whatever I needed out of the car but was unable to get my ID as I forgot about it and I need my ID for work today. 

While I don’t expect her to ask permission to use my car, I asked if she was going to take it before it became obvious that she was and she said ‘I don’t have a choice do I’. She leaves and about 30 minutes later I really ID was in the car, for context, I need my military ID to gain access to a military base. When I tell her I need my ID her solution is to use a parking pass to try to gain access to the military base. I don’t expect her to turn around as she would definitely miss her photo shoot but my issue was that she didn’t take any accountability for waking up late, taking my car and putting me in this position where I now can’t go to work. When I express all this to her, her response is “It was your choice to not take your ID out of the car when you were right there. Don’t you dare put any blame on me”. 

She simplifies it to a choice when it was a last minute realization that I had to get all my stuff out of the car and there’s obviously the possibility I could forget something. I’m upset about missing work, but I’m more upset that she’s not taking accountability for how we ended up in this situation. She has sensed stop talking to me because she feels I am talking trash on her or making her out to be someone she’s not. she was aggressive and yelling this morning, which she has apologized for, but she refuses to budge on any other issue that I have with this whole scenario.

56,1e5ofkm,"AITA for excluding one ""friend"" from plans when they have been sabotaging my other friendship? ","so basically I (18F) just started college this year and met my friend group through residence. Beth (19F) was my closest friend out of the group. She also told me that I was the one she was closest to aside from Nancy (19F) who she knew back in high school. 

Nancy and I were never close, as I never felt like we vibed together. I am also pretty introverted so the mutual lack of initiative to get to know each other better kind of distanced me from her compared to the rest of the friend group. 

However, this doesn't mean we were hostile to each other at all! I feel like we were very cordial in a group setting, and could make conversation. She was also very clingy to Beth so when we were all in a group, it felt like I couldn't hang out with my friend without her being involved every second of it. 

During second semester, things became really off. I barely got to see or spend time with Beth anymore. She also started hanging out less with our other friends and alienated herself to just Nancy.

When we did hang out, it was usually always when Nancy was gone. When Nancy found out we were hanging out, she would often argue with Beth, causing her to leave in order to reconcile with her friend. As I learned more about their relationship, it seemed kind of toxic and Beth was under a lot of stress in that relationship. 

Later on, I made plans to go somewhere and I admittedly immaturely didn't invite Nancy. After this all went down, Nancy found out and was really hurt that I excluded her from these plans, especially since it was all her closer friends. At this point, I learned a lot more about the situation. 

Beth and Nancy have been dating since second semester, and Nancy didn't want her girlfriend hanging out with someone who didn't like her. Nancy said that I avoided talking to her directly in group settings and had inside jokes. 

At the time of Nancy alienating me from Beth though, I haven't done anything outwardly mean. I do think I could have tried to include her more in my conversations, but that was genuinely out of awkwardness rather than malice, and I didn't even realize I was doing it. I feel like she could have communicated this with me instead of damaging my relationship to Beth. 

The only thing I was sorry for was not inviting her, and I do feel like it was both because of how she affected my relationship with Beth and immature jealousy.

Beth told me that she was considering dropping one of us because it was too hard, and once I heard that, I instantly distanced myself from her. No matter what happened with Nancy, I was a great friend to Beth, and always supported her when she needed it. 

In the end, I apologized to Nancy, but neither Nancy or Beth actually owned up to their full parts in this situation. It's been a while but I am still wondering if it was mostly my fault, especially with how it was resolved.

To be completely honest Ive always been closer with his gf. We all were from the same program, Devin barely tried, was lazy, and would constantly just ask to see my work. Steph was polar opposite, always on top of her shit and was the go to person within our bigger friend group if you had questions about assignments.

Just last year, I finally landed a decent paying full time salary job. I've been looking for a place for the past few months, and I really want to move out within the year from my parents shitty cramped townhome, where 6 humans currently live,

The problem with this is, it is possible for me to move out, but I would be barely skirting by with living expenses and would most likely be eating the absolute bare minimum, with no extra cash on hand if I were to move out solo

Steph had gotten a job straight after we graduated, Im pretty sure at this point shes making a good amount more than I am. Steph and Devin live together at steph's parent's home.

Devin is unemployed, and still is unemployed. She constantly complains about him to me and the rest of the friend group. Nobody really wants to get involved. I honestly believe hes content with how things are now, I dont think hes going to change or get a job.

A couple days ago steph messaged me letting me know that she was looking in to places, and asked if I wanted to share rent.

She told me that she has already told devin that she is moving out at the end of this year, and if he doesnt get a job by then shes breaking up, kicking him out of her parents place, and moving out regardless. I said yes and now am currently looking for places to rent out with my new shared budget.

Devin confronted me and is angry (obviously), I told him that he knows I've been looking to move out for a long time now.

He said that this is an evil thing to do to someone. I snapped and told him its time to wake up, he isnt a little boy anymore, its time to stop being a bum and lock in lol.

He said that he wasnt going to let me do this, I told him all he has to do is get a job by the end of this year.

61,1e5n914,WIBTA If I Didn't Let My Mother Walk Me Down the Aisle?,"I (22F) am getting married to my fiancé (25M) next April. We are having a very untraditional wedding, think faeries-meet-lightsaber, and I am excitedly planning everything on my own because we have a small wedding budget. My mom (59F) was invited to be a part of the wedding planning to help me out a bit because I am chronically ill and there are things I physically cannot do. This has become a bit of a problem.

As a bit of context, my dad (52M) left when I was three. My mom raised me and my brother alone in an impoverished community, and she always did her best to take care of us. She was a bit controlling, but sometimes when you are a kid you need that sort of structure so I understand looking back. But when I grew up, the controlling aspects of her personality did not stop.

This all came to a bit of a head last year, when my then boyfriend and I moved in together. She insisted that we would never get married if we did this. When we got engaged three months later, she insisted we were taking things too fast. and got VERY angry at me, yelling at me for making the same mistakes she did (she had been married three times). Then, a month later, when her sister found out we were living together, she decided we needed to go ahead and ""get hitched"" so we wouldn't be living in sin (we do not do anything ""out of wedlock"" and are waiting til we are married).

I chocked this up to be my mother being controlling like she always was. I have learned to ignore it for the most part. But she recently has crossed a line. As previously mentioned, I am chronically ill, and I am getting medical tests and am trying to get treatment to mitigate some of the pain and fatigue I currently have. Recently, after a trip to the ER, I called my mom to inform her of what was going on and she insisted that fiancé ""would leave me if I continued to ACT as sick as I do."" She has also mocked every single choice I've made about the wedding that would make the day easier for me (not wearing heels, using a mobility aid, etc).

I was very upset by this as I do not have control over my own body and have been dealing with debilitating symptoms since I still lived with her. She is NOW discussing some very personal parts of my health journey (including my menstrual cycle) with family friends I have not had contact with for years. When I tried to confront her about disclosing such personal details of my health, she insisted she was in the right and that I was just being hateful to her “like I always am since I met fiancé.”

My mother was going to walk me down the aisle while my father was going to officiate, but now I am not sure I want her to talk me down the aisle because she is only causing me stress and grief about my relationship with my mother. I am also not sure who I would get to walk me down the aisle if it wasn't her, but I know that I cannot maintain the relationship as it currently stands so I don't know what to do.

WIBTA if I removed her from this role, or is that going too far?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-17,"WIBTA If I Didn't Let My Mother Walk Me Down the Aisle? I (22F) am getting married to my fiancé (25M) next April. We are having a very untraditional wedding, think faeries-meet-lightsaber, and I am excitedly planning everything on my own because we have a small wedding budget. My mom (59F) was invited to be a part of the wedding planning to help me out a bit because I am chronically ill and there are things I physically cannot do. This has become a bit of a problem.

As a bit of context, my dad (52M) left when I was three. My mom raised me and my brother alone in an impoverished community, and she always did her best to take care of us. She was a bit controlling, but sometimes when you are a kid you need that sort of structure so I understand looking back. But when I grew up, the controlling aspects of her personality did not stop.

This all came to a bit of a head last year, when my then boyfriend and I moved in together. She insisted that we would never get married if we did this. When we got engaged three months later, she insisted we were taking things too fast. and got VERY angry at me, yelling at me for making the same mistakes she did (she had been married three times).

64,1e5mlux,AITA for putting no effort into cooking dinner for my family my one night for cooking?,"In my (15m) family once we turn 12 we're supposed to cook a dinner for everyone once a week. We start out with help but at age 14 it's on us alone to do our one night. So far me, my sister Miley (14f) and my brother Kole (12m) have started. Our younger siblings Shea (10f) and Lincoln (8m) don't cook yet. Of the three of us I'm the only one who likes cooking. I actually took cooking classes before and I go to a summer camp that's focused on cooking. I also cook and bake with my grandparents when we see them. Both of them are really good cooks.

I always tried to make a really nice dinner for us, something we'd really enjoy. My siblings never put any effort in and basically serve whatever. They hate it so I get it. When I started doing something more effort my parents were encouraging. But over time everyone is just so negative about it. My siblings complain that it's not burritos or tacos, but then they all want different kinds which is still more effort, or they want me to make pizzas or burgers. My parents complain about the price, they complain about the time it takes me to cook vs my siblings, they complain I'm trying to look better than them. My siblings complain about veggies I include in what I cook. I made a pasta once and they kept saying it was puke because there were veggies. Miley and Kole need to include veggies too (it's a rule our parents made) but instead of all the whining my siblings just push the veggies aside and refuse to eat them. And my parents praise them for being so fast and cheap.

I asked my parents if they'd be less negative if we decided on a budget for my cooking. They told me yes, so I adjusted what I was cooking to make it work. But they were still negative that I take 10-15 minutes longer and that I'm trying to upstage them in cooking or that I'm showing off.

So I had enough and the last three weeks I put no effort in. I boil veggies, potatoes, and cook meat and I slap it on a plate. Miley and Kole don't add gravy or sauce so neither do I. My parents made such a big deal out of it and told me I'm capable of way better and my siblings complained they're not tacos or burritos. I said I don't want to make ungrateful people happy with my food when I don't have to. Dad said I could never make it as a chef. I said it would be different for people paying for food, especially if I was getting SOME appreciation instead of everyone always complaining now.

65,1e5mfjl,AITA for not telling my pastor brother that my niece was going to bars with her friends,"In early 2024, my brother (49) discovered his daughter (19) had lied about going to a friend's and instead went to a bar and hotel with friends. Though I knew loosely, I didn't see danger; she's 19 and exploring. I did caution her and shared some of my negative experiences.  We've never gone out or drank together.  My goal is to be a trusted adult and friend she can confide in.

When her dad, James, found out, he blamed me for not telling him, feeling very betrayed. He wanted to end our relationship immediately, but I offered to meet with him and his wife so we could discuss and hopefully talk it through.  During this meeting he compared it to seeing my partner with someone else several times and not telling me.  He didn't take responsibility as her parent but instead put the responsibility on me. 

He also accused my best friend (of 28 years) of “leaking” this news to others and asked I immediately contact her to “stop the leak”.  It wasn’t her and I didn’t need to ask her to confirm.  But I agreed to for the sake of our relationship.  He became fixated on this.  I wanted to discuss this with her in person, but James insisted I text her immediately.  He threated to confront her himself.  He’s a large man over 6ft and she’s a petite 5ft and he doesn’t know her.  I’m not even sure he could pick her out in lineup.  I pleaded with him several times not to approach as my friend struggles with anxiety and this would be detrimental for her and to our relationship.  But he would not relent.  I advised him if he approached her, I would go to his place of employment.  This did stop him, but he now tells people I did this over a petty disagreement. 

Also, to “see if he missed something” James allowed two pastors from his church to read out texting convo. And because ""he knows how I feel about bald white men"" (I'm married to one sooooo???) he asked two other women from church to read the conversation as well.  And then asked his son (17M - who isn't involved in any of this) to also read our conversation.  This all feels a lot like manipulation.

My brother James is a youth pastor and has devoted most of his adult life to ministry. This partially explains his intense reaction to what might seem like a typical situation. Ironically, he recently delivered a sermon on handling disagreements with heavenly wisdom. Despite his pastoral role, there's a clear distinction between pastor James and brother James.  Shortly after our meeting, my FIL passed away suddenly.  The very next day, James bombarded me with texts regarding my conversation with my friend. I explained my FIL as died and asked for space and he responded by blocking me from texting, removing me from his Spotify (not my partner, though), and Disney+. Previously, he had gladly shared his accounts as a thank you for all we had previously done for him and his family.

This is about my two daughters. They are a year apart, I will call them Cally and Rebecca. Rebecca was a rough teenager, she would sneak out, steal, lie, had trouble in school, etc. Cally was the opposite, she barely event got in trouble and was an honor student.

Due to Rebecca behavior she lost privileges. When they were both became freshman I allowed them to go places without a parent. Cally was fine alone but Rebecca causes problems usally by stealing.She would lose that privilege and every time she gave her a change to earn trust back she would do soemthing else. This happened for a lot of things, car, trips and so on. It was a circle and when she was 16 we did therapy. 


She hated it and it made it worse. She was very resentful that we were forcing her to go. Rebecca really started to resent cally also because she would do things while she had extra rules and conditions

At 18 she left to live at her aunts. She robbed the place and my sister pressed charges. She almost went to jail and after that she started to turn her life around.

To the main issue, I picked her up and she made some remarks that she should have a car like Cally ( she bought her car from a family member ). I told her she should save up for one. She made a comment about how cally is the golden child and that is why she had a good childhood with opportunity while hers sucked.

I told her no, cally is not the golden child and the reason she had opportunities that you didn't have was because we could trust Cally. As a teenager you proved over and over again thag you were not to be trusted.

For context I have a guy cousin who has a live in partner and they have a toddler, they used to live with us at my aunt's house (his aunt too not his mom) they're both jobless but my cuz used to have a job when they were still living with the girl's family but soon after they moved in with us at my aunt's house my cuz's job contract ended and he didn't bother to look for another job, well he did get a job once after that but as per his usual behavior whenever he gets comfortable with his living arrangements he's usually absent from work and will eventually stop going altogether and I feel like he didn't really bother looking for another job since he doesn't have any bills to pay at all, meals are provided by my aunt and the bills are split between us who have jobs. A month back the girl had a chance to go overseas for work because my mom who's also working abroad got her a job and she paid for her visa and everything and my other cousin ( my aunt's daughter who is residing abroad) helped her with the money for her passport too, everything is already set for her and is supposed to leave probably next month, but.... she got pregnant😅 we don't know exactly if she knew  she was pregnant even before getting her passport coz apparently my other cousins said that she was already hinting at it but she didn't tell right away coz she was feeling guilty that she wasted all the help given to her so eventually she and my cuz left my aunt's house willingly and they went back to her mom's place. Now, the problem is we are going to move out of my aunt's house (we're just renting the house) and be moving in to a house I recently got and my aunt and other cousins will be coming with me (my aunt is like a 2nd mom to me and I've lived with her since I was a kid so it's kinda a given I bring her along😅) and I heard my aunt talking to my mom that the girl apparently texted my aunt saying that she wants to go back and live with us again and when I heard it I immediately said NO! For full transparency the utility bills at my new house will still be split between my cousins and my aunt since I will now have to pay for the house that I got through loan so yes it's not like I will be the one to feed them or anything but I feel like I still have a say since it's my house and other reasons I don't want them there are:
1. Eventually my aunt and other cousins (girls) will move out of the house and I don't want to be left responsible for my guy cus and his gf and two kids
2. Whenever my cuz stays with us he goes back to his old ways of being lazy and will eventually stop going to work since everything is basically provided for them for free
3. I work at night at home so I sometimes go down to the kitchen and want to cook/ move freely in my living room without having to think about waking them up (we dont have extra rooms so they sleep at the living room with a fold up bed)
4. My guy cuz doesn't exactly have a good track record for his behavior, aside from his work issues aka laziness, there was a time when before he got a gf when he will do perverted things to us when he's drunk (fyi we're all girls in the house aside from him and my uncle)
5. He brings his guy friends at home sometimes to drink when my aunt is not at home
6. It's not only just them that will live with us but now they have a toddler and a baby so imagine how much more noisy it would become since we already have a toddler and a baby at home as well
 
Tbh I feel guilty for not wanting them to live with us again, but I just feel like the cons outweighs the pros and also this will help them stand at their own feet instead of relying on us since ever since they got out of the house my guy cuzhad no choice but to look for a job and is now working.

Now, the problem is we are going to move out of my aunt's house (we're just renting the house) and be moving in to a house I recently got and my aunt and other cousins will be coming with me (my aunt is like a 2nd mom to me and I've lived with her since I was a kid so it's kinda a given I bring her along😅) and I heard my aunt talking to my mom that the girl apparently texted my aunt saying that she wants to go back and live with us again and when I heard it I immediately said NO! For full transparency the utility bills at my new house will still be split between my cousins and my aunt since I will now have to pay for the house that I got through loan so yes it's not like I will be the one to feed them or anything but I feel like I still have a say since it's my house and other reasons I don't want them there are:
1. Eventually my aunt and other cousins (girls) will move out of the house and I don't want to be left responsible for my guy cus and his gf and two kids
2. Whenever my cuz stays with us he goes back to his old ways of being lazy and will eventually stop going to work since everything is basically provided for them for free
3. I work at night at home so I sometimes go down to the kitchen and want to cook/ move freely in my living room without having to think about waking them up (we dont have extra rooms so they sleep at the living room with a fold up bed)
4. My guy cuz doesn't exactly have a good track record for his behavior, aside from his work issues aka laziness, there was a time when before he got a gf when he will do perverted things to us when he's drunk (fyi we're all girls in the house aside from him and my uncle)
5. He brings his guy friends at home sometimes to drink when my aunt is not at home
6. It's not only just them that will live with us but now they have a toddler and a baby so imagine how much more noisy it would become since we already have a toddler and a baby at home as well
 
Tbh I feel guilty for not wanting them to live with us again, but I just feel like the cons outweighs the pros and also this will help them stand at their own feet instead of relying on us since ever since they got out of the house my guy cuzhad no choice but to look for a job and is now working.

71,1e5lofk,AITA for not compromising on having an iced tea function in the guest bedroom.,"I (34M) am deeply passionate about coffee and tea; it is a hobby I've spent most of my adult life refining and in short this classy drug addiction means a lot to me.

My wife (35F) literally only drinks water.

We often have guests over who stay in our guest bedroom upstairs and we really try to go out of our way for our guests to make their stay here awesome. Part of this consideration is often morning coffee or tea, which generally speaking I am up to the task of making in anyway they would ever desire.

However, we recognize that a guest might have a slow morning and prefer to drink some coffee or tea without having to come downstairs and present themselves as being awake yet. And as much as I don't prefer a Keurig, I recognize that it gets the job done.

So here is where the petty squabble is.

My wife didn't know this, but originally speaking my goal was just to find a slim/small black keurig machine used on facebook marketplace. There are a ton of them on there, they work fine and they get the job done. But over the night she found a couple different machines on Amazon on sale for prime day.

She presented these options to me this morning

1. Normal slim black one that's simple and pretty much what I was looking for.
2. A large one that also has an iced tea function that she is extremely excited about because she could imagine guests really liking this.

I let her know my original goal was to get a used one, but was willing to compromise and get the first one. 

Her argument was leaning towards the second one because she could see people really enjoying the iced tea/coffee function. My immediate feeling was negative about it because it would require two things. 1. The guest would have to go downstairs to grab ice, and 2. I think the iced function would cause a worse extraction and overall just make bad coffee/tea.

The function works by starting with a high temp, then reducing temp over time in order to reduce ice melt. Which generally speaking isn't great for making good coffee or tea. This frustrates me as someone who cares a lot about coffee and tea, but I also fully recognize I will likely never use this machine and also it's going to be using Keurig pods. But it really bothers me to even have a function that could objectively just make things worse.

After we spoke, we agreed on the first one as my points sounded reasonable enough.

Queue 20 minutes later she had found essentially the same machine as #1, same price, but with the iced function. It's also not in the right color. We've spent the last like 30 minutes arguing about this.

AITA? I mean, I know I am being petty about it. This is a machine I am likely never going to use, but I objectively hate the idea of the function making things worse for guests. Additionally the function feels counterintuitive because the guest would have to come downstairs to even get the ice to begin with. This is an area I am deeply passionate about and is one of my few hobbies as well and is something my wife literally doesn't care about at all.

72,1e5kzlq,AITA For not going on vacation with my family?,"I’m 23. I live in a house with my mom and younger brother that we all split rent on. I just recently had to take a week off sick from work so I’m already down a bunch of leave.

For several weeks now my mom’s been asking about renting a place over in one of the more beachy vacationy parts of our state (US) and asking me what I’d want in the house. Well I’ve answered her very honestly. I’ve been abundantly clear that I’m not sure I want to go on this vacation to begin with. We went a lot as kids and while those are fond and fun memories all the activities in the area that were fun for a kid, or a parent with their kid, just isn’t fun for me as an adult. If I were to drive the 2 hours it would take to get there I’d spend my time mostly just lounging around in the house because there’s not much that I enjoy doing there. Not much of a vacation and I’d have to contribute $500 if I went. 

Then as I mentioned earlier I got sick and had to take a week off work. Well, now I’m definitely not going. The leave I have was just sliced into harshly and I didn’t even want to go in the first place. So, I told my mom as much and she was flabbergasted. She at least took me seriously enough that she didn’t consider what I’d want when she chose the house, but she seemed utterly convinced I was going to change my mind or something and go anyway. She made such a huge deal about it that I straight up offered to pay her the $500 even though I wasn’t going since from my point of view it seemed like she was concerned about the cost. I guess that offer kind of made her realize my adamant position and she calmed down, accepted my choice, and turned down the money.

Nothing more on that front. Things are back to normal with my mom after a short outburst. My brother on the other hand… He’s furious. He’s been all but demanding I go. Even insisting I take leave without pay for vacation and calling me deranged when I said no because “that’s what it’s meant for.” After a lot of arguing I finally got it out of him that because he’s bringing his girlfriend for a few days he doesn’t want our mom to be “undistracted” and pry into their business. I’ve never known my mother to act that way, but my brother doesn’t get along with her regardless so… shrug. He even tried to convince me I should get drunk with her to keep her busy… I barely even drink 1 alcoholic beverage a month.

I’ll be honest… I feel fairly certain this is an open and shut I’m not the @$$hole, but I’ve been wrong before. Did I unknowingly lead on my mother about going?

My brother and Jamie's mom were married but she left when Jamie was 3 months old for another man. She also chose to leave Jamie behind and he never had contact with her or anyone in her extended family. This was not a great surprise. My brother's relationship and marriage to Jamie's mom was not good. They were so bad for each other and fought constantly. My parents took Jamie for a year and my brother got himself together and then took him back.

In the time that has followed my brother married and divorced twice more, had six live in relationships and a daughter with another woman he had a very brief fling with.

My brother met current SIL 18 months ago. They got married because she got pregnant and sped through the relationship, including introducing her and Jamie.

Jamie is not interested in newest SIL or his new half sibling at all. My brother and SIL tried including him in the pregnancy, they tried to get some photos of them, plus my brother's daughter, during the pregnancy and initially after SIL gave birth. But Jamie was very clearly there against his will. He did not want to help pick names. He also went to a friends house the afternoon my brother was planning to bring him and his daughter (who he has one weekend a month custody of) to meet the baby in the hospital. 

Jamie rarely talks to SIL. She has to drag words out of him according to her and my brother. He refused to help her during the pregnancy and ignored my brother's request that he check in on her after school while she was on partial bedrest during the later stages of her pregnancy. He went straight to friends houses after school instead.

My SIL overheard Jamie tell a friend she's not family and he's just waiting for them to get divorced and for his dad to move onto the next woman. He said he'd prefer his dad to date outside the house all the time but at least he's beyond the point of caring about any of them or trying to know them. She told my brother and my brother was furious and grounded Jamie and told him he needs to start treating their family like family. Because he acts like it's only the two of them but he has two siblings. The grounding was extended when Jamie said half siblings, not siblings, and they're not real siblings either.

SIL was present when my brother mentioned all of this to me and the consequences. He was so mad at Jamie. I could see the anger. I told them he was being too hard on Jamie given the history with relationships and wives, it's no surprise Jamie feels like he does and he should try giving it time and proving Jamie wrong rather than punishing him.

I (25M) have this friend, let's call her Sarah (24F), who I've known since college. We've always been pretty close, but she's had a history of being a bit irresponsible and often relies on others for help.

So yesterday morning, Sarah called me in a panic. Apparently, her car broke down while she was on her way to a job interview and she's freaking out because she's already late (of course) and doesn't want to miss it completely. She asked me if she can borrow my car to get there.

Now, here's the thing: I really value my car. It's not just some dump car. It's a vintage that I've put a lot of work into so I'm pretty particular in how I use it. It's not just a means of transportation; it's my pride and joy. So I don't want to drive across town to pick her up, drive her who knows where and wait potentially hours for her interview to be over while I bake in my car.

So, I suggested she call an Uber to get to her interview on time, but she told me she doesn't trust Uber and insisted that me picking her up would be quicker and more reliable anyway. I still said no, explaining that I didn't want to waste a whole day driving her around town.

Sarah got upset and accused me of not being a good friend when she really needed me. She said I was being selfish and that I should understand how important this interview is for her.

I feel bad that she missed her interview, but I also feel like it's unfair for her to expect me to put my life on hold just because she didn't plan properly for such emergencies.

75,1e5jzco,AITA for becoming closer to someone my close friend introduced to me than said close friend?,"I (25F) have this close friend (24F, Tango) who introduced me to her childhood best friend (25F, India). I didn’t know that India & I would vibe so well that we became known as this trio in our larger friend group. Recently, though, Tango’s been getting mad at me & India for being closer friends.

Also, the 3 of us used to live near one another, so hanging out wasn't really an issue, but 2 years ago, Tango moved a couple cities over with her family. India & I supported her, tho we jokingly whined that Tango would be further away. After Tango's move, we still kept in contact with each other. However, when Tango started involving herself more in her partner's group of friends & declining our invites to meet up, I felt a little distance grow among us. 

This went on for a while: India & I would ask Tango to go out with us (or we’d come to her), but she'd decline because she'd be busy w/ new friends or she'd be too tired to go. I won't lie, me & India felt neglected w/ Tango not hanging out with us as much, but I was happy for her that she was making new friends & was fitting in well with her new friends. India & I agreed to not demand more of Tango's time & energy than she was willing to give.

Tbf, India & I weren't totally innocent in all this. In our bigger friend group, there's this member named Ozzy (20M), & he's much closer to me &India than he is to Tango. Ozzy invited us to a close-friend-only outing. India & I went but forgot to mention it to Tango. Tango was sad & said that she felt left out. We apologized cos we didnt wanna impose to Ozzy + he was still shy around us. 

The whole outings excluding Tango ordeal happened some more. India & I got tired of having to explain ourselves to her every time it happens & she gets frustrated with us. Most of the time, the reason why India & I would go out without inviting her is because we went on another friend's invite or knew the people at that hang out were closer to us (IRL) than her. Eventually, India & I would just hide from her and go out & meet up, which made us feel weird & dirty like we were sneaking around behind her back.

Eventually, during an outing India & I had a few days ago, Tango mssged us that she's feeling hurt & left out that India & I r so close & never invite her to come with us (which isn't true, because the last 2 times India & I did hang out, Tango was invited but she didn't reply to our messages). The situation escalated to the point where Tango told another friend of ours abt her perspective on this situation, & they took Tango's side, becoming passive-agg towards India & me.

It’s getting out of hand, so much so that other people are starting to take notice. All because Tango could’ve properly talked to us abt this instead of internalizing and letting it blow up on our faces.

**TL;DR** Close friend introduced me to her childhood best friend but we& became closer to each other, and my close friend is mad to the point that our friend group is falling apart.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-17,"AITA for becoming closer to someone my close friend introduced to me than said close friend? I (25F) have this close friend (24F, Tango) who introduced me to her childhood best friend (25F, India). I didn’t know that India & I would vibe so well that we became known as this trio in our larger friend group. Recently, though, Tango’s been getting mad at me & India for being closer friends.

Also, the 3 of us used to live near one another, so hanging out wasn't really an issue, but 2 years ago, Tango moved a couple cities over with her family. India & I supported her, tho we jokingly whined that Tango would be further away. After Tango's move, we still kept in contact with each other. However, when Tango started involving herself more in her partner's group of friends & declining our invites to meet up, I felt a little distance grow among us. 

This went on for a while: India & I would ask Tango to go out with us (or we’d come to her), but she'd decline because she'd be busy w/ new friends or she'd be too tired to go. I won't lie, me & India felt neglected w/ Tango not hanging out with us as much, but I was happy for her that she was making new friends & was fitting in well with her new friends. India & I agreed to not demand more of Tango's time & energy than she was willing to give.

Tbf, India & I weren't totally innocent in all this. In our bigger friend group, there's this member named Ozzy (20M), & he's much closer to me &India than he is to Tango. Ozzy invited us to a close-friend-only outing. India & I went but forgot to mention it to Tango. Tango was sad & said that she felt left out. We apologized cos we didnt wanna impose to Ozzy + he was still shy around us. 

The whole outings excluding Tango ordeal happened some more. India & I got tired of having to explain ourselves to her every time it happens & she gets frustrated with us. Most of the time, the reason why India & I would go out without inviting her is because we went on another friend's invite or knew the people at that hang out were closer to us (IRL) than her. Eventually, India & I would just hide from her and go out & meet up, which made us feel weird & dirty like we were sneaking around behind her back.

76,1e5jrwn,AITA for not sitting next to my BIL at the doctor?,"So I (20F) had gone to the doctor for a yearly check up. I knew my sister (29f) and BIL (29M) were going to be there due to them having their own appointment. 

I had walked in to the doctors office and saw my BIL sitting by himself so I said hi and asked if my sister had already gone back. He said yes and he was just waiting for her to come out again. I go check in and was told I had to fill out some paperwork and they will call me back in a few minutes and if I don’t finish the paperwork by then I can take it with me and give it to the nurse. I sat down to fill it out when my sister comes back out. She has to stay for a it for observation due to the test she took so they were talking over in the corner where they sat. She asked me why I was sitting away from them and I told her I was doing paperwork. My BIL being the jokester he is said she thinks I stink so she’s sitting over there. At this point, I had finished the paperwork and hadn’t been called back yet so I go talk to them until I’m called back. 

I get done with my appointment, I see they are still there when I come out and I say bye and wish them a good day.

I get off work and I get message from my sister saying she still can’t believe I did that to her husband. I ask what do you mean and she starts saying that me not sitting by her husband at the doctors office was rude and disrespectful of me and that it clearly shows what type of relationship I want to have with them. She stated that if I had of seen my friends I would have sat with them but the fact that I use doing paperwork as an excuse is disgusting of me and we are no longer sisters. 
I said I had to do the paperwork and I didn’t know I had offended or hurt anyone by not sitting next to you at the office. I told her we were there for different things and I didn’t think it mattered. I also didn’t want him potentially seeing my paperwork due to it being a private matter and she said that he’s my brother and he has the right to know what’s going on with me just like she does. I told her no and left it at that. 

Now she is bombarding my mother and father with phone calls and messages trying to get them to side with her. They tell her we are both adults and we have to work it out. If we don’t then so be it. She tried to get my dad to say he would sit next them because she asked him if he saw them in public if he would go sit with them and he said he probably wouldn’t due to being there for different reasons. She’s now mad at him to and we just don’t know what to do anymore. Any advice would be appreciated. ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-17,"AITA for not sitting next to my BIL at the doctor?

79,1e5jixv,AITA for snapping at the new candidate attorney? ,"I am a 26(M) currently employed at a small firm as a paralegal. I have been working for roughly 8 years. I have seen newly graduated candidates come and go from the firm and I have helped each of them get through their 2 year articles. I would like to say that I have quite a lot of legal knowledge with respect to South African law and I currently manage over 60 files on my own. Of course due to my lack of a degree, all my work is run through my principle before anything is served or sent off. (just for context, candidate attorneys are students who have just graduated law school and have to complete 2 years of articles before becoming a lawyer).



Now this is a small firm, we are only 3 people in the office including my principle. I manage high profile clients whilst a candidate manages all other clients. We will name this candidate Bob (28M). Bob is about to leave the firm as his articles are coming to an end. My principle interviewed a few people and settled with a fairly old graduate who we will name Joe (29M). Joe is to take over all of Bobs files within 3 months. It isn't a hard process and usually every new candidate picks it up, if they don't i always assist them so they get a better foot then any other candidate that is thrown in the deep end. I have had no issues with any candidates until Joe.



Joe has been working for 1.5 months, and he is VERY forgetful. He forgets to send emails, forget to write down hearing dates, dresses sloppy and is always in the mood to talk about anything except the files he is working on. He always talks about how much he knows about law and that he studied at an extremely prestigious university. His drafting is not good at all and I always fix up his mistakes in letters and other documents, whilst calmly and i would believe nicely telling him what his errors are. To which he pays no attention.



I normally keep calm, and still show him where he went wrong. Until yesterday. Whilst i was explaining how he made several errors in a letter, that his grammar was incorrect and that he should keep to the legal jargon, he told me ""I have a degree from (prestigious university name) with distinctions whilst you are a para legal, and nothing to your name"". Something in me triggered and I went off on him. I picked up every file he had been working on and showed him every single error he made. Whilst doing this i kept telling him how stupid and useless he is, that he boasts about being so smart and qualified but can not do simple letters without making a mistake. And that someone without a degree is doing much better than him. I took his laptop and begun deleting every document i sent him and every template/ precedent and told him to figure it out on his own.

My partner has a day off every week to care for our child (‘Ted’).  I agreed to swap a day with him this week when I had Ted so he could go into work for a meeting.  He forgot that he had swapped with me and got a bit agitated when he started talking about a meeting the next day and I replied asking why he was working as it was his day of childcare.  I asked him what he was going to do and he said leave it with me, a call was mentioned which he had to be on for an hour, I agreed to have Ted but that my call started straight afterwards and would need him to take him back.  

The morning started and my husband got Ted out of his crib and took him for breakfast while I was working upstairs.  I came down and saw he was feeding Ted his breakfast while on his laptop, he said he needed to prepare for his meeting.  I said ‘you’re not going to be working much longer though are you?’  He told me I was overwhelming him and to leave him be.  I took Ted while he had his meeting and of course his meeting overran making me late for mine by 5 mins, which he didn’t see what the big deal was when I was flapping my arms to hurry him along.  

My husband was still on his laptop an hour later and Ted was on the floor playing with toys but largely not being interacted with.  I asked when he was stopping working and he ignored me, I looked at Ted who had a dog chew in his mouth - I was really annoyed and raised my voice to say that this was unacceptable and he couldn’t look after a child and work.  

I again asked when he’d finish working and he told me he wouldn’t talk to me while I was raising my voice and to go out and come back in in a minute and he would tell me what he was doing.  I went out and came back and he said that it wasn’t a minute, put his laptop down then went upstairs. He came back down dressed to go out with his bag and I asked what he was doing, he ignored me.  It looked like he was leaving the house and I was still holding Ted, in a panic I called my mum to ask her to take Ted in the afternoon and explained what had happened. My husband got really angry at me and said I’d crossed a line.

Husband is saying it’s my fault he had a dog chew in his mouth because I distracted him and he was ignoring me because I was being hysterical.  He thinks it’s fine to work while looking after Ted and will do it again if he has to.  

Husband is convinced I have postpartum depression and I’m currently awaiting a referral - he puts most of our arguments down to this so I just want to sense check am I overreacting and is it OK to work for an hour or two on a laptop while caring for a child under 1 (crawling but not walking).

TL;DR I swapped childcare days with husband who then forgot his turn and worked half the day while caring for the child ",Everyone Sucks,2024-07-17,"AITA for expecting my husband to put his laptop down when caring for our child? I (38F) and my husband (40M) have a child under 1.  My partner has a day off every week to care for our child (‘Ted’).  I agreed to swap a day with him this week when I had Ted so he could go into work for a meeting.  He forgot that he had swapped with me and got a bit agitated when he started talking about a meeting the next day and I replied asking why he was working as it was his day of childcare.  I asked him what he was going to do and he said leave it with me, a call was mentioned which he had to be on for an hour, I agreed to have Ted but that my call started straight afterwards and would need him to take him back.  

The morning started and my husband got Ted out of his crib and took him for breakfast while I was working upstairs.  I came down and saw he was feeding Ted his breakfast while on his laptop, he said he needed to prepare for his meeting.  I said ‘you’re not going to be working much longer though are you?’  He told me I was overwhelming him and to leave him be.  I took Ted while he had his meeting and of course his meeting overran making me late for mine by 5 mins, which he didn’t see what the big deal was when I was flapping my arms to hurry him along.

84,1e5iloe,AITA for not doing my (24m) girlfriend's (26f) laundry?,"A little background: I'm a pretty tidy person but not super anal about it. I was just raised being told ""If you take something out, put it back when you're done"" just general cleanliness. I always had to clean my own room and do my laundry growing up. My girlfriend's mom has always done all of her chores for her, even when we started dating almost 5 years ago and she was in college her mom would organize her bedroom and fold her clothes for her during holiday and summer breaks. 

We lived together with 3 other roommates for over a year and they were not clean at all. We both got tired of cleaning up after them and feeling like anything we did was immediately undone so we kind of gave up on chores, but agreed that when we got our own place we'd stay on top of things. We've had our own place for 2 years now and she does even less now than she did at the old place. One thing in particular she told me was ""When we live alone you'll never have to worry about laundry because I actually really enjoy folding clothes.""  I'm not exaggerating when I say she's washed and folded both of our laundry at most 5 or 6 times in the two years we've lived alone together. 

She'll wash clothes sometimes then leave them in the baskets on the floor of our bedroom and won't say anything but just waits for me to fold them. If I don't touch them they'll just sit there for months until she's picked through and wore everything inside it again. There was a good streak of like 6 months or so where I washed and folded all of our clothes at least once a week and really kept up on it, but I would fold hers and ask her to put them away because she has 2 closets and 2 dressers and has a place for everything so it's best if she puts them away so things can go where she likes. But she wouldn't put them away and they'd just sit on the floor and she would grab clothes from the pile to wear until it was gone. It made it pointless for me to even fold them for her. 

So recently our one dirty clothes hamper broke and I bought a two pack to replace it, one for her clothes one for mine. I figured if we're just in charge of our own clothes there's no reason to get upset with the other person. Just yesterday I washed and folded my own clothes and didn't touch hers (including the two baskets full of her clean clothes that have been on the floor for the last month) and she just sent me a huge text about how that hurts her feelings and that she does so much, her examples were that she tidied the house for her friend to spend the weekend 2 weeks ago and scooped the litter box. 

It's not a competition I just feel like cleaning up our own stuff would avoid any arguments but instead it's causing more? I just don't get it, if she washed and folded her clothes and didn't touch mine I wouldn't be upset I'd be proud that she did a chore.

86,1e5hxze,AITA for reducing my gift giving to my friends ,"I (35F) have always been an enthusiastic gift giver, I enjoy looking for and putting together thoughtful fun gifts and making people happy. It’s also a part of my culture and my wider family culture, everyone treats each other with generous gifts and it strengthens our bonds.

My friends Hayley and Kara (both 34F) never been this way and that’s fine, how I or my family is isn’t an expectation on others. I’ve always done my gift giving to them to same standard I do for everyone, putting lots of thought and effort, when it’s a bigger occasion making a hamper of carefully chosen items rather than just one item.

Of course gifting isn’t something you do to with expectation to get something in return but after over 20 years I started to feel a bit odd from the way things were playing out as Hayley and Kara wouldn’t even give me a birthday present or even a card, or when I had a difficult surgery get a bunch of flowers when visiting, when it’s Christmas I’d give homemade cookies gift boxed and would get nothing from them. When I’d go on holiday I’d get them a souvenir but when I asked one of them to get me chocolate from Belgium she got me nothing, stared blankly when I asked but kept talking about how much chocolate she bought herself. 

They have given some small gifts over years but few and far between. Also, they’re both financially comfortable with high earning jobs. They both also talk about gifting their family, especially Kara who constantly talks about buying birthday gifts for everyone in her life. 

I’m also aware that “over gifting” can be inappropriate and make people uncomfortable if they don’t feel they can do the same. I’ve never got that impression as they act so excited when I gift and love the experience, but I still feel the above is relevant if they’re not reciprocating. 

Due to this I decided to tone down my gifts to them and carry on as I was with family and friends who practice the same. I’ll still gift them regardless of whether they do, so still me doing more, but I won’t be doing so much effort. So for an occasion I’d normally make hamper just a gift bag with couple of items, if I’d normally give a large item and flowers, giving a smaller item and no flowers, and if I’d normally give a homemade decorated cake I spend whole day on just a small shop one instead etc.

Hayley recently got a house and my natural instinct would be a beautiful house warming hamper for this, it felt strange to not do this and give couple of items in gift bag and flowers, but I had to be firm with myself. I was still recovering from surgery for which Hayley visited me empty handed and my partner said it’d be ridiculous if I then put myself out shopping and lavishing her with beautiful gifts. 

There’s been other occasions I’ve toned down gifts and they’ve both expressed surprise, disappointment and comments that I’m not giving my usual beautiful gifts anymore.

The youngest loves football and is always out in the garden playing it, sometimes alone, sometimes with his dad. 

The issue I have is that very regularly the ball comes over into our garden, and although we always throw them straight back if we are there or as soon as we see them, the kid has started coming over the fence into our garden to fetch them. The fence if only 3ft high at one end so it is really easy to climb. His dad has seen him do it and even lifted him over a few times. 

There are a few reasons that we dislike this. 

1. We only replaced the fence a few months ago so dont want it damaging by constantly being climbed on.

2. We are having building work done to our house so the garden is a building site and there are hazards everywhere, it’s not a child friendly area, plus there are materials being stored close to the fence that we don’t want damaging. 

3. Whilst having the building work done we are living in a caravan in the garden. When the kid comes into our garden he is walking right near the caravan thus invading our privacy.

89,1e5hg79,AITA for telling my friend I can’t attend her birthday event if my emotionally abusive ex would be there?,"I (F28) dated an emotionally abusive narcissist (M28) for nearly 3 years before we eventually had an ugly breakup early 2023. He would boast about being the most successful/smartest person he knew (including me), would belittle major achievements (getting into grad school) and chastised me about my body, being in therapy, taking anti-depressants and anything else under the sun. He would scream, slam doors, lecture me for hours and gaslight me to the point where I started having memory lapses. My self esteem was slowly stripped away and I’ve been left with years of trauma to process.

Of course there were a lot of good times, most of them being with his best friend and his best friend’s wife (we’ll call them Bob and Linda, early 30s). Linda and I got close over the years as we were all constantly having date nights and took several trips together. We eventually started hanging out just the two of us. Throughout the breakup, she was a ride or die and made sure I knew it in no way affected our friendship. I’m good friends with Bob as well but always painfully aware that he’s my ex’s best friend. 

Last week, Bob sent out an invite for a beach day for Linda’s birthday. I checked the guest list and my ex was also invited. I texted Linda and told her since he’ll likely be there, I wouldn’t be able to make it. Instead, I’d love to take her out to dinner just the two of us. She agreed and said she hopes one day I could be around him but didn’t push the issue. Bob texted me shortly after saying Linda really wants me there and he hopes I’ll reconsider because I’m important to both of them. I politely told him my mind was made up. I saw Linda that Friday and confirmed again in person that missing the event was okay and she said it was but worries about bigger events like a potential baby shower. Her and Bob have been trying to conceive for years and I reassured her that there was nothing in the world that could keep me from coming to her baby shower, even if it were co-ed

I’d previously told Bob I’d come to theirs for Sunday dinner the same weekend but was not aware of the talking to I’d get. He told me that him and Linda don’t even see me as being associated with my ex anymore, that my ex has moved on and doesn’t talk about it anymore, and that there’s no reason to believe attending the same event would cause any issues. Bob and Linda don’t know everything our relationship but they know PLENTY. Linda eventually told him to drop it when he persisted to the point of me being in tears. I told him it was frustrating that I’m moved on romantically but that I still have years of emotional abuse to work through 

The whole “talk” felt like Bob was saying everyone else had moved on and questioned why I couldn’t as well. Part of me feels like I should just deal with it and attend the event while knowing that seeing my ex not having a care in the world after traumatizing me would set me back months. Another part is wondering if true friends would ever ask this of me

AITA? ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-17,"AITA for telling my friend I can’t attend her birthday event if my emotionally abusive ex would be there? I (F28) dated an emotionally abusive narcissist (M28) for nearly 3 years before we eventually had an ugly breakup early 2023. He would boast about being the most successful/smartest person he knew (including me), would belittle major achievements (getting into grad school) and chastised me about my body, being in therapy, taking anti-depressants and anything else under the sun. He would scream, slam doors, lecture me for hours and gaslight me to the point where I started having memory lapses. My self esteem was slowly stripped away and I’ve been left with years of trauma to process.

Of course there were a lot of good times, most of them being with his best friend and his best friend’s wife (we’ll call them Bob and Linda, early 30s). Linda and I got close over the years as we were all constantly having date nights and took several trips together. We eventually started hanging out just the two of us. Throughout the breakup, she was a ride or die and made sure I knew it in no way affected our friendship. I’m good friends with Bob as well but always painfully aware that he’s my ex’s best friend. 

Last week, Bob sent out an invite for a beach day for Linda’s birthday. I checked the guest list and my ex was also invited. I texted Linda and told her since he’ll likely be there, I wouldn’t be able to make it. Instead, I’d love to take her out to dinner just the two of us. She agreed and said she hopes one day I could be around him but didn’t push the issue. Bob texted me shortly after saying Linda really wants me there and he hopes I’ll reconsider because I’m important to both of them. I politely told him my mind was made up. I saw Linda that Friday and confirmed again in person that missing the event was okay and she said it was but worries about bigger events like a potential baby shower. Her and Bob have been trying to conceive for years and I reassured her that there was nothing in the world that could keep me from coming to her baby shower, even if it were co-ed

I’d previously told Bob I’d come to theirs for Sunday dinner the same weekend but was not aware of the talking to I’d get.

90,1e5h5qo,AITA for calling out a friends hygiene?,"I wouldn’t bring this to Reddit if nothing else has worked

I part time live with my partner, who lives with our friends. It’s been a great arrangement except for one issue. One of the housemates smells like something died. I’ve noticed that he only washes dishes with water and no soap, this leads me to think he does a similar thing with showering. I’ve tried asking my partner if the friend is hypoallergenic and can’t use most soaps. He isn’t. He doesn’t use any form of deodorant/body spray either. 

It’s gotten to the point where other people have asked us to tell him to shower or do something fix the smell. He’s been offered deodorant and turned it down even after people have insisted by saying “No, really. Please use it.” To which he said he likes his ‘natural scent’
He often naps and spends time in communal areas and those areas now reek. I hold my breath going past his bedroom. He’s a lovely guy but makes the communal areas into b/o hazards. 

I’m trying not to sound so harsh but I can’t be near this guy and I’m not overly sensitive to smell. I need to tell this guy he absolutely stinks and it’s affecting his friendships and potential career (a very social career) but have no clue how?

What do I do? (Yes, I’ve sprayed him with Frebreze before)

91,1e5h5hx,AITA for picking two restaurants for me and my partner to visit,"The context to this is that me (30M) and my partner (28F) played sweepstake between the both of us on who would win the recent Euros football tournament. We split the teams evenly via a randomised generator and decided that whoever won the bet would be able to pick a restaurant they wanted to go to and the loser would pay for dinner. For clarification, there was never a price limit set at the time or any other parameters. 

On Sunday, Spain won the Euros which happened to be one of my teams. As a result, I started thinking about restaurants I’d like to visit. Ultimately, I landed on two separate restaurants, both of which I have wanted to try for a long time. When I told my partner my two options, she was clearly annoyed at the options I selected. 

The reason she was frustrated with restaurant number 1 is because it is ‘expensive’ and you cannot book. At this restaurant, there is a set menu which is £31pp and for that you get a starter salad, then a main of steak and frites which they then come round and do a second serving of. Personally, I think that is good value, however my partner has a smaller appetite so likely wouldn’t take advantage of the second portion. Importantly, you also cannot book this restaurant, so it does require arriving early and potentially queuing for up to an hour. However, it’s summer so unlikely to rain, and there is a pub opposite which serves takeaway pints which you can have in the queue.

The reason she was frustrated with restaurant number 2 is because, although being reasonably priced (about £15-17 for a main), it is an hour and a half away from our flat. 

I’d like to know - AITA for picking these restaurants? Whilst I appreciate they have inconvenient aspects to them, I personally do not feel that £31pp in central London is particularly expensive given the amount of food you get and the quality of it according to reviews. Whilst I also appreciate the second restaurant is a long distance away, I feel that given the sweepstake was to choose a restaurant of your choice and that I’ve wanted to try both of them for a long time, they are reasonable to choose and fall within the parameters.

92,1e5guo2,AITA for not coming to my friend‘s gender reveal party?,"Hi Reddit,

almost one year ago, I (f24) moved for college approx 2hour ride by car from home, my friend (f22) Lisa who I’ve known for almost 3 years now still lives in my hometown.

In the begining of May, she asked me and another friend Meg who moved a bit farther to come to her birthday party in the end of May. I told her I can’t guarantee it as I might have to work but I will try to come. Meg took that weekend off from work and planned a trip home. 

A week before the party was supposed to be , Meg asked if anyone is free to hangout that weekend because she planned to go home and now nothing is happening. I was very confused but said I was free as I went home anyway. In the conversation in the group I realised that Lisa cancelled her birthday party without telling me. (She told Meg two weeks in advance but Meg couldn’t change her plans as she was visiting other family at home too)

I never said yes to coming to her party because we didn’t talk about it afterwards but I would have expected her to tell me the change of plans. When I mentioned that to her in text, she said as she is going to have a gender reveal party in July anyway, she thought she would just do one party. (She is not the social type and tends to keep to herself and her bf) She thought I wasn’t coming anyway so I guess there was a miscommunication in her thinking I wouldn’t attend when I said I wasn’t sure yet. 

So she then invited me to her gender reveal party in the beginning of July. I said I would try to come again but then I didn’t go after all and tbh cancelled very last minute (2days in advance)

here is the thing: the last 4 months I have been home a lot to help my parents on the weekends on our farm as we had new puppies. I also told her and her bf that I was home so they can just lmk if they wanted to hang out but they never really texted me or anything so I figured they were not interested in meeting me. 

Now the party was a bummer as a lot of people were not able to attend and I feel bad for not going. I think it was only 5 people attending when she invited 15. I could have driven home but I could not be bothered tbh. I know 2 hours isn’t that long but after the birthday party thing I didn’t feel like she cared that much about me attending anyway. She said she understood I couldn’t come but I think she was disappointed by the outcome.

93,1e5gucu,AITA for how I reacted when my parents surprised my 16 year old little sister with a new car for her birthday after she finished her cancer treatment but bought me a $25 gift card and a book for mine which was just two weeks later?,"My sister was diagnosed with with cancer last year. It has been hard on our family and even harder on her. I love my sister and I tried to be there for her as best as I could. I also did everything I could to make things easier for my parents. I took over all chores, cooked everyday, cleaned the house, did laundry, took care of my younger sibling and babysat them more.

Luckily she is doing really well and has recently finished her treatment which is great and we are all grateful. Our birthdays are two weeks apart and hers was two weeks ago. My parents bought her a new car to celebrate after everything she went through which I understand, she does deserve it but I was a bit surprised because I thought they didn't have any money. My dad has been unwilling to help me get a used car since last year telling me that they do not have the money. 

I didn't even want him to pay for all of it, I have been saving up and just wanted them to help me with the rest but he kept telling me that they have no money for that. Well my birthday just rolled around and my parents bought me a book that I mentioned in passing and a $25 take out gift card to a place I like. I thanked them but they saw that I wasn't too thrilled and asked me what was wrong. 

I told them that while I appreciate the gifts, I thought that they were finally going to help me with the remaining $800 for buying the used car seeing that they could now afford a new car for my sister. But that's when they accused me of being jealous of my sister who had just gone through something very traumatic and that I was trying to make everything about me and why couldn't just be happy for her. They said that at the end of the day I have a job and could just continue saving. Am I the asshole?

94,1e5gqio,AITA for only having my bio sister in my wedding party and not including any step or half siblings even with offers to pay?,"I (27m) am getting married to my fiancée Millie (27f) in a few months. Millie's amazing and because of her we have everything planned fast which is why this is a topic of discussion now. So I asked my sister India (26f) and my best friend/future BIL (when he marries India) Ryder (27m) to be my groomspeople. India is technically my best person but they're sharing everything since it's just the two of them. Millie asked her three best friends to be her bridespeople which includes a guy best friend. Because I asked India and Millie asked a guy best friend to be in our direct wedding parties, my stepfamilies are having a field day over me asking India but none of my step or half siblings.

My parents are divorced. Both remarried. My stepfather and mother have a toxic on and off relationship. He has three kids from before they met, two from after, and they have two together. For the last 9 years they have been a little more solid and no breakups. Still toxic. My stepmother is a c\*nt and I hate the woman, so does India. There's little to no relationship with her judgemental ass. She had two sons before she met my dad. She and my dad have five more children together. Of all ""the siblings"" I only give a shit about India. The others aren't to blame for the shitshow the parents created but I was never close to any of them, and there's no bond. So I don't plan to give them any jobs at the wedding. They're guests and nothing more. Same for both my parents and their spouses.

Some of the step and half siblings are upset, hurt, angry or offended at not being included in the wedding party. Especially my stepmother's two sons, they feel like they're the more obvious choice over India for being dudes. But some of the girls are also just like, if India can do it why not them as well.

I have made it clear nobody else is being asked. My stepfather told me he'd pay for me to include all his kids and I said no. Dad offered to pay for the wedding reception if I asked all the ""siblings"" on his side. Answer was also no. Mom told me they would gift us a honeymoon or whatever we want for their side and again no. Stepmother called me a dick and told me to think of etiquette and social standing. I told her to fuck off with her social standing. I don't give a shit about it. She called me vulgar. I said they can't buy people into the wedding.

I was told by several of the people involved that I'm excluding family, harming family harmony (there is none and never was) and I should think of the younger kids especially and how sad they'll be to not be counted as a sibling during the wedding when only India is involved. I asked my mom and dad if they really wanted their younger kids and stepkids included by force when none of them are wanted in the wedding. I asked was that really what they were going for. They were both angry at me for describing it that way. Which maybe was too harsh but no less true. Eloping is not what Millie and I want, which I know will be suggested.

95,1e5fyxy,AITA for “speeding” in my neighborhood?,"So for some context, I have a lowered 1999 NB Miata, that is red. I pulled in from a main street into our residential area, being in 2nd gear at a higher RPM at about 17 MPH. (Speed Limit, 25 MPH) And a neighbor a few houses down from me, starts yelling at me, pointing at me with his fingers, and has a huge dog with him. I get a little spooked as he starts approaching me. At this point in time, I had no clue he was even my neighbor or who he was, so I drove off, going over 25 as I got spooked.  So yes, here I did technically speed off when I was spooked, unfortunately I do not know exactly how fast I went but most likely 30 or 35 MPH. I go around the neighborhood trying to get into my house again, and this time he is still there and walks into the street, as I am now driving under the speed limit, trying to block me off, yelling at me I know where you live over and over again. I get spooked again as I have some tall man, trying to block my car with his huge dog yelling at me telling me “I know where you live”. I drive off again leaving my neighborhood this time and wait about 10 minutes. He then walks to my house, and proceeds to knock on the door for about 5 minutes, ( the only way I know this is because I have cameras), then he leaves. 

After he leaves, I wait another 10 minutes, and then pull into my neighborhood again and by this time he is gone. As I get home, about 30 minutes later, police show up as I am guessing he called the cops on me. We talk and the cop says they’re just addressing a complaint they heard and say for the next week or so there will be a traffic unit patroling this area, but we are not accusing you of anything, and it seems more like a interpersonal problem more than anything. And they say they are hoping nothing else comes up, but say they get a lot of these complaints as many people think sports cars or trucks are going faster than they really are just due to the attention they bring. Mind you I’ve never had an issue with this neighbor before. According to my family members, this neighbor has a loud motorbike, much louder than my car, and my other family members have seen him speeding down our street too. Which to me, makes no sense why he is trying to enforce speeding rules when he is speeding himself, with a loud motorbike. I am just wondering, I know I sped off when I got spooked even though I shouldn’t have, so am I the asshole? 

Edit: Sorry, I realize my explanation was slightly messy. But for some better context, I did not know at all what he wanted until the cops told me they had a complaint of speeding. My neighbor did not say anything about speed, but rather just pointed at me, repeatedly yelling at me I know where you live, and was trying to be aggressive with me. This is the first time this has ever happened to me, and we did not have issues before, frankly I had no clue of his existence before this. I do not know why he did it, but it seems like he may have thought I’ve been speeding before or something. However I do not speed, as I stated in the comments, my house is close to the main road so there isn’t really time for me to speed as if I did I would literally pass my house. And no, I do not go up and down my street like a drag strip, it’s a residential area. Thank you for the comments though, I think I will just take it even slower for these next few days, although I am not even sure how much slower I can go when I am already going below 25 MPH.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-17,"AITA for “speeding” in my neighborhood?

According to my family members, this neighbor has a loud motorbike, much louder than my car, and my other family members have seen him speeding down our street too. Which to me, makes no sense why he is trying to enforce speeding rules when he is speeding himself, with a loud motorbike. I am just wondering, I know I sped off when I got spooked even though I shouldn’t have, so am I the asshole? 

Edit: Sorry, I realize my explanation was slightly messy. But for some better context, I did not know at all what he wanted until the cops told me they had a complaint of speeding. My neighbor did not say anything about speed, but rather just pointed at me, repeatedly yelling at me I know where you live, and was trying to be aggressive with me. This is the first time this has ever happened to me, and we did not have issues before, frankly I had no clue of his existence before this. I do not know why he did it, but it seems like he may have thought I’ve been speeding before or something. However I do not speed, as I stated in the comments, my house is close to the main road so there isn’t really time for me to speed as if I did I would literally pass my house. And no, I do not go up and down my street like a drag strip, it’s a residential area. Thank you for the comments though, I think I will just take it even slower for these next few days, although I am not even sure how much slower I can go when I am already going below 25 MPH.",0.0,1.0501242876052856,1,0

From then on I’d only see my mom twice a year during breaks. The problem came up towards the end of my senior year. I applied to multiple colleges but only got accepted to a few.

97,1e5fu5f,AITA for arguing with a junior colleague ,"For context, I am a year into my job, started as an intern then moved my way up to permanent. My colleague/friend started as an intern but left for uni after whilst I stayed. 

She came back this summer along with three other interns and her role was to handle social media bits. I am also on the social team so it’s one of my responsibilities to make sure everything is going smoothly.

I organised a meeting with my friend and the three other interns. It was meant to be a coffee and catchup to help them settle in to the company and for them to be able to ask any advice from me as someone who’s been there and done that. My meeting before this catchup had ran over and I had lost my notebook so I was a bit late. I then told my colleague, make a plan of where to go to get coffee whilst I go to the toilet.

As I’m walking into the toilet I hear “we’re leaving without you” and the doors shut. My “friend” had just left with the other interns whilst I was peeing. I came out to look for them but realised they had in fact gone.

When my friend came back she came to talk to me about some other work. I explained, it was my meeting and you left without me. She then raised her voice a bit and blamed me for my lack of enthusiasm and communication which made her think I didn’t want to be there. This is my bad, I should’ve made it clear that I wanted to be there but I thought it was a prerequisite of organising a meeting. Plus it’s work, I’m not required to be enthusiastic all the time.

She then left saying it’s my fault. I texted her later that evening saying I felt disrespected and she would never do that to another permanent  member of staff. She proceeded to reply with a long paragraph outlining how bad my communication is, how I lack respect for her, how I don’t pay enough attention to my work and how it is my fault again.

For context, my colleague and I have known each other for a year and text very often outside of work. 

I then replied quite angrily (my fault and I regret) saying how I’m not required to satisfy her need for enthusiasm and that no other intern would take over meetings. It’s been hard for me to get respect from her as a worker as we’re friends outside of work. Or were. 

We have always hand a relationship of bantering each other and since she’s come back she has found it hard to accept that I am serious about what I do. From the minute she came she made fun of my breakup (saying I talk about it too much), she has called me boring, she has made fun of my clothes and my height and size. I do not have this kind of relationship with anyone else at work. I am quite well liked in the company and I have good rapport with everyone.

Am I the asshole for feeling like I’ve been disrespected?  

She has escalated the issue to her manager. I just think as someone who’s only here for a matter of weeks should have a certain level of humbleness towards someone who does this day in day out. I shouldn’t have texted and I lost a friend but I also look like an intern can boss me around.

I (17F) have always been super insecure w/my body and shit like that bc my mom used to make really fucked up comments to my face. When i was a kid i was a really picky eater and she was always telling me i was too skinny and it didn’t look good. I was literally in kindergarten. 

Fast forward ten years and I developed binge eating disorder. I gained almost 30 lbs in three months and I weighed 180 and I’m 5’5.5” Then my mom started talking about how big I was getting and how i was finally being “healthy” I was the furthest thing from healthy I was obese.

Sometime during my senior year i developed a restrictive eating disorder and started eating ~800 calories a day i dropped like 50 lbs in under 1/2 a year. 

After this i started getting really angry and pissed off at my mom bc I took a test to get me diagnosed w/something for a 504 in high school. She told me i didn’t have any underlying mental problems. I recently found out that she lied to me and i actually got diagnosed with panic disorder and other cringe mental problems.

I was livid bc i went crying to her all the time about how i wish i knew what was was wrong w/me so i didn’t feel so alone and she just let me cry and never said anything.

my mom is kind of in the fat acceptance community and is definitely the reason why I developed BED which probably led me to restricting once i realized how ugly i was my mom is easily 300lbs and shes my height 

I have fat friends and I love them and care about them and think that they’re beautiful to be clear i don’t consider myself fatphobic towards anyone other than myself and my mom. 

I don’t do it to her face but i joke w/ my sister about it bc she hates my mom too. My friends also hate her bc of how often i vent to them and i’m moving out soon so hopefully after college I can never talk to her again.

She is also horrible w/boundaries and reads through my sisters phone and probably mine too. if you’re reading this mom fuck you for invading my privacy but i don’t even care anymore im moving out in two weeks have fun being built like the michelin man

104,1e5e580,AITA for refusing pancakes my friends girlfriend made?,"I (24f) am back in my hometown on a weeklong trip for my father’s 50th birthday. It’s a big milestone birthday for him and I haven’t had much time for my family (or friends growing up) since moving to the East Coast. 

Last night I met up with a few of my friends from high school who are still hanging around the area. We hit up a few bars together. Generally, it was an okay time. Not really my type of place anymore but it was so nice to see my best friend (25m) who I grew up with. He’s still as amazing as he was the day we were separated. We all got a little drunk on shitty beers and he offered to let me come home with him and crash instead of going home to my folks drunk at midnight. I want it to be known that I appreciate this. The last thing I needed was my mom getting up to nag me about going out on a Tuesday. 

We got back to his place and his girlfriend was still up. She was cold and standoffish when we got in which made me super uncomfortable. I just wanted to go to bed but we all also had a minor disagreement on where I’d be sleeping. Eventually, I compromised on that and my bestie talked her into making us something to eat. Here’s the big problem. I was raised to be gracious even if your host is not. I try hard to follow those rules. 

She ended up agreeing to make us pancakes. I wasn’t wild about this idea considering I limit my sugar intake to almost zero, but I kept my mouth shut at the time. I would have continued to keep my mouth shut, but watching her make them was too much. She put white sugar in the batter, then added blueberries for additional sugar, and then buttered the pan because fuck it, we apparently don’t care about that shit here. She continued to butter the pan again every few pancakes. I suggested that maybe a nonstick fat-free cooking spray would be better but she pretended not to hear me. 

The real killer was the syrup. Maple flavored corn syrup. So yummy. I didn’t want to eat dry pancakes even though they were probably already overwhelmingly sweet and politely asked her if maybe they had some ingredients for me to make a smoothie instead. At this point, she got INCREDIBLY pissy and told me to eat them or not and then threw the pan into the sink. It was so childish that I couldn’t believe it. Go off girl, go ahead and throw a tantrum because I’d like an alternative to your gross food.

I ended up having to take an uber home in the middle of the night because they started to fight. Now I’m sitting here sobering up and wondering if maybe I should have just politely nibbled on the corner of one and gone to bed. Fuck me for wanting a smoothie right?

106,1e5dzyz,AITA for 'starting drama?',"So this happened late last year around November December. I (15NB) and my friends C (16m) Q(15GF) and P (14F) got into a feud. 
C and I got into an argument over him insulting my body. Anyone who knows me, would know that my love language is insulting people. I insult my friends and I never mean to hurt them. I am also autistic and sometimes I don't know if I hurt someone with my jokes, so if they show obvious signs, I will ask if they're okay and if they want me to tone it down. C and I were going back and forth on pretend insulting eachother and he said someone along the lines of ""you're flat."" I am very insecure about my body and I told him that he actually hurt me and he said that he didn't care and that ended up in a fight. Out of spite, I ended up reporting all his socials, TikTok, Insta , you name it. And when he found out he messaged me and just fucking went off at me. Stuff like ""Fuck you, you flat bitch."" ""Kys."" And told me he wishes my parents would leave me to die. Q went off at both of us and said we were both in the wrong and I admit that reporting his socials is a bit bad but what he said was far worse. Q would also go on about me getting into fights would affect them. Shit like ""It upsets me and I can't handle with you starting drama all the time."" When it's usually people constantly shit talking me and I end up snapping back. Over time, we stopped texting and I found out from a friend that Q didn't like me anymore and started getting tired of me. I was absolutely crushed and started crying. And in my anger I sent them message, ending our friendship. While this was happening, I would vent about this to my best friend P.
P and I were best friends since we were babies. P and I got into an argument because P couldn't handle hearing my problems and said she wanted a break for a while, I understood and gave her a week before texting her how long this would last. We had never gone longer than a couple of days without talking and she left me on opened. A week later, she blocked me. 
While I was still friends with Q, I would try to tell them to stop being friends with C because he was toxic and also transphobic, which was something that Q hated in a person. Q completely ignored me and called me an attention seeker when I was genuinely worried about Q and didn't want them to get hurt. The same thing happened early last year, Q befriended my childhood bully and refused to listen when I tried to warn them about her. The girl later ended up being toxic a year after they started being friends. Q also had a crush on C, so that's the biggest reason why they didn't listen when I tried warning them about him. A month after I stopped being friends with Q, C ended up talking shit about Q's dead grandmother behind their back and stopped their situationship they had at the time. 

More with P. When I started hurting myself because of all the stress about what was happening and when P found out, she threatened to tell my mother to make me stop. When I would vent to her, she'd get mad at me, yet when I didn't tell her about stuff going on, she would go on about how I didn't trust her and should've told her.
Months after all this happened, a girl I was friends with who was also still friend with Q had an argument with Q. Where Q went on about how I hurt both them and P and made P hurt herself when both of them made me hurt myself. Went on about how much I hurt them even though they didn't give a single example of what I did wrong to them.

107,1e5djay,AITA for choosing my brothers to do some of the father of the bride traditions at my wedding and not my stepdad?,"My dad died when my brothers and I (26f) were 12m, 7f and 5m. I was 12 when I met my stepdad for the first time. He and mom got married just before my 13th birthday. So it was a short time I knew him before he became my stepdad. My stepdad met us all expecting he would be stepping in as a dad to all three of us. For this reason he and my older brother never got along.

My younger brother and I were younger so it was expected we'd be different but it didn't work that way. I liked him and saw him more like an uncle, not a dad or a parent, and he tried really hard to be more than that, sometimes far too hard and it caused us to pull back. It would then lead to discussions and asking why we were resisting having a second dad, and being told we could have more than one, our dad would want us to have more than one. It led us to therapy where my mom and stepdad were told by the therapist that it wasn't something they could or should force and that being an uncle figure was better than all three of us landing where my older brother did, which they were risking. We also got to hear in therapy how my stepdad never got to have kids of his own and would have loved them and so he felt extra hurt that the kids he loved and wanted to be that dad for, didn't want him in that way.

There was a definite shift after therapy. He was less involved, still caring and all but he did pull away some, and while I think we were supposed to want him more, it was a relief. Both my younger brother and I were more relaxed about our stepdad after that. We didn't miss his extra efforts and my mom told us a few times that it made my stepdad feel really shitty.

I got engaged recently and my mom and stepdad asked me directly if my stepdad would be given the role as father of the bride. I told them I was intending to ask my older brothers. But not in the full role more so a few of the traditions that come with it. My stepdad asked me not to. He said he wanted to fill the role. That he wanted to walk me down the aisle and have a father daughter dance, as well as being the one who says he gives me to my fiancé. I told him I understood but that wasn't what I wanted. I told him he would still be included just not that way, that he and mom would be seated at a table with my ILs, would be walking to their seats together like my ILs, would be announced like them. After that talk I asked my brothers and both of them said yes. My younger brother said they'd wear something of dad's while doing it and since they both look SO much like him, we all do, it could be an extra comfort to me. I was so happy.

My mom and stepdad aren't happy. They told me the discussion was not over and I didn't give my stepdad enough consideration. My mom told me I could have given my stepdad the greatest gift, of being a dad for one day, and I denied him. And by choosing both brothers, especially my younger brother, I insulted him.

For clarity's sake, my stepdad is not giving any money to the wedding.

109,1e5d4pf,WIBTA for asking my friend to tone down the PDA with her wife when we hang out because PDA in general makes me uncomfortable?,"Before I begin please note that I fully support my friend and her wife’s relationship and that PDA in general makes me uncomfortable regardless of the sexuality of the couple. Also I know PDA technically means “public displays of affection” but I am using “public” to mean “in front of me”.

 My(26F)  longtime friend (25F) recently got married to her now wife (24F). I am genuinely very happy for them and have been supportive of their relationship from the beginning. My friend is happier than I have ever seen her and I consider her wife a close friend too. Recently while the 3 of us are hanging out they have begun showing more PDA and it makes me uncomfortable, especially when we are in my home.

It’s nothing sexual or sloppy, but they do frequently (and repeatedly) kiss one another on the mouth, cheek, forehead, shoulders, and arms, or will put their arms around each other to hug/hold one another while we’re just standing around talking. Or I’ll look over and they’re holding a 10 second or more hug. It seems constant and kind of makes me feel like I’m intruding on their space even when I’m in my own house. For context I have no problem seeing them snuggling when we watch movies, holding hands, or kissing every so often. I’m fine with them being more physical in the guest room if I happen to walk by and the door is open because it is THEIR space for as long as they are staying there. I don’t want them to feel like they have to hide, I just want them to keep intimate things more private. 

They are generally very conscientious about PDA when we are hanging out in public or at other friends houses, and I only notice them doing it when it is just the 3 of us. I’m glad that they feel comfortable in my home and I hate that their PDA makes me feel so uncomfortable. We are all from a religious background and they have had many friends/family members treat them poorly or go no contact because they are gay and I don’t want them to think I don’t support their relationship or am treating them differently because of their sexuality. 

Some background on me if you’ve read this far: I am completely straight and not jealous of their relationship at all. I have never had this issue before because I have never had another couple in my circle of friends (straight or otherwise) show this much PDA around me. I am very open with them about my relationship struggles as a single person, so I think showing this much PDA in front of me when they know I am single and desire to be in a long term relationship is a bit inconsiderate on their part.

So WIBTA for asking them to tone down the PDA in front of me and risk them thinking I am uncomfortable with their relationship? Or am I being overly sensitive and should just continue to ignore their PDA even though it makes me uncomfortable? Is this type of PDA around friends common?

He and my mother got divorced when she found out and he went on to marry his AP “Anna” and they have another daughter (9). 

Normally, I only ever see my dad without Anna or the kids. However, this summer I got an internship in a city that’s about 90 minutes (traffic) away from home but only 30 mins from my dad’s, so I’ve been staying at his place Mon-Thurs. 

On the weekend, a friend from school was having a party at their place in the city. I knew my dad, Anna, and kids would be gone until late because every other Saturday they all go and see Anna’s parents, so I asked my dad if I could have some people over before we go to the party and he said ok. It was only supposed to be three people, but then four more people got added. Two of these people are my cousins from my dad’s side of the family (they weren’t supposed to be around but they came home early from a trip). 

My dad has been LC with his family since the affair, because they won’t let him bring Anna and the kids around. I still see them though and I go to school with my cousins. I thought it wouldn’t be a big deal to have them over because everyone was out and weren’t going to be back. 

We were all hanging out in the den when Anna and my dad and the kids appeared in the doorway. Anna took the kids upstairs without saying anything and then came down to argue with my dad. My dad ended up telling me that the cousins had to leave, so we all just left and went out before the party.

When I saw my dad the next day, he told me it was wrong of me to invite everyone over and that Anna was really upset. I said I thought they wouldn’t be there and that we’d be gone before they got home but he insisted I shouldn’t have had them in the house just in case. This seemed so dramatic. It’s not any of us kids fault that our parents have issues. I didn’t do it on purpose but it’s such a low grade drama, unless you’re Anna who I guess doesn’t want to be reminded of why she doesn’t know my cousins. I also thought it was incredibly rude to kick them out. It’s not even their fault their parents want nothing to do with Anna. I got annoyed and said “why am I being made responsible for navigating the consequences of your and Anna’s actions?”. My dad said because I was in his house it makes it my problem while I’m there. I don’t agree. 

My dad is still pouting about the whole situation. Every time we’re talking he just sighs and brings up how hurt he is that I was disloyal to him in his house or something. I’m getting so tired of it but my mother’s boyfriend actually agrees with my dad and he’s a pretty reasonable guy so I’m giving it a second thought. I don’t actually want to hurt my dad, and I’m assuming he’s not hurt just sulking but if I am actually a bit of a dick then I’ll apologise.

111,1e5cqg2,AITA for telling my grandma and uncle remove the dogs in the house? ,"Hello! I(15f) and my siblings (14m, 6m, 6f) are at my grandmas house for summer vacation. Her house is far larger than ours, and she owns two smaller dogs that roam around. And before I get into anything, I don’t like house dogs, especially ones that aren’t taken care of, but I would never neglect/ be rude to them obviously. One of the dogs is an actual house dog, and is groomed/cleaned..not very regularly, but it’s enough to keep them in the house. The second dog is a dog that was kept outside with the rest of them, and is bathed every 1-2 months or so, and is being kept in the house because she is in heat (her heat ended weeks ago. My uncle is just attached to the dog and won’t let her back outside.) Im not sure how frequently you should bathe dogs, so I’m sorry in advance. To be blunt, both dogs have ticks, and fleas. The ticks have been found around the house, in bedsheets, in the sofa, and on my and my little siblings skin because both my grandma and my uncle don’t frequently wash them. I’ve had to throw so many clothes/beddings in the dryer because there’s been ticks in them. Ive mentioned to her that it’s not safe, and she should let them outside, and she just says “sure” and never does it. I finally took it upon myself to wash both of the dogs, and not even a day later my grandma lets both of the dogs outside to roll around in the tick infested grasses or whatever, and they both come back disgusting. I told her that I was going to have to wash them again and she was like “yeah they should be washed every week” which is hypocritical because she doesn’t do that herself. I told both her and my uncle to remove the dogs because it’s severely unhygienic. The dogs urinate/defecate on the floor because they are not taught well/aren’t let out on time, and I’m stuck mopping the floors because no one cleans it up. My uncle got mad at me and told me that it wasn’t my place, and that I don’t live here, but it’s literally not safe to have ticks roaming around the house. I eventually got really upset and told both of them to take the dogs to the pound, or whatever it’s called because they’re jumping in beds, scratching at you when your eating because they want food, and they’re subjecting me and my siblings to possible diseases by the ticks, and it’s driving me crazy because it’s just not clean to me.

112,1e5cpxl,WIBTA if I filed a complaint against the EMS for their response time?,"So, on Sunday my son (10 m) suffered a level three trauma, that’s what the hospital classified it as. My boys, my daughter(8 f), my husband (35 m), and I (34 f) were all at the kids’ dad’s (41 m) house, we just got done celebrating my oldest (12 m) birthday at top golf, just the 6 of us. Well we went back to his house and the boys went out back to play, we didn’t think anything of it. My daughter was inside with us and planned on coming outside to play too, but was helping me grab drinks for everyone. So for starters, I did not know that my ex even had a golf club or balls…he’s not even a golfer. Well, turns out my oldest was hitting golf balls. My 10 year old was far too close and took a 7 iron gold club to the face after my oldest hit a ball. I heard an awful scream, run outside and the boys were running to the house, my 10 year old was pouring blood from his mouth and nose. He was was hit right near the inside of his eye. I immediately call 911, my husband grabs a towel and sit our son down and was able to calm him, get his heart rate down to try and control the bleeding. This is were my issue with the EMS comes into play. It took 14 minutes for the ambulance to respond. No other first responders showed, there’s a fire station one street over. This is not a secluded country area. No police showed up, I called 911 back asking where they were and begged them to hurry, it was the longest 14 mins of my life. I was told they will get there and that I needed to calm down and they’re coming, then she hung up. My son was very lethargic, thankfully we could keep him up, I do not want to imagine what would have happened if he had passed out, the blood pooled in his throat and he aspirated on his blood. So I need to know if a 14 min response time is enough to warrant a formal complaint? I feel like someone else could have come before the ambulance that has training to help until they got there. I also think the dispatcher should have stayed on the phone with us in the event he did pass out or anything else started happening. I feel like so much went wrong here, but I also do not know what the average response time is or how any of it works. So, I’m almost second guessing myself and thinking I may be overreacting at what could be the normal cause I was a terrified mom with a severely injured child.

It could have been me, I have a track record of accidently clicking the end call button.  He sent a ""did u hang up"" then a minute later responded ""imma go to bed i'm tired"".

The next day I sent an Instagram reel which he reacted too. However I sent an apology text for the way I was acting and how I should have calmed down and listen to him speak.

115,1e5bv0r,AITA for telling a good friend we are no longer friends?,"

That happened yesterday. I was supposed to meet with my friend ""not long term friendship but a brother/sister friendship. We really rely on each others"" In general, he does a lot of little annoying things, like taking forever to text me back or holding his phone when we are together.
But other than that we don't really have problems, yesterday I was out with my younger sisters, and we decided to meet up as I have a serious problem with my parents and I really need it to talk to him.
The thing is, he broke up last week, and he's the kind to avoid people when struggling, especially me as he can't stop himself from telling me what is going on while this is not his usual self.
I wasn't gonna ask about it as I really have a huge fight with my parents and really need it him (he stills not ready to talk about it and I can tell as I met him once and he just wanted to go home so I didn't ask about it and let it until he's ready). On the way to our meet point, he met this coworker. ""She's a girl, but I don't think he's interested in her as he didn't move on yet."" she asked him for a coffee, and he preferred to take her out and cancelled with me tho he was 2 min away from where I was! 
That made me so annoyed, and I get made at him.
When he reached home and talked to me I told him he's no longer a close friend although I consider him as a younger brother during our friendship but it feels like he doesn't think about me that way.
And told him that I'm not gonna ask to meet up with him ever again.
Which was quite extra as I know how much he hates when people abandon him, and I know that he is still going through hard times after the breakup.
This morning, I felt so bad and sent him a message and asked if he wanna meet me.
But I donna look like I'm clinging, so I'm considering deleting the message and not talking to him if he didn't talk to me first.

He has a bad hip from a nasty fall that makes it difficult some days for him to stand but he wont go to a doctor like I've been encouraging him to do as he's afraid of being put on disability. Stating this for context. Some days are better than others for him, but I do think he should still go to a doctor and get it looked at because the fall could have caused a break that healed improperly.

We were excruciatingly slow tonight and our manager decided to send one of us home, I don't know how they decided it but they ended up choosing me. If I had to guess it was most likely because I'm the closest to going into overtime. My brother was rather upset about this and kept trying to get me to swap with him because he wanted to go home instead and didnt want to close, I stated that because of him constantly missing days and me having to stay late or come in on my day off; I've been having to put off date plans with my wife and she has been getting very angry with me over this and this would give me a chance to take her on a surprise date to try and smooth things over.

He was still angry and generally acting childish, wouldn't talk to me and kept giving snappy answers when he had to respond to me. Some of his friends, and some of mine, were calling me an insensitive asshole and that he could have been hurting and wanted to go home to rest. Not once did he say he was hurting, and even seemed to be moving better than he had in a while which we both were happy with before heading into work so I don't think thats the issue, and now that he is home he seems to be fine now and doesn't seem as angry anymore but now I cant help but feel like maybe I was an asshole.

119,1e5be10,AITA for ignoring my best friend after he ignored first,"So im a 18y/o woman who entered college here in Mexico months ago. I first met this guy (Also 18, I'll call him Frank) and after some talk we became really good friends. He might be a jerk sometimes but we really have a lot in common. So later on we decided to join this other girl (Who i will refer as MJ) and her social circle. I met this other guy who was best friends with MJ, we became really close and I started liking him.

So every day after college, me and Frank take the bus home as we live really nearby each other, but we both started to go to MJs house before taking the bus just to hang out a couple of minutes as she lives close to college.
After some weeks, Frank was not able to go to MJs house anymore so we stopped going for some time until i decided to go to MJs house alone, leaving Frank alone to his ride home. The reason of me going to MJs was because I wanted advice about the guy I mentioned (Who was also not able to go to MJs from the start) as I said, him and MJ were best friends. I only went to MJs for 3 or 4 days, until she told me she was gonna be busy for the next couple of hours so she couldn't hang out that day. So i went with Frank. While we waited for the bus, he completely ignored me. I was talking to him but he didn't answer to any of my questions, the only thing he did was nod when I asked if he was mad after I let him alone for some days, but after that he just stopped responding so I just stopped talking to him on our ride home. It was friday so I would not see him until monday. When I arrived home I tried to text him trying to apologise but he just let me on seen. When monday arrived  he tried to talk to me as if nothing ever happened but i started to ignore him to him to get a taste of his own childish behavior. He got mad at me, and decided to spill the beans and tell the guy I liked, that I liked him, and started to bad-mouth me to him. I got mad at Frank, and told him that he was a bad listener, and thats why I went to MJs house alone. I blocked him after telling him that I really appreciated our friendship, but if he was to backstab me like that, just because he went to his house alone for less than a week, I would love to just end it there.

I posted a job to tidy up my room/office (mostly putting away (clean) clothes and sorting out piles of paper (not actual filing)).

Apparently, the students thought $AUD 25 a hour for this job was ""insulting"" and now my friend is upset that I ""made her lose face"" and is claiming that I was racist and aiming to exploit Chinese students. 

\*\*AFAIK, $25/hr is standard for most unqualified office jobs, pretty decent for a first year particularly today, when there is a shortage of jobs, and evven a little can go a long way.

122,1e5b12t,AITA for ignoring the girl I rescued from a DV situation?,"I (23 F) live with my fiance (24 M) and our three-month-old son. Recently, I've just gotten involved in a situation that may have put my family in danger of being harassed. I reconnected with an old friend I'll call Nero about a month ago. Nero and I knew each other from when we were little and in high school when we reconnected through mutual friends. Due to some personal problems, we drifted apart and only reconnected in our adulthood. Recently, he had been dating this girl whom I'll call Jasmine. Jasmine at first was quiet and often kept to herself during our meetups. Over time, she opened up more to me and my fiance and soon all four of us became good friends. About a month ago, I got a call from Nero during a family get-together. I had been telling him about some struggles I've had with my mental state so I assumed he was calling me about that. When I answered, I was not expecting him to suddenly tell me that Jasmine had just been kicked out by her mother for fighting and was refusing to let Jasmine in. 

I immediately got Jasmine on a call with me and Nero and asked her to explain what had happened. She told me that she was relaxing in her bedroom when her mother had come in screaming a bunch of obscenities and racial slurs (their family is Indigenous). It didn't take long for Jasmine to realise her mother had taken some drugs and was high off her mind. When Jasmine tried to talk to her mother, the fighting grew worse to the point where Jasmine had gotten kicked out into the cold with nothing but her phone. Hearing this, I immediately got my fiance and we both drove down to pick up Jasmine. We brought her back to our home and told her she could stay the night and figure out her plan in the morning. She thanked us profusely and slept on our couch for the night. The next day, my fiance and I helped her get a hotel and assisted her with getting back down to her family in another state. After some troubles, we eventually got her back down to her family and they all thanked us for our help.   
  
Nero and Jasmine had talked beforehand and with some input from us, decided that because of the distance, it was best to take a break from their relationship and explore other people. That was the last time I had heard from Jasmine until three days ago. 

That afternoon, I was laying around with my newborn and trying to enjoy a quiet afternoon. That morning had already been stressful for me and enjoying some cuddles with my son was helping me to recover. Imagine my surprise when I heard my phone ringing and the caller ID popped up as Jasmine. Confusion set in as I was unsure why she would be calling me from another state. Answering it in the most polite tone I could muster up, imagine my shock when I not only heard Jasmine screaming down the phone but also her mother. The very woman I had tried to 'rescue' her from just a month ago. Not getting much of a chance to talk, Jasmine and her mother began yelling down the phone about how Nero had recently changed his Facebook status from single to 'in a relationship'. I had already been speaking to Nero at this point and knew he had been meeting a girl who I would call Artic but I was unaware they had made it official.  I called Nero to confirm this and through detailed accounts, I figured out that Nero and Jasmine had argued several days before Nero had met Artic and had officially ended any potential for their relationship to continue. I relayed this back to Jasmine who deflected and denied ever having done such a thing. Wanting to play the good guy, I told Jasmine to simply block Nero and forget about him. Although she told me she would, it seemed my answer was not enough for her as she then began calling me every five minutes with a new accusation about Nero and Artic, ranging from how they had threatened Jasmine, as well as Artic, calling and abusing Jasmine over the phone. Nero and Artic both said this was false and provided screenshots of their messages as well as call logs to prove that Jasmine's allegations were false. 

At this point, I was already stressed out of my mind and just wanted it to end but the more I tried to end the conflict the more Jasmine seemed to get upset I wasn't on her side. In the end, I was on a call with Nero when I broke down crying telling him how I couldn't play middleman anymore and I hung up the phone. I spent the rest of that afternoon crying and struggling to cope with my already declined mental health. 

Since then, Jasmine has messaged me asking if I told Nero that she was 'bullying' me and how she could have 'broken me'. So far, I have not responded to her since I honestly don't know where to go. So far, she's been posting on Snapchat and TikTok about how she has become 'single' and how everyone is betraying her. This honestly feels like such a slap to the face and I don't know what else to do. She's still waiting for an answer from me and I don't know how to respond without getting backlash. My other concern is Jasmine knows where I live and given how bad her mother can be when on drugs, I'm worried if I say the wrong thing they will come here and attack me or my family.

She reacted well to the first dose and they're still waiting for approval and my uncle can't find anyone to pay for the medicine in non-local currency since you can't make wire transfers out of my home country without specific authorizations and they don't include this sort of scenario. So they're asking me to pay for this month's dose and they'll pay me back eventually in local currency.

I actually have pretty much no use for that local currency as a I live abroad and it would be illegal for me to even hold it in a bank account because you're not allowed to indirectly exchange local money like that so I'll get in trouble.

We are not sharers even with each other, generally to a fault. This one has got me muddled though. So my dad (72m) decided to sell out completely.

Edit- Some extra information

I left out quite a bit to the lower section so let me add some details. 
The news about the death was public at the time. There were already memorials planned and there were news spreading around about releasing balloons in her name already. Tina is a very well know and popular person in my town. Everyone knew of her but I wasn’t very close to her personally. The person that reached out to me was James (the bfs) Bestfriend. They did not know Tina personally and is as close to her as I am. Troy has asked me to leave the post up so I’ll most likely be leaving it up. I have already deeply apologized to Troy (the bestfriend) about the situation but I’m holding off apologizing To anyone else at the time. I’m not sure if I should leave a link to the post here but I really don’t want to overstep so I won’t be doing it. Thank you so much for everyone that commented and I’m reading every single one of them to try to find out what to do next.

—————————

I’m sorry if this isn’t too interesting I’m just completely freaking out.

Today someone I know’s (James) girlfriend (Tina) died 
. This was a horrible experience and I watched someone I would call my friend break down right in front of me. I ofc knew Tina but I wasn’t too close to her. I felt horrible and I saw one of Tina’s close friends make a post wishing her friends and family a happy life and saying that this was tragedy. I reposted the photo sending condolences everyone who knew Tina.

Around an hour after I made that post one James’ bestfriend (Troy) text messaged me telling me I was fake and super disrespectful for posting about the recent death. Saying that it’s not my place to wish anyone well and because I wasn’t all too close to anyone in the situation (the family or Tina) I should have just kept my mouth close. James friend claimed that I was being fake for only caring now that the woman was dead and I should be mindful on how other people feel.

I personally don’t believe I’ve done anything wrong. I’ve asked around and people are giving me mixed answers. So Reddit, AMITA?

In cause anyone was wondering the post said

133,1e596xl,AITA for not wanting to not wanting my mom's help?,"Hi. I'm (18AFAB) having some struggles with my mother (43F) lately. I feel awful for how I feel about this, but it's so frustrating I need an opinion(s) on this before my next therapy appointment. I'll give some context on me and my mother's relationship, and then get into the meat and bones of what's going on.

I was a miracle baby, and inherited the family name trait (all names have AN in them, including my mother). My mother has PCOS and a whole list of other issues, which only after I was born, she found out I was never supposed to even exist, and she's infertile. My mom's side of the family basically glorified my existence as a miracle (which didn't help with the religious beliefs deeply engrained in my mom's side). 

Looking back on my childhood, since my dad was in the Navy and I was 100% homeschooled K-12, I had a lot of time with my mother. Early on, she tried to press stuff like dance, ballet, dresses, princesses, and the like on me, until I started pulling away from that mid grade school. Stuff like jewelry, nail polish, skirts and the like didn't sit well with me as I grew older, and I truly don't think she liked that. Since I was homeschooled, I had major educational standards held to me as well. My dad had a 160+ IQ score (which I understand isn't a good measure of educational skills, but he's damn smart), and my mother had all As through her own homeschool and college experience. Hell, she has a master's degree (granted, in piano, but that was huge to little me). Along with this, she was a major clean freak, and I was not, which led to a lot of friction. 

As a sidenote, in late grade school she was emotionally unstable, and often did things that I can't describe here. She usually only apologized because my dad made her. He was a saint, but the Navy kept him super busy. While she's been diagnosed with OCD, me and my dad are pretty sure she has Bipolar Disorder. My dad's also expressed that my mother doesn't understand why I'm not more like her, and that he tried his best while I was growing up to alleviate those expectations on me as much as he could. I honestly think he saved me a lot of mental issues.

As I've gotten older, and as my dad eventually had to move to the next state over after getting out of the military (long story, they aren't divorced and we visit on weekends), she's cooled down. She's gotten happier, she hasn't screamed (as much), and only had one mental breakdown in the past 10 years! (Can you hear the sarcasm? Regardless, she's been leagues better). However, as she's gotten more levelled out, I've been losing it. I realized in the past two years that I'm probably trans (FTM), and only my dad knows. That explains the disinterest in most things stereotypically 'feminine'. While she tries to push me towards dresses, blouses, skirts, etc. when we go clothes shopping, I always end up going with flannels, graphic tees, loose shorts/capris, and the like. However, this slightly shifted about 6-7 months ago.

I'm getting ready to go to art college locally in the fall, and figured I needed an extra hands-on hobby so I had a creative outlet to destress with. I ended up choosing bead weaving/Kandi and jewelry making! I specifically liked making charms and cuffs, since to me it was basically pixel art. I ended up enjoying this so much, I decided to sign up as a vendor at a small local craft fair this October! I have this whole plan where it's going to look akin to a DnD/Fantasy adventurer's shop, with a canopy and everything. I'm super jazzed, and really wanted to sell fandom-inspired merch. Since I've been trying to make an effort as of late to include my parents in what's going on in my life, I decided to tell my mom about it.

She quickly had a bunch of ideas for basic bracelets. Like, a single string of beads kind of bracelets. Which I'm not against, but whenever I talked about making the cuffs or even selling some Kandi projects (which I showed her pictures of the patterns and such), she always deflected or talked about how ""the singles will sell better and are cheaper, let's focus on those."". I figured I could always bring an extra table for my nerdy stuff, and the other venue-provided table could be for the stuff she recommended (affectionately called ""the Normie table"" by only me). However, as this planning phase has gone on, it feels like she's been pulling me further and further from what I want to sell. She literally sent me a list of themes and words to put on bracelets to sell, and looked at my booth design sketch and said ""that's not going to happen"".

What's worse is that she's been buying me tons of beads for this. She's bought me at least $75 worth of beads from Hobby Lobby already, from Czech beads to Miyuki Delicas (granted all of the bead's she's bought me were on sale, but still!). On top of all that, today for Prime day she got me another $50 worth of stuff for the singles, saying I can ""pay her back later"" once I get the job I'm shooting for to help pay for some of the projects I wanna make. When I tried to ask her if we could cut out one of the more expensive items in exchange for like, perler beads or pony beads, she just said ""No, we can always buy those later. We're focusing on the singles right now."". I'm losing my mind! I feel like she's either trying to use this to ""feminize"" me for lack of a better word, or to live vicariously through me. I can't tell which is worse, especially since I'm not out to her. Thank god she doesn't use Reddit.

I just finished with another set of bracelets she wanted me to make before writing this, and I honestly don't want to do this anymore. I signed up for this fair so I could make a booth that *I* would want to visit. I named the damn thing ""Mythos Emporium"", but now I feel like I should rename it to ""Pretty Preppy"" and just let my mother take over the damn thing. I feel awful, considering how excited she is for this, but I feel stifled, frustrated, and most importantly, unimportant. She keeps telling me to be creative with the bracelets, but what she's looking for isn't my forte, so it's been hella hard. I've had to copy designs from Pinterest, and I feel awful doing so. I can do color palettes and watermelon bracelets, but I want to make art with these beads, not something an 8th grader would make with directions from mommy.

I figured I could always bring an extra table for my nerdy stuff, and the other venue-provided table could be for the stuff she recommended (affectionately called ""the Normie table"" by only me). However, as this planning phase has gone on, it feels like she's been pulling me further and further from what I want to sell. She literally sent me a list of themes and words to put on bracelets to sell, and looked at my booth design sketch and said ""that's not going to happen"".

What's worse is that she's been buying me tons of beads for this. She's bought me at least $75 worth of beads from Hobby Lobby already, from Czech beads to Miyuki Delicas (granted all of the bead's she's bought me were on sale, but still!). On top of all that, today for Prime day she got me another $50 worth of stuff for the singles, saying I can ""pay her back later"" once I get the job I'm shooting for to help pay for some of the projects I wanna make. When I tried to ask her if we could cut out one of the more expensive items in exchange for like, perler beads or pony beads, she just said ""No, we can always buy those later. We're focusing on the singles right now."". I'm losing my mind! I feel like she's either trying to use this to ""feminize"" me for lack of a better word, or to live vicariously through me. I can't tell which is worse, especially since I'm not out to her. Thank god she doesn't use Reddit.

I just finished with another set of bracelets she wanted me to make before writing this, and I honestly don't want to do this anymore. I signed up for this fair so I could make a booth that *I* would want to visit. I named the damn thing ""Mythos Emporium"", but now I feel like I should rename it to ""Pretty Preppy"" and just let my mother take over the damn thing. I feel awful, considering how excited she is for this, but I feel stifled, frustrated, and most importantly, unimportant. She keeps telling me to be creative with the bracelets, but what she's looking for isn't my forte, so it's been hella hard. I've had to copy designs from Pinterest, and I feel awful doing so. I can do color palettes and watermelon bracelets, but I want to make art with these beads, not something an 8th grader would make with directions from mommy.

134,1e58llm,AITA for choosing a new friend over an old one?,"I (16f) have been friends with a girl, let’s call her Melanie for 5 years. We started high school 2 years ago and I thought things would stay good between us until I met someone else around 8 months ago, let’s call her Bethany. Bethany and I are basically the same person. We have the same taste in music, movies, shows, sports, etc. so we hit it off instantly.

For further context, Melanie and Bethany knew each other way before I knew either of them but they cut contact with each other for 2 years prior to these events I’m about to share.

I start to hang out with Bethany and whole lot more than I do with Melanie and I begin to notice her behaviour changing. She becomes more distant with me and becoming drier with texts.

One day I’m having lunch with Bethany and Melanie asks if she can join us. We both are okay with it since we both know her. Little did I know that would be a big mistake. Melanie tries to hog all of Bethany’s attention from me and all of Bethany’s other friends and only talks to her and barely me, and from that point on, I would start to be more pissed.

For the next 5 months she would willingly invite herself to lunch and conversations that had nothing to do with her. When me and Bethany would talk about something like baseball, which Melanie doesn’t like, she would divert the attention back to herself by talking about herself to Bethany. And before Melanie came along, me and Bethany would walk down the halls before our next period and just gossip to each other. But lo and behold, Melanie came along and intruded on our conversations to make them about herself.

 the situation at hand worsened in April, when in a shared class I have with the other 2 friends, we had to do an assignment and Bethany requested we work in a group of 3. Melanie was behind on the work from earlier but she said yes anyways. I decided to work ahead since she was still behind. Both of them got mad at me and then Melanie had the nerve to say “This is why we didn’t want to include you” straight to my face. Bethany objected and said that she wanted to include me which I still believe, since I was there the whole time and Bethany wasn’t showing any signs of exclusion towards me.

You’d think it’d be simple to just tell her that we don’t want her there but no. Melanie has a history of storming off if she was pointed out or was in the wrong, which makes it incredibly difficult to confront her.

Are we the assholes? To clarify, she is not over her ex that broken over a month ago. She gets really upset every time he’s talking to someone new & she does the same thing. So please are we really in the wrong?

For more information she has stopped talking to all of her friends including us & has only came back to vent about her issues. She “never” had the time to spend time with us not unless her boyfriend at the time was there. Everywhere she went, he would also be there as well. 

After their breakup they’ll both constantly ask my friend about each other. Always asking if they’re seeing anyone new.  Their relationship was never a healthy relationship. Constantly blaming & hurting each other. She has talked to her ex multiple times after she told him she “cut him off” which she never did. And him logging into her account & finding all those messages.That caused more issues in their relationship.

145,1e56tp0,AITA for finally giving up on my mother even if she could die?,"I (31F) lived with my mother almost my entire life. She originally used to say that she never wanted me to become her caretaker because I'd had been that for my grandmother, but over time things changed. When my stepfather died, she began to change. Her emotional abuse got much much worse, she would get extremely aggressive and at every opportunity would tear me down as a person. It got to the point that she even gave my grandmother a heart attack during an argument.

In the last few years she's gotten even worse. She was beating the shit out of me for not agreeing or correcting her, or she would at every second tear me down for being emotionally damaged and having trouble functioning because of it. It was a vicious cycle of pain. At one point she even threatened to release private conversations between my partner and myself to make us look bad in addition to her saying she'd happily beat me again. Not to mention the specific childhood trauma  I endured, claiming I was making up or miss remembering and that she was the biggest victim of that situation.

I know she has mental health issues, she is bipolar and had a mini stroke a few years ago. But instead of treating anything she just wastes her life away to be bitter and drive everyone away. My cousin and I were the last people in her life, but when she said she would happily beat me again, my partner had enough and moved me in with them less than a month later and my cousin is cutting off contact with her.

Fast forward to this week, she is in the hospital. She has multiple things wrong and it could potentially be life threatening, but we don't know yet. The doctors began to talk about putting her in assisted living because she can barely take care of herself, and that's without them even knowing she makes poor financial decisions and her house is a hoarding situation. The place has major structural damage and mold, it can barely be called livable. She has guilted me for money, stolen at least $1000 from me, and cornered me into paying her roughly $3000 property taxes multiple times.

Now, my cousin is currently with her as he went to help clean her house. He had no idea how bad it was before he got there. While she was in the hospital he did some basic cleaning by gathering rancid trash and vacuuming dead insects. Well, that was the wrong thing to do. She flipped out, and for some reason blamed me specifically for not stopping him as if controlling another adult from 3000 miles across the country is my job. She has now decided I am not to be updated on her condition and will not contact me. I don't expect this to last too long, but after 30 years of this woman's abuse, I'm done. She has done this to herself. The only reason I plan to talk to her is to check on my cat who she was watching until I could go back and get her. I finally don't care if she dies.

Lastly, we had plans and I really wanted to go. They completely flaked on me. One more thing to explain our dynamic invited her somewhere one night and she never said if she was or wasn’t going. Okay so this is where the problem comes in…

Now you understand how we communicate and the dynamic this is what happened. I suggested we take a trip this summer. However I wasn’t clear about when I was going to be available. And my mental health hit me hard. I completely isolated from the world. They contacted me asking if I was okay but I didn’t have the energy to respond. Finally when I felt like myself again I reached out and explained everything. She said she’s glad I’m feeling better but bailing on our plans wasn’t okay.

A few days ago he mentioned that a few nights worked with them and asked what worked with me. Locked in a date and all is well. 

That night after dinner he let me know time and location and this is where the issue started. 

He let me know that the dinner place is a bar/diner (pub for those not US). I’m not really comfortable in these settings and prefer proper restaurants and finer dining, which he knows, he said that his friend and partner wanted to try out this new place. 

An argument stemmed from this as I mentioned I’d prefer more dining-esque options and he said that his friends wanted to go there and what’s wrong with the spot. 

Admittedly this is a little bit of an issue for us. I’m from a very white collar upbringing and he’s worked himself up to a high level but his family and friends are very blue collar and his circles due to that do sometimes expose me to cultural clashes.

So I was surprised when a stranger, Randy, showed up at an intimate birthday party. I was even more surprised to learn that Randy had just moved into the attic and would be babysitting the kids the following week. 

Apparantly Randy had a bad breakup, and my bro decided to give him a place to crash until he gets back on his feet. But now Randy is over every time I've visited this week, joining family meals, trying to joke with me, making a mess in the kitchen, planning activities for the kids. I totally ignore him. 

Bro only met Randy very recently, a couple of months ago, and I've heard his name come up maybe twice. When I asked my bro about it, he told me a partial lie that Randy was his wife's friend (why lie?). When I told Randy that I had plans for the kids yesterday, he told bro that the kids must be disappointed not to be with him. Things got even more weird when I saw cutesy bromance texts between Randy & bro (I wasn't snooping, bro asked me to look up a recipe).

(To be fair my bro's wife seems to be fine with the situation) Doesn't Randy have any other friends? How did they get so close so fast? Is it right to incorporate a stranger into the lives of two little kids, both under age 8?

Naturally I try to find her because curiosity killed the cat. I easily find her through my boyfriend’s following.

(for context I am my boyfriend’s first black girlfriend, a little on the chubbier side. She’s a top tier skinny brunette. He is also my first everything (boyfriend,kiss,ect I have no exes or experience in dating))

It did make me feel a certain way, but I sat on it for a week just in case I was overthinking/overreacting.(He not only followed her main account but also her spam account and her side hustle account)I didn’t tell him I found her, but I did ask if they were close and still talked he said no.

He replied that he wants to create a safe space for me to talk about uncomfortable topics, so to just spill it out. 
I told him that it made me feel weird that he was following three of her accounts, I said that ideally he would follow none, but could he JUST follow her main account?

he replied saying that he spent almost half a decade with her, and he will not be unfollowing her. That they ended on good terms and this is his way of supporting her.
he said that me asking that is a little controlling, that he doesn’t go through my following to tell me who to follow. He said that I was asking for too much. he continued saying that that’s why he hates social media because it just creates problems and he doesn’t want me to force him to things to be with him.

I understand where he’s coming from and I told him that I didn’t want to argue as this was an uncomfortable topic for me, and that im not trying to control him or give an ultimatum. it was a little awkward because it wasn’t the answer I wanted to hear…but i understood..?

She often complains to me about him and I’ve suggested to her that she asks for couples therapy to start communicating better.

I started to get very bothered when he answered questions with a condescending tone, and when he just repeated himself when we ask him to explain what he means. It’s been building up. 
He has been even more difficult lately, mostly when we go out for groceries. He wants to rush through the process and gets mad if his girlfriend and I want to think through some stuff, like lunch options and whatnot. When at the market, we are usually either battling this dynamic or we are all silent because he has given an ultimatum to his gf about a simple meal prep decision and stopped responding.

The last development is this passive agressive  response when there is a misunderstanding with his gf. After a little back and forth he says , sometimes quietly and looking the other  way, “ok, I better shut up then”.

I started to point out when I thought he was being unreasonable, I can take blame for it coming off passive aggressive too but when addressed directly he also stops listening. I’ve done things like say the same things he says when it applies to him and then point out that that is not nice and how he does it often.

Well, we’ve been studying a data science course together, paying half of the subscription each on my account and then we’ll do the same on his account for tree diploma. Today I had the keyboard, this was a boring lab and he had done the first half. We were trying to isolate the error in my code and he kept repeating what he wanted me to do, and I had the same idea but since I was not writing it exactly as in his head he was repeating “dude, I just want to see this part do this differently…”. I said, “you’re so impatient, you’re so childish”.  He has called me “a 6 years old with no self control” when I struggle to avoid fast food or impulsive buying, so I thought this could go here. 

He said to his cat “come George, let’s shut up together, will you?” 
When I was done with the changes he wanted to the code, I said “look, here it is done”. 
His girlfriend said “your mistake, he won’t answer to you now”. 
I then stopped, closed my laptop and got up. She asked if we would not continue studying, I said that two can play that game, that I’d go do my house chores.

They both now seem mad at me, I think I should not tolerate his condescendeng and passive agressive talk, and it was the first time he wanted to “I’ll shut up” to me. If he wouldn’t engage then I wouldn’t either and we can continue studying tomorrow. 
I worry that my reaction was exaggerated. AITA?",Everyone Sucks,2024-07-17,"AITA for overreacting? So I’m a guy. I moved in with friends last year. They’re a couple, the three of us are around 30yo. The other guy, started to show some behavior I didn’t like. Talking condescendingly, not answering questions and stop talking when one could not hear him the first couple times he said something. She often complains to me about him and I’ve suggested to her that she asks for couples therapy to start communicating better.

I started to get very bothered when he answered questions with a condescending tone, and when he just repeated himself when we ask him to explain what he means. It’s been building up.

152,1e55n89,AITA for not greeting some of my family members and just staying in my room,"Some of my family came over today, and usually, I'd greet them for a second, then return to my room even though I honestly never want to, and it's not because I'm shy but because ive been battling with depression for a while and can't bring myself to do anything. My family has never cared much about mental health and always avoided talking about it and even when I had a therapist my mom would hate when I talked about how I was feeling, mostly because it made her look bad as a parent same thing with every other adult in my family. When I do end up talking to them it's always about why do I not like talking to them or it's shit talk about one of my brothers since they aren't doing well for themselves atm which is also another reason i'd rather not greet them. In future I plan on just cutting them all off

153,1e55l1k,AITA for not going to my dad first when he showed up today? ,"I, 16f have never had a great relationship with my father. He left when I was seven and has been an absentee parent at best. Earlier today, his girlfriend baked a chocolate pie because my mother mentioned me craving chocolate. Once he arrived, he had my brother bring the pie in. I have issues with my feet touching dirt, so I went on the front porch to get the pie and put it in the fridge. After I put it in the fridge, I went to put my shoes on so I could go say hi to him. By the time I got my shoes on, my brother, who lives with him had already gotten into the truck and they were already pulling out of the driveway. So, about an hour ago him and his girlfriend came over to collect some clothes from my grandmother for my dad’s girlfriends kids. He came into the house and told me how disrespectful I was and how it was insulting to him that I didn’t even thank him for the pie. He is a diagnosed narcissist and I feel like he guilt tripped me into apologizing. When I did he said “you don’t even deserve to apologize”. He makes me so mad sometimes and all I’ve ever wanted was a father. He knows how I feel about dirt and he didn’t even give me the chance to see him. So, please give me advice because I’m so tired.

154,1e55ife,AITA for not being able to bring my cat inside but doing the best I can for him anyways?,"I (16TM) have a cat named Nibbles. He's been my best friend and bonded pet since my mother (38F) got rid of my previous cat, Amber. When we adopted Nibbles, my mom said she'd be his primary caretaker and was, for a short while, but she quickly got annoyed by constantly taking care of a kitten and passed it onto me. I was alright with this and became his primary caretaker, and I love him with all my heart. Here's the issue tho. Despite him being litter trained and a great indoor cat, my mother put him outside because she didn't like the smell of the litter box. We live in a very cat-friendly neighborhood, so he's not in obvious danger, but it's still really bad for him. We feed and water him daily on the porch and, with my own money, I even bought him a collar.

Most people on tiktok say that I should get him re-homed since I'm ""not taking care of him"" but the thing is, I have. Everyone I've asked, in and out of family, have all said no for various reasons, so he's staying here. And I can't take him to a shelter, because who knows who would adopt him, hell, he might be the next ""blender cat"" if I do that. I plan on taking him with me and giving him the best life possible once I move out, and I'm doing everything in my power to do that for him now, but people still act like I'm in the wrong for having him in the first place.

The thing is, we only have him because he would have died otherwise. When we took him in, it was because he was a runt, he wasn't able to nurse and his mother was abandoning him, so we took him in from across the street and bottle fed him back to health. He's dependent on us now, if you're sitting/laying down, he WILL loaf on your chest, he's extremely affectionate, he's just all round an amazing cat! The last time my mother got rid of a cat, the one named Amber who I mentioned earlier, she did it behind my back and was cruel enough to LIE about it when I asked. I only learned the truth when she let it slip to my great great grandmother (???F) that she ""got rid of the one who kept popping out kittens."" (Context: She refused to get her spayed despite how often I begged and opted to just ditch her somewhere.) When I found out, I had my first panic attack, I couldn't breath, I was shaking, my ears were ringing, I felt like I was going to die. Not to mention, the place where she ditched Amber, it was a neighborhood we didn't know, we don't know anyone there, we don't know their pets, we don't know anything. As far as we know, Amber could be dead, I don't want this to happen to Nibbles.

So in short, AITA for doing my best for my cat with what I have available to me right now, even tho I plan on treating him like a king the moment I move out?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-17,"AITA for not being able to bring my cat inside but doing the best I can for him anyways?

155,1e55f3k,AITA for not understanding how I am burdening my sister with my emotions?,"Hello, this is my first post, so please bear with me. I (20F) had an argument with my sister (22F) over a small incident at home yesterday. I accidentally burned my pinky while making a meal and let out an ""ah."" My sister responded with a monotonous ""sorry."" We are Nigerian (Yoruba), and in our culture, saying ""e rora/rora"" (be careful) or ""sorry"" with concern is common when someone gets hurt.
I can be a bit dramatic, often reacting loudly when hurt.
My sister usually responds with concern, but this time her tone seemed indifferent. I snapped at her, asking why she sounded like she didn't care. She explained she was busy and not paying attention. I felt hurt because it wasn't the first time this happened, and it seemed like she didn't care about my pain.
She later told me she felt burdened by having to constantly gauge my emotions and didn't like me snapping at her. I apologized for making her feel burdened and explained I didn't expect her to read my mind, just to show some concern when I was obviously hurt. She said she cares but finds it hard to always know when to be genuinely concerned.
We somewhat apologized to each other, but I still feel hurt and don't fully understand her perspective. I want to know if I was wrong in my actions and how to apologize and feel better without feeling uncared for.

Edit: Thank you to everyone who wrote a response, I didn’t think I would get any so I really appreciate it. I will take the opportunity to reevaluate myself and my emotions and how I navigate my relationships as to not make the same mistakes in the future. Navigating my emotions and how it might affect others is not something that comes easy for me but I desperately want to fix that problem so if anyone has any more advice on emotional regulation and understanding your emotions and being less reactive/dramatic I would love if you would be willing to share.
