0,1e6ap2l,AITA for arguing with my friend and insulting her when that's what she asked for?,"Hi Reddit, I‚Äôm a teen. My best friend, let‚Äôs call her C, goes to the same drama group as me, and our parents knew each other before, so we slowly became best friends.

But we‚Äôve had our testy moments‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm trans, and she outed me on a group chat filled with extremely transphobic individuals where I was flooded with slurs and abuse‚Ä¶and she JOINED IN. I felt betrayed. She apologized, and I forgave her because I value her so much as a friend, but I was still very hurt. Then the SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE. I was very upset again, she said the same things, and I forgave her because I love her so much (AS A FRIEND).

Recently, she‚Äôs become more toxic, making fun of things she knows are sensitive to me (like my voice), ignoring me when I say hello, frequently telling me to ‚Äúshut the fuck up‚Äù when I made ANY statement on a group chat she was on‚Ä¶and when I replied to her with ‚Äúno,‚Äù she threatened me. This got worse until I texted her a long message apologizing if I did anything wrong (I still have no idea what I did) and hoping we could still be friends. SHE LEFT ME ON READ, WHILE REPLYING TO OTHER MESSAGES ON GROUP CHATS I WAS ON. I thought this was the end of our friendship, so I was very upset. After getting many mutual friends to contact her to provoke a reply, she finally said I didn‚Äôt do anything and that she only didn‚Äôt reply because her phone broke. I knew this was a lie, as she had texted in this period on group chats and READ MY MESSAGE. For the past week, she has constantly been leaving me on read and ghosting me. When I saw her that weekend, she told me to go away so she could speak to the rest of our friends without me. She has literally addressed me as her best friend frequently.

Skip ahead a day, I turned my phone on to a group chat with about 5 people, including her, and she was mocking me, saying things like ‚ÄúMe and {MY DEADNAME, NOT EVEN MY REAL NAME} need to have an argument, or is that too barbaric for him {laughing emoji x 3}‚Äù I use she pronouns. I said I don‚Äôt like arguments, and she kept insisting we should. I said fine and launched into an argument, saying things like ‚Äúat least I don‚Äôt leave my friends on read‚Äù pulling up our conversation history, ‚Äúat least I don‚Äôt call my friends slurs‚Äù pulling up screenshots of those two times, ‚Äúat least I care about my supposedly best friends and don‚Äôt try to exclude them from their OWN FRIENDS.‚Äù Her response was she didn‚Äôt have to tell me everything, which is no excuse for telling me to go away from MY OWN FRIENDS. I just called her a bad friend. She felt really upset after that, and I said I didn‚Äôt mean any of it and was just giving her what she wanted, an argument. (I said before I said any of this that I wouldn‚Äôt mean what I was about to say). She says I hide behind a disclaimer and those were my true feelings.

I really don‚Äôt want to lose her as a friend. I think I overreacted and shouldn‚Äôt have argued with her. Try and see it from her perspective.

3,1e5y6wg,AITA for not buying expensive sandals for rest of my cousins after buying a pair for my favorite cousin?,"My parents and I are going on vacation back to their home country soon, and we‚Äôll be seeing our family. We last saw them two years ago, and during that time, I became really close friends with one of my cousins who has always been nice to me. After returning back from the holiday, she would occasionally ask me to bring her gifts the next time I visited. Although I sometimes felt like I was being used, I thought one gift would be fine, so I bought her a pair of Birkenstock sandals, and I also got a pair for myself.

While I was packing, my mom found both pairs in my luggage and was not happy about me gifting my cousin those sandals. She criticized my cousin for having the audacity to ask for such an expensive gift, pointing out that my other cousins wouldn‚Äôt have done the same and that these sandals could have been gifted to my mom or even my own sister. She argued that if I give these sandals to my cousin, my other cousins would envy her. However, I‚Äôm not close with my other cousins.

Additionally, my two other cousins have claimed that my favorite cousin is a ""wannabe rich girl"" and have shared these sentiments with my mom. They sound like they‚Äôre just jealous, and naturally, my mom sides with them since they‚Äôre closer to her. These other cousins are nice but not as outgoing and friendly toward me. One of these cousins is particularly hypocritical; she acts like a wannabe rich girl herself. She was my friend on Facebook in the past until she unadded me. Then two years ago, she added me again pretending not to know what happened, only to unadd me again after I left. This is especially disrespectful considering my mom is paying for her university tuition.

Now, this has become a bigger problem because my mom is insisting on buying sandals for my other cousins too. She doesn't want to cause any envy or issues within the family. I‚Äôm giving the second pair to my mom but now I feel obligated to buy another three pairs myself because I don‚Äôt want her to have to pay for them. This situation sucks because I never intended to buy so many pairs and it's a significant expense for me.

4,1e5y5jf,AITA for disagreeing with my brother's new relationship?,"I'm not much of a Reddit poster, so I apologize for any formatting problems in advance. I've only really engaged with AITA via podcast so I'm not sure how all this typically works. With that out of the way:

I (44F) have recently learned of a relationship between my older brother (52M) and my daughter's sister (31F). This girl is not my daughter and is not related to me or my brother in any way and I was never married to her father. I was in a relationship with him for less than a year that resulted in the birth of my daughter (23F). I have never considered this girl a daughter/step-daughter, despite her spending a lot of time with my daughter since they rekindled their sisterly relationship as adults. 

My brother met this girl at my niece's birthday party three years ago, as that's when my daughter started bringing her sister and her sister's son (7M) around to family events. When they started showing up more often, they were treated by my family just like any other cousins/grandkids/etc., even going as far as having the son call my brother ""uncle."" 

These past three years were fairly uneventful until my family's 4th of July party, where everyone was in attendance. This is where I was pulled aside by my daughter who told me that she had found her sister sending suggestive texts to my brother. She was weirded out by this and asked her sister what was going on. This is when her sister told her that months prior, they had exchanged numbers after flirting at the recent father's day cookout. She went further to tell me that her 7 year old nephew was aware of the relationship and expressed uncomfortability with his mom dating an uncle figure of his. 

I was immediately disgusted with my brother hearing all of this. I went to go have a talk with him, privately. I admit that I was interrogating him about this and could have been less aggressive, but I also think his reaction made my anger justified. After talking with him it was obvious that he had more hangups about the age gap in their relationship than the fact that they met via his niece at a family event. This led to me blurting out something to the effect of ""what are you going to do if it gets serious with this girl? are you going to marry her and have my daughter call you uncle brother-in-law?"" After hearing this, he just scowled and walked away. He spent the rest of the party sulking on the couch. 

After the party was over, my daughter called me and said that she overheard her sister on the phone with my brother, who was talking nastily about me. He was implying that I had no room to talk about ""appropriate relationships"" based on some bad guys I got mixed up with when I was in my 20s. I think it's different since he's 50 and doing these things now, when I've been in a healthy long-term relationship since I was 35.

Just for some backstory, my mom was a single mom for the first 13 or so years of my life, during that time she dated around until she found my stepdad (39M). I‚Äôm an only child, and throughout high school and college I have been a great student, hardly ever get into trouble, and stay involve with school clubs and my friends.

Since the end of high school and throughout my entire time in college, I feel like my mom has done everything she can to make me feel like I don‚Äôt spend enough time with her, hate talking to her, and just generally feel like I‚Äôm abandoning her.

I will admit, I spend a good amount of time with the GF, probably 4 out of the 7 days of the week, and we have an amazing relationship.

Recently, we were in the middle of a conversation and dinner, and she decided while I was in the middle of what I was saying to reach out and touch a bump on my wrist because she thought it was a bug bite. Since I was in the middle of a sentence and picking up a spoonful of my next bite, this threw me off guard and made me uncomfortable, so I said ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt touch my arm,‚Äù in a calm and neutral tone.

This becomes a full argument, and she starts throwing the usual insults of ‚ÄúI hope you don‚Äôt treat your girlfriend this way‚Äù and ‚ÄúI miss the old you‚Äù or ‚Äúyou were never like this growing up.‚Äù

we all got along pretty well until asswipe started showing signs of being a bad person. he was manipulative, claimed he was into agegaps, had a crush on birdie ( who was 17 at the time ), etc. we all collectively decided to remove him from the group, and continued being friends.

i got blocked by pancake, someone who i trusted with so many things, all because of me adding an old friend who i missed talking to. im much happier with birdee and the others now, but it still upsets me. i would go into more detail but theres a character limit. this is the basic summary, so; tell me reddit. am i the asshole?",0.0,0.107132226,0,1
7,1e5xyn1,WIBTA if I allow my friend to become homeless?,"For context, we‚Äôre in our mid 20s. 

I have a friend who i care deeply about, but I have grown very frustrated with them. Late summer 2023, their driving privileges were revoked. Nothing serious like drunk driving, just a consequence of speeding and failing to pay some fines. Around that time, I sold them an item for a negotiated price and agreed to take a deposit and payments (this is relevant for later). They continued to drive despite being revoked, and at the beginning of this year the car was totaled and I became their transportation. It was cheaper to give me gas money than it was to pay for a ride service, they lived about 25 minutes from work and I lived about 20 minutes from them. They arranged to move closer to work due to the lack of transportation which was also closer to me, which made it easier to take them places beyond walking distance. Things seemed okay until a couple months ago when they were (wrongfully) terminated from their job. During these months, I have been doing everything I can to help. Groceries, rides, resources, everything. I dont live with them, but on the outside it looks like they‚Äôve done nothing to change their circumstances. Their (very understanding and patient) landlord has started the conversation about the lack of payments and it was only then that they started to take things somewhat seriously and got to putting in job applications (but again, no transportation and no driving privileges). Here‚Äôs the real kicker: somehow they are able to scrape up enough money to travel hours away and attend multi-day events (with a plan to do it again in just a few weeks). They fully believe thats the right thing to be doing instead of putting that money towards their rent, staying home and applying for jobs, and coming up with a plan. Now, I am a firm believer that everyone deserves to experience fun and joy no matter their situation but at this point it feels like theirs is starting to cost me. I don‚Äôt have the finances to really support myself without help, let alone another grown adult. Remember that payment plan I mentioned earlier? They still owe me over half of what we agreed on. I haven‚Äôt made a big deal about it because responsibilities come first, but I‚Äôm watching them neglect those responsibilities to go to these events, knowing that they owe me money, and it seems like they aren‚Äôt even trying to resolve it. It‚Äôs looking like they are on the path towards homelessness, and I‚Äôm getting worried. They have not explicitly asked me if I‚Äôd be willing to let them stay with me if they need to, but based off of what they‚Äôve said, I can only assume they are hoping I will offer. I haven‚Äôt pushed the subject in asking them exactly what the plan is but from what I do know, i can‚Äôt say I am optimistic.

8,1e5xyel,AITA Moved Stray Dog across States?,"Family was on vacation. Last day, a Saturday at 9 AM in the morning packing car, we noticed a small dog cowering by the side of the road. The road was heavy residential traffic. Additionally a State HWY, with heavy traffic, was 100 yards away. The dog was across the street in the front yard of the house, literally on the edge of the road as cars zipped by at 30+ MPH. We crossed the street scooped up the dog and took it to the front door. The person answering the door said the dog was not his, and the dog had been there for some time. Multiple vets visited were closed as was the local SPCA. One Vet did scan the pooch and no chip.¬† Dog has no identifying information. Area is a popular vacation destination and dogs are included.

We asked the vet to keep the dog as we had a ten hour drive. Response was ""no they did not know what vaccinations this animal had, and it would put the other animals at risk in the kennel"". Further said it was common for animals to be left behind by vacationers. Neither the vet nor we thought to call animal control/police.¬†

The animal looked like it might have been homeless for a few days. Not healthy looking. Emaciated and hair appeared to be falling out. Decided to take the dog home. Vet provided food/bowls. Also suggested search for SPCA's on our return trip for the pooch. Weather was not healthy for an animal, so decided to take the dog several states away.

Arriving home immediately began looking to re-home the animal as we could not keep it for a variety of reasons. Immediately were contacting our local shelters. Before our local shelters returned calls re-homed a sickly looking animal to loving home. Pooch is doing very well. Immediate plans for vet visit, spay, chipped, dog license.

Our local SPCA found the animal on a lost and found site and sent the information. The same time new owner found the same info. New owner/we both made effort to connect to the dog's prior owner. Once the dog was confirmed to be the same, discussions began on how to determine how to return the animal. Or keep it.

During the owner's search process Vet realized they had scanned the dog. Vet contacted owner and provided travel information we had given verbally. Unfortunately neither thought we needed to provide contact information due to negative chip scan. Travel destination was spread.¬† During the ""lost"" period many comments were posted stating we should not have taken the dog out of state, questioned why we did not do more, were we scammers, etc.

My husband, who‚Äôs come to this particular vacation spot, for more than 20 years (it‚Äôs ‚Äúhis‚Äù spot), is complaining that our vacation is ruined. He initially wanted to come here by caravan as we do every summer. I said no due to the poor hygienic standards at his favorite camp site.

10,1e5xrww,AITA for telling my husband I don‚Äôt trust him and don‚Äôt feel supported?,"First time poster here so please go easy on me. I‚Äôm married with 4 children, working full-time from home. My husband is active duty Navy with a standard 9-5 schedule, no deployments or duty at sea. His BAH pays the full cost for where we live, and I pay all of our household bills including groceries and all costs related to our children (childcare, clothes, shoes, diapers, toys, etc). He will occasionally ask if anything is needed when he runs to the store, but it‚Äôs usually small items. He pays for his personal bills and I pay for mine. I do pay our family phone bill as one of the household bills, without having access to the actual account, because he said he said he knows I will ‚Äúfind something to argue about.‚Äù 

On that topic, there was a recent occurrence where someone called him at early hours while it was still dark outside, multiple times (at least 8), and he said he genuinely didn‚Äôt know who she was and that nothing is going on. She texted him once between calls but when I asked to read what it said, he wouldn‚Äôt let me read it until he did. So, after I flipped out about it and left to cool off, he said he read the message and it was nothing, and that I could read it if I wanted to.

Since I work from home, I am again responsible for everything related to the children (school/daycare commutes, scheduling/attending all appointments) and I take care of our youngest full-time at home while I work my remote job.
