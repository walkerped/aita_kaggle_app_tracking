0,1e6ap2l,AITA for arguing with my friend and insulting her when that's what she asked for?,"Hi Reddit, I‚Äôm a teen. My best friend, let‚Äôs call her C, goes to the same drama group as me, and our parents knew each other before, so we slowly became best friends.

But we‚Äôve had our testy moments‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm trans, and she outed me on a group chat filled with extremely transphobic individuals where I was flooded with slurs and abuse‚Ä¶and she JOINED IN. I felt betrayed. She apologized, and I forgave her because I value her so much as a friend, but I was still very hurt. Then the SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE. I was very upset again, she said the same things, and I forgave her because I love her so much (AS A FRIEND).

Recently, she‚Äôs become more toxic, making fun of things she knows are sensitive to me (like my voice), ignoring me when I say hello, frequently telling me to ‚Äúshut the fuck up‚Äù when I made ANY statement on a group chat she was on‚Ä¶and when I replied to her with ‚Äúno,‚Äù she threatened me. This got worse until I texted her a long message apologizing if I did anything wrong (I still have no idea what I did) and hoping we could still be friends. SHE LEFT ME ON READ, WHILE REPLYING TO OTHER MESSAGES ON GROUP CHATS I WAS ON. I thought this was the end of our friendship, so I was very upset. After getting many mutual friends to contact her to provoke a reply, she finally said I didn‚Äôt do anything and that she only didn‚Äôt reply because her phone broke. I knew this was a lie, as she had texted in this period on group chats and READ MY MESSAGE. For the past week, she has constantly been leaving me on read and ghosting me. When I saw her that weekend, she told me to go away so she could speak to the rest of our friends without me. She has literally addressed me as her best friend frequently.

Skip ahead a day, I turned my phone on to a group chat with about 5 people, including her, and she was mocking me, saying things like ‚ÄúMe and {MY DEADNAME, NOT EVEN MY REAL NAME} need to have an argument, or is that too barbaric for him {laughing emoji x 3}‚Äù I use she pronouns. I said I don‚Äôt like arguments, and she kept insisting we should. I said fine and launched into an argument, saying things like ‚Äúat least I don‚Äôt leave my friends on read‚Äù pulling up our conversation history, ‚Äúat least I don‚Äôt call my friends slurs‚Äù pulling up screenshots of those two times, ‚Äúat least I care about my supposedly best friends and don‚Äôt try to exclude them from their OWN FRIENDS.‚Äù Her response was she didn‚Äôt have to tell me everything, which is no excuse for telling me to go away from MY OWN FRIENDS. I just called her a bad friend. She felt really upset after that, and I said I didn‚Äôt mean any of it and was just giving her what she wanted, an argument. (I said before I said any of this that I wouldn‚Äôt mean what I was about to say). She says I hide behind a disclaimer and those were my true feelings.

I really don‚Äôt want to lose her as a friend. I think I overreacted and shouldn‚Äôt have argued with her. Try and see it from her perspective.

3,1e5y6wg,AITA for not buying expensive sandals for rest of my cousins after buying a pair for my favorite cousin?,"My parents and I are going on vacation back to their home country soon, and we‚Äôll be seeing our family. We last saw them two years ago, and during that time, I became really close friends with one of my cousins who has always been nice to me. After returning back from the holiday, she would occasionally ask me to bring her gifts the next time I visited. Although I sometimes felt like I was being used, I thought one gift would be fine, so I bought her a pair of Birkenstock sandals, and I also got a pair for myself.

While I was packing, my mom found both pairs in my luggage and was not happy about me gifting my cousin those sandals. She criticized my cousin for having the audacity to ask for such an expensive gift, pointing out that my other cousins wouldn‚Äôt have done the same and that these sandals could have been gifted to my mom or even my own sister. She argued that if I give these sandals to my cousin, my other cousins would envy her. However, I‚Äôm not close with my other cousins.

Additionally, my two other cousins have claimed that my favorite cousin is a ""wannabe rich girl"" and have shared these sentiments with my mom. They sound like they‚Äôre just jealous, and naturally, my mom sides with them since they‚Äôre closer to her. These other cousins are nice but not as outgoing and friendly toward me. One of these cousins is particularly hypocritical; she acts like a wannabe rich girl herself. She was my friend on Facebook in the past until she unadded me. Then two years ago, she added me again pretending not to know what happened, only to unadd me again after I left. This is especially disrespectful considering my mom is paying for her university tuition.

Now, this has become a bigger problem because my mom is insisting on buying sandals for my other cousins too. She doesn't want to cause any envy or issues within the family. I‚Äôm giving the second pair to my mom but now I feel obligated to buy another three pairs myself because I don‚Äôt want her to have to pay for them. This situation sucks because I never intended to buy so many pairs and it's a significant expense for me.

4,1e5y5jf,AITA for disagreeing with my brother's new relationship?,"I'm not much of a Reddit poster, so I apologize for any formatting problems in advance. I've only really engaged with AITA via podcast so I'm not sure how all this typically works. With that out of the way:

I (44F) have recently learned of a relationship between my older brother (52M) and my daughter's sister (31F). This girl is not my daughter and is not related to me or my brother in any way and I was never married to her father. I was in a relationship with him for less than a year that resulted in the birth of my daughter (23F). I have never considered this girl a daughter/step-daughter, despite her spending a lot of time with my daughter since they rekindled their sisterly relationship as adults. 

My brother met this girl at my niece's birthday party three years ago, as that's when my daughter started bringing her sister and her sister's son (7M) around to family events. When they started showing up more often, they were treated by my family just like any other cousins/grandkids/etc., even going as far as having the son call my brother ""uncle."" 

These past three years were fairly uneventful until my family's 4th of July party, where everyone was in attendance. This is where I was pulled aside by my daughter who told me that she had found her sister sending suggestive texts to my brother. She was weirded out by this and asked her sister what was going on. This is when her sister told her that months prior, they had exchanged numbers after flirting at the recent father's day cookout. She went further to tell me that her 7 year old nephew was aware of the relationship and expressed uncomfortability with his mom dating an uncle figure of his. 

I was immediately disgusted with my brother hearing all of this. I went to go have a talk with him, privately. I admit that I was interrogating him about this and could have been less aggressive, but I also think his reaction made my anger justified. After talking with him it was obvious that he had more hangups about the age gap in their relationship than the fact that they met via his niece at a family event. This led to me blurting out something to the effect of ""what are you going to do if it gets serious with this girl? are you going to marry her and have my daughter call you uncle brother-in-law?"" After hearing this, he just scowled and walked away. He spent the rest of the party sulking on the couch. 

After the party was over, my daughter called me and said that she overheard her sister on the phone with my brother, who was talking nastily about me. He was implying that I had no room to talk about ""appropriate relationships"" based on some bad guys I got mixed up with when I was in my 20s. I think it's different since he's 50 and doing these things now, when I've been in a healthy long-term relationship since I was 35.

Just for some backstory, my mom was a single mom for the first 13 or so years of my life, during that time she dated around until she found my stepdad (39M). I‚Äôm an only child, and throughout high school and college I have been a great student, hardly ever get into trouble, and stay involve with school clubs and my friends.

Since the end of high school and throughout my entire time in college, I feel like my mom has done everything she can to make me feel like I don‚Äôt spend enough time with her, hate talking to her, and just generally feel like I‚Äôm abandoning her.

I will admit, I spend a good amount of time with the GF, probably 4 out of the 7 days of the week, and we have an amazing relationship.

Recently, we were in the middle of a conversation and dinner, and she decided while I was in the middle of what I was saying to reach out and touch a bump on my wrist because she thought it was a bug bite. Since I was in the middle of a sentence and picking up a spoonful of my next bite, this threw me off guard and made me uncomfortable, so I said ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt touch my arm,‚Äù in a calm and neutral tone.

This becomes a full argument, and she starts throwing the usual insults of ‚ÄúI hope you don‚Äôt treat your girlfriend this way‚Äù and ‚ÄúI miss the old you‚Äù or ‚Äúyou were never like this growing up.‚Äù

we all got along pretty well until asswipe started showing signs of being a bad person. he was manipulative, claimed he was into agegaps, had a crush on birdie ( who was 17 at the time ), etc. we all collectively decided to remove him from the group, and continued being friends.

i got blocked by pancake, someone who i trusted with so many things, all because of me adding an old friend who i missed talking to. im much happier with birdee and the others now, but it still upsets me. i would go into more detail but theres a character limit. this is the basic summary, so; tell me reddit. am i the asshole?",0.0,0.107132226,0,1
7,1e5xyn1,WIBTA if I allow my friend to become homeless?,"For context, we‚Äôre in our mid 20s. 

I have a friend who i care deeply about, but I have grown very frustrated with them. Late summer 2023, their driving privileges were revoked. Nothing serious like drunk driving, just a consequence of speeding and failing to pay some fines. Around that time, I sold them an item for a negotiated price and agreed to take a deposit and payments (this is relevant for later). They continued to drive despite being revoked, and at the beginning of this year the car was totaled and I became their transportation. It was cheaper to give me gas money than it was to pay for a ride service, they lived about 25 minutes from work and I lived about 20 minutes from them. They arranged to move closer to work due to the lack of transportation which was also closer to me, which made it easier to take them places beyond walking distance. Things seemed okay until a couple months ago when they were (wrongfully) terminated from their job. During these months, I have been doing everything I can to help. Groceries, rides, resources, everything. I dont live with them, but on the outside it looks like they‚Äôve done nothing to change their circumstances. Their (very understanding and patient) landlord has started the conversation about the lack of payments and it was only then that they started to take things somewhat seriously and got to putting in job applications (but again, no transportation and no driving privileges). Here‚Äôs the real kicker: somehow they are able to scrape up enough money to travel hours away and attend multi-day events (with a plan to do it again in just a few weeks). They fully believe thats the right thing to be doing instead of putting that money towards their rent, staying home and applying for jobs, and coming up with a plan. Now, I am a firm believer that everyone deserves to experience fun and joy no matter their situation but at this point it feels like theirs is starting to cost me. I don‚Äôt have the finances to really support myself without help, let alone another grown adult. Remember that payment plan I mentioned earlier? They still owe me over half of what we agreed on. I haven‚Äôt made a big deal about it because responsibilities come first, but I‚Äôm watching them neglect those responsibilities to go to these events, knowing that they owe me money, and it seems like they aren‚Äôt even trying to resolve it. It‚Äôs looking like they are on the path towards homelessness, and I‚Äôm getting worried. They have not explicitly asked me if I‚Äôd be willing to let them stay with me if they need to, but based off of what they‚Äôve said, I can only assume they are hoping I will offer.

Most of the girls‚Äô parents thanked me and my husband for hosting and said positive things, but one texted me a list of all the things I did wrong.

The first thing that upset this mom was the fact that my daughter and her friends went swimming in our backyard pool. When the sleepover invites were sent out via text message, I asked the moms if they were okay with their girls going swimming. All of them said ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúthat‚Äôs okay with me‚Äù except for the complaining mom, who simply liked my text. I assumed this meant yes.

Additionally, my husband completed a lifeguarding course from the Red Cross and passed with flying colors. The mom‚Äôs second issue was the food the girls ate, which she deemed unhealthy. I however, did not see an issue with this because I think eating junk at sleepovers is okay. The next issue was the movie the girls watched after dinner. Since some of the girls are 14 and others are 15, we told them no R rated movies, but other than that it was up to them.

I‚Äôm honestly at a crossroads cause he‚Äôs not always like that, but I hate that side of him and the version of me that matches it, I just want him to stop being so angry over such little things and so fucking mean as a result. He has so many great qualities, but that side of him is just too much sometimes, that version of me doesnt exist unless I feel threatened or bullied, yet he‚Äôll try to make me seem crazy in the moment and say that I‚Äôm the aggressor, and pretty much derails every argument with the tactic of picking apart my own anger like it was there from the get go and not a defense against his.",0.0,0.022424178197979927,0,1

I moved with my now husband to a different country because I love him and I couldn't manage to live under the toxic environment at my parents house (For this I didn't receive any help from my parents and switched countries with about $300 in my pocket).

I brought my dog with me, against my mom's wishes as she wanted me to leave my dog with her. Unfortunately my dog couldn't adjust to the weather of this country and she got really depressed, also she got sick multiple times and I took her to the vet each time.

22,1e6o61f,AITA for wanting my painting to be a present from me and not my bf too?,"I‚Äôve been with my bf for just over a year and we‚Äôre about to go on holiday for his cousin‚Äôs 5 year wedding anniversary. I wasn‚Äôt at the original wedding but it‚Äôs a beautiful destination and around 30 people are attending.

A family/friends holiday is a huge deal to me as I have a small family that doesn‚Äôt do this sort of thing. I feel grateful that I was allowed to join the holiday when at the time I was essentially a stranger to them all. I‚Äôve met most of them since.

I‚Äôve been brainstorming what I could do for an anniversary present. As a fair artist, I only really do art for gifts to my family and kinda seemed appropriate here, so I asked my boyfriend to provide pics of their wedding day. I‚Äôm a pencil artist but committed myself to doing a fair sized acrylic painting, with no experience. I‚Äôve spent hours watching YouTube videos on painting techniques and colour mixing. I haven‚Äôt just banged this out, I‚Äôve been researching and spending time and money to buying art supplies because I just don‚Äôt paint! All in all I spent about ¬£65. 

My issue arises when I first mentioned doing a painting. He thought it was thoughtful, but one of the first comments was ‚Äògreat, now I don‚Äôt have to get a present‚Äô. Ngl my reaction was wtf? But I let it slide. Since then I‚Äôve gently suggested paying to get the picture framed, or maybe getting some other gifts for a hamper so we could gift it from both of us.

It came to a bit of a head today because he said he couldn‚Äôt find any frames. He did say he needed to go and get a card ‚Äòand stuff‚Äô on Saturday, to which I said oh I don‚Äôt need a card, I‚Äôm going to write a short note. He passively aggressively said ‚Äòyeah let‚Äôs just act like we‚Äôre not together on holiday, that‚Äôs a good idea‚Äô. He went off that couples give gifts together and he ‚Äòhates the way that I think‚Äô because he put my name on his card he wrote to his mum on Mother‚Äôs Day. He says shit like ‚Äòthis is the small shit that you get annoyed at?‚Äô But that‚Äôs his answer to any issue I have, so all my problems are small? 

My problem is, he didn‚Äôt commission the painting, it wasn‚Äôt even his idea, he thought that because I was putting a lot of effort in, he could just sit back and do nothing? I said that I was grateful to be included in their celebration and he said but I‚Äôm the one who invited you not them?

His stance is couples always gift stuff together, everybody there would know that he didn‚Äôt do the painting, so I would get the credit anyway and I have a selfish way of thinking (really I just want us both to put in effort?)

I‚Äôve been with my bf for just over a year and we‚Äôre about to go on holiday for his cousin‚Äôs 5 year wedding anniversary. I wasn‚Äôt at the original wedding but it‚Äôs a beautiful destination and around 30 people are attending.

A family/friends holiday is a huge deal to me as I have a small family that doesn‚Äôt do this sort of thing. I feel grateful that I was allowed to join the holiday when at the time I was essentially a stranger to them all. I‚Äôve met most of them since.

I‚Äôve been brainstorming what I could do for an anniversary present. As a fair artist, I only really do art for gifts to my family and kinda seemed appropriate here, so I asked my boyfriend to provide pics of their wedding day. I‚Äôm a pencil artist but committed myself to doing a fair sized acrylic painting, with no experience. I‚Äôve spent hours watching YouTube videos on painting techniques and colour mixing. I haven‚Äôt just banged this out, I‚Äôve been researching and spending time and money to buying art supplies because I just don‚Äôt paint! All in all I spent about ¬£65. 

My issue arises when I first mentioned doing a painting. He thought it was thoughtful, but one of the first comments was ‚Äògreat, now I don‚Äôt have to get a present‚Äô. Ngl my reaction was wtf? But I let it slide. Since then I‚Äôve gently suggested paying to get the picture framed, or maybe getting some other gifts for a hamper so we could gift it from both of us.

It came to a bit of a head today because he said he couldn‚Äôt find any frames. He did say he needed to go and get a card ‚Äòand stuff‚Äô on Saturday, to which I said oh I don‚Äôt need a card, I‚Äôm going to write a short note. He passively aggressively said ‚Äòyeah let‚Äôs just act like we‚Äôre not together on holiday, that‚Äôs a good idea‚Äô. He went off that couples give gifts together and he ‚Äòhates the way that I think‚Äô because he put my name on his card he wrote to his mum on Mother‚Äôs Day. He says shit like ‚Äòthis is the small shit that you get annoyed at?‚Äô But that‚Äôs his answer to any issue I have, so all my problems are small? 

My problem is, he didn‚Äôt commission the painting, it wasn‚Äôt even his idea, he thought that because I was putting a lot of effort in, he could just sit back and do nothing? I said that I was grateful to be included in their celebration and he said but I‚Äôm the one who invited you not them?

His stance is couples always gift stuff together, everybody there would know that he didn‚Äôt do the painting, so I would get the credit anyway and I have a selfish way of thinking (really I just want us both to put in effort?)

23,1e6nufo,AITA for wanting my brother to stop playing his music out loud?,"My (M18) brother (M21) and I have bedrooms right next to each other, and the wall between them is fairly thin. Every day he plays music out loud on his speakers. Although it isn't that loud, the bass travels through the walls and is loud enough to bother me. I like things to be quiet, and I especially don't like the feeling of someone else's stuff intruding on my room.

I've tried turning my fan on to max power but it doesn't complete block out the sound. White noise in my headphones works but often has to be so loud that I can't do anything else that requires sound. Playing my own music does work though. However, sometimes I just want it to be quiet, or I'm trying to sleep (I can't sleep with music playing), or I'm playing a game that is generally pretty quiet. When this happens there is nothing I can do to get rid of the sound.

I do ask him to turn the music down, but there a few problems. When I ask, he does turn it down, but not enough to not annoy me. He only turns it down enough when it's late at night and I'm trying to sleep (thankfully). He also doesn't continue over from previous days, and it always returns to the same volume no matter how many times I ask him to turn it down (which I've told him to stop doing but he doesn't listen). He also seems annoyed when I ask him which deters me from doing it because I dislike confrontation.

I've asked him to wear headphones, but he says he won't because he hates listening to music with headphones on. I think it's because the bass isn't loud enough and he can't walk around his room with them on or something. I honestly don't know the real reason.

I've asked my parents to try to do something about it, but they just tell me that I should ignore it and that it doesn't matter and that I'm asking for too much.

26,1e6njhr,AITA for telling my friend that I didn't like her bfs behavior too late?,"So, about a month ago I went to visit my friend in a different state. She and I were decently close and I was to stay with her and her boyfriend at their apartment for 4 days. 

I met her BF once a year prior and we had pretty obvious personality clashes.

 Anyways, when I was there he referred to the both of us as ""you b*tches"" and called me a ""wh*re"" and even brought up a few intimate details about my friend in front of us. It made me pretty uncomfortable, especially the way he repeatedly called us ""b*tches""

He also directly told me to ""stfu"" 

Now, admittedly, I did say some negative umbrella comments about men and ""male ignorance"" a few times. It was dumb, I could see why that would make him uncomfortable and I was in his apartment and should have conducted myself a bit more respectfully. 

When I got home, only then did I tell my friend that I didn't appreciate his words and she told me that she didn't appreciate mine in return but proceeded to say that he did nothing wrong and that his comments were ""benign"" and the result of ""an edgy sense of humor."" She also didn't seem to mind about him mentioning private details about her in front of us. 

I know that I should have set up boundaries first thing, but I still feel that he shouldn't have talked that way to me regardless. She was upset at me for not doing so but also didn't tell me that she didn't agree with my comments until later too. So we both only spoke our minds until it was all over. 

She's not friends with me anymore because of it all, but I can't help but feel like she just completely undermined me. I know I could have done a few things differently. 

For context, he's 24, she's 20, and I'm 19. So we're all pretty young.

30,1e6n093,"AITA if I got my friend to build a fence didnt deliver in full, I question it and asked to work with me on pricing after he fixed it and charged me more?","So i got a friend I have known since kindergarten to build my fence.  I was estanged from him a bit in my 20s but we got back in touch.  He had a girlfriend with a daughter the same age as my older son (7) and our families would hang out.  I have used him before for some stuff as he is a great carpenter.  

We agreed on the work as i wanted to have concrete up to the top at ground level per fence post.  He had asked me twice how many bags of concrete i wanted in each hole on two different occasions.  I told him each time to fill it to the top.  He seemed unsure the second time so i just asked him.  Is everything clear?  I dont want to be on different pages.  He said ""yes i was just thinking about everything i have to do is all.  The fence looked awesome.  We had a huge rainfall and i saw a bunch of pooling at some of the posts.  I took a stick and stuck it down the water and i felt 18 inches before hitting the concrete.  I texted him about it and he called me back immediately.  I told him about the pooling and that the reason i had asked for it was because i didnt want to replace posts over and over like i had been doing with the current fence that was there when i moved in.  

So he told me that he could fix it.  I asked how and he told me that he would dig down, clear to the concrete, put a bonding agent and tapcons and then add sonotubes and add concrete so it would adhere.  I  was like awesome that sounds like a plan.

So a week goes by and he told him that hes coming to fix it the next day.  I was away but i said thats great.  He does the work and then sends me a message that he worked for free but he needed another 300 for sonotubes and concrete and the worker he brought with him would be an extra 400.  I questioned it because i said that if it was done when the holes were dug it wouldnt have been an issue.  I was more than willing to pay for the concrete and what not but this was made more complex because they didnt do what i asked.  I just asked if we could talk about it since i dont want to screw him either.  

About 15 min goes by and i got a message from his girlfriend saying ""youre a greedy asshole.  have fun on your vacation, prick""  I was so shocked by this I didnt know what to do.   I texted him a screen shot and told him that i just wanted to talk about it.  I wasnt trying to screw him over.  He told me that he had no idea she did that and was pissed.

so AITA for even questioning it in the first place?  The price he gave me was the same as another quote so I just went with him.  But after all this it came over by 700.  He is a good bro.  I dont know how to handle the gf situation either. 

Also........yes.  I realize that I shouldnt use friends for work.  Lesson learned.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-18,"AITA if I got my friend to build a fence didnt deliver in full, I question it and asked to work with me on pricing after he fixed it and charged me more? So i got a friend I have known since kindergarten to build my fence.  I was estanged from him a bit in my 20s but we got back in touch.  He had a girlfriend with a daughter the same age as my older son (7) and our families would hang out.  I have used him before for some stuff as he is a great carpenter.  

We agreed on the work as i wanted to have concrete up to the top at ground level per fence post.  He had asked me twice how many bags of concrete i wanted in each hole on two different occasions.  I told him each time to fill it to the top.  He seemed unsure the second time so i just asked him.  Is everything clear?  I dont want to be on different pages.  He said ""yes i was just thinking about everything i have to do is all.  The fence looked awesome.  We had a huge rainfall and i saw a bunch of pooling at some of the posts.  I took a stick and stuck it down the water and i felt 18 inches before hitting the concrete.  I texted him about it and he called me back immediately.  I told him about the pooling and that the reason i had asked for it was because i didnt want to replace posts over and over like i had been doing with the current fence that was there when i moved in.  

So he told me that he could fix it.  I asked how and he told me that he would dig down, clear to the concrete, put a bonding agent and tapcons and then add sonotubes and add concrete so it would adhere.  I  was like awesome that sounds like a plan.

So a week goes by and he told him that hes coming to fix it the next day.  I was away but i said thats great.  He does the work and then sends me a message that he worked for free but he needed another 300 for sonotubes and concrete and the worker he brought with him would be an extra 400.  I questioned it because i said that if it was done when the holes were dug it wouldnt have been an issue.

31,1e6mj2i,AITA for dropping my friend bc they were extremely negative and refused to change?,"DISCLAIMER! this is an old story, and I want to make that clear. I can‚Äôt give much detail about this persons life or mine so i‚Äôm not going to give a lot of details i‚Äôm sorry if it makes this confusing.

In high school, I had a friend who we will call Jane. We were very close for four years. Jane had a tough home life and often faced difficult situations. Whenever she needed support, I was there for her, even having her stay with my family on some occasions. However, when I needed Jane, whether it was to talk about my problems or just for support, she would always shift the focus to herself and her issues.

For example, during a depressive episode, I called Jane for support, but she barely listened and quickly started talking about her own problems. When something good happened to me, like getting my driver‚Äôs license, Jane would get upset because she couldn‚Äôt get hers due to her parents. It felt like Jane only reached out to me when she was upset and needed someone to listen. I was more like her therapist, always offering support but never receiving any in return. I understood her difficult home life and didn‚Äôt want to be mean, so I stayed supportive.

In sophomore year, I started taking medication for my depression and began to heal. I realized that Jane‚Äôs negativity was affecting me. When I told her about my antidepressants, she was sad because she couldn‚Äôt get medicated. I tried to comfort her, but I started noticing overtime how her constant negativity was dragging me down. Near the end of junior year, I decided to take some space from her. I always encouraged her to be positive and to stop speaking negatively about herself, as she was beautiful. Despite my efforts, her negativity persisted, affecting not just me but others around her too.

Eventually, I stopped talking to Jane. It was a hard decision because I cared about her, but her constant need for sympathy was overwhelming. One day, Jane asked why I had distanced myself, and I told her the truth. I explained that her constant complaints and negativity were making it hard for me to be her friend. I felt more like her therapist than a real friend. I told her that she needed to break her negative cycle because it wasn‚Äôt helping her. Jane apologized but said she couldn‚Äôt bring herself to change because being positive never brought her any good. She told me that she has tried but it never worked out so she just gave up and accepted her life. I explained that good things take time and that if she refused to change, I couldn‚Äôt continue our friendship as it was affecting my mental health.

33,1e6mdd6,WIBTA for not allowing my boyfriend's family's pets in our home?,"My boyfriend and I are thinking about moving in together and we're discussing logistics. I for example grew up in a household where we didn't wear shoes in the house, and even though he didn't he's willing to try it for me.

One thing we can't get past is an issue with his family and extended family, who all own cats and/or dogs. I visit them, play with the animals, and enjoy my time there. Their animals are not super well potty trained and sometimes have accidents on the floor. They wipe it up and for them it's no big deal. When they visit each other for more than a couple of hours, the guests (all part of the same extended family) bring their animals with them and they have the run of the house, getting on the host's couches, beds, chairs, whatever. The cats climb tables. There really seems to be no limit and the hosts don't seem to mind, they do the same with their animals when they visit the guests.

When I asked what will happen when his family/extended family visit our apartment, my boyfriend has said this will be the case in our apartment too. I was shocked! I love these animals but I don't like the idea of them running all over our apartment, our furniture, getting their fur on things, and potentially going to the bathroom wherever they please. My boyfriend is used to this, and for him it's no big deal.

While I can't imagine allowing this to happen, I did ask if he's willing to clean up after his family. He said his family usually would wipe up any mess their pet made (though they just wipe it up with a paper towel, I would need it to be disinfected which he thinks is overkill and something he is not willing to do.) I would need to do anything beyond that myself, because he doesn't have a problem with fur or germs trekked in from the outside. I asked him what will even be the point of us taking off our shoes if these animals are going to put their feet and more on everything?

Note that his family wears shoes in the house. He said most of them might be willing to take their shoes off at our door but they would think of it as an imposition and think I was weird for asking guests to do something they might prefer not to.

I understand that this is going to be his apartment too, and it's his family, but I won't be comfortable in my own home if this is allowed to happen. I don't understand why they would feel entitled to have their animals have the run of our apartment.

It seems like this is the cost of entry into this family. He says he doesn't know why I'm making such a big deal about it. And that his family will think I'm a gigantic AH and animal hater since the alternative would be them leaving their pets at home for long periods of time. They see the idea of paying for pet care as ridiculous. I told him I don't know why it's on me when they are the ones who decided to have pets and he said that mentality is not what family's about.

36,1e6m5fh,AITA for not going through an unofficial sublease agreement?,"I was never making money off of this property as I have to advertise the rent as what the landlord was originally giving me.

I signed a lease for an apartment but ended up trying to sublease it because I got a job elsewhere. I found one person (lets call them Bob) and we talked and agreed that I would pay them some amount per month to reduce the rent (I was desperate to sublease). I also had Bob call the landlord to make sure everything is okay and they agreed that it would be fine and the landlord explained to them that their leases dont incorporate outside deals. On multiple occasions I said that I would talk to the landlord first.

I wanted to get a contract made to make Bob assured that I would pay them. I assumed Bob wouldnt sign anything anyway without this extra contract.

I was down to pay Bob to reduce the monthly rent, but someone else (lets call them Amy) messaged me the morning before I was going to talk to the landlord about the deal with Bob and Amy said they would pay full price by the end of the day. Anyone in my position would prefer to spend 500 dollars instead of 5000, so naturally, I planned on giving Amy the unit instead. I did not tell Bob that I did not speak to the landlord.

For context, when the landlord found someone who wanted my lease once prior, they sent me their information first. While I did know Bob, I never told my landlord their name or that I wanted to sublease to them. Bob just mentioned my name to the landlord. Apparently Bob had received documents and signed them the night I changed my mind, assuming that I had spoke to the landlord. I never consented to letting the landlord give lease documents to someone without my approval. I have audio of the manager saying i signed nothing allowing them to give someone a sublease without my approval. They did it out of ""courtesy"". However, they signed a lease that was generated before and did not have our most recent deal anyway so it wasn't even our agreement and it lead to me getting kicked out early even though I have class for another month.

I then offered to pay Bob any fees associated (and 100 dollars more for the inconvenience) with transferring to Amy, but they did not listen to what I said and lied to the landlord that I was trying to force them to leave the apartment. The landlord manager called me and talked over me, not letting me get my point across and said I should just sign over the unit. At this point, I was so frustrated with both of these people so I signed the lease transfer. I told Bob I would not pay them anything other than any transfer fees to Amy and Bob hasnt responded since.

Now I am off scott free and Bob has to pay about 5000 more than what they thought they would pay.

At this point I‚Äôm gonna also note the age difference, I‚Äôm 26 yo working part time to finish my masters so I currently have half a salary, while they are 32-40 year olds with well adjusted lives. They respond through his best friend, him only reading the messages, that they are willing to ‚Äòdiscount‚Äô my share by 20 euros each, which brings it to 120 euros for me, which is a third of my salary. I clearly respond by telling them that there is no way I‚Äôm paying this amount for vacation I‚Äôm not gonna go, if money is really the issue here then the cancellation is free yet, and we can all keep our money and seek for alternatives. Because I wanted the issue resolved I also offered to pay the amount that was mine divided by the 5 of us equally, so the economic burden is also equally divided, and they can have the vacation they want without me paying for it. Am I deluded to believe that when a person has to bail because of reasons out of their control, the rest of the group either splits the difference or cancels for free, given it is possible? Am I the asshole for not paying full price for vacation I‚Äôm not gonna go? ",0.0,0.01647188887000084,0,1

39,1e6ls16,AITA for making my family cancel their vacation because i wont watch their dogs?,"My parents (82M, 75F)  asked if I would help them book a much needed vacation. They also asked me to do the same for my brother (43) and SIL (33), because they wanted to take a family vacation in September. My husband (46) and I (41F) can't afford to go because i am currently out of a job. Even though this would be the first family vacation I will have ever missed and it made me really sad, I said I would of course help. My mom even mentioned to me that in a way it's good because I'd be able to watch my brother's pugs and my parents' chihuahua. 

Here's the thing about watching the dogs. It's a 24/7 job that requires me to stay at my brother's house. The dogs are wonderful, but very high maintenance. Because of this, I have been telling my brother for nearly 10 years that he needed to hire a dogsitter (money isn't an issue for him).

Ive dogsat for them 3 times this past year varying from 1 to 5 nights. They paid me well. But I do not feel comfortable staying at their house and I find the round the clock care exhausting. My husband and I have 5 cats, and we are no stranger to feeling like our pets are our kids, but we don't have dogs for a reason.  Now, I'm supposed to be booking this trip for my brother, but he hasn't even asked me about watching the dogs.

Sunday at family dinner, everyone is there except my SIL who was ill. My brother was sitting across from me so I reach out to hold his hand and say that I love him, I love the pugs, but I can't watch them when they go on vacation and that he needs to get a dogsitter. I said it was just too much to ask me to be trapped at their house for 7 nights, and that I have been asking him to hire a dogsitter for nearly a decade. I even offer suggestions and said I'll help find someone. 

He starts to get reactive and says that they won't watch my cats anymore. I said that's fine, we have a cat sitter, but I point out that I ask them if they can help. They, on the other hand, didn't ask me.

My brother finally concedes that it is a lot to ask 7 nights and 5 dogs. Excuse me? Yes, 5 dogs, because his MIL apparently was planning to go too. So now added to the mix are 2 Italian greyhounds. 

I stay calm and gently point out that I felt this way before knowing there were 5 dogs. Can he imagine how I felt? He seemed to understand. By the time I left dinner, there were hugs and kisses and all was well. I knew my brother was upset, but he seemed to understand and I was really proud of putting up boundaries.

The next evening, I call my parents to see if they have heard from my brother. Apparently he called them after he got home from family dinner and was ""blindsided"" by me. My SIL was just as upset as him too. They think I'm throwing a tantrum because I can't go on the vacation. While yes, that sucks, I told him my real issue is being trapped at their house for 7 nights. Now they are canceling the vacation bc I wont watch the dogs.

40,1e6lpes,AITA For Ruining A Relationship With My Best Friend Over A Girl,"So, me and this girl started dating in June 2023. We dated all the way up to this past June when I got really drunk and cheated on her. I fucked up big time. Anyway, we have this mutual friend who is my best friend; we have been really good friends for four years now. About two years ago, I was dating this other girl, and we broke up because my friend was trying to make a move on her, and then they dated. That really hurt me, but I made up with him because I didn‚Äôt want to lose my best friend over a girl I dated for four months.

Now back to the present: after my girl and I broke up, he and she were still friends, which was fine because they were friends before. But then, about a week later, they were both at a party, and there was a photo of them cuddling up together. The night before, I opened up to my friend about my dad, who passed the year prior. So I saw the photo and decided to send it to him and say, ""What the fuck?"" He said, ""What? It‚Äôs just a photo."" So I was like, ""You're cuddling up with my ex, bro. We broke up a week ago. That‚Äôs fucked up."" Then I just kept telling him how it was fucked up, but he kept saying, ""We didn‚Äôt do anything. If you think I want her, I don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs on you."" Then he said, ""I‚Äôm not talking about this stupid ass photo with you."" So I told him, ""I opened up to you about my dead dad, but you can‚Äôt even talk to me about a stupid ass photo?"" I think I went a little too far there, but I was just so angry.

Anyway, the day after, he responds and says, ""Are you mad at me?"" So I sent a big paragraph just telling him how I feel, saying, ""Well yeah, I‚Äôm mad, and I think I‚Äôve got a good reason too. You‚Äôre cuddling up with my ex, and you did this before with the other girl."" And he was like, ""It‚Äôs not like that at all, bro. You‚Äôre taking it the wrong way."" So I said, ""You really don‚Äôt think you're in the wrong at all?"" And he says, ""Explain it to me more so I can understand."" And I said, ""I sent three paragraphs to you. What more do you want me to explain? All you have been doing is just giving me dry ass answers and making the whole thing about you when I‚Äôm trying to tell you how I feel."" 

Then he was like, ""It‚Äôs not that deep."" So I left him on read, and we haven‚Äôt talked since about 2 weeks. I really lost my best friend over a girl.

44,1e6lfsd,WIBTA for confronting neighbor about dog poop?,"My husband and I have lived here for almost 6 years (come November) and have never had an issue with any of our neighbors what so ever ( and none of them are new, aside from the rentals across the street), so it comes as complete shock to me that when we got home from work we found a bag of dog crap directly in our driveway where we park the car. I was immediately in detective mode, as our trash can was literally by the curb if someone wanted to throw their dog poop in there instead of keeping on walking with it.

Onto the investigation:

I checked our front camera (an off-brand ring doorbell that's wired to the house) and somehow the camera didn't catch whodunnit, but I had a timestamp of 8:04 AM. So I checked the garage camera, which points up the driveway and noticed one of our neighbors tossing the offending bad before walking away.

Now, I know when people walk their dogs and leave their 'presents' behind, that if you know who did it this kind of behavior follows suit. The problem here is we don't own a dog. And she literally walked past her own trash can to throw the offending thing in our yard.

My husband and I are baffled by this behavior - we have never had beef with anyone, and it's just so bizarre. The only thing we can think of is that she did this in retaliation for the feral cats that myself, and our immediate next door neighbor, are tending to (I mean, the TNR cat I saw last October is the literal reason WHY we even have the cameras on the house now). My husband and I are usually non-confrontational, but my day was already shitty so this only fueled my rage, so I want to confront her about this in a polite way, because what if she mistakenly thinks we own a dog and didn't clean up? My husband thinks she KNOWS what she did and it's not dog poop, but is instead cat poop, and she is retaliating for the small colony between the two houses (which the other neighbor has told me he is working on getting picked up and rehomed).

Is this an AH move? IMO, if you are to tall or fat, you need to book seats, which makes you not get in the way of other passengers, and if you fail to do so, it is on you if you are uncomfortable.",1.0,1.0554300546646118,1,1

The artist's audience is mostly teenage to early 30‚Äôs women. When I informed my parents (who I'm living with during breaks), we got into a string of arguments.¬†

Now, since I‚Äôm still financially dependent on my parents, I‚Äôd totally understand and cancel my plans (the ticket would sell easily) if they object about money. I live in Toronto, Canada, so plane tickets, hotel bills, etc. will all have to be taken into account. They unsurprisingly had no issue with the estimated total expense I presented to them, since we're *very* well-off and they've bought me far more expensive things on a whim despite my protests.

Their concern was my safety, odd because I already attend university in a faraway American city (although, I should add that my mother‚Äôs said repeatedly that she contemplated buying an apartment near my uni so she could ‚Äútake care of me‚Äù), and have never gotten into trouble. The concert venue is downtown with many nearby hotels. I assured them I don‚Äôt plan on doing anything other than attending the concert itself, but they insisted on paying for my older brother (24M who still lives with us) to go to the concert with me, which would be humiliating given the artist's target audience. My brother was obviously not thrilled.

Later, my parents suggested the whole family go to California for ‚Äúvacation‚Äù, during which I could attend the concert alone. This is, frustratingly, a recurring pattern; they‚Äôd insist on family trips to places that *conveniently* happen to be where events I‚Äôd attend were held. Last summer, when I wanted to see an artist in Buffalo, the entire family drove there by car and stayed overnight. The overprotectiveness extended to other areas as well. Aside from the aforementioned uni comment, my mother kept half-joking about moving to wherever I‚Äôd work once I graduate. They were never this protective of my brother, who got to go on overseas trips (admittedly within groups) at 13 when we still lived in China.

I've had enough and told them I respect their concerns, so if they're truly worried, I won't go. My parents stuck to the painfully obvious lie that they just wanted to visit California, apparently so that we could go to Vegas and ‚Äúhave fun in casinos‚Äù.

If they wanted to go on vacation, fine, but I‚Äôd sell my ticket so they can't continue to disrespect my agency. They said I was making a big deal out of nothing.

WIBTA if I sell my ticket? I know I may seem ungrateful since it's their money and a family trip doesn‚Äôt sound bad if you disregard the context.

50,1e6kjd9,AITA for not telling my mom that I found out my dad is most likely cheating?,"
So, 2 days ago I (F19) found out that my dad is most likely cheating on my mom. I had to use my dad's phone for something related to an order he placed, and he reluctantly left his phone with me because he had somewhere to be, although he was hesistant. When I accidentally switched the typing letters to recent emojis, I saw these: üî•üëÑü´¶üíãüò´üò©üçí. My dad barely uses emojis, and when he does, it's usually just a thumbs-up or other basic ones. My heart dropped when I saw those emojis.

I checked his messages with friends and didn't see any of those emojis. Then I checked his App Store history and saw that he had a certain livestream app since 2011. It looked normal at first, but I still had a weird feeling. I also noticed he had a face lock on his deleted pictures and on his App Store purchases history.

Later, I downloaded the livestream app on my phone, made an account, and logged in. I haven't been the same since. The app is full of webcam girls. I'm pretty sure he spends money on them and talks to them, given the coin system in the app. I feel disgusted, especially knowing he still has the app on his phone.

I can't look at him the same way. I feel guilty and disgusted for not telling my mom, but I just can't. They've been married for over 30 years, and we're also religious. This would not only damage our family but also affect our extended family. I've been crying and feeling so confused.

Today, my mom seemed a bit down, so I tried to be extra nice to her. When I asked her where my dad was, she said, ""With his lover, but I have made peace with that,"" with a straight face. We sometimes joke about my dad having another family, but this time it felt different.

54,1e6j9lv,UPDATE: AITA for telling my best friend I don‚Äôt want to hear about her shitty boyfriend anymore?,"Hi guys. My post got quite a lot of traction so I thought I would update you all. 

Firstly, thank you so much for everyone who commented and messaged me, nice or not, it was great to get everyone‚Äôs opinion. 

So I wrote Kayla a letter, like I said I was going to in my edit. It felt very formal and weird to do, but for some reason doing it over text felt wrong. I wanted her to know I am sincere. I said that I love her, and I value our friendship extensively and apologised for the way I spoke to her. I said alcohol wasn‚Äôt to blame, I was. I spoke to her like an asshole and she didn‚Äôt deserve it. I wrote that I have felt frustrated about the situation for a long time now, because it upset me seeing her so frustrated and upset all the time with the person who is supposed to cherish and respect her the most. 

I told her that I wholeheartedly believe that she should end the relationship. I said I knew this wasn‚Äôt my place to say, and that she didn‚Äôt need to take my advise and that I would support her in whatever decision she made‚Äî but if she decided to stay with him, I need her to stop complaining to me about James and their relationship because it was too draining for me to hear it. I said of course she could talk to me about anything major, but hearing the same complaints on an almost daily basis was exhausting, especially when she wouldn‚Äôt take or even listen to any advise. 

I made sure to tell her I loved her and I apologised again (I actually apologised 4 times in the letter). I put it through her front door the day after I posted on here. 

She called me yesterday and asked to meet. I went round to her place last night, and we talked for just over two hours. She told me she actually broke up with James the day after my Birthday. Apparently me snapping at her about it shocked her into realising how often she was upset by him and how much she complained. She has spent the last few days processing everything, so that‚Äôs why I hadn‚Äôt heard from her (which is SO valid). She actually thanked me for doing it, which is crazy. She said although I was a bit of an asshole, it was what she needed to hear. We both cried and lot and hugged it out and then watched 90 Day Fianc√© lol. I think it‚Äôs safe to say we will be okay. She is obviously struggling because she is grieving their relationship, and breakups are awful. But I will support her through this, like I always do, because I know that she will support me when I next get my heart broken. (I am single af right now but who knows what the future holds).

So, the TLDR is that me snapping at my best friend at my Birthday dinner for complaining about her boyfriend for the whole meal caused her to dump him. I didn‚Äôt lose the friendship, I actually got my best friend BACK. I can‚Äôt wait to support her while she finds herself again. 

Thank you all again. Have a great day everyone „Ö§·µïÃà ",UPDATE,2024-07-18,"UPDATE: AITA for telling my best friend I don‚Äôt want to hear about her shitty boyfriend anymore? Hi guys. My post got quite a lot of traction so I thought I would update you all.

I spoke to her like an asshole and she didn‚Äôt deserve it. I wrote that I have felt frustrated about the situation for a long time now, because it upset me seeing her so frustrated and upset all the time with the person who is supposed to cherish and respect her the most. 

I told her that I wholeheartedly believe that she should end the relationship. I said I knew this wasn‚Äôt my place to say, and that she didn‚Äôt need to take my advise and that I would support her in whatever decision she made‚Äî but if she decided to stay with him, I need her to stop complaining to me about James and their relationship because it was too draining for me to hear it. I said of course she could talk to me about anything major, but hearing the same complaints on an almost daily basis was exhausting, especially when she wouldn‚Äôt take or even listen to any advise. 

I made sure to tell her I loved her and I apologised again (I actually apologised 4 times in the letter). I put it through her front door the day after I posted on here. 

She called me yesterday and asked to meet. I went round to her place last night, and we talked for just over two hours. She told me she actually broke up with James the day after my Birthday. Apparently me snapping at her about it shocked her into realising how often she was upset by him and how much she complained. She has spent the last few days processing everything, so that‚Äôs why I hadn‚Äôt heard from her (which is SO valid). She actually thanked me for doing it, which is crazy. She said although I was a bit of an asshole, it was what she needed to hear. We both cried and lot and hugged it out and then watched 90 Day Fianc√© lol. I think it‚Äôs safe to say we will be okay. She is obviously struggling because she is grieving their relationship, and breakups are awful. But I will support her through this, like I always do, because I know that she will support me when I next get my heart broken. (I am single af right now but who knows what the future holds).

So, the TLDR is that me snapping at my best friend at my Birthday dinner for complaining about her boyfriend for the whole meal caused her to dump him. I didn‚Äôt lose the friendship, I actually got my best friend BACK. I can‚Äôt wait to support her while she finds herself again. 

Thank you all again. Have a great day everyone „Ö§·µïÃà ",,1.0485321283340454,1,0
55,1e6j5w7,AITA for telling my cousin and his wife that they need to grow up and be adults?,"I (17F) have never been close with my cousins or their children. I am the youngest cousin of 10, so I have never been interested in becoming close with them. I usually just stick to myself, but my mother (48F) has a pretty bad habit of being too nice. Around 6 years ago, my aunt (53F) was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer and my mom invited her into our home to stay. I of course had no issue with this, and even if I did I was 11 and didn‚Äôt really have a say. My aunt and her husband have been living with us on and off my entire life, so i‚Äôm used to it. 

Fast forward to November 2023, two of her grandchildren began living with us due to financial issues and some abusive treatments that they endured with their parents. I was a bit peeved, as I wasn‚Äôt used to being around a 4 year old and a 10 year old. However I sucked it up. Then only a couple months later at the end of January, my cousin and his wife (both late 30s) came to stay with us too. They needed somewhere to stay for a week. Well of course that didn‚Äôt end up happening, and my mom being who she is has let them stay since then. They‚Äôre awful houseguests. They eat everything, go days and sometimes weeks without bathing, and if we didn‚Äôt do anything would let the house become filthy. 

All of this doesn‚Äôt really affect me because I tend to stay in my room most of the time. The main problem is that they also brought their other child with them last month, a 12 year old that has a tendency to try to be mommy to her younger brothers. I try to avoid her. However today they got on my last nerve. They were throwing things, yelling, and arguing all day. I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. Their parents were just sitting there on their phones not bothering to do anything. I eventually had enough and told the kids to stop fighting in the house, I took the remote because they were fighting over the tv, and I sent them outside to play because they destroyed the room and I was extremely overstimulated.

I turned my anger towards my cousin and his wife, and in short I told them that I think they‚Äôre bad parents, and that they need to grow up and be adults for once. My cousin‚Äôs wife started crying and yelling at me saying that I have no right to say that, my cousin jumped in to tell me i‚Äôm just a child and I need to treat them with respect. I screamed back saying I‚Äôm not going to treat them like adults until they get their shit together, and I stormed off to my room. Now my mom is telling me to apologize because it wasn‚Äôt nice, but I don‚Äôt think they deserve an apology. They‚Äôve been here 7 months, and only one of them has gotten a job. They only have $400 dollars saved up to find a place to live, when they were supposed to at least have a few thousand dollars because they aren‚Äôt paying bills and their rent is very cheap. They also receive $600 on food stamps each month. I don‚Äôt think what I said was wrong.

57,1e6i5an,AITA For Snitching on my Employee?,"So I work in before and after school care. I'm the assistant supervisor at my site and besides me and the supervisor, there's only one other employee at our site. Our boss is a very strict woman. We have a daily lesson plan and she adheres to it minute for minute. She actually has gained a reputation in the district for her strictness, to the point very few want to work with her.

The employee, Rod, showed up a couple minutes late for work one day. We have a period of roughly 15 minutes every day before the students to set up the cafeteria for the day. The supervisor, Sheri, let him off with a warning. A few days later, Sheri had to be out or town for a family related issue. In her absence I am acting supervisor. She was absent one afternoon shift and the following morning shift. Rod showed up late again the morning she was gone.

We still had time to set up and then some, and he sheepishly asked if I could not mention his lateness to Sheri. I assured him he was safe and that it would stay between us but not to show up late again. He thanked me and I confided in him that I thought Sheri was too strict and that our children almost seemed scared of her. The previous afternoon, I had allowed the designated snack time to run 5 minutes longer, and overheard a kid saying ""finally, I had enough time to finish my snack!"" I was saddened by this, and told Rod as much. He agreed with everything I said, saying that under my leadership things were generally less stressful. I agreed with him and we carried on with our day.

After we closed for the morning, I started feel bad about lying to Sheri. When she got back, I told her and she set up a meeting with the 3 of us. She asked Rod to come into our makeshift office and he was clearly blindsided by what followed. He sat across the table from us while Sheri grilled him not just for his tardiness but for asking me to omit it. I sat in silence. He was mostly straight faced but I could see anger in his eyes. He received a write up and surprisingly didn't say anything about or to me.

This morning, Sheri was gone again, sick this time, so it was just me and Rod. I greeted him, and he responded with a quick and flat hello.

So I (21f) have a friend (20f) who we will call AJ
who's mother is in the hospital with a very severe and potentially fatal illness (I won't say what illness for privacy reasons and because it doesn't really matter for the story) she has been worried sick about her and is constantly stressed and anxious and it has very obviously taking a toll on her mental health so me and one other friend decided to try to get her mind of things by just having a her day where we just do whatever she wanted, we spoke with her before planning this to make sure it's something that she would want as well and she agreed only on the condition that nothing about her mother would be mentioned at all, because if it's brought up then there is no way she would be able to stop thinking about it and thus the point of the day would be useless.

We went shopping and then in the evening went to my house to have a film marathon (she didn't want to do it at her house and our other friends parents wouldn't allow it)  I knew in advance that my mother was also gonna be home that day and she knows about AJ's moms illness because of Facebook, so I explicitly told her that today was to get AJ's mind of it and help her relax and that she was thus not allowed to bring up her mother at all.
She said she understood and just to be sure I told her the morning of the day once again that she was not allowed to bring up AJ's mom.

So my friend and I took AJ shopping and although it was hard at the start it seemed that throughout the day she got less anxious and more relaxed and happy.
That was until we got to my place to watch a movie and we are barely through the door before my mother comes in and says. ""AJ, I saw about your mom on Facebook, how is she?"" AJ got visibly upset and said with audible strain in her voice that she didn't wanna talk about it. My mother kept pushing while trying to console her which only made her more upset so I told my mother I needed to have a word with her in the other room.

I won't lie I was very mean and disrespectful to her, I don't remember exactly what I said since most of it was said out of rage but it included stuff about her not knowing boundaries and that she was becoming like her mother (my mom went really low contact with her mother  because she was constantly crossing boundaries, gossiping about private matters and had a hand for gaslighting).

After I came out of the room AJ was still upset and wanted to go home so our other friend took her home. I later apologized to my mom for comparing her to her mom but that I still stood by what I said about boundaries. She has been giving me the silent treatment ever since.

That was until we got to my place to watch a movie and we are barely through the door before my mother comes in and says. ""AJ, I saw about your mom on Facebook, how is she?"" AJ got visibly upset and said with audible strain in her voice that she didn't wanna talk about it. My mother kept pushing while trying to console her which only made her more upset so I told my mother I needed to have a word with her in the other room.

I won't lie I was very mean and disrespectful to her, I don't remember exactly what I said since most of it was said out of rage but it included stuff about her not knowing boundaries and that she was becoming like her mother (my mom went really low contact with her mother  because she was constantly crossing boundaries, gossiping about private matters and had a hand for gaslighting).

After I came out of the room AJ was still upset and wanted to go home so our other friend took her home. I later apologized to my mom for comparing her to her mom but that I still stood by what I said about boundaries. She has been giving me the silent treatment ever since.

She called me around the same time again the next night, saying she was up late vacuuming. I texted her the next morning, saying it was rude calling me so late, especially since she knew what my schedule was. In an attempt to show that I wasn't upset at all about it, I made what I thought was a clear joke asking why exactly she was up so late and if vacuuming was a euphemism for something. She got upset. She went off on me, saying I was rude for calling her rude, her ex-husband accused her of cheating all the time, we're not together, we've only been talking for a couple of days so I don't have the right to ask, her ex-husband was controlling, and she works late most nights.

I said I wasn't upset, and I understand taking offense to being called rude but I wasn't calling HER rude, the act of calling late was rude, adding the mention of the vacuuming was a joke that I thought was clearly obvious exactly because we only reconnected 2 days ago. I apologized, knowing how making a joke like that could be triggering. Also, her schedule was never communicated to me, and in the future I'll be open to her calling late, and that she can call me at any point during the day.

One night a week later, she said she might be done super late, and she left it ambiguous as to whether she would call when she was done.

The 4 of us decided to go to a waterpark that's about 70 km from where we live, the only issue being that we have to cross the border into a different city.  When we got to the waterpark, I told everyone that we should try staying close to eachother because the waterpark was genuinely huge and I wouldn't be carrying my phone with me everywhere. After getting into the pool for about half an hour, we decided to set up our chairs and towels, and while I went to get my towel, Susan and sarah said they'll go out for a quick smoke ( The waterpark had both an interior and exterior section).

I told them that it's not fair for them to basically prevent us from having a fun time aswell because they forgot about us.

When we got to the waterpark, I told everyone that we should try staying close to eachother because the waterpark was genuinely huge and I wouldn't be carrying my phone with me everywhere.

69,1e6gwvu,AITA for not singing the happy birthday song to my gf because I was too tired?,"It was my gf‚Äôs birthday recently, and we were on a call just before midnight, waiting to celebrate. I wanted to be the first to say ""happy birthday,"" and she wanted me to be that person too. We stayed up late, enjoying each other's company, and I had the happy birthday song playing in the background. I probably told her ""happy birthday"" dozens of times, and we shared a heartfelt moment.
As the night went on, we played video games for a couple of hours, and she asked for help deciding which laptop to buy for her birthday. It took about 3 hours to finalize the decision while she played games and we chatted. It was great and we were vibing.

She wasn't planning to do anything for her birthday due to a lack of money, and I had spent four days with her the previous week. She forgot she took a week off for her birthday, or I would have saved the little money I had. We're long-distance, currently three hours apart btw. 

Impulsively, I decided to buy a ticket to see her that night, even though it meant staying up late, not packing, and spending money I didn't have. I walked, took a train, two buses, and an Uber to see her. I felt terrible because I hadn't eaten or slept. She knew I wouldn't be able to sleep, and I told her that before ending our last call.
When I arrived, I spent some time with her and apologized for being exhausted. I needed sleep, so we cuddled in her bed. She wanted to have sex, and although she said we didn't have to because I was too tired, I wanted to make her feel good on her birthday. We had sex twice, but I was beyond tired and pushed myself a lot.

Afterward, she asked if her roommate and I could sing happy birthdays. I agreed, but wasn't too enthusiastic admittedly. I fell asleep quickly, still naked. She woke me up after 10‚Äì20 minutes, wanting us to sing happy birthday. I was too tired to make sense of it, and I fell back asleep after saying I was too tired.

When I woke up, she was upset. Despite buying her a gift and money being tight, she told me I couldn't do the ‚Äúbare minimum‚Äù by singing a ""one-minute song"" for her. I told her I intended to sing it but was too tired. I even offered to sing it when I woke up, but she ignored me, staring at her video games. She thinks I just didn‚Äôt care to do it for her. But that‚Äôs further from the truth. I actually even practiced for a tiny bit because I know how she is. I expected her to ask because she‚Äôs all about creating intimate and lovey-dovey moments. I know that sounds unbelievable but it‚Äôs true. Anyways, it‚Äôs the next day. I rescheduled my ticket for the next day because she honestly didn‚Äôt want anything to do with me anymore. I tried everything to make it up to her. But she didn‚Äôt care.

70,1e6gvbm,AITA for getting into an argument with my husband because he left me during surgery.,"
 I am a (25f) and my husband (27) and I have been together for almost 4 years and we do not have any kids. I had a same-day lumpectomy surgery yesterday. The tumor is not believed to be malignant, but I wanted it out since my mother had breast cancer. My husband got the day off work and drove me. The surgery was delayed for about 3 hours, and my husband was getting impatient. The surgeon finally came in and said she expected the surgery would take an hour. After she left, my husband said he was going to leave the hospital to get lunch when I went under since he hadn‚Äôt eaten that day. I wanted him to be able to eat and was trying to be brave, but I really didn‚Äôt want to be left when the surgery was only supposed to be an hour, so I asked him if we could pick up food for him on the way home. He gave me the impression he would stay, and I was wheeled away. 

Fast forward to 30 minutes later, I was being shaken awake by a nurse who told me I was sick and she was trying to get in touch with my husband. Apparently, during the surgery, my blood pressure dropped rapidly, and my surgeon was able to get the tumor out in 20 minutes. My BP was 70/30 by the time they got it out, and my lips had turned blue.

I was very sick in my room. I was bleeding through my internal stitches, coming in and out of consciousness, and was vomiting‚Äî all the while; my nurse was trying to track my husband down. My surgeon called him, but he did not answer. I‚Äôm very thankful for the sweet nurses who took care of me and reassured me. It is the next day now, and I‚Äôm very emotional and angry about the whole ordeal. 

My husband did not apologize and has been incredibly defensive about the whole thing. His explanation for leaving was, ‚ÄúI went out and got lunch, and then I was getting gas because I was low from driving your ass around. The surgery was suppose to be an hour. How was I supposed to know your heart could have stopped?‚Äù
I told him he had one job which was to stay with me and tell me what the surgeon says. 
I could get over him leaving if he was apologetic or remorseful, but I‚Äôm shocked at his words/how little he seems to care for someone he claims to love. 

In his defense, he cared for me last night when we got home but left today after we argued. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm just still really emotional from anesthesia and being a bit dramatic, but I can‚Äôt even look at him the same. He is usually attentive and caring, so I am baffled. I‚Äôm sure he thought the chances of anything going wrong were slim, but I can‚Äôt understand his thought process.

I sat for hours and hours in waiting rooms during all of my mother‚Äôs breast cancer procedures and was nervous to even leave for a minute to get food.

We had an argument on Tuesday about the bills. Just to fill you in we had a baby in January so he bought the house. I was happy that our baby will have own bedroom and a lot of family around (he have 3 sisters). 
My friends were telling me that my name should be on the house in case something happens. He is a cop. He never introduced me to his finances and anytime I would ask him anything about it he would brush me off with some simple respond. Any time I ask to put my name on the house he would say ‚Äúthen give me half of the deposit‚Äù. 
Ever since the baby is here he would point to me that I spend to much, yet I overheard his conversation with his buddy that he‚Äôs planning to install a special outlet for his Tesla that will cost 10,000.00. I drive me and our baby in Honda civic that have clear tape on the front windshield. 
My money runs out with renovation of the bathroom and fixing the floors. When we were at his parents house he came to me angry about my spending( mostly gas and groceries). 
I got frustrated and point to him that he have 2 family cars that he doesn‚Äôt let me use at all so he don‚Äôt care about us.
 He showed to me couple of times that his mom and sisters are more important to him then me and the baby. He got so angry and started to scream go and tell them that! I went to the living room and said that me and the baby are going home. He followed me screaming the same thing. I asked him to drive me and baby home but he refused and added‚Äù ask one of your friends to take you home!‚Äù. I got angry and tried to think it through what to do. His sister was visiting from Florida so I was sure she want to hang out with our baby for a little longer. 
I took my begs and left their house to avoid screaming and arguing in front of his family. I got Lyft and went home. On the way home I got even more frustrated because it felt like he chooses his family over us again, so I texted him to bring the baby home. 
He came with one of the sisters and tried to talk to me. I got fed up with him and said we will split. His sister right away, threaten me with attorney and kicking me out of the house, but I didn‚Äôt care for what she had to say. Next morning I received the phone call that his father passed away. In my culture, we don‚Äôt keep the babies around the funeral arrangements or death in general so I went to pick up the baby. When I got to his parents house no one was opening the door. Instead, garage door start opening, and I saw his sister driving through the grass to run away from me. She backed up and run over to grass again this time coming straightforward at me when she was closer, she press gas to scare me off.
 I called him asking why his sister was trying to run me over?! he said that I am not welcome in a hospital so do not come otherwise security is gonna take me out. I just wanted to pick up the baby and go home and talk to him afterwards but he said that the baby is safe and I should go home. 
I went to the police and they said that they can‚Äôt do anything about it. They told me to go home and wait for them to come back. The same evening, I came back to their house to pick up the baby, but nobody was opening the door.

When the police came to the house to make a report, they came with the surgeon who said that they know where the baby is.

73,1e6g8iq,AITA for sulking bc my mum forgot to make dinner reservation?,"I'm 18,F ; I lost my dad when I was 10, mum was re-married again 3 yrs after dad passed away. 

A little backstory before y'all saying ITA since parents always win this contest üôÑ

I'm the youngest among 3 siblings. Both my brothers are adult adult (they're 28 & 30 yo). Honestly I feel like I'm either an accident, or my parents just wanted to have a daughter. LOL

Anyway here's all bit more info: Mum is a v attentive person to everything else that is not me üò§ For eg: if it was her group of friends, she'd be the PIC that comes up w the itinerary, reservations, bookings, etc.

She's rarely home. She's always busy, all the traveling, work, traveling, friends, new husband ü§∑ (my step-dad owns a small business at a neighbouring country which he has a PR for so we have been traveling back and forth to spend time tgt too). 

Mum has a group of ""besties"" that she hangs out with. They workout tgt, go for yoga tgt, travel tgt yada yada, you know the gist. 

I mean, don't get me wrong. That is not the problem, she's j living life and I'm fine w that bc I love that she's happy but I expect her to be present when she's around. 

I honestly feel like I grew up w our helpers more than her. She's rarely around, but she treats me like I'm a kid still even until now! She tracks me around (w FindmyIphone), CCTV at home, GPS in the car ü•≤ 

Anyway, long story short. I haven't seen her in 2 weeks. It's pretty normal, she travels often, but we've made a plan to go on a girls-date once she's back. She told me to get all ready for omakase and I was super excited about it!

She got back and told me that she has forgotten to make a reservation üò§üòí‚òπÔ∏è So now we're j having dinner at a normal  Japanese restaurant. But that's not the issue. The fact that she has forgotten!

I got all excited bc she had tell me in advance and it did not happen. And the fact that she FORGOT. She never forget to make reservations for her friends. I feel like I'm just there. 

She does things like this and make amends by getting me gifts but it still doesn't make it okay for her to treat it like it's okay to not be present when we spend time together. There are j so many other things but yeah it feels good to type them out

Second edit: Idk about moving out. I enjoy staying in this home w help around, probably will stay here for longer. I'm in Asia, so it's normal in our culture to stay at my parents house even as an adult. Also I'm not that motivated to move out.

Edit no 4: Ty to all",Asshole,2024-07-18,"AITA for sulking bc my mum forgot to make dinner reservation? I'm 18,F ; I lost my dad when I was 10, mum was re-married again 3 yrs after dad passed away. 

A little backstory before y'all saying ITA since parents always win this contest üôÑ

I'm the youngest among 3 siblings. Both my brothers are adult adult (they're 28 & 30 yo). Honestly I feel like I'm either an accident, or my parents just wanted to have a daughter. LOL

Anyway here's all bit more info: Mum is a v attentive person to everything else that is not me üò§ For eg: if it was her group of friends, she'd be the PIC that comes up w the itinerary, reservations, bookings, etc.

She's rarely home. She's always busy, all the traveling, work, traveling, friends, new husband ü§∑ (my step-dad owns a small business at a neighbouring country which he has a PR for so we have been traveling back and forth to spend time tgt too). 

Mum has a group of ""besties"" that she hangs out with. They workout tgt, go for yoga tgt, travel tgt yada yada, you know the gist. 

I mean, don't get me wrong. That is not the problem, she's j living life and I'm fine w that bc I love that she's happy but I expect her to be present when she's around. 

I honestly feel like I grew up w our helpers more than her. She's rarely around, but she treats me like I'm a kid still even until now! She tracks me around (w FindmyIphone), CCTV at home, GPS in the car ü•≤ 

Anyway, long story short. I haven't seen her in 2 weeks. It's pretty normal, she travels often, but we've made a plan to go on a girls-date once she's back. She told me to get all ready for omakase and I was super excited about it!

She got back and told me that she has forgotten to make a reservation üò§üòí‚òπÔ∏è So now we're j having dinner at a normal  Japanese restaurant. But that's not the issue. The fact that she has forgotten!

The ignore is them not talking to my son AT ALL after the quick 2 minutes ""happy celebration"" they gave to him. They didn't made any eye contact with him, it makes him nervous to talk first, as they acted like he's not there.

If you ask, why didn't I start the conversation and instead go quiet? I was sad my son only got 2 minutes attention, a hand and back rub, that's it. I was too busy with my thought and I don't know...they seemed so happy, I just couldn't bring the topic about my son into them.

And it is not like I don't let them to be happy and celebrated what my nephew deserves. They already did 2 celebration before they came to visit. A celebration for achieving remission and celebration for the bell rang. The documentations are there on the family chat group, I congratulate them and I'm happy for them. When my nephew first diagnosed, my sister asked me a lot of questions (the Cancer type are different), and I'm very happy to answer and helping what I can. Was it too much if I expected that dinner to be my son's turn to get the attention, recognition and love?

Lastly, many of you assumed it is a jealousy, because my nephew is now in remission, but my son has not. It is one factor, but what I feel isn't really about the Cancer or jealousy of his remission. Rather, it is the sadness because my son wanted to build a relationship with my parents, my siblings and his cousins. They only met each other in person twice. They don't have the strongest bound, but my son love them dearly. It is a sadness because that desire is not achieved.

I understand we are far away. They are closer, and of course they are already comfortable with each other and know each other so well. But we just want to try. My son is just wants to try.

That's pathetic when I know that they don't have any effort to be closer to us, but I still hope they will shower my son with love, that he is actually deserves to get.

My son recently discharged from a long hospital stay (3,5 months), he was having emergency heart surgery due to ruptured aortic dissection (rare occurance in children, they were actually kind of shocked when they found out what's going on). The surgery was 15 hours long, because he was bleeding all night long, almost died (he have bleeding disorder, also extremely low platelet at the time). And the recovery was very tough, he got infection back to back, sepsis to septic shock and other problems, almost died again, put him on ECMO and ventilator, and stayed in the ICU, from post surgery day to 2 week before discharge.

In another hand, one of nephew recently kicked Cancer a$$. We are so proud and grateful. Even though it doesn't mean it's all over, but we are happy with this news. As info, my son is also battling Cancer. It's been 4 years, and he's not in remission yet, not a singke time. And we probably would never. He's still on the battle.

Last night, we were out for dinner, together. There was me, my son, my husband, all my family members. They just arrived a night before, from my home country. It is a holiday time for schoolers there. So that was our first dinner together. I brought up about my son just been discharge recently, after facing a ""big battle"". That was how I phrase it.

They were so happy and my son as well. He's still weak, in pain here and there, but he's overall stable, so he can be with us. Then, my sister suddenly said, ""And (my nephew) just beat Cancer!"" and clapping her hands. My family turn away from my son so fast, congratulate them.

I don't know. I'm happy for them, for my nephew. But I just...sad? I can see my son forced his smile seeing them. I just hurt. I probably a bad person. It is not really about the attention, I don't know how to explain. I hope any of you understand.

I was quiet through the dinner, majority of the time. I barely smile. My parents noticed and they seemed not liking my behavior (I know them too well). They were talking about my nephew's Cancer treatment in Singapore and their experience there. No one talk to my son.

After dinner was over, my mom confronted me through texts, saying how can I have that kind of attitude? Why am I mad about my nephew beat Cancer?

I told her, I wasn't. Apparently, I vomited my true feeling about the situation to her. She called me an AH and I just don't like seeing my family being happy. And that I should grateful, at least my son isn't die.

My sister blocked me. But my other siblings turned out be on my side.

81,1e6fbb6,AITA for this? Advice appreciated,"So for context; I became friends with a neighbor of mine last year because we both went to see Taylor Swift at the Eras tour on different days and we bonded over that and other artists we enjoy. We slowly started to hang out from time to time and it was nice at first but as the friendship kept growing, I noticed he started to become way too comfortable after I would let him borrow a couple of records when he started to get into collecting. At first I didn't mind but it started to bother me when I would get them back the sleeves had greasy finger prints on it and then ask to borrow more. It got to the point that now instead of asking, he just says ""I feel like listening to this one today"" as in I'll take this one please and thank you but without asking if it was okay or not. I just lied and said I'm holding off on lending my records out because the last one was damaged by someone else and I was annoyed about it. I feel bad because he probably doesn't have many friends in the town we live in but his comfort escalated quickly.

Advice appreciated So for context; I became friends with a neighbor of mine last year because we both went to see Taylor Swift at the Eras tour on different days and we bonded over that and other artists we enjoy. We slowly started to hang out from time to time and it was nice at first but as the friendship kept growing, I noticed he started to become way too comfortable after I would let him borrow a couple of records when he started to get into collecting. At first I didn't mind but it started to bother me when I would get them back the sleeves had greasy finger prints on it and then ask to borrow more. It got to the point that now instead of asking, he just says ""I feel like listening to this one today"" as in I'll take this one please and thank you but without asking if it was okay or not. I just lied and said I'm holding off on lending my records out because the last one was damaged by someone else and I was annoyed about it. I feel bad because he probably doesn't have many friends in the town we live in but his comfort escalated quickly.

At that point, I (32 yr old female) decided to continue to make hotel and flight arrangements for my mother and I. That consisted of 1st class seats round trip and a hotel suite, that I paid for. No, I did not ask my mother to pay for either part. It was something I decided to do for her.

Now fast forward to vacation time, my mother's husband decides 1 week before we leave that he wants to go, buys his plane ticket, which is economy back of plane bcz that's all that was left. I didn't find this out until we boarded the plane, I'm in my seat and he asks my mother to ask me to switch seats with him so he could sit with her.

It's my mother so I did and sat economy round trip.

83,1e6f0r6,AITA for making an appointment for lip filler ,"So hi, I F(17) turns 18 in 2 days. I've always been insecure about my lips, more specifically my top lip. I was bullied before braces but things got worse after I got them off. My top lip looks like it's shrunk and it doesn't look right. I've never been the most attractive girl but lately I've been taking care of myself more. 

I don't have friends in school but i talk to some people when I go to therapy 2x a week (I do group therapy and 1-1 therapy). Well I've been talking to a girl ""Ali"" and she knows quiet alot about my situation. 'Ali' knows how much I hate my top lip and recommended lip filler. She talked me through everything and said that it isn't that expensive if you go to a cosmetology school and let a student do it. 

I looked into it and I made an appointment for the day after my birthday. I told my parents and they didn't approve of it. I was told that it always starts with just the lips and I'll end up looking like a barbie doll before I'm 20. News got out to my family and I'm getting calls and texts saying that i should be happy with how I look and 'God' made me like this for a reason. 

I'm currently staying at my Bf's house and I don't want to go home because people are pressing me into canceling the appointment. My boyfriend said he doesn't like the idea of filler BUT he wants to see me happy.

85,1e6euk4,AITA for objecting to my parents housing my cousin long-term?,"My cousin (M, 19) has to move back to our city for school while his parents remain overseas (though somewhat close by).

We live in an apartment with 2 (parents, mine) rooms + 1 guest room so it was very natural my aunt requested that my cousin come stay with us (for a longer while) while they remain overseas for work. My aunt‚Äôs family has also uses the guest room whenever they come back to our city to visit.

I have been vocal the past year or so about not having my cousin stay with us long-term before the arrangement was set, knowing that it is additional work for my mom (60yo) to clean up after another person in the house even though she says she doesn‚Äôt mind it. It's also additional expenses but this isn't the concern as we get by ok and I work too.

My mom and I have had a lot of disagreements over how strongly I am reacting to our new long-term guest(?) while she feels obligated / wants to return the kindness from my aunt (another story). I pointed out that they have always came back to stay with us during their holidays over the past 10 years or so (long story short, for the first few years they came back, my mom did the laundry and cleaning of +4pax, while holding a full-time job. My aunt's family staying with us eventually became PTSD for me...).

Fast forward to now and my cousin finally moves in. My mom tells me reminds me to be nice (but I wasn‚Äôt planning on being mean in the first place and I haven't, I've just been a bit more indifferent) and to give him a chance since he needs to learn how to be independent.

There are the trivial things he still needs to learn like washing up after himself instead of leaving used cups or cutlery in the sink, cleaning up the kitchen after cooking. I‚Äôm particular about hygiene and cleanliness - I acknowledge that I'm not easy to live with and not everyone has the same standards.

As my mom repeats to let my cousin be independent, I find her washing his bed sheets, sometimes washing up after his dishes, etc. 

A few days back, my mom called me ""insecure"", that I'm ""feeling threatened"" and I shouldn't be. A few hours later, mom is cleaning my cousin‚Äôs room (albeit he‚Äôs out and didn‚Äôt know) ‚Äî of course, I called her out for wanting to teach him independence, while still coddling him. We didn't speak for a while again.

If it were for a few months, I wouldn't have reacted as strongly but he‚Äôs definitely staying for over a year as his parents have no intentions on moving back just yet.

86,1e6epjz,AITA Stranger danger,"AITA for kicking out my mom after 4 years of her living with me and she has nowhere to go?
Lemme tell you why...
So, my mother has lived with me for the last 4 years. While doing so, the agreement was, she left her abusive ex, I left mine, she watches my kids, I work and pay for everything. Over the years I have paid all bills, food, any expense you can think of. Also giving her $100 every paycheck which I know doesn't sound like much but that's all I can afford to give her. I also give her $1500 once a year on my tax return. During this time, we have moved across the country and I am now a homeowner. Bills are TIGHT. I work min 50 hours a week. This has never been rainbows and sunshine, she complains at any possible moment and claims I'm keeping her from living life because she has to watch my kids and she ""gets fucking fed up with them"".
Now that you have a general overview of our situation, let me explain why I'm kicking her out...
She texted me the other day saying her friend came over to ask for a ride and then left. Just letting me know before the kids say something and I get mad. She says this because i have CLEARLY explained i dont want strangers in my house. Ok fine, whatever. The next day I'm about to leave for work and she tells me to say hi to him. He came over while i was getting ready and was in her room. I've never heard of this man before. She met him online. I'm like I gtg! My mom said he would be leaving in an hour. I told my 9yo to text me and let me know when he leaves because I felt some type of way about him being there. I cried all the way to work thinking/overthinking about all the things that could happen. My son wasn't answering my texts so I called. This was about 2 hours later. The man was still there. I hang up and continue to try to text and call my son for hours. He won't answer. 
Finally my boyfriend makes it to my house to check on everything. Once he gets there, this man leaves to wait in my mom's car. My boyfriend says he has prison tattoos from head to toe (I'm covered in tattoos myself so don't come at me about judging him) and that his pants were sagging down his ass and he looked like a drug dealer/user. Which my mom has led me to believe she uses anyways.
I was so mad, this random man was in my house with my children for hours. Once I got home, my 9yo tells me this man was there all day the day before as well, so she lied to me about him just stopping by. And that she took his phone and told him he's not allowed to talk to me. This ""keep secrets from mom"" behavior disgusts me to no end. I told her if she can't respect my boundaries with my children and my house, she can leave. Her response is, fuck your house get off your high horse I can have friends bitch.
AITA for not wanting strange men around my kids when I'm not around?! I also dropped the bomb on her that I'm pregnant and don't want her involved with anything Once she leaves since my children are obviously not a priority to her and she can't respect my boundaries.

I ask how his day was etc but other than that we don‚Äôt really have much in common.

 I haven‚Äôt been very talkative I‚Äôve just found out my dad has sarcoma cancer it extremely rare 1 out of a 100 people get it and there isn‚Äôt any treatment available in Australia bc of how rare it is. I rarely talk about it much bc I‚Äôm finding it hard to except that it going on, basically my dad has cancer in his stomach and the only resolution is if they cut it out he losses a leg and he isn‚Äôt willing to do that for personal reasons. The average life expectancy doctor have given us a time rage of 5 year left we have another option to go to Japan bc there is treatment there but we can‚Äôt afford that. 

My bf dad is mad bc he didn‚Äôt hear me say hi yesterday because I said it so quiet he then says in Italian well looking at me dead in the face ‚Äúshe can‚Äôt even say hi when coming into my home‚Äù. I understood bc my mum is Spanish and Italian isn‚Äôt that different.

 this morning my bf tells me I can‚Äôt go over next week I ask why and my bf explains how his dad thinks I‚Äôm rude bc I didn‚Äôt say hi ( first time I‚Äôve done something he doesn‚Äôt like and I just said it quite). my bf then explain how he hasn‚Äôt met my mum or dad which I don‚Äôt think is fair nor do I think he‚Äôs having any sort empathy or care about what going on with my family.
my mum has not been in the mood to meet his parents. she been running around for doctors and hospitals for months, and she works a 6 hour job 5 days a week. finding outside someone u married may be dying is very hard news to find out much more hard then it is for me, and I don‚Äôt blame her at all for not being in the right head space to meet his parents. He dad then brought why my mum didn‚Äôt meet them the first time I met them and basically saying he really annoyed he hasn‚Äôt met her which I personally think isn‚Äôt fair bc he knows what going on he know why and top of that I see my bf on Wednesday my dad goes to a cancer centre every Wednesday with my mum. my brother pick me up and drops me off

 this morning my bf tells me I can‚Äôt go over next week I ask why and my bf explains how his dad thinks I‚Äôm rude bc I didn‚Äôt say hi ( first time I‚Äôve done something he doesn‚Äôt like and I just said it quite). my bf then explain how he hasn‚Äôt met my mum or dad which I don‚Äôt think is fair nor do I think he‚Äôs having any sort empathy or care about what going on with my family.
my mum has not been in the mood to meet his parents. she been running around for doctors and hospitals for months, and she works a 6 hour job 5 days a week. finding outside someone u married may be dying is very hard news to find out much more hard then it is for me, and I don‚Äôt blame her at all for not being in the right head space to meet his parents. He dad then brought why my mum didn‚Äôt meet them the first time I met them and basically saying he really annoyed he hasn‚Äôt met her which I personally think isn‚Äôt fair bc he knows what going on he know why and top of that I see my bf on Wednesday my dad goes to a cancer centre every Wednesday with my mum. my brother pick me up and drops me off

We have 2 campgrounds booked we're going to split time in and multiple POIs, some of which required tickets purchased ahead of time.

My Aunt(61f) recently was admitted to the hospital, about an hour away from us.  She fell down her deck stairs and damaged a couple vertebrae and I believe the plates between the vertebrae. (Not a doctor, in case that wasn't clear. Lol)

She's completely stable, but in a lot of pain and discomfort.  She also has a history with pain killers so that plays into the level of strength pain med doctors can administer.

Anyway, my cousins found out we are still going and are furious with us, and I guess want us to stay and idk be available for her?  Honestly not sure.  I called her and also sent a few check in texts but what would you like me to do if I cancel our trip? Sit by your hospital bed while you writhe in pain?  Nothing about this is life threatening but it is no doubt painful, moreso for her, so it feels like my cousins are just mad at the world and taking it out on us(me specifically).

90,1e6dimv,AITA for telling my sister she has no friends because of her attitude?,"I (17M) and my sister (14F) havent had a very good relationship in a while. When i was a kid, I was pretty mean to her. Our parents are both pretty toxic- we have a narcissistic mother and an emotionally unavailable and unstable father. Our mom is a recovering alcoholic, and we're both pretty messed up about our childhood. I've been in therapy for years, working on my trauma and harmful behavior, and have a tenative diagnosis of a couple different disorders. Point is, I've been working on it. 

For the past couple years, though, she's been really awful. She takes everything as a personal attack- even just asking her to clean up her dishes will be met with an extremely aggresive response. She's verbally aggresive towards our whole family: threatens us, calls us names, among other things.

I take the worst of it, usually. Just the other day she started screaming at me and calling me annoying and worthless for ""breathing too loud"". My parents keep telling me to just ignore her, but if I ignore her, I get the same response.

She treats her friends like garbage, and then is devastated when they drop her, saying she did nothing wrong. 

Here's where I think i may be TA though. 
Middle school is really really difficult. I was a mess in middle school, and I took it out on people I cared about. 
We got into a fight the other day- a really bad one. She was saying really horrible things to me that I won't repeat, but even my older sibling was shocked at the sheer cruelty of the things she was saying. 
I told her, ""this is why you have no friends. because you treat everyone like garbage."" 

My parents said it was wrong of me to say that, because she's very sensitive about being lonely. I feel really bad. 

AITA? 

Edit: Thank you for all the responses! 
Yes, she is in therapy. No, it's not working, as it's online and she refuses to hear anything other than agreement with her actions. Yes, I have apologized for my being really mean to her when I was young (back when I was like 7-10). 

I have apologized to her for pointing out her insecurity, but I also said that I don't feel safe or respected when she gets so upset, which caused another argument. I didn't say anything, I just left the house and drove off.

Anyway, my best friend has been in a very toxic controlling relationship for 3+ years already. She constantly tells me about their ups and downs, saying she will leave him and of course never does. I support this because even though I don‚Äôt know super specific details of their relationship, he has showed a lot of insecurity and jealously within their relationship. For example, he doesn‚Äôt want her to wear certain types of clothing, he wants to be included even if it‚Äôs a ‚Äúgirls only‚Äù outing, he checks her phone all the time, etc.

This most recent time that he checked her phone, he went through our messages. He scrolled so far back that he saw messages from weeks ago, that were her talking about leaving him. So a ton of things that I had said to her in between were obviously read. This isn‚Äôt the first time he has read our private messages either. I might as well make a group chat with him in it if he wants to read every single damn thing. This has left me very upset and it doesn‚Äôt seem like she‚Äôs worried about him invading our privacy, more so worried about the fact that that he‚Äôs upset she said he would leave him one day! Which also rubs me the wrong way.

so am I the asshole if I tell her she needs to set boundaries with him otherwise I won‚Äôt be messaging her anymore?

For the first 9 years of our marriage I would drive back and forth between the two states several times a day (we still own the home now) but I did it because I love my husband more than life. 
When we began staying with my dad last year the only bill he asked us to pay was the electric because he knew we were still having to pay for everything else with the other house. We have two good paying jobs so we have never really struggled financially (in spite of my husband being a penny pincher and thinking we live paycheck to paycheck which we don‚Äôt). Anywho this past month we got an electric bill for $500.  My husband is a bigger guy and is always hot. Meanwhile my dad, myself and my kids are usually cold. The only time the kids are not cold is when they are sitting next to him and his body heat makes them warm. Otherwise it might as well be snowing in here.

96,1e6b83l,AITA I told my roommate that she doesn't clean as much around the house and she's mad,"I (32) live with my best friend and roommate (37). We've lived together over a year and function as a married couple since we've both had disaster relationships in the past and found we're happier living with each other. Since we moved into this home, I've taken on most of the cleaning responsibilities since my roommate wouldn't do much when it came to cleaning. She does do all the laundry (I fold it) and put it away and will offer to vacuum, clean bathrooms, do dishes sometimes or will do something if I ask her. The heavier lift items, cleaning the kitchen (surfaces, cabinets, stovetop, oven, microwave, pantry, fridge), bathrooms (shower), dusting, mopping, vacuuming the couch, etc. are all done by me on a two week rotation. I've told her in the past that I feel a bit like a maid and some help would make me better. I don't expect her to take all the responsibility.

Recently, I had a depressive episode, so the majority of cleaning hasn't been done for 3 weeks. This past Sunday, she vacuumed the first floor (3 story home) and cleaned the first floor bathroom in addition to her regular laundry duties. She was asking when I'd like to get a cat, since I agreed to getting a pet. I mentioned that with a cat, that additional cleaning would need to happen since cats shed and track litter. I said that I do the majority of the cleaning, and also, we rent so that would increase as well, so maybe right now isn't the time. She got extremely mad that I mentioned that she only vacuumed the first floor and the bathroom and that I have the majority responsibility. She did not want to talk to me about it and shut me out. This happened later in the evening, and it's past 12AM now and she's still on a rampage cleaning the upstairs bathroom, which I did not ask for.

She won't speak to me and is not giving me the chance to discuss why it's important to me to have this conversation. I'm in therapy and we are working on sharing my emotions and thoughts honestly with people I trust. This situation was one of those opportunities to do that with someone I trust and it blew up in my face in the worst way.

So AITA for telling my roommate that she does less cleaning around the house than me?",TL;DR,2024-07-18,"AITA I told my roommate that she doesn't clean as much around the house and she's mad I (32) live with my best friend and roommate (37). We've lived together over a year and function as a married couple since we've both had disaster relationships in the past and found we're happier living with each other. Since we moved into this home, I've taken on most of the cleaning responsibilities since my roommate wouldn't do much when it came to cleaning. She does do all the laundry (I fold it) and put it away and will offer to vacuum, clean bathrooms, do dishes sometimes or will do something if I ask her. The heavier lift items, cleaning the kitchen (surfaces, cabinets, stovetop, oven, microwave, pantry, fridge), bathrooms (shower), dusting, mopping, vacuuming the couch, etc. are all done by me on a two week rotation. I've told her in the past that I feel a bit like a maid and some help would make me better. I don't expect her to take all the responsibility.

Recently, I had a depressive episode, so the majority of cleaning hasn't been done for 3 weeks. This past Sunday, she vacuumed the first floor (3 story home) and cleaned the first floor bathroom in addition to her regular laundry duties. She was asking when I'd like to get a cat, since I agreed to getting a pet. I mentioned that with a cat, that additional cleaning would need to happen since cats shed and track litter.

So I (24m) am currently on a family vacation that we‚Äôve been taking since I was 1 years old (minus one year for my sibling being born near the trip date). I am kind of the black sheep of the family as I  am usually on the quieter side and am possibly autistic (undergoing testing with my therapist and my family of course doesn‚Äôt believe in all that). I usually stay to myself as I dont like to talk or socialize very much and my social battery drains very quickly. My family is very extroverted and loves to be around each other as often as possible. There are 22 of us in total with people from 75 to 8 years old split up into 4 cabins arranged by family. I don‚Äôt have a family member close to my age besides my cousin and she is nice enough but her and my sibling get along a lot better and have a lot more common interests. But don‚Äôt get it twisted dear reader I love my family, I am just quieter and prefer to be on my phone scrolling either this sub or another after a long day. I hang out with them doing activities during the day like visiting the nearby town or going out to eat, but usually when it gets later in the day around 6-7 maybe 8 if i‚Äôm lucky, I get tired and want to lay down inside the cabin we have and relax for a bit after. My parents on the other hand are go go go and are disappointed that I dont regularly hang out with my family after and during the day. I just feel awkward and in the way. There are many reasons for this but the main factor being that I am the only male on this side and the other side of my family, making it incredibly awkward to try to relate to my sibling and other cousins who bond great and stay in one cabin together across from us. When I talk, it is usually met with silence and I have to ask again what they said and try to be a part of the conversation (even when I‚Äôm not on my phone). I just feel so awkward and in everybody‚Äôs way and I like to sit in the cabin and recuperate after trying to be social.

O was already angry at how I was invited to the wedding. You see, I'm pretty close to my brother and rather than telling me in person, he just send me an invitation card. That hurt, because I thought he didn't think I was that important to notify me about the wedding in person. 


So we arrived a week before the wedding to help with a few things. Up to this point I haven't even met the bride, but when I did, I realised it was an old friend of mine that used to watch after me when my parents or brother didn't have time. Obviously I was excited to meet her after finding out, yet she seemed cold and distant. I thought she might have just been tired from all the planning, but I noticed quickly that her cold demeanor was just for me.


 Let's call her Chloe. She was all happy and polite with others. This has been going on for three days and I just couldn't hold it in anymore. It's an understatement how downright rude she was with me. She'd often make snarky remarks towards me. For example ""You want to wear that for the wedding?"". I've talked with my friends about it but they told me to stop overthinking it and that she's just stressed out from all the planning. I find that hard to believe, because why is she only rude to me? I have also noticed her saying some comments towards bridesmaids but it seems that it doesn't bother them that much. 


Basically the bride, my brother and family were all eating together, when Chloe decided to comment something. She was telling one of the bridesmaids that she shouldn't eat so much. I've had it, no amount of stress can excuse this type of behaviour. I told her to shut up and to stop being so rude to her guests. I started saying some nasty comments, that I regret now, but at that moment it seemed right. I can see tears forming in her eyes before she bursts out crying. Immediately my brother and everyone else started to comfort Chloe. My mother berated me, telling me I should be ashamed of myself for acting this way. My brother then said, I shouldn't even bother showing up to the wedding. That hurt. I thought we were close. I didn't think I would lose my brother to such a witch. Didn't I mean anything to him.

99,1e6a5wx,AITA for going to the police immediately when I found out my parents took out debt in my name. ,"My parents took out credit cards and loans in my name. It was fine when they were paying the bills but they got behind. 

I don't have a key to the mailbox so I never saw the bills or anything. I just finished my third year of university and I was going to move out. That would require me to get a credit check and stuff. 

My parents freaked out and forbid me from moving out. They said it was stupid that I would waste money on moving out when I could save money living at home. 

They don't like my boyfriend so I thought that was their issue. But not was I wrong. 

Long story short I am about $60,000 in debt because of them. I cannot afford to pay that off. 

I told them that they needed to clear the debt immediately and change the house rules so my boyfriend could spend the night. 

They said that they didn't have the money to pay the debt and that I could not strong arm them into changing the rules of their house. 

I called my auntie and asked her if I could please come stay with her for a bit. She let me and asked a lot of questions. Then she showed me a dozen Reddit posts about parents screwing up their kids future and kids allowing it. 

I went to the police and reported it. 

My parents got arrested and charged. They are furious with me.

Usually, with smoking, he‚Äôs been careful to warn us, is always outside when he smokes, and makes sure no one else is close when he does it (though he has gotten noticeably less cautious about it in recent years). But with vaping, he doesn‚Äôt care who is around.
For years now, I have expressed that I do not like when he vapes and the vape cloud goes in my face. He says it‚Äôs harmless, not the same as second hand smoke, but I do not care. I don‚Äôt like it, and he keeps doing it. This is specifically when we are in the car. 
I‚Äôve asked him to roll down the window if he is going to vape in the car, because I‚Äôm not trying to be unreasonable, and usually he does and rolls his eyes at me. 
However, yesterday even with the window rolled down, he blew it into the car instead of out the window, and I got another face full of vape cloud. This has happened NUMEROUS times. And no, he didn‚Äôt try to blow it out the window, he was facing my mom in the passenger seat so he wasn‚Äôt even looking at the window when he blew out the vape cloud.

Now, I‚Äôve gotten fed up, and am debating refusing to go anywhere with my dad (outside of life or death emergency) in the car if he doesn‚Äôt stop vaping while I‚Äôm in the car.

I‚Äôm 18 and I have my own car, and am only living with my parents until August, when I go to college, if that provides any useful information, I don‚Äôt know.

The reason I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôm the AH is because I know it‚Äôs an addiction. Would it be cruel to ask him not to vape for however long we‚Äôre in the car for?

102,1e69ev0,AITA for giving back a gift from my parents during family therapy?,"A year ago I (16f) learned that my parents had been lying to me, and my ""dad"" was not my bio dad. For me it wasn't the lie alone that caused problems. But the reason for the lie and the overall actions. My real dad didn't abandon me. He didn't walk out. He wasn't some asshole or deadbeat. He was in an accident when I was 5 months old that left him permanently disabled and unable to do anything for himself. My mom filed for divorce a month after the accident because she realized he wouldn't recover, she met my stepdad (and I call him that now) during that period, and before I was 2 they had him adopt me. My real dad's family wanted to be in my life but my parents refused and told them my stepdad was going to be known as my real dad and they didn't want to share me with them, my stepdad didn't want to share the title of dad, didn't want me to know I wasn't his blood. So they lied to me and hid it from me. They returned and/or destroyed any attempts my dad's family made to reach out. And because my dad was alive technically, just not able to make choices for himself, they couldn't get any grandparents rights to see me.

I found out the truth when a cousin from my dad's side reached out to me on social media last year. She sent me photos of me as a baby with my dad, sent me photos of me with that side of the family. She explained some of what happened and told me they had always wanted to know me and she'd always been aware I existed (she was like 16/17 when she found me). I searched our basement records one night (where all the paperwork is kept) and I found the birth certificate with my stepdad's name on it, but I also found the letter they got with it stating the changes had been made to father. I confronted my parents and I was angry they refused to acknowledge it, they tried to pawn me off and told me it was a lie and I shouldn't trust randos on the internet. It was only when I started calling my stepdad by his name instead of dad and saying he was my stepdad that they decided we needed therapy. It took 3 months for them to tell the truth. It took more months for them to admit why they had done it. They didn't like when I told them they did it for them and not me. My parents said they did it out of love for me. I said they did it to be selfish, to claim me as theirs and not have to share me.

I can't forgive them for it and they still keep me from my biological family. So during our last session in therapy I took off the necklace they gave me for my 13th birthday, they called it my daughter necklace, and I gave it back to them and told them I reject it. It went a little crazy after that and I stopped listening and they fought with the therapist. They told me I was being cruel with my actions and it wasn't right.

I searched our basement records one night (where all the paperwork is kept) and I found the birth certificate with my stepdad's name on it, but I also found the letter they got with it stating the changes had been made to father. I confronted my parents and I was angry they refused to acknowledge it, they tried to pawn me off and told me it was a lie and I shouldn't trust randos on the internet. It was only when I started calling my stepdad by his name instead of dad and saying he was my stepdad that they decided we needed therapy. It took 3 months for them to tell the truth. It took more months for them to admit why they had done it. They didn't like when I told them they did it for them and not me. My parents said they did it out of love for me. I said they did it to be selfish, to claim me as theirs and not have to share me.

I can't forgive them for it and they still keep me from my biological family. So during our last session in therapy I took off the necklace they gave me for my 13th birthday, they called it my daughter necklace, and I gave it back to them and told them I reject it. It went a little crazy after that and I stopped listening and they fought with the therapist. They told me I was being cruel with my actions and it wasn't right.

103,1e698ni,AITA for calling my mom's reason for not getting a cat insane and weird? ,"Hi guys. I (20f) have been wanting a cat for a while, because we've never had pets but all of my friends have one and I've recently been really wanting to get a kitten for the household. I live with my parents still and decided to bring it up to my mom, who I know doesn't want pets, but I just wanted to discuss it and see if I could maybe convince her. 

Right off the bat she cut me off, saying no. I asked her what would be the main reasons she doesn't want us to get a cat, expecting her to say costs, smell etc which is a fair reason, I just wanted to understand. But what she said absolutely shocked me. 

She said that I've been single too long (Mind you, I'm 20!! And my last boyfriend was back when I was 17.) and getting a cat would 'fulfill all of my biological and sexual needs for a partner' because I would have something to cuddle and love. And the reason she refuses to get it is because she wants me to 'feel emotionally and physically starved for affection until my instincts to start looking for a partner kicked in'. I stared at her with my jaw absolutely dropped and said that she's talking like a madwoman and I'd never love a cat as anything more than a pet, and that's a really freaky and weird, borderline zoophilic thing to think. 

She blew up on me, saying I'm totally out of line and that the reason I want a cat in the first place is 'my suppressed instincts to find love speaking'. Now she won't talk to me at all except sarcastically asking me every day 'if I got a boyfriend yet' so that she can get a cat. I've tried to talk to her about it, but she's just told me I'm being insane. 

EDIT: Just to make it clear, I had never asked her this question before in my whole life. I never nagged her or pestered her for a pet, and I just sat her down and asked her genuinely for the first time what her stance was on maybe getting a cat. She herself has been dealing with a lot mentally and I wanted to propose that maybe having a pet could be good emotional support, but I was fully prepared for a no if she said no and I never brought it up against after the argument. This is definitely not a case of getting pestered until the point of snapping because I had never ever even brought up the topic of pets, let alone having one for ourselves.

104,1e68vi8,AITA for refusing to continue paying for my sister's rent after she went on a trip without telling me?,"My (28f) sister (25f) got laid off about five months ago. She's really struggled to find another job in her since, as it's a really bad for her field, and people are being laid off left and right. She's currently working as a waitress while she looks for a more permanent job, but isn't earning enough to fully cover her rent.

I have a pretty well paying job, and I share rent with my partner, so I offered to help her cover the rent while she looks for another job. She was extremely grateful, and together we agreed on an amount which would allow her to cover rent and also have some money left over for food, travel etc. It's important to note that her monthly expenses for food, travel, bills etc were all provided by her.

I didn't have any issues, or suspect that anything was amiss. She hates working as a waitress so I'm confident that she is doing everything in her power to find another job. The last time I saw her, she mentioned that she has picked up a few extra shifts recently so that she can afford to get our parents a nice anniversary gift, so I figured she was basically living paycheck to paycheck.

Fast forward to now, and I've just received word from our cousin that my sister is in Paris. When I expressed confusion, my cousin sent me a bunch of screenshots from my sister's Instagram. My sister must have blocked me and my parents on there, because none of us could see any of her posts or stories.

I was very confused, then angry, because if she is living paycheck to paycheck, how on earth can she afford to go on a trip to Europe? For context, we live in Australia, and plane tickets typically cost upwards of $1000, and that's not accounting for food, hotels, or anything else.

I was so pissed that not only has she gone on an expensive trip, she clearly tried to hide it from me. I ended up sending her a few short messages, basically saying that I knew she was in Europe and that clearly she doesn't need my help paying rent anymore if she can afford a big trip.

She called me, and was basically in tears begging me not to cut her off. She said that she is on the trip with her new boyfriend, and that he is paying for everything. She insisted that she still needs the money to cover her rent, and that she will have to move if I don't help her. I basically told her that it was her problem now, and hung up, which I admit was childish of me but I was still so mad.

I don't know much about her new boyfriend, so maybe he is a millionaire or something, but the fact that she tried to hide it from me sets off alarm bells. I'll obviously have a proper discussion with her when she gets back, but for now I'm going to block her number.

Since then, she has reached out to some other family members, who think I'm being too harsh and should give her the benefit of the doubt. They all seem to think I'm going to force her to be out on the streets.

It's looking like this will be a whole fiasco once she gets back. I need an outside opinion. AITA?

Update: Thanks for all the responses!

I decided that at the very least I should let my sister explain herself, so I rang her again after I had calmed down. She said that the trip was a very last minute thing, and that her boyfriend was already going to Europe and he offered to pay for her plane ticket so she could come along with him and she felt that it was too good of an offer to pass up. When I asked about other expenses, she told me that he was mostly paying for everything and she only had to contribute a small amount. When I asked her where she got the money for that, she got kinda defensive and said that she had saved some money while working as a waitress, and that it wasn't fair that I was judging her for just trying to have a break, and that's why she didn't tell me.

I did bring up that he could help her pay rent, but she said that they hadn't been dating for that long, and she doesn't feel comfortable asking him. I think he comes from quite a well-off family, and she doesn't want to come across like a gold-digger. I do get this, I think it would be weird to ask someone you hadn't known for that long.

I do believe her for the most part, but I'm still pissed that she didn't tell me and that she clearly did have some money saved that could have been used to contribute to rent. I'm also pretty convinced that the money she said would go towards a gift for our parents also got spent on the trip, which feels a bit scummy.

I did stand my ground about no longer paying her rent, but I did agree to discuss it again once she got back. However, I will definitely ask to see her bank statements before I give her a cent more, and if it turns out she has been scamming me then not only will I not give her any more money but I will make her pay back what I loaned her.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-18,"AITA for refusing to continue paying for my sister's rent after she went on a trip without telling me?

The difference between us is I always knew I was adopted but Savannah found out from another cousin in March. Now she's having a really hard time with the truth and she has all these questions. But her parents never wanted her to know, they never wanted to answer them, and there have been some really bad reactions over her questions. My parents tried to tell my aunt (mom's sister) and uncle (aunt's husband) they should be honest. Given they had adopted me. But my aunt and uncle said our stories were different and she didn't need to know.

Last Saturday my maternal family were all together to celebrate my aunt's birthday and Savannah was isolated from everyone else, intentionally. She stayed indoors while everyone went outdoors and went outdoors when everyone came indoors. I noticed and told my parents and mentioned I was going to talk to Savannah. She was upset and I asked her if she wanted to talk and she said I wouldn't get it and I said not everything but from adoptee to adoptee I might get it the best. She was saying how she asked her parents and our grandparents some questions about her adoption and they asked why she wanted to know, if they'd done something wrong and was that why she was asking and they told her questions like that made them feel not good enough. She said she hadn't wanted them to feel that way but she had so many questions. She asked me if I ever asked about my ""other parents"" which is how she refers to her birth parents and whether I wanted to know them. I answered her honestly no, but I told her my parents were always open books if I wanted to, and they reassured me of that my whole life. I told her I had no interest in knowing more. That I was never going to try to find anyone in my birth family. But a lot of adoptees felt differently than me and that was good too. That we all get to make those decisions. And I told her nobody should pressure or guilt her into not asking questions.

She was way happier but I guess after the party she asked some more questions and repeated what I had said and mentioned we talked, because then my aunt called and screamed at my mom and I heard her call me all sorts of insults to my mom until mom told her to go fuck herself and grow up and be a better parent like Savannah deserves.

106,1e68ls0,AITA for trusting my niece with my parents‚Äô care?,"
(Posting from the perspective of the AH in question, this happened several years ago, between 2011 and 2019)

My (58M) parents were in decline for a number of years. They are stubborn and conservative, always have been, and don‚Äôt like outside help. I have two brothers and a sister, my sister is estranged from the family, but my brothers and I have never felt that our parents are our responsibility. We have our own successful careers and families to contend with, our parents should have prepared for their own decline appropriately. No one gave us handouts, we don‚Äôt think that we should have to give handouts, you know? 

However, I still accepted the designation of Power of Attorney for my mother with the understanding that when the time came to assume it, I would. The POA for my father was held by my mother, and as he declined with Lewy Body Dementia, she was in charge of his care with the help of visiting nurses and the medical team afforded by his Tricare for Life. Despite that, he was falling often, becoming confused and aggressive, and sometimes even inappropriate sexually. My mother was asking me and my other locally living brother (at the time both myself and my older brother were living in Florida, as well as our parents, albeit some hours distance) to come help more and more often. I suggested she find other help, as we are busy with our careers and families (I have two teenage daughters, both outstanding athletes with bright futures, my brother has two adult children, one of whom is enlisted in the Coast Guard as an officer, married with two kids,
and the other is a former airman who is now married to a deployed airman, with four children).

As it worked out, my niece called my parents looking for help herself. She had been estranged from the family for about five years and was now 22 and somehow unable to make her rent. The story from her mother five years before was that she‚Äôd been a horrible nightmare of a teenager and had chosen to run away to live a life of decadence after discovering drugs. Her mother, my sister, has always been extremely strict and controlling over her, I guess she had the right idea. My sister is estranged from the family because of her own behavior; she got pregnant with her daughter at 19 and sex out of wedlock is not something we support in this family, let alone single mothers. My parents should have been stricter on her and maybe she would not have ruined her life. I don‚Äôt know the details, but what she shared with us was enough to make me certain that her daughter was going down the same path. My niece had called us a few months after her mother said she‚Äôd run away, she called my wife upset about ‚Äúabuse‚Äù in her mother‚Äôs home and wanting us to take her in. We said we would call her back, we didn‚Äôt, obviously. So a few years after that she called my parents. She was and had been supposedly working full time overnights as a waitress, but she couldn‚Äôt make her rent? She must have been spending her money on other things. Anyway. She asked my parents for a loan of $900, they told her no, not telling her that it was because they knew she would just blow it on drugs, and they offered for her to come live with them 1200 miles away from her home as a fresh start and some proper supervision in a good, morally upstanding household. All she had to do was help out.

She was a disaster when she showed up. Covered in tattoos, obese, and with a GED because she didn‚Äôt finish high school (which she blames her mother for of course, something about unschooling). She swore like a sailor and openly admitted to engaging in homosexual activities. She had bottles of pills she claimed were prescribed for her ‚ÄúPTSD‚Äù, which I knew was total BS; my older brother fought in the Gulf War and doesn‚Äôt have PTSD. What‚Äôs her problem?? She was good enough at lifting my dad off the floor, though. And helping when he would get confused and aggressive. I was glad she was there the nights they had to call 911 to help deescalate him; something about him trying to assemble a rifle and my niece having to break down a door? I don‚Äôt know all the details, I was busy. Anyway, my dad died after a few years and my brothers and I flew to their house to clear out his gun collection and see what other things we could keep to remember him by. My niece was still there, not doing much with her life and constantly complaining that she couldn‚Äôt get access to the ‚Äúmental health care‚Äù she was used to up north. I guess the dealers in Florida just weren‚Äôt up to her expectations. We took my niece with us when we took my mom out to Longhorn during our visits and razzed her, when are you going to move out? When are you going to go to college? She just pouted and complained about the things she believes were preventing her, like her ‚Äúdisability‚Äù and her ‚Äúlack of education‚Äù. 

My mother began to decline herself, but refused to go to the doctor after her PCP suggested she be evaluated for Alzheimer‚Äôs. She drove herself to Maine and back, the day she got home, she passed out on the floor and my niece found her cold and in a pool of vomit hours later. She called 911 and my mom was fine; my niece was at work and she needed to step up checking in on her grandmother. I visited twice in the following two years while my mother declined, then I didn‚Äôt want to anymore because she refused to turn on the air conditioning in her house. It was Florida! It was too hot for me. My niece was full of complaints about it, of course, but I told her that she was lucky to be living rent free and should be grateful. Honestly? I was hoping maybe she‚Äôd realize part of why she was so hot was because she was obese and that she would want to lose some weight. She kept me updated on my mother‚Äôs health, but she had no success convincing her to go to the neurologist, which she really should have tried harder. I called periodically with suggestions for her, like cleaning out the garage and starting to clean out the house so that when Mom died, we could sell it quickly. She started asking me if I would come to Florida for a week to give her a break. Especially after she quit her full time job, she said my mother was too needy at home for her to be able to work anymore! I thought that was ridiculous; my niece was lazy. She started to get really dramatic, even told us that she had put herself in the psych ward for a couple of days but that she had to leave because she needed to get home to my mother. She really ramped up the drama later that summer when she informed us that she had actually attempted to take her own life, while in my mother‚Äôs house. I and my wife told her that maybe she could look into support groups for family caregivers. We told her that we might be able to make it out for a visit in December to give her a little bit of a break, but we had no intention of actually doing it. 

I guess by the end of that year, she was frustrated with our lack of response to her manipulation. It was obvious that all she wanted was to go back to where she knew she could get the drugs she needed; she frequently complained that it had been years since she‚Äôd seen her ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. She called me up at 10pm one night and demanded, not asked, that I figure ‚Äúsomething‚Äù out, because my mother had gotten violent with her and she was leaving in two weeks. I told her I would, but the night before she was due to leave, I called and tried to tell her that I really thought moving would be terrible for her mental health, it‚Äôs one of the most destabilizing events a person can experience. She told me she was leaving anyway and abandoned my mother. The neighbors called the police after two weeks because my mother was confused and not eating, leaning against the mailbox. I had to drop everything and go deal with the mess my niece created, and get my mother into a nursing home. During the process she was finally evaluated by a neurologist and they found lesions and atrophy in her brain suggesting advanced Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. My niece should have been on top of this! She should have done a better job convincing my mother to go to the doctor. 

Somehow though, my daughter is telling me that I am the one in the wrong here? My wife and I don‚Äôt think so, and my brother‚Äôs wife and I are considering pressing charges for elder abuse. AITA?",TL;DR,2024-07-18,"AITA for trusting my niece with my parents‚Äô care?

She was and had been supposedly working full time overnights as a waitress, but she couldn‚Äôt make her rent? She must have been spending her money on other things. Anyway. She asked my parents for a loan of $900, they told her no, not telling her that it was because they knew she would just blow it on drugs, and they offered for her to come live with them 1200 miles away from her home as a fresh start and some proper supervision in a good, morally upstanding household. All she had to do was help out.

She was a disaster when she showed up. Covered in tattoos, obese, and with a GED because she didn‚Äôt finish high school (which she blames her mother for of course, something about unschooling). She swore like a sailor and openly admitted to engaging in homosexual activities. She had bottles of pills she claimed were prescribed for her ‚ÄúPTSD‚Äù, which I knew was total BS; my older brother fought in the Gulf War and doesn‚Äôt have PTSD. What‚Äôs her problem?? She was good enough at lifting my dad off the floor, though. And helping when he would get confused and aggressive. I was glad she was there the nights they had to call 911 to help deescalate him; something about him trying to assemble a rifle and my niece having to break down a door? I don‚Äôt know all the details, I was busy. Anyway, my dad died after a few years and my brothers and I flew to their house to clear out his gun collection and see what other things we could keep to remember him by. My niece was still there, not doing much with her life and constantly complaining that she couldn‚Äôt get access to the ‚Äúmental health care‚Äù she was used to up north. I guess the dealers in Florida just weren‚Äôt up to her expectations. We took my niece with us when we took my mom out to Longhorn during our visits and razzed her, when are you going to move out? When are you going to go to college? She just pouted and complained about the things she believes were preventing her, like her ‚Äúdisability‚Äù and her ‚Äúlack of education‚Äù. 

My mother began to decline herself, but refused to go to the doctor after her PCP suggested she be evaluated for Alzheimer‚Äôs. She drove herself to Maine and back, the day she got home, she passed out on the floor and my niece found her cold and in a pool of vomit hours later. She called 911 and my mom was fine; my niece was at work and she needed to step up checking in on her grandmother. I visited twice in the following two years while my mother declined, then I didn‚Äôt want to anymore because she refused to turn on the air conditioning in her house. It was Florida! It was too hot for me. My niece was full of complaints about it, of course, but I told her that she was lucky to be living rent free and should be grateful. Honestly? I was hoping maybe she‚Äôd realize part of why she was so hot was because she was obese and that she would want to lose some weight. She kept me updated on my mother‚Äôs health, but she had no success convincing her to go to the neurologist, which she really should have tried harder. I called periodically with suggestions for her, like cleaning out the garage and starting to clean out the house so that when Mom died, we could sell it quickly. She started asking me if I would come to Florida for a week to give her a break. Especially after she quit her full time job, she said my mother was too needy at home for her to be able to work anymore! I thought that was ridiculous; my niece was lazy. She started to get really dramatic, even told us that she had put herself in the psych ward for a couple of days but that she had to leave because she needed to get home to my mother. She really ramped up the drama later that summer when she informed us that she had actually attempted to take her own life, while in my mother‚Äôs house. I and my wife told her that maybe she could look into support groups for family caregivers. We told her that we might be able to make it out for a visit in December to give her a little bit of a break, but we had no intention of actually doing it. 

I guess by the end of that year, she was frustrated with our lack of response to her manipulation. It was obvious that all she wanted was to go back to where she knew she could get the drugs she needed; she frequently complained that it had been years since she‚Äôd seen her ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. She called me up at 10pm one night and demanded, not asked, that I figure ‚Äúsomething‚Äù out, because my mother had gotten violent with her and she was leaving in two weeks. I told her I would, but the night before she was due to leave, I called and tried to tell her that I really thought moving would be terrible for her mental health, it‚Äôs one of the most destabilizing events a person can experience. She told me she was leaving anyway and abandoned my mother. The neighbors called the police after two weeks because my mother was confused and not eating, leaning against the mailbox. I had to drop everything and go deal with the mess my niece created, and get my mother into a nursing home. During the process she was finally evaluated by a neurologist and they found lesions and atrophy in her brain suggesting advanced Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. My niece should have been on top of this! She should have done a better job convincing my mother to go to the doctor. 

Somehow though, my daughter is telling me that I am the one in the wrong here? My wife and I don‚Äôt think so, and my brother‚Äôs wife and I are considering pressing charges for elder abuse. AITA?",,1.0388940572738647,1,0
107,1e67omo,AITA for threatening to call the cops on my ex?,"Last night, my (F30) ex boyfriend (M38) showed up at my door unannounced and uninvited. It was already pretty late, around 10:30 PM.

Fast forward to this month. I thought everything has cooled down by now. I reached out to him to get some of my things that I left in his apartment. He acted all cool and says he'll just send them over. He gets my address and sends me my things back. Now, he has my new address.

He texted me this morning accusing me of overreacting. It wasn't his intention to harass me. He just wanted to make amends. He says it was his final attempt at reaching out and I would never hear from him again. Now I feel like a dick. Did I really overreact?

108,1e67awj,AITA for not taking in my brother and telling my mother to stick to her plans?,"I (M24) moved out 2 years ago. At te same time my brother (Ben 40) lost his job and got kicked out of his apartment. We have 2 sisters, Terra 28 and Vicky 32.

Terra had just moved into a bigger apartment with her husband and kids at that time and she decided to take in Ben, cause our mother didn't want to. He got the room of my nephew (1 at the time).

In these 2 years Ben has done basically nothing, he stopped giving my sister money over a year ago and spends it all on cigarettes and beer. He just sits on his computer and plays games all day.

Last week my sister decided that she wants Ben out by the beginning of august. Her kids are constantly fighting and she thinks it'll get better once Ben is out. But she didn't really plan anything out properly. She just decided to have him move into our mothers place without asking about it first.

Terra, Vicky and i have a groupchat and these two were just texting about what they need to get done to move Ben in with our mother. ""we need to talk to her landlord about putting him on the paperwork"" ""when he moves out of her place, she \[our mother\] can sign off on the papers that he has no rent debt"" all this bs. They're already 5 steps ahead, they're already talking about him moving out of our mothers place one day.

I sat down with our mother last sunday and asked her about the whole situation. My sister had just made one suggestion over the phone about this. just a ""how about he moves in with you"" and nothing more. She doesn't want to give up her spare room, she's already been through this whole thing with him once before when he was around 20.

On sunday evening i got a call from my mother. She had talked to Ben and he was told that she wanted to take him in, my sister told him that i assume. He got mad and told her off for not wanting to take him in. I told her that she shouldn't let my sisters strong arm her into this and that Ben had 2 years to do anything about this. She's worried she might come home from her vacation and find him moved in since my sisters and i all have keys to her Apartment. 

My sisters are pissed at me for not being on their side, i was told ""really lovely how you react to a family emergency, as long as you're fine"". But this isn't an emergency, it's been the norm for 2 years now. I will not take him in either, my boyfriend and i have talked about it and we don't want to give up our hooy room for the next 2 years just so we can feed a grown man and see no improvement. i just wish my sister had given everyone some time to plan this out. if she had just said something 2 or 3 months ago it would all go a bit smoother.

109,1e679hz,WIBTA If I don't visit my grandmother? (family drama),"My (20F) nuclear family has been estranged from my extended family for several years due to the estrangement of a close family member that my nuclear family chose to keep in touch with. Big family drama, but the family member who was kicked out of the family and who my nuclear family is supporting is really lovely and didn't do something wrong.

What I need advice on is the following.

My grandmother is in her 90s and lives in a different country from me and my nuclear family. She lives in the same country that my extended family lives in. Because of this drama, I haven't seen her in a few years but I call her almost every day. I used to visit her about once a year for many weeks with my nuclear family but now we are unwelcome (not by my grandmother, who is not able to do anything) by the extended family who are preventing my parents from staying at my grandmother's apartment and have installed cameras with audio around her apartment.

I have a lot of trust in my parents and we have a great loving relationship. They think it is most important for my grandmother to maintain her good memories of our family rather than superceding them with a depressing visit, so they decided not to visit her (they call her every day or two and love her very much). If I were to visit her on my own I would not be welcome to sleep over and could only visit (unless I decide to go against the extended family's wishes and essentially dare them to kick me out). I can't drive so we couldn't really do anything, and I would have to find somewhere else to stay. On the other hand, I know my grandmother really wants to see me and I want to see her but haven't since I understand my parents' point that it is better for her to have the image of a good family in her mind. When we talk she loves discussing ""the last time she saw us"" and what fun we had. Seeing me without my nuclear or extended family or any family activities may be worse for her in the long run (not to mention if I would have to interact with the extended family).

The reason I am reconsidering again (I have gone back and forth several times over the years) is because the family member who is estranged from the family really thinks I should see my grandmother so that I won't regret not seeing her. I also understand this, but have been inclined to be selfless and do what's best for my grandmother. However, he also thinks that my parents (with whom he has a great relationship) are wrong that this is the least bad thing for her.

My extended family takes advantage of my grandmother financially and don't visit her as often as they should, considering their extremely close proximity to her. My parents don't think I should go, but they said that if I decide to then they would pay for the associated costs and would not be upset with me.

110,1e679ei,WIBTA for refusing to loan 2k to my stepdad?,"First-time poster, long-time lurker.

For some background and context, I (20f) live mostly with my mum and stepdad. I also spend time at my dad's house and boyfriend's house but my mum's house is the most convenient in terms of commuting to my job. I am currently taking a gap year from any study and am working full time in a lower-paying education-based job and have saved a little over 20k in my bank account for my future. It has taken me 5 years to save this much money. I don't currently pay any sort of rent or board at my mum and stepdad's house but there have been discussions and I have stated that I'm open to it. Although I don't have my license yet, my mum and dad bought a second-hand car for me that I am paying off and I pay for the registration and insurance as well as any servicing it needs. I do all of my own laundry and help my mum out with other household chores and cleaning when I am staying at her place. In my opinion, I pull my weight considering my age and current situation.

Additionally, I think it is important to mention that my stepdad and I have a very complicated relationship. He has been in my life since I was 7 and he has been both verbally and emotionally abusive to my mum and me the entire time I have known him. I have learned to deal with it and I am not around him that much anyway since I am either always working or with my boyfriend. My feelings toward him are also extremely complicated as we have had a lot of good moments throughout the years but I can't forget what he has put me through. He and my mum are also extremely financially irresponsible. My stepdad especially complains constantly about how much debt he's in and how he can't pay our rent yet in the last 2 years, he bought my mum a brand new 70k car, went on a month-long Europe trip with my mum, and has bought himself the latest iPhone, apple watch and iPad as well as a large number of other expensive items. This has always frustrated me.

My stepdad recently sold his car and bought a second-hand BMW. The BMW needs repairs and he claims to be low on money my mum has informed me he wants me to loan him 2k to pay for this. I really don't want to give him this money as I think it is his and my mum's fault they don't have enough to pay for it because they waste the little money they do have on things they don't need. My boyfriend agrees with me and is adamant that I should not give him the money but he hates my stepdad and could be biased as a result so I am unsure. I also don't think he deserves any of the money that I have worked so hard to save and I know he and my mum will guilt-trip me once I say no.

The only thing that is making me think I would be in the wrong is that we moved house 2 months ago so my mum and stepdad actually have a possibly legitimate reason for being a bit low on money.

**‚ÄúFamily‚Äù members:** Father M60, step-mom/dad‚Äôs wife of 1 year (6 months after the Jackpot) F55, her 2 adult daughters (mid-30s) and my brother m25. Brother grew up with dad, I grew up with our (bpd, as in borderline personality disorder) mother. My parents split when I was 3 so I have no memory of that time or prior. We‚Äôre all working class.¬†Dad and I had started building a relationship in the past 4 years or so, talking at least every other week and meeting up sometimes.

**Triggering event:** Father winning over 10 millions on a fucking lottery.¬†

**Request:** For me to sign away future inheritance. Made by step-mother and brother.¬†

**Conflict:** I don‚Äôt want to.¬†

**The reason I think maybe I should**: My brother does have a point when he says that this man was no father to me, and I was no daughter to him.

The same reason is my main reason why I actually should keep my future inheritance. It‚Äôs not like you get a new dad just because the first one walks out, and if anything I think maybe I deserve more than my brother since at least he got the less shitshowy-parent even if he was unavailable.¬†

‚Äì¬†

So, around a year ago my dad, who I barely know, won a lot of money. I mean a totally life-changing amount. His then gf became his wife, they bought a few properties, went on vacations and invested some. All good, right? - Not really since we live in a country where you can not write your children out of your will. None of the above-mentioned people has paid much attention to me over the years, until now that is. At first I was so happy for dad since I did know he has struggled in the past. I was close with my paternal grandmother and her main caregiver (live-in) 2 out of her 5 last years in life, so she did tell me a lot about him and his life. I always wondered so I asked my questions, I didn't mean to be nosy or anything. I just wanted to know how everything had been since he left mom, as I grew to understand that borderline-women are not for everyone. I did not blame him very much after my childhood with mom.¬†

Anyway, a couple weeks ago my step-mother accused me of only being interested in my dad due to him winning the lottery, and once I rejected that accusation she asked me to prove it by officially giving up my future inheritance (children are entitled to sharing 50% of what would be left, so in my case with 1 sibling that‚Äôs 25% of his wealth). She offered to pay for the legal assistance in this. My brother added in basically claiming I have no right to anything as my mother‚Äôs kid and that I‚Äôm not my dad‚Äôs daughter in any important sense so I shouldn‚Äôt inherit. 

Today my step-mothers oldest texted me asking if I had made up my mind. I told her yes and that I will keep any rights to future inheritances. She called me an asshole for not seeing their take. She told me she'll call my brother and to expect follow-up later today. 

So, am I an asshole here? Maybe I'm too in it to see it myself(?)

My brother added in basically claiming I have no right to anything as my mother‚Äôs kid and that I‚Äôm not my dad‚Äôs daughter in any important sense so I shouldn‚Äôt inherit. 

Today my step-mothers oldest texted me asking if I had made up my mind. I told her yes and that I will keep any rights to future inheritances. She called me an asshole for not seeing their take. She told me she'll call my brother and to expect follow-up later today. 

So, am I an asshole here? Maybe I'm too in it to see it myself(?)

Hi, I‚Äôm Catherine , and I have been seeing this boy named Nathan . We‚Äôre schoolmates. We rarely see each other because my schedule is in the morning, and his class schedule is in the afternoon. I didn‚Äôt even know he existed until April 2024 when we became prom partners. The school admin arranged and decided our partners. All the students practiced for weeks, and over time, Nathan and I caught feelings for each other. The feelings I had for him were just a crush. I wasn‚Äôt expecting more than that. At that time, I had no idea that he had feelings for me. Our prom night finally came, and right after I got home, I added him on Facebook (I also added my other schoolmates who attended the prom). He accepted my request, and we sometimes messaged each other about school. To me, it was just friendly talk; I didn‚Äôt give it much meaning. Months passed, and he sometimes messaged me saying he would treat me to ice cream. Then June came, and our graduation was around the corner. My best friends kept encouraging me to confess my feelings because they had a feeling that Nathan also had feelings for me. While they said those words, I just laughed it off, convincing myself to keep my composure and not be delusional. 

Then, two days before our graduation, a close female friend of Nathan messaged me and told me that Nathan had feelings for me. I was flabbergasted. I asked her, ‚ÄúHow come?‚Äù and she sent me a screenshot of her convo with Nathan saying, ‚Äúbecause she‚Äôs pretty.‚Äù Basically, he likes me because of my appearance. I had mixed feelings about what he said. I didn‚Äôt know whether to celebrate because my crush liked me back or to be disappointed because he liked me because of my face.

The night before our graduation, I wrote him a confession letter that took me 4 hours to finish. I gave it to him right after the graduation ended. The letter I made was 4‚Äô11‚Äù long (I measured it lol). Then he sent me his response through Messenger, saying he had feelings for me too and he would like us to be more than friends. This shocked me because I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to go that far. We still talk now. I was waiting for him to ask me, ‚ÄúCan I court you?‚Äù or ‚ÄúPwede ba ako manligaw?‚Äù It‚Äôs almost one month that we‚Äôve been in this situationship. I know for sure that he wants us to be official. He might not have said it to me directly, but I can see it through his actions. He makes it obvious and tells me indirectly that we should put a label on our relationship.

I‚Äôm not going to lie; I‚Äôm disappointed because he‚Äôs moving too fast. He wants us to be together immediately. Like, dude, you don‚Äôt even know much about me, and I don‚Äôt know much about you either. We‚Äôve never had a long or meaningful conversation, and you‚Äôre saying you want us to be together?

Oh my gosh, he even talks about getting married and having kids with me in the future. I find this uncomfortable because, first of all, we‚Äôre not even officially together, and second, we‚Äôre TOO YOUNG to talk about that. Personally, I feel uneasy when a guy I‚Äôm not close to talks about such things. It bothers me.

On the bright side, Nathan is kind, tall, smart, sweet, athletic, and super clingy towards me. But little by little, I became distant because of the reasons I mentioned above. I also don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs just genuinely sweet or if he‚Äôs trying to manipulate me because he‚Äôs spamming me with TikTok videos with captions like, ‚ÄúI hope you won‚Äôt leave me,‚Äù ‚ÄúI really want to marry you someday,‚Äù ‚ÄúKisses for you,‚Äù and many more. Am I just overthinking? He also sends TikTok videos saying, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre perfect,‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gorgeous,‚Äù ‚ÄúI love everything about you,‚Äù which I find odd because, like I said, he doesn‚Äôt know much about me, and neither do I know much about him. When we started talking, I was waiting for him to get to know me better because I told him we should get to know each other first. A week passed, and NOTHING. So, I started the conversation about getting to know each other. Can you believe it? I didn‚Äôt even know basic information about him, like his birthday, favorite color, dish, or drink, until I suggested we get to know each other better. Guys, it‚Äôs been almost one month that we‚Äôve been in this situationship, and our conversations revolve around sending TikTok videos to each other. He sends a lot every day, while I don‚Äôt send more than three videos to him each day.

I‚Äôm starting to lose interest. There‚Äôs no effort from him‚Äîjust sending TikTok videos. I‚Äôm not even kidding. Yes, he‚Äôs decent, not a playboy, and I don‚Äôt need to worry about another girl. But guys, help! I don‚Äôt know what to do. Are my feelings valid? Why does it feel like I don‚Äôt have the right to think this way? I feel bad. I feel suffocated. He‚Äôs not toxic, but why does it feel like this? I can‚Äôt show my true self to him because I don‚Äôt know him well enough yet, and I‚Äôm still figuring things out. I want to talk to him, but it‚Äôs hard because he doesn‚Äôt know how to hold a conversation (I‚Äôve noticed). Gosh, is he really in love with me, or is he in love with the version of myself that he created in his head?

Should I just continue? I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, PLEASE HELP ME ‚òπÔ∏è

114,1e66lmp,AITA for not helping my sister with her creditors?,"I (44F) have a sister (46F) and she hasn‚Äôt made the best decisions in life when she was younger. She married young and has 3 children from 3 different fathers, has difficulty keeping a job, and managing money.

I thought she was on the mend - she recently found a new job as a receptionist in a good salon and is earning money for her and her son (the youngest is the only one with her). But a few weeks back, she sent me a message that:
1. She got a loan from an online lender;
2. She has only been able to pay the minimum amount every week;
3. The loan has ballooned to quite a large amount;
4. The online lender has been threatening her since she cannot settle her loan.

Now she is asking me to cough up Php50-100k so she can settle the loan and then she‚Äôll pay me back on a monthly basis for 2-2.5yrs instead.

I am the only one who has a good paying job and has always been helping my siblings out when needed. In fact, before the message above, she borrowed 3.5k from me and is already past the date she promised to give it back. I am also paying for an HMO for her so she can get medical support if she needs it (her work doesn‚Äôt have one). 

But borrowing 50-100k?!? Just because she knows I am good at saving money for long-term purposes? I told her I can‚Äôt and that the only money I can lend her is what I am saving for her HMO. She gets the money, I cancel her HMO benefit until she pays me back.

After a lot of hemming and hawing, she agreed to it. I gave her ~15k to help out.

But after a few weeks, she‚Äôs telling me that she‚Äôs getting threats again because she can‚Äôt keep up with the payments. And that I NEED to help her close out the loan because she‚Äôs gonna die because of it.

I told her NO - I also have a family with our own expenses esp since my eldest will be in college soon and my husband has more expensive maintenance meds that we have to save up for. I will not touch the money I am saving up for my retirement (since I‚Äôm a freelancer with no retirement benefits).

Then she begged, pleaded, told me that I‚Äôm the only one she can turn to and emphasized that she will die if I don‚Äôt help out. I told her that I can‚Äôt once again.

Then she asked if I can take out a loan (use my name, give her the money) and she‚Äôll repay it afterwards. Of course I said no because if she defaults, I have to pay it out.

She then told me that i HAVE TO HELP her because I‚Äôm her sister - like it‚Äôs my obligation to help her out.

I have since muted her Messenger acct and am ignoring any messages she‚Äôs sending me because I really can‚Äôt give her what she wants.

I feel guilty because if something does happen to her, it will be on my conscience but I also don‚Äôt want to end up paying for her loan/financial mistakes. I also need the money for my family.

so i (18f) have a really bad sleeping issue, i never wake up unless woken up violently. i think im a very deep sleeper, so all my life ive had problems with oversleeping or pulling an all nighter to study because i cant rely on myself to wake up early. very rarely i *do* wake up at 6 am, but thats only ever happened during my exam sessions when im allowed to keep multiple alarms.

recently though, its becoming more of an issue. like all my family, i go to bed at 11/12, try to sleep, until its 1 or 2 am and the sheer boredom just conks me out. that ends up to me waking up at 12 m at the minimum, or 1pm (if someone deigns to call me until i wake up). this led to my mom and dad (mainly my mom) yelling at me and insulting me all the time and whenever something goes wrong and blaming it on me oversleeping (eg, your brother got hurt because you sleep till 1pm and cant even look afte your brother). it really hurts me because ive constantly told them to wake me up or at least let me keep an alarm in my room (they take away all our devices at night claiming that i use my phone instead of sleeping). they refuse, saying that they all wake up at 8 or 9 am without alarms, and compare me to my brother who wakes up at 8 am on his own because he has school, and claims im not a student because no student sleeps for 12 or 14 hours, and i should also wake up like them

and when i pester them enough (talking back and keeping calm while they scream) they claim they call me mutiple times until i get up and tell them im waking up, but i have no recollection of ever saying any of that when i do wake up. or if they wake me up, they call me once or twice before leaving me be. is it really a wake up call if i cant even hear them? and then proceeds to call me a b\*tch for sleeping s much and that ill fail and my whole life will be miserable. she says im lazy and ive told her a few times that maybe its a sleeping disorder but she says im wrong, telling me that all the doctor will do is tell me im a lazy bum and make me change my sleeping schedule.

recently though, its becoming more of an issue. like all my family, i go to bed at 11/12, try to sleep, until its 1 or 2 am and the sheer boredom just conks me out. that ends up to me waking up at 12 m at the minimum, or 1pm (if someone deigns to call me until i wake up). this led to my mom and dad (mainly my mom) yelling at me and insulting me all the time and whenever something goes wrong and blaming it on me oversleeping (eg, your brother got hurt because you sleep till 1pm and cant even look afte your brother). it really hurts me because ive constantly told them to wake me up or at least let me keep an alarm in my room (they take away all our devices at night claiming that i use my phone instead of sleeping). they refuse, saying that they all wake up at 8 or 9 am without alarms, and compare me to my brother who wakes up at 8 am on his own because he has school, and claims im not a student because no student sleeps for 12 or 14 hours, and i should also wake up like them

and when i pester them enough (talking back and keeping calm while they scream) they claim they call me mutiple times until i get up and tell them im waking up, but i have no recollection of ever saying any of that when i do wake up. or if they wake me up, they call me once or twice before leaving me be. is it really a wake up call if i cant even hear them? and then proceeds to call me a b\*tch for sleeping s much and that ill fail and my whole life will be miserable. she says im lazy and ive told her a few times that maybe its a sleeping disorder but she says im wrong, telling me that all the doctor will do is tell me im a lazy bum and make me change my sleeping schedule.

so, am i the asshole for not waking up? they really make me feel like i am but they make me feel like a asshole for a lot of things so im not sure if i really am at fault here",3.0,0.05274715647101402,0,0
118,1e6677v,AITA for asking my boyfriend to pay me back for the cost of a trip that he canceled? ,"I (28F) have been dating a guy (39M) for about 2 months but friends for 2 years. Let's call him Russ. Russ had a business trip where he‚Äôd be in Boston from a Tuesday to Thursday. He invited me to come and I said I could fly on a Friday to meet there and we fly back early on a Monday. He and his company agreed, as they needed to know to properly compensate his flights. I pay for my tickets ($456) and he pays for his ($500).

One morning, I got in my car at my apartment parking lot, and I see a rose on my windshield. A single rose with a long green stem, intentionally placed since it was half tucked under my driver side wiper. I asked Russ if he gave it to me. He said no wtf. I live in a gated complex which rules out randoms leaving it. I described to Russ how creeped out I felt about the rose. We still don‚Äôt know who left it. Russ was supportive and said he‚Äôll walk me to my car from now on. He told me to park next to his Tesla, to which he will enable sentry mode to record suspicious nearby activity. He even bought me pepper spray. I felt that was very nice and shared how much I appreciated it. I get home and as we're walking Russ says he canceled his Tuesday flight to Boston. I'm like wait what? He says he did it to keep walking me to my car for my safety. I never expected him to go as far as cancel his business trip for me. I was shocked but appreciative. The new plan was that he doesn't attend the business trip and move his flight to Friday like mine.

Two days before departure, Russ says he has a bad headache. This isn't news as he's had it for a few days. We tried a few things to alleviate it but it's not improving and he questions if he can go on the trip. I suggested he go to urgent care and offered to join but he insisted on going alone. Before seeking care, he decides on not going to Boston at all. I felt upset he decided to suddenly cancel without discussion. I asked if he could compensate the $456 I spent. He said no. I‚Äôm a cancer biology PhD student on a $28k stipend so not exactly rolling in money here. Russ is a software developer making more money than me. The Tesla I mentioned earlier? He paid for that upfront in cash. He‚Äôs losing $500 since his company won‚Äôt compensate his flights. He gets mad I asked for money since he ""made a sacrifice for me"" (referring to canceling his trip for me) ""so I should make a sacrifice for him"". I asked if he could pay for any cancellation fees. He said no, that he ""doesn't owe me shit."" He gets mad, saying I'm the asshole for not being more sympathetic about his headache and says it's not about the money. He went as far as threaten to break up with me. I said I'm sorry about the headache and grateful for the sacrifice he made (again, his own choice). But the fact is he invited me on a trip then canceled. We ended up canceling our flights and refunded via travel credit. I find the situation ridiculous and disliked how he talked to me. I suggested we take a break from dating while I think it over.

Out of anger, I texted her and asked her to choose between him or me. She struggled to pick, saying if she chose him, she'd lose me, and if she chose me, she'd lose the guy she fell in love with. I was like, LOVE? It's been 5 or 6 weeks, that's insane!

120,1e663qa,WIBTA for skipping a funeral?,"Some backstory: My (28f) parents (both in their late 50s) are currently on a month-long vacation in Europe. A few days ago my dad sent a picture of an 80-85 yo woman to our family group chat and said that she sadly passed that day. I wasn‚Äôt sure who she was but sent my condolences, and thought that would be it. 

Yesterday my dad called me to explain that the woman who had passed was the mother of one of his closest friends from high school (whom I have met a handful of times as a child). He also asked me to go since he won‚Äôt be able to. 

Here is where I may be the asshole‚Ä¶ I was hesitant on the phone with him, and told him that I would let him know for sure, but that I probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to make it. He was pretty angry about this and called me selfish. 

Here‚Äôs my perspective on it (that I also explained to my dad): the funeral is on Friday morning at 9AM, about 45 mins away from my house. I start work at 9AM, and am taking part in an important meeting at 9AM that I don‚Äôt want to miss. My boss is very understanding, and I‚Äôm sure if I pulled the ‚Äúfuneral card‚Äù she would let me skip the meeting, but I feel weird doing that for a strangers funeral. 
Another issue is that these people don‚Äôt know me and I don‚Äôt know them, I would probably be able to recognize them based off pictures, but I feel like it would be awkward and that I would be intruding.

It seems important to my dad that I go, he won‚Äôt stop texting me about it and sending pictures of $150-200 flower arrangements that are out of my price range.
He also tried ‚Äúthreatening‚Äù me by saying that he won‚Äôt buy me a souvenir if I don‚Äôt go. 

I feel bad but I really don‚Äôt want to go to this funeral. I‚Äôm not the most empathetic person and I don‚Äôt do well with sad people.  I‚Äôm not the most empathetic person and I don‚Äôt think my presence would be beneficial to anyone, especially since I have never met the deceased.

123,1e65rcq,AITA for not covering for my brother when he went to a party and came home at a home when he's not supposed to? ,"Me, 16 female and my brother 17 male. We  used to be close but have been arguing lately. Last night, my brother decided to go to his best friend's birthday party. My mother, aged 43 told him his curfew (to get home before 10:30 pm). He has some history with this friend for coming home later than he's supposed to. Which worries my mother, so they had an argument before he left for the party and he walked out with her screaming at him. I never overheard the argument because I really just mind my business. Fast forward until 12 am. He texts me asking if my mom was asleep and I told him he was. He knew he was in trouble when he gets home from storming out with my mother yelling at him. 2 am rolls around and I need to use the bathroom. This is a 1  bedroom apartment due to our financial problems but we won't talk about that. My bedroom door is like next to my mom's bed so when I open it. She hears it in her sleep. I couldn't really hold it long so I came out. She woke up, asked what time it was and asked if my brother was here. I told her it was 2 am and I didn't want to tell on him so I said nothing. She peeked into the bedroom saw he wasn't there and she told me to text him asking where he's at. My brother told me he was outside, which I'm guessing was a huge lie now but not then. I told my mother that he's outside and he'll come up soon. After 10 minutes she calls him saying ""get your fucking ass home"". It takes him about 5-10 minutes of her pacing around angrily until he came in. She yelled at him for being disrespectful and went on about him leaving the house while she was talking to him. When he came in our room. He was yelling at me about using his charger, which he said I could use. He threw the tablet at me from a short distance. I freaked out and cried because I was half asleep. This alerted my mother to yell at him more. To say, he has history of being upset at something and take it out onto people, so my mom said to him to stop taking out on me and I told my mom what he did and she was pissed. After that scolding, he told me to never talk to him again and he blocked me on Instagram and probably phone number. So am I the asshole for not doing anything? This isn't really my business until he took it out on me.. I'd like to see an outside perspective. I may be the asshole based on me freaking out and not lying immediately, but it was 2 am.



Hey, lemme tell you guys a bit more context, my brother's 18th birthday is in 2 days and 3 weeks from now and he's going to college around August the 27th, so either way if he's mad at me or not then he goes most likely I won't see him for a while which is fine. I have been trying my best all these years to help him out and kiss his feet. I dont really need it anymore. He could easily hide in my dad's house and don't come back until then (my dad's house is like in another state). I'm trying to be reasonable as I can but he has took it way too far. Arguments between my brother and my mother has been happening for weeks because of my father's behavior. I have an autistic sister that he would refuse to pick her up. He barely picks me up, so you know there's that. My mother got him for child's supper and hes mad over it. My mother got mad at my brother for basically ""ignoring about what he did to us"" us meaning me and my sister. My brother usually say he doesn't want to be apart of it. Basically, my father been paying child support for only me and my sister not my brother because he's not his biological child, and he also treats my brother way better than us. That could also been going on with my brothers behavior. Just the resentment for my mother, but anyway enjoy the more context. ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-18,"AITA for not covering for my brother when he went to a party and came home at a home when he's not supposed to?  Me, 16 female and my brother 17 male. We  used to be close but have been arguing lately. Last night, my brother decided to go to his best friend's birthday party. My mother, aged 43 told him his curfew (to get home before 10:30 pm). He has some history with this friend for coming home later than he's supposed to. Which worries my mother, so they had an argument before he left for the party and he walked out with her screaming at him. I never overheard the argument because I really just mind my business. Fast forward until 12 am. He texts me asking if my mom was asleep and I told him he was. He knew he was in trouble when he gets home from storming out with my mother yelling at him. 2 am rolls around and I need to use the bathroom. This is a 1  bedroom apartment due to our financial problems but we won't talk about that. My bedroom door is like next to my mom's bed so when I open it. She hears it in her sleep. I couldn't really hold it long so I came out. She woke up, asked what time it was and asked if my brother was here. I told her it was 2 am and I didn't want to tell on him so I said nothing. She peeked into the bedroom saw he wasn't there and she told me to text him asking where he's at. My brother told me he was outside, which I'm guessing was a huge lie now but not then. I told my mother that he's outside and he'll come up soon. After 10 minutes she calls him saying ""get your fucking ass home"". It takes him about 5-10 minutes of her pacing around angrily until he came in. She yelled at him for being disrespectful and went on about him leaving the house while she was talking to him. When he came in our room. He was yelling at me about using his charger, which he said I could use. He threw the tablet at me from a short distance. I freaked out and cried because I was half asleep. This alerted my mother to yell at him more. To say, he has history of being upset at something and take it out onto people, so my mom said to him to stop taking out on me and I told my mom what he did and she was pissed. After that scolding, he told me to never talk to him again and he blocked me on Instagram and probably phone number. So am I the asshole for not doing anything? This isn't really my business until he took it out on me.. I'd like to see an outside perspective. I may be the asshole based on me freaking out and not lying immediately, but it was 2 am.



Hey, lemme tell you guys a bit more context, my brother's 18th birthday is in 2 days and 3 weeks from now and he's going to college around August the 27th, so either way if he's mad at me or not then he goes most likely I won't see him for a while which is fine. I have been trying my best all these years to help him out and kiss his feet. I dont really need it anymore. He could easily hide in my dad's house and don't come back until then (my dad's house is like in another state). I'm trying to be reasonable as I can but he has took it way too far.

125,1e65j8e,AITA for kicking out my roommate's BF?,"Hi, I am (19F), doing my second year in college, and I live off campus in a paid guest hostel. The whole set up is that there are 2 people who share 1 room+bathroom in a floor with 5 rooms in total, and we all share a kitchen together. It is a co-ed hostel, but two people of different sexes can't share one room. My first roommate graduated last year, and I got a new one (18F) 6 months ago. She's in the same college as me, a year below me and doing a different degree.

We're not close friends or anything but we get along very well. She keeps her corner of the room clean, we help each other out with chores and everything. We just don't have a lot in common and we have different friend groups. 4 months ago, she started dating one of her classmates (18M). Our hostel does allow visitors as long as they leave after 9:30 PM. I did know she was dating someone and he showed up at our room with my roommate to hang out with her. It was within hours and everything and I barely spend time at my room during the weekdays anyway so it worked out fine. He was a nice guy in general but I don't really know him all that well.

But over the past month, he's been spending a substantial amount of time in our room (which is literally 2 beds, 2 desks and a bathroom so its already pretty cramped) since their classes end at the same time . I know I said I don't spend a lot of time in my room but he's even there during most weekends, during which our college is closed and can't hang out at the library or be with my friends on campus. Sometimes I need to stay in during the weekends to study and they're always in the room talking and watching movies and making out. I tried hinting to my roommate if she could take him out sometimes. She tried arguing that its her room too and her bf lives with his parents and they don't give them privacy there like I do, but she finally relented. They started going outside more

But 2 days ago, the two of them came into the room while cutting it so close to 9:30 PM, and my roommate comes and tells me that her bf needs a place to crash for the night and he was going to sleep on the floor. I told her that was against the rules. Then he came and told me he's really tired and not feeling well and can't drive to his house which is 40 mins away. I exploded and told them that I'm not covering for them and if he stays here I'm going to report them. I'm not comfortable with him sleeping in our room and its not like he's homeless so he can go back to his own home. In the end she left to call him a taxi. When she came back she called me an asshole for letting her bf travel while being so sick.

Lately I've been feeling like I overreacted. Sure he couldn't stay over but I feel like I shouldn't have shouted because they haven't really been breaking any rules before. Also he really was sick so maybe I should have been sympathetic. But I also was feeling relieved at being able to come back to my room and not having to shrink into myself to give them space.

128,1e65day,WIBTA If I set some boundaries towards my gf friends?,"Hi. I'm 25M, my gf is 28F. We have known eachother for about 5 years, but we started dating 9 months ago. Its been a rocky relationship, ngl, but honestly, i want us to be together, and in a not so far future, marry her.

As I stated previously, its been a rocky relationship, mostly because she was jelous with several female friends. I used to be in love with one of them about 8 years ago, but i was rejected, so we only were friends from then on. I told my gf about it once we became a couple, and she didn't reacted well, and told me to cut all ties with this girl, else we would break up. I accepted.

We are gamers btw, and we use Discord to play with other people. We are in several servers, in which there are some other guys that previously wanted something with my gf, but got rejected. I didn't cared, since they all accepted it, and moved on.

Last week one of her male friends posted porn in a server we both are. He asked/tagged everyone to rate some girl's boobs, and then asked my gf directly how much does she rate that girl's body, and if her boobs are like that or anything near to it.

This got me livid. I don't know if i'm overreacting, hence, i want your opinion.  
I take that as lack of respect to my gf, our relationship and me.

The thing is, that happened last week, and I just noticed a few hours ago. She did not answer to that comment, or to anything at all. I don't even know if she saw it.

My gf joined her friends on discord a while ago, and this person was there. I don't know if she joined knowing what this person asked, but I will tell her tomorrow about it, and ask her to block this person, and to never join if he's around.

Tomorrow I will ask her to block this person, and probably also get out of all of these discord servers in which he is, along with these other male friends. All of these guys are in the same friend group, thats why I want her out of there, I don't care anymore if they won't try anything at all. 

She made me cut ties with someone I ""loved"" almost a decade ago, whom which I had a frienly relationship. Now I will ask her to cut ties with someone that asked how her boobs looked. Which honestly, does not even compare, at least to me.

129,1e65cij,AITA for changing my name quietly after telling my mom I was going to whether she came around or not?,"My name is a hot topic right now. I was given the name Jennifer at birth. But before I was born my parents had intended to call me Calla Lily, since they loved the flowers and my mom read the name Calla in some book. My mom had a change of heart right before and worried the name was too weird and too out there for a real personal. So she decided she was going to name me after one of her aunts. My middle name was also changed.

To start off with I never really liked the name Jennifer. Jenny is what a lot of people called me but meh, not a fan. My grandpa called me Jen-Jen. As a younger kid I would go by my middle name a lot.

The other issue is Aunt Jennifer. My mom and her have some real beef now and they've had that the majority of my life. It started after I was born, so was already named and everything, and my name is almost a trigger for my mom. It was also a weird experience to hear my mom rant and rave to my dad about Jennifer for hours at a time. Like I knew she wasn't talking about me but it was hard to separate. Not to mention whenever anyone called me Jen Jr or Jennifer Jr she would look so disgusted. My mom would make comments that she was eternally grateful my middle name wasn't the same as Aunt Jennifer's was.

I was 9 when my dad told me the story about Calla Lily and how it was my intended name before I was born. I asked why I didn't get that name because it was so pretty. Dad told me it was and he wanted it but mom just couldn't commit to it once I was only a week or two away from being born. He confessed that mom's issues with Aunt Jennifer meant they played it safer with my siblings names, in that they went for something more classic even though he would have liked something prettier for each of us, even the boys lol, but that he didn't want to risk more family issues becoming a strain. He acknowledged the fact my name was a sore point for reasons.

Age 9 I started to go by Calla. It took a while for people to call me that. But Calla stuck and I remember feeling like it was meant for me. My grandpa went from calling me Jen-Jen to ""little flower"" which was even sweeter than Jen-Jen honestly. My mom would always grumble, whether I went by my middle name or by Calla, that my name was Jennifer and I shouldn't confuse people.

I was 16 when I decided my name was changing. I knew my mom would be unsupportive. So I waited until six months ago, just before I turned 18 and I told my mom I was going to the court house on my 18th birthday and filing to change my name. I told her it would happen whether she came around or not. I didn't say more to her and I filed, went to court, paid for the change, which dad secretly helped me pay for, and the official change took place a month ago. So I'm not Calla. I didn't make a big deal out of it but some mail went to my parents house and my mom freaked out. She told me I needed to involve her more and should have never done it so quietly. That one talk was not enough.

131,1e655t6,AITA for correcting my daughters camp counselor?,"I \[35/M\] have a daughter \[7/F\] who has recently been attending an animal-themed(?) summer camp during the day -- she's obsessed with animals so honestly it seemed like a great fit. I usually drop her off in the morning and pick her up in the afternoon, so I am familiar with her camp counselor/group leader. Group Leader \[30(s?)/M\] seemed like a chill guy and my kid seems to like him, though today when I picked her up he asked if he could 'pull us aside to chat.'

When I asked what this was about he said that my daughter was very disrespectful to him today, and that he couldn't have her 'attitude' again. When I asked him what happened he said that they were discussing sea creatures today, and he referred to octopus as a fish, which my daughter corrected him as they are  mollusks. He tried to tell her that she was wrong, but she politely corrected him again (his own words). I told him that if she just corrected him politely then I didn't really understand the problem, but I would speak to her. He then explained that that octopus were fish, and that my daughter shouldn't be 'spreading information she doesn't understand.'

I told him that my daughter was correct, octopus *are* mollusks -- even pulled up a bunch of links from google to show him. His response was to get angry and tell me that he 'sees where my daughter gets the attitude from' and that 'she was wrong for correcting him, and that \[I\] was wrong for backing her up and usurping his authority.' I explain that correcting someone isn't usurping authority -- being corrected is sometimes just a learning experience, one that I've experienced often, and that I wasn't going to reprimand my daughter for trying to 'politely correct' him. He told me that I didn't understand how difficult his job was, and that sometimes he just needed a parents support, regardless of 'their beliefs' and stormed off.

My daughter asked if she was in trouble and I said no, of course, but I am questioning as to whether I should send her back to this camp given the behavior of her counselor; that being said, I wondered if I should have just told my daughter that sometimes it's best to let things go, even if people are wrong.

**tl;dr: Daughters counselor claims that octopus are fish (they are not), my daughter corrects him in that they are mollusks, he asks me to tell her not to correct him even if he is wrong, I tell him not unless she is being impolite/incorrect, he gets angry and storms off. I am not reprimanding my daughter. AITA?**

Thank you all for the kind words and encouragement.** ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-18,"AITA for correcting my daughters camp counselor? I \[35/M\] have a daughter \[7/F\] who has recently been attending an animal-themed(?) summer camp during the day -- she's obsessed with animals so honestly it seemed like a great fit. I usually drop her off in the morning and pick her up in the afternoon, so I am familiar with her camp counselor/group leader. Group Leader \[30(s?)/M\] seemed like a chill guy and my kid seems to like him, though today when I picked her up he asked if he could 'pull us aside to chat.'

When I asked what this was about he said that my daughter was very disrespectful to him today, and that he couldn't have her 'attitude' again. When I asked him what happened he said that they were discussing sea creatures today, and he referred to octopus as a fish, which my daughter corrected him as they are  mollusks. He tried to tell her that she was wrong, but she politely corrected him again (his own words). I told him that if she just corrected him politely then I didn't really understand the problem, but I would speak to her. He then explained that that octopus were fish, and that my daughter shouldn't be 'spreading information she doesn't understand.'

I told him that my daughter was correct, octopus *are* mollusks -- even pulled up a bunch of links from google to show him. His response was to get angry and tell me that he 'sees where my daughter gets the attitude from' and that 'she was wrong for correcting him, and that \[I\] was wrong for backing her up and usurping his authority.' I explain that correcting someone isn't usurping authority -- being corrected is sometimes just a learning experience, one that I've experienced often, and that I wasn't going to reprimand my daughter for trying to 'politely correct' him. He told me that I didn't understand how difficult his job was, and that sometimes he just needed a parents support, regardless of 'their beliefs' and stormed off.

My daughter asked if she was in trouble and I said no, of course, but I am questioning as to whether I should send her back to this camp given the behavior of her counselor; that being said, I wondered if I should have just told my daughter that sometimes it's best to let things go, even if people are wrong.

**tl;dr: Daughters counselor claims that octopus are fish (they are not), my daughter corrects him in that they are mollusks, he asks me to tell her not to correct him even if he is wrong, I tell him not unless she is being impolite/incorrect, he gets angry and storms off. I am not reprimanding my daughter. AITA?**

132,1e651zu,AITA for getting a PC when my roommates are paying for my share of utilities?,"I'm (20F) a college student leasing an apartment with four other girls in a 2bd/2bath. I‚Äôm in a triple with Amy (20F), who's my dormmate last year, and Bea (19F) who I didn‚Äôt know prior. We are mutuals with the double, Cate (20F) and Dawn (20F).

A month ago, we had our first talk on how to split the $5495 rent. Bea texted it‚Äôd be $1180 for the double and $1045 for the triple. I disagreed since the bedroom sizes are the same, and it was only slightly different from an even split by 5 ($1099 per person). From what I know it's common to divide total rent by # of rooms, and to split that amount among the people occupying each room. I proposed this so it‚Äôd come out to be roughly: double $1373, and triple $916.

In hindsight, my initial offer was a stretch, but I thought it was a standard way to split and I knew that the double can afford it. Bea said she got her numbers by calculating sqftage per person but didn't show her work, so I did it myself and ended up with: double $1201, triple $1031. I know it‚Äôs not much different from Bea's, but I feel like I should not be paying more than $1031, and if anything, should be paying less from there.

In the end the double was willing to pay $1250, which would come out to be 1k for the triple. I was fine with this and it was settled. To my surprise, Amy asked if Bea was willing to split my utilities with her. Bea agreed. I told them that it wasn‚Äôt fair, but Amy insisted. I offered to make up for it, but they said no need. I was grateful for their help because it did ease my financial stress. It was a nice offer and I accepted it when they assured me it‚Äôs fine. I thought they didn‚Äôt mind since Bea‚Äôs initial offer would have her pay more than she would now.

Last week I bought my bf's friend's pc for $600. My bf paid for it and said I can pay him back over time.

Yesterday the group told me they thought my financial situation was worse than they were led on to believe. They don‚Äôt see why I would think of buying a pc when they‚Äôre taking on my utilities. It‚Äôs no issue for me to pay my utilities and I never expected them to have to pay it. I immediately cleared up that it‚Äôs completely fine that I pay for it. They argued why I would even accept the offer in the first place if I could afford it. They said they all prioritized rent but I seemed to prioritize a want over a need.

No one has actually paid my utilities. Before any talks I also pitched in our living room couch and coffee table that I didn't ask the others to pay me back for.

At the end of our talk yesterday, Cate suggested that everyone should apologize. I apologized for being stubborn during the initial rent talks and for not realizing how my actions would affect them. I still feel unfairly criticized. I'm also hurt that Bea and Dawn never truly apologized or seemed genuinely sorry for how they treated me over the past month and during our recent conversation.",Asshole,2024-07-18,"AITA for getting a PC when my roommates are paying for my share of utilities?

134,1e64xae,AITA for not moving house with my wife?,"I (37M) am refusing to move to the house my wife (35F) is moving to.

Together 4 years and married for 2 and had a lot of financial struggles. I‚Äôm the financially responsible one, but she will argue her case and convince me to that we need to do things against my better judgement.

The biggest problem over the last year is housing. With both of us needing to work from home and the birth of our newest daughter we needed some place bigger.

My wife did all the work in looking for a property to move to because I thought it was too early to look; she hadn‚Äôt arranged the sale of her current house we lived in. 

She found a house she wanted, one that was lovely but too expensive. We had several arguments about how to proceed. I eventually caved when she at least implicitly threatened to end our relationship if I wouldn‚Äôt support her on this.

The buyer she had lined up for her house fell through so we‚Äôve ended up paying for it without even living there, we spent a year in the new house that we couldn‚Äôt afford anyway and our debts have mounted up.

We moved out of our way too expensive house at the start of the month and have had to be crashing at my mother-in-law‚Äôs flat.

The plan was to save up for a month of so, complete the sale of the original house and then find a new place to rent where we could live comfortably, get our finances in order and save. A few days ago my wife told me that she had found a place, put down a holding fee and we were going to move into it in a weeks time. The cost for this house was several hundred pounds higher than the maximum I had stated I was comfortable with, she has done it without me and she has done it prior to the original house selling.

I have said that I will not move into this house as I‚Äôve spent years being frustrated and anxious about our finances and I need our new place to be one I am comfortable with and we can recover in. She is refusing to change her plans as she thinks it is the ideal house and has already put down ¬£500 as a holding fee. We‚Äôre at a crossroads, neither of us seems willing to back down and therefore we‚Äôll de facto be splitting up unless one of us caves in the next few days.

My reasons for feeling I‚Äôm NTA:

- I should have a say in where we live and major life decisions that affect us both.
- This isn‚Äôt the first time she‚Äôs made a decision like this without even consulting me or when she knew I was against the decision.
- Whatever happens, I will spend the first several months until we‚Äôve built up some savings feeling anxious and worried.

My reasons for thinking maybe I am TA:

- She is willing to make compromises separate from the house, like getting a weekend job.
- It‚Äôs not definite that moving into the house would get us deeper into debt, just possible.
- She is the bigger earner and is willing to take on the full cost of the rent (but not bills, council tax, groceries, etc).",Everyone Sucks,2024-07-18,"AITA for not moving house with my wife? I (37M) am refusing to move to the house my wife (35F) is moving to.

135,1e64v09,AITA for wanting my allergic ex to be around her allergen for me,"My ex live in another country. Recently she came to my country and, as usually, stayed at my sister's. My sister has three cats. Ex (in her own words) is extremely allergic to cats, so she takes allergy medication and while at my sister's live in a room where no cats allowed.
 
This weekend they were throwing a party. Ex was sitting in her no cats room, door shut, and I went straight to another room to say hi to other guests. That day I had immensely important exam in the morning and then worked for eight hours, so I was really exhausted and suffering from a headache and anxious about being around Ex. So... yeah, I got very drunk very fast. 

I didn't feel well about traveling to enother room so I asked mutual friends to ask Ex to come to me. She refused. Then I scraped myself off the floor and went to a no cats room. Not gonna lie, Ex didn't straight up ignore me, but she talked only to my sister and was glued to a screen watching anime, so I felt drunkenly heartbroken and left a room very soon. Ex made no attempts to talk to me after that. I couldn't even share my success at the exam with her.

We are freshly broken up after 5 years of close friendship and 2 years of LDR, trying to stay friends or at least acquaintances. I texted Ex the next day, conveying a thought that I felt really neglected/ghosted by her at a party. But she got very defensive and called me selfish for wanting her out of no cat room, saying that I wanted her anaphylactic. We went ""You had to come to me"" - ""No, you had to"" for some time, but with no result. My sister and some other people who were present at the party sided with Ex and called me an asshole too.

I admit that I was drunk and could overreact (alcohol probably exacerbated my abandonment issues), nevertheless I feel kinda betrayed. And I'm questioning Ex's allergy now. I'm slightly allergic too and have been living with cats all my life. I imagine that she had no problem with leaving a no cat room for bathroom or kitchen, still acted like I legitimately wanted her dead when I asked her to meet me in another room. If her allergy is that bad she shouldn't stay at my sister's at all, knowing about three cats. Especially considering a fact that my sister is not the tidiest person: her apartment sometimes has this vague cat pee smell, and fur is almost inescapable even if you are vacuuming non stop (and she isn't).

While sick in bed, my oldest brother called me, accusing me of being rude for not saying hi and not informing him about the trip. I explained my situation, but he got offended. A few days later, when I felt better, he confronted me again about my ‚Äúdisrespect.‚Äù I maintained that informing our other brother was sufficient.

Then he asked me to help him move on the weekend. Initially, we agreed on 8pm Saturday. However, on Friday, he changed plans, asking me to help in the afternoon. I had prior commitments until 5pm. On Saturday, he showed up at 1pm while I was still sleeping due to insomnia. I had to leave from 2:30-4:30pm. He became angry, accusing me of laziness and started yelling at me through the door. When I finally answered, he insulted me, calling me a fucking fatass, which hurt. I swore and yelled back you fucking asshole, which I'd never done before, escalating the situation.

My parents urged reconciliation, which led me to reluctantly visit my brother's house where my dad said we‚Äôd both apologize. I apologized first, andInstead of an apology, he launched into a relentless critique of me, listing my years of disrespect and insisting I change before he would consider forgiveness.

139,1e649mr,AITA for only making one serving of noodles while my boyfriend was over?,"So this feels so stupid to me, I hate to even post about it but he is genuinely so mad, and I don't get the issue. If someone were to explain it maybe it would make more sense, I guess? I'm not above apologizing if I was in the wrong here, but I don't really get how I am, honestly.

So My boyfriend and I have been dating for around two years, though it was a slow process at first because I am not someone who opens up easily, so our relationship was effected by this. We still live separately, for several reasons, the biggest one being that I like my space, and alone time, and do not want to give it up yet, which I likely would have to, because his place is *much* smaller, though he owns it, and I only rent. However, we stay at each others places very often, and a lot of times do what my therapist friend likes to laugh and call ""parallel play"" which is a thing for children apparently, haha. But we just sit in the same room doing our own thing. (We do other things as well, but this is how we spend our down time, because it's a fun way to decompress, near someone you care about but without the pressure of conversation or eye contact.) We sometimes snack around together at this time, but more often than not it's just a ""if you want something, you know where the kitchen is"" arrangement, which suits us both fine. At least I thought it did.

Anyway! Last week we were going about doing our antisocial-social thing, being in the same room, but in our own worlds. I got hungry. I get up, and go to make a cup of ramen, before coming back. He looked confused but didn't say anything, and after a few minutes went to make his own. He didn't say anything then, but the next day he asked why I hadn't made him a cup as well. I was confused, because why would I have? Then he said that it was me being 'inconsiderate' and that I hadn't even asked if he wanted any. And asked if I didn't enjoy sharing meals with him. II replied that I didn't understand why that was a problem, because that's what we always do, and it's not like I expected him to get me chips or anything whenever he got his own.

He claimed that chips were different, and that because it was a cooked meal I should have offered. I didn't (still don't) really understand, and tried to explain my side that it wasn't really a 'cooked meal' and that it was a cup of ramen. Literally just add boiling water.

I asked their mother (Kara) before I even got them if it would be alright to extend the visit by a week so they could spend time with them. They'd be arriving the day that I was supposed to give them back.  Kara said no. I tried to compromise with Kara asking for an extra 3 or four days then and she said ""how about you return them as normal and you can make plans around whatever I do with them on my time."" I let it go after that because I try not to engage in an argument with her and honestly, it seemed like she was being an AH for lack of better words. I took what she said personally and was angry but let it go and attempted to make other plans.

This was two and a half weeks into the vacation. My mom tried to call Kara that weekend and she never picked up. 

The day before Kara was going to pick the girls up she asked if my family was still coming and I told her they aren't because she had said no about four or five times and ignored my mother when she asked.

I said from my perspective its kind of impossible to plan around her if she didn't have any solid plans to give me to work around, that she had already said no a total of 5 times already, that her ""how about you"" comment was vague and gaslighty in an after-the-fact way now that she's willing to work with me the day before the girls are supposed to come back, and how she had shot both of the kids down when they asked about it.

145,1e63dt6,AITA for making my brother in law clean the bathroom?,"This might be a long post. So, I apologize. Me (28 F) and my husband (37 M) have been living together since the pandemic. From the early stages of our relationship, I noticed my husband's family is very relying on him, and they are even abusive. They always expect him to solve their problems, especially if that involves money. So it wasn't really a surprise that we were expected to have my BIL staying with us after he (25 M) got kicked out of his place. Now, I really don't want to be rude but he is like a child. He has just finished high school, he has no job (and when he is working he doesn't last too long at his jobs), and he has the idea that he's going to be discovered by a star agent or something. He is talented, he sings and is into acting, but he is not consistent and is not really pursuing an acting career. Back to my problem, me and my husband had argues about BIL staying with us. I was treated as a maid when he last visited, and I was not up for it again. My husband and my mother in law both told me I was in charge and he was going to obey me. Which I disagreed completely. I am not his mother, and he isn't a baby. He knows when the place needs tidying up and is capable of doing so. Or so I thought, because when he showed up I was shocked to see that he doesn't take care of himself at all. After a week of not saying anything, I finally had it. And right when I finished doing my part of the chores I told him he had to clean his bathroom, since they have to be clean once a week and that's the time he had spent with us. He said yes and proceeded to follow all the instructions I gave him, because he told me he didn't know how to do it. I thanked him and my husband bought dinner for the 3 of us, as a way to congratulate him for a job well done. I thought this was fine, but about 2 or 3 days after he just announced he was leaving. He claimed one of his friends invited him to be their roommate and BIL had already paid rent. My husband was shocked and a little heartbroken, he treats his brother like a son. So husband told BIL he'd feel better if he could drive him to his new place, so to be certain he is safe. We drove him, and realized BIL lied. We took him with a different friend and a different place that he had told us before. And this place wasn't safe, and was too far away from us and the new job BIL had allegedly got recently. But BIL insisted he had to stay there now. This happened on a Tuesday, we got back home at midnight and we have to wake up at 5am to get to our jobs. BIL was well aware of this. I know he is not a reasonable person, but I can't shake the feeling that this rushed decision had to do with me being hard on him by asking him to clean. I wasn't happy with BIL living with us and wanted him to move out the right way. After getting a stable job and saving up enough money, of course. I didn't ask him to clean so he would leave, and I did it nicely. And even though he said no, I could tell my husband was sad his bro left in those conditions.

From the early stages of our relationship, I noticed my husband's family is very relying on him, and they are even abusive. They always expect him to solve their problems, especially if that involves money. So it wasn't really a surprise that we were expected to have my BIL staying with us after he (25 M) got kicked out of his place. Now, I really don't want to be rude but he is like a child. He has just finished high school, he has no job (and when he is working he doesn't last too long at his jobs), and he has the idea that he's going to be discovered by a star agent or something. He is talented, he sings and is into acting, but he is not consistent and is not really pursuing an acting career. Back to my problem, me and my husband had argues about BIL staying with us. I was treated as a maid when he last visited, and I was not up for it again. My husband and my mother in law both told me I was in charge and he was going to obey me. Which I disagreed completely. I am not his mother, and he isn't a baby. He knows when the place needs tidying up and is capable of doing so. Or so I thought, because when he showed up I was shocked to see that he doesn't take care of himself at all. After a week of not saying anything, I finally had it. And right when I finished doing my part of the chores I told him he had to clean his bathroom, since they have to be clean once a week and that's the time he had spent with us. He said yes and proceeded to follow all the instructions I gave him, because he told me he didn't know how to do it. I thanked him and my husband bought dinner for the 3 of us, as a way to congratulate him for a job well done. I thought this was fine, but about 2 or 3 days after he just announced he was leaving. He claimed one of his friends invited him to be their roommate and BIL had already paid rent. My husband was shocked and a little heartbroken, he treats his brother like a son. So husband told BIL he'd feel better if he could drive him to his new place, so to be certain he is safe. We drove him, and realized BIL lied. We took him with a different friend and a different place that he had told us before. And this place wasn't safe, and was too far away from us and the new job BIL had allegedly got recently. But BIL insisted he had to stay there now. This happened on a Tuesday, we got back home at midnight and we have to wake up at 5am to get to our jobs. BIL was well aware of this. I know he is not a reasonable person, but I can't shake the feeling that this rushed decision had to do with me being hard on him by asking him to clean. I wasn't happy with BIL living with us and wanted him to move out the right way. After getting a stable job and saving up enough money, of course. I didn't ask him to clean so he would leave, and I did it nicely. And even though he said no, I could tell my husband was sad his bro left in those conditions. So, AITA?",0.0,0.05367860943078995,0,1

147,1e62vox,AITA? friend screenshotted my personal noted and denied it. i dropped out of a vacation our group had planned. both m20.,"Hey guys, my high school friends and I met up this summer break when we all returned to our home city. We decided to hold a staycation kind of event at a friend's place as his parents were out of town. we planned on getting drunk and smoking weed the whole night. Everything was going fine until the next morning when I woke up and noticed that there were screenshots of my notes on my phone. this was scary to me as my phone notes are where I usually vent out all the depressing and messed up thoughts I had throughout the past few years of my life. depression, breakup, and quite literally every intrusive thought I ever had were all in there.

I had not shown it to anyone before and that was for a reason. I asked everyone and at that time everyone denied ever doing it. I then found out later that one of them did it early in the morning. so I decided to block him and not talk to him again. this is the second time he has done something of this nature and the first time I forgave him. He recorded a voice call between me and my then-girlfriend breaking up. for some reason I forgave him and we were strong friends after that incident. but after he did this I don't know if I can look over it twice.

we were a group of four and had planned a vacation for the next month. I left the vacation group chat as I just did not want to travel with that guy again. now here is where things get fucked up. everyone in the group gets mad at me because I left the group and they make me seem like a villain because I ""ruined the trip"". they spam called me to convince me to come to the vacation but ignore that one guy. I just didn't know what to do and held my ground saying I didn't feel safe around him and that I won't be traveling near him. I even told them to go on their own too. it's almost somewhat like what he did doesn't even matter and they just care about this stupid vacation.

today he admitted to doing it and was making excuses like ""I was drunk"", ""I thought it was my phone"" and the worst of all ""I had no malintent"".

149,1e62jsj,AITA for not giving my friend a band's guitar pick?,"To start this off, this happened months ago and there is no grudge over this (from what I know of), I just want to see other people's opinions.

My (16F) friend (15F) went to a rock Concert (Avatar, 10/10 concert) because my mother had gotten her into the band. If it matters any, my mother had already seen the band twice before this and she played me the songs for a long time before introducing my friend, we'll call her D, to the band.

Now I'm not particularly into rock/metal music (small edit: I do listen to it just not as my main genre. And to note I have many of this band's songs memorized from the amount I've heard of it, not every song but a good few), I've been to mainly rock concerts as my mother offers me tickets (who am I to say no) but my best friend loves it and this band. My mother bought her ticket as well.

We were right at the railing in the front of the pit, we actually got personal conversations with some of the opening band members because we were at the exit to go backstage.
Skip to the end of the concert, one of the staff/security guards walked up to me and handed me a guitar pick, I didn't ask and had not seen that staff member at all.
My friend had went to grab the pick but the staff member avoided her reach and handed it to me.

D actively started begging me for it, over and over, I declined giving it to her. It was my first guitar pick (it would've been her first), note I've always wanted to get a guitar pick, and it was handed to me. She continued to beg and plead for it and told me it wasn't my band anyway.
I feel I could be an asshole for the fact I still kept it and she seemed upset the rest of the time (aka the way home, though she may have been tired as she slept alot of it).

Am I the asshole for not giving it to her and not caring that she had not gotten a guitar pick like I did?

so then after a bit of me talking to my sister. my sister said, ‚Äúwell some of the ways that i feel better to get friends is going to church, my youth group, or when i see someone in the store that i think would be a cool friend.‚Äù now obviously, with my social anxiety simply going up to someone isn‚Äôt super easy. and i am not religious in any means at the moment so she told me that she‚Äôs knows that won‚Äôt work for me. i told her, ‚Äúi know that, but a lot of the kids my age aren‚Äôt the most ‚Äòfunny‚Äô people or the coolest people to talk to.‚Äù she said she knew that and that she‚Äôd try to help me come up with ideas to make friends. although when i had begun telling her that i know it isn‚Äôt normal for me at this age to feel this way for so long she said, ‚Äúwell you need to push yourself you don‚Äôt try to push yourself.‚Äù and it makes me a bit upset when people tell me i don‚Äôt try. because i have been trying. to me it sounded like someone who doesn‚Äôt have depression or anything telling me to just get rid of it and try to do something to make friends. i told her, ‚Äúyes but [her name] that‚Äôs hard for me to do, it may not be for you but it is for me.‚Äù and she got a bit frustrated and said, ‚Äúi can‚Äôt talk about this anymore right now. let me go wash my face, goodnight i love you.‚Äù and then left my bedroom. 


my older sister is a very ‚Äògirl‚Äô type of girl if that makes any sense? she can talk to people and is pretty confident and stuff. i am not that way at all and i panic when i have to just text people and i think i said something wrong. it does feel as if she always has to make conversations about me and my mental health problems about her and how she use to struggle and that jesus helped her a lot.

so then after a bit of me talking to my sister. my sister said, ‚Äúwell some of the ways that i feel better to get friends is going to church, my youth group, or when i see someone in the store that i think would be a cool friend.‚Äù now obviously, with my social anxiety simply going up to someone isn‚Äôt super easy. and i am not religious in any means at the moment so she told me that she‚Äôs knows that won‚Äôt work for me. i told her, ‚Äúi know that, but a lot of the kids my age aren‚Äôt the most ‚Äòfunny‚Äô people or the coolest people to talk to.‚Äù she said she knew that and that she‚Äôd try to help me come up with ideas to make friends. although when i had begun telling her that i know it isn‚Äôt normal for me at this age to feel this way for so long she said, ‚Äúwell you need to push yourself you don‚Äôt try to push yourself.‚Äù and it makes me a bit upset when people tell me i don‚Äôt try. because i have been trying. to me it sounded like someone who doesn‚Äôt have depression or anything telling me to just get rid of it and try to do something to make friends. i told her, ‚Äúyes but [her name] that‚Äôs hard for me to do, it may not be for you but it is for me.‚Äù and she got a bit frustrated and said, ‚Äúi can‚Äôt talk about this anymore right now. let me go wash my face, goodnight i love you.‚Äù and then left my bedroom.

My sister's started a Facebook message group. So we can all stay updated on what's going on each other's lives. I've been sick since August 2023. I had non-stop bleeding, for months off and on. Then I had a ureter stent put in due to kidney stones and about 4 blood transfusions due to adenomyosis.  To say I've been sick was an understatement.  I read the post about my niece getting a car and I meant to like it but my brain was in such a fog or I'd just be so out of it I'd forget.  The same day I  had just had a biopsy to find out what was going on.  So I go to the group and say,"" I'm sorry I've been so sick "" she starts removing her children from the group and then herself.  My youngest sister texted me saying that my middle sister left the group due to me not acknowledging her child's successes. So my youngest sister created a group for us to talk it out. It ended up being her yelling at me. And saying how I hurt my niece by not saying congrat on getting her car or driver's license.  I tried to explain it wasn't intentional and that I didn't mean to hurt anyone. She wouldn't listen so I left that group.  She said that i was making excuses and that she didnt believe I didnt do it on purpose. I texted my niece apologizing for hurting her feelings telling her that I loved her. Not making any excuses for myself. She ignored it.

2 weeks later I had a hysterectomy due to hemorrhaging in May.  I dont know if its the case but i think they might be upset that I didnt make her graduation but I was on bed rest due to the hysterectomy. Since then I've not heard from them, none of them checked on me or visited. When my eldest sister came to town Sunday we met at a Cafe and they sat at separate tables, then they went to my great nephews bday party. I wasn't invited.

AITA? I've apologized to my niece I don't know what else to do. I've always been the easy going sister, they know that  ignoring me gets to me. They've grouped up like this since we were children. I thought those days were over. I'm here because I'm hoping that there's something that I actually did that I can fix.

some reasons she might be angry:

\* Not giving my niece the attention she needs

\* sister not feeling supported by me, she's been a single parent so this is a big accomplishment for her too.  So it might look like I'm failing to acknowledge her successful parenting

\*it could seem like jealousy because my daughter isn't getting her license until next year( my daughter wanted to wait) so that could be the reason they think I ignored my niece .  it's not ( my brain is all over the place)  but they might see it differently.

My boyfriend is a very hardworking, resilient individual who has endured a lot. His mother was a drug addict his entire life and has bounced back between prison, rehabs, and home. His childhood was severely damaged due to her inconsistency, along with scarring behavior he witnessed when she was under the influence.

After getting caught and sent to rehab for the 9th time in his life, she has been clean and trying to mend things with my boyfriend. My boyfriend wants nothing to do with her at the moment. I support him 100%. He doesn't need to get his hopes up again only for her to fail him again.

She has constantly reached out despite him asking for time and space. Her messages are very unhealthy, often talking about how she's being so strong and this recovery process is about her, not him, but at the same time him ignoring her is making it harder and harder for her to stay clean. It is a lot of sick manipulation like that sprinkled in, but you get the just. 

Recently she messaged me, requesting  I encourage him to talk to her. I told her right away I was not getting involved like that, I respect his choice and if she cares about him at all, she'll step back, focus on her recovery and let him have the privilege of recovering after what has happened. She didn't like that. She said she was trying, but not one gives her a chance due to her being a filthy addict. So I told her I didn't think she was a filthy addict, I just think she's a horrible and selfish person who is wasting all our time with her pity party instead of allowing her son the time he deserves.

I got a bunch of friends of her now sending me nasty messages. Most tell me I have no idea how addiction is, which is true, I don't.

Trouble is, my husband‚Äôs flight got delayed almost 3hrs and we would have gotten back around 3am. I did not take off work (I work remotely) and had a few meetings to take that day in addition to several tasks I needed to do for wedding preparation.

I suggested that my husband get a hotel when he landed and take a train from the airport to where my sister lives.

I understand he really wanted to meetup with his friends that day who would have been difficult to reschedule with, but I was already exhausted from getting in late the night before and did not feel up to driving that late at night, working the next day and doing wedding prep.

159,1e61azg,AITA ie AWTA neighbors?,"Nearly everyone in our neighborhood has a pool. We and our next door neighbor to our right have one, and we both have a ton of trees, bushes and flowering plants. This means we have to do a lot of pool maintenance, but we both know that‚Äôs just part of having both a pool and plenty of shade. I point out this fact about our neighbor to show that we are not the only ones who have a pool and actual vegetation. A lot of pool owners in the area have almost no trees, though, except 1-2 palm trees, which I find ugly and incongruous among the native oaks and pines. We also live 3 doors down from the entrance into a large park with running trails, which has a lot of trees and vines.

Last fall, the neighbor who lives behind us and to our left (so we share the back left corner of the fence with them)  knocked on our door. ‚ÄúJane‚Äù said her pool vac was getting clogged with leaves and asked if we could ‚Äúdo something‚Äù about our oaks in the backyard. I was horrified at the thought of our trees encroaching on a neighbor and said we‚Äôd address it immediately. She said something like, ‚Äúthank you, bc you know, we don‚Äôt have any trees.‚Äù I said ok. 

We saw one of our trees did have some high branches bending over the fence line into the neighbors DIRECTLY behind us, but NOT over HER yard, which is diagonal/catty corner to us. We hired someone to trim those back. 

But it wasn‚Äôt enough. Jane came back earlier this summer and confronted my husband. She asked him again to ‚Äúdo something about the leaves,‚Äù and he said our trees were not even close to encroaching over her property. She insisted we ‚ÄúDO SOMETHING,‚Äù and repeated again that she hasno trees. This is true, her backyard has a small patch of grass, and the rest is a concrete deck around her pool. He told me it was obvious she felt this is how she wanted our yard to be.  She said OUR leaves are clogging her pool vac/pump and she‚Äôs already had to replace it twice. But the trees are in OUR actual yard, and our own leaves have never caused us to have to replace OUR vac, so I don‚Äôt see how they have managed to crowd her pool more than our own? Also, there are oaks all over our neighborhood and along the aforementioned trails, so how could she even know they are our leaves?

A few days later, ‚ÄúJill,‚Äù our next door neighbor directly to our left (so Jane lives directly behind her) told us that Jane had also asked her to remove a Crepe Myrtle, even after Jill had it trimmed back. She had also asked Jill for my number so she could text me photos of her pool vac. I found this annoying, bordering on harassment. 

The tree guy said trimming the oaks down would probably kill them, which we are unwilling to do. 

So we‚Äôve decided to just ignore her. AWTAs for not complying with her wishes for a world bare of trees so her pool vac can work in peace? I want to be a good neighbor but I feel like this is asking too much?

Last fall, the neighbor who lives behind us and to our left (so we share the back left corner of the fence with them)  knocked on our door. ‚ÄúJane‚Äù said her pool vac was getting clogged with leaves and asked if we could ‚Äúdo something‚Äù about our oaks in the backyard. I was horrified at the thought of our trees encroaching on a neighbor and said we‚Äôd address it immediately. She said something like, ‚Äúthank you, bc you know, we don‚Äôt have any trees.‚Äù I said ok. 

We saw one of our trees did have some high branches bending over the fence line into the neighbors DIRECTLY behind us, but NOT over HER yard, which is diagonal/catty corner to us. We hired someone to trim those back. 

But it wasn‚Äôt enough. Jane came back earlier this summer and confronted my husband. She asked him again to ‚Äúdo something about the leaves,‚Äù and he said our trees were not even close to encroaching over her property. She insisted we ‚ÄúDO SOMETHING,‚Äù and repeated again that she hasno trees. This is true, her backyard has a small patch of grass, and the rest is a concrete deck around her pool. He told me it was obvious she felt this is how she wanted our yard to be.  She said OUR leaves are clogging her pool vac/pump and she‚Äôs already had to replace it twice. But the trees are in OUR actual yard, and our own leaves have never caused us to have to replace OUR vac, so I don‚Äôt see how they have managed to crowd her pool more than our own? Also, there are oaks all over our neighborhood and along the aforementioned trails, so how could she even know they are our leaves?

A few days later, ‚ÄúJill,‚Äù our next door neighbor directly to our left (so Jane lives directly behind her) told us that Jane had also asked her to remove a Crepe Myrtle, even after Jill had it trimmed back. She had also asked Jill for my number so she could text me photos of her pool vac. I found this annoying, bordering on harassment. 

The tree guy said trimming the oaks down would probably kill them, which we are unwilling to do. 

So we‚Äôve decided to just ignore her. AWTAs for not complying with her wishes for a world bare of trees so her pool vac can work in peace? I want to be a good neighbor but I feel like this is asking too much?

160,1e61auj,WIBTA if I told my coworkers the real reason why a female coworker hates me?,"
Hi to give a little context:

I have been on this job for over 9 months now. I believe I have made a good relationship with my coworkers (some more than others as normal) but there is just this one that just seems to be out there to get me and waiting for me to trip and eat the dirt on the floor. Let‚Äôs call this woman A.

Now, I believe I know where the problems comes from.  When I very first started this job there was this male coworker (let‚Äôs call him M) who was kind of trying to get on with me. Now the signs where as clear as they can get. They started with an almost kiss on a night-out with the other people at our job in his house. I say almost kiss vaciar the only thing that stop us was the drunk out person dead-sleeping less than 1 feet near us. Then they continued with an almost non stop talkin while we were at our jobs and long conversations over text with not so subtle clues here and there. It all culminated when he asked me to go out (just the two of us) and I said yes.

Long story short, he cancelled on me. Then came the very clear change of attitude towards me. Then came the very obvious flirting with A. So obvious that I was not the only one who saw. Now, I‚Äôm an not the kind of person who goes behind begging for attention from someone who does not want to give the attention back to me so I just let it rest (even though I did reciprocated the flirting). 

Now everyone (me included) thinks they are dating. They have not said anything about it but it‚Äôs a voiced secret between us. I have tried to make it seem like the whole ordeal is just another Tuesday for me. I‚Äôm still making normal conversation with M and I have not tell a whisper about my history with with M to no one. The problem comes whenever I interact with A.

This woman hates me. She is disrespectful towards me in front of our other coworker AND bosses. She does not talk to me with the same level of normalcy than with the other people. Every time she sees me is like I‚Äôm being a sore in her royal ass. It‚Äôs just her mannerism and the way she talks as if I were  a child or a person with a mental discapacity. Other people have noticed. They think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm new so I don‚Äôt have a close enough relationship with A. I know the real reason. 

I hate this stale mate match. I‚Äôm thinking of just spilling the beans. To show everyone that she is acting like a child for a man that not even really liked me that much in the first place. But at the same time, I‚Äôm crossing privacy boundaries if I do so.

For context, my wife and I had a baby in October. Since probably month 3 I‚Äôve taken over every/all overnights exclusively.

She‚Äôs not speaking to me and to be fair I‚Äôm not really speaking to her, but I feel like she‚Äôs being really unreasonable about this. Am I wrong here? For more context she also got mad at me while I was pregnant for waking her up with the dogs while we were camping.

168,1e60amr,WIBTA If I Confronted A Coworker Who‚Äôs About To Make A Big Mistake?,"Brooke (21F)ended a 5+ year relationship a little over a month ago. Basically, the ex was a deadbeat, but she said she doesn‚Äôt love him anymore. Shortly after that, she started an online dating profile, spoke to some guys, and then became smitten with one of them right away. Like call off work b/c she wants to be with him all the time smitten.

Craig told her he was 23 at first, but he ended up being 25. He‚Äôs got 2 children by different women who live out of state. He only talks to one of them. When she first met him, he had 2 jobs serving, but now he‚Äôs only got 1. He‚Äôs currently living with friends, but he‚Äôs not on their lease. He‚Äôs moving out in 2 days to move in with Brooke. She‚Äôs signing the lease, but he‚Äôs not gonna be on it.

As I mentioned, she‚Äôs called off a couple times for him because she‚Äôs sick, she says, but it‚Äôs later revealed that she was actually just hungover. Once a couple weeks ago, she called off because her grandmother who lives an hour away wasn‚Äôt doing well. Brooke was fine the next day, and she let slip that she spent the day prior with Craig. A couple days  after that, she wanted to leave work early because grandma wasn‚Äôt doing well again or something. That didn‚Äôt happen, and it, so far, hasn‚Äôt come up again. She‚Äôs young, I know, but this is new behavior in the year I‚Äôve known her.

Her mom met Craig at a gathering last weekend. A day after that, Brooke told her mom that she and Craig are moving in together even though she knew it was gonna happen before the gathering. Her mom wasn‚Äôt happy and told her so. Her dad also told her he wasn‚Äôt happy because he‚Äôs never met the guy (do you meet family after knowing each other a month but he‚Äôs only decided to be dating 2 weeks ago?). Even her ex‚Äôs mother told her it‚Äôs not a good idea. Her friend told her it wasn‚Äôt a good idea. At least one coworker has told her it‚Äôs not a good idea. I‚Äôm fairly certain not all of these people know that he‚Äôs not gonna be on the lease. Per Brooke, she doesn‚Äôt take advice from other people.

I‚Äôve known his name for a few weeks, but I finally googled it today. 2 years ago, he was arrested for driving while intoxicated. Brooke hasn‚Äôt really told me too many details about him, but that‚Äôs something she wouldn‚Äôt‚Äôve told me, probably. He still goes out drinking, but the state where he got the DWI seems pretty lenient on the license suspension.

So, would I be the asshole if I confront her about this last detail? I haven‚Äôt told her how I felt overall, and I would do it semi-tactfully. But I work with her every day when she shows up, and we‚Äôre in the same office, and we do have to talk as part of our job.

169,1e5zz61,AITA for expecting boyfriend to make me dinner after work?,"My boyfriend has been unemployed for just over a year and a half and I work as a nurse at a hospital. We don‚Äôt live together, but have been together for around 7 years. Normally when I get home from a shift and don‚Äôt have work the next day, I tend to go to his house after I shower and what not. 

I work three 12 and a half hour shifts a week. My work days tend to go way over 13 hours. Generally I‚Äôll wake up around 4:15am, go to the gym, and leave my house by 5:30am to get to work by 7am. Once I get out, I don‚Äôt get home till around 9pm. At the start of each week I‚Äôll meal prep my breakfast and lunches. However, I don‚Äôt ever really meal prep dinner. Usually I‚Äôll have a protein shake for dinner when I‚Äôm working back to back shifts. However, when I don‚Äôt have work the following day I try to make myself dinner rather than a shake. 

I‚Äôve spoken to my boyfriend plenty of times about how it would be nice if he could cook dinner for me every now and then and have it ready by the time I get to his house after work. I don‚Äôt expect this all the time, but since he‚Äôs not working I don‚Äôt feel too bad asking him to go out of his way. Although he‚Äôs done it a handful of times, I‚Äôm frustrated that it‚Äôs usually because we get into an argument about how it‚Äôs never done. 

Over the weekend I asked if he would cook dinner for me on Wednesday night (tonight) since I don‚Äôt work tomorrow and I was supposed to go to his place after work. He said he would and I sent him a recipe that I knew he had all the ingredients for. 

On my way home from work today I gave him a call to ask how he was doing and see if he had remembered to cook dinner. He immediately said no and explained that he thought I meant tomorrow night. I got even more frustrated at that point because we spoke about it and he was aware of my work schedule this week. He knows I work Friday, and won‚Äôt be at his house, so why would he assume I meant Thursday night? 

I explained to him that I was frustrated. I mean, what did you do all day, other than go to the gym and stay home, that you couldn‚Äôt find any time to make me dinner? Rather than argue about it, I told him I was just going to stay back at my place tonight. 

I‚Äôm just frustrated right now. It‚Äôs hard for me to not get angry at small things like this. I work in a very challenging ICU. Sometimes I‚Äôm both exhausted and slightly down after work depending on the day. I‚Äôm very open with my boyfriend. 

Now I feel bad. Am I crazy for that? Maybe it‚Äôs because he doesn‚Äôt understand the physical and mental stress my job puts on me. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm extremely frustrated that he isn‚Äôt currently working and doesn‚Äôt have the same level of responsibility as I do. Or maybe it‚Äôs a combination of both?

170,1e5zy4h,AITA for applying for an award I knew my boyfriend wanted and then winning?,"I (21f) have been dating my boyfriend (21m) for several months now. We met because we're in the same program in university. We both chose to study this major because we wanted to pursue a career in an industry that is small and difficult to break into. Though we share a lot of the same interests, he tends to drift towards a specific specialization while I've taken more of a jack-of-all-trades approach.

About two months ago I was applying for university awards when I noticed two of them fit his specialization. I encouraged him to apply but let him know that I was also planning on submitting my work for consideration. He was interested in the award but thought it might be a waste of his time because he is white, heterosexual and cisgender. He thinks that the university prefers to give out awards to students who come from marginalized groups because ""the diversity looks better for the school instead of giving awards to people who deserve them"". I've tried to tell him that talented people win the awards regardless of their background but he thinks if the awards weren't rigged he would be receiving them instead of some of our classmates.

In the end, he decided to apply for the award which had the highest monetary value even though I said he should apply for both to improve his chances. After that, he started telling me that I shouldn't apply for the award anymore because it would just take up time I could spend on other activities. I applied for the award without explicitly telling him and thought if I somehow won, I would figure out how to tell him in the moment.

Well, last week I won the award. Obviously I'm extremely excited and just in disbelief that they chose my body of work over all the other submissions. I haven't told my boyfriend yet because I'm worried he'll get angry at me for winning or even applying at all. I don't want him to think I didn't deserve it just because I'm a woman that ""checks more diversity boxes"" but I also can't hide it from him forever. How do I have this conversation with him? Am I the asshole for even applying for an award in his specialty? Should I give him part of the monetary prize?

BONUS CONTEXT - He held a job for about four months that I later held for a little over a year. Despite the fact that I held the position longer, he regularly tells me that it isn't comparable because it was ""harder"" when he was working than when I was. There are other instances where we've worked very similar jobs but he belittles my work because it wasn't as ""legitimate"" as his. I think he is incredibly talented and could have a remarkable career but whenever I bring up his ego or behaviour he doesn‚Äôt understand how it‚Äôs demeaning because it‚Äôs just ‚Äúfactual‚Äù.

173,1e5zkav,"AITA for telling my brother (22M) we are done financially supporting (enabling) him, and he needs to get off his a**?","My brother moved for uni. We lived together for a year and split the rent ($500 ea) but now hes living on his own in the 2 bed for a bit less than a year. He worked a minimum wage job for only 12 hours a week and held it for a year (quit to come home for summer) He keeps complaining how is bank account is sinking each month and how he needs us to financially help him.

He says he shouldn't need to work and when he's done with his degree in 4 more years and makes 60k a year he will be financially free and will have never taken out student loans (he got financial aid for first 4 years and will need less than 40k total for the last 2 years)

Even though he's using our parents car, it is big and spends a lot of gas. I convinced my mother to buy him a $10k 50 mpg car so he uber or uber-eats so he can easily be self-sufficient but he still feels entitled to being given more money so he at least breaks even every month until he graduates in 4 years and can get a ""real job"".

He delivered 10-20h total this summer, mostly us doing it together and giving him all the money we made so I encourage him to work and want to make money. We did the math, including the 40k he needs in 2-4 years he needs $68 a day average for food (fast food since food stamps don't cover them), bills, and rent. I am paying 70 a month for his internet, mom paying for his car insurance

How he can make it much cheaper:  
-Downgrade to 1 bedroom  
-Inform electric company he is low income so they change is bill from $100-150 to $30  
-learn to cook so food cost will be $0

He is too lazy to do anything and has showed me his phone which has over 12+ hours of tiktok a day. He is always on his phone when eating, sleeping, even playing Xbox. He does nothing productive, lucky if he showers once a week, and doesn't take care of himself yet keeps complaining and saying how he wish he can just skip this boring miserable phase of life and skip to 30 where he has a job (that he has 0 passion for), house and family bc thats where ""the game really starts"" When school starts he will be going there \~15 hours a week, 3-4 days a week.

It's pathetic if he can't even get 40-hour work week done (including school, work, studying, driving to and from school, homework). He can't just sit on fucking tiktok all day, complain about no motivation or ambition (no shit when you used all your dopamine on tiktok and junk food and never exercise) and feel entitled to us having to help him the whole way there.

I'm scared hel never know what work ethic is and live the rest of his life unfulfilled and carry regret the rest of his life as to why he couldn't be anything more. If he actually enjoyed the life he has now it would be a different story but he HATES it. I feel things have to get worse for him so the pain of changing is less than the pain of staying the same",Not the A-hole,2024-07-18,"AITA for telling my brother (22M) we are done financially supporting (enabling) him, and he needs to get off his a**? My brother moved for uni. We lived together for a year and split the rent ($500 ea) but now hes living on his own in the 2 bed for a bit less than a year. He worked a minimum wage job for only 12 hours a week and held it for a year (quit to come home for summer) He keeps complaining how is bank account is sinking each month and how he needs us to financially help him.

He says he shouldn't need to work and when he's done with his degree in 4 more years and makes 60k a year he will be financially free and will have never taken out student loans (he got financial aid for first 4 years and will need less than 40k total for the last 2 years)

Even though he's using our parents car, it is big and spends a lot of gas. I convinced my mother to buy him a $10k 50 mpg car so he uber or uber-eats so he can easily be self-sufficient but he still feels entitled to being given more money so he at least breaks even every month until he graduates in 4 years and can get a ""real job"".

He delivered 10-20h total this summer, mostly us doing it together and giving him all the money we made so I encourage him to work and want to make money. We did the math, including the 40k he needs in 2-4 years he needs $68 a day average for food (fast food since food stamps don't cover them), bills, and rent. I am paying 70 a month for his internet, mom paying for his car insurance

How he can make it much cheaper:  
-Downgrade to 1 bedroom  
-Inform electric company he is low income so they change is bill from $100-150 to $30

174,1e5zd48,AITA for telling my friend that I dont want to hear about her crush anymore?,"For starters me (16f) and my friend Jen (15f) are super close. Shes over at my house every day hanging out and we get along super well. We often get into a lot of mini-arguments that just wash over the next day and I think thats what this is but Im not sure. I try to communicate well, but when I ask her what happened so I dont do it next time, she pushes me away.



My friend Jen has a crush on a boy, Drew, and has had a crush on him since the first day of school. She got his number close to the end of school and I was super happy for her. They were talking for a bit and then out of the blue, he ghosted her. So they just moved their separate ways. After a bit, I was having a sleepover with Jen and another friend and Jen texted Drew bc we all thought it would be funny. Jen sent a joke and made an impression that she thought Drew would like and they started talking again, I was happy for her. So Jen and Drew met up and they hit it off. From the way Jen was telling me, they got along well. Same humor, same style, and same music they like. They were pretty much a perfect fit.



Later on, Drew started becoming dry and sending less messages and now using his humor with her. (I have to bring up, Jen is super insecure about her body. When my friend and I try to help her, she just blows us off.) Because Drew wouldnt message her, she would bring up the fact she thinks that Drew doesnt like her for her body or her face. My friend and I would tell her that Drew wouldnt hang out with her if he didnt like the way she looked (as shallow as that sounds, teenage boys act like that). Almost everyday she would bring up the fact that she thought Drew didnt like her. And as usual, my friend and I would comfort her. My friend went to the military, so shes not allowed her phone, and I have to comfort Jen myself (one thing about me, Im not very good at that, so I would just say what I think my friend would say).



A couple days later, Drew ghosted her again and almost everyday she would talk about how she thought Drew thought she was ugly and unfunny. I try my best to comfort her again, like usual, and she just blows me off again.



Shes trying to get into song making and she was just going to make a song for fun, but then she texted me saying, ""what if I make the song about Drew?"" I wanted to give my honest answer saying that it wouldnt be a good idea given that he ghosted her and that shes trying to move on. I said it would make her feelings for Drew worse. I told her shes allowed to do whatever she wants and that I was just warning her. She told me she was going to make the song about Drew anyway. Im convinced shes going to get her feelings hurt and make the feelings that she has for him worse, so I told her that and I told her that I didnt want to hear about him anymore. Im tired of hearing about Drew and trying to help, but Jen will just not take my advice or try to listen to me.



So am I the asshole?

175,1e5z9i3,AITA for admitting I have a favorite sibling?,"I (F14) had my girlfriend over a few days ago and we were hanging out in the backyard because I share a room with my little sister (F10) and obviously we don't want her around listening to everything we're saying 1) because she's 10 and she'll be traumatized 2) it's our business alone and 3) she has a tendency to snitch when she finds out a secret. Okay, so my mom knows about my girlfriend and she's very, very supportive, but she oversteps a lot of the time and gets really overprotective. 

While we were talking, I was telling her about my siblings all of which are younger than me (almost 11M, 10F, 2F and 2F)(I'll be 15 in August) and we were laughing because I said ""I'd sell my little brother to Satan any day"" and then I followed up, ""just kidding, I do love him and he's actually my favorite sibling."" Turns out my sister (yeah, the one I share a room with) was outside setting up the sprinklers for the little kids and heard what I said. She started crying and I told her I was kidding trying to laugh it off to make her believe I was joking. She didn't believe me and ran inside and a minute later my mom comes out and asked me if I really favor my brother over my sister. I admitted that yeah, I do and she told me it was a terrible thing to say around her. Now I genuinely didn't know my sister was outside and I told her this, but she just snapped ""maybe you should be more aware of your surroundings then."" Next I said that I shouldn't have to be hypervigilant in my own home and I can say what I think. My mom went on to say ""yes, but your sister feels betrayed and is crying and now might be bitter with your brother."" 

I figured I should apologize for real but also not let my sister know it's true, so after my mom got done lecturing me I went in and told my sister ""I'm sorry for joking around too harshly, I don't actually love him more than you, I love everyone the same"" and I said I'd been making fun of my brother right before I'd made the comment so I felt the need to say something nice about him after. My sister said ""thanks, but know mom's still mad at you and will ground you once that person leaves for being mean about me."" I said whatever and went back outside. My mom and father are still mad at me but my sister's completely forgotten (it seems) by now. I'm confused. This is all really dumb.
