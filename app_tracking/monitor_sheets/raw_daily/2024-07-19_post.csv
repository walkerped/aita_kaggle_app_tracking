0,1e6qwtm,WIBTA For taking my younger BIL to Disneyland Paris?,"For pretext, my wife has 3 younger siblings. L (f25, but not important in this scenario), Lena (13f), and Morgan (11m).

Lena was unfortunately born with an extensive list of medical issues, resulting in her spending the majority of her early childhood battling a rare form of brain cancer. She is currently in the clear, but there are good(?) odds of it coming back. The first 9 years of her life she spent mostly in hospital, having brain/spinal surgeries and the accompanying treatments.

This brings me to my issue. Unfortunately, due to the nature of Lenas upbringing, she has no concept of the word ""No"". Whatever she asks for, she gets. She eats maybe one cooked meal a week, ans that's because she's bored of the local takeaway places. Her mother refuses to see her go without anything she asks for. Any day trip/activity/food/gadget she wants, she gets. And Lena knows it, wearing the same smug face any time me or my wife tell her no. If she's come to visit us and spend the night, any activity or film we have that she doesn't want will result in a screaming match.

Morgan, however, is the sweetest child I've ever met. He has both autism/ADHD, but is high functioning. His dad isn't in the picture. I've taken it upon myself to ""man him up"". By which I mean, since I met him for the first time 3 years ago, I've taught him how to pee standing up for example. 
He is 11, about to start secondary school, and he's not been taught how to ride a bike, or tie his own shoes (his mum will only get him velcro shoes because of this). 

Unknowingly (I hope) MIL's behaviour with Lena has caused Morgan to go without both in basic life skills, and life experiences. When he's home, he gets put in front of a screen and left to it. Lena will get days out to football matches, whatever she likes. If Morgan wants to do something (which is rare, I suspect it's because he knows what the answer will be) it has to be something Lena is able to do.

Anyway, on to my question. Lena has very recently had issues with her sight and spine, leading to Morgan being pushed further on to the sidelines.

I want Morgan to know/feel that there are adults in his life who care about him, and make him feel like a priority for a change. I have decided that next year, I would like my wife and I to take him to Disneyland Paris (Florida isn't an option for us) without Lena. My wife however, is concerned about backlash from the family about ""showing Morgan favouritism"".

I understand where she's coming from, but at the same time I feel that it's important for Morgan to be able to look back at moments of his childhood and think ""I was the centre of attention for a change"".

1,1e6qp3o,AITA for tearing apart my family? ,"Throwaway due to how personal this is and that some friends know my main account 

I(30F) was financially responsible for my family since I was 22. My parents were poor and always living paycheck to paycheck. My dad works but doesn’t make much and my mom is a SAHM and now retired. My brother barely graduated high school and cannot seem to hold down a job. 

I wanted to be a vet but my parents thought it wouldn’t make money and require too much school so they forced me to do CS. I like it but it isn’t my passion. They did pay for part of my college (I also had a partial scholarship). And the second I graduated they guilted me into giving at least half my paycheque to them. My mom said I owed her for giving birth to me and she got fat because of getting pregnant with me. I also learned they had a shotgun wedding because of me since being a single mom in our culture is extremely taboo. 

I was laid off Nov of last year. I didn’t cause it my entire team was let go because of an acquisition and they decided to axe the product I worked on. I got 3 months severance from that. When I told my parents I was expecting some sympathy but all they said was it was my fault because it was impossible to be laid off unless I did something wrong(they believe companies can do no wrong). I was shocked and extremely hurt when they told me I had 3 months to find a new job or not to bother speaking to them. Meanwhile my brother had basically not held down a job for most of his adult life and my parents didn’t mind. I had covered their rent and car payments since I was 23 and they were so ungrateful. 

I got engaged a month later on Christmas and my parents immediately began asking for money from my fiancé. He was shocked and I was so angry how they only saw me and now him as an ATM and cut them out of my life. I blocked them everywhere and refused to speak with them. My dad works but not for much and this month through relatives they told me they are going to go home since my grandparents will let them live with them for free. My brother refuses to go along and has been couch surfing. Last I heard he was staying at a homeless center. I’ve been called by every relative telling me what a shameful person I am for letting my parents be in poverty that they need to rely on their own parents. Everyone is threatening to boycott my wedding that I had been sending invites for.

We both sat down with wine, took two sheets of paper and started writing. And after looking at what I had written, she said it was terribly shallow on my part. I didn't know what it was about, but she explained that it was because I wrote ""Dark hair"" on may or may not have list.

4,1e6qaog,WIBTA for not reminding my parents about a deadline? ,"WIBTA for not reminding my parents about a deadline? 

I (f) work in the entertainment industry and a few years ago my team finished a movie. It was my first professional feature, and a big one. 

As usual, family and friends get to watch the movie in the cinema (exclusive for the occasion, after that it will be only on TV) a month earlier than its released on TV platforms, so I invited them. 

However, they had come from a trip and the movie was in 2 days and needed to travel 4h to come to the city. I proposed them to come, so they could watch the movie and meet my sister, who also lives there. You know, a classic 2x1! 

They refused to go after knowing that the movie would be on TV in a month. I reminded them that it was my first feature and that I really wanted them to come. They again refused, saying that the trip was not worth it for the movie and that they were tired (which I could understand).

I was disappointed but knew I couldn't fight that, so I went with my sister. It was hard to see all my team with their family and friends eager to see the movie. I had to push a bit my sister to come and I appreciate she did at the end since she doesn't like going to the cinema. 

My parents did see the first feature when it released after I pushed a bit too, and they watch a 90min movie in 2 days. 
Now, to the present. A new movie we made is coming out in half a month, also on TV, and I already asked them to come to the early screening. They said they would think about it, I told them I need to confirm it in 1 week time. 

Now, and here is we're I think I might be the ashole: I'm not reminding them about it. If they don't say anything, I will get a ticket for my sis to go with two friends if she wants but I won't go (I've already seen it plenty of times due to work).

6,1e6q3x7,AITA for refusing to play Mario Kart with my Mum?,"Last winter I (19f) bought a Switch for myself as I had spent a lot of time in my college’s game room with friends and I just wanted one for myself. I was never allowed to play video games as a kid so this had been a whole new territory for me and I was super excited to dive in. 
Since I was home from college at the time of the purchase I set it up with our TV and asked my mum if she’d like to play Mario Kart with me. So, over those few weeks of my winter break we played quite a bit of Mario Kart because that’s all she wanted to play. I of course played things on my own, but whenever she asked to play i of course let her because i just wanted to spend time with her, and it’s Mario Kart it’s always fun…right? 

I’ve been home for Summer break for 10 weeks now. I’m working a summer job so I don’t actually spend that much time at home. As soon as I connected my switch when I got home she immediately asked to play Mario Kart. I have no problem with this and honestly have so much fun playing with her. But it’s week 10..we play almost every night. I never thought you could get tired of Mario Kart but like I think I might actually go insane if I have to do Moo Moo Meadows one more time (that’s her favorite). I stopped playing for a bit, because I was just too tired from work. One night I heard a faint “ohh mama”. I open my bedroom door and there’s my mum playing single person Mario Kart. Turns out she’s done this every night since I’ve been home.  

I don’t mind her using my switch, I think it’s really funny and cute actually and such a big turn around from her thinking video games melt the brain. But, recently she’s been getting upset when I don’t play with her. I just wish she’d explore other games so I don’t lose my mind every time I hear the opening music.

My eldest (Maria) is the only one with an active father. My other two children’s fathers are one, in jail and two, refuse to help. I struggle a lot with money, and it’s very rare that I am able to give my kids birthday presents when the occasion comes.

Last year during Maria’s 13th birthday, my youngest started crying because he never gets any “cool” present on his birthday. Maria comforted him and told him that when she got her presents from her father, she would sell them and get him and my other daughter presents so they could play with toys.

This was such a wonderful idea and I was very proud of her for being so selfless. Well, her birthday was this Monday, her father threw her a birthday party where of course she got a bunch of presents from not just him but her grandparents too. One of her presents was a makeup kit she had been wanting for forever, but I hadn’t been able to buy it for her.

Later that evening, she was moving all the stuff to her room, and I told her “So I need you to decide what you’re going to keep, so I can sell the rest. Your siblings need presents too, like you said” 

She froze, and immediately started saying that she was just trying to make her siblings feel better back then. That she wanted to keep her presents now, since she got everything she wanted from her dad. I shook my head and told her that she can’t promise something like that and then break her promise, that’s not how life works. 

She started crying, asking why I can’t just buy them stuff, despite knowing that I only make enough money for bills and food. She finally ended up giving me some of her stuff, albeit with some attitude. She barely talked to me these past few days, and when her father came to get her today for some time together, she apparently told him what happened because he came storming in MY house, yelling at me about it.

I told him very clearly that I have two other children that deserve attention and gifts, and that Maria will be perfectly okay with only some of the stuff. He got more mad and said that those were presents for his daughter, and that if I wanted presents for the other two so bad, I should’ve just asked him, not *“steal”* from Maria. 

He took Maria and slammed the door, and when they came back, Maria had even more stuff from her dad. We had a discussion where he said I was being horrible to her and an awful mom, despite the fact that I very clearly told him my reasons for doing what I did. I’m very pissed off. He’s just teaching Maria that she can go back on her word whenever she wants.

She froze, and immediately started saying that she was just trying to make her siblings feel better back then. That she wanted to keep her presents now, since she got everything she wanted from her dad. I shook my head and told her that she can’t promise something like that and then break her promise, that’s not how life works. 

She started crying, asking why I can’t just buy them stuff, despite knowing that I only make enough money for bills and food. She finally ended up giving me some of her stuff, albeit with some attitude. She barely talked to me these past few days, and when her father came to get her today for some time together, she apparently told him what happened because he came storming in MY house, yelling at me about it.

I told him very clearly that I have two other children that deserve attention and gifts, and that Maria will be perfectly okay with only some of the stuff. He got more mad and said that those were presents for his daughter, and that if I wanted presents for the other two so bad, I should’ve just asked him, not *“steal”* from Maria. 

He took Maria and slammed the door, and when they came back, Maria had even more stuff from her dad. We had a discussion where he said I was being horrible to her and an awful mom, despite the fact that I very clearly told him my reasons for doing what I did. I’m very pissed off. He’s just teaching Maria that she can go back on her word whenever she wants.
