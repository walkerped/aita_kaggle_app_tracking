0,1e6qwtm,WIBTA For taking my younger BIL to Disneyland Paris?,"For pretext, my wife has 3 younger siblings. L (f25, but not important in this scenario), Lena (13f), and Morgan (11m).

Lena was unfortunately born with an extensive list of medical issues, resulting in her spending the majority of her early childhood battling a rare form of brain cancer. She is currently in the clear, but there are good(?) odds of it coming back. The first 9 years of her life she spent mostly in hospital, having brain/spinal surgeries and the accompanying treatments.

This brings me to my issue. Unfortunately, due to the nature of Lenas upbringing, she has no concept of the word ""No"". Whatever she asks for, she gets. She eats maybe one cooked meal a week, ans that's because she's bored of the local takeaway places. Her mother refuses to see her go without anything she asks for. Any day trip/activity/food/gadget she wants, she gets. And Lena knows it, wearing the same smug face any time me or my wife tell her no. If she's come to visit us and spend the night, any activity or film we have that she doesn't want will result in a screaming match.

Morgan, however, is the sweetest child I've ever met. He has both autism/ADHD, but is high functioning. His dad isn't in the picture. I've taken it upon myself to ""man him up"". By which I mean, since I met him for the first time 3 years ago, I've taught him how to pee standing up for example. 
He is 11, about to start secondary school, and he's not been taught how to ride a bike, or tie his own shoes (his mum will only get him velcro shoes because of this). 

Unknowingly (I hope) MIL's behaviour with Lena has caused Morgan to go without both in basic life skills, and life experiences. When he's home, he gets put in front of a screen and left to it. Lena will get days out to football matches, whatever she likes. If Morgan wants to do something (which is rare, I suspect it's because he knows what the answer will be) it has to be something Lena is able to do.

Anyway, on to my question. Lena has very recently had issues with her sight and spine, leading to Morgan being pushed further on to the sidelines.

I want Morgan to know/feel that there are adults in his life who care about him, and make him feel like a priority for a change. I have decided that next year, I would like my wife and I to take him to Disneyland Paris (Florida isn't an option for us) without Lena. My wife however, is concerned about backlash from the family about ""showing Morgan favouritism"".

I understand where she's coming from, but at the same time I feel that it's important for Morgan to be able to look back at moments of his childhood and think ""I was the centre of attention for a change"".

1,1e6qp3o,AITA for tearing apart my family? ,"Throwaway due to how personal this is and that some friends know my main account 

I(30F) was financially responsible for my family since I was 22. My parents were poor and always living paycheck to paycheck. My dad works but doesn’t make much and my mom is a SAHM and now retired. My brother barely graduated high school and cannot seem to hold down a job. 

I wanted to be a vet but my parents thought it wouldn’t make money and require too much school so they forced me to do CS. I like it but it isn’t my passion. They did pay for part of my college (I also had a partial scholarship). And the second I graduated they guilted me into giving at least half my paycheque to them. My mom said I owed her for giving birth to me and she got fat because of getting pregnant with me. I also learned they had a shotgun wedding because of me since being a single mom in our culture is extremely taboo. 

I was laid off Nov of last year. I didn’t cause it my entire team was let go because of an acquisition and they decided to axe the product I worked on. I got 3 months severance from that. When I told my parents I was expecting some sympathy but all they said was it was my fault because it was impossible to be laid off unless I did something wrong(they believe companies can do no wrong). I was shocked and extremely hurt when they told me I had 3 months to find a new job or not to bother speaking to them. Meanwhile my brother had basically not held down a job for most of his adult life and my parents didn’t mind. I had covered their rent and car payments since I was 23 and they were so ungrateful. 

I got engaged a month later on Christmas and my parents immediately began asking for money from my fiancé. He was shocked and I was so angry how they only saw me and now him as an ATM and cut them out of my life. I blocked them everywhere and refused to speak with them. My dad works but not for much and this month through relatives they told me they are going to go home since my grandparents will let them live with them for free. My brother refuses to go along and has been couch surfing. Last I heard he was staying at a homeless center. I’ve been called by every relative telling me what a shameful person I am for letting my parents be in poverty that they need to rely on their own parents. Everyone is threatening to boycott my wedding that I had been sending invites for.

We both sat down with wine, took two sheets of paper and started writing. And after looking at what I had written, she said it was terribly shallow on my part. I didn't know what it was about, but she explained that it was because I wrote ""Dark hair"" on may or may not have list.

4,1e6qaog,WIBTA for not reminding my parents about a deadline? ,"WIBTA for not reminding my parents about a deadline? 

I (f) work in the entertainment industry and a few years ago my team finished a movie. It was my first professional feature, and a big one. 

As usual, family and friends get to watch the movie in the cinema (exclusive for the occasion, after that it will be only on TV) a month earlier than its released on TV platforms, so I invited them. 

However, they had come from a trip and the movie was in 2 days and needed to travel 4h to come to the city. I proposed them to come, so they could watch the movie and meet my sister, who also lives there. You know, a classic 2x1! 

They refused to go after knowing that the movie would be on TV in a month. I reminded them that it was my first feature and that I really wanted them to come. They again refused, saying that the trip was not worth it for the movie and that they were tired (which I could understand).

I was disappointed but knew I couldn't fight that, so I went with my sister. It was hard to see all my team with their family and friends eager to see the movie. I had to push a bit my sister to come and I appreciate she did at the end since she doesn't like going to the cinema. 

My parents did see the first feature when it released after I pushed a bit too, and they watch a 90min movie in 2 days. 
Now, to the present. A new movie we made is coming out in half a month, also on TV, and I already asked them to come to the early screening. They said they would think about it, I told them I need to confirm it in 1 week time. 

Now, and here is we're I think I might be the ashole: I'm not reminding them about it. If they don't say anything, I will get a ticket for my sis to go with two friends if she wants but I won't go (I've already seen it plenty of times due to work).

6,1e6q3x7,AITA for refusing to play Mario Kart with my Mum?,"Last winter I (19f) bought a Switch for myself as I had spent a lot of time in my college’s game room with friends and I just wanted one for myself. I was never allowed to play video games as a kid so this had been a whole new territory for me and I was super excited to dive in. 
Since I was home from college at the time of the purchase I set it up with our TV and asked my mum if she’d like to play Mario Kart with me. So, over those few weeks of my winter break we played quite a bit of Mario Kart because that’s all she wanted to play. I of course played things on my own, but whenever she asked to play i of course let her because i just wanted to spend time with her, and it’s Mario Kart it’s always fun…right? 

I’ve been home for Summer break for 10 weeks now. I’m working a summer job so I don’t actually spend that much time at home. As soon as I connected my switch when I got home she immediately asked to play Mario Kart. I have no problem with this and honestly have so much fun playing with her. But it’s week 10..we play almost every night. I never thought you could get tired of Mario Kart but like I think I might actually go insane if I have to do Moo Moo Meadows one more time (that’s her favorite). I stopped playing for a bit, because I was just too tired from work. One night I heard a faint “ohh mama”. I open my bedroom door and there’s my mum playing single person Mario Kart. Turns out she’s done this every night since I’ve been home.  

I don’t mind her using my switch, I think it’s really funny and cute actually and such a big turn around from her thinking video games melt the brain. But, recently she’s been getting upset when I don’t play with her. I just wish she’d explore other games so I don’t lose my mind every time I hear the opening music.

My eldest (Maria) is the only one with an active father. My other two children’s fathers are one, in jail and two, refuse to help. I struggle a lot with money, and it’s very rare that I am able to give my kids birthday presents when the occasion comes.

Last year during Maria’s 13th birthday, my youngest started crying because he never gets any “cool” present on his birthday. Maria comforted him and told him that when she got her presents from her father, she would sell them and get him and my other daughter presents so they could play with toys.

This was such a wonderful idea and I was very proud of her for being so selfless. Well, her birthday was this Monday, her father threw her a birthday party where of course she got a bunch of presents from not just him but her grandparents too. One of her presents was a makeup kit she had been wanting for forever, but I hadn’t been able to buy it for her.

Later that evening, she was moving all the stuff to her room, and I told her “So I need you to decide what you’re going to keep, so I can sell the rest. Your siblings need presents too, like you said” 

She froze, and immediately started saying that she was just trying to make her siblings feel better back then. That she wanted to keep her presents now, since she got everything she wanted from her dad. I shook my head and told her that she can’t promise something like that and then break her promise, that’s not how life works. 

She started crying, asking why I can’t just buy them stuff, despite knowing that I only make enough money for bills and food. She finally ended up giving me some of her stuff, albeit with some attitude. She barely talked to me these past few days, and when her father came to get her today for some time together, she apparently told him what happened because he came storming in MY house, yelling at me about it.

I told him very clearly that I have two other children that deserve attention and gifts, and that Maria will be perfectly okay with only some of the stuff. He got more mad and said that those were presents for his daughter, and that if I wanted presents for the other two so bad, I should’ve just asked him, not *“steal”* from Maria. 

He took Maria and slammed the door, and when they came back, Maria had even more stuff from her dad. We had a discussion where he said I was being horrible to her and an awful mom, despite the fact that I very clearly told him my reasons for doing what I did. I’m very pissed off. He’s just teaching Maria that she can go back on her word whenever she wants.

She froze, and immediately started saying that she was just trying to make her siblings feel better back then. That she wanted to keep her presents now, since she got everything she wanted from her dad. I shook my head and told her that she can’t promise something like that and then break her promise, that’s not how life works. 

She started crying, asking why I can’t just buy them stuff, despite knowing that I only make enough money for bills and food. She finally ended up giving me some of her stuff, albeit with some attitude. She barely talked to me these past few days, and when her father came to get her today for some time together, she apparently told him what happened because he came storming in MY house, yelling at me about it.

I told him very clearly that I have two other children that deserve attention and gifts, and that Maria will be perfectly okay with only some of the stuff. He got more mad and said that those were presents for his daughter, and that if I wanted presents for the other two so bad, I should’ve just asked him, not *“steal”* from Maria. 

He took Maria and slammed the door, and when they came back, Maria had even more stuff from her dad. We had a discussion where he said I was being horrible to her and an awful mom, despite the fact that I very clearly told him my reasons for doing what I did. I’m very pissed off. He’s just teaching Maria that she can go back on her word whenever she wants.

However, today a family parked in the handicap spot with all of my other spaces opened. I saw that they were eating and gave them about twenty minutes to see if they’d leave. I looked at their license plates which had no handicap emblem and no placard hanging from the mirror.

After not leaving for twenty minutes, I go out and ask them to leave my handicap spot in case someone needs to use it and that’s where I think my wording could have been different. They followed up by saying that they are handicapped and have a placard (they motioned to their dash but I didn’t see anything). I asked well oh are you coming into my store? And they said not anymore. Not a big deal but can clearly tell they’re upset.

9,1e7hpkl,AITA for how I behaved on my final day of work experience?,"I, 17M live in the UK and it is required for people my age to do a work placement/internship.

This week, other students from other schools also did their work experience. One of them was dismissed for bad conduct. Another girl barely showed up. And there were two other girls who got on with the work with me but they were only there for four days.

Today, I was the only student working. I anticipated more work because as the week went on, the work I was given increased in volume because of the situations of the other students. I was also given work that’d normally be done by actual staff as they called in sick. I was asked to do it in a specific time frame and when I checked with a colleague, she said to me that placement students shouldn’t be given the work I’d been assigned. She also said that the timeframes I’d been given are also ones they’re given and even they struggle to meet but I didn’t let it discourage me and still by the skin of my teeth, managed to have it done.

I went on my break at 1pm, I got an hour so it ended at 2pm. At 2:30pm, I went to the toilet. Earlier that week, I had a stomach bug and while I felt mostly okay, the pains still hadn’t gone completely away. I took five minutes and when I came back, the manager called me into his office, accusing me of slacking and taking half an hour extra of break because he ‘looked everywhere’ since 2pm for me and couldn’t find me. He said to me if he looked at the camera it would prove his point so I insisted he did. When it showed I was only gone five minutes and I had been working, he still persisted in accusing me until a colleague heard him and stood up to him for me because apparently in the time he said he was looking for me, he was actually seen by multiple staff having a conversation with a family friend who happened to be in the store. He then tried to accuse me of ‘resting’ as I was knelt down at the time he found me but the reason I was knelt down was because I was putting something on a low shelf. I then started to lose my patience. I said ‘Clearly the cameras have proved my point and legally, I’m allowed to use the toilet just like any other staff at any period during the day.

10,1e7hojz,AITA for not planning anything for my boyfriend's 30th birthday?,"So, backstory, our relationship has been quite... rocky and I think it will most likely end soon. We've been together four years, but in that time he has been a student and hasn't worked at all, and I have basically been supporting the two of us with my meagre salary (in-between him borrowing money from his sister). This has ended up with me incurring thousands of dollars in credit card debt covering both of our expenses, so anything expensive (a trip, a nice dinner) is simply not in my budget.

So, I'll keep it short. I (18M) who's been dating my girlfriend, also 18, for over a month. Some context about me: I've always wanted a cat as a pet ever since I was a child, but my parents never agreed. Recently, my parents told me they were going to buy me a kitten. However, they eventually backed out, saying that ""having a pet is too much work,"" which made me feel shitty because they hyped me up for no reason. I told them I didn't want a fancy cat; rather, a cat from the local shelter would be fine. My dad eventually agreed, but my mom kept scolding me a lot, which made me so upset that I stormed off, saying I didn't want a cat anymore, and cried alone in my room (PS: I never cry). 

When my girlfriend called, I told her about the whole situation. She knows I'm never vulnerable. I expected some comforting words, but she told me I deserved a slap and that she would've beaten me up if I were her child. She said I was a ""brat"" for crying and storming off just because I wasn't getting a cat. She also said she didn't give a crap about my feelings and that they were invalid. I didn't say anything at that moment since I was already so stressed, but I kept thinking about how if I didn't confront her about it, she'd continue being dismissive about my feelings and make me feel like crap every time I felt vulnerable, since it would become the ""new normal"" for her.

Back to tonight: I told her about it while we were talking on the phone, and instead of understanding me, she got mad and first told me I indeed acted like a ""brat"" and that she wouldn't ""entertain"" my bratty behavior because those feelings of mine were just not valid (I'm literally not kidding; this is what she actually said). She ended up giving me the silent treatment and then hung up the phone. I called her back, but she told me she had nothing to say, wished me a ""good night,"" and went to sleep.

17,1e7ftgm,AITA for fighting back against my roommate who doesn't want a fridge?,"I (19M) am moving into a college dorm this fall with two of my good friends (both 19M). Since the school year is getting closer, we've started talking about logistics for the room, and I brought up the need for a fridge. For context, the school we go to lets us rent mini fridges and microwaves together for $250. When I texted the guys asking if they would want to rent, one of them, let's call him Skateboard, was all for it. The other one, let's call him Notebook, said he didn't want to because he never used his fridge during the previous year. We talked it out, and after mentioning that I always store ice cream and applesauce in the fridge for late night snacks, he said ""I fw that"" and agreed on renting. 

Split three ways the set would be about $85 each which I made clear to them before we agreed. All was well until this morning when I texted asking them to Venmo me the $85 so I could place the order to the school. Skateboard was ready to go for it, but Notebook basically said he wanted to keep his $85 because he isn't making as much money this summer as he thought he would. He then asked if we could just buy our own fridge and not rent from the school. I explained how that doesn't make as much sense because buying our own would cost about the same amount as renting because the rental also includes the microwave. It also means that one of us would have to both bring it to school and back home for the summer. Skateboard and I get to school by plane, so it would be really difficult to take the fridge with us, meaning it would have to be Notebook who takes it. 

We tried explaining all this to him but he hasn't responded to any of our texts. Should I be more sympathetic to his cause?

18,1e7fpgn,AITA for turning around on a hike I was unfit to complete?,"I went on a hike with some friends this week, which we planned on doing over 5 days. After a day and half, I realized I was not physically fit enough to complete the rest of the hike, and made the decision that I was going to turn around before it was too late. For context, it’s ~35 miles into a mountain range with 2000ft of elevation gain per day, I do not do much cardio or hiking, though I am relatively fit. I do have some cardiac issues and am particularly susceptible to altitude sickness, though it was certainly my fault for overestimating my abilities. I shouldn’t have went in the first place, but to be honest, the trip was partially my idea. 

However, I made it very clear to my friends that I myself was going to turn around, and I wanted them to complete it without me. At no point did I ever ask them to turn around, as a matter of fact I explicitly told them not to turn around with me as I didn’t want to ruin the trip for them.

Yet, they turned around with me, which I did appreciate, but I would rather them have finished it without me, as I made very clear to everyone. Of course we were a bit disappointed that we didn’t finish it, but when they claimed it was my fault, I couldn’t help but disagree. I argued for 30 minutes trying to get them to continue without me.

I chose to turn around because I knew it would be a risk to all of us had I continued on, especially if things got worse, and we were already 10 miles deep so it was best to make the decision before it was too late. We also had no PLB or connection to the outside world, so there was no way to call for help if things got bad. I was willing to accept the risk that came with returning solo, as it is heavy grizzly bear country, but I did have bear defense.

Once we finally got back, everyone claimed how I ruined their weekend. I can see why they think that, but I explicitly told them not to follow me back, and to continue the hike without me. They say it was my fault they didn’t get to finish it. Tbh it made me feel like shit and I don’t think I want to go on another trip with them because I don’t want to risk ruining it.

For a bit more context, these are my best friends whom I’ve known my whole life. I don’t hold any resentment towards them, and I am 100% confident we will remain friends for many years to come, if not for the rest of our lives. We are still hanging out today, but I can’t help but feel like they hold some level of resentment for my decision to turn back on the hike. 

Am I the asshole for ruining everyone’s weekend? I thought I made the right choice but I feel as though I may not have. 

Edit: thanks for your input everyone, I realize that I grossly overestimated my abilities and I apologized to the whole group. I am very grateful that they were looking out for me, and they are undoubtedly the best friends I could have. Nobody holds any resentment, we were just upset at the time.

19,1e7fiez,AITAH for leaving plan b in sf’s car,"
(23f) I planned on spending a two-week vacation with my mother in South America. Before my flight, I met with my boyfriend (23M) and we said our goodbyes. This goodbye led to us needing Plan B, so we took his car to buy one. While with him, I took the Plan B. I made sure to check if I left anything before I left because he lives with his parents and they don't want him to have a girlfriend, but it was also two hours before my flight and i hadn’t packed so i wasn’t thinking too clearly. 

Unfortunately, his father found the Plan B label while I was on vacation. Now, my boyfriend is furious with me, told me his father would disown him, and told me he doesn’t think he can continue our relationship. When he broke up with me, I apologized and accepted the breakup, which upset him and made him doubt my loyalty because he didn’t really mean to break up with me. He has done this a couple of times, and I admit I usually fight harder. Now, he says he needs time and space to consider our relationship. It’s been a week and he still doesn’t know about getting back together. He hasn’t been kicked out and as far as i know he hasn’t been disinherited.

AITAH for not wanting to give him this space and time ? for forgetting the plan b label in the car? Is he justified in wanting space, or should I consider ending the relationship?

Further context: i paid for the plan b and he never Zelled me for his half? He told me he would pay for the whole thing. Should i ask for it? He gets paid significantly more than me.

Alright so I started college last year (19F)  and I met nice people and befriended this guy (19M) within my major. The only reason why I was nice to him is because nobody else was. He was obnoxious and told really corny jokes that would annoy tf out of everyone. He had poor hygene and he reeked. Still I was nice to him only because I felt bad for him and I didnt want to be a bitch. Being his friend felt like a chore and I still dragged it out because I thought I could handle it. This friendship was also very forced from his behalf. Like we just met a few months ago, no I don't want to look at apartments with you. No I don't want to dogsit/house sit for your family who I havent even met. Like why would they have me a random 19 year old take care of their house for a summer?!This man also didnt take no for an answer when I wasn't comfortable sleeping over his dorm or house sitting for his entire family. He would keep pushing me to say yes when i was clearly uncomfortable.  Still i stood my ground and didn't end up doing anything. To be clear i didnt think he had developed feelings for me because he was bisexual and in a relashionship with a man. Anyways he was a narcisist and was never truly there for me when I had problems. He treated my issues like gossip or ""tea time"". Also whenever I would talk about my intrests he would cut me off and talk about his own intrests. He was super cocky and would brag a lot. He was so up his own ass that at times I felt like he made up lies to impress me. Anyways the final nail in the coffin for me was when I told him my brother was in the hospital and he started holding my hand and looking me in the eyes. He was trying so hard to fake sympathy for me. So the hand holding was so very weird I called my other friend and vented to him and my other friend said ""yeah he told me he had a crush on you before he started dating his boyfriend"". I was beyond angry because since the beginning of time I was aware that he was in a relashionship. I dont know what to believe from him and so I decided to ghost him this entire summer.

(March 14- April 2nd). She left to stay in a safe house and left her stuff at my place, I said I would keep it until she gets out.
She left the safe house three months ago (April 19th) and about two months ago(May 4th) I ask her to fetch her stuff,my family was complaining about it lying around,she said she would get it month end. She didn't. I wrote exams in June so I wasn't able to ask remind her to fetch her stuff. My parents asked me 2 days ago to check when she will fetch her stuff and she finally fetched it.

Today she messaged me asking me ""why I used a laptop she said I wasn't allowed to use?"" And she asked what the new pim for her laptop is? I was confused as I only remember using that laptop for things that she  needed, like her CV, chekfing her Gmail. She said not it was opened to one of my profiles. I then remembered that my sister used her laptop once as hers broke and I told my sister to not go any further as I needed to ask permission. That was June 1st.vMy friend said I could use her other laptop not the one we were using, I didn't tell her that we had started using it. I completely forgot as we didn't touch it again. I may have been the A-hole for not telling her that we used it and forgetting that we used it. My friend has now restricted her IG account and has blocked me on WhatsApp before even reading my explanation.

She also told me that she doesn't appreciate being lied to, I used her stuff and then told her to fetch her things now that we done. Which is not true, she should not have had to be asked to pick it up, she was asked twice. I understand that she is upset with us using her stuff but I completely forgot that we used that laptop and couldn't even explain that to her. 


She didn't fetch her stuff when she said she would so I am confused as to why she is mad that I asked her to fetch her stuff, remember that I asked her to fetch her stuff on the May 4 and asked to use the laptop June 1st. I asked her to pick up her things before using the laptop. 

I also did not change her pin, I used the pin she told me to use. I think blocking me is quite petty as she didn't let me explain what happened. I also don't think it is my responsibility to tell her to fetch her stuff as she is an adult.

We didn't charge her rent or charge for storage fees.

I sent her a message in response to her accusing me of lying and asking her to fetch her stuff after I finished using it, by telling her I shouldn't have to tell her to fetch her stuff, she is an adult and it is her stuff, not mine.

I told him he could visit whenever he wanted and could call daily if he wanted. But he has not been consistent on either front. I get that emotions are raw but we both wanted to work things out and be a family but knew time apart was needed (among other things). 
Yesterday i told him that he either needed to come home and work on our family and be an active dad (being where he is he isnt at all going to get sober like he says he wants), to take me to court to set up visitation schedule (which id be going for supervised until he proved he was sober and had better living arrangements) or that i wanted him to walk away and leave us alone so we could grieve, heal and move on as the whole back and forth and inconsistency was not in anyones best interest.

Yesterday i told him that he either needed to come home and work on our family and be an active dad (being where he is he isnt at all going to get sober like he says he wants), to take me to court to set up visitation schedule (which id be going for supervised until he proved he was sober and had better living arrangements) or that i wanted him to walk away and leave us alone so we could grieve, heal and move on as the whole back and forth and inconsistency was not in anyones best interest. 
I feel terrible even giving him this ultimatum, all i truly want is our family together and healthy (on all fronts) but our children and i cannot handle his lack of commitment or his back and forth on what he wants.

I always try to be at my best behavior so nobody correlates me with my mom but i feel like people will always think that. 

after that incident we went out and i suggested she comes back to my house since my moms out. she explained why she couldn’t then she went on a rant on how shitty my mother is. I was very understanding but shocked i needed and minute to collect my thoughts. I then explained to her how my mother is and shes mentally unwell and i’m sorry for that but that shouldn’t stand in the way in us chilling in my house and having a normal friendship then she went off on how i was trying to excuse her actions and how a person can change if they want to and how everyone knows their actions if its wrong and i tried to explain that after many years of studying my moms behavior in HS and college that she will never see that. after the hangout she was like u ruin the mood whenever things don’t go “ur way” which is something her mom always tells her about my mom. 
i may be like my mother or she just might be envy of the fact that my parents let me study abroad and always give me what i want from cars jewlery and such. so she thinks that im spoiled and always want things “my way” . keep in mind she always shows that shes secure with what she has. and i always am humble

i (19f) and my friend (18f) always want shirts we see on tiktok lol. recently, she saw a shirt at a retail chain, but the closest store to us is 25 miles away.

she seemed to really want it, and planned to get it, so we went to look for it since we both had free days. we took my car bc i tend to work a little bit more than she does.

anyway, it was going super well, we had a great time, and she found the shirt. then we got to checkout. she said ""i don't have much money, should i even get it?"" i said ""i think so, i mean, we drove all the way here just for this.""

she debated and didn't get it. all i said was, ""hey, maybe next time you can't afford the shirt we're driving so far for, could you please tell me so we can postpone it?"" - i said it kindly, i wasn't mad. i was just saying bc i didn't want something like this to happen again. 

she froze me out afterwards. and now she's angry at me. i'm pissed only because she definitely knew she couldn't afford a $10 shirt right now, but didn't tell me. she let me drive just to find it and put it back. and again, i don't mind driving far for my friends and family, my issue lies only in the fact that she was okay with me driving just to not have enough for it.

now I'm not saying this to show off or anything! I'm just saying that I gave it my all and honestly thought I did a pretty good job given my capabilities at the moment, and she seemed really happy throughout the night.

now one thing about me I NEVER post anyone on my story for their birthday, I don't think it's necessary as long as I show them real love and appreciation on that day, it feels shallow to me for some reason. so it didn't even cross my mind that day and plus my mind was already occupied by picking up the cake and the preparations.

When she took the test, an interesting thing popped up. The man on her birth certificate, also was NOT her father! Her mother had an affair at some point (she has 10 brothers and sisters). I kept this secret from her until this last February when I decided it was time she knew the truth. I didn't want to be like her and kept that secret from her. She came to my house for lunch, and I told her. When she left to decided to block me on her phone. About a week ago, I asked my husband to call her to see if she wanted any souvenirs (we were in Mexico city at the time). She went on a tirade about how she wanted nothing to do with me because I was trying to ruin her life. When my husband asked about how I was going to get my birth certificate (it can be done retroactively) she said that it was my problem and I'd have to figure out on my own. Which isn't possible since she is still alive. The part I am having a hard time with is it doesn't really matter. Her parents are all dead and its not like she plans to ever have contact with her siblings. I have made no attempt to contact anyone on 23andMe to get info about family as that was her wish. I only wanted to share what I found so that she would know the truth. Have I ruined her life? Am I the asshole? ",0.0,1.0339716672897339,1,0
31,1e7cigf,AITA for my reaction to my husband interrupting me?,"Hey. So let me start by saying I adore my husband. We’ve been together since 2013 and he’s my best friend; he’s sweet and hilarious and I’d be devastated without him. 

But… he has always had this terribly frustrating habit of interrupting me mid sentence. I don’t mean like I’m giving some speech and he’s trying to converse or get a word in edgewise. It’s more like I will be telling him “So this guy at work last night was telling us about his cat-“

Husband: “and it died.”

Me: “No… wtf why say that? You weren’t there; I’m telling you about it.”

And on and on. Last night we were checking out the RNC and I said: “the last president I believed in was Obama. He was a constitutional-“

Husband: “criminal.”

These are just a couple examples. It’s usually some conspiracy bs/dark/sarcastic comment. I don’t understand. I basically yelled at him about it last night and told him that I’m just going to stop speaking every single time he does this. I explained to him, this has been going on for years and when he does it, it makes me feel like he’s not even listening and doesn’t even care. I know that’s not true. He will not cut me off for months and months and then it will become a habit again.

Also - very important info is that he has hearing issues that he refuses to seek help for. And he also has a history of concussions. Am I wrong for getting so frustrated? What should I do?

Edit/Update: I’m very grateful for the responses. It’s validation for my feelings but also has brought up feelings that lead me to think about other possibilities. People have mentioned ADHD, and he might have that— he does lose his train of thought and basically interrupts HIMSELF. He can start talking about one thing and go off on a bizarre tangent having nothing to do with his original topic.

I am the AH for knowing about these things and letting them go sometimes. But I am not the AH for recognizing this isn’t ok. 

Thanks everyone, he really is a sweetheart and a great guy but I think the problem may be more physical/medical after all. I will do anything I can to get him any help he needs.

32,1e7ce83,AITA for ignoring my cousins and their IG posts after being excluded from the family vacation?,"I, 32f, am being called “rude” for not liking my cousin’s instagram post of the family vacation I was excluded from. 

Since I was a little kid, my family (mom, brother and dad) has always gone on a beach vacation to the same spot with my cousins (family of 6), where we would all share a house together. My aunt and uncle always stayed an extra week, and often had other guests come during that time. 

Over the last decade, both my brother and dad passed away. Since then, my mom and I were always still invited, and would go on this family vacation, which always happened to be over my brother’s birthday. It was always very therapeutic and truly some of the only times I felt true joy over the years, in part because it was only time I felt like I had a family.

This past year, my cousin’s family grew a lot with new fiancés and children, and ultimately, my mom and I weren’t invited on the trip. While I understand the family is now too big, I can’t help but wonder why we couldn’t have figured something out, whether it be a second house or switching between the weeks. 

The fact that we were excluded has been weighing on my heart, as if there’s no place for me anywhere in that family anymore. I feel even more hurt that none of my cousins (who I thought were like my sisters), bothered to reach out to me to tell me they were going or say “I wish so much you were here, we miss you”, or anything. Instead, it’s just been silence. I only found out they went when, right before my brother’s birthday, my cousin posted an Instagram documenting the trip. I was bawling when I saw it, and my heart still hurts from being excluded and missing out. Needless to say, I didn’t “like” the post. 

Somehow, my mom and I got to talking about it and she asked me if I liked my cousins post. I told her no way, and I doubt anyone would notice. She me feel incredibly guilty and wrong, I think her exact words were that it was “very rude of me”.

I’m honestly upset with them, and have no interest in talking to any of them for the time being. apparently am in the wrong for that, too. AITA?

33,1e7cclu,AITA for getting a short haircut when my sister has short hair?,"For the past month, I’ve been very excited to get my hair cut. It had been a while, and my hair was starting to get too long for my liking, always kinda in my face and too heavy for summer. I was going to a new barber for the first time at a shop near my workplace. I was really psyched because it was a notably queer-friendly barber shop, and I’m nonbinary; I love masc hairstyles and it’d been hard to get a really masc cut from my regular stylist. This haircut went great and I was super happy with the result—short hair with an undercut.

When my family saw my hair, my sister flipped. She immediately said, “I can’t believe you’re copying my hair!” and got very upset. Our mom tried to step in, saying she liked my hair and trying to move the conversation away from that, but my sister went on to say “Why doesn’t anyone care about my feelings?” and continued to rant. She was incensed over my haircut, and I could not compute. I stepped away from the situation.

For reference, my sister has short hair with no undercut, and her hair is dyed a couple different colors. Mine is not dyed.

34,1e7cbfg,AITA for uninviting my friend on a girls trip that led to the end of our friendship? ,"I (21F) had a girls trip that my friends and I had planned for months. For context, my friend (22F) and I, let's call her Kayla have been bestfriends since we were little, probably since the age of 5. We were very close and had a lot of love for each other. I considered her one of my bestfriends, until she started treating me differently. She became extremely self involved and whenever she had a boyfriend in her life, it's as if I didn't even exist to her. As of 2yrs ago, my mom was battling breast cancer. I had talked to her multiple times about the beginning of my mom’s cancer treatment and the overall journey and she gave me the bare minimum. A few weeks later, I was with some of my friends & I started to talk about what was going on at home and how stressful everything was and she looked at me and said ""what, I didn't know your mom had cancer, why is this the first I'm hearing of it"". I thought what the actual hell. So I told her very firmly that I have talked to her about this on multiple occasions. A few days later I confronted her about how hurt I was and how l needed her to put continual effort in this relationship for it to continue. She answered saying she was sorry and that she would try harder. This was the first of many events that I started to question our friendship. 

All this happened 2 years before our trip. Over the 2 years, she never asked me how I was, she was never there for me when I needed her, when we hung out, all we ever talked about was her and what was going on in her life, and she only ever asked to see me when she needed something. I started to give less as this relationship was clearly a one way street.

Kayla was initially invited on this trip well in advance, about 7 months prior. Although we were going through a rough patch, I had decided that maybe this will bring us closer together. My other friends and I were actively planning it and getting all the details together, we were figuring out all the details, costs, dates, time off work, places etc. I would actively ask Kayla if she still wanted to come on this trip and she would leave me with unanswered questions or just shrug it off. Fast forward to a few days before we leave, I tell her that we're going on this trip without her because she couldn't give me a straight answer and I hope that there are no hard feelings moving forward. Well she flipped out and called me selfish and inconsiderate and how could I possibly think that she would still want to be friends with me after pulling some shit like that. So we had a huge argument and I told her how l've been feeling regarding our friendship and she completely lost it and told me that she's always been there for me and that I ruined our friendship because of this. This was two weeks ago and I have now gotten back from my trip and have not talked to her since. I've tried reaching out and having a conversation, but she's blocked me on everything.

35,1e7c8vf,AITAH for not making my brother's soon-to-be ex-wife give up her plane ticket to his current girlfriend?,"My(30f) brother who is 36 years old filed for divorce from from his wife of three years just two months ago after he discovered that she has been cheating on him. Before her secret came to light, my family and I planned a week vacation to Orlando, FL in which we travel to late next month. Three months ago, tickets were already paid for. My brother paid full price for his while pitching in for his ex-wife's ticket who did put a little more than he did towards it. However, after he filed for divorce he started dating his current girlfriend. They been together for a month and some weeks now.

Last Sunday, my parents hosted a Sunday dinner at their home and my brother's girlfriend was invited. We were talking about the trip and when my sister who is 28 suggested my brother's ex to get a room of her own since the two are no longer together I noticed a look his girlfriend had on her face, however she said nothing and stayed quiet. 

After dinner, the girlfriend pulled me to the side and said that she had no ideal my brother's ex was still going on the trip. My response was a simple yeah. She proceed to tell me that she was not comfortable with the ideal of the ex still being allowed to go on the trip. She then asked if it was okay that the ticket went to her instead since she's now with my brother. I politely told her that I didn't think it would be right for me to give her my former SIL's ticket since she did put money towards the ticket. Girlfriend then ask me if I didn't think it would be disrespectful to her if I was still allowing former SIL to go on the trip. I told her I'm sorry she feels that way, but that I still wasn't going to make ex-wife give up her plane ticket. I also told her that she is more than welcome to purchase her on ticket and come with us if she wanted to. That wasn't good enough for her because she still doesn't want to see ex-wife's face on the trip. 

The main reason why my brother's girlfriend is not cool with ex still being around is because of their unfortunate encounter. According to my brother, a couple of weeks ago his girlfriend was at my brother's house at the time former SIL showed up to collect some more of her things. SIL end up disrespecting girlfriend and starting a heated altercation with her. I don't condone SIL's behavior towards my brother's girlfriend. But I also don't see why she should be uninvited from a trip after she had already paid for her own ticket. Not to mention as my sister said, former SIL can just get a separate room. So am I wrong?

38,1e7bx3x,AITA for firing my sister as a sitter and telling her I won’t forgive her until she goes to rehab after she drank while babysitting?,"I (28f) have returned to work after maternity leave. Baby is first child, first grandchild, and first nephew/niece. Our initial childcare plans fell through and I was in desperate need of a sitter. I have a sister (32f) who lives with my parents and is unemployed. She knew I was looking for something and so she offered to babysit until we get something permanent. She struggles with mental health, alcohol, smoking cigarettes & marijuana, and she was diagnosed with GBS 4 years ago and still has some health issues. Due to this I was hesitant. Before agreeing I asked if she felt well enough to do it both physically and mentally, and if she was still drinking and smoking. She assured me she was in good health and that she was not smoking or drinking. The deal was she would come to my house to babysit and I would pay her.

I work close to home and I have a few cameras around my house so I could check in on them at any moment. I would come at lunch time to see them. When Friday rolled around, I stopped by earlier than usual (about 10:30am) without notice. That’s when I noticed a bottle of whiskey was significantly lower than previous. I immediately confronted her about it which she denied (no one except for myself and husband live in the home). I dismissed her and told her the following day we no longer needed her help. I later found out she told our other sister I falsely accused her of drinking our alcohol and she “can’t even reach that high” because of her physical ailments. The bottle was on top of our kitchen cabinets so she had to climb on the counters. I texted her after telling her I would not forgive her until she goes to rehab and gets help.

This week she had a therapy session and finally admitted to it. In her session she claims her therapist says I’m very controlling and that I can’t expect her to be perfect and that it was just a relapse. She says I’m using my child as a pawn and that her therapist says she doesn’t need rehab. Apparently she’s already taking naltrexone for her addiction. She tells me I need therapy. Everyone I know is on my side, but her therapist seems to disagree and my sister is shaming me for not forgiving her and telling her she needs rehab. So AITA?

She struggles with mental health, alcohol, smoking cigarettes & marijuana, and she was diagnosed with GBS 4 years ago and still has some health issues. Due to this I was hesitant. Before agreeing I asked if she felt well enough to do it both physically and mentally, and if she was still drinking and smoking. She assured me she was in good health and that she was not smoking or drinking. The deal was she would come to my house to babysit and I would pay her.

I work close to home and I have a few cameras around my house so I could check in on them at any moment. I would come at lunch time to see them. When Friday rolled around, I stopped by earlier than usual (about 10:30am) without notice. That’s when I noticed a bottle of whiskey was significantly lower than previous. I immediately confronted her about it which she denied (no one except for myself and husband live in the home). I dismissed her and told her the following day we no longer needed her help. I later found out she told our other sister I falsely accused her of drinking our alcohol and she “can’t even reach that high” because of her physical ailments. The bottle was on top of our kitchen cabinets so she had to climb on the counters. I texted her after telling her I would not forgive her until she goes to rehab and gets help.

This week she had a therapy session and finally admitted to it. In her session she claims her therapist says I’m very controlling and that I can’t expect her to be perfect and that it was just a relapse. She says I’m using my child as a pawn and that her therapist says she doesn’t need rehab. Apparently she’s already taking naltrexone for her addiction. She tells me I need therapy. Everyone I know is on my side, but her therapist seems to disagree and my sister is shaming me for not forgiving her and telling her she needs rehab. So AITA?

Edit: I have not spoken to her therapist. This is what my sister says her therapist said in her session.",0.0,0.024360131472349167,0,1
39,1e7btsw,AITAH if I don't want to be around these people anymore ,"I have been with my husband for ten years married for 6 years. About 7 months ago, tragedy struck our family. I lost my mom, and 2 days after after the passing of my mom my husband lost his auntie. And 1½month later my sister also passed away. My husband has this childhood friend that we always invited to our home for holidays, birthdays, parties anniversaries, dinner parties you name it and they are invited. They always come to party with us since they live about 20 ish minutes away from us. My husband's childhood friend and his wife have been aware of every tragedy and the only thing I got from them is a text saying sorry for your loss not once did they come to our home for a visit to check on us and see how we were doing. After weeks and months passed, and we never saw them, I told my husband that I no longer wanted to have any kind of relationship with them and they would no longer be invited to our home. He told me he understood Where I was coming from. and my points were valid, but now his friends keep telling him how he and his wife missed my cooking and ask when will he be invited to come over and have dinner with us. His wife also has been inviting me to go out with her. I always find a way to decline her invitation. Because as a friend if you can't be here for me in my time of need why would I want to be around you when things are good? Every time I declined an invitation to go out with her, my husband always makes it seem like I'm doing something wrong or I'm being mean for not going, or trying to sweet talk me into going out with her. Keep in mind these are the same people we always show up for whenever they help with anything. So am I the a hole?

EDIT 

For those of you saying YTA I would agree with you if I wasn't one of those people that goes over and beyond to be present for the people in my life.
I didn't even get a text asking if it was OK for them to come by and check up on us

Where I'm from when someone is sick or has someone passed away You show up and offer your services
A few days after my mom passed away They had a gender reveal party even though I couldn't be there physically. I was there virtually. 
When she gave birth I called to see if they needed anything I ended up cooking 2 different meals and showed up at the hospital with flowers and 1week worth of food.

It's Okay, to realize people don't value you the same way you value them. I'm just one of those people that don't care to build relationships with people who don't value me.

40,1e7b6bx,AITA for lying I’ve been socializing?,"So long story short, I've gone through bullying in 6th grade due to my personality. In 7th I tried doing what everyone else was doing but that also ended in bullying, so I decided that the best thing to do was to not talk at all.

I stayed quiet for an entire year, I lied to my parents that I was being social, even though I wasn't. My secret was intact til my teacher threw me under the bus...

All hell broke loose when I got home.

My parents yelled at me for how they felt like I slapped them in the face and what was wrong with me to act like a weirdo. They told me there just trying to keep me from turning into a shut-in and that I was acting like a child for not making an effort to talk. They figured the best thing to deal with my shyness is force me into social situations. They've been doing that ever since.

I understand what they're trying to do, but they just can't accept that I'm not social like them! My shyness only got worse from them putting me out there. Now I get so nervous my heart starts pounding, I feel like I wanna vomit, and I just mentally check out...

My parents have even gone as far as to sign me up for dance without me knowing. I feel backstabbed, kids there already labeled me as 'the weird girl who can't do anything' it's humiliating and nerve-wracking. I come back home so many times in a dazed state beacause I'm overwhelmed from all the fear. Yet I can't say anything or my parents will get mad.

But I still feel like a failure. I'm trying to be more social with fake confidence, but I always end up panicking and leaving. It's childish and I hate I'm putting my parents through the embarrassment of having me inside while the other kids are talking with one another. It's lazy.

My parents are good intentioned, but it's only making things worse...

I’ve known Jake for a long time and have had my suspicions. A few months ago, I did some digging and found out that his ""charity"" isn’t registered as a nonprofit. He has a website but its a regular company. I confronted him privately before the reunion, but he brushed me off, saying I didn’t understand how difficult it was to run a charity and that the paperwork was just delayed.

At the reunion I listened to him talk about all the good his charity was doing, I couldn’t take it anymore. I stood up and asked him to explain why it isn't registered after so long, and why there is no proof that he actually donated money. Jake tried to defend himself, and it was obviously very uncomfortable for him and embarrassing.

My mom refused and that was the end of the story. However, I asked her further why she didn’t want to go for sushi and she claims every time she eats things he buys that she “gets hurt” and she has a “bad feeling” about my bf. 
I must note that this isn’t true, since he buys dessert multiple times a week and she eats it whether or not she realizes he bought it and not my father. 
She claims that one time when he brought toffee she broke her tooth on it and another time she almost choked during a dinner that he took us out to. She constantly uses every opportunity to make fun of him or tear him down and now she is trying to tell me my bf is evil because of whatever superstitious stuff she believes in. He had also bought her very expensive chocolates a month ago for her birthday which I now realize she didn’t eat for the same reason. She ate like one or two pieces and confessed that she was “terrified” that he would be killing her with the chocolate. Wtf??

Now that brings me to right now. My bf brought some cake slices from a nearby bakery. She then decided she was going to eat it and I jumped out going no you’re not since you’re going to blame him for you choking again.

Last summer he used to rant to me all the time about her: how she didn’t send him a heart emoji before going to bed (??😭😭), how she was friendly with other people in our friend group and he acted as though they were in a relationship even calling himself her boyfriend at times.

Every single night he would text me about her and how he found her so hot and I would be like “say that to her not me bro”. At the time I was going through a rough breakup and wasn’t noticing how weird this all was.

One night he sent me a selfie of her that she had sent to him asking me if it would be wrong to j*** o** to it. Very weird and disgusting.

And he would just do all of these creepy little things that she had no idea of like drawing them naked and having her nickname be a literal p*** category.

Last night we all went out together and me and my other friend who knew about all of this just had to tell her. 

She was so hurt and surprised and she told us more things that we didn’t know about and she’s been feeling like crap the whole day.

He was there for me when I needed to vent but I value her friendship way more than I do his.

48,1e78714,WIBTA if I don't go to my friend's wedding? ,"A family friend of mine, let’s call her Kathy, is getting married in a few months. I’ll give a little background just so you understand the dynamic. Her parents and my parents have been friends since college and Kathy and I are the same age, so we basically grew up together. We were really close as kids and teenagers. As adults, we now live in different states so we aren’t as close as we used to be, but I still consider her a close friend because of our history. One of those friendships where we don’t see or talk to each other very often, but when we do get together it's like nothing ever changed. Our parents still regularly hang out and do things together on weekends. 

Anyways, I’m in a serious 5 year long relationship with my boyfriend. We’ve lived together for 4 out of 5 years, so we’re more or less a married couple without the status. We’ve also talked about getting engaged in the near future. Kathy (and the rest of her family) has met my boyfriend on several occasions. So I assumed it was a no brainer that he would be invited to the wedding. Well, I assumed wrong. We got the wedding invitation and it was addressed to my whole family - parents, sister, and myself. But my boyfriend’s name was nowhere on the invitation. It didn’t even say “plus one” or anything to include my boyfriend.

Kathy’s whole family knows damn well that I am in a serious relationship and the fact that he was not invited to the wedding feels rude and disrespectful. I am totally put off and debating not going to the wedding. I expressed this to my mom and she thinks I am over reacting. She made the excuse that it's “probably just a numbers thing” and not to take it personally. But in my opinion, it is personal. I’m not just an acquaintance, I’ve literally known Kathy and her family my whole life. And I’m not just casually dating someone, we’ve been together for 5 years. Kathy is essentially asking me to come celebrate her relationship while completely disregarding mine. Am I overreacting? And would I be the asshole if I skip Kathy’s wedding?

For some reason she has an obsession with leaving things in the kitchen sink. Our sink is really small, i mean 2 regular sized plates don't fit side by side because it's so small and we are 4 people living there.  I have told her multiple times not to do that, I get home every day from work to make lunch for the next day, and her mess is there, another roomie has to hand wash her uniform everyday since she's a chef, and her mess is there. The other day I stepped on dog poo and needed to wash and there was her mess there. Everytime it happens we send a message to the group about it and she says it's no big deal. 

Whenever I don't have time to wash, if I'm in a rush or something, I put my dirty dishes in my cupboard, and i suggested she do it too so she doesn't obstaculize the sink, she said ""ok"" and the next day...surprise surprise,  her mess was there.... so I grabbed her stuff and put it in her cupboard.  She didnt say anything about it. Last night, she came home took her tupperware out of her lunch box, left it in the sink and left to the gym. I had to make dinner and lunch, i was seasoning some meat and didnt want to get blood on  her tupper ware and again i put it in her cupboard.  When she came home she was upset that there were dirty dishes in her cupboard. 

I told her tough luck, i dont like dishes in the sink the same way she doesn't like dishes in her cupboard. And if thats a problem she can just wash it and put it in the right place,  like a considerate adult.

51,1e784do,WIBTA if I take away the playstation after my brother’s birthday?,"For context, this past Christmas I got a Playstation 5 as a gift from my father. So far, my family in the household has been using our shared Ps4. However, my brother’s birthday is coming up, and I agreed to let him borrow my console for a next gen game he wanted to play. But, what I unknowingly agreed to was allowing my bro unlimited access to my Playstation because it would move from my bedroom to the living room. 

He even received an extra controller from his dad, as I only had one. Basically, my console would become a free for all for my brother to use whenever he pleases. I don’t want that. I don’t want to sit idly, babysitting him during the summer as he uses my game. He’s an unclean kid under ten, and doesn't wash his dirty hands after eating or using the bathroom. Now, he’s already demanding I move my Playstation so he can play his game. Didn’t even ask. He already has my mom on his side. 

Would I be a jerk if I retake my console after he finishes his game even if I agreed to let him use it?

There is a girl, Mila (15) in the room next to her with an intestinal disorder. She's been here for about 3 weeks now. She always leaves her door open so she can talk to anyone hanging out by her room. 

I decided to start talking to her because I'd never seen her with a visitor and she's really a sweet kid. This is her 6th hospital stay since she got diagnosed around thanksgiving because her meds keep failing. The hospital is 2 hours away from her house and she's one of 5 kids so her mom isn't able to come more than once or twice a week and her dad hasn't visited at all. Over the next few days she'd call me into her room when she'd see me waiting in the hall and I just started going to her room when I couldn't be with my daughter. We talk, play cards/board games, and I run some small errands for her, like picking up her target order, washing her clothes, getting snacks, etc. 

Yesterday I was playing cards with her when her mom showed up. Mila introduced me to her and her mom asked why I was in her kid's room. I explained that my daughter is the room next door and whenever she needs some space, I spend time with Mila since she spends so much of her time alone.

Well, Mila's mom was pissed with the nurses for letting some random woman in her kid's room and with me for ""criticizing her parenting"" (all I said is that she spends a lot of time alone in her room). Apparently Mila is autistic and that meant she wasn't capable of inviting me into her room (I had no clue she was autistic) and that me going in there makes me a predator. 

I told my husband about this and he agrees that she's overreacting but he thinks I shouldn't be in a random kid's room.

The past months, my parents have been arguing about money at least once a month. Everyone in the family is well aware of it. Me and my youngest sibling (F15) have been saving money so we won't be asking them too much for our liesures. However, we (me and F15)both noticed that our sister (F20) have been frequently asking for money (town travel & going out with friends). I (F22) told my sister (F20) that she's been asking for money too frequently from my parents and it sparked into an argument. I said that Im merely pointing it out, but she (F20) claims that we are attacking her. She (F20) also told us the things she says to her classmates that asked about her spending habits.

56,1e77393,AITA for not telling boyfriend I downloaded Bumble BFF to make friends?,"Me (M) and my boyfriend (M) have been in a relationship for 4 years. He has more friends than me and hangs out with people more often. I don't have many close friends and end up hanging with his most of the time.

He has told me multiple times that I should make more friends, especially now that we have moved to a nearby town further away from friends. He has brought up Bumble BFF to me during these conversations, telling me that two of his friends (gay couple) have used it and found good friends on the app that they still hang out with.

He brought up using Bumble BFF before we moved as he thought he would be lonely in the new town and he would need people to hang out with. One day, I downloaded the app, got to the create profile screen, became exhausted over using an app to make friends, and never touched it again.

Recently after moving, we got into a huge argument because he mentioned Bumble BFF again after we had hung out with some locals and he said they were not his vibe. He said Bumble BFF would be better for finding friends. I then told him that I had downloaded the app but hadn't used it.

He got furious and started asking me if I had his permission to use it and why I had not told him about it. He claimed that guys on there would start to be friends and then become flirty and start sending you nudes. And then he said his friends who use it have ground rules on how they use the app because of this.

I tried explaining that I had downloaded it because he had brought it to my attention multiple times throughout the months and that I hadn't even gone past the profile creation step. He never told me we needed to have rules or that I needed to tell him about the app since he was the one to tell me about it. I felt he was jealous of me with other guys who may end up liking me. I had previously been honest with him when guys we met in gay bars have sent me flirty messages on IG. I've shown him the messages so he could be at ease that I have never flirted back to lead anyone on.

Despite this, he kept telling me that I was wrong for downloading it and that I still hadn't apologized to him for doing so and not caring about his feelings. He said my ego was too big and only cared about myself.

I agreed that I should have discussed me downloading the app but I didn't of doing so because 1) he told me to do so various times and 2)I hadn't used it. I told him I could apologize for not communicating with him and for hurting his feelings but that I couldn't apologize for downloading the app and not discussing rules.

Bumble BFF is now a completely separate app so I also didn't think it was necessary to get his permission. I told him that it was installed for months on my phone and not once have I hidden it from him as he often uses my phone and could have seen the logo.

60,1e76hsw,AITA because I didn't think I had to clean the hair from the shower,"My (37F) husband (30M) and I have been married for a 1.5 years. He has been an amazing husband and step father until now. He has two kids from a prior relationship. Their mother doesn't work and he is stuck paying the max for child support (40%). He doesn't make much and when we met he was living with his parents and renting a room form them. I was in the middle of a divorce. We eventually decided to get married and buy a house together. I used the money from my divorce settlement to put a down payment down. I knew he didn't have money to contribute to the mortgage so I told him I would pay all the bills, handle the cooking, dishes, and laundry and scrub the toilets and he could do the rest of the chores. He agreed. 
Last night he complained that our shower needed cleaning. I said I would clean it but that it is a bit clogged so the water drains slowly. I have long hair and I'm sure that is the issue. I asked him to use the tool we have to clean the hair and I would clean the shower. He said it was disrespectful that there was hair in the shower and that I should clean it since it was my mess. He also implied that I was lazy (his exact words were ""if someone wasn't so lazy...""). I asked how it was any different than him leaving his dirty plates on the counter for me to wash since that was his mess and I never complained about cleaning it.  I said that we had a deal about who would do what and I didn't understand why he was upset now. I pay the mortgage, the utilities, the HOA fees, the groceries, buy him clothes is he needs them. I never ask him for money for anything and I make sure our joint account has money in case he wants to grab some food (I do pack him lunches but sometimes he is still hungry) or if he needs something. We both work and I have a high stress executive level job making twice his pay before child support. He has a manual labor job and doesn't make much after child support and taxes. 
I feel like I am already contributing more than my share to the household and I shouldn't be considered disrespectful or lazy for not cleaning some hair from a drain. He has always been a sweet, caring man to both me and my kids and I just can't get over how this made me feel. My ex was horrible and often called me lazy deposit him doing no housework or childcare at all. This seems to have triggered something for me. He has apologized but also said I was making this a bigger deal than it was and being dramatic. I can't seem to let it go. AITA for thinking that I contribute enough as it is?

dont have enough room and i dont trust this man or her anymore. their solution to this is to have a baby and live on welfare. when she told me this i gave her the biggest reality check i told her that welfare isnt even that easy to get on and that it wont cover the costs of raising a child and that she is lazy and needs to get a job and stop chasing after scummy men and that whatever poor child she has is going to have a horrible life as i know she can not raise a kid properly last time we talked was a week after this argument where she texted me asking for money which i refused to give to her because it would not be spent on anything good and i would definitely not get it paid back despite her promises to pay it. im pretty sure she is really mad at me because every time she talks to me she is making horrible decisions and i just blow up about it to her. aita should i just let her be and trust she will be fine or just dont do anything about it i guess its not my problem to fix.",0.0,0.49811363220214844,0,1
63,1e75pzy,AITA for telling my cousin it's not her birthday so she needs to get over it?,"Recently my aunt and her kids came down for my Nan's birthday 1 of her kids 8 (F) had a birthday in June at the end of June really now when I 21 (F) went around to say hello since the last time we saw them was Christmas my cousin kept asking about her birthday present. Now I just thought being a little kid of course she's going to think that she's going to get presents. Now I had a joke with her telling her that there is no present for her and that it's our nan's birthday now.

She dropped it for a while went back to colouring and eating her dinner before I had to run out to the car she decided to follow.

Now this is where I might be the AITA.

On our way to the car she kept going on and on asking if I was going to get her birthday present, if she had a birthday present, why she hadn't received a birthday present.

Now I grew up in a family that if you don't expect anything you won't be disappointed but I felt so frustrated that I turned around and said ""your birthday was last month there is no birthday present you need to get over it and grow up"" the look on her face made me realise I hurt her but again I didn't want her to think or grow up thinking that just because it was your birthday or past your birthday you should get a present. 

She ran inside all upset and told on me saying how I was rude and told her that it wasn't her birthday so most of the adults were looking at me nobody said anything but I just knew they were disappointed in me for going off at a 8 year old. But I didn't know how else to go about it she is 8 I didn't want her to turn into a spoiled brat thinking that she should expect a gift everytime she sees someone.

For context: I never said her birthday wasn't important I just wanted to get through to her that it's past her birthday and she needs to understand she's not going to get a gift everytime.

And my mums side of the family are people that relight the candles and let there kids blow them out just so they don't get upset and throw a tantrum. (My mum doesn't agree with that since kids spit but all her siblings who have kids think it's a good way to prevent crying) 

Just a side note: nobody else had gifts for my cousin all the gifts were for my nan, my cousin just expects everything is for her including things that aren't for her. She's very spoiled her parents have never said no to her.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-19,"AITA for telling my cousin it's not her birthday so she needs to get over it?

So queue me walking in, getting my things, etc. Upon me going to check out, I hear a lady talking to the cashier. Here's how that dialoque went 
Random lady: ""why are the bathrooms closed?!""

Cashier: ""they're closed right now so we can deep clean them""

Cashier: "" Ma'am can you refrain from that language please?""

Random lady: ""fuck you bitch, go fo your damn job!""

66,1e751op,AITA for comparing a guy (20M) to my (18F) baby brother (16M)?,"A while ago me and my girl friends went out and met a group of guys who we used to hang with a few years ago but not anymore. One is an ex of my best friend and who this is about. They were together a few months years ago (she was 15-16 I think he was like 18) he never liked me for some reason even though we rarely spoke.

On my side it’s genuine indifference while his seemed to be actual dislike. I only spoke to him if my friend was involved like telling him where she was/if she finished class. Even others told him to chill and that it’s odd how he acts because I never talk about him. I was 14-15 at the time so it’s weird he was 18 beefing with a kid and is still mad but idc 

Fast forward to now, the topic of cleaning came up. I said that in my family we clean our home every 2 weeks (wash the floors, clean everything.really get in there) each of us kids wash the floors of & clean our rooms, when done we help my mom clean the balcony & the rest of our apartment. My dad helps but he has heart problems and can’t exhaust himself too much. My friends know my little brother so they asked if he helps or just sits while me and my baby sister (13f) do everything and I said no my mom makes us all clean.

The ex said it’s dumb, that his mom never made him clean  and that she just hired a cleaner or did it herself. I said that not everyone have money for a cleaner (his family’s kinda rich. Mine’s middle class) and my brother knows it’s helping mom and I know it’s not very common for boys my brother’s age to get up and clean but mine does and he’s a clean boy in general. He showers daily, isn’t stinky, his room is fairly clean except for a few empty bottles and snacks which is actually normal.

After I insisted that it’s normal for my brother to clean and he also doesn’t mind the ex started calling him names, idk the translation from my language but it’s like calling a boy a chick/wuss and similar stuff. I got protective of my brother and told the ex if he thinks that my brother being clean makes him a chick then it’s embarrassing for him then listed what I said above about my brother being fairly clean compared to other boys his age + the ex. I also said that he’s embarrassing for always having beef with kids at his big age (he used to talk crazy about me when he was 18 and I was 15ish) that he basically admits that a 16 year old boy is cleaner than him which is embarrassing too. I added that my “chick” brother is not only cleaner but girls actually like him, a girl even came to him and flirted with him too and isn’t struggling unlike ex bf so if anything he should go get advice from the chick (my brother).

Ex got mad, said I’m dumb for calling him dirty and that my little brother is doing better than him and that my kind (I’m black) isn’t the same. I said my little brother *is* better than him.

I (16F), and my sister (18F), have always had a rocky relationship. Not for any particular reason but because of her grudges. My sister, who i’ll call anna for the sake of the story, is a completely normal person with no psychological problems what so ever (atleast for what I know) Anna tends to get mad over small things that have no significance what so ever and will not talk to me or my brother (21) for months, even years on end. The longest she has gone not talking to me or my brother was for 5 years, from when I think I was 8-13 years old. The reason? I have no idea, she wouldn’t tell us. For some background, my mom died 2 years ago, as her and my father were divorced since I was about 7. Also my brother and I were and still are very close. After that 5 year period, Anna came to me crying after my mothers death and apologized for all the years she went without talking to me and my brother. I forgave her as I was young, at the same and went on my life. The three of us slowly started mending our relationship with one another until anna started up with her grudges again. It started off small, she would get mad at me or my brother and not talk to us for a couple of weeks, then weeks turned into months, and now currently she is still mad at me and my brother for about a year now. She is mad at me because I wouldn’t let her practice braiding on my hair. So childish, I know.

Now, as of today, Anna is leaving for college out of state in a few weeks and I made a remark in front of my dad saying how the house isn’t going to feel any different because she doesn’t speak for anyone anyways.

69,1e73jbc,AITA for fighting with my mother's husband over me not cleaning the house and potentially causing their divorce?,"I (30F), am currently living in a shared space with my mom (54F) and her husband (49M) after running into some medical troubles and no longer being able to afford to live on my own, and before anyone says anything, yes I am paying rent/bills to live here. The issues started between me and her husband a few months after I moved in with him taking every opportunity he could to ""talk to himself"" about how I'm such a lazy fuck, how it ""must be nice"" that I'm stuck at home while I'm on medical leave from work, how I'm faking my chronic illness flair ups to get away with doing nothing and just generally complaining about my existence any time I wasn't in my room. So, I started spending all my time in my room unless my mom was home and only coming out to talk to her when she got back from work or updating her on my medical stuff.

Apparently, her husband has an issue with that as well. He gets mad whenever we talk and just generally acts like a jealous boyfriend and that I'm trying to steal his girl away as if she isn't my mother. To try and keep things brief, it's essentially gotten to the point where I can't even leave my room without him starting something or finding issue over it and finds even more issue in the fact that I don't leave my room because he expects me to play cinderella and clean up after his messes everyday and cook dinner for them every night despite the fact that I cannot stand or walk more than 20 minutes at a time without immense pain and have doctors orders that I can't so most of what he demands of me because I end up hurting myself more and prolonging my injury.

 I'm not sure how I'm supposed to ""do more"" when I'm on restrictions of what I can do after suffering a back injury that I have already had to get 3 surgeries for and am waiting for more of. It's already frustrating feeling like a prisoner in my own body and being stuck living somewhere I don't even want to be, but, here is where I might be the asshole.

I ended up getting into a screaming match with her husband after he came home acting like a toddler, IE slamming doors/cabinets, stomping around, throwing things, and loudly talking shit about me because I didn't clean the house after getting home from another round of spine injections to try and manage the swelling. A lot of things were said and my mom came home and they ended up getting into a huge fight that went on for 3 more days and now my mom is saying she threatened divorce and that she'll lose the house without his job to pay for it and I just really don't know what to do. I'll admit there are some things I can do to help clean that I've stopped doing out of spite because he talks shit regardless if I do it or not, and while I would have no issue cooking for my mom, I have no desire to cook for someone who treats me like shit for things I can't control even if I know my refusal isn't helping the problem. I don't want my mom to suffer because of me. So AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-19,"AITA for fighting with my mother's husband over me not cleaning the house and potentially causing their divorce? I (30F), am currently living in a shared space with my mom (54F) and her husband (49M) after running into some medical troubles and no longer being able to afford to live on my own, and before anyone says anything, yes I am paying rent/bills to live here. The issues started between me and her husband a few months after I moved in with him taking every opportunity he could to ""talk to himself"" about how I'm such a lazy fuck, how it ""must be nice"" that I'm stuck at home while I'm on medical leave from work, how I'm faking my chronic illness flair ups to get away with doing nothing and just generally complaining about my existence any time I wasn't in my room. So, I started spending all my time in my room unless my mom was home and only coming out to talk to her when she got back from work or updating her on my medical stuff.

Apparently, her husband has an issue with that as well. He gets mad whenever we talk and just generally acts like a jealous boyfriend and that I'm trying to steal his girl away as if she isn't my mother. To try and keep things brief, it's essentially gotten to the point where I can't even leave my room without him starting something or finding issue over it and finds even more issue in the fact that I don't leave my room because he expects me to play cinderella and clean up after his messes everyday and cook dinner for them every night despite the fact that I cannot stand or walk more than 20 minutes at a time without immense pain and have doctors orders that I can't so most of what he demands of me because I end up hurting myself more and prolonging my injury.

 I'm not sure how I'm supposed to ""do more"" when I'm on restrictions of what I can do after suffering a back injury that I have already had to get 3 surgeries for and am waiting for more of. It's already frustrating feeling like a prisoner in my own body and being stuck living somewhere I don't even want to be, but, here is where I might be the asshole.

70,1e73h2x,AITA for leaving after my SIL called me clingy?,"I (24F) had been visiting my aunt's place for a wedding, who lives a few hours away from me. She has two boys (30,27M), and the both of them are married to two beautiful and intelligent women.

I met them only recently and I have not hung out with them a lot. I always wanted older brothers since I only have an older sister. Although, I acknowledge that this was not their responsibility. My aunt loves me a lot, though. I asked her if I could stay at their place for a couple days more.

At night, both of my cousins were with their wives, and I was helping my aunt with the dinner. She asked me to call all of them downstairs. When I went to the room, I heard my older SIL say, ""Ugh, when is (my name) leaving? I don't know why she is so clingy. She annoyed us throughout the wedding and meddles in our family so much."" My cousins just lightly laughed along, I'm unsure if they found humour in her words or was it awkward laughter. 

My cousin saw me in the doorway and it looked like he had seen a ghost. I just said ""Please come downstairs, dinner's ready."" He stopped me and asked me if I heard her. I just gave him a smile and said while holding tears back, ""I did, but its okay because she can have her opinion. It's okay if she doesn't like me. I did not take it into consideration that you guys are on a hectic schedule and forced myself here. I'll do better."" He apologized to me on her behalf, and she apologised as well, saying she was just stressed about the busy schedule and packing although I had been doing chores for them all day to not be dead weight.

After the dinner, they tried to talk to me, but I avoided them, and called a friend. I talked to him, just trying to calm myself down bc my feelings will really hurt and I felt unwanted.

In the morning, I packed my bags early and told my aunt I'm going to visit a friend in the city, then I have a flight late in the evening to go back home ASAP for work. My aunt was surprised and ask me to wait until my cousins wake up before I go, but I told her I had said my goodbyes last night already.

After seeing my friend, I just went to the airport a few hours early and sat in the lounge until it was time to go. My sister and I have shared GPS locations for safety purposes, and I forgot that she can see me being at the airport a couple days earlier than planned. I told her everything. When I got off the flight, I had missed calls and texts from my aunt and my cousins. 

Apparently, my sister told my mom what went down, and she was too unhappy. She then called my aunt and asked her about this, and found out that she was unaware of it all. My cousins had played it cool. 

Long story short, my aunt and my uncle are super upset with my SIL. My SIL feels like I made an immature and rash decision, and made her look bad in front of the entire family. I could have given them a chance the next day to fix things, but I threw them all under the bus. AITA?

This morning my husband was doing his morning routine and his “apple knife”(the only knife he will use for his apples) was used and we couldn’t find it.

He began saying that no other knife will cut his apple the way he wants it cut and he’s used to that knife and that he has to search around the house for a new knife and now is routine is out of whack and that “he knows I don’t have a routine at all or anything like that”. (Mind you im a SAHM to a 1.5 year old and yes I used to have a routine but now i have a child that comes before me and my routine) I said the knifes in the dishwasher are clean that is not even 2 feet from your knifes original place you don’t need to search for anything so stop being rude. Then i brought up AGAIN how I wasn’t the one who used his knife because I know how how he is and I had no idea that she had used it until this very second. And i said “so im sorry but she didnt know”. He proceeded to pick at me and say well you need to tell her so she knows for next time. And I said do you really think my mother is going to remember a knife at our house to not use? No she has trouble remembering daily so why would u think she would remember someone elses items? And unfortunately i wasnt there to catch it and clean it and put it back for you. Then he said oh your just sticking up for your mom. (All this was happening while my mother in law was here and in the other room with our daughter) I said I really dont want to discuss this now can we please just not.

73,1e72v5r,WIBTA to ask bridesmaid who backed out last minute to pay for two dresses or not come to the wedding ,"I get married in two months. I generally get on best with men so I was going to have two bridesmaids and some brides men too. 

I really didn’t want to create a power dynamic between the girls (let’s call them Jennifer and Linda) so I (in hindsight foolishly) didn’t pick a MOH at first. One of my bridesmaids, Linda was becoming very over involved and not really listening to my ideas or what o wanted. We only booked the wedding a month ago, but Linda and Jennifer were in the loop with ideas for a while. 

In the end I decided on Jenifer as my MOH and also decided to involve my two sister in laws to be (also maid numbers with groomsmen more equal, and I felt it may reduce competition between the two girls. 

Things have been running great and my MOH has been planning my hen, with Linda helping (as far as I understood) 

I recently had to order bridesmaids dresses from Etsy, which were non returnable. Linda had been really lacking in communication….and I was a bit worried as she’s out on weight with sizing. So I ordered two sizes for her as she is a mother and I presumed she was busy with kids, and I was happy to have one spare dress. I’m also not having any plus ones (unless I’m friends with them too) to the ceremony. Linda persuaded me to have an extra guest as her plus one who was an old friend….i mainly invited this person as she said he would be able to provide childcare night before where i will be having a bridal blessing at the sight (it’s a camping wedding) 

Linda has now messaged me saying she has a lot on and can no longer be a bridesmaid. This is not the end of the world, however her ghosting prior led to me spending over £90 which I can’t really afford on dresses for her. There’s an extra guest (costing us money) because she required it to come. She’s also tried to dictate another guest she didn’t want to come, and I strongly suspect her reasons for declining now is she didn’t feel she was involved enough/ felt slighted to not be MOH. 

WIBTAH to ask her to cover the dresses I got? Tbh, as it stands I don’t want her or her ‘plus 1’ friend to come at all anymore, given some inputs she’s had and comments she’s made. Note she also earns about 5 times what I do and has suggested she would spend £200 on a dress if she got her own.. 

Edit

She did agree on the dresses. She also agreed she would pay for her bridesmaid dress before I ordered these. I also told her o needed to order them immenemtly due to a sale ending. I had asked for a £30 contribution, and she actually offered to me she would pay the full amount or I would never have ordered them. Should have added this in post.

Then she stopped talking to us and in recent get togethers she has giving me dirty looks and even during my bf birthday party cussed me out.

77,1e71e0i,AITA for holding a grudge?,"My father-in-law (in his late 70's) has always been judgmental about people gaining weight. He constantly comments if anyone in the family puts on a few pounds, even though his own weight fluctuates. He frequently skips meals even though it makes him grumpy and tired. The day after my son was born, he asked me why I ""still looked pregnant."" When my daughter was a toddler and carrying normal baby weight, he expressed concern with her ""fat legs."" He even talks about how animals at the zoo are ""too fat"" and should go on a diet! I made clear years ago that I would not respond well to any comments about my weight or my kids'. I have struggled to keep weight off as I get older (I am in my late 40s) and currently am overweight. 

Two days ago we were vacationing at the beach as a family and talked about going to get ice cream.

79,1e70yoj,AITA for the makeup artist walking off as I was difficult and refusing to cover some of the cost of the MUA?,"


I 26F am a bridesmaid for my friend college Lily. She wasn’t really involved in planning the wedding, leaving it to her MOH Anna apart from choosing the venue and dress.

Anna picked a local makeup artist and she experience doing the look that Lily and Anna had decided on. I first met her at the rehearsal dinner and she did Lily’s and all the bridesmaids’ makeup. The makeup had lasted for most people, however on me it looked awful by the end of the night- the foundation had separated in places and it highlighted my texture. 

When she came around to do the makeup for the wedding, I asked her if she would mind me doing my skin prep before she puts the makeup on, and she said she did her own skin prep and she didn’t want to deviate from the look Anna asked her to recreate. I mentioned how my makeup had looked at the end of the rehearsal and that I could do my own makeup instead and she told Anna. I repeated the same information to Anna and said that I wouldn’t mind doing my own makeup, but Anna insisted that the makeup looks for us should be cohesive and just work with the MUA. Anna was quite busy so I left her alone.

When it came to my turn for the makeup, the skin prep she was talking about was was a makeup wipe and a facial mist. I asked her if I could use my moisturiser and she said no it might not work with the foundation she was using on us and when I said she could use my foundation she said no it was her professional reputation on the line so she felt more comfortable using her products. 

We were just going around in circles and she wasn’t compromising on anything. One of the other bridesmaids came in and when I explained the situation to her the MUA got pissed and walked off because she felt I was now ganging up on her.

She had done everyone’s makeup barring mine and Anna’s at this point and Anna called me difficult and I told her I had tried my best to work with the MUA and the other bridesmaid backed me up. Anna got upset as we were in a foreign place where she knew no one last minute to help with hair as the MUA had left and Anna and me didn’t have our makeup done. 

Some of the other bridesmaids tried to placate the MUA, but couldn’t find her and we found out later she had just left. We all did our own hair and one of the other bridesmaids did Anna’s makeup. Anna didn’t talk to me for the rest of the day and has sent me a text requesting me to cover some of the cost with the MUA, as she is still charging for transport and the hourly rate of the work she did do on the day. 

Lily is on her honeymoon so I don’t want to bother her with this but I genuinely don’t believe I should be responsible for the makeup costs. I feel awful that on the day she walked out and I gave countless apologies, but I tried to stand my ground about the makeup and now am getting called difficult.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-19,"AITA for the makeup artist walking off as I was difficult and refusing to cover some of the cost of the MUA?

81,1e70d53,AITA for constantly bringing up flaws in my (F18) friendship with my guy bestfriend (M18)?,"
To give you some context, the bestfriend and i have been friends for over three years. We lost contact during the pandemic and reconnected at school after. We were super close and only drifted due to a toxic boyfriend at the time. Reconnecting felt like gaining a part of my life back.

We became super close again and life was good for a while. But after a few months, my other friends came up to me and decided to let me in on a secret. They told me that he was in love with me and that he was never going to tell me about it. I was shocked and confronted him about it, since I never saw it as anything other than a platonic friendship. He confessed to it and told me that he was waiting for me to notice him, all while I was dating someone at the time. I politely rejected him, saying that he is an amazing person and that I never saw him as anything more than a friend. I asked if he was okay with still being friends, because he was my closest companion and I couldn't fathom losing him. He was completely okay with it.

A few weeks pass and he started to get distant and, frankly, disrespectful. Any attempt at a conversation would just be insults concealed as jokes and hurtful comments if i ""didnt get the joke"", calling me overly sensitive and that ""i didnt respond like the other girls did"". I started to bring up my issues with his behaviour but nothing changed after the fact. He only became more disrespectful and never apologising. The last time i brought this up was a week ago, and he acted as if i was hurting him by constantly telling him how i felt. He says that i need to let go of the past and that he wont apologize for things that he didnt recognize as wrong. AITA for taking his jokes too seriously?

84,1e6zlhz,"AITA for not getting my niece a ""fun"" birthday gift? ","I (25F) have two nieces and one nephew from my sister (40F). My oldest niece and nephew are twins (14), my younger niece is 6 years old.

They're all great kids, and I've sort of been like an older sister to them since there's a huge age gap between me and my older sister. The twins had their birthday last week, and I brought presents for all of them, yes even the 6 year old cause she's very young and I don't want her to feel left out. However the gift giving didn't go as well as planned.

My nephew loved Hotwheels when he was younger, my youngest niece has always been asking for a barbie doll, so they were easy people to buy presents for.  I got my nephew a remote control car, my younger niece a barbie doll. My oldest niece however was a bit of a wildcard. She never had any stereotypical girly interests as a young girl, she was already pretty shy and liked keeping to herself around guests or people she didn't know that well. I know she liked watching space documentaries once upon a time but that seemed so long ago and I don't think she watches it anymore. At the time of buying my mind was blank and that was my only kind of reference for her interests. So I got her a space encyclopedia.

When I gave the gifts, my oldest niece was disappointed, she started saying that her present is not as fun as the ones her siblings got. The twins had some of their friends over at their party and after they left my niece ran to her room, crying about how humiliated she was, and how unfair that her twin brother got a fun present and she got a boring book to study with that made her look like a nerd, and even her younger sister got a better present and it wasn't even her birthday.

Her parents got really angry with her throwing a tantrum and told her to appreciate the things she was given and to not make me feel bad. I really tried to be the bigger person and told her that I remembered how she liked space documentaries and that was why I got it for her, and then she screamed at me saying that she did that when she was ""freaking 10"" (her words) and that she's a teenager now and she doesn't like that anymore. I said ""well you don't have to be so ungrateful about it, that encyclopedia I got you was nearly 300 bucks. Its not like its not useful."" My sis and BIL said the same thing but she was miserable. Its been a week and I don't know what else I could have done. I didnt want to have to go and ask about a bday gift that was meant to be a surprise, I didnt think she'd take it this badly. AITA?

I decided to call him one day cause I was thinking about the wedding and my lack of interest in going - I said to him (note as far as I’m aware the wedding budget is about 40-55k) that I would be happy to come to the ceremony to be a witness and see the main attraction but I wouldn’t be going to the reception - I’ve said to him in the past refer to ** and how I wouldn’t want them to spend money on a spot for me and to put it on the bar tab or something else cause I don’t want them to waste time/effort/money on me when I would most likely pull an Irish exit. 

He asked a couple questions mainly being ‘even if it’s for his wedding?’ And ‘I want you to meet all of the people who’re special to me’ (I’ve met the fiancés family they’re nice people).

87,1e6z9h5,WIBTA for not inviting a friend's partner to my wedding?,"I have a good group of friends consisting of 8 people, both men and women, in the city where I live. In the eight, there is one couple, me and my fiancé, and four other friends: Alex, Claire, Dan, and Emil. One of these friends, Alex, began dating someone and living with someone who is an introvert, Beth.

We were very happy for Alex when the relationship began, because he is happy! And at first Beth came out to group birthday parties or big celebrations. But after the first year they were together, her attendance stopped. I wrote to Beth to specifically invite her to our next gathering, and she wrote a very sweet, and very polite, decline. She prefers to spend it by herself or with her own friends and family. I want to stress that she was really nice in her tone and said she appreciated the invite.

Me and other friends in this group, of course we are a bit disappointed because a) we miss out the opportunity to make a new friend in Beth and b) we see Alex much less as a natural result of this.

So here is my own selfish dilemma- me and my fiancé are going to get married. We will have one wedding in another country for my relatives to attend, and this one will be rather big and party-like, so anyone who can make it to that, I'm all for! But we will also have one wedding in the city where we live, so more of my fiancé's family can attend. This will be much smaller, and I really want it to be people who care about us and will be happy for us there.

Emil is single, and Claire and Dan have partners- we've spent a lot of time and even had trips with these partners. Beth is the exception. We are planning to invite Claire and Dan's partners to the city wedding, because my fiancé and I have spent time with them. I am worried both Beth and Alex will be offended if I invite only Alex, but we have not spent any time with Beth (at her request).

Would I be the asshole if I were to invite Alex, but not Beth, to the city wedding?

  
UPDATE:

The responses have encouraged me to bring it up with Alex. Doesn't have to be today or anything (we aren't anywhere near sending out invites yet), but it crossed my mind because I saw him recently. I don't want to cause conflict with him, he's a cool dude that I have known for 7 years. But I also don't want to feel resentful that there's someone present at a special moment for me and my partner, who is only there out of obligation to Alex- someone who doesn't want to know us -when that space could be used for someone who does know us.",Asshole,2024-07-19,"WIBTA for not inviting a friend's partner to my wedding?

I asked him what was wrong and he said through tears “I don’t like it, it’s too big and I’m so small” so I ended the video and changed to a craft.

It’s been a few weeks and he still says that the planets are scary and he’s too small.

I tried to help him look at it from a different way but he seems stuck on the fact that there are things so big we can’t even really understand them.

90,1e6xm1n,AITA for not telling my friend about where I'm applying to?,"We've been friends for 4 years since college and flatmates for the past year. Last week, she had a competition where I went to support her. Unfortunately, the team lost the finals and came in 2nd. I hadn't planned on drinking, but everyone started to, so I did too. I've never been blackout drunk and have only drunk 8 times in my life.

That night, I had too many drinks (a mix of 5 glasses of wine, 3 glasses of whiskey, and 2/3 beer) as I started to converse with people. I don't remember much after I blacked out.

The next morning, my friend started screaming at me about my actions the previous night. She said I embarrassed her by talking unhinged to a teacher, taking a cigarette inside the canteen where people were having dinner, and needing to be taken out. On the cab ride home, they had to take care of me instead of having a team meeting to discuss the loss.

She also called me secretly competitive because I met someone I've known for 8 years who offered me an internship at the place she wanted to go (the competition's winner would secure an internship there). She said I broke her principle of friendship by not informing her and ""attacking her territory."" I understand I am very competitive. I am desperate to get out of the financial rut and support my family as soon as I graduate.

I acknowledge and am deeply ashamed of my behavior that night. I have always extended myself beyond my means to support her: cooking for her before competitions, cleaning the house, listening to her rant, and making sure she's not pressured by anything. I've been very supportive every time except that one night under alcohol. I won't use alcohol as an excuse because I did choose to drink it.

She said she didn't want to be friends when I begged her for forgiveness. She said hurtful things, bringing up issues I shared with her in vulnerable situations. She weaponized my own issues against me. She also tried to sabotage my relationship with another close friend, and I had to sit them together to tell the third girl my POV and found out she's been spreading lies about me.

I don't know what to do or say. She is very important to me but I am also very private about sharing my applications. I don't mean malice or wish to win at her cost. It's a level playing field, and no one's name is written over opportunities. I cannot sustain a friendship based on an obligation to inform her of my applications.

I was totally wrong. I was 14 and since learned from it. This is about new labels she’s put on it years later*)

we are both 18 and have been dating for 4 years and she’s only ever claimed to be anything other than straight since last week. well about 3 years ago i believe she told me she had a “girl crush” on a girl in 5th grade and that she still thinks about it. i didn’t take it seriously because, admittedly, at 15 it was normal for me for straight women to be overly flirtatious with their friends or have a higher interest in the same sex compared to men.

so then here’s the issue: i then made a joke about said girl crush in front of her family when we were all poking fun at each other in a similar fashion. so she goes “i only said she was pretty” so i said “nah that’s not what it seemed like” and then that was that. she tells me her mom asked about the girl crush (which didn’t seem like an issue at the time) because of the joke later on but when she told me about it at the time it seemed lighthearted. she was upset at me for making the joke right after i made it but it was never because i “outed” her but because i said too much of her personal business which i understood…

…until today (a week after she tells me she might like girls more seriously she previously thought) when she randomly brings up “hey remember when you outed me lol” to which i protest that i outed her at all because not only did i not know at the time, her family didn’t know, and she had given me trouble for coming out to her personally because she couldn’t wrap her head around her partner being attracted to people unlike her, i.e. the same sex. its even more difficult for me to accept calling it that because last week when she told me she might be interested in women, she said “no i don’t like labels” when i asked if she was bi or pan or lesbian. so if you’re going to not only cry and accuse me of things when i come out to you, call yourself straight for years, and then claim to not like labels, why are we all the sudden now trying to use LGBTQ terminology to make ourselves the victim? she didn’t understand that “outing” is a label too and an LGBTQ term for something very specific when given the right context. her issue with me is that I keep claiming it’s not outing her, *i’ve never once said the joke was right to make or that it’s justified because i’ve apologized so much over the last 3 years but why bring it up now out of nowhere just to put labels on it?* this is the same woman who, prior to this, let her best friend and her boyfriend trash talk me when she told them i was bi and let me still hang out with them, so why are we trying to save face?",Asshole,2024-07-19,"AITA for not apologizing for “outing” my gf, although she claims I did?

92,1e6xeub,WIBTA if I set down hard rules for my Father in Law who lives with me? ,"I (34f) am married to DH(38m) for seven years, and three years ago my FiL(84m) moved into our apartment with us.

I made a whole separate rant post with more details but I'll summarize as best as I can for context:

FiL has progressively become a handful since moving in, has destroyed the room and most of the furniture. He's become combative and thinks that we shouldn't be able to tell him to take care of himself or the room. He's medically unable to take care of himself and cannot live independently. He doesn't understand his meds or how they work and will ignore you if you try to explain.

He's been refusing to shower often (maybe once a week if we're lucky) and only changes his clothes every four days because ""He doesn't sweat and can't smell it so he doesn't smell."" The room reeks. He does smell and it is VERY strong.

I am having to check his room for trash and tape and random plastic that he leaves everywhere on the ground as he doesn't clean his messes. When he first moved in we established that he could NOT leave stuff laying around like that because we have cats and he said he wouldn't but has never actually tried to keep it out of their reach.

He has fished things out of the trash (containers mostly that he doesn't use) and hides them under his bed and I'm honestly so fed up. I will not live in a small apartment with a trash hoarding goblin man who won't bathe because he's lazy and not for any medical reasons. He DOES NOT have dementia and appears to be very lucid when he wants to be.

On Saturday we're deep cleaning his room because the smell is starting to drift into other parts of the apartment and I'm at my limit. I told my husband that I am in fact throwing away the trash and the trashed lamps/shelf that he destroyed. At this point they are also unsafe because of all the 'modifications' he's made to them.

We already ordered a new lamp and a shelf that we're gluing together so he can't pull it apart. I'm not really going to be asking if I can change these as I genuinely think the lamp is 100% a fire risk with the wires being exposed and how he's cut into it. And the shelf doesn't even have screws and is mostly in pieces at this point.  
We also ordered him a new bed foundation that he can no longer hide things under it as its covered/soft sided.

The reason I'm wondering if I'm the asshole is while I was talking with my Husband tonight about how I'm very frustrated about the mess and the way his dad has been talking down to both of us this last week especially and that I'm not asking if I can remove literal trash from his the room my husband made a offhand comment about how I've been talking in a mean way this week and that I'm kinda being an asshole.

93,1e6xe04,AITA for telling my brother to relax and enjoy his vacation?,"We are on vacation with our whole family. This is my parents, me, my three siblings, three spouses, and a total of eleven kids ages 5-16. This is a total of twenty people, nine of which being adults and four being teenagers.

Today we all went to the beach. It’s been just small groups of us before this, but today it was everyone. My youngest brother Jim (32M) is the single father of one daughter Amy (5F). I noticed Jim was hanging out by the shore, and Amy kept running up to him, and he was playing with her. It was cute, plus this is family time, so no big deal. 

Then even when Amy was out swimming with her cousins, Jim was standing by the shore watching. It’s hot, so I call him over and ask if he wants to stand under the tent, get a cold drink, etc., and he comes and grabs a soda but goes back out immediately after. 

I finally figure out that he’s watching Amy, and I tell him he needs to relax and enjoy his vacation because she’s going to be fine. He just says he’s worried about her because we forgot her life vest back at the house. I tell him I get it, but I point out how many people are around and that she’s a good swimmer and she’ll be fine. Our whole family is taking turns watching the kids from our canopy. I also point out that my daughter (16F) is out there so she’ll be fine (they’re close, they’re the only girls out of all the kids, and my daughter sees Amy like a little sister). He says he knows, but he’s just worried. We go back and forth for a while until I just give up and walk away. 

A few hours later when the kids decided to come out of the water, Jim is finally back under the tent. Our other brother makes a joke about how Jim is going to have an awful sunglasses tan, and I bring up again that Jim could have just stayed under the tent. Jim goes into his spiel again, and he asks if I would have let my kids alone that little with no life vest, and I said no because they didn’t have older cousins watching them.

We keep going back and forth and I tell him again he needs to just relax and enjoy his vacation. He gets annoyed with me and him and Amy head back to the house early.

My parents were mad at me for cutting their beach day short (Amy ended up falling asleep anyway so not really), my siblings/the spouses are divided, and my daughter’s feelings are hurt that Jim doesn’t trust her with Amy. I wanted an outside perspective.

95,1e6x6nd,AITA for bragging about my first and only hit tweet?,"I at the time was F14 and i was a freshman in highschool with a group of friends i enjoyed spending time with. Towards the end of the school year in January i made a tweet that not a lot if people agreed with my opinion but it was getting a lot of views, almost 150k views. The next day at school i said to my friends “hey look at this my post is getting a lot of views” and because they didnt have twitter i was a little torn when they didnt say anything about it. So then at lunch i said again “my post is getting some more views” thinking they would say something but just said “cool” and i moved on. I knew they didnt really care but i thought because they were my friends they would say something positive or something which now looking back was a bit dumb. I kept seeing how negative the tweet got and deleted but i screenshotted it before deleting it. The smae evening i get a call from one of my friends in the group that i was closest too and she said “we dont want to be friends with you” and ended the call and thats all they said directly. Then texted me long paragraphs about how i was “bragging” and “didnt care for their feelings” which i was completely out of the loop. I only bragged twice about that tweet, and thats the only thing i could brag about comsidering i have a very poor family and we had to downsize when we moved to a new town in 2020, the friends the said i bragged came from families that had more money then mine but they never bragged about it necessarily. Something i was very confused with is why they said i didnt care for their feelings because i did. I know one of my friends had to go see one of their family members that they didnt really like and i asked how it was and hoped it went well. And just in general i asked my group how they all were. They always said “good”, “fine” or something along those lines. 

When i lose a friend i usually try to better myself and hopefully try to gain their trust back and i did for 2 out of the 4. When it came down to 1 of them she would always be so rude and say “f*** you b****” at everything i say but we are all friends again thankfully but i have to know.

102,1e6wqj4,AITA for lashing out at Taco Bell?,"I (18M) decided to buy Taco Bell for my family, which included my parents and little brother, a couple days ago. I put my mobile order in and 5 minutes after my dad drove me to the location. I ordered a good amount of food, totaling $60 for us 4.

I’m standing there waiting for my name to be called before the bag goes on the counter for mobile orders, and 10 minutes later after all the bags have been taken, an employee puts a small ish bag on the cart and doesn’t announce a name. I was pretty sure it wasn’t my food given how much I ordered, but I go up to check anyway and it’s a blank name and it doesn’t weigh what I think the amount of food I ordered would, so I leave it alone. A minute later some Uber Eats guy comes and snatches it without saying anything, and leaves.

Another 10 minutes pass before I become impatient and ask the cashier lady what happened to my food. She clicks stuff on her screen and says to wait a little longer. I do, and nothing comes of it. She disappears into the back.

5 minutes after this I go up to the cook, and ask when my food will be ready. They check their screen and say that my order must’ve disappeared, meaning either someone picked it up or it was never placed. I show them my email receipt to show that it was obviously placed, but they just shrug. I wait 5ish more minutes for anything to happen to no avail.

Me missing $60 worth of food and feeling the vibration of my dads call in my pocket since I’m taking so long pisses me off and so I go to the cashier girl and say “ I need to talk to your manager dude what the fuck.” She looks at me a little weird and says she’ll get him.

He immediately adopts a sort of dismissive tone with me, saying that his employees didn’t do anything out of line and asked if I was sure I checked the mobile orders. I say yes, and he throws up his hands. I ask if they can make my food again, and he says I’d need to pay the $60 again because it’s not clear I ever got my food and something’s wrong with my order, which i guess would be the only reason they’d cook the whole order again and the customer doesn’t pay.

Hearing that I would need to pay $60 again tips me over the edge and I kind of loudly say “I just want my fucking order dude I’ve been waiting forever”. He and all his employees behind him have no look on their face and he says to call corporate and use my order number. I slammed my fists down say “thanks for fucking nothing then” and leave.

My dad is irate when I come back because I ignored his calls after the first one and I took 45 minutes. I explain the situation to him and he says these things happen and that they were probably reluctant to help because I was an asshole customer and yelling.

103,1e6wi54,AITA for giving my family the cold shoulder?,"I (20F) am currently living with my parents, dad's brother, and my younger brother. My parents and I both agreed that if I helped out around the house, pitched in on groceries and bills whenever I could, etc. that living here until I had enough saved up to move out would be no problem. I have never had issues living here until this year.

We have unspoken rules about the groceries. Anyone is welcome to anything (unless somebody states otherwise that it's theirs and theirs only). Things that we don't get often are usually split evenly among the people that want them. Recently, this happened with ice cream sandwiches. A few weeks ago my dad bought a box of 8 and mom didn't want any so everyone else could have 2.

I had one the night he got them and then my second one a few days later. The next morning, I went downstairs and sat next to my mom. Before I could even get a good morning, she says ""You ate FIVE ice cream sandwiches last night."" Not even a question. I told her I had my 2, told her when I had them, and then asked her what made her think that. Apparently, my brother, uncle and dad only had 1 each and the rest of them were all gone meaning that *I* must have eaten the rest of them. (And within one night?) I explained again that I only had my 2 and she just rolled her eyes and said 'sure'.

It really upsets me because it's the third time in the past month alone that my family (not just my mom, but the other 3 as well) has just decided whenever something happens, I *must* have done it no matter how much I say I haven't. I've never lied to my family but because I'm ""fatter"" and ""dumber"" and ""clumsy"" I must have been the one to eat all of the ice cream or leave the dog outside. Ifeel hurt, so I've started ignoring them. I still stick to the agreement my parents and I made, but that's it.

Tonight, my mom started crying outside of my bedroom, talking about what a horrible mother she is, and it honestly makes me feel guilty for ignoring them instead of just talking to them... AITA?

106,1e6w1hb,AITA for listing my partner as an emergency contact?,"I, the bio-mom of two kids, separated from bio-dad two years ago after almost a decade of trying but ultimately giving up on him and his behavior. My current partner came into our lives very quickly after the separation, but didn’t meet the kids for over 6 months. My partner is now a significant part of our lives, though my ex refuses to acknowledge him and insists I never mention him, no matter how relevant and necessary it is. It’s been two years.



My ex has recently taken more interest in parenting duties and demanded to see the (already completed) school paperwork, which he never cared about before. Historically, he’s been unhelpful regarding school and ECs, even causing our older son to have to quit violin at one point by refusing to take him on his days, and blocking our younger son from enrolling in pre-K due to “schedule issues” on his days, despite working from home and being on salary.



Why would I list my partner as an ER contact knowing their dad hates him? Our younger son has a serious medical condition that requires 24/7 care, and anyone caring for him would need to be very comfortable with this and have special training for it. Our son would need to be literally protected from hospital staff until a specialist arrives - most healthcare workers don’t understand this condition and as a result, hospitals can be extremely dangerous for people with his disease if they don’t have an educated and confident advocate. For school emergency contacts, I had already listed my mom and my partner, as both have the necessary medical training and I didn’t think their dad would ever see that paperwork anyway. As far as I know, they’re the only people in town who meet these criteria.



To prevent a meltdown at the school, I informed my ex of this when he demanded the paperwork. He flipped out, but spent all day arguing with me about it rather than coming up with his own suggestions - he has no close friends or family in the area. He was insisting our kids should be alone until one of us can be reached rather than with my partner, who they trust and love. My older son even suggested my partner as an emergency contact. My ex eventually suggested an acquaintance of his who the kids aren’t really familiar with, and when I asked our older son if it was ok with him if I put this person down he said that no, that isn’t ok with him. He didn’t hesitate for a second and insisted that he would want my partner there, or my mom.



I believe my choices are responsible and in the best interest of our children, while my ex prioritizes his feelings over their safety and comfort. He claims I’m being selfish and stirring the pot. I see this as ensuring my children are with someone they trust in an emergency. He has said that in the case of an emergency, he wouldn’t be able to control his emotions if my partner were involved at all and that it would cause drama. I think that’s outrageous, and that he should be able to control himself and prioritize.

They were some expensive earrings too and I didn't feel it was appropriate to spend that much money on it. So instead I offered to put that amount of money towards her debt because I thought that would be a better use of it and help take some stress off of her. She didn't like this and argued why ask her if I wouldn't get her what she wanted.  She also argued that diamond earrings are an investment.  We eventually broke up.

110,1e6vi7j,AITAH for choosing to not be the bigger person?,"Background context as this is important to where I am coming from:

First half of 2021, in a span of 90 days, I experienced some traumatic events: one parent almost died of COVID, one parent was in ICU and also almost died (both have recovered wonderfully), separated from long time partner (incredibly abusive relationship), and the worst one: my first dog died of very aggressive cancer. These events sent me into a massive depressive episode and tbh, lost my will to live.

Fast forward to 2024 and it's been another horrible year: broke my leg at beginning of year and during last week of April: my new dog passed unexpectedly, wrecked car (unintentionally) literally days after my dog died, and through a mutual acquaintance, found out that abusive, cheating ex is not only married now, but also recently became a parent. This last part sounds so trivial but honestly made me internally spiral because this was the life he had always talked about wanting and while he is out in the world living his best life, I get to experience tragedy after tragedy.

So once again, I am back in this massively depressed state and this feels worse than the first time.

The day I broke my leg, I texted everyone I knew and basically broadcast it all over social media.

The day my dog died, I only told those that were closest to me and never publicly acknowledged this event.

The car crash? Told even less people: people that just coincidentally happened to ask how I was. I felt ashamed I had gotten into an accident of that magnitude and that people would think I had done that on purpose. Which, I did not. The other driver was texting and not looking at the road and smashed into me.

The ex partner? Told two people.

However, my best friend Emily, was not someone I told about the accident or the ex part. However, they were out to lunch when I texted a different bestie, Andy, and saw my messages.

Andy later communicated to me that Emily interpreted me not sharing those stories as me being mad at Emily. I explained to Andy that I only told them because they were first name I saw in my texts and had nothing to do with Andy. I literally vented to the first two people I saw when I opened text app.

I also told Andy that I was not mad at Emily by any means.

As an ice breaker, I did text both Emily and their spouse something silly as I normally would do, in hopes that one of them would respond and we could maybe plan to go out and we could address situation in person. Both left me on read and at this point it has been several weeks.

I cannot properly describe how much Im already struggling with my mental health and this is just adding to it.

I really do love my friend but I also don't see how I have done anything to wrong them or to deserve the silent treatment. And I refuse to apologize to anyone about how I am coping with my grief.

112,1e6utz5,AITA for Refusing to Let My 7-Year-Old Cousin Join Our Cousins' Sleepover?,"I (20F) am writing this on behalf of our group of cousins, 22F, 16F, 15M, 13M, and myself. A little background: Starting from a few years back, the five of us would have annual sleepovers together where we would play games, hang out and just have fun together, because we don’t get to see each other often. We usually have it at our grandparents’ house, but we have had them at each other’s houses before as well. Last year, our younger cousin, 6 at the time, let’s call her Sophia (7F), wanted to join us. 

(From this point on, it’s important to note that our family is South Asian-American, so they can hold some traditional cultural views.)

This led to a change in the majority of our plans, including switching out our movies for kid-friendly ones and forgoing our rule/thinking-heavy board games for Connect 4. While this all was annoying, it was doable - the real problem was her attitude. The second we played a song she didn’t know during karaoke or had a couple minutes of chill time where no one talked to each other, she would start whining about being bored, cry, and get our grandparents. As the eldest, this led to my sister (22F) having to spend all her time with Sophia at the urging of our grandparents. My sister later told me how upset she was having to take care of Sophia the whole time instead of hanging out with us, given the very few opportunities we have to see our cousins and each other. 

This year, Sophia wants to attend the sleepover again, with our parents seemingly assuming that her presence is now a given every year after how much she claimed to have enjoyed the last one. We know that little kids idealize sleepovers, so we decided to have a short sleepover at her house and make it as fun as possible for her, then later have our usual one at our grandparents when we would be able to do activities that she wouldn’t like as much. However, now my aunt (ironically not Sophia’s mom) and grandparents are forcing us to include her in both sleepovers. We proposed another solution of having her come to the latter half of our second sleepover, but they stubbornly believe she will entertain herself and we won’t have to put in any extra effort with her around. They are also worried about Sophia’s parents being offended that we are excluding their daughter, to the point that they remind us about it everyday. 

At this point, we are thinking about calling our second sleepover off because none of us have the mental capacity to deal with Sophia’s constant complaining and our grandparents’ lecturing for 4 days; this decision is undoubtedly going to upset Sophia though, so there really is no best option forward.

My mother, who has an Asian immigrant background, often sees me more as an extension of herself for chores rather than as her daughter. We recently had a heated argument about my cooking. I had made some chicken as a meal prep for because I wanted to lose some weight, which she threw away because my brother and father didn’t like it. She knew about me wanting to lose weight and given her tendency to body-shame me, I thought she would at least support me but she didn’t. 

My father is the strict parent in the house. Me and him don’t have the best relationship so as to not go into detail, lets just say me and him only speak to each when necessary. My brother on the other hand, while immature and coddled, is often favored by my mother. He is always the first person she goes to when she needs something. Whenever she calls him, she frequently complains about me being lazy compared to my brother. I don’t think i’m lazy, I work a part time job of at least 20 hours a week while being a full time student that commutes from home that gets good grades (I even made dean’s list and my parents never cared) My brother? unemployed and goes to parties every time and basically lives off the 1k paycheck he gets from our parents. It sounds like I’m degrading my brother and I am…he is 23 and does nothing while I get yelled at. However, maybe i am lazy in my mom’s eyes. 

During our argument, my mother guilt-tripped me, saying no one loves her and no one cares if she dies. I snapped and asked her if she would love me if I died, and questioned why I always have to do chores like laundry while my brother doesn't. I felt years of frustration come out and went to my room after moving the laundry. Hearing her cry made me feel guilty, but I didn't apologize then.

We haven’t discussed the fight since. I feel bad for what I said, but I’m conflicted because I also feel like I deserve an apology. Should I apologize first, or wait for her to apologize? Am I the asshole?

120,1e6trcr,AITA for calling my aunt a selfish c u next Tuesday?,"Okay reddit give it to me straight! I (38f) don't have a large family (mostly due to choice, I'm estranged from 99% of them). Lots of mental illness runs in my family and I don't do drama well so I tend to just keep to myself. That being said, I have 3 family members that I only discovered a few years ago, my step grandmother and 2 half aunts (her daughters). After we met initially, we've built a great bond and I thought they were safe people that I could trust.....

Fast forward to now. I have an almost 1 year old. They've always doted on him since day 1, they babysit for us on weekends, they've been there and have always treated us like family until....his upcoming first birthday. It's just a few days away now and my one aunt out of nowhere decided that she's mad that her birthday seems like an afterthought (her birthday is 1 day after my son's). Her sister/my other half aunt lives on the other side of the country and is flying in for both birthdays. She's never met my son so his party would be the first time she would meet him. Well my aunt thats already mad is also mad at me because she said ""you think my sister is flying in just for your babies birthday and not my birthday"". I have never once made any type of comment/suggestion whatsoever for her to think that I would think that. Not to mention, you're mad at me over something you think that I think? That makes zero sense. All of a sudden now she isn't coming to his party. She's never once acted this way towards us so this all caught me really off guard. We have also always celebrated her birthday with her since we met, and I told her many times recently that I was down to be there for her birthday and excited to celebrate so I have never given her a reason to think her birthday wasn't important, too. She's turning 40 btw. I was obviously very confused and extremely hurt and I tried to reason with her/empathize with her/understand her feelings. But she just kept acting extremely cold, kept yelling at me that ""I just don't get it"" and I eventually snapped and called her a selfish c u next Tuesday and hung up. Her mom is super angry with me now and she is now also refusing to come to her own grandsons party unless I apologize. Her daughter however is not at all required to apologize/take any accountability. 

So reddit, AITA for calling my aunt the c word and would any of you apologize? Or would you write them off and close that door for good?

121,1e6tqhe,AITA for yelling at my mom for the AC unit she sent me?,"The apartment I'm (21NB) subletting has no AC. Even with two fans constantly going, my room is perpetually \~90 degrees. I can't leave the window open, or else the room becomes infested with bugs and mosquitos that come in from the small yard area.

My mom (52F) likes to check in on me, and I've told her about the situation. She offered to buy a screen, and I told her that was fine, but between summer classes and everything, I didn't get to send her the measurements of the window. She sends me a screen anyways. It's too short for the window, and it leaves a gap for bugs to get in. I tell her I appreciate the screen, but to not send anything like that to me without warning. She then sends a fan that her boss swore by that worked. The fan does nothing.

Heat has gotten worse, and it makes it hard to sleep. Mom multiple times offers to send an AC unit. I said no was because I have about a month left before I need to move out. But a week ago, my mom said she found an AC unit on sale, and was having it be sent to me. I told her multiple times that she didn't need to and she insisted that I use it. Today, I spent 3 hours assembling and installing the AC unit, and the unit was too small for the window. I call my mom frustrated, telling her the unit doesn't fit in the window, and she tells me to try and stuff clothes and towels into the sides to keep it steady. I tell her I don't have anything to spare. I try to stuff it with carboard and foam, but the AC can fall out so easily.

She offers to send someone the next day at the crack of dawn to fix the unit, and at this point I'm overheated and frustrated at the unit not working out after 3 hours of trying to make it work on my own. I lash out and I tell her to stop sending me things when she doesn't know if they even fit or will work with where I'm living. I also chastise her for sending me a unit when she knew I wouldn't be able to install it on my own.

I'm being told I'm an asshole because I'm lashing out even when she's offering to fix things. She's saying she didn't have to help. She told me as well that I never told her not to send anything, and that she would have sent help but she knew I was busy so didn't bother. She also tells me that she hates watching her kids suffer, and that I have no clue what it's like being a parent and that one day I'll understand. She's insisting I'm lambasting her and vilifying her for nothing. Maybe she's right, and maybe I don't get it.

She's done this a lot in the past though. I'm just sick of her not listening to me when I insist I'm okay. She's spending money like it grows on trees even though I know my family's not doing too hot financially. As to why I can't buy these myself, I lost my job a couple months back, and most of my money saved up is for food and rent. I've been job hunting for months but I'm not getting anything back.

123,1e6tn96,AITA for being mad my parents got me a car,"I(18 F)have been driving for about a year now. I have been sharing my brother’s (25) car which is a Toyota Prius c AND a hybrid which is much cheaper on gas. At first I wanted my own car but then I became very attached to the Toyota. 

I came back from work today to see my parents sitting outside the driveway with a white convertible buggie, my dream car. They bought it for me as a surprised but I was sad to leave my Prius C. Then my parents told me that I’d have to pay for my own insurance and repairs on the car. As a student in law, I have some arguments against why I should not have to pay repairs on this car! 

1. It’s a Volkswagen, and they break down often
2. They bought it without asking me about my opinion, I was not expecting any financial changes coming up. 
3. It’s a 2008 car, if I were to have bought it I’d spend a little more money on a more recent car so that it would save me money in the long run. 
4. I am a student and don’t have stable income.
5. Now this one is my main argument: Growing up when I wanted something from my dad he would always tell me that I’ll get it when I hit the age my brother got it. For example: my brother got his first phone at 14, I had to wait until I was 14 until I got a phone. We have a 7 year age difference and it felt like a long wait! My brother didn’t have to pay for his own car insurance until he was 25 and he still doesn’t pay repairs, so I should have at least another 7 care free years to not pay for a car. This “fair treatment” excuse was used to help my dad so he didn’t have to pay for extra expenses, but now that that rule has a negative impact on his wallet he’s taking it back and it’s not so fair anymore.

To get an unbiased feedback I’m going to tell you his argument.
When I was 14 I opened up a bank account and my dad started sending me thousands of dollars to save up for a car. In total he sent me about 6k over a span of 9 months. Now 4 years have passed and he’s wondering why I only have 2k left. In those 4 years I’ve bought myself lunch at school and clothes I desperately needed which my dad told me to buy and some stupid knick knacks cause I was a kid and who gives kids thousands of dollars?? 
So he’s saying since I spent that money I should pay for myself. 

Needless to say, I told my parents that if I have to pay, they can take it back and get their 5k back. 

So, am I a petty spoiled brat or do I have good reasoning? 


Update: this morning I reassured my parents that I am very grateful for the car, but was not happy about the payments attached to it. I told them that because it was a gift and they didn’t talk about it with me, I feel as though it’s unfair that now I’m tied down to it.

My dad told me he originally wasn’t planning on making me pay for it, but my mom convinced him to make me pay for insurance and insurance only. When he told me about that he also added that I’d have to pay the repairs as well. (I didn’t mention this but when they got the car there’s already a burnt headlight and a weird sound coming from it that needs fixing). After talking about it calmly, he agreed he’d pay for repairs and insurance, which I’m very grateful for. Now that I’ve gone past that my excitement about the car has started. I feel very bad because my mom originally thought I wasn’t as excited as I should be. I heard from my dad she was all excited about getting this for me. I usually have big emotions when I like a gift (I’ve cried getting 5$ earrings lol) so she had expected me to get really excited and I didn’t show it cause I was worried about my own pocket. Today I’m driving my mom in my new car and we’re gonna run some errands together! 

I’m gonna have fun and decorate my first car make it all cutesy and get a screen on the dash so that I can use Bluetooth, maps and a makeshift rear view camera. Very excited!

124,1e6tljy,AITA for pranking my friend into believing he was getting coached by Zyzz's 'spirit'?,"So, my friend, let's call him ""Jake"" for the purposes of this post, is a huge fan of Zyzz, the Aussie fitness legend and internet sensation who died in 2011. Jake always talks about how Zyzz's videos motivate him and how he wants to achieve that ""aesthetic"" physique. We both work out at the same gym, and recently, Jake's been in a bit of a slump, not making the gains he wants.

A few weeks ago, I had this idea to lift his spirits (pun intended). I set up a fake social media account, pretending to be someone who claimed to be a spiritual medium who could channel fitness legends. I called Jake, telling him that I had heard from Zyzz's spirit specifically for him, offering personalized coaching advice.

Jake was obviously skeptical at first, but after I threw in some Zyzz catchphrases and specific tips tailored to his workout routine, he started to believe it. He got really excited and followed every piece of ""advice"" I sent him. I told him to yell ""U MIRIN' BRAH?"" at his reflection for motivation, which he actually did with real anger, getting lots of weird looks from the other gym-goers.

As the prank continued, I took it up a notch. I convinced one of the gym staff to play along and rearrange the weights on Jake's favorite machine before he arrived, setting them to the exact numbers that I claimed Zyzz's 'spirit' had recommended. When Jake saw the weights set up perfectly for him each time, he thought it was a sign that Zyzz was truly guiding him.

The prank was all in good fun, and Jake actually started pushing himself harder and making great progress. But yesterday, he found out. One of our mutual friends let it slip that I was behind the whole thing. Jake was clearly pissed and confronted me, so I confessed, hoping he'd find it funny.

He didn't take it well. Jake said he felt humiliated and gullible for falling for the prank. He's pretty upset and has been avoiding me since.

AITA?",Asshole,2024-07-19,"AITA for pranking my friend into believing he was getting coached by Zyzz's 'spirit'? So, my friend, let's call him ""Jake"" for the purposes of this post, is a huge fan of Zyzz, the Aussie fitness legend and internet sensation who died in 2011. Jake always talks about how Zyzz's videos motivate him and how he wants to achieve that ""aesthetic"" physique. We both work out at the same gym, and recently, Jake's been in a bit of a slump, not making the gains he wants.

A few weeks ago, I had this idea to lift his spirits (pun intended). I set up a fake social media account, pretending to be someone who claimed to be a spiritual medium who could channel fitness legends. I called Jake, telling him that I had heard from Zyzz's spirit specifically for him, offering personalized coaching advice.

Jake was obviously skeptical at first, but after I threw in some Zyzz catchphrases and specific tips tailored to his workout routine, he started to believe it. He got really excited and followed every piece of ""advice"" I sent him. I told him to yell ""U MIRIN' BRAH?"" at his reflection for motivation, which he actually did with real anger, getting lots of weird looks from the other gym-goers.

125,1e6tek3,AITA for asking my dad why he didnt get me a birthday present and getting upset about his reason,"So, context

My birthday is a day before my mom's 

We usually do small time stuff, like going out to eat with family/friends, mom and dad are divorced 

My grandma and mom own a small cottage in a cottage community, we even have a common assembly house that we all use for common eating together with everyone else in the community.

Now, we were meant to use said common house (newly remodelled) for my mom's 60th birthday party but the contractors had build it wrong and dangerously, so its been closed off for now, I had been planning on using it myself on the my bday for a smaller party for friends and colleagues, that way there would still be the essentials the next day for my mom's birthday without us having to do double work.

As i couldn't use it, I opted to instead invite my closest friends to a small get-together at our cottage (had a blast)

Now, the next day we held my mom's very smaller 60th birthday party in our cottage with a bunch of her friends (both private and friends from the community, originally she had invited close to 50 people) and colleagues and family (her best friends family is basically family to me and my sis) and my dad came too, as my mom and dad are on good terms.

My mom gets presents and some of the people gave me presents too as it *was* my birthday just the day before after all 

But not my dad, he has been busy with traveling and a possible new job opportunity and I felt this was better asked in person so I didn't really get a chance until today where we were gonna discuss a trip to germany he had asked if i wanted to take with him, to spend some quality time, now, the way he asked me this back then really indicated that he wanted to TAKE me on a trip, and giving that he didnt get me a present i figured that the trip might be the present, however it was really a 50/50 paid trip so...

i popped the question and I'm still absolutely gobsmacked about his response

""You didn't invite me to your birthday, I dont usually give people presents unless I'm invited""

But that's such stupid logic, he KNEW that he was Invited to the SAME place as I would hold my smaller birthday party as my mom was going to use, and we didn't see a point in inviting him on a Friday where he would probably work only for him to come again the day after.

I then pointed out that the people that gave me presents also hadn't been invited to *my* birthday party but still gave me presents, and that apparently didn't make him see my point at all lol, started changing subject and after a bit we said our farewells and I left, still absolutely flabbergasted that he didn't even bother with wiring me money (like he usually does on my birthday) and that he didnt even consider that I wouldnt hold anything because it was my mom's big year.

128,1e6sele,AITA for not putting up with my boyfriend’s mom’s behaviour,"|(26F) and my partner(26M) have been together for about a year and a half now. His mom has said some passive aggressive comments about me before. Never invited me out with them. (have only seen her three times) It’s offensive but I have never made a fuss about it till now.

About a month ago, she told my boyfriend that it he was serious about me and wanted me around that I need to come see his family more. We had a nice dinner following this.
Then last night, she asks his schedule because she wants to do dinner with her mom. He said that he was off Saturday but him and I were gunna go to the market so just plan around that.
She went off about how he needs a life outside of me and she never once cared nor asked about what I was doing. and that I'm not invited (along with the word shocker). She told him that he only does whatever I want and that she only ever sees him if I am there (again I have met her 3 times). And that I am controlling of him and he needs to be himself. (I have never told him he can't do or go anywhere). Among other things like making negative comments about the time I spend with my baby nephew? 

My boyfriend was upset and I comforted him but also said I would like to remove her from my instagram and not try to form a relationship with her anymore. This made him annoyed because it's his mom and she always says stuff she doesn't mean when she’s mad. I just explained that I don't tolerate toxic adult behaviour, no matter who it is. I assured him he is still free to see and talk to her but I just don't want to be involved. He isn't on the same page and thinks I am not being understanding of her.

129,1e6s2ta,AITA? Roommate wants to pay half month rent for August,"So my roommate, 28f wants to pay half month rent for August. She’s leaving September. So I, 25f own my house and my bf lives with me (he pays his portion) and we rent a room to a friend from college. She is notoriously bad with money. She has told us she will move out by September 1st. I have already found a new roommate to move in then, already signed the lease and taken the deposit. 
Our current roommate, let’s call her Amy, is bad with money. She makes the same as me, but goes on trips she can’t afford and has debt. She also has asked me for money in the past, telling me how she was having trouble with bills and how she wanted her hair and nails done before she went on her trip. 
She always pays on time and is respectful of the fact I own the house. She’s just not good with money. She has three trips planned before she moves out, and she plans to buy all new furniture before moving and put it on a credit card. 
She asked me if she can pay Half month rent in August (normal rent is $725 including utilities) since she is going on two vacations and then plans to move out the weekend of the 26th. She says August is hectic. 
Now in my opinion that’s not how it works. She wants to pay half rent because she won’t be there, but her stuff will. She wants to leave her stuff and not move out until the week of the 26th. In a normal apt you pay rent even if ur shit is there. I still pay my mortgage even if I take a vacation for a month. Would I be the asshole to charge her until she gives up possession of the property? 
She did sign a lease and I did tell her that I would prorate any rent from when she moved out. (Refund her for the days she isn’t there). She acts like we’re close friends, by asking me to do her favors, etc. but everytime we’ve gone to hangout she cancels because some other friend or family mentees is available. She’s not home much because she’s very active in her church, like every day she’s doing something with her church or church friends.

130,1e6s2ai,AITA for asking my boyfriend's mom my money back?,"My \[30M\] bf's \[24M\] mom \[44F\] is a nice woman who supported him even before he came out. She cares for me a lot and confides in me more than my BF. She disliked my BF's first boyfriend because he always made disrespectful comments about the lack of money of them.

Since her husband left 20 years ago, she has struggled financially and lives in a poor area. My BF has been helping her, giving her almost 30% of his earnings. When I met my BF two years ago, I made six times his income, but he never asked me for money. Now he earns half my income and has no debts, but still helps his mom. We live together and we both pay our share for the house’s expenses (I pay the mortgage since the house is mine).

A year ago, her mother asked me to lend her some money but asked me not to tell my bf; I lent her the money and she didn't pay me back. I waited two months until I told my bf what happened; he got embarrassed and paid me. Time passed and she again asked me for some money, I told my bf about it. He asked her subtly if she needed some extra money, and she said no... A few weeks later, she asked me again and told me please not to tell him because it embarrassed her.

My boyfriend realizes she was embarrassed to asking him for it, so he told me that if she asked me again, he is going to paid me back every single time. So, we agreed on it. She asked me 3 times again for money > she ""forgets"" to pay > my bf paid me back. I ended up telling my BF that I wasn't feeling ok with it, so I will not be lending her more money, but I told her that politely.

Fast forward to yesterday, the three of us were eating at a restaurant and it started to rain. We were far away from his mother's place, so I told them it would be better to book an Uber for her. My boyfriend booked it, but 30 minutes later, Uber wasn't coming. She then called a friend of hers that also do Uber rides, and she said that she would be charging her $50 in cash for the ride. Neither my bf nor her had cash, so I gave her the money.

Minutes later, her friend called to say that she couldn't make it, so my bf booked again via Uber, this time an Uber confirmed. Without even thinking on it, I just said, ""Oh! well, then you can give my cash back"", with a simple smile and stretched out my hand, they both were astonished, and she gave my money back.

Later that night, his mother texted him saying that she felt it was rude of me to ask her for the money back. Then my BF told me that he was also upset since we agreed that anytime she asked me for money, he was going to pay me back.

My husband immediately got upset at my suggestion, despite my reasoning that I needed to go check the mail and was just suggesting we make a camping trip out of it. (Considering our camper is out on this property it isn’t unreasonable or costly to camp there). 

Our Facebook messenger conversation was getting heated so I put my phone down and ate my dinner. (I’m autistic and don’t realize I am hungry ever, so I need to force myself to eat at certain times of the day, or else I get more sensitive to my trigger stimuli). 

My husband showed up at my house. When I saw his truck I felt my heart race. I checked my phone and he never messaged or mentioned coming over. In the moment I felt threatened and scared. I did however open the door and calmly say hello. He started in at me “you’re so fucking out of touch”, and wouldn’t lower his voice. We yelled in front of our two year old as she was sitting in the same room. He then went to take her and we fought because I felt he was in the wrong for showing up at my house and yelling at me unwarranted. I had to threaten to call the cops to get him to leave. 

Now I’m not so sure we should keep trying couples counseling or plan to live together starting September. I can’t believe his reaction to a simple suggestion to go camping as a family at the property we own three hours out of the city. 

Am I missing something? 

Is he keeping me from the property for some reason? I told him I’d go regardless of him joining me to collect the mail and he was still very angry. 

If this was just about money, or gas, I don’t think he’d be so angry.

133,1e6rt1f,AITA for wanting the patio door closed? ,"My partner (22m) and I (24f) currently live with my parents. My siblings, who are in their twenties as well, live here, too. However, when we moved back in, there wasn’t enough bedrooms, so my parents converted the second living room into a bedroom. Incredibly grateful for this. 

To note: this room has no windows. Just a patio door. 

The trouble started with the heat. Despite having two fans running 24/7, it’s incredibly muggy. During the day, we leave the patio door open. Recently my partner has insisted on keeping it open throughout the night. 

A couple weeks ago our neighbors house had a home invasion, and crime has spiked in our area. For this reason, I think it’s a bad idea to keep the patio door open when we sleep. Even though it’s unbearably hot. 

He says I have nothing to be scared of, and that what happened to the neighbors, is unlikely to happen to us. It’s been a point of tension. The nights where he keeps it open, I struggle to sleep. I recognize this might be paranoia, but I really, really don’t feel safe—especially because we’re both heavy sleepers. 

The last few nights, admittedly, I’ve closed the patio door. This has made him upset and we’ve gotten into an argument about it.

137,1e6r9xi,AITA for trying to help with my boyfriend’s car..,"I’m a 30f & my partner is 36M. We don’t have children nor live together, but I have a 6 year old son. We have been together for 4 years on & off. Most recently, 1 yr. I am a full time phlebotomist & he works for a company fixing office machines. 
Past two days, I’ve been staying at his house to spend some time together & because he’s been having a hard time coping with his FT job. The motivation is lost & he’s been drowning in household chores, bills, ect*. So, I thought why not ease some of the stress by bringing my company for more than just two days (weekends).
He has to drive a lot for his job so that racks up mileage in his vehicle & takes a lot of time away from things he could be doing instead of driving hours a day.(He owns another car, but that one blew up & sits in his driveway. He had to purchase this one hastily & hates it. It’s a ‘15 Elantra). 
He finds there’s a massive clunking sound when he runs it, & it didn’t happen until he got home. He checks & finds there’s no oil in the vehicle. He’s only had the car for four months. 
He phones me while I’m driving from work & we discuss his solutions. Once we’re done, I tell him to let me know if he figures anything new out. He asks me to pick up some oil for him.
I suggest the correct oil after searching Google (5w20) but he told me to buy 10w20 thinking “5w20 is too thin” (???) after purchasing the oil, beginning my drive to him, he then texts me asking to get the other instead— one I was going to buy to begin with. 
Once I got to his place, the hood of his vehicle was open, & he was inside. 
Thinking I’m helping, I got my funnel, poured the oil in, & shortly after started the vehicle. 
Now, mind you, I worked at a car dealership for 4 years but he was a mechanic in the Air Force for about four or five years himself. 
After he realizes what I’ve been doing, he comes down frustratingly talking to me like I don’t know what I’m doing & that I should have asked to touch his vehicle. 
I express that a little thanks would have been appreciated & head up stairs to unwind after work. After a while, I see him lingering the hallway. He then asks if I’m upset with him & I explain that I feel like he undermines me for my lack of knowledge in some areas… it’s always about how much he knows & why I shouldn’t do something without him or at all. 
We get into a heated debate after I expressed how it made me feel & he began doing the exact thing I said he did: belittle my vehicle knowledge.
He THEN goes on to explain that the engine has a recall & that now he can’t take it there cause I “dumped” oil into the tank. I asked why he didn’t tell me this in text like I asked him to & he says it doesn’t matter because he didn’t think I’d take it upon myself to do what I did.

I always offer up rides if I am hanging out with my friends if it’s convenient or on the way as I really don’t mind. I never expect nor ask for any gas payments as I’m usually the one to suggest the ride - plus my friends typically pay for parking or a coffee or my meal in return. 

I have one friend (M22) who I’ve known since we were both 15. He lives like a 10 minute drive from me and is my only friend who ever asks for a ride. I’ve been driving him to where ever we are going since we were 17. The problem is that whenever I go to pick him up, I wait outside his house up to 10-20 minutes. I always make sure to call him once I am getting ready (so he can get ready too), call before I leave so he knows he has 10 more minutes before I arrive, call him when I’m 3 minutes away so he knows I’m pulling up, and have shared my location with him so he can see how close I am. Yet, I still wait more than 10 minutes outside his house. I typically give a 5-8 minute grace period for my friends because there may be a last minute bathroom trip or they might need to talk to family before leaving. But with this friend specifically, it’s been every single time for 4 years. I’ve been becoming more and more irritated each time. He always apologizes for the delay but offers no viable excuse (ex: he was brushing his teeth, packing his bag). He has only paid me for gas once and has bought me a single coffee as compensation for all the drives in 4 years. On top of that, he expects me to drive him home after we all hang out. 

Every time he has apologized, I typically respond with “Yeah well please try to be outside next time.” Yet, it hasn’t happened. 

I am now fed up and have stopped offering him rides. I make up excuses as to why I cannot drive him to our big group hangouts and haven’t hung out with him in months because I know he would ask for/expect a ride.
