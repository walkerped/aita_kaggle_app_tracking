0,1e7z55t,AITA For refusing to let my girlfriend post pictures of me online?,"I’m a 20 yrs old Transgender man and my gf 22 has been with me for just about a year and there’s always been this issue in our relationship where I won’t let her posts pictures of me online on her story (mostly Instagram).

As I explained , i am transgender and nowhere near having a good cis-passing (aka passing as male) and seeing myself makes me extremely insecure. I tried explaining the issue to her and all she could reply was how she, and I quote « wasn’t dating an emoji » and how frustrated she felt to have to retake pictures until I felt comfortable with my appearance so she could post it.

I got some fake snake bite loops and have been wearing them, as I really like the look.  I have been thinking and wanting a lip piercing for years now but never voiced it to my family.  I was able to find some fake ones on Amazon and ordered them.  I love how they look and they make me feel very good and cool.

She recently got a new job and now only works 8 hour day, so today was the first time she saw them.  She immediately asked what I had on my face and called them hideous and ugly, insisting that I looked like I had smeared chocolate all over my face and then proceeded to make fun of my weight.

I really like them and when I told her that she said it’s my body but then continued to make snide remarks.  I am leaving in a few weeks for university and don’t need her permission to do these types of things as I am a legal adult and leaving home.  I am also currently trying to get my 2nd piercings done on my ears but she keeps saying that we have things planned for the day I want to get them done so I can’t book an appointment, then the day comes and we don’t do anything.  I am going to keep wearing the fake piercings for a few weeks and if I like them then I plan to get them done, but I feel she will get mad and insult me when I do.

2,1e7j55p,AITA for intervening with my husbands parenting?,"My husband was in bed this morning until 10 watching a movie when our children boys (8 & 9) were downstairs with me, they were playing when the playing ended in my oldest hitting the younger one. I immediately took the game off him and sent him to his room where he cried and kept calling for me.
My husband came down and I explained what happened and he yelled at our oldest how bad he is and our oldest talked back and said he doesn’t want to listen to him he just wants me so my husband picked him up and put him outside the house in his pyjamas. I was not okay with this as our son was staying in his room and was not coming out just crying and I don’t think he really had to argue with a child when our son was already crying.
When he put him outside I said that’s a bit too far… he’s in his pyjamas and there’s still ice on the ground and it’s raining.
My husband yelled at me that there’s no more tv, no games, no snacks and if I don’t listen to him then he’s leaving… I said I’m not okay with you telling me how to parent when you don’t parent yourself so he grabbed a bag and left and texted me ‘I hate you’ I haven’t replied so he keeps telling me how bad of a mother and person I am. 
I didn’t mean to undermine his parenting but I really disagree with how far he goes and that he hardly ever parents, he just always tells me I’m doing it wrong.
I’m feeling very unsure of my parenting now, should I have stepped back and let him try it his way? 
Thank you for reading this far! Appreciate all answers 


Edit-
This has happened before however it was him putting our youngest in a cold shower with his clothes on because he was being disrespectful to dad too. I disagreed with that
I do agree you need to be a united front but these punishments just feel excessive to me…. I am very soft so it could just be me but they’re not bad kids, they get fantastic grades at school and everyone says they’re delights to be around.
They just really don’t like their dad and I think they argue with each other a lot because they’re so close in age

Edit 2

Thank you everyone for taking the time to answer.
I feel incredibly upset and also slightly relieved to have my feelings validated as when he had mentioned the shower punishment to friends and family everyone had brushed it off and didn’t act like it was abusive and more horrified that my youngest has sworn at him which had me questioning myself.

I should pre-face this with the fact that I'm a workaholic and enabler. This has contributed very poorly to my health to the point that I am forced to make radical life style changes. I wasn't taking care of myself, and always put myself last. I can see how damaging that is now. Last week I was diagnosed with a serious heart issue that is further complicated by the pneumonia I got two weeks ago that I and am recovering from. I'm still constantly coughing up phlegm, getting dizzy, out of breath, having chest pain, high blood pressure around 170/120 and the cherry on top is I pulled my back from all the coughing.

Thursday night my wife came home from work to ask me in front of our young children if we could go to a local food fair with her cousins who are in town. Our kids immediately went ballistic over the prospect, so in front of them I reluctantly agreed. The thing is her cousins were extremely rude to us in the past, and I wanted to be present if our kids were going to meet them again. I felt ambushed and roped in to it when normally just going to the park we would ask the other in private if were up for it.

When the kids were put to bed I asked my wife if she truly wanted to go to the food fair, or if she just wants to please her cousin and she said she did. I told her that our daughter has severe allergies and she can't even eat anything there, and my wife shrugged it off.

The following lunch, I talked to my wife again and explained to her that I can barely walk, our daughter can't even eat anything there, and I have standing plans with my friends every Friday night, so can we reschedule something else, and she's very upset that she has to cancel the plans now after she ok'd it with her cousin last night.

I've been friends with Maddie since I was a few months old (Our parents have a mutual friend), and I've been friends with Jenny since I was around 6-8 years old. We've all been best friends for a while now, but I still feel really bad talking about how I feel about this, mainly because I get really nervous whenever I want to confront someone who I happen to be friends with.

Anyway, we're all in a groupchat together, and something I've noticed recently is that they only really respond to each other's messages, and they kinda just ignore mine. For example, I posted a picture of a fanfic that someone gifted to me on Ao3 because it was genuinely really sweet of that person, and it meant a lot to me.

Jenny responded by sending a picture of something that a girl we know reposted on TikTok and then her and Maddie started having a conversation about school and how freezing it is outside.

This isn't the first time they've done this either. I posted a picture of an article about 'How to talk to a woman wearing headphones' and I said 'How to talk to a woman wearing headphones: Don't' and nobody responded. Jenny and Maddie started having another unrelated conversation and nobody ever responded to that picture.

Idk, maybe I'm being dramatic, but I just want to know if I should be worried about it or not. Again, I might just be acting dramatic and making a mountain out of a molehill, but I genuinely don't know what to do. The only message they've actually responded to recently was about how I can't hang out because I'm going to a different county for a funeral.

8,1e7il2k,AITA for reporting a maintenance issue to property management?,"I live in an apartment complex that is about 40 years old. So things break and need fixed as any property would. The management is picky about having things in shared spaces and has done a whole initiative to make the outside of the buildings and the hallways look more modern and consistent. They send emails about the smallest little “infractions” to include bird feeding and outdoor chairs.

My neighbors and I have a group text where we share if there are any issues we are experiencing such as electrify or hot water issues and often one will create the report when a building problem.

One time my neighbors had a plumbing issues and it flooded my unit. It took days to clean up but I chalked it up to apartment living. They apologized profusely and I really did not even think it was their fault. I later learned that they’d installed a bidet that the complex did not authorize and they were chastized by maintenance about it, I don’t know if that contributed to the plumbing issue.

We have all been friendly and exchange niceties whenever we cross paths. We have shared meals. Generally nice neighbors things. I’ve shared various herb cuttings from my kitchen garden that I thought they might enjoy cooking with and they decided to propagate and start growing them.

This year they got more interested in growing vegetables in containers and put them outside. I contributed to their new interest with some growing vegetables that I came across while at a farm store and they were thrilled.

The property management saw the early growth and asked them to stop. They found some line in the lease that allowed for a small amount of blooming plants so the management left them alone. Since then they have expanded their garden and asked to place things close to my windows. I don’t own the outdoors or use those areas so did not mind.

Recently we had rainstorms and while walking in the building I noticed a large hole where the ground had eroded under the concreter patio slab and the corner of the brick building. It was about 8 inches deep and 6 inches wide. I was alarmed and sent a message to the group chat since I didn’t want anyone to step in it or have their pet in the area where a foot or leg might get hurt, but the main concern was a potential structural impact on the shared building.

I sent a request and the management fixed the issue. Once it was completed they sent an email asking that whoever had plants move them in 4 days or they would toss them.

My neighbor was furious and said the hole was not my problem and that had something happened the property management would have to fix the building and compensate us for any inconvenience. I had no idea that the plants were in danger if maintenance were called to inspect the area but really did not think of that because there was a huge hole that I felt was a risk to the entire building.

I later learned that they’d installed a bidet that the complex did not authorize and they were chastized by maintenance about it, I don’t know if that contributed to the plumbing issue.

We have all been friendly and exchange niceties whenever we cross paths. We have shared meals. Generally nice neighbors things. I’ve shared various herb cuttings from my kitchen garden that I thought they might enjoy cooking with and they decided to propagate and start growing them.

This year they got more interested in growing vegetables in containers and put them outside. I contributed to their new interest with some growing vegetables that I came across while at a farm store and they were thrilled.

The property management saw the early growth and asked them to stop. They found some line in the lease that allowed for a small amount of blooming plants so the management left them alone. Since then they have expanded their garden and asked to place things close to my windows. I don’t own the outdoors or use those areas so did not mind.

Recently we had rainstorms and while walking in the building I noticed a large hole where the ground had eroded under the concreter patio slab and the corner of the brick building. It was about 8 inches deep and 6 inches wide. I was alarmed and sent a message to the group chat since I didn’t want anyone to step in it or have their pet in the area where a foot or leg might get hurt, but the main concern was a potential structural impact on the shared building.

I sent a request and the management fixed the issue. Once it was completed they sent an email asking that whoever had plants move them in 4 days or they would toss them.

My neighbor was furious and said the hole was not my problem and that had something happened the property management would have to fix the building and compensate us for any inconvenience. I had no idea that the plants were in danger if maintenance were called to inspect the area but really did not think of that because there was a huge hole that I felt was a risk to the entire building.

9,1e7iin7,AITA for making my husband reschedule our anniversary dinner?,"AITA? My husband and I have an anniversary this weekend. Today he called at 5:30pm on his way home from work and told me to have the kids ready to go that we had dinner reservations at 7pm. The kids had been at camp all week and I had just started folding and putting away a load of laundry. I was a little frustrated because there wasn't really a heads up and getting the kids ready, myself showered and ready, in addition to dropping the kids off at drop-in daycare (because who is going to be available to babysit with an hours notice?!), and traveling to the restaurant all within an hour and a half was not feasible. So, instead of asking me he moved our reservation back to 8:15pm. Our kids are young, and usually go to bed by 7:30pm. I also have to work tomorrow morning (I get up at 5am) so honestly 8:15 was not an ideal time and would put everyone in bed late. He's upset that he made plans they are not working out.

10,1e7ii5r,AITA for yelling at my brother for eating my noodles,"To give some context my brother (20) has always been an asshole to me (freshly 18). I don’t believe he has ever apologized to anyone. He calls me a fat pig, tells me that Im ugly and says I shouldn’t eat so much, he has never apologized for it. He once broke my arm (I don’t blame him it was an accident) but instead of apologizing or helping me, he fucking laughed at me for crying. He is also racist, homophobic and transphobic. So today I woke up at 3 pm. Usually when I wake up this late I don’t eat a big lunch so I’ll still be hungry for dinner. So I only ate a cinnamon roll and went back to my room. Me and my brother eat different things at lunch since he is a picky eater. He only wants my dad to buy this specific Danish dessert/ breakfast for him that he eats for lunch. He is very happy with this and doesn’t want anything else. I really like those Korean Buldak noodles but they recently got banned in Denmark so i stocked up on them before the ban to eat for lunch. A little more context is that a while ago before the ban my brother also took my buldak noodles, that time I caught him and I didn’t get mad so I just showed him how to make them properly. later I came to see if he liked them only for him to think they were too spicy (which I had warned him about) and that he just didn’t like the flavor. So today he comes into my room at 5pm, while my dad was already in here, he is completely orange around his mouth. My dad asks if he ate the noodles and he says yes. So I tell him that he’s a bitch for doing that since they no longer sell them. And he just says “ok?”. 2 hours later at dinner I make a joke that he can’t possibly be hungry already. He doesn’t find this very funny and starts grumbling. I ask if he ate it as a soup because that’s what it looked like in the kitchen, and he says that he did. So now I’m also kinda angry that he took my food and didn’t even eat it properly. I tell him that I think he’s an asshole for eating my discontinued lunch, and that I never ever eat his food since I know that’s all he eats and it would be disrespectful. I say “he’s an asshole and if he can’t see it himself then he’s an idiot”. My father says that my brother understands, so I ask my brother if he understands and he just grumbles while looking at his plate in an annoyed voice that he understands. 5 mins later my dad asks my brother if he wants any cucumber. I say “I don’t think he’s ‘that’ hungry”. My brother takes the cucumber in his hand and says “I’ll stick this in your face if you don’t shut up”. I ask “stick this in my face?” Since it didn’t make sense. And before I finish my sentence he flings the cucumber at my face but I moved my head so It hits the wall and bounces across the room. He angrily takes another portion of food and goes to his room. I start crying because yk. I tell my dad that I Would’ve forgiven him if he had just apologized without getting aggressive.

11,1e7ifzg,AITA for banning my friend from my DND campaign?,"Hello!
Already sorry for the mistakes and all English is not my first language.

This story starts 5months ago when I(20NB) want to create a DND campaign. My best friend (21F) is really interested in it (even tho she found the book I wrote ""boring af"") .I propose the campaign to her and her friends. We talked a few times before cause they also do DND .
So I propose it to them,create the server with the help of one of them and start creating a tutorial for how to create a character sheet,cause I knew with the different timezones (I'm in Europe ,they're American) we couldn't really vc to create it .But I told them ""if you have ANYTHING to ask/ say to me or if you need help DM me and I'll help you or ask for a vc and we'll see that together"" .

A few months pass and I pinged them multiple times to see if they progressed ,no one answered. One night ,I had a shitty day and my best friend ask me if the campaign is still on, I told her ""welp ,we'll see"" I pinged an everyone to see if anyone was still interested (at this point only my best friend created their sheet and no one had sent me a dm or asked a vc so I thought everything was good cause no answer to my pings). And one of the players sent me a dm telling me they're not interested anymore cause they thought the campaign was abandoned and that I wasn't involved in it. Explained to her that I pinged them multiple times asking if they needed help. Her excuse was that I didn't Dmed them properly,saying that I should have dm-ed them personally to do their sheet together.And she starts ranting about how in her 15years of experience they always did like this and bla bla blah .
Honestly,didn't read it fully ,left her on read,banned them from the server and sent a screenshot of the DL in the server saying that the campaign was over cause I didn't want bored players ,calling them ""dead weights""
My best friend said that it was a two part problem,how I miscommunicated with them and that the campaign should still be played ,told her no ,I couldn't play with people that are not passionate about the universe I created from endless nights on caffeine ,which I put blood sweat and tears to create a DND campaign,and banned her as well as the rest of her friends.

She texted me saying that I was overreacting and the campaign could still be played if everyone made peace and forgot the past.

Honestly I don't see myself doing it with people not answering my messages and not telling me upfront when they need help and are just waiting for me to come take their hands like little kids.

13,1e7iccj,AITA for having different beliefs than my friend?,"So I (15f)  go to a very religious school. Most people in my class are very religious, for example they'll post edits of gods on their social media, draw them all the time, etc. One day I was talking to my friend that we'll call ""red"" and her friend group. From that conversation they got to know that I was agnostic (they didn't understand what agnostic meant so I just told them I'm an atheist). After that red has been somewhat passive aggressive with me but I shrugged it off. For example once this bossy classmate raised her voice at me for no reason and I started to tear up (it was completely unintentional, it's a reaction I cannot control that happens because of previous bad experiences). I tried to hide it and red said ""cry more"" in a passive aggressive tone. There have been more instances like this. She has been so rude after I told her that I'm agnostic and I didn't realise it was because of that until the following conversation.

So our school decided to take us to watch a movie. It was an illogical cash grab. It was very fast paced with so many colourful bright colours and loud music it was like live-action cocomelon. In one scene it was clearly shown that a character had died, there's no way that character could have made it out alive a fucking helicopter fell on that mf and we were shown him dying on camera. 
Then after a bit that character randomly appears out of nowhere and it was so illogical.

I told red ""how tf did that character come out of nowhere it was made so clear that he died, a motherfucking plane fell on top of him??""
I thought she would just laugh and agree with me but she got aggressive and started saying ""it's because of God! Anything can happen with their power, you won't understand because you're an atheist""
This was out of nowhere considering this movie had nothing to do with God? I literally said nothing about God? If it was a religious film and it was clearly implied the character was revived by a god then her reaction would be understandable, but it's just poor writing. You cannot just blame completely illogical writing with ""it happened because of God!"".

This made me realise that the reason she had been so passive aggressive with me this whole time was because I was agnostic 

What makes this even more funny is that  I literally follow her religion better than her even though I don't believe in it, like taking any life/consciousness away is always going to be a sin in her religion yet she still eats meat but I'm vegetarian because of health religion so I find this ironic as fuck. Being mean to others in any circumstance is also forbidden in her religion yet she here she is.

Is what I said truly that bad or is she over-reacting?
