0,1e7z55t,AITA For refusing to let my girlfriend post pictures of me online?,"I’m a 20 yrs old Transgender man and my gf 22 has been with me for just about a year and there’s always been this issue in our relationship where I won’t let her posts pictures of me online on her story (mostly Instagram).

As I explained , i am transgender and nowhere near having a good cis-passing (aka passing as male) and seeing myself makes me extremely insecure. I tried explaining the issue to her and all she could reply was how she, and I quote « wasn’t dating an emoji » and how frustrated she felt to have to retake pictures until I felt comfortable with my appearance so she could post it.

I got some fake snake bite loops and have been wearing them, as I really like the look.  I have been thinking and wanting a lip piercing for years now but never voiced it to my family.  I was able to find some fake ones on Amazon and ordered them.  I love how they look and they make me feel very good and cool.

She recently got a new job and now only works 8 hour day, so today was the first time she saw them.  She immediately asked what I had on my face and called them hideous and ugly, insisting that I looked like I had smeared chocolate all over my face and then proceeded to make fun of my weight.

I really like them and when I told her that she said it’s my body but then continued to make snide remarks.  I am leaving in a few weeks for university and don’t need her permission to do these types of things as I am a legal adult and leaving home.  I am also currently trying to get my 2nd piercings done on my ears but she keeps saying that we have things planned for the day I want to get them done so I can’t book an appointment, then the day comes and we don’t do anything.  I am going to keep wearing the fake piercings for a few weeks and if I like them then I plan to get them done, but I feel she will get mad and insult me when I do.

2,1e7j55p,AITA for intervening with my husbands parenting?,"My husband was in bed this morning until 10 watching a movie when our children boys (8 & 9) were downstairs with me, they were playing when the playing ended in my oldest hitting the younger one. I immediately took the game off him and sent him to his room where he cried and kept calling for me.
My husband came down and I explained what happened and he yelled at our oldest how bad he is and our oldest talked back and said he doesn’t want to listen to him he just wants me so my husband picked him up and put him outside the house in his pyjamas. I was not okay with this as our son was staying in his room and was not coming out just crying and I don’t think he really had to argue with a child when our son was already crying.
When he put him outside I said that’s a bit too far… he’s in his pyjamas and there’s still ice on the ground and it’s raining.
My husband yelled at me that there’s no more tv, no games, no snacks and if I don’t listen to him then he’s leaving… I said I’m not okay with you telling me how to parent when you don’t parent yourself so he grabbed a bag and left and texted me ‘I hate you’ I haven’t replied so he keeps telling me how bad of a mother and person I am. 
I didn’t mean to undermine his parenting but I really disagree with how far he goes and that he hardly ever parents, he just always tells me I’m doing it wrong.
I’m feeling very unsure of my parenting now, should I have stepped back and let him try it his way? 
Thank you for reading this far! Appreciate all answers 


Edit-
This has happened before however it was him putting our youngest in a cold shower with his clothes on because he was being disrespectful to dad too. I disagreed with that
I do agree you need to be a united front but these punishments just feel excessive to me…. I am very soft so it could just be me but they’re not bad kids, they get fantastic grades at school and everyone says they’re delights to be around.
They just really don’t like their dad and I think they argue with each other a lot because they’re so close in age

Edit 2

Thank you everyone for taking the time to answer.
I feel incredibly upset and also slightly relieved to have my feelings validated as when he had mentioned the shower punishment to friends and family everyone had brushed it off and didn’t act like it was abusive and more horrified that my youngest has sworn at him which had me questioning myself.

I should pre-face this with the fact that I'm a workaholic and enabler. This has contributed very poorly to my health to the point that I am forced to make radical life style changes. I wasn't taking care of myself, and always put myself last. I can see how damaging that is now. Last week I was diagnosed with a serious heart issue that is further complicated by the pneumonia I got two weeks ago that I and am recovering from. I'm still constantly coughing up phlegm, getting dizzy, out of breath, having chest pain, high blood pressure around 170/120 and the cherry on top is I pulled my back from all the coughing.

Thursday night my wife came home from work to ask me in front of our young children if we could go to a local food fair with her cousins who are in town. Our kids immediately went ballistic over the prospect, so in front of them I reluctantly agreed. The thing is her cousins were extremely rude to us in the past, and I wanted to be present if our kids were going to meet them again. I felt ambushed and roped in to it when normally just going to the park we would ask the other in private if were up for it.

When the kids were put to bed I asked my wife if she truly wanted to go to the food fair, or if she just wants to please her cousin and she said she did. I told her that our daughter has severe allergies and she can't even eat anything there, and my wife shrugged it off.

The following lunch, I talked to my wife again and explained to her that I can barely walk, our daughter can't even eat anything there, and I have standing plans with my friends every Friday night, so can we reschedule something else, and she's very upset that she has to cancel the plans now after she ok'd it with her cousin last night.

I've been friends with Maddie since I was a few months old (Our parents have a mutual friend), and I've been friends with Jenny since I was around 6-8 years old. We've all been best friends for a while now, but I still feel really bad talking about how I feel about this, mainly because I get really nervous whenever I want to confront someone who I happen to be friends with.

Anyway, we're all in a groupchat together, and something I've noticed recently is that they only really respond to each other's messages, and they kinda just ignore mine. For example, I posted a picture of a fanfic that someone gifted to me on Ao3 because it was genuinely really sweet of that person, and it meant a lot to me.

Jenny responded by sending a picture of something that a girl we know reposted on TikTok and then her and Maddie started having a conversation about school and how freezing it is outside.

This isn't the first time they've done this either. I posted a picture of an article about 'How to talk to a woman wearing headphones' and I said 'How to talk to a woman wearing headphones: Don't' and nobody responded. Jenny and Maddie started having another unrelated conversation and nobody ever responded to that picture.

Idk, maybe I'm being dramatic, but I just want to know if I should be worried about it or not. Again, I might just be acting dramatic and making a mountain out of a molehill, but I genuinely don't know what to do. The only message they've actually responded to recently was about how I can't hang out because I'm going to a different county for a funeral.

8,1e7il2k,AITA for reporting a maintenance issue to property management?,"I live in an apartment complex that is about 40 years old. So things break and need fixed as any property would. The management is picky about having things in shared spaces and has done a whole initiative to make the outside of the buildings and the hallways look more modern and consistent. They send emails about the smallest little “infractions” to include bird feeding and outdoor chairs.

My neighbors and I have a group text where we share if there are any issues we are experiencing such as electrify or hot water issues and often one will create the report when a building problem.

One time my neighbors had a plumbing issues and it flooded my unit. It took days to clean up but I chalked it up to apartment living. They apologized profusely and I really did not even think it was their fault. I later learned that they’d installed a bidet that the complex did not authorize and they were chastized by maintenance about it, I don’t know if that contributed to the plumbing issue.

We have all been friendly and exchange niceties whenever we cross paths. We have shared meals. Generally nice neighbors things. I’ve shared various herb cuttings from my kitchen garden that I thought they might enjoy cooking with and they decided to propagate and start growing them.

This year they got more interested in growing vegetables in containers and put them outside. I contributed to their new interest with some growing vegetables that I came across while at a farm store and they were thrilled.

The property management saw the early growth and asked them to stop. They found some line in the lease that allowed for a small amount of blooming plants so the management left them alone. Since then they have expanded their garden and asked to place things close to my windows. I don’t own the outdoors or use those areas so did not mind.

Recently we had rainstorms and while walking in the building I noticed a large hole where the ground had eroded under the concreter patio slab and the corner of the brick building. It was about 8 inches deep and 6 inches wide. I was alarmed and sent a message to the group chat since I didn’t want anyone to step in it or have their pet in the area where a foot or leg might get hurt, but the main concern was a potential structural impact on the shared building.

I sent a request and the management fixed the issue. Once it was completed they sent an email asking that whoever had plants move them in 4 days or they would toss them.

My neighbor was furious and said the hole was not my problem and that had something happened the property management would have to fix the building and compensate us for any inconvenience. I had no idea that the plants were in danger if maintenance were called to inspect the area but really did not think of that because there was a huge hole that I felt was a risk to the entire building.

I later learned that they’d installed a bidet that the complex did not authorize and they were chastized by maintenance about it, I don’t know if that contributed to the plumbing issue.

We have all been friendly and exchange niceties whenever we cross paths. We have shared meals. Generally nice neighbors things. I’ve shared various herb cuttings from my kitchen garden that I thought they might enjoy cooking with and they decided to propagate and start growing them.

This year they got more interested in growing vegetables in containers and put them outside. I contributed to their new interest with some growing vegetables that I came across while at a farm store and they were thrilled.

The property management saw the early growth and asked them to stop. They found some line in the lease that allowed for a small amount of blooming plants so the management left them alone. Since then they have expanded their garden and asked to place things close to my windows. I don’t own the outdoors or use those areas so did not mind.

Recently we had rainstorms and while walking in the building I noticed a large hole where the ground had eroded under the concreter patio slab and the corner of the brick building. It was about 8 inches deep and 6 inches wide. I was alarmed and sent a message to the group chat since I didn’t want anyone to step in it or have their pet in the area where a foot or leg might get hurt, but the main concern was a potential structural impact on the shared building.

I sent a request and the management fixed the issue. Once it was completed they sent an email asking that whoever had plants move them in 4 days or they would toss them.

My neighbor was furious and said the hole was not my problem and that had something happened the property management would have to fix the building and compensate us for any inconvenience. I had no idea that the plants were in danger if maintenance were called to inspect the area but really did not think of that because there was a huge hole that I felt was a risk to the entire building.

He calls me a fat pig, tells me that Im ugly and says I shouldn’t eat so much, he has never apologized for it. He once broke my arm (I don’t blame him it was an accident) but instead of apologizing or helping me, he fucking laughed at me for crying. He is also racist, homophobic and transphobic. So today I woke up at 3 pm. Usually when I wake up this late I don’t eat a big lunch so I’ll still be hungry for dinner. So I only ate a cinnamon roll and went back to my room. Me and my brother eat different things at lunch since he is a picky eater. He only wants my dad to buy this specific Danish dessert/ breakfast for him that he eats for lunch. He is very happy with this and doesn’t want anything else. I really like those Korean Buldak noodles but they recently got banned in Denmark so i stocked up on them before the ban to eat for lunch. A little more context is that a while ago before the ban my brother also took my buldak noodles, that time I caught him and I didn’t get mad so I just showed him how to make them properly. later I came to see if he liked them only for him to think they were too spicy (which I had warned him about) and that he just didn’t like the flavor. So today he comes into my room at 5pm, while my dad was already in here, he is completely orange around his mouth. My dad asks if he ate the noodles and he says yes. So I tell him that he’s a bitch for doing that since they no longer sell them. And he just says “ok?”. 2 hours later at dinner I make a joke that he can’t possibly be hungry already. He doesn’t find this very funny and starts grumbling. I ask if he ate it as a soup because that’s what it looked like in the kitchen, and he says that he did. So now I’m also kinda angry that he took my food and didn’t even eat it properly. I tell him that I think he’s an asshole for eating my discontinued lunch, and that I never ever eat his food since I know that’s all he eats and it would be disrespectful.

This story starts 5months ago when I(20NB) want to create a DND campaign. My best friend (21F) is really interested in it (even tho she found the book I wrote ""boring af"") .I propose the campaign to her and her friends. We talked a few times before cause they also do DND .
So I propose it to them,create the server with the help of one of them and start creating a tutorial for how to create a character sheet,cause I knew with the different timezones (I'm in Europe ,they're American) we couldn't really vc to create it .But I told them ""if you have ANYTHING to ask/ say to me or if you need help DM me and I'll help you or ask for a vc and we'll see that together"" .

A few months pass and I pinged them multiple times to see if they progressed ,no one answered. One night ,I had a shitty day and my best friend ask me if the campaign is still on, I told her ""welp ,we'll see"" I pinged an everyone to see if anyone was still interested (at this point only my best friend created their sheet and no one had sent me a dm or asked a vc so I thought everything was good cause no answer to my pings). And one of the players sent me a dm telling me they're not interested anymore cause they thought the campaign was abandoned and that I wasn't involved in it. Explained to her that I pinged them multiple times asking if they needed help. Her excuse was that I didn't Dmed them properly,saying that I should have dm-ed them personally to do their sheet together.And she starts ranting about how in her 15years of experience they always did like this and bla bla blah .
Honestly,didn't read it fully ,left her on read,banned them from the server and sent a screenshot of the DL in the server saying that the campaign was over cause I didn't want bored players ,calling them ""dead weights""
My best friend said that it was a two part problem,how I miscommunicated with them and that the campaign should still be played ,told her no ,I couldn't play with people that are not passionate about the universe I created from endless nights on caffeine ,which I put blood sweat and tears to create a DND campaign,and banned her as well as the rest of her friends.

She texted me saying that I was overreacting and the campaign could still be played if everyone made peace and forgot the past.

Most people in my class are very religious, for example they'll post edits of gods on their social media, draw them all the time, etc. One day I was talking to my friend that we'll call ""red"" and her friend group. From that conversation they got to know that I was agnostic (they didn't understand what agnostic meant so I just told them I'm an atheist). After that red has been somewhat passive aggressive with me but I shrugged it off. For example once this bossy classmate raised her voice at me for no reason and I started to tear up (it was completely unintentional, it's a reaction I cannot control that happens because of previous bad experiences). I tried to hide it and red said ""cry more"" in a passive aggressive tone. There have been more instances like this. She has been so rude after I told her that I'm agnostic and I didn't realise it was because of that until the following conversation.

So our school decided to take us to watch a movie. It was an illogical cash grab. It was very fast paced with so many colourful bright colours and loud music it was like live-action cocomelon. In one scene it was clearly shown that a character had died, there's no way that character could have made it out alive a fucking helicopter fell on that mf and we were shown him dying on camera. 
Then after a bit that character randomly appears out of nowhere and it was so illogical.

I told red ""how tf did that character come out of nowhere it was made so clear that he died, a motherfucking plane fell on top of him??""
I thought she would just laugh and agree with me but she got aggressive and started saying ""it's because of God! Anything can happen with their power, you won't understand because you're an atheist""
This was out of nowhere considering this movie had nothing to do with God? I literally said nothing about God? If it was a religious film and it was clearly implied the character was revived by a god then her reaction would be understandable, but it's just poor writing. You cannot just blame completely illogical writing with ""it happened because of God!"".

This made me realise that the reason she had been so passive aggressive with me this whole time was because I was agnostic 

What makes this even more funny is that  I literally follow her religion better than her even though I don't believe in it, like taking any life/consciousness away is always going to be a sin in her religion yet she still eats meat but I'm vegetarian because of health religion so I find this ironic as fuck. Being mean to others in any circumstance is also forbidden in her religion yet she here she is.

Edit: so his aunt arranged the Airbnb. She assigned the rooms and the chores. She has made other comments to me on this trip that have made me feel bad about myself. 

Husband just came in after being outside talking with his family for the last hour and he won't go into details but said that we will be staying but if they say one more comment or if I feel any more discomfort we will be leaving. 

(We want to stay as we have some fun events that we don't want our child missing out on tomorrow and Monday)

Final update : so this morning while getting ready the cousins gf came and spoke to me said that what they said was completely wrong and disrespectful and that she doesn't believe what they said about me. (made me very happy)

Anyway as we were heading out to go hiking his aunt couldn't help herself i guess and said at least I don't look like i belong on a pole like I did yesterday. My 5 yr old yelled at her and said to stop being mean to my mommy before we could say anything. My husband had a few choice words for her infront of everyone.

Out of 6 of us 4 are in committed relationship and I'm not one of the (This will be important later). This trip was in planning for 6 years, we wanted to go somewhere from the first year of college and finally after 2 years in corporate job we were finally able to afford and decide on a trip. I won't go into much details but I really wanted to emphasis that this trip meant a lot to us (at least to me).

We had decided to book 3 2-occupent hotel rooms for a week but last Tuesday ( about 2 weeks before the trip), One of our friend (let's call him larry) said that he wanted to bring his girlfriend along for the trip. I tried to explain to him that it wouldn't be possible because we have done all the as for 6 people only and bringing even one more person would would require change in plans, add a lot to the cost and why the hell he want to bring his girlfriend to our trip (she isn't even a part of our friend group). This led to a lot bickering between us all and the only agreeable solution that came out was that we'll would chip in a bit extra (500 bucks) and rest of the changes and cost larry and his girlfriend would take care. 

While all other were okay with this decision, I wasn't because I kind off have a history with larry's girlfriend because I used to share my apartment with larry during college. and she would be there for at least 3 days a week. and we would get in fights a lot because she would try to act like my mother. Interrupting me every time I'm cooking , cleaning and even when I'm eating, to teach me how to got it the correct way.  And when I tell her to f\*\*k off, she replied in condescending time: ""That's why you don't have a girlfriend"". Due to this I moved out of that apartment and She moved in with larry instead. 

Despite all this I was still ready to go. But yesterday, our 3 other committed friend said that they would have to bring their girlfriend too. If larry's girlfriend is coming they'll be bring their girlfriend too, because it would be weird for them to be going with a girl to a trip despite being in a committed relation. While, we were still discussing this larry's girlfriend joined and said that would be great idea and they all should join too. I was/am strongly against this idea because I wanted it to be boys trip. And I didn't wanted to a 3rd wheel the whole trip. So, I gave larry the ultimatum that either his girlfriend is going or me. To which larry responded that he can't come without his girlfriend. So, I said then you'll should go this couples trip this time and I won't be coming. and exited the call.

19,1e8892z,AITA for beginning to despise my mother?,"some background. I am a 22F currently obtaining a bachelors degree. Of course my parents decided on my career choice so I had to pursue it if I wanted to live under their roof. P.S. in our culture it is frowned upon if you move out before marriage.

For as long I can remember, my mom has created such a suffocating environment. She hated any and every friend I made in school, I simply cannot go on a walk without her following me with her car, she attends all doctors appointments with me, and gives me no privacy.

I do not even have my own bank account access, she asks for receipts when I purchase something, stalks my credit statements, reviews my call log history, and I am not allowed to have social media.

She also comments on my looks and makes me feel insecure by pointing to my arms and telling me where exactly I should lose weight.

Best of all, she thought I once conspired w the hospital into changing my lab test results when actually the website had an outage. My mom made a three way call with the company and me. They lady on the other line was genuinely concerned for my wellbeing while trying to deal w my mom.

I recently broke up with my bf because he became controlling and verbally abusive due to stress and his own insecurities.

He would stalk my location, not allow me to wear crop tops, leggings, would be upset if I had male coworkers or male instructors etc.

For the majority of the relationship my mom inserted herself into our relationship A LOT and always gave her two cents.

One day I left my apple watch at home and my sister somehow knew the passcode and started reading explicit text messages between me and my bf...she even showed my mom and they both slut shamed me together for a good 2 months (still do). I found this to be a huge invasion of privacy

My mom always wanted to have him over, would constantly talk about him (not even ask about my life...) while we were together.

Also, my mom demands to know where I am at all times (e.g. expects my location to be shared to her iphone).

When my ex and I were breaking up/discussing the topic of break up on campus ( i had told my mom that I was going to stay on campus to talk to him) my mom had the audacity to drive 45 mins and follow my location to the exact bench we were sitting on and inserted herself into the conversation...

I was appalled. How can my own mother embarrass me like this? Is she in the relationship or am i?

Anyways she started getting loud, asking what we were arguing about and my ex bf had to tell her to lower her voice because their were people around.

It was a gong show and I was so embarrassed to say the least.

I thought through everything and finalized the break up because I do not want the generational trauma I experienced to continue into my future married life.

As for my mom, i do love her, but the narcissism and wanting full control of my life has utterly destroyed me. 

I enrolled into therapy however my mom has created such a suffocating environment. SHE EVEN WANTS TO ATTEND THERAPY SESSIONS WITH ME...

They soon realised they had trauma, and thus weren't ready for a relationship. However, we ended up going on a date. They attempted to kiss me, but I turned them down despite having feelings for them. Afterwards, for a short while, we tried to keep the friendship going, but they apparently felt very guilty about the date. They suddenly stopped talking to me for unknown reasons. (At one point, I had learned that they have a habit of cutting contact with people based on their own insecurities.) Soon after, I learned from a mutual friend (15m) that they had told him a twisted version of the story, in which I had tried to kiss them and they had backed out.

After about 6 months of the ignoring, my best friend (14NB) helped me to reach out to them and rekindle the friendship. I asked my former friend about the story I had heard from our mutual friend, and they promised that was not what they had said and they didn't know what happened. Although I did not believe them, I decided to forgive and forget on the condition that they talked to our friend to tell him the real story. For a while after that, we had a very close friendship, and I began to develop feelings again.

However, when I invited our mutual friend over, I learned that he still thought I had tried to kiss my friend and my feelings were unrequited. Later, I texted them and asked about it again, and they insisted that they didn't know what happened and that they had already talked to our friend about it. I did not believe them, and said I had to ask again, because I was inclined to believe that they did know where he had gained his misconceptions. They read but did not reply to that message, and I deleted the message because I felt bad.

The next morning, I texted to apologize for instantly assuming they were lying without considering that they could have just forgotten, and they did not read it. I suspected that they were ignoring me again, and so a week after that, I texted them again to make sure. After another week of ignoring, I reached out to my cousin (20f) for advice on how to make the situation right, and she thought my former friend was not considering my feelings at all, that shutting down all contact was rude and borderline manipulative, and that I was not in the wrong for not blindly trusting them after hearing that they'd told stories behind my back. She advised me to firmly ask for an explanation and to not explain myself first.

I asked the mutual friend mentioned earlier to tell them that ""as this may be the last time I speak to them, I am deeply saddened and disappointed that I have been left no choice but to use a friend as a messenger, and that I truly want to clear up and address any issues between them and I for both of our closure.

We saw him in June when he played at a venue in Nashville and we got to meet him. He’s very nice and we love his music.

Tonight she’s seeing him again in Franklin (a suburb of Nashville). He’s also going on tour this fall and he’s gonna be in Nashville again on September 1. So since her birthday is on August 2, I thought about surprising her with tickets to the Sep 1 show (they’re only like $20 and the VIP is only $75 which isn’t bad at all) and making it a joint celebration for both of our birthdays since mine is on Aug 31.

So today me and my mom were thinking of each a present to get her (my mom wants to get her something too) and I brought up the idea. She objected to it even though I told her Kylie would really like it. 

But I’m thinking about going behind her back and getting the tickets anyway because I know Kylie will like it (Kayko has even replied to several of her stories on Instagram where she’s reposted his tour announcements and stuff).

I received a text from my aunt's neighbor askinge to come over, she's a sweetheart who's always helping me, and I was going home (two hours away) the next day, so I decided to go next door quickly to see what's up. We got carried away talking about some really important stuff and I came back later than expected, and when I did, everyone else was tipsy.   I just sat back with them. When my mom's cousin was going home, before she left she mentioned jokingly about a trip to Dubai, and when I said ""oh, were going to Dubai?"" My mom, sister and the cousin said not me, that I wasn't invited cause I wasn't there when we were talking. I took everything as a joke, cause we're NOT financially good, so it's impossible to even think about such a trip. 
Yesterday my sister and mom asked me to write something down in a shared calendar we have, and then write down another thing and another, I notice practically immediately that ""Trip to Dubai"". I was shocked and super excited bit wanted to tease them about not noticing until I couldn't anymore. I asked ""so we're going to Dubai?"". Their faces fell, and they told me I wasn't going, that it was the same month I start a important job and that it all happened so fast...

27,1e86skg,WIBTA if I didn't cancel all of my weekend plans to go to my great grandmother's funeral that's just now happening well over a year after her death,"My (M20) great grandmother died around a year and a half to two years ago now, she was around 96 or so. I did not have much of a relationship with her growing up, she was aware that I existed and I was aware she existed. That's pretty much it. She never had a funeral around the time of her death, I think because of covid concerns but I don't remember why. Once a very long time ago I was told there would be a funeral later, but was not given a date and it wasn't mentioned since.  

Anyways, a week from now I have plans to attend an event with my friends and girlfriend that I already paid in advance for a few weeks ago. I was not made aware of anything happening that weekend, so my schedule seemed clear. Fast forward to yesterday night, my dad texts me asking if I am going to this funeral. I tell him that I am probably not, since I was not made aware of this beforehand and that I'm sorry that I can't be there but I wish he said something sooner so that I could've planned around it. He then tells me that this is more important than whatever I have planned. I respond by reminding him that I was at a family wedding just last month where he or any other family members could have mentioned this to me so that I could put it onto my calendar. This upsets him, and I'm given a passive aggressive and sarcastic ""Don't worry about it."" I decided to stop responding and keep going about my day. 

Today, my mom texts me also asking me to go to this funeral as to not piss off my family even though my great grandma and I were never close. I have not responded since I do not want to touch the situation since I feel like no matter what I answer, if it's not an enthusiastic ""Yes! I will cancel everything for you and go!"" then I will just upset people further. 

WIBTA for not cancelling my plans? My great grandma has been dead for years now, so it's not like she just died and everyone is in shock and grieving. I'm frustrated because I wouldn't have made plans in the first place if somebody had just told me sooner that this funeral is happening on this date and that they want me to be there. This is not a case of me deliberately not caring. I already feel guilty enough for not being able to make it, and my parents being this upset with me makes it worse.

28,1e86jyf,AITA for not letting my step-brother bring his gf to my Bachelor party?,"This is happening right now and it's very stressful and annoying. So my brother Brad called me a few months ago and pretty much forced me to have a bachelor party whether I wanted to or not... which is fine because my fiance had one so it could be a fun little vacation. So we decided to go to the Ozarks because my step-brother Nate has RV's and boats down there so it would be cheaper and something I haven't done before.

So the original Bachelor party at the ozarks gets cancelled because my brother Brad messed up the dates and I had to cancel our flights and lost about $140. Very annoying but what am I supposed to do, honestly at this point of cancelling the whole thing and just say we tried, but our other friend Louis calls me and says we can throw it at his house in Florida and do a weekend trip. This actually does sound fun for me because we'll have real beds and a house with AC and a whole city to party in. So we call my brother Brad and set it all up and everyone is ready to go, except the date has to be a certain time because my step brother Nate can only get that time off from his kids and work... NBD we hold it off a month and are good to go.

Louis puts out a group chat confirming the party for everyone and we're all on board and this time I actually kind of want to go... Not even a full 3 minutes later my step brother Nate brings up the fact he has to bring his GF, saying ""don't give him lip"" and that she will ""pull more girls then all of us""... Immediately Louis is like Wtf why would she come in the group chat and Nate then goes on to say like he had a bad marriage before and he never wants to not spend a night without her... and that's as vulnerable as he gets (he actually said that). So Louis continues to be like nah that's crazy and then they both ask me and I simply say it's supposed to be a bros trip.

Nate then texts me separately and tells me it doesn't matter just let me know what I want. So I say to him that i'm sure she is cool but I just want a bros trip (its a f*cking Bachelor party smh) and then he says ok. Three hours later he sends me a new text about how disappointed he is in me and a simple thank you would of went a long way for what he and my other brother have done for me. I guess on the original bachelor party he rented a party but that all got cancelled, which I don't even want, but it got cancelled because my brother messed up dates. So now he's acting like he's mad that I'm not grateful enough for the trip that hasn't even happened yet, which clearly is just him being bitter about not being able to bring his gf. I do not text him back and then text the group chat back with some jokes and memes to kind of change the subject and joke around. Nate is the only one to not joke back in the group chat.

31,1e86dtm,AITA for giving advice to others when I don’t have a perfect life myself?,"Last night, while doing my homework, I was going off track losing motivation and decided to join a voice chat (VC) with people from my Free Company (FC) in an MMO I play. This FC is new to me, so I thought it was a good opportunity to meet them and have body doubles for motivation. I first started playing the game with my bf, but as we had more kids, he stopped playing due to his demanding ""raiding"" commitments. I stopped playing too because I was scared to play alone and was not good at being social. Recently, feeling alone, I decided to play the game again, which my bf has seemed sensitive about. He refuses to play with me, spending all his free time on Elden Ring (though he’s cleared it three times), despite my suggestion that we play together. Instead of always relying on him I’ve been becoming more independent and so continue to play. 

In the VC, I noticed some members arguing about a long-standing issue. They introduced themselves and explained the dynamics within the five of them, including relationships (two gay couples and one single they).

I mediated the discussion, sharing insights about demand avoidance, differences in expectations, and how their communication styles might be causing misunderstandings.

It was nearing 3 AM, and my bf, who had apparently been awake, began berating me, demanding I be up early with the toddlers and calling me a liar, narcissist, and fake.

This continued into the next day, with him accusing me of being fake and spending too much time worrying about “a bunch of gay guys problems” when our relationship is far from perfect. Even our 4yo daughter asked him to stop and finally suggested we go to the park with my 3yo son so dad couldn’t talk to me anymore.

I tried to explain that helping others is about empathy and trying to prevent them from learning things the hard way, despite my own struggles. Even telling him about a message I received after from one of them thanking me for making them feel like there’s nothing wrong with them and allowing them to take a different look and approach to their mental health. He dismissed this, continuing to berate me, causing our daughter to glare at him.

TLDR: I gave advice to people younger than me about relationship dynamics, mental health and personal priorities and growth despite my own struggles, and my bf thinks it was wrong of me to do so.

Last night, while doing my homework, I was going off track losing motivation and decided to join a voice chat (VC) with people from my Free Company (FC) in an MMO I play. This FC is new to me, so I thought it was a good opportunity to meet them and have body doubles for motivation. I first started playing the game with my bf, but as we had more kids, he stopped playing due to his demanding ""raiding"" commitments. I stopped playing too because I was scared to play alone and was not good at being social. Recently, feeling alone, I decided to play the game again, which my bf has seemed sensitive about. He refuses to play with me, spending all his free time on Elden Ring (though he’s cleared it three times), despite my suggestion that we play together. Instead of always relying on him I’ve been becoming more independent and so continue to play. 

In the VC, I noticed some members arguing about a long-standing issue. They introduced themselves and explained the dynamics within the five of them, including relationships (two gay couples and one single they). As they argued, I recognized a pattern similar to my experiences with ADHD and ASD. I asked if I could offer support, and they agreed.

32,1e85z1l,AITA for telling my mom I can’t talk to her because I won’t win from it ,"I 20(f) currently live with my parents. Little context if this helps I’m Hispanic, and I feel like my mom can be pretty toxic most of the time. We tend to have an okay relationship but I know they see me as the troubled child because I talk back and don’t really talk to them much on a daily basis. 

However, earlier today when I was getting ready for work I put on some cargo pants. They were a bit wrinkled on the bottom but you can’t notice it that much without staring it down for a bit. This is where my mom comes in and tells me to go change or iron my pants. I go ahead in a nice tone and say thanks but I’ll wear these pants as is. Since they didn’t look that wrinkled to me. My mom continues on till she starts getting frustrated. She got the iron and told me to take the pants off and she will iron it , I said no thank you again and went off with what I was doing.

She didn’t like that answer and proceeded to scream at me to give her the pants and I kept my cool of course and said mom no thank you I’ll wear it as is. As I was running around for my things she said it again and I got tired of it and changed pants. She asked me where my pants are and I said I changed so you didn’t have to iron them. Then she blew up on me and I left the house mad. 

I got to work etc… she had apparently texted me during my shift and I got to text her back during my lunch break and she was all mad saying “oh now you’re gonna ignore me” and I answered back I was working sorry I can’t be on the phone while on the floor. And told her “either way I can’t talk to you because I never win “ “you get mad at me for everything I say” . Which she proceed to say “that really came out of your mouth , okay I’m not surprised but okay “.

35,1e85e1i,AITA for Setting Boundaries with My In-Laws?,"Hi everyone,

I’m in a bit of a tricky situation and need some perspective. My partner (30F) and I (29M) have been married for two years, and things have generally been great. However, there’s been a recurring issue with my in-laws that’s causing some tension.

My in-laws are lovely people, but they have a habit of dropping by unannounced. It started off as occasional visits, which were fine, but it has become more frequent. They live nearby and seem to think it’s okay to come over whenever they want. My wife is used to this because it’s how she grew up, but for me, it’s becoming overwhelming. I value our privacy and enjoy having our own space.

A few weeks ago, I decided to address the issue. I politely asked my in-laws if they could give us a heads-up before visiting, explaining that we need some time to ourselves and to prepare for guests. They seemed to understand and agreed initially.

However, since then, my mother-in-law has made several passive-aggressive comments about us being “too busy” for family and how we’re “keeping them at arm’s length.” My wife feels caught in the middle and while she understands my perspective, she also doesn’t want to upset her parents.

Last weekend, things came to a head when they showed up unannounced again. I was frustrated and reiterated our need for boundaries. My mother-in-law left in a huff, and now there’s a noticeable strain between us.

I’m starting to feel like the bad guy here. I never wanted to create a rift, but I also believe in setting healthy boundaries. So, AITA for insisting on some notice before my in-laws visit?

**Edit for Additional Context:**

* We both work from home, so unannounced visits disrupt our workflow.
* We’ve suggested setting up regular, planned visits to spend quality time together, but they prefer spontaneity.
* I’ve always been respectful in my requests and have tried to communicate openly and honestly.

He goes out a lot but he's painfully shy. Don't get me wrong, I'm not criticizing, I  genuinely find it so cute, but this is the way it is.

Two days ago, it was his birthday. On his previous birthday, his (now long-distance) best friend and I set up a mini birthday party for him. It was just the three of us, and he LOVED it.

Now, as his friend has moved away, it was going to be just the two of us. He told me he's sad his best friend couldn't join, but he's happy to have my company. I was flattered but wanted to do something more for him. I planned a surprise birthday party and decided this time it was going to be something bigger, so I invited all my friends and told them to bring their partners as well.

Long story short, it didn't end well. At all. He got extremely anxious and ran upstairs within 5 minutes. We had to end it before we could even give our presents.

After everyone left, I asked him what's wrong, and he lashed out at me. I was blamed for ruining his birthday, making him look stupid, and now everyone thinks he's a freak. I tried to reassure him and told him no one thinks that, it's all in his head. I guess I accidentally made it worse, because after that he threw a whole tantrum. I couldn't take it anymore and had to leave.

Later on, he apologized for his reaction but also told me I should have known this wouldn't end well. I reminded him of the previous birthday party last year too, and he claimed it's not the same thing and told me to stop doubling down. What I did was inconsiderate and right now i'm being an AH by not owning up to it.

He has tried to find a work from home job but he’s struggling right now. Which I know is legit because I have been looking for him too. 

Am I the asshole here? I love him a ton and he treats me very well. We get along great with everything else and he didn’t choose to have this health issue, but I am just tired of living in a messy house and paying for everything. I just want some help. ",0.0,-0.006551145575940609,0,1
41,1e84m26,AITA for telling my parents and stepparents they never asked me for my opinion on my stepparents being real or equal parents?,"My parents divorced when I (16f) was 5 and my younger sister was 2 and my younger brother was 8 months old. My parents met my stepparents by the time I was 7 and I met both of them age 8 and they married them when I was 9/10. For a few years now there have been some fights on both sides when it comes to parenting. These discussions have been about me more frequently because I have mental health struggles and it needs more discussing than my siblings lives.

Something that has been an issue of late is my mom not feeling my stepmom should have a say because she's not my parent and dad feeling the same about my stepdad. Dad gets mad on stepmom's behalf and stepmom gets mad too. And mom gets mad on stepdad's behalf and stepdad gets mad too. I have been aware of this fight between them but stayed out of it mostly.

Truth is I don't consider my stepparents equal parents to my mom and dad and I don't consider them just as much my real parents. My younger siblings do. But I never did. And this was how I felt *before* the adults started fighting.

The other night my dad and stepmom came over after we were meant to be in bed so they could talk to my mom and stepdad and a fight kicked off about this very topic. I heard them when I was up to go to the bathroom and I went downstairs and heard them fight about whether this was just a mom and dad talk or whether the steps should be a part of it. I interrupted and told them they'd wake my siblings and should really stop fighting over it because it was getting old. I told them they never asked me my opinion on whether my stepparents were my equal parents or my real parents or whatever and they could save themselves a lot of fighting. My dad told me my opinion wasn't what counted because I'm a teen and don't understand parenting enough at my age. But my stepdad and my stepmom looked at me like they wanted to know and my stepdad asked how I felt. So I told them. I said whenever I talk about my parents I talk about mom and dad, and not the four of them. And they were the only people I considered my real or equal parents or whatever. Because they're equal to each other and my stepparents are different.

Nobody liked what I said and they told me I was wrong to try and insert myself into the conversation and to act like my opinion held so much weight.

The frame on her car rusted and became too dangerous to drive and she cannot afford to by a new car (not a cheap used car or financing because she has no credit). I told her she could borrow my car until she figures something out. The work week hasn’t been an issue; she drops me off at work in the morning and picks me up in the evening since I get off several hours after she does. 
The issue has been on weekends. I let her have the spare key so we wouldn’t have to constantly be swapping the key back and forth. Recently she has started taking my car without asking. It started out with her just saying she was going to run to the store or something and leaving without asking if she could use my car. It annoyed me but I didn’t think much of it. Now she will take my car without a word, leaving before I’m up in the morning and not bothering to check if I have plans. She’s also making us go through more gas. She does help pay for gas (we take turns filling it up) but we’re needing gas every other day instead of the 1-2 times a week I would usually fill up. 
The final straw was her taking my car today without asking and making me miss a friend’s baby shower (I live an hour from the venue and was no able to find someone to give me a ride without also making them late to the shower).

43,1e84af3,AITA for telling my wife I don't want spoilers?,"hello reddit, thanks for indulging me.

here are two things pertinent to this conversation. (1) my spouse and I watch exactly one show together every night. We have a small night snack and sit together and enjoy ourselves. (2) my spouse has a very hard time ""holding"" information. Gotten way better at it over the years, but there's still a trickle-truth habit - *hint* and then *hint harder*.

so we're watching a show that's very popular right now, and my spouse follows all the actors in insta so got something spoiled. 

here's how the conversation went, this is pretty close to exact:

>>something happened on [show]!

>okay, I don't want to know, I want to watch. 

>>I got it spoiled for me on insta.

>okay we're watching tonight, and stop following them if you're getting spoiled! 

>>SOMEONE DIES!

and I snapped, because I thought ""I don't want to know, I want to watch"" was pretty clear! But the counterargument is that we should be on the same page while we watch, and either way it's not really a big deal because it's just a show. But it's kind of a big deal to me?

then we ended up having a medium-sized argument because there's a small confounding variable: my spouse has a mild disorder in which one common symptom is that sometimes words tend to come faster than the impulse to stop them. and like I get that but I don't think it's too much to ask to NOT have spoilers for the show.

44,1e847nk,AITA for asking my boyfriend to not watch reels/tiktoks while I’m driving?,"I 22F have been with my bf 23M for over 2 years. This has always been an issue where I have asked him time after time to not play memes in the car. To elaborate what I mean, I’m mainly talking about Instagram reels. 

Sounds when they are coming from something I’m not focused on or when it’s coming from one ear I find sometimes overstimulating but always find irritating and distracting. It’s the last thing I want to feel when I’m driving. My bf does not just watch a couple reels and then stop. If that were the case I could make myself tolerate a couple minutes of annoying noise. He watches them most of the time the whole drive even if it’s more than 20 minutes. I have said put the volume down all the way or just use earbuds. Even slight noise bugs me, so him keeping the volume low doesn’t help. I am the same with our TV at bedtime. When I’m sleeping I need no sound even it its barely audible it bugs me. I’ve been like that since I was a child, so I don’t think me asking him to not play reels while I drive is random. There are other sounds that trigger me as well day to day which I have been vocal about with him. 

He’s ADHD and he says he needs to be doing something which I definitely understand but I don’t think it has to be watching videos with the volume on while I’m driving. We’ve had a lot of arguments in the car because of it. I usually end up asking him to turn down his volume and he usually turns it down a bit but I have to keep bugging him to get him to put it down enough for me to not hear it. It gets me irritated and I end up being rude to him. I have only done the same to him a handful of times, but I don’t think it bothers him so in turn he doesn’t think it should bother me and that just might be how his brain thinks. I have tried just leaving it be but it makes my blood boil and I’m always so irritated and bothered when we get to our destination. I usually feel overstimulated and hate interacting with him after.

I do like to listen to my music while I drive, but I don’t blare it. When he controls the music with his phone while I’m the one driving however he doesn’t play any insta reels but we always gone by the driver controls the music. Sometimes I make the compromise of him controlling the music just so I can drive without getting irritated, but I want to listen to my music when I drive because I rarely get to pick a song when he drives. Our music taste doesn’t really align all the time. I want to listen to my music while I drive without extra noise the entire drive. The videos he scrolls through usually have audio that I don’t really know how to describe better than being loud and annoying rather than a video of someone talking calmly.

50,1e82lf2,AITA for refusing to clean up my boyfriend's dog's poop ? ,"I (25M) have been living with my boyfriend (24M) for over an year at this point. Shortly after we moved in together my boyfriend has gotten a dog even tho I made him clear to him that I don't like dogs and I don't want to take care of one. Well my boyfriend said that he'll be the only one to take care of him and I don't need to worry about it. Well that was obviously I lie but whatever, I don't mind occasionally having to feed the dog or getting him to a walk, but what I absolutely refuse to do is clean up his poop (especially cause my boyfriend hasn't even pooty trained him yet).

Not only is the smell absolutely horrible but I know that with my OCD, I'd probably end up washing my hands for at least half an hour afterwards and that's even if any poop doesn't actually touch my skin. I absolutely gag at the thought of having to clean up dog poop so this is the one thing my boyfriend was fully responsible for (and also washing the place his dog pooped on). But for a couple of weeks my boyfriend started complaining to me about not helping clean up poop or even washing the place/help him pooty train the dog, but I reminded him that this is his dog which I didn't want and he'd promised me that he'll take full responsibility of him. 

Well his precious dog ended up pooping on our living room carpet and my boyfriend had a near mental breakdown where he started crying and saying he can't do this anymore and then begged me to clean it up this time cause he feels like he'll throw up if he has to clean one more poop. I reminded him about our agreement regarding the dog and he ended up screaming at me about how much of a selfish and lazy partner I am and after he finally cleaned up the carpet, he ended up calling his mother to complain about me so then she could lecture me herself about how much of a lazy leech I am and that I'm forcing her son to do everything around the house, which is a lie. 

Afterwards I told my boyfriend if he's so bent in involving his mommy to our arguments he could give the dog to her so she could clean up the poop after him and my boyfriend called me again an asshole.

51,1e8257f,AITA for trying to uninvite my mother-in-law on my honeymoon?,"My fiance and I decided to get married overseas and invited immediate family and close friends. Covid hit and we had to marry in the states, turning our previous non-refundable deposits into our honeymoon. It was an early call so all of our family/friends either assumed they were not going overseas or asked if they should still come? However, upon my fiance and I telling my soon-to-be mother in law the new situation, she acted as if it was expected that she and their family were still going. As the conversation went on she acted slighted and my fiance seeing this, reassured her, without speaking to me first, that she and the family could still come. Mind you, they had free-cancellation options booked. I was shocked. At this point we had not made any decisions, we were just letting our family and friends know the situation. He made this quick decision w/out me, in the moment.

I at least expected her behavior to be respectful and ask if they could still come and not treating our honeymoon as a family vacation. Long story short, they came and made their own stay-arrangements. My husband had set some boundaries and we did things on our own, but they were in communication with us, about doing meet-ups/dinner, etc. I also caught a weird vibe from her the whole time and she seemed distant, like she knew how I felt and didn't care. There wasn't even a 'cheers' to the new couple from her and thanking us for having them on our honeymoon! Now a couple years into our marriage my husband now overlooks all of this and says what a great time it was, trying to sugarcoat it. This ultimately has caused strain in our relationship from the get-go and my relationship with his mother. I've lost complete respect for her and since this moment my relationship with her has changed and I have proceeded with caution. Since this, other issues have occurred with her and I can't help but think, am I in the wrong for wanting to un-invite her from our honeymoon and hold my ground in my relationship?

My close family and friends have responded to this behavior as  mother-in-law over-reach and entitlement in my marriage. Someone to keep at a distance but cordial.

52,1e81wbn,AITA for telling off my dad for oinking at me?,"Throwaway account lol

Recently, I (18F) went on a long roadtrip with my parents and grandmother. The trip was planned primarily for my grandmother's enjoyment, as she recently turned eighty and has never really gone on a vacation before.

While we were driving back we stopped at a gas station for snacks. Apparently, I was eating extremely fast, because my dad thought it would be funny to turn towards me and start oinking at me while I was eating. I have always struggled with body image, something he knows, as I was bullied pretty badly for my weight in middle school and have several issues surrounding eating. 

I found this deeply hurtful, started crying, and told him that that was not a funny joke. It already takes a lot for me to eat around other people and things like that really don't help. He apologized, and I do think he was genuinely remorseful.

The issue started after we dropped my grandmother off at her house. My dad told me that while he was sorry, he wished that I hadn't told him off in front of his mom, as the conflict probably made her uncomfortable and ended the trip on a sour note. In retrospect I probably should have waited until after grandma was gone to tell him about how much what he did bothered me, as I don't want to make her hear my dad and I fight, but I also am a person who cries very easily and I'm not sure how much I would have been able to cover up my emotional reaction had I been thinking a little more clearly.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-20,"AITA for telling off my dad for oinking at me?

(Also I’m 19m and my university roommate is 19f)

It started with little things. My mug would be dirty in the sink (even though I hadn’t drank from it yet(and she had all hers available)), the snacks in my room were mysteriously dwindling, and my charger always in her room.

My roommate and I were never really close, we talk when we were bored and I dropped her off at a friend’s house once. She moved from one of the Carolinas to the university (I’ve seen people be tracked down from giving small details, so I won’t say the university name, just know it’s in the east states), so she doesn’t have a job yet (even though it’s been a year.(now that I think about it, I wonder how she paid for classes(probably her parents)) With all that in mind, I let her borrow a few things if she asked me, sometimes I say yes, sometimes I say no. though there were some times she took things without asking, when I asked her about it she apologized and gave it back.

But now there’s no warning, no asking, but she does give it back, but it is still INCREDIBLY inconvenient.

I need to call a friend and say that I can’t meet him. Guess what? Phone’s dead and the charger is gone with it nowhere in sight and she’s nowhere to be seen. I gotta go to my friend next dorm over and he texts my friend saying I can’t come. But the guy I was going to meet was already there!

THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY INCONVENIENCES SHE MAKES ME GO THROUGH.

Eventually after she goes too far and takes my water bottle, I have a chat with her. I start off by saying that I’ve been letting her borrow a lot of things and that I respect that she gives them back, but that I want to stop giving her things, or at least without her asking first. 

She responds with something along the lines of ‘but you always said thank you when I gave it back so I thought you had no problem with it.’ I tell her ‘I was fine with it until you stopped asking.’ We go back and forth, me expressing my requests and her defending her actions.

Eventually I ask her if she has a job, which she takes offense to. She goes on the offense and turns the questions on me, then it turns into an argument. Some accusations are thrown around, and eventually I storm off.

Since then we’ve been barely talking and when we are, it’s just arguments. I started locking my door and she stopped taking my stuff. For the most part.

58,1e80se0,WIBTA If I told my childhood best friend the truth about gathering cash together when she was dealing with a tough time?,"My childhood best friend, we'll call her Clair, recently lost her mom and had to fly to a different country for the funeral. Clair has a friend group from college that I know, and I’m particularly close to one of them, we'll call her Anna. I've met the rest of the group but I'm not very close with them.

To help Clair with her expenses, I suggested to Anna that we should start a group chat with the college friends to gather funds. Anna agreed and started a group chat to organize it. However, when she started the chat, she framed the idea as entirely hers. Everyone praised Anna for being so thoughtful, and she accepted the compliments without mentioning that the idea was initially mine.

When the money was finally gifted to Clair, she was very thankful and expressed her gratitude to Anna. Once again, my contribution wasn't acknowledged at all.

A few months have passed, and I'm in a difficult position. I want to talk to Clair because I feel like Anna stole my thunder. I don't want Clair to think I wasn’t thinking of her during such a tough time. At the same time, I don’t want to reopen old wounds for Clair or seem like I'm fishing for praise. My other friend group says I should let the sleeping dog lie but my parents think I should tell Clair.

So, would I be the asshole for feeling hurt and wanting to tell Clair the truth?

60,1e80nxy,AITA For Refusing To Personally Dress My Children In Outfits That My Husband Likes But I Don't? ,"Throwaway Account

I (32f) have two children, ""Theo"" (2m) and ""Chloe"" (0.8f) with my husband ""Todd"" (30m). I loathe neon colors. Absolutely cannot. It's great if other people like it but there is something about it for me that irks my soul. I refuse to wear it and therefore refuse to dress my children in it. Todd knows this and has given me stuff in neon whenever he wants to do a joke. Whatever, it's his money that I'm donating to Goodwill or tossing into the trash.

I've even told him explicitly that I will never love him enough to wear it for him, which he laughs off but I'm only half joking.

When Theo was born I wasn't as far as I would've liked to have been in my career but I got a promotion and now that I have the money I've been going a little overboard in dressing my kids up in cute outfits and taking pictures. Not to post on social media but for baby books and stuff. I blame my mom and grandma for this. One day while we were out as a family we came across a clothing store and I saw a cute little dress for my daughter so we went in to buy it. While there, on the clearance rack, there was this neon green one piece that caught my husband's eye.

He showed it to me and asked if this would fit Theo. I just stared at him and told Todd to LOOK at our son and then look at what he was holding and he accurately determined that it was too small but then said it looked like it would fit Chloe perfectly. It does look it would but I wasn't gonna tell him. Todd asked if we could get it and I gave a quick and firm ""No,"" but when he asked why I simply said that I wasn't going to dress ""my daughter"" in that and told him to put it back. That's what triggered the ""she's my daughter too"" argument. I just walked away, paid for the clothes I wanted, and went to the car.

My husband met us there and he bought the damn thing. I sighed and decided to relent and Todd felt victorious. Fast forward to next week and we're getting ready to go to a family outing as I'm getting ready Todd tells me that he would like Chloe to wear the neon green outfit and I told him ""okay."" About an hour later we're at the door and I ask him where's Chloe and Todd looks at me confused. Since Todd told me he wanted her to wear the outfit I assumed he'd be the one to dress her in it but then he reminded me that I was the one who usually dressed the kids.

I looked at him and told Todd that if I have to go back and get Chloe ready I wasn't going to her in that outfit and that he would also have to wash it to make sure it would never go ""missing."" Todd got upset and told me that I was undermining his rights as a father. I told him that he clearly didn't care if our daughter wore that outfit because he was unwilling to dress her himself. This led to an argument and we didn't go out. Since it wasn't my side of the family I wasn't too angry but's been a few days and Todd's still upset AITA?

ETA: I was away but now that I'm back and keep seeing the same questions/comments I'll add some more info.

  
At the store Todd wanted me to pay for the neon outfit, not ""us,"" just me. 

In the 2 years that we have been parents Todd has only dress Theo 5 times. Never dresses Chloe.

UPDATE:  I appreciate all the feedback and points of view. It has helped me see that while I acted with good intentions, I only considered how the gesture made ME feel. I have texted a sincere apology to my son and will do better in the future.



My son is a college student and he's been away from the Summer  doing a news internship a couple of states away.

Last week he turned 21, and I hated the thought of him being in a strange city with no loved ones around, going through his day at work as though it were any other day. 21 is a big one!

I sent a tip to the news tip line at the paper where his internship is and simply wrote ""Your intern _____ ______
is turning 21 today! Tell him happy birthday!""  

Apparently the editor received the tip in the morning news meeting and announced it amidst the expected cheers and congratulations.

My son is enraged. He said I humiliated him and destroyed all the work he has done to appear a mature, independent adult. He spoke to me in a way I would never speak to my parent (not the first time). 

I have since received a very nice email from his editor telling me how fun that was and how much they have appreciated having my son with them this Summer, so I don't think I caused any damage as my son claims. 

I am devastated. I acted out of love and have received hate and anger in return. I seriously don't think I did anything wrong, but perhaps my perspective is skewed.

66,1e7zxo0,AITA For yelling at my GF and making her cry?,"I (32M) yelled at my gf (35F) today because she told me I didn't try hard enough to get full custody of my daughter.

So what happened was that we were talking about why she was upset last night after our therapy session. She has been having a really hard time dealing with the fallout of my daughter going to her mother's every other week. When my daughter gets back, she always has some fun new things to say, such as; ""My mommy doesn't like you"" (directed at both of us), and her new one to my gf, ""and she doesn't want me to like you either."" This newest one was following my child telling her mom that she sometimes calls my gf momma (name).

She was super upset, understandably, about this and when we were in therapy I was explaining to her why I wanted to make things work out between the three of us for my daughters sake.

I (32M) yelled at my gf (35F) today because she told me I didn't try hard enough to get full custody of my daughter.

So what happened was that we were talking about why she was upset last night after our therapy session. She has been having a really hard time dealing with the fallout of my daughter going to her mother's every other week. When my daughter gets back, she always has some fun new things to say, such as; ""My mommy doesn't like you"" (directed at both of us), and her new one to my gf, ""and she doesn't want me to like you either."" This newest one was following my child telling her mom that she sometimes calls my gf momma (name).

She was super upset, understandably, about this and when we were in therapy I was explaining to her why I wanted to make things work out between the three of us for my daughters sake.

67,1e7zokr,AITA for not cleaning my closet because I was playing shadow of the erdtree,"To preface this I had just gotten back to my house from a friends around 10:30 am. I had begun to buy and download the new Elden ring dlc when my dad can up from the downstairs immediately yelling that I needed to turn that “shit” off and clean up my closet.
 Which I’ll be honest it is the only not clean part of my side of the house, there are clothes on the floor and it looks disheveled, but it’s a walk in and I generally just don’t care about it much because when I shut the door I can’t see it anyways. 
He then continues to berate me about how I can’t do anything in life and how I’m a lazy fuck who needs to stop being “so fucking lazy.” Then he brings up how a few days ago I could not finish mowing the grass because partially I didn’t wake up early enough (then it rained so I had to stop) and it stopped working (the mower that is). He probably woke me up around 9 am to do it and I ended up starting around 12-1 pm. Again for context he wanted me to mow roughly 35ish acres of land.
 I will admit wholly that I did not finish the mowing and I could’ve started earlier I just didn’t want to, because it is summertime and he already makes me work for his trade company. So as a minor I’ve been for the whole week except for Friday working shifts for his trade company 6-10 hour long days, as a minor. Which I know, that’s what normal people do or whatever with real adult jobs but I feel like I should get a bit of a break considering this is one of my last summers.
So I mentioned that I’d already put atleast 35 hours of working in this week and he just continued cursing about how that’s normal when 90% of my friends work a max of 10 hours a week at this age. I’m currently cleaning up my closet.

68,1e7zmh8,AITA for not giving a phone I found to the 1st kid who claimed it was his? ,"This took place an hour ago.

My son (8) and I (M39) took my dog for a quick walk. We took a football with us and had a little kick around near some goal posts in a park nearby. 

We found a phone on the ground. I picked it up, it didn't unlock, so I kept it in my hand in case someone rang it. About 5 minutes later an older boy (about 10) goes running past us. My son stopped him asked him if he had lost a phone. 

""No, I haven't lost a phone. I'm looking for my dad's house keys"" he says. 

I'm thinking that's a weird coincidence, maybe the dad left his phone there as well and doesn't know it yet. 

""Well, it's a dark green case, does it look like your dad's phone?"" I ask. 

""Hmm. Dunno"" the kid replies. ""Shall I just take it anyway?""

""Best not to, I can't just give the phone to a random kid, no offence. But you live nearby? Just get him to ring it if he's lost his phone as well.""

Kid runs off. My son and I kick a ball around. About 5 minutes later I see the kid walking up with the dad. 

""Hi mate. Did you lose your phone? You able to unlock this?""

Other Dad takes the phone from me without saying a word, unlocks the phone, shows me the unlocked screen and just walks away. Not a word. 

I ask him ""Sorry mate, have I inconvenienced you? I kept your phone safe. You got it back. That's a good thing right?""

Other Dad turns and says ""well it's a bit annoying I had to come here and you didn't just give my son the phone. He was looking for my keys. It's obvious the phone also belonged to me also.""

""What? No, I'm not gonna give a phone to a random kid, no offence. He wasn't even sure it was yours.""

Other Dad doubles down and says it's common sense for me to give it to the kid. I double down and tell him it's common sense not to give a phone to a random kid. 

He walks off. I (this may be a bit AH) call after him ""the thing is bud you never once said thank you."" Guy turns, gives me a dirty look, then turns around and walks away. 

I asked my son if I was wrong for not giving the phone to the kid and my son agreed I was right. But he's 8. And my girlfriend (who is a diviner arbiter for What Is Right) is out for the evening, so I'm asking Reddit instead.

69,1e7zfh7,AITA for leaving my Grandmother I care for to go on a month-long holiday & telling my family to 'deal with it'?,"For context, I(29f) come from a big family on my Mum's(63f) side – Luca(26m), Sarah(39f), Simon(41m) and Anna(44f).

At 18, I moved across the country to study, found a job and settled there. I was the only one to move away. 18 was also the last time I had a holiday. As I was the only one who was ‘single’ when covid hit (as in, not living with my S/O), I was asked to move in with my grandparents to take care of them – I was happy to. My relationship ended due to the distance.

Sadly, their health deteriorated. They needed full-time care, which I provided - Cooking, cleaning, and personal care. After restrictions lifted, my siblings were quick to book holidays. I gave up my house, found a WFH job but my intention was always to move back to the city. After Grandpa passed, Nan asked me to stay, and I'd persistently be made fun of for 'having no life.'

I always wanted to go to the US, everyone laughed it off saying I’d never do it. I’ve been left out of family trips as 'I’ll be busy with Nan anyway’ (they leave me to watch the kids when they're away) - when I confront them, I’m called dramatic.

I’m not perfect, but I’m confident I’ve done my fair share. I’m introverted compared to my siblings, but I’ve probably made this worse for myself. Some of my siblings are more culpable than others, but all have 2-3 holidays a year.

I really needed a break after Nan was released from hospital in June. Luca and Simon refused to relieve me for a couple hours when visiting because ‘they had things to do.’ I broke down over this. I work 40 hours/week on top of unpaid caring duties – I’m tired. Nan and Mum agreed I needed a break. They told my siblings and they agreed I get a holiday. My friend invited me on a month-long trip across the US - I was stoked. As said, I’ve always wanted to go but my family were horrified. Nan cried as ‘when she said I could have a holiday, she meant a week’. Luca is annoyed as he’ll need to move in for a month to cover me.

I’m mortified. I didn’t know there were terms and conditions for my break. I gave 3 months’ notice; work didn’t have issues with this, why should they? I thought it would settle, but they won’t let it go. I snapped and told them I uprooted my life for 4 years, they can cope without me for 4 weeks, so I went ahead and booked the trip. They’re calling me selfish for booking so long, saying my situation is different – they have S/Os, kids etc. (Simon & Luca don’t have kids). But the reason I don’t is I’m here and haven’t been able to move on. They say it was MY choice to move here and do this. I’m now thinking I shouldn’t have booked so long, as even Nan is upset with me. I’m considering cancelling the trip but my friend says I’d be the AH to her if I did that. Mum won’t get involved.

70,1e7z3df,AITAH for uninviting my bio dad from my wedding?,"So, my (32F) father (54M) is a very unpredictable person. He loves you one min, and the next you're his enemy. It doesn't help that when he drinks he has a Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde personality, and is more unpredictable. He noticed that I was depressed when in uni. I survived a “bad thing” with a guy and kept it from everyone but my mom for years. He kept pushing me to tell him, even years later. So, a few years later, I thought I was ready to tell him. I kept it brief/didn’t give details. He gets emotional, we talk, and I reassure him I’m OK. He never brings it up to me again.

A year later, I was graduating and he was staying with me for the weekend. All went well until the graduation party. He is drunk and starts telling people about the bad thing (most didn’t know). I didn’t know he told anyone this until the next day when I got texts about it. He also got angry when we said he was too drunk to drive, told people he hired a “guy” to “deal” with the bad thing guy (he didn’t thank god), and other crazy things. I was exhausted by the time he left. After years of putting up with his actions, something in me snapped. I confronted him, and he denied most of it. He did own up to talking about the bad thing, saying that ""it would be a bonding experience for everyone, and it was hard for him to know this."" I told my dad I needed space, & he agreed but said that I was overreacting.

Fast forward, we start talking again, but he won't apologize/take accountability. He demands that I need to come visit him (he lives far away), and I need to make it up to him. I was anxious and told him I wasn’t ready for that yet. He blows up and says that I’m crazy and taking this too far. He keeps yelling, and I hang up. This pattern continues for years (we talk, he starts off nice, asks when I can visit, he yells, insults me, and never apologizes).

In 2022, my bf and I were planning our wedding and my dad starts wanting father-daughter dance, walking me down the aisle, speeches, etc. I am dreading this because we haven't been doing well, and the idea of having him at another special event makes me panic. After talking to my therapist, and thinking about it a lot, I decided that I wasn't comfortable having him there.

71,1e7ywq9,AITA for not being more accommodating to my partners allergies? ,"F25 and partner M24 together for almost two years. I've had my first cat for about nine years right now, and my second cat for about four. My partner and I met thru work and joked at the time that the only problem would be their cat allergy.

We have been able to afford it and had time to go multiple times during our two years. They did go to their regular general doctor and got a steroid shot twice, but we're told they could not keep receiving it so they never went again. They've never once tried to go to an allergist, looked up pricing, hours, or tried to schedule it. 

We moved to a new apartment a few months ago and despite trying to keep things clean he now deals with his allergies constantly at home again. Today he said he couldn't live like this daily and that if he does go to an allergist and it doesn't work that we'd have to live apart going forward. Ngl I'm pretty angry by this comment, but haven't said anything because I think I might be very aggressive.

72,1e7yu48,AITA for asking for time together as a family rather than every relation turning up every ,"Myself (46M) and my partner (42F) have been together for 2 years and have an 8 week old baby 

For context , the house has a rather chaotic history , her eldest son (24) has a history of drug dealing , and her youngest (15) is a great kid but often exhibits very much the same behaviours , her daughter (19) is a great kid but a standard teenager 🙄

My son (14) is severely disabled and visits us alternate Friday into Saturday and Sunday 

The issue is her eldest uses our home as childcare for his daughter every Saturday , and her mother and step father like to see the baby ever Saturday also …..so here is the problem

Her eldest often visits on a comedown and totally checks out on childcare to sleep on the sofa or chair … leaving us (mostly me ) to cook for and care for her 

Her stepfather is obnoxious in the extreme, rude and judgemental ….. and demands cakes and tea constantly while he regales us with obviously made up stories where he is the hero 

So in effect every weekend I’m caring for a disabled child while this circus goes on around me , or have to deal with it when I know I need to be up early to pick my boy up 

I spoke to my partner about this  and asked if we could please establish some boundaries on this and take time to relax at the weekend with the youngest 

True to form her reaction was that I was being over sensitive , I should accept her dad because he is old , and constantly says she will talk to the boys (but doesn’t )

Result is I spend the weekend with nowhere to sit , providing food and drinks for her dad who tells me I make the wrong choices of career , clothing , car , etc, etc 

And if a say anything at the time , I’m being over sensitive , causing a scene , etc etc 

Am I asshole here ??

The issue is her eldest uses our home as childcare for his daughter every Saturday , and her mother and step father like to see the baby ever Saturday also …..so here is the problem

Her eldest often visits on a comedown and totally checks out on childcare to sleep on the sofa or chair … leaving us (mostly me ) to cook for and care for her 

Her stepfather is obnoxious in the extreme, rude and judgemental ….. and demands cakes and tea constantly while he regales us with obviously made up stories where he is the hero 

So in effect every weekend I’m caring for a disabled child while this circus goes on around me , or have to deal with it when I know I need to be up early to pick my boy up 

I spoke to my partner about this  and asked if we could please establish some boundaries on this and take time to relax at the weekend with the youngest 

True to form her reaction was that I was being over sensitive , I should accept her dad because he is old , and constantly says she will talk to the boys (but doesn’t )

Result is I spend the weekend with nowhere to sit , providing food and drinks for her dad who tells me I make the wrong choices of career , clothing , car , etc, etc 

And if a say anything at the time , I’m being over sensitive , causing a scene , etc etc 

Am I asshole here ??

73,1e7ybfm,AITA for missing my future SIL's wedding dress shopping?,"
Forgive me if it's long, I need to get this off my chest lol 

Background - my (23F) older brother B (24M) is getting married next Autumn to his fiancée F (24F). I am one of her bridesmaids along with 3 of her friends (one of whom is the MOH). 

We have a Facebook group chat which she uses occasionally. F messaged a couple of months ago saying that she was planning on doing a first  wedding dress shop/browse in her home town (roughly an hours drive from where I live) on a specific date in July and that she'd love us all to come along with her mum and have lunch afterwards, but no pressure if we couldn't. On a visit to my house about 6 weeks ago she mentioned it again, and very casually extended the invitation to my mum and my partner to come for the lunch afterwards. She sent another message a few days ago asking who would still be able to come, giving rough timings etc and saying again not to worry if we couldn't.

I had initially said yes to coming as I felt I had to, but then realised I fucked up a week ago by getting the dates wrong and picking up a shift (I'm FOH supervisor at a restaurant) on that day. I didn't tell her this at the time as I'd managed to get it covered (or so I thought). Yesterday that cover fell through and despite trying and trying to find an alternative I was unable to, leaving me no choice but to go to work or risk losing my job (which I need as I have very very very little money right now, which everyone knows). In truth, I'd barely be able to afford the petrol to get there and back if I hadn't taken the shift, but I was willing to go if I had found cover. 

I messaged F yesterday (the day before the event) saying all this and she was very understanding and said not to worry. However my brother B has now been angrily calling my mum and complaining that I have let F down and been incredibly rude by not going. I know I got the dates wrong for my shift which was my fault, but I don't think I was wrong to prioritise my job over the dress shopping. F had multiple other people to go with, and in addition this isn't even a fitting, it's just her browsing for dresses for the first time!

75,1e7y32v,AITA for telling my cousin the comments she makes of her own body are offensive to me and to stop sending me snaps of the nature?,"My(28F) cousin (28F) had a baby in December (8 months ago) and naturally gained a healthy amount of weight that you’re SUPPOSED to gain. She has been working to lose the weight and frequently send snaps of her working out or just of her body saying “ew” or “gross” or “I’m so fat”. I ignore most of them now but used to tell her she looked great and wasn’t gross. It got old when it was an every day occurrence though. Occasionally she will send something about feeling healthy or whatever and I’ll always hype that up. 

She has lost weight. She is not fat. This has been an ongoing issue for years and she’s never gotten professional help for it. Im unsure if she is consciously aware of this, but she goes to social media for validation A that ultimately doesn’t really help because even when people say nice things she says they’re lying or reluctantly accepts the compliment with an “ugh thanks” or something. I’ve tried to gently address this but it’s never worked so for the past couple years I’ve just tried to ignore it and not feed into it. I’ve learned I won’t say anything positive that will help so honestly I just don’t engage with it anymore…

Until yesterday I received another one of these snap chats of her posed in front of a mirror (looking amazing by the way) that said “ew how could anyone look like this and show their face to the world. I am a PIG” and I lost it. I was like you do realize that you are objectively and subjectively skinnier than me and you’re saying  you don’t know how someone could show their face looking like that. Should I be ashamed of how I look and not feel comfortable showing my face to the world too? I know you don’t think highly of yourself and I’ve tried to hype you up but your comments about yourself are now indirectly talking down on others. I think you need to consider that before sending me more snaps about how you view yourself because it’s starting to get hard to not be offended by it. 

She said I was making the issue about me. Which, yeah I’m going to take offense to a comment that says people of her size (which is smaller than me) are gross because it’s indirectly saying I am also gross. If she just said she hated her body, then that is 100% a her problem and I would not make that about me and I haven’t for the years we’ve been going through this. It’s the fact she now she is saying/implying all bodies that look like hers aren’t worthy. (Which I realize is probably not what she consciously meant to say but that’s why I said what I said.

My bf fought many times with me although I’ve explained countless times. Today, he has a friend picking up stuff from him.

He went downstairs early, the phone rang and I did not pick up. My logic is that if he was at home alone, no one would pick up just like how it is for me when I am alone.

He came back mad at me coz he heard the phone ring when he was waiting for the lifts. Said that his friend could not pass security coz no one picked up the phone to give approval.

Some extra information, i am autistic and so have rather bad sensory issues especially relating to noise and temperature, so i am not able to sleep in the same bed as someone else for sure and struggle a lot sleeping in the same room as others.

79,1e7x9lz,AITA for telling my sister I am not a therapist and I cannot keep listening to her vent about the same damn thing?,"My sister Kate (40f) has been dating Chris (43m) for 2.5 years now. Chris has two sons aged 14 and 15. Kate and Chris are now engaged but ever since the engagement 7ish months ago Kate has been unloading on me about the same damn thing and at first I didn't mind her venting, I didn't even see the problem that I do now but it has become increasingly clear that this marriage will be a disaster because Kate wants something different to Chris and Chris' boys.

Chris lost his wife when his youngest was just born. Chris stayed single for over a decade and when he and Kate started dating he told her that not dating was very intentional and that he wasn't looking to replace his wife or give the boys a second parent or mom. He told her if they got more serious and she was around his sons, it would not be as a mom or mother figure and she needed to be okay with being ""dad's wife"" to his boys and not a mom. Kate said she was and at the time I really believe she was honest. But that has changed for her.

She has talked about her relationship with the boys and how she feels like a ""just dad's wife"" and how she feels like the outsider, and like the boys don't see her as a maternal presence in their lives. I mentioned a couple of times that Chris warned her of that and she said yeah, but the boys don't have any openness to an additional maternal figure. She said she feels like their grandmothers and their aunts fill that and other people's memories of their mom, but that they have shut down the idea of someone else filling it too.

Kate hates it. She has tried to get closer to them but she said they treat her like a roommate they accept but don't want to be friends with. She doesn't feel like they value her or want anything from her. It bothers her. I have heard it so many times from her. She's trying to be more than dad's wife but they don't want to know. And Chris has told her to her face that she is not their mother and it's okay. 

I can tell she's looking for more than she's being offered and the more they plan the wedding, the clear that becomes. She was upset Chris' boys didn't want to walk her down the aisle. She wanted to do some unity ceremony or whatever they're called, where they claim each other as family and to symbolize their new unit vs just the wedding ceremony but they didn't want that. She keeps venting about this to me and the more she vents, the clearer it becomes that this is not a workable situation. I have asked her if she has been honest with Chris. If she really thinks this marriage is a good idea. She keeps venting. 

Yesterday she called me at work to vent and I told her I couldn't talk. She ended up sending me a string of texts venting about the situation again. So after work I called her and I told her I am not a therapist and I cannot keep listening to her vent about the same thing. Kate freaked. She said sisters are meant to be there for each other and I suck.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-20,"AITA for telling my sister I am not a therapist and I cannot keep listening to her vent about the same damn thing? My sister Kate (40f) has been dating Chris (43m) for 2.5 years now. Chris has two sons aged 14 and 15. Kate and Chris are now engaged but ever since the engagement 7ish months ago Kate has been unloading on me about the same damn thing and at first I didn't mind her venting, I didn't even see the problem that I do now but it has become increasingly clear that this marriage will be a disaster because Kate wants something different to Chris and Chris' boys.

Chris lost his wife when his youngest was just born. Chris stayed single for over a decade and when he and Kate started dating he told her that not dating was very intentional and that he wasn't looking to replace his wife or give the boys a second parent or mom. He told her if they got more serious and she was around his sons, it would not be as a mom or mother figure and she needed to be okay with being ""dad's wife"" to his boys and not a mom. Kate said she was and at the time I really believe she was honest. But that has changed for her.

Apart from a tour of the island we just planned to spend out time relaxing by the pool in the hotel or going to the beach or looking around the local market. 

On our second night here a mother couple were sat on the table next to us at the hotel bar. My girlfriend went to the toilet and the woman in the other could was at the bar. The man from the couple next to us introduced himself and asked how the holiday was going. 

He was just making small talk and then offered to get my gf and I our next drink. I accepted the offer and thanked him then said I'd get the following round. When my gf got back he introduced himself to her and introduced his gf to us. We spent most of the evening chatting and drinking and I thought it was a nice night.

When we got back to the room my girlfriend was annoyed. She said we've wasted a night here now since we were supposed to be here to relax. I pointed out that we can still relax while being polite and talking to other people. 

She said I should have refused the offer for a drink and moved somewhere else or just apologised and said we wanted the evening to just be us. I just said that I didn't want to do that as I was enjoying chatting to the couple and that there's nothing wrong with talking to other people.

82,1e7wjzh,WIBTA for not attending to my bff's wedding?,"I apologize for any grammar & spelling mistakes, English is not my first language and I'm in a rush.

My (F24) best friend Jay (M24) gets married in October. We have been friends since we were three years old.   
  
We have stuck together until we had to change schools – we didn’t hang out much before because my mother didn’t like me hanging out with other people, but once we were in different schools I began to ask him to hang out, maybe once or twice every couple of months.  
  
It has always been me the one to start conversations and suggest hanging out, and Jay would very often ask me for a raincheck because he remembered he had something to do (he has always been extremely forgetful) but never gave me another day to reschedule. I don’t think he did it in bad faith, but I got fed up and told him that we would only hang out when he said. Ever since then we only see each other at our birthdays.  
  
Jay is extremely busy, but so am I, and we can spend a year without talking. No asking how are you, no memes, nothing. He only texts me to send me his projects, and I only texted him to see his pov on a issue I was facing. We had a severe talk about this, both promised to do better, and ever since then I made an effort to be less heavy on our dynamic, but he hasn’t changed.  
  
I feel like we are just avoiding the elephant in the room. I am trying to act like everything is fine, but I am afraid that we are not friends anymore, that we stay like this because of what we went through together and never wanting to accept that we have grown into people who don’t get along anymore, especially if only one of them pulls their weight.  
  
Jay asked me to be one of his groomsmen, but it didn’t come up until I joked about it while discussing the wedding with him and his partner. I accepted, but it feels like he is trying to appease me, as if I had butted in, and that they don’t actually want me there.   
  
He wants me to come and see his wedding suit with him, which is something he said after I made an off-handed comment of going to see his suit with him like the bride’s best friends do. He told me in May that we would be seeing the suit “in the following weeks”, so I assumed it would be during June, but a couple of days ago he told me it would be during a time in August when I am not in the city and that he should be aware of because it’s always been like that. He mentioned that I could return to the city for a few days and then go back, but when I travel it takes me a few days to adapt and it might break my vacation in half, and frankly, I don’t know if I can and I want to do this for him.  
  
I want to do the correct thing, but I don’t want this to drag anymore. I still have to pick my dress and as a “groomsmaid” I have to fit either with the bridesmaids or with the rest of groomsmen, and he hasn’t even told me what color he’d like us to be. It looks like I will have a month and a half to find a dress, a makeup artist and a hairdresser if I end up going, and I am just near my limit.

I met my friends through drum corp so I do not see them very often as we all live in different states. My plan was to travel to a spot where most corps were performing to see all of them as they are also in different corps. We all performed in the same corp last year and have branched out.

To which she got a mad because I was leaving her out. To then started a huge argument.

She thought that she was going to be involved in everything I was going to do with my friends.

I thought she was ok with me going out to see my friends without her. She said that she felt like I was just using her.

86,1e7vgbb,AITA for opening a bank account with my niece against her mother’s wishes?,"Let me open by acknowledging that my sister has mental health concerns that I admittedly struggle to comprehend. She has a few addictions, shopping among them, that make any sort of financial management a nightmare and our family is constantly digging her out of holes to the point that it has drained our father’s retirement. That being said…

My niece Hazel (17f) asked me for help to open a bank account. I asked why not go to her mother and she explained that she’s been asking for over a year and it just hasn’t happened because she always brushes it off.

I approached my sister, her mom, about it, asking if she minded if I stepped in to help, and I got a very harsh “it’s my kid and my business! Stay out of it!”

Hazel eventually explained that the main reason she wants an account is to access all the birthday/christmas money she had been handing over to her mother for years to “invest”.

I am 99% certain, considering my sister’s hesitation and history, that that money no longer exists. And it breaks my heart for my niece.

But it’s still only a theory. 

My niece kept begging me. Eventually, I gave in and escorted her to the bank to put her in touch with a teller to independently open an account. I stayed as uninvolved as possible, but answered questions on the basics of real investing and suggested opening an RESP (registered education savings) with whatever money she has because it comes with free matching grants for higher education.

My sister is furious. She still refuses to admit those birthday/christmas funds are gone, but the account has triggered Hazel asking for the money constantly as she’d need to open an RESP account before she turns 18. 

I acknowledge that I triggered this potentially relationship-breaking argument between them by helping. But Hazel is nearly an adult, had been requesting help for months if not years (she had no idea she could open one herself) and needs that account to live her life even if she has to start from scratch. I’m torn as to whether I crossed a line.

87,1e7vb0c,AITA for refusing to cut down on screen time while caring for my nephew? ,"Sorry for My english.

My sister, Alex, had an unplanned pregnancy with her dead boyfriend when she was 18 and since he was 6 months old she has been a ""single mother"" to my nephew, Marc (2.5M) 

Alex currently lives with my parents, just like me and is attending college at night, while working in the afternoon and taking care of Marc in the morning. So during the afternoon and evening Marc needs someone to stay with him. My parents stay with him at night, since they work morning/afternoon and Marc stays with me in the afternoon. 

I don't mind taking care of him, but I'm in  pre exams to college, so I spend all my time studying and, because of that, I put a cartoon on TV while Marc is with me until his schedule arrives. sleeping 2h later on the mattress that I leave in my room. This is our routine and it doesn't usually require so work. 

My sister has recently been complaining that Marc seems to be addicted to screens and was worried about this possible addiction and the harm to him. This has become a constant complaint and, yesterday, she came to talk to me and my parents about the need to try to reduce his screen time, especially me, and she would try to find ways for us to do this, proposing other activities, etc. 

I said that I can't propose other activities without getting in the way of my studies because they require time and attention, something I don't have a problem with when he's distracted by the TV, a few times a day he needs attention (especially close to his bedtime) . But they were welcome to apply this when caring for him.

 She replied saying that I could try to reduce it for his sake just as our parents are willing to try. 

I said that at this point, with 3 months close to college exams, it wasn't possible and if she wants me to take care of him while she can't, that's my way. After that time, I can try, not now. 

Our conversation didn't work out, she says I'm being too irreducible and I could at least try, since everyone is doing it. But I saw my parents' attempt today to reduce screen time and it seems so exhausting and time-consuming, requiring attention and conversation, I really don't have that much energy and time.

AITA?

Extra: I babysit for free ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-20,"AITA for refusing to cut down on screen time while caring for my nephew?  Sorry for My english.

My sister, Alex, had an unplanned pregnancy with her dead boyfriend when she was 18 and since he was 6 months old she has been a ""single mother"" to my nephew, Marc (2.5M) 

Alex currently lives with my parents, just like me and is attending college at night, while working in the afternoon and taking care of Marc in the morning. So during the afternoon and evening Marc needs someone to stay with him. My parents stay with him at night, since they work morning/afternoon and Marc stays with me in the afternoon. 

I don't mind taking care of him, but I'm in  pre exams to college, so I spend all my time studying and, because of that, I put a cartoon on TV while Marc is with me until his schedule arrives. sleeping 2h later on the mattress that I leave in my room. This is our routine and it doesn't usually require so work. 

My sister has recently been complaining that Marc seems to be addicted to screens and was worried about this possible addiction and the harm to him. This has become a constant complaint and, yesterday, she came to talk to me and my parents about the need to try to reduce his screen time, especially me, and she would try to find ways for us to do this, proposing other activities, etc.

90,1e7ugq7,AITA for calling out my best friend in the groupchat for lying?,"This may be a long one. Me (18F) and my best friend (17F) have known each other since we were around 12 years old..
That being said, l've always had a suspicion that she's actually a pathological liar. When we were younger i used to suspect her of lying constantly but she was proven to be telling the truth in one or two scenarios which made me believe that she was actually always telling the truth and my intuition was actually just always off or wrong.
But in the last year her lies have become more egregious and my other friends have begun to notice it too.
The issue is that it's extremely difficult to prove that what she's saying is actually a lie. For instance, both of us have music on spotify and i started releasing music about a year before she did. This was mostly just for friends and family to listen to my music.
However, the other day she told me that she heard one of her songs being played in a few stores while we were shopping. But she only had around 40 monthly listeners so i automatically didn't believe her as it sounded unlikely. however, the issue is that she very well could have heard her song playing in the store - I have no way to prove that she didn’t. 

She also tells our friends behind my back that she's getting the best grades in music in the entire year level, which is  false. She has only beaten me in one piece of assessment over the 5 years we've been in music together and it's always been me or one other boy who has won the music award at the year..
In the groupchat we were having a conversation about how our music class in grade eight was absolutely terrible. I commented that I was the only person who got A's in that class for a couple years running, but she denied it saying that ""You and I were always at the top,"" and ""I've never gotten anything below an A."" These statements are both false.
I got quite frustrated because at this point I had gotten sick of her lying and said that I remember the grades we both got but she got angry and called me a liar, saying ""This is your ego talking.""
I lost my mind at this point and scrolled through my emails and found my old report cards which proved that in year eight, I had been the only person to receive an A. She said that she wasn't in music that year which is why it shows that only one person got an A (which is a downright lie, I have never been in a music class without her) but then I showed her the screenshots of our grade 9 report card showing once again that I was the only person who got an A.

She then messaged me privately and was angry that I had taken a small matter so far, and that | ""always needed to be right"" but me and my friends have let her lies go on for so long and we're all sick of it. A couple other friends messaged me privately and thanked me for calling her out.
I do acknowledge that the detail was insignificant but I am quite sick of her acting like she's better than me when she's not.
So, am I the asshole?

91,1e7u544,AITAH For wanting to keep my daughter away from her dad?,"My (37f) and my daughter's dad (38m) were together for about 17 years, but never married. During that time, he cheated on me constantly and kept himself on dating  apps posing as a single man. We lived together 16 of the 17 years we were together and never took a break or broke up, but still, he would tell everyone he was single. Throughout the 17 years we were together, so many things happened that directly affected my self esteem and self worth. Whenever I wasn't working, I would be called all types of names and told I would never be able to take care of myself. I stopped being intimate with him for almost 2 years before I officially left because he was messing around with so many other people, I became worried for my health. Even with all of these things happening, he was still a good father. His family has always disliked me simply because they preferred the woman he was with before we got together and they remained good friends with her throughout our relationship often bringing up her name to him while I was sitting right there. It got to the point where I decided I didn't want to be around his family anymore and if he would go there, I would just sit in the car until he was ready to go because I didn't want to hear how well his ex was doing all the time. I lost my mom in 2020 and went through serious depression for several months after that since my mom was pretty much my best friend and the only person I could talk to. I told him I was depressed while crying and he laughed at me. He often couldn't hold a job for longer than 5 or 6 months and would be a complete angel anytime he knew he needed me to pay bills (even though he swore I couldn't take care of myself) so we wouldn't be evicted. We were actually evicted from several different places because we went half on all of the bills and I would often have my half of the bill except for the times I wasn't working which wasn't often at all. I work from home and the last straw was when I asked him to make our daughter some food since he was off that day and wasn't doing anything. He completely went off on me and called me a stupid bitch and several other hurtful things. I strongly believe this reaction was him being mad at one of his many side pieces and taking it out on me. After that happened, I ended taking my daughter and moving to a completely different city 3 hours away. A month later he moved to the same city and now lives 5 minutes away from us. I helped him with so much stuff since he has been down here including his rent to the point he owed me almost $1000 dollars but I told him to just pay $700 of it back which he was attempting to do at first and now doesn't even try to pay me anything. We agreed that I would use his car to get our daughter back and forth to school since my car is 2 door and doesn't open from the inside on the passenger side, and he would use my car to drive to work. We agreed that I would make repairs to his car and he would make repairs to mine if any damage occurred while we were driving. Fast forward to the control arm going out in my car and making a terrible noise, but instead of him fixing it like he promised, he brought it to me and took his car knowing that was my only source of transportation to get me and my daughter around especially now since it's back to school time and I have no way of shopping to get her things. When he first moved here he made it a point to see our daughter at least 3 times a week, but then he said that he could only have her every other weekend now which was fine. However, he has missed his visits almost 4 times in a row despite living literally 4 or 5 minutes down the street. Over the past 2 months, he has probably seen her a total of 4 times and yesterday when he came to pick her up, he suddenly said he would need to bring her back tonight because he had plans with someone. I asked him specifically not to make plans on the days he has our daughter but he continuously does it anyway. This has happened several times. One weekend he just didn't show up at all only to find out that he preferred to spend the weekend with someone he just met on Facebook rather sticking to his agreement to pick up my daughter. I told him after today that he doesn't need to come and get her anymore until he can do what he says he is going to do. I buy everything for my daughter and he barely pitches in. He took himself shopping at the mall and got my daughter a tshirt knowing she needs more clothes. I thought about all of these things and went off on him so bad and told him that he wouldn't see our child again after this last situation. That means he would only have her for 1 day after not seeing her for almost a month. My daughter is at the age where she is noticing that he's barely around even though he lives so close.

96,1e7rz0h,AITA for holding my boyfriend’s actions over his head during our last weekend in Korea? ,"

My bf K and I have been in Seoul for two months. K loves to party, so we've been going out a lot in large groups due to his many friends here. I've told him that I feel we're not spending enough time together, just the 2 of us, and that it seems like he's always putting me last. He stays out all night and go on benders with his friends, barely responding to my texts, and gets upset when I say it makes me feel bad.

In his field of work, connections with celebrities can lead to big opportunities. A friend of a friend of mine W came to town recently with a major celebrity. I've been trying to arrange for W to come out with us so that K could connect with the celeb. Last night we succeeded and W joined us. We planned to do a bar crawl through themed bars, but after a few stops, the group wanted to go to a nightclub. I had no energy for a nightclub, and since K and his friends had already made friends with W, I told K I was heading home to pack. I suggested he go to the club to lock in plans with the celebrity's team for the next night.

K initially said he'd come home with me, but given our efforts to make this connection, I insisted he go to the club. He was worried I'd fall asleep since it was already 2 AM and made me promise to stay up so we could watch anime together and spend some time just us. He stressed how important this was to him.

By 2:30 AM, his phone died. By 3, I heard from W that everyone had split up upon arriving at the club, and he couldn't find K, so he left. I texted a friend, who confirmed K's phone had died and said he'd pass on my message, but I never heard back. K's phone stayed dead until 5:30. When he finally responded, he was at a gaming cafe with ppl. He said he was too drunk to remember our talk and only apologized after I requested it. I asked him to come home and rest so we could have a full day together, but he had taken a stimulant and planned not to sleep, despite knowing he’s hard to be around when he's exhausted from hanging out with others.

I went to bed and slept until 2 PM. When I woke up, he still wasn't home. He sporadically responded to my texts and didn’t come home until 5. With only two days left in Asia, I reminded him of his promise to prioritize our time together. When he arrived, I tried to express my feelings, but he dismissed them, saying I was overreacting. He claimed he hadn’t wanted to go out and only did so because I insisted. While I did encourage him to go to make the connection, he abandoned it and stayed out for another 15 hours. I feel gaslit, as anyone would feel neglected and unimportant if treated this way. Yet, he says I’m ruining our last days in Seoul by bringing up my feelings, even though he only apologized after being asked and not for staying out extra hours.

He is very wealthy and often pays for things and buys gifts, which seems to make him think he deserves more slack. I’m left wondering if I’m overreacting or taking things too personally. Am I making a big deal out of nothing?

97,1e7rw7i,AITA for not asking my grandparents to share money between me and my step and half siblings?,"My grandparents (both sides) were close friends for years before I was born. Their kids getting married brought them together and they were close. When I (17M) was born my two sets of grandparents decided to come together and save money for me to go to college or buy a house one day in the future. They continued even when things with my mom got complicated and my parents separated, and again when my mom died they continued. When my maternal grandparents passed away within a year of each other my paternal grandparents kept saving money and honoring what the four of them had started.

My dad remarried not long after my mom died, but they were separated for a long time before that, but never legally divorced. It's complicated. My dad became a stepdad when he remarried. His stepkids are 16, 13 and 11. My dad and his wife Marie had two kids together as well. They're 8 and 7 now.

I'm not close to my dad or his family, my stepfamily. I do live with them, for obvious reasons, but I wouldn't lie and say I love them or we're all a happy family. There's shit mostly to do with my mom and my mom's two siblings that are a source of tension and I just never spend time with the kids.

My grandparents told me about the money recently. They weren't subtle enough about saying they needed to talk to me and dad remembered the money they saved. He asked and we all denied what it was about but he pressed the issue and told Marie about it. She claimed it was clear that my grandparents had informed me that the money was being divided between the six of us evenly now. My grandpa said no. He also said this was none of her business. So they argued. Grandma took me aside so I wasn't caught in the argument but my dad and Marie did bring me into it later. They told me anything I get from my grandparents I must share. I told them my maternal grandparents were a part of saving and none of the others were anything to them so it made no sense to do that. They told me it made sense when all six of us are siblings and my paternal grandparents are related to all of us and they contributed to it. I told them I don't have the money anyway. Marie told me to ask my grandparents to share it, because they can control it and they have a say as the savers. She told me it's what you do for family and what I should do to be a good brother, I had rejected any kind of brotherly role before this and now is my time to come through and show I care even a little about my siblings and their futures.

I didn't ask. Marie and my dad have brought it up several times since. When dad and Marie realized I wasn't going to, they told me I can leave their house on my 18th birthday and live with either my grandparents or one of my mom's siblings since I'm so attached to blood and care nothing for chosen family. They also told me I can explain to the others that I won't help them. I said no, that I wouldn't explain shit and they can hate me if they want because I don't care.

99,1e7rey8,AITA for having a birthday party behind my parents back?,"I (16m) turned 16 a month ago. I told my parents I didn't want to celebrate but the truth was my best friend Shane's (16m) parents were throwing me a birthday party instead. They took me and a few of my friends to play paintball as my party and then we went out for pizza afterward. It was treated like a party because they got me a cake and everything. It was so much fun. Best birthday I remember having. The reason I didn't tell my parents is because they always make my birthdays about my siblings and me, not just me. I always have to do age friendly stuff. I have to let them open presents with me. I'm supposed to let them blow out my candles. Last year they rented a bounce house and told me and my friends we had to let the little kids play and we got stuck with nothing to do but sit around and talk. The two years before we just had at home parties but my siblings blew out my candles and opened all my presents. The one before everything went to hell my parents rented out a soft play area. I was too old for it and so were my friends so we sat with the adults while my siblings played.

This is not the only place my parents make me think of my siblings first. If I get invited to parties they come whether they're invited or not. And my parents will refuse to let me attend when parents refuse to let my siblings join. They'll make me take some of my siblings if I go to the mall or out to eat with friends. If my friends and I want to watch a movie, I normally end up with my two closest in age siblings tagging along. We then have to watch something suitable for them and sometimes I have been grounded for watching something they didn't want to see.

I also have to give up time with my friends to babysit siblings spending time with their friends

I talked to my parents about my problem with all this before and they did not listen and did not care. Without saying shut up I was told to shut up. My siblings don't see a problem with it, but their lives aren't disrupted like mine and they like hanging out with me. But I resent them for it and I know they're not the reason but yeah, I resent my siblings, I hate spending *any* time with them now and it feels like a chore even when it's not supposed to.

So my 10 year old brother has problems with the 10 year old brother of one of my friends. They're jerks to each other and my brother is always making fun of the other kid that he (my brother) gets to hang out with older kids when the other kid doesn't. They're going to the same day camp this year and the other kid and my brother were fighting and the other kid told my brother about my party. He told my parents. There were tears and yelling and complaining and whining and my parents told me I had been a selfish brat for cutting my siblings from my own birthday celebration and going behind their back. They grounded me and I'm only partially off it now but the punishment is still ongoing and my parents said my behavior was some of the worst they had ever seen.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-20,"AITA for having a birthday party behind my parents back? I (16m) turned 16 a month ago. I told my parents I didn't want to celebrate but the truth was my best friend Shane's (16m) parents were throwing me a birthday party instead. They took me and a few of my friends to play paintball as my party and then we went out for pizza afterward. It was treated like a party because they got me a cake and everything. It was so much fun. Best birthday I remember having. The reason I didn't tell my parents is because they always make my birthdays about my siblings and me, not just me. I always have to do age friendly stuff. I have to let them open presents with me. I'm supposed to let them blow out my candles. Last year they rented a bounce house and told me and my friends we had to let the little kids play and we got stuck with nothing to do but sit around and talk. The two years before we just had at home parties but my siblings blew out my candles and opened all my presents. The one before everything went to hell my parents rented out a soft play area. I was too old for it and so were my friends so we sat with the adults while my siblings played.

This is not the only place my parents make me think of my siblings first. If I get invited to parties they come whether they're invited or not. And my parents will refuse to let me attend when parents refuse to let my siblings join. They'll make me take some of my siblings if I go to the mall or out to eat with friends. If my friends and I want to watch a movie, I normally end up with my two closest in age siblings tagging along. We then have to watch something suitable for them and sometimes I have been grounded for watching something they didn't want to see.

I also have to give up time with my friends to babysit siblings spending time with their friends

I talked to my parents about my problem with all this before and they did not listen and did not care. Without saying shut up I was told to shut up. My siblings don't see a problem with it, but their lives aren't disrupted like mine and they like hanging out with me. But I resent them for it and I know they're not the reason but yeah, I resent my siblings, I hate spending *any* time with them now and it feels like a chore even when it's not supposed to.

So my 10 year old brother has problems with the 10 year old brother of one of my friends. They're jerks to each other and my brother is always making fun of the other kid that he (my brother) gets to hang out with older kids when the other kid doesn't. They're going to the same day camp this year and the other kid and my brother were fighting and the other kid told my brother about my party. He told my parents. There were tears and yelling and complaining and whining and my parents told me I had been a selfish brat for cutting my siblings from my own birthday celebration and going behind their back.

100,1e7qhs1,AITA for not inviting someone to my party because of another guest?,"So there is a lot to unpack, and it’s a little complicated but please bear with me. For some background, I used to work at a large international resort, that’s how I met the other people in this story. I used to work with my boyfriend “Jay” , my friend “Tyson” and other friend “Peter” now we were all coworkers and friends at one point, we didn’t all have the same shift but when everyone did get together it was a good time. Now my boyfriend Jay, moved departments of where he was working, but still in the same building. Eventually Tyson also moved to the same department as Jay so they were once again coworkers, while Peter and I continued to be coworkers. Tyson and I still kept our friendship even though I saw him less than usual, whereas I saw Peter pretty much every day. That being said Tyson and Peter were still friends too until they weren’t… this is where it gets a little tricky and I don’t know EXACTLY what happened or all of the events leading up to it, but Peter’s then boyfriend slept with Tyson (who also had a partner) so there was a lot of cheating going on. Peter and his boyfriend broke up, and Tyson and Peter’s ex started dating and they are still together. As I mentioned before I don’t know how it all happened and no one involved ever told me, but there were rumours  and then clues that I could piece together. Little instances, like Peter and Tyson never looked at each other or spoke when they were in the same room or right next to each other, Tyson’s ex partner also ignored him and soon quit the job. I still remained friendly with both Tyson and Peter, I didn’t pick sides and no one asked me too. Eventually I left the company but would come back to visit Jay, I haven’t seen much of Peter at all during my visits and haven’t spoken to him. I’ve seen Tyson and have hung out with him in a group settings with Jay and others of his coworkers.

On to the part where I may be the Ahole, I am having a birthday soon. Jay has arranged for a little birthday bbq for me and has invited his coworkers which includes Tyson, I really like all of his coworkers and get a long with them so I’m happy Jay invited them , and I don’t have a lot of friends there anymore anyway, since I lost contact when I moved away.  Of course I’m still able to invite other people. Here is where I may be the Ahole, As much as I will always care for Peter I don’t think it’s a good idea to invite him, since Tyson will be there. Peter and I still follow each other on instagram and can see each others stories and posts. I’m not sure if he will be hurt that I didn’t invite him or that he will see Ive been hanging out with Tyson and be hurt. I’m not even sure if there will be many pictures taken or anything at all.

101,1e7qc0v,AITA for breaking my lease on my apartment,"This is something that I've been wrestling with for a bit so I'd like to see what others might have to say.

I moved into a new city 3 years ago and got an apartment with my bestfriend, we split rent and all other things. 

Fast forward to this year, at the beginning of January I moved out of the apartment we shared to live with my then fiancee (now husband). 

Instead of signing another year long lease, I had opted for a month to month situation. However, my roommate had had such a horrific panic attack about us getting kicked out that we signed a year lease.

I agreed that when I moved in with my fiancee that I would continue to pay my half of rent even though I would no longer be living there. This in part was because I didn't want to break our lease and have it count against me, and they mentioned how they were unsure if they could do it alone.

Our lease officially ends this November, and after everything is said and done I will have paid rent for an apartment I did not live in for almost an entire year.

The problem we are running into is that I recently lost my job, and have been using what meager savings I had to keep things going. I've reached the end of my emergency funds and have had to suck it up and ask my parents for help.

Because of this I was unable to pay my half of rent this month. Something I communicated with them and tried to keep them in the loop of what things would look financially. They paid both our half's of rent and said I would owe them. 

They have been hounding me every day about when I will be able to pay them back. My parents gave me a hundred dollars to help with gas and basic groceries and they threw a big stink about how they needed gas more then me as they were working and I wasn't. I sucked it up and got some basics from the store and gave them the rest.

This has been a consistent theme anytime I have had to ""owe"" them for something. They will be constantly at my ear asking when they will get things back, which is such a big shift from how our friendship has been.

They've started to use past times they've paid for a shared bill and I paid them back as examples of how immature I am financially and have begun to hold them over my head. It's a constant stream of how much I owe them because of XYZ over the years and how they've kept everything going and I need to be more responsible and help more and I can't just expect them to be okay without me helping them etc etc.

Because of this I've been wondering if I should break our lease early and remove them from my phone plan to lessen the financial strain on myself.

I currently pay for their phone bill, which I've never once pressured them to pay me for it, as I paid it for well over 2 years before they even tried to pay for a portion of it.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-20,"AITA for breaking my lease on my apartment This is something that I've been wrestling with for a bit so I'd like to see what others might have to say.

On New Years I was staying at hers and we jumped in the pool in our clothes. I accidentally left my shirt there and she had gone on holidays for 3 weeks afterwards. 

I figured I could easily get my shirt when she got back. However when we next hung out I asked her if she had my shirt and she said ‘Ohh, I have a rule if someone leaves something at my house for more than a month it’s mine.’ I was a bit confused but I ignored it. 

Fast forward to last month and she had stayed at mine while her and her boyfriend were in an argument. She had left her portable charger, hoodie and eyelash curler. I kept trying to organise to give it back to her but she just made up excuses. My apartment is TINY and barely has enough room for my own clothes and stuff so it was a bit of an inconvenience especially because I am a neat freak. She blew me off a lot until she messaged me at 1am last night saying ‘Drop my stuff off now.’

I found it really weird and a little rude that she messaged me at 1am in the fkn morning and just expected me to drop it off when I had offered multiple times for her to grab it or for me to drop it off. I ignored her until the morning and I had 3 more messages from her just saying things like how it’s disappointing I’ve been friends with her for so long but I’m not there for her and something bad could of happened, etc. I replied saying ‘Sorry if someone leaves something at my house for more than a month it’s mine, you know how it is.’ She got absolutely pissed and I feel like it was immature of me but I couldn’t help but be a bit annoyed.

104,1e7pswa,WIBTA if I talked to my dad about how my mom is around my sister (and used to be me as well)?,"I moved out of my parent’s house a couple of months ago now and I’ve been looking back on how I’ve grown up in their house. My mom always seemed comfortable being naked around us. I don’t know if it should have bothered me, but I guess I never put too much thought into it.

While I was still in school, my parents would try to make my sister and I go to bed at about 10-10:30 on school nights so we had enough sleep. Often times we would stay up to midnight and that’d be when my mom takes her showers. She would tell us to get to bed before she would get in the shower. I always felt like it was a dumb rule and would stay up as late as I felt like, and so would my sister. Well, my mom would threaten to rub her whole body on us, unclothed, if we didn’t go to bed. My sister can’t control her reactions and emotions too well (not shaming at all, I get how it feels, I’ve been there), so she goes “NOOOO EWWWW” every time. She would get it wayyy more than I would and it may be because I didn’t react. maybe reacting is what would fuel my mom to do it more, I’m not 100% certain.

After graduating, it really amped up on how much she’d do it to my sister. I worked evenings and sometimes overnights so they didn’t care if I stayed up. I would see my mom quite literally chase my sister around the house to rub herself on her to get her to go to bed. I think it’s weird now after discussing this with friends and my bf, but this is where I get to my question.

105,1e7prje,AITA for wanting a safe space for my 7 month old,"Some backstory: when I got pregnant my aunt offered for us to live in her cabin separate from her house, against my better judgement I agreed to stay closer to home and move in with Adalaide, my husband (James) mother. I did this for the sake of James' job and because his mother offered. I did not ask to live there and it took some convincing to get me to agree to it. While I was recovering from a C-section in the hospital Adalaide texted that she did not ask for another dog to be living with us, (my dog Rain, that was my only condition to agree to move in and she said yes). After a couple weeks home we went out to get baby supplies and had forgotten to feed the dogs. To which we received a text directed at Rain saying that maybe she should go elsewhere if we couldn't provide for her. There are three dogs for context. A dog her daughter (Cynthia) convinced her to get and left behind. James' dog and my dog Rain. So I told Adalaide I would take care of my dog from then on and I did. From then on it's been a disaster. From Adalaide asking me to not do tummy time when she's home because my baby (Andy) cried during it, to Adalaide getting defensive and telling me I should find somewhere else to live because I asked her to keep her distance from Andy when she was home, sick from work. I have been in therapy since my son was born due to Postpartum Anxiety and Depression, I have since learned that I suffer from obsessive compulsive disordered thoughts, consisting of anxiety with germs. I ask everyone if they washed their hands and in my family I make sure they are not wearing clothes they have smoked in. I confessed to Adalaide that I was suffering with OCD early on after finding out. After the argument of being told to find somewhere else to live Adalaide recommended group therapy. Reluctantly, as a overwhelmed first time mom, I agreed. We never had a session but Adalaide brought home a ""Fighting Fair"" list of rules from her therapist and her therapist recommended we all write down five things that are the most important to us as well. Throughout these last 7 months Adalaide offers to watch Andy while I shower or nap. Every time she asked if I needed help I declined. James and I explained we both want to feel like we can parent on our own.  I allowed Adalaide to be alone in a nearby room with Andy once and the anxiety was too much. To this day she is the only person who has been alone with Andy, aside from James and I. Adalaide was distraught after her offers of help were continuously declined. She claimed her love language was ""acts of service"" and that that is how she shows affection.

Today I came home to a teething wafer that was previously on the floor, now was on Andys highchair. I confronted Adalaide and asked that I be in charge of maintaining the living areas where we spend our time. AITA for overreacting to something so small?

EDIT: I wasn't aware that images are not allowed. I really feel the screenshots speak for themselves. When I asked Adalaide about the dirty food she responded that she is ""unaware of some of her actions like picking something up and placing it where it doesn't belong"" to which I told her that gave me more incentive to not want to leave Andy alone in her care. I also think it's important to share that Adalaide is retiring soon and planning to move to another state, the plan being that James and I will take over the home here and Adalaide will have a place to stay when she visits. I think the perspective becomes clearer if I note that this is my third time attempting to live with Adalaide and I was subsequently kicked out twice after addressing problems with cleanliness in the home. When I ask for compromises I am met with hostility or my concerns are ignored. Adalaide has voiced that she thinks communicating is important, so I have worked on my communication skills. Whatever she asks of me I work with her and adapt to her wishes. There has not been one instance of her doing the same for me.

A dog her daughter (Cynthia) convinced her to get and left behind. James' dog and my dog Rain. So I told Adalaide I would take care of my dog from then on and I did. From then on it's been a disaster. From Adalaide asking me to not do tummy time when she's home because my baby (Andy) cried during it, to Adalaide getting defensive and telling me I should find somewhere else to live because I asked her to keep her distance from Andy when she was home, sick from work. I have been in therapy since my son was born due to Postpartum Anxiety and Depression, I have since learned that I suffer from obsessive compulsive disordered thoughts, consisting of anxiety with germs. I ask everyone if they washed their hands and in my family I make sure they are not wearing clothes they have smoked in. I confessed to Adalaide that I was suffering with OCD early on after finding out. After the argument of being told to find somewhere else to live Adalaide recommended group therapy. Reluctantly, as a overwhelmed first time mom, I agreed. We never had a session but Adalaide brought home a ""Fighting Fair"" list of rules from her therapist and her therapist recommended we all write down five things that are the most important to us as well. Throughout these last 7 months Adalaide offers to watch Andy while I shower or nap. Every time she asked if I needed help I declined. James and I explained we both want to feel like we can parent on our own.  I allowed Adalaide to be alone in a nearby room with Andy once and the anxiety was too much. To this day she is the only person who has been alone with Andy, aside from James and I. Adalaide was distraught after her offers of help were continuously declined. She claimed her love language was ""acts of service"" and that that is how she shows affection.

Today I came home to a teething wafer that was previously on the floor, now was on Andys highchair. I confronted Adalaide and asked that I be in charge of maintaining the living areas where we spend our time. AITA for overreacting to something so small?

EDIT: I wasn't aware that images are not allowed. I really feel the screenshots speak for themselves. When I asked Adalaide about the dirty food she responded that she is ""unaware of some of her actions like picking something up and placing it where it doesn't belong"" to which I told her that gave me more incentive to not want to leave Andy alone in her care. I also think it's important to share that Adalaide is retiring soon and planning to move to another state, the plan being that James and I will take over the home here and Adalaide will have a place to stay when she visits. I think the perspective becomes clearer if I note that this is my third time attempting to live with Adalaide and I was subsequently kicked out twice after addressing problems with cleanliness in the home. When I ask for compromises I am met with hostility or my concerns are ignored. Adalaide has voiced that she thinks communicating is important, so I have worked on my communication skills. Whatever she asks of me I work with her and adapt to her wishes. There has not been one instance of her doing the same for me. ",1.0,1.0380178689956665,1,1
106,1e7pqn4,WIBTA to dump one of my longest friends for no apparent reason?,"I (15M) have been friends with K (14F) since I was 10 years old. Since then, we’ve gotten into three huge fights and several small ones but have always managed to repair our friendship. We had been stuck in the same class of 15 for eight years, and it was obvious to me that because of our limited network, both of us never found our “person” and resorted to each other. I really wanted to be her best friend, but when someone asked if we were, she said “we don’t do that.”

Fast forward to our first year of high school (last year). K found a best friend really quickly. She posts TikToks of the two of them, they go out all the time, they call every day, etc. Half of me was happy for her and the other half was a bit jealous, not of losing K, but that she found someone (so quickly).

So what’s my problem? K speaks very well of her best friend and treats her with respect. However, she doesn’t greet me. She did not once congratulate me after seeing me perform (on four separate occasions). She only put me on her summer bucket list because I have a pool. She thinks I’m a klutz and “book smart”and that she’s “street smart”. She’s reluctant and careless to make plans with me. At least that’s how it feels.

You might think I’m a pushover but I’m not. I’m queer, so there’s less friend options at school. She is kind of all I have. And I like hanging out with her in the moment, it’s just when I re-realize the love she has for her best friend (and other people she respects). And I get excited when she asks me to hang out because I don’t do that a lot. And we have mostly mutual friends so I would lose some good ones.

I’m at a point right now where I’m just done. I can’t think about this anymore. I may have exaggerated but I honestly don’t care because this is how it feels. But there’s no real reason and nothing has changed. Are these reasons reasonable? WIBTA? And how should I go about it if / if not?

107,1e7pbd3,AITA for refusing to pay and leaving my friends in a restaurant as the ‘rich friend’?,"| (20f) have an amazing group of friends (7 people) from university. We met in our second year and have been super close ever since. For context, we go to a relatively expensive college with no scholarship so it’s safe to assume all of us are somewhat well off. When we were first getting to know each other we often went out for brunch and drinks and split the bill most of the time. However, I’ve been brought up to never let others pay and would offer to cover the bill whenever I could. No one else offered to cover but I believe it’s just not common where they’re from.

A few months ago we were talking about our parents’ occupations and I told them about my family. A quick google search of my name brings up my father’s page however they had never connected the dots regarding our relation. My father is well known in the real estate industry and makes quite a bit of money. Since then, I’ve been labelled as the ‘rich friend’ in our group.

Whenever we go shopping, I’m expected to buy expensive items for myself and uber everywhere instead of using public transport. When I do shop cheaper it becomes a spectacle. I also feel guilty whenever I pull out only my portion in cash since I can tell it makes everyone else uncomfortable to then dig through their bags for their share. Therefore I often just end up covering anyways. 

 A few weeks ago, it was one of my friends’ 21st birthday and I told him I would pay for any activity as a birthday gift. We went out and had a nice dinner as a group. I didn’t mind since I offered. What bothered me was when I turned 20 recently and was hoping my friends would take care of me for one day. I usually never have this expectation, but was really let down since I always seem to be the one treating everyone else even on my special day. 

My last straw was when we went on vacation recently to my home country. They, as usual, made plans for a pub crawl night. I initially didn’t intend on going since I had scheduled dinner with my parents later that night. I eventually caved and ended up going for only a few hours. During that time I had maybe one drink but hadn’t eaten all night. I decided to call it a night after 2 hours to go have dinner with my family. Before I was leaving, however, one of my friends asked if I could quickly cover the tab before I left. I would’ve usually agreed, but this circumstance felt different since I hadn’t eaten and barely drank. I also didn’t want to come in the first place. This time, it seemed like they were trying to use me to pay even if it was unintentional. I simply said I would, but left without paying. I got a text later from one of them saying “i thought you said you paid lol. how was dinner?” 

We brushed over that instance quite easily but their behaviour from that night still bothers me. It seems like I have become the ‘rich friend’ character that always pays for their friends. How do I fix this without seeming like an AH?

EDIT: thank you so much for the advice guys! as of now, the best option seems to be to blame it on a third party even if that may not be so kind to my dad haha. I might bring up that I have an allowance so I can start cutting back on expenses. 

To clarify a few details, 

—> I have been brought up to pay for others when they also do the same. It is always a nice gesture that has gone both ways. The reason I am starting to resent it is because it now seems one sided.

—> More than the money, what bothers me is the realisation that my group of friends may never treat me and I am always the one to splurge on them. It seems inherently one sided. 

—> When I mentioned purchasing expensive items, I meant for myself. It has become almost a brand/identity that I have no intention of continuing. Whenever I don’t spend much money, they pass comments like “oh miss private jet is using public transport!” or when I repeat outfits “don’t you have enough money to have a new outfit every day”. There were never remarks like this earlier. I’m sure they mean it as a joke but these comments just get to me sometimes since even normal activities I do are put under the spotlight now. It also adds to this archetype I am trying to separate myself from.

—> My behaviour has never changed upon being given the label. I get that it can easily become a self fulfilling prophecy but I have made sure to stay the same. Rather it seems that my actions now are fitted to the title and attributed to it. 

—> The conversation regarding our backgrounds was bound to come up as we were getting to know each other. It was inevitable and I couldn’t hide it Being secretive would imply it is a big deal when it’s not. I gave brief details however they ran with it. 

—> Lastly, I also realise I may have written this post quite strongly. I am unsure as to whether their behaviour is intentional or they seriously have no idea.

112,1e7os54,AITA for not letting my in-laws come on my family camping trip?,"Preface this with I love my In laws, they’re great and so kind towards me. 

So my story goes: 

I have an annual camping trip with my family where we go camping for a week every year. My parents got married there, have their anniversary, my cousins and aunts/ uncles go, old friends, yadda yadda. 

Since I’ve been with my hubby, my in laws come up for a day during the 3-4 days we are there. They spend the whole day, have dinner with us then go home, they are about 45 mins from their house to get there. 

USUALLY we stay in my parents campsite but since we have a kid this year, we opted to get our own, more privacy and in the shade for kiddo to nap. 

We had discussed that we got our own campsite to the in laws. I guess they just assumed they were invited to come stay the whole time? 

Anyways over dinner tonight at their house, my mother in law asks what day she can come stay. My husband says to come for one night. She did not like this answer and said “I thought we were coming up for the whole time”. 

I explained that we arrive at 12 pm and will be unpacking that afternoon and will be relaxing, the next day I have my friend and her husband that were staying a night with us and that they were welcome to join us the next day and stay the night then we check out at 12 pm. 

She is obviously upset at the fact we don’t want them there our entire trip. I know they want time with their grandchild. I feel bad but honestly it’s my family camping trip, I want to go spend time with my parents and cousins and want to do so without lugging around my in laws everywhere. I feel slightly uncomfortable too because this is my parents trip and I don’t want them to feel obligated to entertain. 

Anyways, I feel like crap after tonight, AITA?

Edit: for context, we live about 4 hours away from my in laws, they see our kiddo probably once a month for a few days. The same goes for my parents, time shared with their grandkid is the same across the board for both sets of grandparents.

She is obviously upset at the fact we don’t want them there our entire trip. I know they want time with their grandchild. I feel bad but honestly it’s my family camping trip, I want to go spend time with my parents and cousins and want to do so without lugging around my in laws everywhere. I feel slightly uncomfortable too because this is my parents trip and I don’t want them to feel obligated to entertain. 

Anyways, I feel like crap after tonight, AITA?

Edit: for context, we live about 4 hours away from my in laws, they see our kiddo probably once a month for a few days. The same goes for my parents, time shared with their grandkid is the same across the board for both sets of grandparents. ",0.0,0.007901661098003387,0,1
113,1e7ojvc,AITA for requesting my mother lower the volume of the video on her phone because it was making my ears hurt?,"I was using my PC in the study room and my mother was in the same room watching a video on her phone. Her phone was on loud speaker because my mother says she cannot use earphones due to tinnitus. The video's volume seemed really loud to me and my ears were actually hurting, so i tried asking her if it was possible to lower the volume. It was also loud enough that she could not make out what i was saying over the sound of the video.

When she realised what i was saying, she got very angry, started shouting that it was already on the lowest volume (i think she meant the video specifically, because the loudspeaker volume was very loud), that the room/house belonged to her, I was being ungrateful, I have no right to complain, etc, etc. 

She also said i could use earphones instead (my earphones are the old school earbuds type, they do not block sound at all and i did not want to listen to music at the time) and decided to retaliate by refusing to give me any more money for the things i buy for the house (e.g. aircon servicing, groceries, etc). She then went to complain to my father, but he knows what she is like so he just kept quiet after she started shouting that she didn't want to use earphones.

114,1e7oiex,AITAH for not paying my BIL back for their wedding photo editing,"UPDATE: I spoke with my sister this morning. I told her what BIL said last week and texted her a screenshot of the request. She knew. It was her idea. She said she knew I was self conscious and she wanted to show how beautiful I could be. She also asked if I was going to reimburse them or if she should ask my dad. Apparently BIL has been stressing about the cost (though he’s not paying) because his parents keep mentioning it. His grandfather is a local politician and his dad the CEO of an insurance company. They’re doing very well financially. 

I told my sister how upset I am and that I’m shocked that we’re having this conversation. She said it’s not a big deal and she knows I’ll be happy about this when I’ve lost more weight. I then told her that I find it ridiculous that she had me in her wedding party if that’s how she feels. She got mad saying I’m being ridiculous to think I wouldn’t be in her wedding. Basically I told her that I’m incredibly upset and I don’t know how to feel about our relationship. 

I then called my parents and told them we’re not coming to dinner this weekend. My parents are upset and said they see why I’m upset but they also kind of agree with my sister. My dad (who goes to the gym multiple times a day) said he’s proud of me and he knows I can get healthy and that he’s sure this won’t be a big deal in a year or so. He then told me he was going to pay BILs parents and to not worry about it. 

Literally no one has ever made comments to me about my weight but looking back I think I’ve always been compared to my sister. She was literally homecoming queen every year and I remember my mom asking if that upset me. She was a freshman and I was a senior. I was just doing my thing in the chess club and science honors society not giving a shit about how pretty and popular my sister was. I was happy for her but looking back I think that I’ve kind of been shit on my whole life while my sister’s needs and interests were put above mine. I’m going to schedule a session with my therapist after this because I’m just at a loss.  

Sorry this is so long and ridiculous. 




I (f30) was in my sister’s (26) wedding a few weeks ago. It was beautiful and seemed to be just what they wanted. Last weekend, after they returned from their honeymoon, my sister, her husband, my husband, and my brother went to my parents house for dinner so they could show us photos from their trip and some they had from their wedding (just a few as the photographer was still editing the others??) It seemed like that had a great time on their honeymoon on Turks and Caicos and their wedding photos were beautiful but I noticed that my body had been edited like a lot. 

Some background on me is that I am 4’10” and have struggled with my weight for years. I was put on a steroid for over a year which absolutely wrecked my body in numerous ways. I was barely 100lbs for most of my life but gained 60lbs while on this medication. I was as also diagnosed with PCOS and at my highest I was 190lbs. I know it’s bad but I lost 25lbs over the past year and after having a watermelon sized tumor removed from my ovaries last fall I was able to lose 15 more lbs. I was doing my best to look good for their wedding. 

My sister is a natural blonde, she is tall, beautiful and the absolute sweetest person on the planet. She is also a nurse and was in a sorority. Every single one of her bridesmaids were tall, thin, and blonde. Her now husband has never been my favorite person but his family is amazing and they are close with my parents. Based on photos shown at their wedding showers and other events, it appears that for a majority of his childhood, he was quite overweight but had since become very into fitness and has completed triathlons and other similar competitions. 

So, after our family dinner I was outside alone with my new BIL and he looks at me and says that their photos are taking so long to be returned because they had to have every single picture I’m in edited. He specifically said that they had to “edit out my jowls”. He said in a semi joking manner that I owe him $250 for having me photoshopped and delaying their wedding photos. I looked at him and said I hope you’re joking because that’s rude and also what the hell. He pulled up one of the photos where all the bridesmaids are surrounding the bride and I’m in the front (because I’m by far the shortest) and said that this photo should have been so beautiful but I’m taking up too much space in the front and it couldn’t be fixed. I just looked at him, said nothing and went inside and got my husband and we left. 

I don’t know if I should pay him back or tell my sister or what. My husband said I should tell my parents and sister what he said but I don’t want to start any drama. 
AITAH if I don’t pay him back?


Edit to add that the initial interaction happened last Saturday and he sent me a Venmo request on Wednesday which is how I know it’s not a joke. I know weddings and photography are expensive.

Today, he called his mom and let her know we’d be to their place around 6:30. I thought that she was just going to go with us.

Then he says it was rude of me to just get up and leave and that I should apologize to his mom. I try and say you said this was fine and we could go get poke, you said this was what you wanted to do too.

120,1e7n9ms,AITAH for not talking with my brother for wrecking my motorcycle?,"TL;DR
My brother wrecked my new bike trying to show off and now I can’t even talk to him bc of how upset i am. Ik he feels guilty and he’s sorry but I can’t shake how angry I am at him.

Yesterday I finished my MSF course and got my motorcycle license. To celebrate, me and some mutual friends of my brothers, got together and rode to his house. He doesn’t own a bike but swears up and down he knows how to ride and can handle anything and I’ve let him ride it a little bit before. When we got there I went inside and talked to his girlfriend for a bit while he was outside helping a friend work on their bike. When I go back out there he’s waiting by the door and starts his sentence with “before you get mad”. I look past him and see our friends lifting my bike out of the grass assessing the damage. He proceeds to explain to me that he just wanted to do a lap in the yard(it’s a street bike and isn’t meant to be ridden in grass especially wet grass). What he left out was he was trying to fishtail the back wheel to impress his friends and in doing so, the back tire slipped out from under him and the bike flipped on top of him breaking the left mirror, left foot peg, and bending both the handle bar and clutch. I lost my mind after seeing he wasn’t injured and was yelling at him for a solid 10 minutes straight and he was just rolling with the punches.

TL;DR
My brother wrecked my new bike trying to show off and now I can’t even talk to him bc of how upset i am. Ik he feels guilty and he’s sorry but I can’t shake how angry I am at him.

Yesterday I finished my MSF course and got my motorcycle license. To celebrate, me and some mutual friends of my brothers, got together and rode to his house. He doesn’t own a bike but swears up and down he knows how to ride and can handle anything and I’ve let him ride it a little bit before. When we got there I went inside and talked to his girlfriend for a bit while he was outside helping a friend work on their bike. When I go back out there he’s waiting by the door and starts his sentence with “before you get mad”. I look past him and see our friends lifting my bike out of the grass assessing the damage. He proceeds to explain to me that he just wanted to do a lap in the yard(it’s a street bike and isn’t meant to be ridden in grass especially wet grass). What he left out was he was trying to fishtail the back wheel to impress his friends and in doing so, the back tire slipped out from under him and the bike flipped on top of him breaking the left mirror, left foot peg, and bending both the handle bar and clutch. I lost my mind after seeing he wasn’t injured and was yelling at him for a solid 10 minutes straight and he was just rolling with the punches. You could tell he felt bad and embarrassed about the whole thing but I can’t help but feel like he betrayed me and out right disrespected me for not asking and just doing it without caring.

122,1e7myi2,AITA for refusing to wear jewelry my cousin bought me to a wedding after we had a falling out?,"
I (23 F) have a cousin I was very close to growing. I considered her my sister and would do anything for her. Let's call her D (27 F). D lives overseas and has a very lavish lifestyle. It's normally very hard to get in contact with her seeing as she's alway busy. Recent D made her way back home since one of our cousins is getting married soon. She brought a beautifully jewelry set for me from India so that I could wear it to our cousins wedding. The problem arose when I went to stay at my maternal grandmother's house since this is where D was staying. I was due to stay for about 4 days just to spend time with D. I lasted 2 days due to a fight that broke out between us from me asking an innocent question. The issue started when I asked her why she spoke to her father with the accent she uses overseas instead of the accent from our country that she uses with the rest of us. She flipped out on me saying she's so sick and tired of facing backlash for speaking that way when it is how she is required to speak while being overseas and to her students there. I said okay to her and went back to scrolling through my Instagram before she said, ""Can I ask you something? Do you get some satisfaction when you bring someone down? Do you enjoy being negative?"" I'm not going to lie I did end up losing my temper and I told her that I asked her a question out of curiosity and without any malicious intent. If it was an issue for her then she should have answered it the first time I'd asked instead of letting it slide. I asked her a question out of curiosity and if she wishes to interpret it as me bringing her down than she can have at it because I will not be explaining myself over something so small. She nodded at me and was quiet for a bit before saying, ""Thank you for that. Thank you for showing me how you handle situations like this and for showing me my place. It really shows the respect you have for my feelings."" She left the room and went to our grandmother. She told my grandmother I'd be leaving the next day because she needs some space. I was essentially kicked out of my own grandmother's house because one of the grandchildren needed space. I am a very prideful person and truthfully I've never begged anyone to be in my life so I don't see the point in starting now. Upon arriving home I spoke with my mother about the incident and informed her that I need to look for new jewelry for my cousins wedding, my mother graciously said she would look the next time she went shopping. Recently my mother came to me almost begging me to make up with my cousin for her sake since my mother sees D as one of her own children.

123,1e7mu96,AITA for refusing to financially support my sister because she chose to become a single mother?,"I (32M) have a sister, Emily (34F), who has always wanted to be a mother, but she hasn't been able to find the right partner. After years of waiting, I suggested she consider IVF treatment. I even helped her research the process and find clinics. She loved the idea and decided to go ahead with it.

Emily had the financial means to afford IVF on her own, but it meant she had to cut back on creature comforts and luxuries for the foreseeable future. Two months ago, after her fourth round of treatment, she got pregnant. The whole family is very happy for her and she's happy too. She didn't expect it to take so many rounds of treatment, though, so the bill ended up higher than she was prepared for. She does have enough money to support herself, but not very comfortably. She asked our family for help so she wouldn’t have to make even more sacrifices. Our parents are retired and living on a fixed income so they can't contribute much. This leaves me as her main source of potential financial support.

Last week Emily sat me down and asked me for money. I have no issue with people choosing to be single parents if they can afford it. But I don't believe it's fair to ask others to finance such a personal choice especially when there are significant long-term financial commitments involved.

I have a wife and a newborn son. While we do have some extra money, we're using it to keep our own little family comfortable and save for a bigger house (currently live in a single bedroom condo). I told Emily that I wouldn't be able to help her foot the bill.

Emily was heartbroken and furious. She argued that family is supposed to support each other and that I'm being selfish and judgmental. Our parents are also upset with me, saying that I'm not being a good brother. They think I should help her because she's family and this is her dream. They're especially upset because it was my idea and I helped her research it. I offered to help Emily by letting her eat dinner with us nightly since she lives nearby and letting her use my car which is cheaper to run since it's electric. She said that's not nearly enough.

I have my own family to think about and financial goals to achieve. I feel it's unreasonable to put myself in a difficult financial position for something that is Emily's personal choice, even if I initially suggested it. So AITA for not supporting her financially?

ETA: My sister is a homeowner with a *slightly* bigger house than mine, making *slightly* more money than I do. She can absolutely afford a child. She took from savings to pay for the fourth round of IVF and is rebuilding it as fast as possible by not spending. It isn't like she didn't budget, she just doesn't like being frugal. She also did take me up on the offer to temporarily trade cars and eat dinner with my family nightly. IVF was not my first suggestion. She wouldn't adopt because she wants a biological child. She did not use donor IUI because she wanted PGT done to ensure she'd have a boy because that's what she's wanted since high school. I was not involved in her treatment or consultation and I don't agree with her decision, I helped her research because I was trying to be a good brother.

124,1e7mt77,"WIBTA for not allowing my GF’s younger brother, mother and dog to sleepover at our place anymore? ","My gf (28F) and I (28F) been living together for four years now. We have three cats. Our place is small, however, it is nice and snug for the five of us. 
My GF’s family consists of her mother (single, 49), younger brother (13) and a labrador dog which they purchased years after my GF moved out. They live 45 minutes away by car.

Over the years, they have slept over at our place with their dog each time. It is only recently where I’ve realised that these sleepovers are extremely tiring, mentally and physically. We don’t allow shoes in the house but her younger brother doesn’t listen and walks around the house with his shoes on. My gf has told him off many times but her mother stops her and says in a stern tone that she knows how much of an inconvenience everything is for my GF. She got mad for enforcing such rules. We have also asked them to wipe their dog’s paws before he enters our house but they rarely do so. Our cats also become visibly stressed with the change in environment. 

There has been two incidents over the past couple of months that have upset my GF’s mother.
1. Our cat was suffering from urinary crystals and our vet informed us that it was crucial he remain stress free as he recovers. Due to this, we didn’t want their dog staying over for this sleepover. Her mother believes their dog is my GF’s grandmother reincarnated who passed away three years ago. She said“how could you not let your own grandmother stay over?” when we tried to explain that our cat is very unwell. Ultimately, her mother and dog did not sleep over that day. We spent the day looking after our cat as well as hanging out with her younger brother who constantly wants attention. Her mother was angry for a week.
2. Two weeks ago, gf’s younger brother slept over again, however, neither of them told us that he was sick with a cold. When we asked him why he didn’t tell us, he said he didn’t want to miss out on sleeping over. Last week, I started to feel sick and realised that I may have potentially gotten a cold from him. My GF messaged her mother that in future, it would be better for him to stay at home when he’s sick and to also inform us before we meet if one of them is unwell. My GF’s mother was offended and said that it is unreasonable as we have a better immune system than him. GF hinted that future sleepovers are difficult as it is too tiring for us to host but she said that because she is a single mom, she wants to stay with us every now and then. Her mother also said she couldn’t believe that my GF made it all about her.

I suggested we hang out with them for one full day or have two day time hang outs instead. My gf feels bad which is  understandable but this also seems unsustainable.

127,1e7lg24,AITA: An elderly friend wants half of my prize money I won….9 months ago.,"Backstory; I had never been to the races, I was unaware of any dress code or what to expect. This elderly lady and I became really close based on her extensive knowledge of fashions on the fields and race day etiquette and my eagerness to learn and share in this with her. 

This lady friend lent me a hat and purse for a huge Horse racing day. I was very grateful. 

I spontaneously entered into the fashions on the fields and ended up winning the day and was invited back for the chance to compete in the top 10. 

Whilst I didn’t win $40,000 top prize, I did win $1,500. 

Since then she has been invited to my wedding, our growing love of horse racing and fashion, coffee dates, drinks nights and the like. 

Fast forward 9 months later, she brings up that she thought I was upset with her all this time because I didn’t give her half my winnings ($750) for her being my “stylist”. 

Just a highlight my previous point, she had “lent” me her hat and purse - to which I returned to her. I had purchased my entire outfit, hair and make up on my own. We had zero conversation of “styling fee” or expectation of an exchange of monies. In no way did I agree that this would be a business transaction. 

I genuinely thought we were bonding and building such a close relationship based on a common interest. To say that I’m gutted and blindsided and frankly, very sad about all of this, is an understatement. I feel so weirded out by this whole conversation and awkward about our friendship now. 

AITA for not paying her what she is asking 9 months after the fact? 

How do I tell her that I will not be paying but I don’t want to lose her friendship?

This elderly lady and I became really close based on her extensive knowledge of fashions on the fields and race day etiquette and my eagerness to learn and share in this with her. 

This lady friend lent me a hat and purse for a huge Horse racing day. I was very grateful. 

I spontaneously entered into the fashions on the fields and ended up winning the day and was invited back for the chance to compete in the top 10. 

Whilst I didn’t win $40,000 top prize, I did win $1,500. 

Since then she has been invited to my wedding, our growing love of horse racing and fashion, coffee dates, drinks nights and the like. 

Fast forward 9 months later, she brings up that she thought I was upset with her all this time because I didn’t give her half my winnings ($750) for her being my “stylist”. 

Just a highlight my previous point, she had “lent” me her hat and purse - to which I returned to her. I had purchased my entire outfit, hair and make up on my own. We had zero conversation of “styling fee” or expectation of an exchange of monies. In no way did I agree that this would be a business transaction. 

I genuinely thought we were bonding and building such a close relationship based on a common interest. To say that I’m gutted and blindsided and frankly, very sad about all of this, is an understatement. I feel so weirded out by this whole conversation and awkward about our friendship now. 

AITA for not paying her what she is asking 9 months after the fact? 

How do I tell her that I will not be paying but I don’t want to lose her friendship?

The job is pretty draining on them so they look forward to potentially using the tv to relax after a hard day. And I 100% understand that part and am willing to accommodate them.The only thing I don't know is if I am in the wrong for an argument we had about it tonight. 

I was playing my game for half an hour at least so far and they asked if they could use the tv
I agreed and turned off my game to give the tv over but a while passes and they still don't use it/put anything on. 

I asked them  if they are still gonna put anything on and what but they said they didn't know. 
A while passes after that and they still haven't put anything on. 
I ask again, this time asking if I should just play my game again if they are not interested in using the tv anymore.
They said they didn't want to watch me continue playing my game. 
So again I asked what/if they are gonna put anything on and they again said they didn't know. 
At this point I became pretty annoyed and said ""if you're not putting anything on, then why can't I use it to play my game again?"" 
They got mad that I kept asking and said ""just because I'm not putting anything on at the moment doesn't mean I'm not gonna use the tv eventually."" 

We continued to kinda go in circles with the argument and in the end they didn't put anything on anyway and left the room.

131,1e7kcp8,AITA for not being the “bigger person” for once?,"Hi everyone.

My brother told me to post here to get an unbiased opinion on whether I was wrong in this situation. He is on my side, but my parents and dad's side of the family think I went too far. 

To start, I’m not racist nor do I think better of myself for being mixed. I just got tired of my cousin’s constant racial remarks towards my Indian side. Growing up, my cousins on my dad’s side would bully me and my siblings for being half Indian—calling us ugly, stinky, mocking my mom’s beliefs and accent, and saying Indians are the most unwanted people on earth. My dad always defended us. I love being Black and am proud of it, but I hate my dad’s side of the family for hating my Indian side.

My (F22) cousin “Sarah” (F24) continues this behavior today, brushing it off as teasing. Every time I see her, she mocks my Indian culture and then claims she’s joking. She defends herself by saying Indians are always racist to Black people and I’ll never know what that’s like. She believes biracial people will never understand being fully Black and have no right to certain parts of Black culture. We used to argue about this all the time, and she uses my engagement with my Indian culture as proof I’m not “with the culture.” Every time I defend myself, my parents and siblings tell me to be the bigger person. I’ve tried to avoid her.

Recently, we helped my cousin on my mom’s side with her elaborate Indian wedding, and it was beautiful. Sarah is also getting married this summer. We weren’t as involved in her planning, which pissed her off. After my cousin’s wedding, she sent me long texts accusing me of being biased towards my Indian side and never loving my dad’s side of the family. I replied with the “I’m not reading allat 😭” meme. I’ve heard it all before, I don’t need to hear it again. This triggered her, and she sent racist slurs, calling me half Black, half ugly, and saying Indian women are the ugliest group of women and the world would be better off without Indian people.

Here’s where I might be the asshole. I replied, “but whose hair are you wearing on your head right now?” and took screenshots of her messages before blocking her. Sarah often wears sew-in weaves and jokes about the hair being from “my people.” I know Black women have a complicated relationship with their hair, and what I said hurt her. She told her parents, who told mine, and they lectured me about being the bigger person. I showed them the screenshots, and they understood but still want me to apologize. I told them I’m not apologizing until she does. I know it’s immature, but my cousins have always been like this, and I’m tired of defending myself and always having to be the bigger person.

I’m just so tired of my dad’s side of the family constantly demeaning me and my Indian culture. I know I shouldn’t have said what I said, but now that I stooped to her level, I hope she can see how it feels.

132,1e7k8k0,AITA for contacting the owner of a street cat?,"My girlfriend and I were walking back home from work when we came across a nice little collared kitty around a busy street in Montreal. It was crossing the street all nonchalantly and came over to see us and rubbed itself on us, which is highly unusual here because strays and outdoor cats are all over the place but always shy and run away.

It did try to bite and swat my hand when I moved too abruptly, but it never tried to claw me, which reinforced the idea that it may be a lost indoor cat. So after several minutes of debating whether we should do something and get involved (e.g. call the city's animal center - SPCA), I thought to take a look at the capsule on its collar. Indeed, inside the capsule was a piece of paper with the name, email, and phone number of the owner which we decided to call and make sure the cat wasn't lost.

However, doing so spooked the cat, which ran off and wouldn't let me approach it anymore to put the capsule back on. We ended up following it to its home a few corners away where other cats with similar collars were waiting and where the walls of an old apartment building were plastered with info about how the cats aren't lost, they're being fed, including more info to contact the same owner about other lost cats, etc etc. But at this point, the cat didn't trust me anymore to put the capsule back and leave it.

So we did the only sensible thing to do and called the owner to let her know we had the info capsule we wanted to return. She sounded annoyed on the phone and told us to ring the doorbell, which we did. We apologized and handed over the capsule, but she proceeded to insult us, letting us know how much of an idiot we were for trying to get the info on a collared cat (I don't really get that part). We told her we simply love and care for animals, to which she replied we shouldn't anymore, which gave us the impression she doesn't care for her pets or that this happens often.

Did we cross a line by contacting them? Should we have taken more steps before detaching the capsule from the cat's collar?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-20,"AITA for contacting the owner of a street cat?

133,1e7k3xq,WIBTAH if I didn’t invite my dad to my wedding,"
I 22 f am marrying the love of my life 22 m next year. We are very excited and can’t wait to start our life together. I am struggling to decide if I want my dad at my wedding. For context my mom and dad got divorced when I was 3 years old. They did not have a heathy relationship. 
My mom left my dad and met her long time boyfriend we’ll call him Mike soon after. We were broke after the divorce. My mom was about to get evicted when Mike suggested we move into his house. Mike has been our rock. 
After my dad found out my mom started dating someone and moved in with him he refused to see us for months because he wouldn’t come to Mikes house to pick us up. Once my dad finally saw us he convinced me Mike was a horrible man who took Daddy away. I was three and believed my father. I hated Mike for a very long time because of that. But Mike never gave up he was patient and kind even when I was horrible to him. 
My dad is very narcissistic and mentally/emotionally abusive. I was always doing something wrong. My dads favorite way to punish me was to scream at me in the car while he drove us to his house, which was half an hour away from Mikes. He would wait until he had us alone and nowhere to go. This has caused me a butt load of trauma that I have been working through with my lovely fiancés help. That just scratches the surface of things my dad did when I was a kid. 
I didn’t talk to my dad for two years but when me and my fiancé were talking about getting engaged I decided it was time for him to meet my dad. The meeting itself went fine. After that we had very limited contact. I received a call from my dad a couple of weeks ago. 
He asked me how wedding planning was going and I told him the important updates. He then asked if I was inviting him. I told him he had to promise not to talk to certain relatives on my moms side that want nothing to do with. He asked when have I ever bothered them I don’t bother them. I told him yes dad you do. If you want to come you have to promise not to talk to them. He then said well I don’t know about that. 
He asked me who was walking me down the aisle. When I was 8 I told my dad I wanted him and Mike to walk me aisle he flipped out saying I don’t know why you would want that he is not your father. I brought that story up and he said hmm. I told him that if he wanted to walk me down the aisle he would have to do it with Mike too or that he could come as a guest. He then told me that my second option isn’t really an option because he would not watch another man walk his daughter down the aisle because it would be too awkward. I ended the call shortly after.

135,1e7jwna,AITA for giving my boyfriend’s niece a pair of earrings?,"I (42F) asked my bf (40m) to give earrings to his niece (15) for her birthday from me as I was not attending the party. He also had the receipt to give to his sister in case his niece wanted to exchange them. The party was yesterday, I found out 36 hours before, so I did not have time to buy her something. My bf was giving her money in a card which he picked up on the way to the party. 

The week before the party I had a photo shoot for work. I had my make up done in a mall, while there I realized I forgot my earrings so I stopped at a well known jewelry store that specializes in crystals, like figurines, earrings, necklaces, pens etc. I bought a cute pair of earrings in the shape of a bow. When I got to the shoot they didn’t match the vibe of my outfit so I didn’t wear them. I wasn’t sure if I was going to keep the earrings or return them as money is kind of tight. However, when I found out about the party, I thought I would give my bf’s niece the earrings. I had only tried them on once and then put them directly back into the box they came in. It wasn’t that I didn’t like them, they were beautiful, money was just tight and I could’ve used the $155 back. I told my boyfriend when I bought them I didn’t know if I was going keep the earrings or take them back, he also knew that I didn’t wear them for the photo shoot and had only tried them on. 

Before he left for the party he said he did not want to give her the earrings but could not tell me why he did not want to give them to her. I said that it worked out really well. If she chose to exchange them then she would have a good amount of money to spend in a really nice store and she could get anything she wanted, either way she would have a gift from me and my dilemma of what to do with the earrings would be solved. 

I like to be a generous gift giver. My son says that I’m “extra”.  I had only met his niece a few times since Christmas so I thought my gift was an appropriate amount of money. As it turns out he thought that my gift was “distasteful” and that I had forced him to give his neice my “junk I didn’t like”, a gift “she had to work for” (do an exchange). He brought the gift and receipt home because they couldn’t return it for the money since I had paid with a credit card. I asked him why would I buy earrings I didn’t like? that makes no sense? 

I wouldn’t want to insult anyone and try to go over the top in everything I do for other people. He knows this about me. We have known each other for a while but have only been hanging out with each others families since Christmas. I’m not sure what exactly he told his mother but she also thinks my gift was “distasteful”. As it turns out the niece did not have pierced ears which I did not know or notice in the five times I have seen her. My bf who has known her for her entire life did not know either but he said it’s another reason it was a not a good gift and he slept on the couch last night over this.

So AITA?
",Not the A-hole,2024-07-20,"AITA for giving my boyfriend’s niece a pair of earrings? I (42F) asked my bf (40m) to give earrings to his niece (15) for her birthday from me as I was not attending the party. He also had the receipt to give to his sister in case his niece wanted to exchange them. The party was yesterday, I found out 36 hours before, so I did not have time to buy her something. My bf was giving her money in a card which he picked up on the way to the party. 

The week before the party I had a photo shoot for work. I had my make up done in a mall, while there I realized I forgot my earrings so I stopped at a well known jewelry store that specializes in crystals, like figurines, earrings, necklaces, pens etc. I bought a cute pair of earrings in the shape of a bow. When I got to the shoot they didn’t match the vibe of my outfit so I didn’t wear them. I wasn’t sure if I was going to keep the earrings or return them as money is kind of tight. However, when I found out about the party, I thought I would give my bf’s niece the earrings. I had only tried them on once and then put them directly back into the box they came in.

136,1e7jfps,AITAH for not paying for the bride’s children to attend the bridal shower,"One of my friend’s from college is getting married next month. It is her second marriage, but this time she is really in love and has found an amazing guy. My friends and I are all extremely happy and excited for her. 

I felt honored when she asked me to be one of her six bridesmaids. I do not live in the same state as the bride, but we’re all on the East Coast. I have not worked consistently since March and was unable to attend the bachelorette party which was in the Southwest. Myself and another bridesmaid did  not attend the bachelorette party, but we did contribute to the AirBnB cost along with the cost of the bride’s massage. When our friends said they wanted to pay for the AirBnB for an extra day so they could check in early, we also contributed to that cost. My friends even sent me a text requesting $11 to cover one meal for the bride and another text for $20 to cover a different meal for the bride during the trip. We also pitched in both times.

The bridal shower brunch is coming up and will take place in the state where the bride resides. I am traveling for the bridal shower and volunteered to take the lead on games for the event which is equal to the cost of materials for four bridal shower games. 

One of the bridesmaids informed our group that the bride would like her two children (18, 10) to attend the bridal shower brunch. The maid of honor offered to cover the cost of one child ($60) and the bridesmaid maid who shared the request  to the group asked if anyone else wanted to pay for the other child. I love the bride’s children and whenever I visit, I give them gifts because they’re great kids. However, I am paying for my travel to the bridal shower and wedding. I feel financially tapped out and said I cannot pay for one of the children. One of the bridesmaids asked if we can split the cost ($12/each) to cover the child and I said no. 

AITA for not chipping in $12?

137,1e7jcc5,AITA for telling a group of women to leave my son's hospital room so I could dress him in private? ,"My 9yo son Loren had his appendix removed this morning. He had a basic understanding of the surgery but the only hang up he had was having to wear nothing but a hospital gown. No socks or underwear. When we got to the hospital room to get him prepped, he told his mom/my ex and her sister/his aunt to turn or to leave when he had to undress. Obviously he was fine with my being there and needed help.

After the surgery, me, my ex,her sister, her 13yo niece and my 18yo son were in the recovery room. He were waiting for Loren to sober up and get discharged. He started to come to and whispered to me that he wanted to put clothes on because wasn't comfortable wearing nothing but a gown in front of three girls.

At that same time, a female nurse came in to get his vitals and was talking to my ex. I asked if they could all step outside so I could help Loren get dressed. They looked bewildered at my request. The nurse then said she'd help me dress him because my son was still a bit weak. I said no thanks. My teen son will help out. 

She asked if I was serious by asking her to leave over this and I said yes. My son doesn't feel comfortable getting dressed in front of four females. The nurse said she's been a nurse for years and has heard of anything crass. I said you're comfortable, my son isn't and your being insensitive is what's crass and clueless. My said I was being dramatic. They left and me and my other son got him dressed.

My ex called me and said that I owe her and everyone else an apology. I refused. I said if the roles were reversed then you'd have a very different opinion. Also Loren has to take a bath for the next few days and she was crazy if she was expecting Loren to let her wash him or even be in the bathroom with him. It's different with me or his brother or friends and I don't have to convince her for me to be right. 

Edit: For the record, the gown he was wearing was made out of paper. It wasn't even cloth. My son was dying to get out of it. He was basically naked.

I don't think my son would had minded a male nurse at all but since me and my older son was there the thought of requesting a male nurse didn't cross my mind.

I don't know if they had a male nurse available at that moment because the nurse made a comment that they were short staffed but all qualified. I wasn't going to argue with her over who got to put on my son's Minecraft underwear or zipped his hoodie. It's a waste of my time. She did mention how she didn't want him to get hurt with my dressing him and I said then you best let me handle it because he'll fight you.

Update: I did have to take him back to the hospital this morning because he couldn't pee but had to. He was in a lot of pain.

At the hospital, I àsked if a nurse was going to see my son before or after his male doctor and they said yes. I asked for a male and they said they'd ask the head nurse. She asked why it was so important to have a male nurse. I told her we can schedule an appointment to fight over it after my son sees the doctor.

They did find a male nurse and my son was totally relaxed around him. The male nurse said a lot of female nurses take it personal when patients ask for a male nurse and it's always been that way. 

Fortunately my son didn't need a catheter and is fine.
