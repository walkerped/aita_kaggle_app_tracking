0,1e8t1ph,WIBTA if I called out my trans cousin?,"As a bit of a back story. 

Recently my cousin came out as trans mtf. Which is great. I support her. 

But. She won't make any form of transition. She has the support and resources to do so but yet refuses to do so. I know because she literally told my aunt that she won't transition. But she demands to go into women's restrooms and changing rooms. And I'm starting to think she's only doing it to get into those spaces.

1,1e8dfit,AITA For telling my mom that I can’t get a job to maintain her?,"Hi! I’m currently typing this in tears, so I apologise if it gets kind of weird in some parts.

So I (16f) have lived with my mother (50f) most of my life. Initially, it was us and my grandmother (76f) in our apartment, marked by frequent arguments. My brother's passing due to an assault strained us financially, leading my mom to work long hours and occasionally cope with alcohol, blaming me during her outbursts.
My grandfather's cancer diagnosis during the pandemic added even more stress, leading to constant fights. 

Eventually, my mom sent me to live with my dad (50m), who supported me through depression and accepted my pansexual and transgender identity. I returned to my mom after two years, finding her changed after quitting drinking and starting her own business. Recently, after my grandfather's death by cancer, my grandmother came back to live with us. 

Tonight, when I was making dinner, my mom sat me down and told me that she wasn’t to make it to the end of the month if things were going as they are. She told me that in two days I must have a job that I wanted to apply to, and to tell her so we could start the paperwork. She told me this in a tone that said that it was a closed matter, and that I had to do it. I told her in response that I had looked, and I literally, can’t work anywhere because of school. Then, she just told me to figure it out, because if I didn’t, she would have to kick me out, because she couldn’t maintain other two mouths. That really shocked me, and I told her that if she was so desperate, she could also get a part time job, and I would take care of the house, since I know it consumes a lot of time. But she got pissed by that, and told me that by tomorrow night I really should have something, otherwise, tonight was going to be my last night with her.

What do I do? Was I in the wrong by saying that to her? Should I drop out and find something to help her? Or should I confront her again?

2,1e8a6lp,AITA for telling my husband it serves him right when he got food poisoning after not listening to me?,"So I've (37F) always been a little neurotic about food safety. Some of it comes from having worked in restaurants most of my life, but me and my sister also frequently got sick from my grandmother's cooking when we were kids.

My husband (36M) tends to handwave my ""obsession"" with food safety. It wasn't a big issue until he started learning to cook in earnest about 3-4 years ago. He's no careless buffoon, but when my suggestions are more conservative than Reddit's consensus, he'll get cranky about it. (Ex: if I suggest that he temp something that is almost certainly cooked through, he'll roll his eyes and do it begrudgingly.)

Two weeks ago, as we're unpacking groceries, one of the condiments looks off to me; it's too dark, the oil looks separated, and I strongly suspect it's spoiled. He's the one who buys/eats it, so instead of throwing it away, I point it out to him: ""Hey, this looks weird and I don't think you should eat it. Take a photo, ask for a refund, and throw it away."" He inspects it and agrees that it looks weird but still puts it in the pantry. Over the next few days, as I notice he hasn't thrown it away, I bring it up a few more times to no avail and eventually drop it.

A few days ago, he texts me to say he has to stop working early (he works from home) because he threw up twice. He's hardly ever sick, so I'm like wtf?? Later, when I get an explanation: HE ATE THE DAMN SAUCE and puked it up less than 3 hours afterwards. I'm annoyed, but he looks miserable, so I crush my annoyance down to the size of a pebble, make him a glass of electrolytes, and set him up on the couch with a wastebasket and Darkest Dungeon 2. Additional context for my annoyance: I have a doctor's appointment the next day, and he agreed to come with me weeks ago; I'm nervous about the appointment and don't have anyone else to ask on short notice. The timing sucks, tbh.

Fortunately, the acute phase is over quickly; he's back to 90% (his estimate) the next day and comes with me to the doctor. I've been pretty accommodating up to then, but as he's making himself food, I can't contain it anymore. ""I wasn't going to say 'I told you so' while you were sick, but since you're feeling better: I TOLD you that sauce was off, I TOLD you to throw it away, and look what happened. Hope you learned a lesson."" An argument follows. His points: he checked the expiration date (fine); he smelled it first (fine); him getting sick was a fluke, everything worked out, and I'm being an AH for acting like I knew it would get him sick. My point: I WAS RIGHT.

Now we're at a stalemate; if y'all think I was the AH for kicking him while he was still 10% down, then I promise to apologize. Otherwise, I'm sticking to my guns.

Edit: Didn't expect this to blow up! I'm not much of a Reddit person, but I'll address a few things I see in the comments just for closure's sake. 

1) It was definitely the sauce that got him sick. He works from home and can't drive, so he pretty much never leaves the house, we don't have children, nobody's been over in the last week, the timing made it pretty obvious (he literally only threw up twice and it was right after he ate), and I never got sick despite being around him. He threw it away!

2) Some folks are saying that ""food poisoning"" doesn't set in that quickly, but it definitely can, and it's pretty easy to Google that, so you can do that if you want. There are cool charts and everything!

3) Obviously the character limit reduces stories like these to their bones and leaves them open to infection with whatever twisted personal fantasy you want to project onto them, but for the record: he and I both got a huge laugh at everyone foaming at the mouth to tell me how horrible I sound; we've known each other since we were 14, we are best friends, and we both have anxieties that might make us seem insufferable to other people (see: he doesn't drive), but we do our best and love each other anyway.

4) I apologized, but so did he. Everybody won. ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-21,"AITA for telling my husband it serves him right when he got food poisoning after not listening to me?

3,1e89ylm,AITA for spending time with my boyfriend while my Mum is ill?,"Throwaway account :)

There is such a long history of drama when it comes to me (22F), my Mum (51F) and my boyfriend (25M) - It's always just been me and my Mum, until I met my boyfriend. Because of this, my Mum doesn't like when I spend time with him in general, this has been the same since I started dating him and we've been constantly arguing ever since. She makes me feel guilty for spending time with him, says I don't love her or care about her when I leave her to be with him, and generally makes me feel like such a shitty daughter because I don't prioritise her. 

She has recently been diagnosed with a new long-term health condition, which has led to her being admitted to hospital over a month ago now. Thankfully she's on the road to recovery, and her condition is almost in remission.  She has been put on very strong meds as part of her recovery plan, which are having some nasty side effects. It's common with these steroids to experience quite bad symptoms when coming off them, which is where the problem starts.

She is expected to finish this course of steroids the week my boyfriend has taken on leave from work, as it's his birthday. He gets four (4) weeks off a year, he works over 50 hours a week, so I barely get to see him. 

My Mum was talking about how her steroids finish the same week as my boyfriend's birthday, and she asked if I'd be spending a lot of time with him that week. When I said yes, most likely, we have plans - she completely blew up. We had a big argument about how that makes her feel like I don't care about her. In summary, she says that I'm selfish and I never prioritise her anymore, my boyfriend is more important. 

I think it's an important point to add that I am not her carer. She is fully capable of looking after herself, can drive, my grandparents and brother live very close by. Because I live with her, it seems to always come down to me to make sure she is okay, to keep an eye on her, to make sure she is looking after herself properly. 

I think she is hurt that I'll be spending time with my boyfriend when she'll be experiencing particularly horrible symptoms from her medications, but it's the one week Ill get to spend some quality time with my boyfriend when I barely see him anyway. She thinks I'm being selfish, I think I am putting myself first just for one week.

4,1e89yb5,AITA for confronting my friends for not holding their friend accountable ,"had to limit d/t word count so may be confusing

I'm a 20F who had a friend group w/ Tia 22F, Lee 23M, Clara 22F, & Kylie 22F. K turned on me as planned our grad ceremony w/ Olivia 21F. 

The budget was $375, school venues were no cost, & other venues cost ~$5K. I explained this to our team (w/ K).
Kylie added J ~22F to the gc who complained that we were making selfish decisions (abt the venue). I wrote that it was hurtful to be accused of excluding ppl & we had no money for what they wanted. K said I was hurtful by involving my feelings, suggesting I should quit.
I messaged Kylie I was hurt. She said I had no right to feel hurt bc it wasn't hurtful. She accused me of things I didn't do (ex. hiding info). She threatened to show our convo to the ""entire cohort"", saying they would side with her. Meanwhile, my other friends were with me.

Tia pressured me to call Kylie, as I was sobbing. Lee & Clara agreed. I called Kylie & she was unserious/sarcastic. They urged me to talk to her again; I was hesitant bc she did this after I confided abt my depression and moral scrupulosity OCD.
We had a meeting abt the ceremony & they tried to oust us. Olivia had a panic attack and left. I was angry as they ignored Olivia. I defended her saying we got harassed over this. J denied it saying I had no proof. I replied, ""I have the receipts but I won't show it, bc that's not right."" Kylie thought I was calling her out, but it was abt the gc.
Kylie went to the director about us; he defended us & corrected her. She never rescinded her statements.
My friends and I planned a trip w/o her, but they continued on with Kylie w/o acknowledging what happened. I said I did not expect them to cut her off, just to hold her accountable. It bothered me that they continued on w/o questioning her. I wanted them to tell me that she wronged me.
Kylie's other friends unfollowed me on IG & treated me like air. 
I confronted them about Kylie; they told me ""she did nothing wrong"" & ""it wasn't that bad."" Months later, Kylie denied she did wrong, saying I didn't deserve an apology after calling her out (her assumption). It took 2 hrs to convince her she did wrong. I said if she wanted to make it right, Kylie had to re-read the texts. She refused, saying she wasn't ""mature enough"" and we would never speak again. She also said my friends were aware she felt this way. 
I called Lee, saying that I found out they were deceiving me (they told me K was apologetic and willing to talk it out). I said I wasn't going to get mad at them, but that's what I heard from her. They all avoided me. During that time, I got hospitalized and still no contact.
I asked Lee if I should cancel my flights for the trip. Lee told me he was unwilling to talk to Kylie about what she did and that we should stop being friends. Clara sent a similar message.

8,1e89pq1,AITA for refusing to raise the toilet seat before going to the washroom?,"so recently in my (f16) household, there has been issues with my brother (m21) and dad (midk) leaving a LOT of droplets of pee on the toilet seat. I have voiced my complains almost every time it happens, but nobody has yet to take action. I find this gross, because both are old enough to raise the toilet seat, or clean up after. As for my dad, he has had previous medical issues and his bladder is a bit weaker, but he is not disabled by any means, and can easily clean up after himself. (I also want to mention I have PCOS and incontinence, so I have a weaker bladder as well,) But the issue has mostly been my brother. My mom (fidk) has been trying to resolve this, by coming up with the idea; ""everybody should raise the toilet seat after/before they go to the washroom, so that it's fair."" I found this idea ridiculous, because I am NOT the one leaving piss on the seat, so why should I have to touch the dirtiest part of the seat every time I need to pee? By the way I'm okay with putting down the actual lid to flush (not the seat), and often do, but less often so in the main floor guest washroom, since there are no toothbrushes in there. (where this issue arised) She says that if I don't follow the rule, its only fair that I'm the one left cleaning up the droplets. I think I may be the AH, since I understand that people do forget, or have times where they urgently need to leave after, or whatnot, but I think 90% of the time the extra 3 seconds it takes to raise the toilet seat before pissing is NOT a big ask.

This hasn't been in one lump sum...she counts my share of an interstate move because I couldn't afford it the way she wanted to do it, paid for my car windows to be repaired and registered and a couple of other bills over the past 4 years.

I always get told she's won't hug me or stroke my hair because she's either too stressed or doesn't feel like she wants to because I'm not doing enough her. In the 5 years we've been together, she has not once done anything for my birthday, and one year talking about it she said she was going to get me something so I would shut up about it.

During this time, we have lived together for 38 months. She has paid 8 months rent. For some reason or another she always just stops paying.

11,1e907kj,"AITA for taking my kids out for dinner and leaving my wife at home on Father's Day
","It's been about a month since father's day, and I was reminded of what happened during a family dinner when my wife took a shot at me in front of her parents, saying that I 'left her behind because I was too sensitive' in reference to something that happened last father's day.

So here's the story: Essentially, last mother's day (and every mother's day before hand) I always put in a ton of effort to make the day special. I'd either cook a fancy meal or we'd go out for dinner with the kids and I'd buy her presents and make a card (cliche, I know, but it's tradition). I went all out in preparations, asking her friends to help me keep the entire thing under wraps as I made sure everything was perfect. Overall, it went really well and we had a great day! I didn't do any of this expecting reciprocation on father's day, just to be clear.

But when father's day came around, my wife did nothing at all. There was no effort whatsoever. My kids made me a card—that was about the only saving grace. It was as if she completely forgot about what day it was. When I brought up the idea of going out for dinner in the evening to celebrate since we hadn't done anything all day, my wife snorted and said, 'we shouldn't even celebrate father's day. It's not like you do anything around the house or help out with the kids.'

For context, my wife is currently unemployed (the economy sucks and she's been trying to get a job) so she's been staying at home while I go to work. Admittedly, that does mean she gets the brunt share when it comes to taking care of the kids—but I still do chores and make them dinner every night. And when she was employed, we split the work evenly. I didn't think her snide comment had any basis, and when I tried to ask her what she meant, she freaked out and retreated to our room.

Eventually, I gave up trying to talk to her since she wouldn't open the door. Instead I decided to try and salvage what was left of father's day and take the kids out for dinner. I didn't think it was a big deal at the time.

But after the dinner with her parents last week, I found out she's been complaining to our family about how I do nothing around the house (I do the dishes every night, cook dinner, do the laundry, yardwork, etc.) and how mean I was leaving her behind on father's day.

I get that she was stressed, but I was really disappointed at how she handled our confrontation on father's day and how she's been telling everybody about her grievances instead of just communicating. It's been especially rough as I have begun to receive calls from family telling me to step in and help her with chores when I already have been. Nevertheless, I still feel bad for leaving her behind on father's day, since I would be annoyed had I been in her same shoes on mother's day.

16,1e8yn2e,AITA for Refusing to Let My In-Laws Come Over to Watch F1?,"Hey everyone,

I recently posted about setting boundaries with my in-laws who frequently dropped by unannounced. Things have only gotten more complicated, and I need your judgment on whether I’m being the asshole here.

My in-laws wanted to come over to watch F1 races, something we all enjoy and used to do together. However, given the recent strain and their passive-aggressive comments after I set boundaries, I told them I wasn’t comfortable with them coming over right now. Honestly, I have no interest in spending time with them due to these recent events.

This decision has really upset my wife. She thinks I’m overreacting and that watching F1 together could help mend our relationship with her parents. She’s now insisting that my parents shouldn’t come over either, even though they’ve always respected our boundaries and give us notice before visiting. This seems like a tit-for-tat reaction, which I find unfair.

I get that I might be punishing my in-laws for past conflicts and not giving them a chance to make amends. But I feel it’s my right to decide who I want in my home, especially after the disrespect and disruption their unannounced visits caused.

18,1e8ydcu,AITA for wanting my sisters bf to wake up so that I can take her kids somewhere to eat?,"
UPDATE:
yes I have apologized mainly to my sister since I don't have his number. I only apologized for disrespecting him in his house. I do have to learn to keep my mouth shut even though I just learned to speak my mind, it's a process. I don't think I was wrong in being upset that the plans are being pushed back because someone that isn't part of my plans wasn't awake. I have had people in my life that are big deep sleepers and refuse to wake up so I was obviously pissed off because I don't know the boyfriend even though I have known him since I was 11 and I lived in the same house as him until they both moved out. I know the bad and the ugly parts, none of the good parts of him because apparently the good isn't noteworthy. Thank you everyone for explaining to me why I am the asshole. I will try better next time on the plans and if I have appointments to make and have to get to places but I still want to interact with my neice and nephew and they're not ready I just have to scrap them and go about my day.

P.S. I'm not going to be a submissive little bitch anymore to when someone yells at me. That's not fucking fair.

Original post:

So this happened on Sunday and I am not sure if I am in the wrong. I am 24F, my sister is 33F, her bf is 33M. I wanted to take my niece and nephew out to brunch with my mom so I had to drive over to their house. Once we get there I am informed that we cannot leave until my sisters bf is awake. This confused me because why does a grown man need help being woken up, even if he is a deep sleeper, there are so many ways to find something that works so you can wake up. My sister says his phone is on silent that's why my nephew (13M) has to make sure he is awake, since she would usually call him to wake him up and make sure he is awake. I had other things to do that day so I didn't want to wait around an extra thirty minutes, we did, so we had to change our plans.   
BUT when I was asking my mom downstairs for anymore reasoning for why this had to be done this way, apparently the bf heard (I thought he was asleep, since he is a deep sleeper). He decided to get out of bed yell at my sister or my nephew about something I don't know and came downstairs to ask if anyone has a problem with him having to wake up. I looked around and said ""yes, I do, why do you need someone to wake you up to go to work?"". He said ""you guys don't have to worry about me having to wake up, you could just go"", since I said I have things to do today and cant wait around for an adult to wake up. I then said ""apparently we do since my sister said we have to wait for him to wake up"", then the conversation went in circles and he yelled at my sister. I do not think I was yelling only talking more loudly than normal. Eventually we went to brunch and on a Sunday had to wait to be seated since its popular. Everything went fine until later in the day my sister came over to pick up her kids and asked me ""what was that?"" I told her, ""he should be able to wake himself up since he is a grown adult."" she says that ""I had no right to talk to him like that, in his home (they rent), why was I there if I had things to do. She can treat him however she wants since that's her bf and he is working back to back shifts, so he's tired, asked me why I don't like him."" I said that ""he cheated on her when she was pregnant with his kids"", she said she ""cheated more than him and that he is a good man. I am also not allowed into her house anymore to pick up her kids"". I said ""I don't want to be in her house at all in general, just forced to come in by her kids""  
I hope this makes sense I can clarify anything else if there is a question.

P.S. I believe that they are working paycheck to paycheck and my parents help pay for things for my sister. My sister does not use her money wisely in my opinion. I live at home still.

  
TLDR: I had things to do on Sunday but I wanted to hang out with my niece and nephew.

19,1e8yd1l,AITA for being honest and firm with my mother when she has no sense of boundaries or respecting my desires ,"My fiancé and I are currently planning our wedding for next year. Things are coming together in that we have decided on a venue and we have also decided on an officiant and we are soon going to be deciding on other details. I have a very opinionated mother who was controlling when I was growing up, and I have since tried to reaffirm with her that we can have a relationship, however, boundaries need to be respected. A few days ago, everything was going well, she was asking me about the wedding stuff because she was very excited for us and she just wanted to know how the planning was going so I shared some details with her and there was no mal intent or malice whatsoever. 

All of a sudden, she messages me saying that I should change the officiant to a minister since I am baptized Presbyterian. I love God, however, I also love the officiant whose videos I viewed. I think she will do a wonderful job of our wedding ceremony and I tried to explain to my mother that just because someone is not a minister doesn’t mean they’re not allowed to say a prayer, let alone myself say a prayer at the wedding or my fiancé or literally anybody that is a guest that is sitting there that wants to say a prayer. I told her our decision is not offensive to God whatsoever and that I do feel she is trying to bully us and take control of our wedding although the two of us are paying for it without anybody’s assistance. 


As soon as I sent this message, she told me that I was responding with vitriol when all she was trying to do is offer an opinion and that I’ve made it very clear that I am in control, I told her I don’t mind that she has opinions however it does seem like she’s trying to choose what my fiancé and I decide for OUR wedding. 


My fiancé and I are both extremely frustrated, and it makes it worse that she doesn’t admit that she’s trying to push my boundaries and simply tries to flip the tables when I am finally assertive and standing up for myself. If I give her an inch, she takes a mile and if I don’t tell her anything about the wedding planning, then all of a sudden, I’m a bitch. How can I win in this situation? Also, was in the wrong?

20,1e8ycqo,AITA for telling my brother to not put his shoes on my sunglasses,"Hey y’all. I really don’t think I’m the AH here but I just need some other POVs.

My dog is currently recovering from surgery, and because of that she has a kennel/pen combo right now as her main living space. On top of her kennel I keep things like my sunglasses, her pill shooter (put it in her mouth and shoot the pills down her throat), and other items like her leash and dog booties. 

My brother came home and climbed into her area to pet her. He’d just come from a long morning of practicing in an unknown(to me) park area. While he was in there he took off his tennis shoes and placed them on top of her kennel, directly on my sunglasses and her pill shooter. 

I obviously told him “no” and told him to take them off. He proceeded to tell me it “wasn’t a big deal” to which I replied “dude. Just throw your shoes on the ground. What you’re doing is rude. I wouldn’t do that to you.” He then proceeded to tell me “I wouldn’t care if someone did it to me, I don’t understand why you’re being so nitpicky”. I told him how it was unhygienic in general but especially for something that goes in my dog’s mouth and on my face. At that point he said again it wasn’t a big deal so I started to get up to put his shoes up myself, at which point he start to repeatedly say “ok” over and over and first threw his shoes on the ground and then left my dog’s area so he could put them up himself. He proceeded to mention how it was just felt like I had to win the argument sometime. Which obviously pissed me off. 

In my opinion it’s not even about winning the argument/conversation. It’s literally about education at this point. And the general fact that I don’t want the bottom of his shoes on my sunglasses and my dog’s pill shooter.

21,1e8ycjv,AITA for uninviting my mum from my wedding for calling my fiancées hobby disgusting?,"I (26F) have been seeing my fiancée (26F), we will call Hope, for 7 years. She is on the autistic spectrum and has a special interest in insects, especially spiders. She likes to go outside, collect some insects, bring them home to study or draw or sometimes even embroider before letting them back into the wild. She makes sure to take care of them to the best of her ability. As someone who is deathly afraid of spiders it took some time to get used to but she has helped me get over the fear (to some extent) and it has been lovely to live with.

This comes to a week ago when I had my parents over for dinner. Hope came to the kitchen to help me with the food while we left my parents in the living room. At some point my mum somehow wandered into our office, where Hope keeps her insects she studies. We heard her shriek and a thud. We rushed to the sound and we saw my mum standing over a squished spider with a book in her hand. I asked what happened and she said she saw a spider so she killed it. I don't understand how the spider got out of its jar since it has only happened once in the 7 years me and Hope have been together. My dad stepped in to try and sweep the spider up but hope stopped him and was visibly upset over the spider, borderline in tears over it.

My mum was disgusted at the sight of Hope scooping the spider up and asked why she was upset over a stupid spider. I quickly explained Hopes hobby. My mum yelled that it was a disgusting hobby to have and pushed that it was her special interest and it makes her happiest. My mum just scoffed and said being autistic shouldn't be an excuse for having a disgusting hobby. I told her to get out  and that she was no longer welcome in our house. She started to put up a fight when my dad stepped in, quickly apologised and dragged her out the house.

That night she was very upset about the sequence of events and she asked me if I thought she was disgusting. I comforted her and told her that even though it isn't a common hobby that it wasn't disgusting and even beautiful in its own way. Our wedding is in a month so I asked her if she still wanted my mum at our wedding and she said she wasn't sure if she would be comfortable with my mum there but she doesn't want me to have a bad or no relationship with my mum so she said she'd live if my mum was there. I don't want my soon to be wife uncomfortable at my own wedding so in the morning I sent a text to my mum saying she was no longer welcome at the wedding.

I received some awful texts about how I was betraying the family as well as some texts insulting Hope- words that I don't want to repeat on here, honestly these texts solidified my decision but other people in my family have been messaging me calling me an asshole and to just get over myself so I am starting to second guess myself and think I am overreacting slightly.

My fiancé and I were over at my sister’s house, and I brought up the idea of having my bridal shower there. She made an ugly face and asked why I would want to do that. I explained that it would be cheaper and easier to get everyone together. My sister didn’t even try to hear me out before saying that she didn’t want “strangers” in her home. I asked who the strangers would be, and she said she doesn’t know my friends, she doesn’t know my fiancé’s family well, and she doesn’t want our family to know where she lives.

I tried to be understanding because I know my sister and our family don’t have the best relationship, but they’re not completely no-contact, so I didn’t think it would be a big deal. I told my sister that I feel like she’s trying to make my wedding all about her, and I wouldn’t do this to her if she ever gets married. My sister’s girlfriend then butted in and said she doesn't care that I’m getting married and our parents will never be welcomed into their home.

24,1e8xr9a,"AITA for refusing to wear a bracelet I wanted, but my husband paid for?","I (29F) wanted to buy a bracelet for myself because I finally had a job after searching for a long time and wanted to treat myself. My husband (35M) suggested I buy it from his parents because they run a jewellery store and they’d offer me a good deal. That had been my plan anyway, so when we visited them (they live in another State), I went by their store and had a look at what they had in stock. I decided on a piece but didn’t take it right away, as I needed to withdraw some cash.

A few days later I overheard my husband talking to his Mom about me but couldn’t hear what it was about (context info: there had been some negative talk in the past about my struggling to find a job & I wanted to know if that’s what it was about).  I asked my husband later what they were discussing about me and he said “nothing” but I got the feeling he felt caught out. Then he said they were talking about the bracelet I wanted and he was going to buy it. I said I was happy to buy it for myself but he insisted, and said he’d sort it out. I was thankful and said okay.

Then, after we returned home I asked about the bracelet and he said he was gonna give it to me later, maybe my birthday. I was annoyed because I wanted to buy the bracelet and wear it, like immediately, and that’s what I would’ve done if he hadn’t bought it. He said he paid for it, and that was a nice thing for him to do. I agreed, but said if he kept it, then it felt like he took it from me, and was making me wait to get something that I was prepared to pay for myself.We had a low-level fight about it, after which he said I can just have it right then, but I said I didn’t even really want it anymore because now every time I wear it, I will think about this argument and the whole gesture feels ruined.

We recounted this story to his friends (I don’t have many friends as we moved here recently) and they all agreed that he paid for it, so I should just be happy, but I feel like if he wanted to pay for a gift that I had picked out and was about to purchase myself, then it’s not fair to make me wait months for it.

Am I the asshole for being upset about him keeping it / not wanting to wear the bracelet anymore?

I (29F) wanted to buy a bracelet for myself because I finally had a job after searching for a long time and wanted to treat myself. My husband (35M) suggested I buy it from his parents because they run a jewellery store and they’d offer me a good deal. That had been my plan anyway, so when we visited them (they live in another State), I went by their store and had a look at what they had in stock. I decided on a piece but didn’t take it right away, as I needed to withdraw some cash.

A few days later I overheard my husband talking to his Mom about me but couldn’t hear what it was about (context info: there had been some negative talk in the past about my struggling to find a job & I wanted to know if that’s what it was about).  I asked my husband later what they were discussing about me and he said “nothing” but I got the feeling he felt caught out. Then he said they were talking about the bracelet I wanted and he was going to buy it. I said I was happy to buy it for myself but he insisted, and said he’d sort it out. I was thankful and said okay.

Then, after we returned home I asked about the bracelet and he said he was gonna give it to me later, maybe my birthday. I was annoyed because I wanted to buy the bracelet and wear it, like immediately, and that’s what I would’ve done if he hadn’t bought it.

25,1e8xoaj,AITA for texting my brother a facetious link?,"
I (22F) currently live with my parents, my boyfriend (25M) and my brother (25M). For some context, I have always had issues with my brother for many reasons. He doesn’t demonstrate any respect for others (especially women) and he is incredibly selfish. He never cleans up after himself and makes communal areas gross. Anyway, this has caused me to take issue with his girlfriends because of how gross he is. 

He just got a new gf and it has been causing issues. I work 7/7 with 10 hour days, and after my 6th day (the hardest day of my week) I just wanted to go to bed but i could hear them having incredibly loud sex. My room is right below them so it was very very loud. I texted him to please keep quiet but also called up to them to please be quiet as I am very tired and it’s late. They paused for a minute then kept going. This was incredibly upsetting to me because I actually had not met her at that point, and the first time I hear her voice it’s moaning. This was also her first time at our house. 

Here’s where I might be the AH; I sent him a link to a Temu ball gag and told him to use this next time since you two clearly can’t keep it down and “it’s even in your budget”. The next day he sent me many texts calling me immature and essentially telling me that what I did was significantly worse than what he did. I felt conflicted and talked about it with my therapist to try and understand why it made me so upset since he was so angry with my reaction. Essentially, it’s a trigger for some personal issues in my childhood. My therapist and I talked about it at length and he encouraged me to be there for his gf since my dislike comes from concern. I agreed and did honestly try my best to put that behind me and told myself that she probably didn’t know how loud they were. I asked my brother to be quiet or honestly just do that when no one is home. He told me to wear headphones. I tried that but just knowing what is happening makes me so uncomfortable and I get incredibly anxious. 

They were both so shameless in their behavior that the loud sex has happened a few more times (every time she’s over and I’m home) and each time I feel hurt and angry. And each time I tell them to be quiet but nothing changes. I know that it isn’t anyone’s responsibility to cater to my trauma and triggers but I thought it wasn’t unreasonable to just find another place to do that? Or be quiet? Am I being a prude by asking them to stop? And now that it continues to happen I am getting so mad at his gf as well. She’s not making any effort to be quiet and being very disrespectful in my opinion. I never see them and I can only communicate with my brother via text but he is unwilling to do anything or compromise at all. So I just yell for them to stop and that just makes him angry.

26,1e8xfkx,AITA for unintentionally throwing my gf’s stuffed animal across the room?,"People have been giving me flak for this and my gf has still been upset at me. We've been dating a year. She has a big collection of stuffed animals, it's her thing. I've even bought her a few. Whenever I come over her house we'll sometimes cuddle on the bed, but she always tells me not to lay on her stuffed animals, especially their faces. I honestly thought it was just a cute little quirk of hers, but she even said that she doesn't lay on their faces, or sit on them, or anything that might ""hurt"" them. Again, I get it, I have some prized possessions that I treat carefully too, but its kinda hard sometimes considering her bed is FULL of them (she has a queen bed and they take up like half of the bed).

 I came over a few nights ago and we were both in a playful mood. We were being silly with each other, joking around, and in the midst of us just enjoying ourselves and hanging out, I was making a joke about how I would ""kick"" a hypothetical bee that would ""dare to come near her"" (she has an intense fear of bees). I wasn't thinking when I did this, but I picked up one of her stuffed things to demonstrate, and threw it up before kicking it across the room. She looked at her stuffed animal, then at me for a few seconds, and told me, very plainly, to leave. I thought she was joking, and I started to say I was sorry, but she told me again to leave, this time pulling me out of her room. She wouldn't let me get a word out, and by this time her brother was coming out of his room because he heard the commotion, and I didn't want any problems to start, so I just left.

I tried texting her that night, and she ignored me for a bit, but eventually picked up my call. She told me that what I did was disrespectful and she didn't want to deal with me anymore. I told her multiple times that I was sorry, and if she was seriously going to break up with me over throwing a stuffed animal. She just hung up.

 Not trying to be insensitive, and I didn't say this to her, but its a freaking stuffed animal, it doesn't have feelings, and I already said sorry a million times. It's been now two days, I've given her ""space"" but she says she's still upset. It just seems like an overreaction to me. Was what I did honestly so bad? It was a thoughtless joke I admit, and I'm seriously in love with her and want things to continue, but she's been distant.

My brother had gone to sit in the back of the car afterwards with his gf and my dad wanted to know why he was so upset so I tried to explain it with minimal detail bc my brother doesn’t want to have my parents involved even though they already are and have been for a long time.

31,1e8wjha,AITA for telling my friend she needs to talk to her boyfriend about being disrespectful to me?,"
I (18f) have a friend (17f) who have a boyfriend (15m) in a different country and even though he hasn’t met me, he hates me. 

Me and my friend became friends first day of school 2 years ago and she seemed like a nice girl. After a few months of knowing each other, she started to be away from school a lot and not telling me. She was gone for days and stood me up multiple times. 
Half a year later we became friends with my current boyfriend (18m) who also goes to our school. Around the same time my friend started talking to her current boyfriend online and quickly became a couple even though they have never met. She didn’t tell me or my boyfriend (my boyfriend and her are good friends) and we didn’t get to know until 8 months later. She told us that he knew who we were and had seen pictures that she had sent him without asking us. I also saw that he had edited this photos and made fun of me. They usually visit each other in vacations but she has not let us meet him. Last fall she disappeared from school for 3 months and not telling us anything, the school got worried and kept bugging me about it.
I tried to contact her many times in that period, with no answer. She had openly said before that she often ignores me on purpose and I have asked her to stop doing that because I am worried. I have also specified that she don’t have to reply much, just that she is okay or don’t want to talk at that moment, she said she would but hasn’t changed. 
After Christmas when she was back at school I tried  my best to make plans with her, talking to her etc but she just didn’t really do anything. This was at a time where I had just gotten diagnosed with depression and told her that I need help and support, but she just ignored that. At the same time I lost all my other friends and just had my boyfriend which led to a separation anxiety. Then spring came and she started to talk to my boyfriend about me behind my back, she said not nice things to him about me and pretended like nothing later. Since then I haven’t thought of her as a friend anymore. 
A few weeks ago she reached out saying she wanted to meet and talk, and I said we could do that. We had a nice chat and she apologized. I forgave her and we became friends again. 
Last week we were talking on Snapchat and suddenly her boyfriend started talking to me and saying rough stuff about me and my boyfriend. I sent my friend a text later and asked her to talk to him because it was wrong and unnecessary. Since then she has completely ignored me and won’t answer me. 
This is exactly what I said that can’t happen again if we were to be friends, and I don’t know what to do. I have no friends anymore and I depend on friends, loosing all my friends have given me much problems, I have my boyfriend, but I really need som friends too.

",Not the A-hole,2024-07-21,"AITA for telling my friend she needs to talk to her boyfriend about being disrespectful to me? 
I (18f) have a friend (17f) who have a boyfriend (15m) in a different country and even though he hasn’t met me, he hates me. 

Me and my friend became friends first day of school 2 years ago and she seemed like a nice girl. After a few months of knowing each other, she started to be away from school a lot and not telling me. She was gone for days and stood me up multiple times. 
Half a year later we became friends with my current boyfriend (18m) who also goes to our school. Around the same time my friend started talking to her current boyfriend online and quickly became a couple even though they have never met. She didn’t tell me or my boyfriend (my boyfriend and her are good friends) and we didn’t get to know until 8 months later. She told us that he knew who we were and had seen pictures that she had sent him without asking us. I also saw that he had edited this photos and made fun of me. They usually visit each other in vacations but she has not let us meet him. Last fall she disappeared from school for 3 months and not telling us anything, the school got worried and kept bugging me about it.
I tried to contact her many times in that period, with no answer. She had openly said before that she often ignores me on purpose and I have asked her to stop doing that because I am worried. I have also specified that she don’t have to reply much, just that she is okay or don’t want to talk at that moment, she said she would but hasn’t changed. 
After Christmas when she was back at school I tried  my best to make plans with her, talking to her etc but she just didn’t really do anything. This was at a time where I had just gotten diagnosed with depression and told her that I need help and support, but she just ignored that. At the same time I lost all my other friends and just had my boyfriend which led to a separation anxiety. Then spring came and she started to talk to my boyfriend about me behind my back, she said not nice things to him about me and pretended like nothing later. Since then I haven’t thought of her as a friend anymore. 
A few weeks ago she reached out saying she wanted to meet and talk, and I said we could do that. We had a nice chat and she apologized. I forgave her and we became friends again. 
Last week we were talking on Snapchat and suddenly her boyfriend started talking to me and saying rough stuff about me and my boyfriend. I sent my friend a text later and asked her to talk to him because it was wrong and unnecessary. Since then she has completely ignored me and won’t answer me. 
This is exactly what I said that can’t happen again if we were to be friends, and I don’t know what to do. I have no friends anymore and I depend on friends, loosing all my friends have given me much problems, I have my boyfriend, but I really need som friends too.

34,1e8vzri,AITA for telling my boyfriend to go to a therapist because of his Friday the 13th ‘obsession’?,"So my boyfriend and I are dating for only six months now but I reaaallyyy love him. He’s physically a 10 and personality wise also. However he has a very strange obsession with the Friday the 13th movies and Jason Voorhees.

I’m not kidding. He watches the movies at least once every weekend, he got countless pics of Jason in his camera roll, he named his dog Jason, he got Jason figures, you name it

At first I thought it’s fun and kinda cute but now I feel like it’s waaayyy over the point of that. Almost everyday he shows me some edits of Jason and I can tell that he’s really ‘passionate’ about this stuff. It’s like that’s his whole personality.

I tried talking to him about it today but it didn’t go well. He told me that the franchise comforts him and that he loves Jason, that he always watched it when he was a kid since he got bullied in school.

I advised him to go to a therapist because of it, as I don’t think it’s healthy to be this obsessed with a movie franchise and a fictional character (especially cause he’s a murderer). He got very emotional then, his eyes got red (I’ve never seen him like this before) and said that he’s disappointed that I don’t understand him. His reaction wasn’t that bad but he was clearly upset.

35,1e8vxz8,AITA for telling my mom she needs do things herself?,"I (23F) graduated from university in spring 2023 and have been living at home for a year until I move out again for grad school in August. I have a pretty good relationship with my mom (62F) despite common bickers all families have. My mom has had a habit of relying on other people to do tasks for her. Certain tasks I understand she can't do because of physical inability, time, etc. but there are some things where she could 100% do herself, but will ask my dad or someone else to get it done for her. She never reads instruction manuals and defaults to asking somebody else.



While I'm home, my mom likes to rely on me for those tasks. I usually don't mind it because I like to help out my family. However, I have reminded my mom that certain things she needs to be able to do herself because I won't be here to do it for her. For example, the sound bar disconnected from the TV. Instead of googling how to reconnect it, she had me come downstairs, google it, and fix it.



She's been wanting to connect her HomeLink in her car to our garage door opener for almost, if not more than, 2 weeks now. Today, she sits down with the user manual in her hand for her car, and asks me to google how to do it. I'm willing to do it, but I calmly say to her, ""Have you at least read the manual?"", she answered ""No."" I asked her why she hadn't tried to read it and her response was, ""You know I don't do that."" I tell her that she needs to try to do things herself because I won't be here during school and probably even the summer because my work is transferring me to a branch in the same city as my school. She got upset that I said that and went off about ""God forbid I ask my daughter for help"" and that I always make this same comment.



It's not that I don't like helping my mom, because I do. My issue is that she hardly ever makes an effort to solve a problem or do something before asking somebody else (usually my dad or me) to do it. If she had tried to understand how to link the opener, but couldn't figure out what it meant, then of course I'll help you work through this. But the fact is that she gives no effort and hasn't even tried to look at the manual or any instructions, and then gets upset that I remind her that she has to be able to solve simple things like this on her own. She keeps telling me she'll miss me when I go back to school , but I'm starting to feel like she'll miss me being here to do things for her rather than missing ME.



I just want my mom to take it upon herself to solve these sorts of simple things. It took me one google search of ""How to connect HomeLink to garage door opener"" to find a 1.5 min YT video. I know that this isn't a difficult task to find an answer to. If she had taken the 2 minutes to search and then asked me, ""Will you do this with me?"" then it is a totally different situation.

36,1e8vwgi,AITA for using money provided by my parents to fund my transition when they aren’t supportive?,"Hi, I’m a transgender college student (19F) and have been medically transitioning for about 2 years now. My living situation at the moment is that I go to school in LA for most of the year and go back home to texas for the summer and winter breaks. I’m currently unemployed at both locations due to a variety of reasons, (lack of a car, scheduling, past resistance from my parents, etc.) but I fully plan on getting a job the next time I’m back in LA. I’ve mostly been living off of an allowance provided by my parents with the exception of the amazon gift card compensation I’ve gotten for performing in my school’s haunted house (if you’re curious, I was a zombie schoolgirl). 

 The problem is that this means that I’ve been paying for my transition (appointments, meds, clothes if you count that) using my parents money behind their backs, and in the past they’ve both been less than receptive to the idea of me transitioning, and actively pushed back against it, saying things such as “it’s just a phase” or “we know you better than you know yourself”, calling me selfish because they’d have to explain it to the rest of our moderate traditional east asian family, and even using excuses like “you still like girls though” or “you like spider-man though” to try and disprove it (for the record, love for spider-man defies any and all superficial laws of gender). In fact, their resistance to my identity and chosen expression of said identity is part of the reason I chose to go to school in LA in the first place, though I’m also a film major so that was also a part of it. 

Most of our conversations about this were over 2 years ago when i was a high school senior, and we’ve had very minimal talks about it since then, though those also haven’t gone super well. Now every time I return home for the summer, I have to act like nothing’s changed, still going by my deadname and things like that, and so do my parents. It’s been 2 years of this and it’s driving me crazy, when I’m in LA, I’m free to express myself however I so choose and have a relatively strong support system in case I need anything, but back home it’s pretty much the opposite. It’s gotten to a point where waiters will automatically assume I’m a girl until my parents very loudly exclaim my deadname to “set them right”. My body has changed a lot and I know that I’ll eventually have to tell them, it’s honestly a wonder that they haven’t noticed anything yet, but not only am I absolutely horrified at how they might respond, I also feel somewhat guilty for using the money that they gave me to do something that they expressly said that they didn’t want me to do, and am concerned that they might be more upset at that aspect of everything when I eventually do tell them.

Am I the asshole?

Extra note: My family is pretty well off, my parents are both optometrists and we take yearly trips to Disney World, so I think it’s safe to say that I’m at least not using money from a struggling household to transition.

edit: the money isn’t for living expenses or anything and is purely just so that i have money to spend, it’s an allowance

I'll try to keep this consise. I 20M live at home with my parents and sister. our neighbours are notoriously known for organised crime related to theft.

I was helping some guy fix our fence, when a fairly older man approached us in slight distress and asked us if we knew any information on his bike that got stolen and had an address pinpointed around this area.

39,1e8vm9v,AITA for not agreeing that my sisters feet smell bad?,"I (24f) care for my brother (14m) and sister (19f) due to parental neglect, so they live with me and my (34m) partner.

My partner brought up, about a year and a half ago that he feels my sisters feet/shoes/socks STINK. He was really rude and unpleasant about it originally, and I was very upset, and we have had multiple arguments about this because he couldn’t be reasonable/polite about it, and because I personally don’t smell it!

He continues to say it’s “amongst the worst smells he’s ever smelled” 
My partner also, admittedly has a very strong/sensitive sense of smell 

The issue is, no one else in the house (me or my brother) complains about this, and I personally don’t even smell it, apart from a few occasions when my sisters shoes have been wet from the rain and stinky.

Despite this, I have spoken to my sister about her shoes and she now washes her shoes in the washing machine when she needs to, and keeps her shoes outside to avoid them making the house smelly.

I noticed my partner today literally covering his nose when my sister walked through the lounge to get something.
He covered his nose by putting his tshirt up over his face.

I told him not to do that and that it’s rude and unreasonable.
He thinks it’s a valid thing to do because to him the smell is “so bad it makes him feel sick” and it’s a coping mechanism for him etc.
He’s described it as smelling like rotten milk to him.

I told him he either needs to speak to her about it if he really feels it’s THAT bad, or he needs to stop behaving this way as it is incredibly rude and it upsets me.

Ironically, he doesn’t want to talk to her because he doesn’t want to hurt her feelings, and he doesn’t know if anything can be done as he says it’s not better after she showers/bathes.

This whole thing drives me crazy as I just want him to stop being so unpleasant about this.
I personally find it massively disrespectful.

He says he can’t or won’t change the behaviour unless I can provide an alternative, because regardless of if her feet DO smell or not, he’s experiencing it.

Granted, covering his nose is not as bad as when he was previously complaining about it very rudely to me (and once in front of his mother too, which was mortifying to me) but I still think it’s childish and ridiculous behaviour from a grown man.

My ex(let’s call him Ed) first moved in with me bcs he felt like he overstayed his welcome while living in his friend’s family’s apartment (1 mom, 2 guys, 1 guy’s gf) and he overheard them talking about him being a stressful addition to the household. At the time I was a cashier and just got my first apartment. I was really excited to have a home for myself after 8mths of homelessness, and when I told Ed about it he told me his situation and said he was going homeless, so I took him in. 

Fast forward a few months and we were in a relationship, a few months afterwards I broke up with him bcs he was sexting on social medias and dating apps (+dv). I told him I won’t kick him out bcs I know homelessness sucks, and as much as I resent him for his actions I wasn’t interested in causing that much pain to anyone I had once cared for. Bcs I was young, dumb, and desperate for love, I forgave him some time later, got back together, broke up again, rinse and repeat x4.

Ed didn’t make much working min wage, and I was constantly pushing overtime to save money to go back to school, so I took the lion’s share of our bills. A year later my family decided to rent out their house to us. Ed kept getting fired/quitting and went flat broke. I agreed to help cover his expenses if he pays me back once he gets a job.

Since Ed moved out, he called and texted everyday begging for me to take him back. I said no, but never brought up the debt. A few weeks ago I got so tired of his shit that I told him unless he plans on starting his payments, I will block his number. He called me an ungrateful lying ass hoe.

I work two jobs. I do babysitting full-time and I have a part-time job. There are two toddlers I consistently watch every week and a six-month-old baby I watch on an as-needed basis. 

When I watch the baby, it is always overnight for at least 2-3 nights. I told the mom I would watch her baby for $40 a night. So, if I have the baby for two nights and three days, it’s $80. 

I have babysat the baby six times for 2-3 nights each time. The baby’s mom has payed me the $40 a night I had told her at the beginning maybe once out of the all the times I babysat. There was always a reason she could not afford it. 

I am a very understanding person and just took whatever she offered. However, it is starting to feel like I am being taken advantage of, being that most times I watch the baby she is going out and can never pay what I had told her at the beginning I charge. 

She recently asked me to watch the baby for a couple of days, and I sent a text saying, “I can definitely do that, but just a heads up, [baby name] needs to be picked up/dropped off by 2 pm on Sunday because I have work the next day. The total cost will be $120 since it's $40 a night.” To which she replied the most she could do is $60-80. She then said she would just find someone more in her price range or not get a babysitter, which I understand. If you cannot afford it, I get it. No hard feelings. 

She then asked me a week later if I could watch the baby for 5 nights and 6 days for $100. I declined because two of those days I could not due to my part-time job. And $100 is only $20 a night, so half of what I told her I charge.

They told me they are celebrating a wedding and will not stop letting them off until tomorrow (Monday) and that they are allowed to set them off until 11pm. I said I appreciate that they are celebrating but they are keeping us all awake as every time we settle down for bed one goes off, waking the baby and it takes us ages to calm him down and get him back to sleep. Just as we do, they let another one off. My husband starts work at 6am and isn’t getting a lot of sleep because of the fireworks still going off at 1am and then us having to spend ages trying to settle the baby back down.

",Not the A-hole,2024-07-21,"AITAH for asking neighbours to stop letting fireworks off all night I (35f) have some neighbours who have been letting fireworks off from at least 6pm until past midnight for the last week. When I spoke to them and asked if they could give it a break as it wakes my baby up screaming because they’ve frightened him. They told me they are celebrating a wedding and will not stop letting them off until tomorrow (Monday) and that they are allowed to set them off until 11pm. I said I appreciate that they are celebrating but they are keeping us all awake as every time we settle down for bed one goes off, waking the baby and it takes us ages to calm him down and get him back to sleep. Just as we do, they let another one off. My husband starts work at 6am and isn’t getting a lot of sleep because of the fireworks still going off at 1am and then us having to spend ages trying to settle the baby back down. I get they are entitled to let off fireworks until 11pm but surely a little consideration for neighbours with pets, children and elderly people frightened by loud noises wouldn’t go amiss

49,1e8ukhd,AITA for telling my roommates to be tidier?,"I (25F) moved in with my boyfriend (24M) and another couple that are his friends (21F and 24M) a month ago. In this month, I observed how things would go around the house and simply put, I have had enough these days.

They would go buy groceries and then leave them on the counter and table, all everywhere. Dirty dishes, knives and whatever else that they used to cook would be all around the kitchen. If we wouldn't clean up after them or clean their dishes after they cooked or ate, they wouldn't do it at all and their stuff would stay there for days. Packs of condiments and open jars would always be on the table or kitchen. Let me mention, they also have 3 cats. Cat hair would go in these open jars that they would leave. They only change the cat's litter once every two/three weeks and by that time it just smells awful. Today I almost threw up in the bathroom because they changed it but kept the old litter in a bag that they were supposed to throw away days ago. 

I'm not saying I never left some dishes in the sink, but  when I first moved in, my bf would be the one to clean their dishes all the time and they said that's how it should be because he eats their food that they make. Now, he doesn't eat food with them anymore, but is still expected to clean their dishes. Their laundry was done by him when I first moved in and truthfully, he hasn't done it since, but I'm still shocked that he used to do their laundry and then fold them nicely and give it to them. 

Anyways, back to now, after finally having enough, I sent a message in the group chat saying we need to be more tidy and that I didn't come here to be a maid since I have already cleaned after them and the commune spaces alone around five times. I have also cleaned the bathroom this morning because it was just smelling so horrible. 

What I got back was  texts that I should have told them and that it isn't their fault that I am cleaning alone. Apparently, they never had a problem until I came along, because my bf never mentioned being bothered by their cleaning habits until now. I have also been told I am not special because I work, because even if they're home 24/7 and never do anything, it doesn't mean they don't have stuff to do. I would like to mention they're also unemployed, only afford rent because their families pay for it. There was much more that was said, but there's no point to say it. 

Now, we have came to the decision that we should move out and find apartaments for ourselves, but I feel bad because I feel like I ruined my bf's friendship with them.

Me (15M) and my boyfriend ""Ross""(16M) met at a  wrestling meet a few months ago.

He thinks it's romantic and he has a lil garden in his backyard. I'm a wrestler  yeah but Im not as into sports as he and his friends are and we go to different schools so I don't really hangout with his friends often even Especially since he just came out about 2 months ago.

I do notice he sometimes is more reserved  the few times I've been out with his friends. Like he doesn't want to hold hands as much or really kiss/hug me around them much. I didn't really think of it much because you know some people just aren't into alot of PDA. He's doing summer football training and yesterday we were supposed to hangout  yesterday after he got done.

My mom had to drop me off early at his school  so I got there right before they got done and I had brought him some flowers I thought he might like. When I showed them to him infront of his friends he got all red and I could here them snickering.  He pulled me away from everyone else while they went to the lockerroom and started going off on me about how I  could embarrassed him like that.  Confused I asked him why he was acting like that and he starts telling about how his friends make fun of him  cause  I  always have my nails  painted and cause I treat him like ""The girl""by picking him up or paying for things cause I have a job .  His friends didn't know he liked flowers and  he says their gonna see him differently now.   I tried to apologize  but he was just still mad and told me he'd talk to me later. I called my brother to pick me up.

I talked about with him and thinks Ross is a coward.

We havnet always been very close but we have always been on good terms. We live very far away from each other and whenever we talk it’s like it hasn’t been a day since last time, even tho it’s maybe been a few months.

She is now getting married in late august and I am to be a bridesmaid. There’s 4 bridesmaids including me, where I’m the “big one” of them all. Two of them are size S and one is M/L and me being XL. I’m very short and not evenly distributed (so to speak) and I have very big hips compared to the rest of me, so finding a dress that fits is always difficult for me. I have been honest about this from the start. There was no issue with this in the start, and the bridesmaids were trying to find dresses that could fit us all. The dress finding seemed more difficult than first thought, because of different body times and shapes, with me being the most difficult to fine one to fit. 

The bride have now found a dress she is in love with. The dress is very small in size and is very tight fitting, hugging the body from top to bottom. I told her in private message that I won’t fit the dress according to the measurements. She said yeah it’s not easy, and after a few hours told in the group chat (with the other bridesmaids) that she wants everybody to order it and try it. I’m obviously not buying it because I will not fit it. 

Later I message her saying I will await how the others fit the dress, but if they fit it, it will probably look weird for me to wear a different dress than the 3 others, both for me and also aesthetically for her. So if they fit it I can maybe help with something else or just go as a normal guest. She didn’t seem bothered about the fact that I can’t be a bridesmaid if the dress fit the other 3 people. She just said that the the bridesmaids dresses are just for the pretty pictures and that the bridesmaids doesn’t have any other “duties” to help with than that.

I am now a very sad cause it seams now I won’t be a bridesmaid because of my size. I want the bride to have the perfect wedding, and that by now seams with me not being in it. I will go as guest if it comes down to it, but I feel very swept to the side due to me being too fat and that honestly makes me feel disgusting and unwanted, and really uncomfortable as well. I feel like shit and that it’s “my fault” for being too fat to be a bridesmaid, but also a little bit disappointed in her for not wanting to find a dress that everyone can fit in. 

I don’t really know how to feel about this or if I’m in the wrong here, but I feel like I’m not. I have not told her this yet and I’m not sure if I should. I really don’t want to make any drama, planning a wedding is stressful enough. But I still think it’s really shitty of her. I’m honestly torn about what I should do. 

EDIT: 
We are close, but we are not “besties”, sorry I didn’t make that clear. I see people’s point. This is her day and I should definitely not put my issues on her, totally agree with that. 

I didn’t mention but we’ve only been looking for dresses for 3 weeks, her wedding is in 4 weeks. We have tried dresses before, dresses that fit me, but not the some of the others. The bridesmaids have to pay for the dresses and I don’t have the money to make the dress alterations AND pay for the dress. If I did that would definitely make the dress-shopping problem fixed in no time. Also all the dress shopping in online. Sorry for not clearing that up in the original post. 

Yes I may have opted my self out of being a bridesmaid, but I didn’t see any other choice when the dress wouldn’t fit according to the measurements. I might have been wrong of me and a little hasty. But I don’t see the point in ordering a dress that I know will not fit me? This I don’t understand.

EDIT 2: 
I understand I was the asshole for opting out of being a bridesmaid if the dress was a hit amongst the others, but please be nice. I thought it was a nice thing to do seeing as the bride is stressed enough as it is. I didn’t mean it as an ultimatum of any sort, I really don’t want any drama, that’s why I posted here. It’s her day, and I want it to be perfect. 
There has never been a problem from my side as we have found dresses that fit me, but the others didn’t like. I cannot physically fit in the now chosen dress. It’s not easy to get the dress tailored because of where I live and it will also cost me a fortune, and I don’t have that kind of money. I’m not in the USA and can’t easily order something on Amazon or Etsy or other online stores, it’s not possible where I live and it being so close to the wedding.

I thought it was a nice thing to do seeing as the bride is stressed enough as it is. I didn’t mean it as an ultimatum of any sort, I really don’t want any drama, that’s why I posted here. It’s her day, and I want it to be perfect. 
There has never been a problem from my side as we have found dresses that fit me, but the others didn’t like. I cannot physically fit in the now chosen dress. It’s not easy to get the dress tailored because of where I live and it will also cost me a fortune, and I don’t have that kind of money. I’m not in the USA and can’t easily order something on Amazon or Etsy or other online stores, it’s not possible where I live and it being so close to the wedding. ",1.0,1.06754469871521,1,1
55,1e8u303,AITA for not throwing back neighbour's kids' footballs ,"I moved into midterraced house where I saw the neighbours kid climbing into my garden to retrieve the balls he had kicked over. Given he has to climb an old shed (asbestos roof) I asked him to stop which he agreed to.

Now, I have a full time job which can be more than 12hrs a day so Im pretty much not at home during the week and at weekends I would make the effort to go out and throw the balls back. Until one Saturday morning, I'm having breakfast, planning to throw the balls back once I finish and to my shock I see the dad jumping over and crawling across the roof of my shed. Despite having asked them not to.

So I go out to my garden while he's in there introduce myself politely and say I'd appreciate if they didn't jump over as it's not something I'm keen on and it's not safe as the shed is extremely old and has asbestos roof which is best left untouched and do not want to damage it. (The shed is empty, I don't use it). He apologised and agreed.

The balls kept coming which was fine until it broke one of the windows of on my lean-to greenhouse to the rear of my house. Phoned the dad, he apologised profusely and offered to pay etc but I said not to worry about it as it was old and I will find a work around and just asked the dad to ask his kids to take it easy as sometimes I'm out in the garden with my baby and it's not nice having the balls flying over. He said he understands.

Nothing changed. Couple of weeks later another window broken. Same conversation again. Apologies etc. I brushed it under the carpet to avoid tension.

What really pushed me over the edge is one day I come home to find a broken garden chair next to the shed at the back of the house and it clicked that the kids had climbed over to get the balls back and used the chair to climb back over the shed and in the process broken the chair. I was fuming!! How many times do I have to ask??

So phoned the dad and told him I'd need to get the police involved if people don't stop climbing over into my property and rather than apologising etc he accused me of ""never throwing the balls back"" and ""never being home when they knock"" which royally pissed me off. As I had been throwing them back for more than 2yrs. Not the thanks I was expecting.

After some heated words, he decided put a net up above the fence to prevent the footballs coming over, which works but they still come over some times nowhere near as much as before

And since my last interaction, I have 0 patience for them. I've been left with 2 broken windows, a broken chair and a damaged shed roof (yeah they did end up damaging it!!) with no compensation for it. Rather than saying thanks for the hassle over the 2yrs they are ungrateful and sleazy.

This whole experience was overwhelming for me. While we were driving there, Shawn got a text from a participant asking if we should leave our bags in the car at checkin or bring them with us; Shawn was a bit unsure so asked me for my thoughts. I said that the participant was overthinking it and just tell him to call the tubing company and ask. I wasn't sure if we should tube then turn around via the shuttle and tube again, or tube/take breaks in one trip. Shawn suggested we have a group discussion when we arrived, but I vetoed his idea and said we shouldn't have a group discussion, so decided to just tube/stop. Later on, I found out that Shawn felt hurt by my responses/felt brushed off. 

I got an email from the tubing company but overlooked that they had two addresses, and went to the wrong location. Shawn went up to get us checked in while I stayed behind to blow a cooler tube up, and then found out it was the wrong address. Shawn showed me the email and we went to the right location. 

Once we arrived, everyone was waiting for us except one person. I decided to send everyone, including Shawn, on the shuttle and wait for that person to come and then take her there. Shawn suggested I tell the tubing staff to direct the friend there (and catch up with us) and come with us, because he was holding my cooler and cooler tube, plus his own tube and two cooler tube holders we also ordered. I said no, I would stay behind for the late friend. Shawn looked annoyed and left with the group. I eventually joined them at the tube deposit area and got in the water. Shawn, with the help of a friend, got the cooler in the waster. I felt bad, but I was oversimulated trying to tie all of our tubes together with rope. Later, I found out Shawn was overwhelmed with everything and had to corral everyone and lead people while I was waiting for that friend, and had to carry my heavy cooler (with drinks we both were sharing).

When we were playing with balls during kayaking, someone accidentally hit Shawn in the eye with a ball, and he was wearing glasses. Shawn was very quiet afterwards, and ended up leaving early.

57,1e8txve,AITA for telling her to stop spending $45 on burgers weekly?,"My (M42) SIL (33) recently started selling burgers on Saturdays. She works a 9-5 Mon-Fri office job with a good salary, but she recently discovered she is pregnant with her ex's baby, he is no longer in the picture, so she is selling burgers for extra income. 

Now, every Saturday my wife (40) buys burgers for our family (3 kids, 12, 10 and 8). My issue is that my SIL sells every burger for $9. So 5 burgers is $45. The burgers are tasty, don't get me wrong, but she is using my MIL recipe, that my wife also knows, so I don't see why we should spend $45 weekly on burgers when my wife can make identical ones at home and we would spend less money on ingredients.

To be clear, technically we can afford SIL's burger comfortably, I just don't see why we should when there are cheaper options

I try to talk about it with my wife and she said she mostly buys because she wants to support her sister. I told her it's not our job to support her sister, beside as I said the burgers are tasty and every weekend they are sold out in a couple of hours, so I don't think losing our 5 burgers would put a dent in her business. 

Yesterday I told my wife  again we shouldn't buy burgers,  and she asked me why I cared if she was buying them from her money, not our money (we have each an accoutn, and one joint account). I told her it's not about that, I just don't think it's sensible to spend $45 every weekend on burgers when she already knows the recipe. She said she will be spending $36 then, because she won't be buying mine anymore if it bothered me so much.

That's exactly what she did, she bought burgers for our kids and her, and didn't buy one for me, which okay, anyway I got a big mac for cheaper. So I thought we were okay, but she has been acting as if she is mad at me since yesterday.

I fail to see why she is mad, AITA?

However as grandparents do, they can give him things that I don’t want him having or tell him things when I’m not around that I don’t want him hearing. Anyway, I have always been super quiet and let a lot of things slide. I never liked confrontation, but as I’m getting older I realise that is only hurting me and my son. For more context we all live together (sep houses but same yard)

So it started last week when my son was told something that I didn’t want him knowing, he even told me my FIL told him that, so I brought it up with my inlaws that I didn’t like that this was said infront of him and he is just a child so he doesn’t need to know this (this is not the first time this has happened but I used to just let it slide), anyway they were like okay, then a few days ago he had a sleep over by them, I have recently been doing a digital detox with him because his behaviour is absolutely terrible when he has a phone or tablet, he cries alot and throws tantrums. So I went to get him in the morning and he is crying, I knew immediately that he had the phone and they took it away when they knew I was coming. So I asked him and he said he was playing a game (which I do not allow at all), so I took off with my MIL and said that he won’t be sleeping by them anymore because he isn’t allowed the phone and I’m not saying he isn’t allowed it because I want him to suffer, I’m saying it because of how he behaves when it gets taken away, I don’t want to see him crying like that. So now my FIL had a talk with me and said that I really hurt my MILs feelings and I need to apologise and they only want the best for him etc. I get that my wording might have been a little harsh but my child was having a tantrum when I specifically said to stop what is causing the tantrum and my wishes were not respected. But now I have to apologise and everyone is acting really off with me as if I did something wrong, maybe my choice of words were wrong but AITA for speaking up for once? Was I actually wrong and I just can’t see it?

Sorry for the long post, I’m just feeling so emotional about this whole thing because I usually never confront things and now I’m trying to be more confrontational but it just seems to be backfiring on me.

Twice a week Sarah makes this hair mask ands she swears it's the thing that makes her hair so healthy. Sarah has told me she wants to make it something people can buy and she thinks it's the ticket out of her corporate job. 

 Sarah has given samples to my sister and has given her a jar like once a month (when she has extras). My sister has begged Sarah for her recipe, and/or wished she would make it for her every week so she can do it as much as Sarah. Sarah said my sister would have to pay for that much (more than what the ingredients are) and she wouldn't give the recipe out. My sister has 4 kids so money is really tight and she can't afford that and my sister cried. 

This is where I might be the AH, I watched Sarah make her recipe and I told my sister how she made it. Everything was fine for weeks and I guess my sister gave the recipe to her friend who posted on TikTok and it went a little viral (500k likes). Sarah saw it and cried and yelled at me. She told me now if she releases anything close to that, it'll seem like she was copying. 

I honestly just wanted to keep the peace because the tension building between my girlfriend and sister was getting thick. 

Now Sarah has been just sending short responses and I feel very conflicted. On one hand I know it was Sarah's recipe but I didn't give it exactly, just what she added and when.

My boyfriend and I drove out to my hometown so I could hang with my family on my bday and we also had some work things to do yesterday. I bought a hotel room by the water for two nights so it could be nice for the two of us. He said he’d pay his half by getting me dinner or something, since he wanted my bday to be nice. I trust him but that plan hasn’t been made yet. 

My boyfriend has fluctuating mental health, and sometimes he can be in bad states at inconvenient times for him. It also affects me because sometimes I’m not always prepared to go into taking care of him mode. Today we have the hotel to ourselves for one day and I wanted to go to the beach since we really only had today. He told me he doesn’t feel good and wanted to rest.

He also tends to be really depressed when I have a special event or occasion in my life.

He also got like this when he met my grandparents, he thought that I cared too much about their opinion of him. I told them that I don’t really care what they think of him, but I want him to at least try and have a good relationship with my family. He said he understood, but sometimes it’s still difficult.

",Not the A-hole,2024-07-21,"AITA for wanting my (20F) BF (22M) to be happier on my birthday? So tomorrow’s my birthday. My boyfriend and I drove out to my hometown so I could hang with my family on my bday and we also had some work things to do yesterday. I bought a hotel room by the water for two nights so it could be nice for the two of us. He said he’d pay his half by getting me dinner or something, since he wanted my bday to be nice. I trust him but that plan hasn’t been made yet. 

My boyfriend has fluctuating mental health, and sometimes he can be in bad states at inconvenient times for him. It also affects me because sometimes I’m not always prepared to go into taking care of him mode. Today we have the hotel to ourselves for one day and I wanted to go to the beach since we really only had today. He told me he doesn’t feel good and wanted to rest.

64,1e8t3c2,AITA for telling off one of my church elders?,"I (f minor) am apart of the Mormon church and am a lesbian. 
Due to being a minor I still gotta go to church, however I am out of the closet to close friends and family. 

While talking to a friend (f minor) at a youth activity, we got on the topic of crushes. I told this friend about this girl I had a crush on at school at the time. Conversation went as expected, just two friends talking about random stuff. I don't remember a good bit of the convo, however I do remember we ended up talking about the church, criticizing how it treats LGBTQA people, esp in the youth. I remember stating ""people can't control who they like and the church really needs to learn that"". When I said this, apparently we were being eaves dropped on by one of the elders (M 40s I think)

He said that being gay was a choice and people who chose to be were wrong. I tried to be respectful and tell him to leave us alone. My friend asked why he was even there talking to us and he said something along the lines of 'i felt the spirit tell me you were speaking ill of the truth' or some shit like that. And that made me loose my temper.

So I got up and yelled at him about the brain washing the church does to its youth, how sadly being gay wasn't a choice, and no one could choose if they like pussy or dick, etc. he obviously didn't listen to me and just told me to hold my tone of some shit, and told me he was telling my parents about my behavior 

My parents scolded me telling me he's a old man and I can't expect him to know better, and that I should respect my elders. I think I was a bit harsh but I don't think I'm the asshole, but I want some outside perspective. So, AITA?

Quick little edit: elder in this case does not refer to yk- elder people. Men in the church over the age of like- 18, as long as they get the endowments, are called elders.

I also notified my husband and friend of the camera.

I realised he had accessed the cameras while I was there, without my knowledge or consent. I immediately caught an attitude and accused him of spying on me. He apologised but explained that my niece (4F) was visiting them and he wanted to show her that we were at his house.

I was livid and immediately messaged my siblings because I wanted discuss the issue with them. My sister had complained about my mum accessing her baby cam when she wasn't baby sitting, so this appeared to be a pattern of behaviour. 

My sister then proceeded to give me a lecture. She implied that I was being an asshole for wanting to scold my dad for using HIS cameras to check HIS house, when l was being given free accomodation. She insisted that I'm overreacting because he had an innocent explanation, and no one saw anything anyway. She also brought up the fact that my parents let my husband and I move in a month ago so we can save money to buy a house.

He apologised but explained that my niece (4F) was visiting them and he wanted to show her that we were at his house.

I was livid and immediately messaged my siblings because I wanted discuss the issue with them. My sister had complained about my mum accessing her baby cam when she wasn't baby sitting, so this appeared to be a pattern of behaviour. 

My sister then proceeded to give me a lecture. She implied that I was being an asshole for wanting to scold my dad for using HIS cameras to check HIS house, when l was being given free accomodation. She insisted that I'm overreacting because he had an innocent explanation, and no one saw anything anyway. She also brought up the fact that my parents let my husband and I move in a month ago so we can save money to buy a house. At first I felt like I was right to feel angry but now I'm starting to second guess myself. I'm wondering if I'm being ungrateful for not wanting to let it slide given all the help they're giving me. I was also rude when I accused my dad of spying on me when I know he's not the kind of person to do that.

71,1e8rws6,AITA for telling my sister-in-law she's no longer welcome in my house after her mother's passing?,"I, (36m), and my wife, (32f), have been together for over ten years, and we've always had issues with her younger sister.

Right after our wedding in April 2012, my sister-in-law was caught stealing $200 from my wife’s purse, which she claimed she was searching for a cigarette (my wife doesn't smoke). She was later caught on camera stealing from a friend's wallet at a house party, causing a scene and leaving without her daughter. When she returned, she made a huge commotion, demanding her child back.

That was when we first cut ties, and I was labeled the A for banning her from our home.

A year later, we moved to a new neighborhood and decided to give her another chance. However, things quickly went downhill with more items going missing. In December 2021, my mother-in-law’s cancer returned, and she passed away in April 2022. During this period, we didn't confront her about the thefts.

Eventually, we discovered that family members also had items missing after every family gathering at our place. They even started locking their purses in their cars to prevent further thefts.

This was the last straw for me. I lost my temper and demanded she leave our house. She made a dramatic exit, causing another scene in front of our new neighbors.

I feel bad for causing family tension and for her kids who suffer because of her actions, but I can't trust her anymore. I’ve offered that her kids can stay, but she can't.

72,1e8rkls,AITA for yelling at my mom because she asked me about my SAT progress?,"Ok so I (16f) am going to be in 11th grade next year. To preface this, I am a super dedicated student, being in a varsity sport, choir president, president of multiple clubs etc. I also have a 4.97/5 GPA. Although I do all these things I also enjoy talking to my friends and hanging out with them. Usually my parents (both immigrants from south Asia) are not too strict with me, because I haven't really done anything to make them not trust me. However, recently, they have become obsessed with my SAT score. I took one towards the middle of sophomore year, and I got a 1330 (700 r&w, 530 math). Because of the 700, I now tutor r&w in schoolhouse. 

I was planning on taking the test again, so my parents signed me up for tutoring. I take tons of practice tests and get hw every day. I haven't really complained too much about this, but of course its annoying and interferes with my work schedule.  They send me articles every day on how to get a 1600 and don't really talk about anything else with me.

Yesterday, I took a practice sat test and got a 1540. Instead of an ""I'm proud of you"" or ""good job"" I got a ""now review the questions and figure out what you did wrong"". My mom then came into my room and and asked about the schedule for the rest of the day. I told her to look at my calendar because I have EVERYTHING written down there. I use my calendar for school planning as well, which was helpful when I took aps. Later I went to a party with my friends while my parents and sister went to a family friend's house. Today, she talked to me for about an hour about the sat and told me how yesterday she asked our family friend about their sat score. Apparently she got 1500s on the practice tests but a 1420 on the real test. (Which isn't even terrible). 

At this point I got super frustrated and blew up on her, asking her to stop micromanaging me. I said she never had to once remind me to do hw for school or remind me to study for my aps (I got a 5 on all of them). I told her how she never talks to me about anything else and that its really frustrating. Now she wont talk to me because I was ""being rude"".

73,1e8rh8a,AITAH for breaking up with my best friend,"I 24f and my best friend 26f have been friends since I was 12 and she was 14. Her and her husband have been trying to have a baby for 2 years now. That’s important because she told me she was gonna be upset if I got pregnant before her. Last year I fell pregnant by my then boyfriend. I broke up with him shortly after but that’s another story. Throughout my pregnancy my bsf suggested I use her SIL as my babysitter as I had voiced multiple times not wanting to put my child in daycare. After reaching out to her SIL I decided that would be the best fit for me. I wanted my bsf to be here for my daughter’s birth and so she was. She took off work and was here for 10 days to help me or so I thought. 4 days post C-section she informs me that she isn’t helping me as much because I need to figure it out on my own since she won’t be here forever. That really hurt me but I tried to look past it because maybe she just couldn’t handle me having a baby like she thought she could.  Fast forward to last month I’m about to take my baby to the babysitters. As I’m loading the baby she texts me informing me that her daughter is sick. Okay thank you for letting me know I’ll call out of work. She then went two days the next week since I had taken off for my birthday. Then the following week she went Monday and Tuesday morning as I’m getting ready for work the babysitter texts me to inform me that she had been passing out and doesn’t feel safe to keep her. Okay thank you for letting me know I’ll find someone else today. I text the babysitter that afternoon to see how she was feeling. She doesn’t respond. So I text her that evening telling her I’ve got someone for tomorrow if she needs to take another day. She says she does. Well the babysitter ended up keeping my baby that Thursday and Friday. And here’s where everything went wrong. The baby sitter texts me Sunday to ask if I can pay her for the past 2 weeks instead of just one week like we had been doing. I inform her that I don’t have it on my card but that I can pay her cash the next morning if that’s fine. She never responded but when I dropped my baby off that Monday I paid her for the past 2 weeks. I pick my baby up that evening and everything seems to be okay. Later that night around 8 I’m feeding my baby to lay her down for the night, the baby sitter texts me to say she’s so sorry for the inconvenience this is going to cause but she can’t watch my baby that entire week. I say okay and ask her at this point if I need to find someone else. I’d prefer to use her but if she’s having some health issues I don’t mind finding someone else as my baby comes first to me and I need to make sure she’s taken care of. She doesn’t respond. I text my bsf voicing my frustrations and letting her know what was going on and telling her that if I don’t go to work I’ll get fired so I was looking for someone else. My bsf tells me I’m being unfair. That hurt me because I give people so many chances but I loved my job and didn’t want to get fired for calling out so many times.  So I text the babysitter  the next day telling her that I needed to come pick up some of my stuff since she wouldn’t be there that week. She informs me that she isn’t home and doesn’t know when she will be home again. Frustrated I say okay. She lets me know the next day that they’re home but will be leaving soon but will leave my stuff where I can get it. After having to drive 45 minutes to get my baby and not getting home until 7:30 which is when my baby goes to bed I didn’t want to drive another 40 minutes to her house and back so I just said forget it and I’ll get it another day. Well I text the babysitter that Sunday letting her know I had someone lined up for Monday since I hadn’t heard from her and asked her if she’d be keeping her any that week. The babysitter never responded. I text the babysitter the next day informing her I’d be coming to get all of my stuff that I had taken over there since she apparently wasn’t keeping my child anymore. After a few days I got on Facebook and realized the baby sitter had deleted me so one thing I didn’t want going around was that I fired her and was being unfair. I text my friend to let her know what was going on and her response was “that’s unfortunate” and here’s where I could be the asshole. Her comment pissed me off so I responded with “Yeah and the fact she wasn’t feeding *baby* properly and starving her is very unfortunate. I’m glad *** stepped up when **** effed me over.”

Bsf:”That’s such a bold and unnecessary thing to say. I’m honestly very disappointed in you. So if you wanna be nasty, take it else where. “

Me:”Wowwww. The fact that she was only giving 2 bottles to her in a 10 hour period is what’s nasty. I never thought you’d be this way. I’m so sad I ever let her keep *** especially for what she was charging me. “

Bsf:”Because did you bring that concern up to her? Probably not. You are making an assumption, she would not starve your baby. 

Did you talk to her about that???? 

What do you mean you never thought I’d be this way? How am I being? “

Me:”I don’t bring a lot of things up but when it comes to *** I do. I asked her to not let her go more than 4 hours without a bottle yet she did. The only time *** goes longer than 3 hours is at night. If I’d let her she’d drink 5 bottles in 8 hours.

Saying I’m being nasty. I knew better than to bring this situation up to you bc I knew you’d defend her and tell me I’m being “unfair” “

Bsf:”Then why did you bring it up! It has nothing to do with me”

Me:”I shouldn’t have I just thought I could voice my frustrations to my best friend but I thought wrong. Never again “

Bsf:”**** is ALSO my best friend. So it’s honestly effed up to put me in the middle and expect me to not give an honest opinion. If you go around spreading rumors about ****, it’s really will change the trajectory of our relationship. If the roles were reversed I would defend you the same.”

Me:”It’s already changed.”
She then “liked” that text and text “noted” and I “liked” that text 

She then text the baby sitter “just so you know, ****(me) is telling people you starved ***” which sent the baby sitter off on me which is funny she could communicate about that but couldn’t tell me she couldn’t keep my baby. I text bsf “That didn’t take long but look at her being an adult and talking to me when she couldn’t talk to me about whether or not she would keep her but thanks for being there for me.”
Bsf:”***, don’t be snarky with me. 

You need to cool off before you text me anymore.” 
And that’s where it ended. The babysitter did text me back to restart the conversation and apologize for how things went and I apologized for telling ONE person she starved my child.

In fact I love hearing people live. Music, laughter, noise, a-ok with me. Over 10 years of being neighbours, zero problems. This spring, my neighbour who has taken up golfing decides to put up a golf net in her back yard. We share a fence and said net is approx 6 feet from fence.

Fast forward next day she moves the net towards the water Still as close but angled different. Not towards our yard. Towards the walking path. Better. Great thank you. I don’t care what direction you put it, just use foam balls. We live too close together. Talked about it again and the answer is NO they will not stop using the real golfballs.

Everyone else in the friend group were having their own problems at the time so what he did was unacceptable in my view. They needed help of their own but he was making sure he was the center of attention. He said it was because he felt his problems weren't valid enough and that he regretted all that was done. I told him we weren't friends anymore and then finished the conversation. 
     Last night me and the friend group were talking about him. His boyfriend felt hurt because he felt like he was used for validation. My friend was there, so we were technically talking smack in front of him. He tried defending himself and then I started to scream at him because his depression and anxiety were a big deal for me. And it was draining everybody. Just for it to turn out he was exaggerating. I'm aware he still had these problems. But so did everyone. 
     I then did what I did expect myself to. I told him that he was right about himself being worthless. Some of his other friends told him that they can't find any good in him anymore. And that they did view him as worthless as well. He started crying and I started yelling at him to stop crying because he wasn't the victim in the situation. Everyone else was yelling about all the things he did wrong and how his depression affected them for the worse. He ran to the bathroom and cried. And then it was over

76,1e8qxhh,"AITA? because I tried to teach my son a lesson not to cheat on exams, but now he is being bullied at school for being a ""cheat""","(I am not from America and English is not my native language)

I will be brief, I am a high school mathematics teacher, my son was in his first year and had become popular among his classmates, he was doing well in my classes and so were his classmates.

One day I asked my son to send a message to his mother about something since she couldn't find my phone, but he was too lazy to do it and asked me to do it myself. I saw that he had a WhatsApp group called ""Exam Answers"" of course, I had to check it out. My son was sending the answers to his classmates for my exams, I have a notebook where I write down the answers and my son discovered it and was taking photos of them without me realizing it.

I was very disappointed so I decided to teach him a lesson, I wrote down all the answers incorrectly, if the students really paid a little attention they would realize that they were terribly wrong, but even so, in the next exam they actually EVERYONE used the wrong answers. At home I ended up telling my son that I discovered what he was doing and I did it to teach him a lesson. Of course I punished him and he and his classmates they had to take summer classes since I gave them a surprise exam and they were very behind.

That was last year and now they are in 2nd year, I am no longer their teacher but now I am worried, after that, all his friends stopped talking to him and they all called him a cheater who made them fail on purpose, now also in the hallways They call him an idiot who must copy in class to pass and constantly call the teachers' attention during exams by saying that my son is cheating, just to annoy him.

I know that my son no longer cheats, since after last year's reprimand I have been very strict with him regarding his studies, but now he has a very cold relationship with me, he has never directly blamed me, but I found out All this recently when a colleague told me how worried she was about my son, I talked to him about this and he said that ""it's not my problem"" we held a parent meeting to try to solve this, but I still don't know how to avoid the bullying. I had good intentions but I think I didn't measure the repercussions he could have on the school, any advice?

Edit: My son is currently 14 years old.

Edit: I don't know if this counts as publicly humiliating him. I changed the answers in my notebook, which I knew I would give to his classmates and when they all failed, they themselves told me that it was my son who gave them those answers trying to get rid of blame , later at home I told my son that I already knew that.

Edit: My wife agrees with the comments, I should have handled things differently, I am going to talk to him and we will start the process to change him schools, he will be a little further away but it seems like the best option, I will also make an appointment with a therapist family and for him, although he has told me that he does not need it

For many topics, we respect that we have different opinions and leave it at that and it can be fun. However, he has certain views that I don't even bother debating him about because he gets heated and can't see both sides . He knows my views about that topic. My dad is the only person I have these ""debates"" with. But my dad has these ""debates"" (especially about that one topic) with people outside the house as well. Yesterday, he went off on my mom's uncle (who we barely see) at a family dinner and wouldn't even let him speak and got very heated. The uncle was being very respectful and the way my dad was acting was rude. When we got home, my mom mentioned that he was taking it too far and I agreed with her. He got mad (can never take any critism about himself) and raised his voice. I snapped at him telling him to lower his voice. He didn't push it any further - usually drops it when I get involved. But he made a comment about how I always fight with him whenever I come home and also blamed my mom for it saying she's starting it and I take her side. I live 2000kms away for graduate school and come home maybe every 2 months. However, I feel like he has become more opinionated and it feels like it's getting worse (although maybe I'm just not used to it anymore). I don't want to just tolerate that and actually speak up about it because it's hurtful to others. But I also think I'm making it worse by getting involved and saying something.

These fights make me want to go back. But I feel guilty for wanting to leave for things like this. He has been so supportive and sacrificed so much to make sure I got everything I wanted. He never even buys a shirt for himself. He doesn't even let me fund my own tuition (I have loans and line of credits that I would prefer to use because I'd feel more financially free). But he always talks about how his only dream has been to get me through school and wants to fund it all because that's how he will feel like he accomplished something. I don't want to take that away from him and I know I'll give it back when I'm earning money. He never uses these things against me either during these fights and never tries to guilt trip me with it.

I also grew up in this city. All my best friends and support system are here and I hate that things like this make me want to come home less because it makes me feel alone. I want them in my life.

78,1e8qkv7,AITA for not wanting wife to hang out with estranged friend and his family?,"I(M26) had a fall-out with a friend recently. I had borrowed them my car as they did not have one, they asked me to help them find something decent. Months go by anytime I found something good, they’d talk about how they didn't have money yet. They had bad credit and they were rebuilding their credit and I told wife they were going to walk into a dealership once they had good credit. After 4 months after, they called me asking for my policy information (I added him as an additional driver) that they were trying to test-drive a car they were looking to buy from a dealer. I’m in shock as that not what we agreed on, but said nothing and gave them. I didn't hear back again so I followed up with him a week after, and after initial small talk, he let me know that he did pick up his new car that day he called.

I pick up my car - (overdue for an oil change and AC not working) the next day and express disappointment not because he went back on our plan on trying to buy from the auction(I understand a dealer has warranty) but just being out of the loop felt blindsiding, and he says “Oh I'm sorry there's no excuse for what I did, I struggle with communication’”, that's the last time we speak, its been like six weeks.

Maybe 3 weeks after I get my car back, my insurance agent called me that he got a call from my friend’s lender about him and his new car being under my policy, how this happened I do not know and understand, so my agent says he’d let them know both car and driver are not on my policy. Obviously if said friend had carried me along, we’d have talked about insurance information somehow and I might have caught that.

We all went out to dinner as planned.  There were 9 of us total and I unfortunately ended up seated next to her at the table.  Wonderful dinner aside from her ignoring everyone equally.

Anyway, I asked her to please pass the ketchup when she was done using it.  She ignored me and set it just out of my reach after she used it.  I asked again, no reaction.  So I reached over her to get it.  She started yelling at me for getting in her personal space!  I told her that I'd asked her twice and she had ignored me both times.  I'd kind of had it at that point. I then added that next time to simply pass the ketchup or don't be upset when someone reaches for it.  She went into complete meltdown mode.

So I (50M) have a sister (48F) who has paranoid schizoprenia, just like our father did (it was the cause of our parents' divorce).

The attic was extremely tiny and boarded up, and there was no possibility of anyone being there.

It feels like she's in denial over her daughter's mental situation because she doesn't want to relive the pain her husband went through. I really should have taken pictures for evidence, but I never thought of it.

89,1e8nneb,AITA for telling my  ex-SIL she can give her niece a parent if she wants but it won't be me?,"My ex destroyed my life 7 years ago. He was cheating on me with multiple women and allowed one of the women in question to steal from us, which set not only him, but me back because it was a substantial amount she got her hands on and to this day the woman is unknown because she gave fake details. We divorced as a result and one of his affair partners during the divorce admitted she was pregnant. From what I now know, the baby was conceived after I filed for divorce. But the mother was someone in his life while we were married.

Ex and I share two children, our son is 11 and our daughter is 10.

He passed away suddenly about 8 months ago. He was the sole parent of his daughter who is 6 currently. Her mother did not want to be in her life, her mother's family were also not in her life. After my ex died his daughter was taken into foster care. She has remained in foster care. I was contacted earlier in the process and asked if I would foster her and raise her with my children. I said no. That was the end.

My ex's sister got in touch with me a month ago. First time in years we communicated, even at ex's funeral no words were exchanged. And we have bad blood. She expected me to stay with her brother, for our children, despite knowing he was sleeping around. I didn't like that. She felt like I ruined my ex's life by leaving. She told me as much. He gave me an STI that I didn't know I had until I went to get checked after finding out about his affairs. 

Ex's sister told me her niece deserved a parent, deserved a family, and I should keep her with her siblings and she told me to cut the half BS. That she knows the reason my kids called her a half sibling is because of me. And I can undo all the bad I did and make things work for all three kids to have a happy home. She repeated over and over again that she felt her niece deserved this and how she's on foster family five already and no family have come forward to take her. I ignored her and ended the call without saying anything.

But she didn't give up and called me again a week ago, from a new number (I blocked her old one) and she was repeating the same crap. I told her she can give her niece a parent if she wants but it won't ever be me. I told her she should want better for her niece than someone who could never love her or want her.

This caused a hysterical reaction. But she told me I'm a heartless bitch who feels okay separating siblings.

Me (19m) and my brother (22m) have a really great bond, we talk about a lot of stuff and that means also the girls we like etc.
Recently the sister of an old friend of ours (22f) reached out to me because she needed some help for a project (keep in mind we lost contacts with both her and her brother because they moved years ago).

The project took a couple of weeks to make and during that time i got to know her better and we kept talking after the project was done.
I also reached out to her brother and have been hanging out with them for a while

Everyone in my family and hers knew she had a huuuuge crush on my brother when we were younger.
After a few years when they moved back here they talked for a bit, but my brother lost interest and they stopped talking after that.
(This was before the project)
 My brother now thinks she likes me because of how much we talk.

She came over last week, it was just us and we had a great time catching up and having fun.
We ended up talking about her feelings for my brother.
She says she never understood whether he liked her or not when they talked when she moved back here and wanted to confront him about it but a friend of hers stopped her.
I, for some reason, decided to tell her that she may have a shot with him, but also that she could've avoided the whole thing and go on with her life (I really think she could have a shot with him, me and my brother talked about it once) (all of this with metaphors because idk I'm a weirdo and didn't want to feel like it was my fault for anything if something happened, pos or neg)

I've been having a really nice time with her, but i never wanted to understand whether i liked her romantically or not because i knew that whatever the answer was i would've felt or done something weird, and I didn't want that.

Yesterday i went over to their house to help her brother make a cake, and all three of us hung out for the evening.
She had to walk the dog and asked me if i wanted to tag along. I said sure and she put her shoes on.
It was just us outside, and she said that ever since we talked about my brother she's been more and more convinced on confronting him.

I, like last time, said two opposite things, this time reading some stories from a small book of mine and some more metaphors.

That night tho, i kinda got a better grasp of my feelings and i can safely say that, if things keep going like they are doing now, i could end up liking her.

91,1e8nf3o,AITA for calling out sister and mother during family casual meet up,"Hello everyone! At some point, ma and I had a kind of a cold war because she served my favorite pickle to her guests when I told her not to. This pickle is my fave and my boyfriend from a different country sent the pickle to me (this pickle is only available in his country and not mine). To send the pickle to me (amongst other items in his 'care package'), he spent a lot of effort and money to get the care package to reach me.
This pickle, I share with my father cause he loves them too. My mother likes it but she's not very keen on it. Both me and my father really love it and we would crave for it time to time hence we do our best to consume it wisely, like ration it in some sense.
First strike, morning of same day, she served it to her guest, and I was shocked cause it was supposed to be just for us (fam); it's not that I am selfish or maybe? But I just really wanna have it with my father cause we both love it. She brings out the pickle and I was shocked and I tried to be casual and said 'oh mother, we have other pickles in the pantry. Maybe our guests would like it better since this one is made  differently'. It was my hint for her not to serve that pickle and have another ones in the pantry in order not to appear rude in front of her guests. Which she didn't pay attention to. I let it pass. Now, afternoon of same day, she served it again. This time I was pissed and suddenly raised my voice being like 'ma, I told you already! That pickle is just for me and father cause we both love it and it's hard to get it' and which she replied as 'oh, you did not tell me it's just for you and your dad. You're so selfish'. Then she got pissed. That evening, I felt bad raising my voice and tried my best to make it up to her. It was her who avoided me and ignored me. Later that day, she suddenly became okay and I just went with it.
Then, one time she wants me to change something on her phone. Then the convo of her with my sister popped up while I was changing the setting on her phone. It was then and there that I found out that she basically called me a selfish bitch, ungrateful and no manners. She even mentioned that I have no basic decency after all the effort she spent on raising me without my father's help.
So recently, we had a family meet up, and my sister's husband basically was praising my sister's attitude and how ma might be missing sister too much and feels alone now that sister doesnt visit them more often. To which they both replied saying they call and text daily. And I was like: oh, don't worry, they always talk and they talk bad about me.
To which mother denied and mentioned that they talk about other things. 
I just laughed. My other sisters knew about it since I shared the screenshot of my sister and mother talking shit about me. They kept quiet and cleared the table and basically called off the night. So AITAH for doing it?

Later that day, she suddenly became okay and I just went with it.
Then, one time she wants me to change something on her phone. Then the convo of her with my sister popped up while I was changing the setting on her phone. It was then and there that I found out that she basically called me a selfish bitch, ungrateful and no manners. She even mentioned that I have no basic decency after all the effort she spent on raising me without my father's help.
So recently, we had a family meet up, and my sister's husband basically was praising my sister's attitude and how ma might be missing sister too much and feels alone now that sister doesnt visit them more often. To which they both replied saying they call and text daily. And I was like: oh, don't worry, they always talk and they talk bad about me.
To which mother denied and mentioned that they talk about other things. 
I just laughed. My other sisters knew about it since I shared the screenshot of my sister and mother talking shit about me. They kept quiet and cleared the table and basically called off the night. So AITAH for doing it?

92,1e8n8h4,AITA my sister had a sleepover in my room without my knowledge,"EDIT: I have had an apology from my parents explaining they were in the wrong!

Ok, so I’m going to give a bit of background info quickly.

Me, F 17 live with my stepdad M 42 and mum F 43 and my stepbrother M 17. My stepdad has two other kids who come every other weekend, M 15, F 14. My biological dad, M 43 is absent. 

I have a boyfriend, M 16, who on Friday just got back from Spain for a week. I ask if he can sleep at my house that night. My stepdad gets grumpy saying he doesn’t want my little sister being here when he is round as to not “hear things”. Bear in mind she has walked in on her biological brother multiple times prior. Anyway, my boyfriend now feels extremely unwanted and uncomfortable so I spend the weekend at his.

Sunday rolls around, I come back to mine after my boyfriend goes to work to find my bed completely stripped off all the sheets and my dad in my room rummaging around. Very odd as I usually do all of my own laundry as I’m 17 years old. I go downstairs asking my mum why my bed has been stripped and she says “You’re sister had a friend round, they slept in your room.” And my jaw just drops. I get so mad.

I run upstairs and wait for my dad to leave. Turns out he was unplugging stuff they used and literally nose deep in my bed side table. When he leaves, I say “ Thanks I can have my room back” and push the door shut slightly aggressively I dont want to get shouted at for “damaging a door”.

About 5 mins later I go downstairs to ask my mum about a perscription I got the other day when my mum says, “You’re sister is really upset” and that’s when I lash out. I gave multiple explanations why the action was not ok. I am a 17 year old girl, lots of private and expensive stuff is in my room and they let my sister have a random friend over. Without even messaging me. No text, no call, not even a message explaining whats happening. She could of stole something and I wouldn’t have known because I don’t know this friend. And I was told my reaction was totally unecerssary and how much I have upset my sister.

Thing is, my mum and stepdad are going through patch so she didn’t want to cause more arguments. However, when my mum was telling me off, she wasn’t shouting and I think it’s because she knows they’re in the wrong for not letting me know. How would you feel if someone brought a stranger into your room, where all your stuff is, without asking you first?

AITA for getting mad that my sister brought a friend that I don’t know and had a sleepover in my room without letting me know?

EDIT: As some people are confused with our bedrooms I will give a brief explanation.

Stepdad has 2 baby mommas, one with 2 boys and one with one girl. I am my mums only child.

Stepdads eldest son chose to move to our house when he was 13, he is now 17. When he moved in we have one bedroom spare. That became his room. My step sister would share with me and the two brothers would share.

As the eldest brother grew up, he chose to move into the loft because hes a gamer and was too loud for my parents. This in turn created a spare bedroom. This would be used for the 2 other stepchildren who came over. On weekends all 4 siblings where sleeping, my sister would share with me allowing the brothers to have their own room. THIS WEEKEND when the issue occured, it was only my sister and me in the house (meaning she had the spare room to herself, so my room was not the only option).

93,1e8mwrn,AITA for telling my mom I don’t want to spend my break with her friend’s daughter?,";posted update and clarification in comments!)

I (19F) and my sister (18F) are both going to my mom’s hometown to spend the rest of our break. We met T’s daughter there several months ago. T and my parents are very close, as he basically works for my parents’ farm, so you get the need for a close relationship. Both my sister and I had hung out with T’s daughter, L (14F), but we both agree that the experience was not at all pleasant. My mom insisted on having us entertain L, even though we openly told her that we did not enjoy it. It honestly felt more like babysitting because of her again, but it wasn’t like I disliked L— I just didn’t enjoy having to invest my entire month with her, since she comes over every single day because of her dad. 

My mom then called us both ill-mannered for not wanting to spend time with L. So, we kind of had to. Our interaction with L became more irritating when we found out she had absolutely no care for personal boundaries: we close the doors of our room, she barges inside if it isn’t locked. If it is locked, she tries the knob and knocks repeatedly. We told her to stop and informed her that she had to respect our privacy, but she still did it anyway. We then told our mom, and she didn’t seem to understand our issue with what L is doing. My mom thinks that L just wants to get along with us — but I don’t think she gets that at our age, there isn’t much common ground to find nor would it be a fun experience for us. And she definitely doesn’t think how this situation feels like in the shoes of someone our age, being forced to connect with someone L’s age. I feel like she attributes most of L’s behavior to her age.

And now, this coming break, my mom informed us that she has no way of telling if would come by to our house. Before we scheduled that vacation, we already told her that we wished it would be just us during the entirety of our break. She said yes, but later on, told us that L might come over. I expressed my dislike over this since she already agreed to our plan. Whenever my sister and me would bring this up to my mom, she thinks we’re rude for not wanting to hang out with L, since we were her friends. But as always, this just feels like we’d have to babysit all over again. My mom equally told us she will not kick L out if she ever did come, so said that if we wanted to, we should be the one to tell L to leave. But I already know that doing that would only lead her to label us discourteous. Honestly, as I was writing this, I kind of think like I’m the a-hole for feeling this way, especially if I could be a lot nicer considering L’s age. I just want to make sure if my reaction to this is justified, or if my attitude is just unreasonable to this whole thing. AITA?

94,1e8mpu3,AITA Housewives Sister and Mom Complaining Because I Work Too Much,"Hello,

I recently had a big argument with my mom and sister, both housewives. My sister, who is 29, has never worked and lives off government support (we're in France). I'm 25 and work as a web and software developer, plus I have a night job at a pizzeria.

My typical day involves waking up, eating, and working on development projects for my clients until around 5 PM. Then, I go to the pizzeria until 11 PM. Because of my busy schedule, I can’t always help with house chores, shopping, or cooking from Wednesday to Sunday. My mom and sister, however, are home all day with the kids (it's currently the holidays).

Today, my mom asked me to go to the store and take the laundry to the washhouse. I'm the only one with a car. I told her I couldn’t do it because of my workload but could handle it on Monday or Tuesday when I'm off work. She called me selfish, insulted me, and accused me of not contributing to the house. She even demanded I repay any money she’s given me and threatened not to help me buy a new car.

I explained that my work is demanding, even though it’s computer-based. My mom, who’s 60, doesn't understand the effort it takes. She said she worked more than I ever have and didn’t complain, telling me to just do as she says. This led to a lot of shouting and insults from her.

I'm usually a calm person, but these situations with my mom and sister make me lose my temper, which I hate. My sister said I could spare 15 minutes to take the laundry, but I told her they could handle it since they don’t work. They called me selfish again.

I’m feeling overwhelmed and anxious. I want to succeed in my career, so I work a lot, including nights at the pizzeria, where I often stay until midnight to clean after service. Despite this, my family thinks I’m just lazing around on my computer all day.

Am I the asshole?

Thank you.

Edit : I'm still a young developer, so I don't earn a lot of money from it yet. I'm also still in development school and doing projects to gain experience and earn some extra money. This is why I work at the pizzeria for a steady income, especially during the holidays.

Regarding the money, I don't owe my mom a lot—only about €70 because I misplaced my card one day. Normally, I manage on my own and don't ask for financial help from anyone.

As for the car, my mom offered to help me pay for half of it. I never asked her for assistance; she volunteered to help me out.

While I do try to contribute to the household when I can, my workload during my working days is quite heavy. I take care of my own laundry, food, and clean up after myself. On my days off (Monday and Tuesday), I help out more around the house.

96,1e8mf01,AITA for not ever wanting to spend time with my niece?,"My sister (27F) calls me (24F) at least once a month to ask me to watch my niece (8F) & I can even hear my niece in the background saying “I want to come to your house”. The thing is my niece has autism & ADHD and is very overwhelming to watch.

I’m usually just getting off work when she wants to bring her over & I work 10 to 12 hour days and just want to relax when I get off. So I tell her no & she’ll get upset and say “you never spend any time with her, she’s your only niece and she is constantly asking about you and asking to spend time with you. You never see her and it’s sad” & hearing that does make me feel bad but it still doesn’t make me want to watch her.

I will occasionally have my niece over for a sleepover but it has become very rare recently because every time I have her over, it’s mayhem. Here’s a list if the reasons why:

1.She’s constantly sneaking her snacks and juices out of the kitchen when I tell her she can’t have them.

2.She terrorizes my cat to the point where my cat hides from her under the bed

3.She asks me the same question a million times even after I give her the answer.

4.She always has her iPad at full volume and brightness even though I will constantly take it from her and turn the settings down

5.She is always asking for food even after she’s eaten her meal & she never finishes what  she asks for. She’ll take a few bites and throw it away.

6.She’ll ask to watch tv, I’ll turn on the tv and she’ll ask to color instead 30 seconds later, I’ll give her crayons, and she’ll ask for her iPad 30 seconds after that, I’ll give her her ipad, and she’ll ask to play with her slime 30 seconds later. This cycle goes on the entire time she’s here. 

7.She constantly tries to get in the shower, change her clothes, brush her teeth, and wash her face even though she’s already done all those things for the night. 

8.She has her own phone and so she will facetime the people in her contacts that I don’t know and try to show me to them.

9.She constantly asks “when is mommy coming back? I wanna go home, when is mommy picking me up?” literally right after she gets here up until she leaves the next day.

10.She is ALWAYS sick whenever she comes over. It never fails, she’s always coughing and has a runny nose and I tell her to cover her mouth but she just coughs in my face.

She’s had to stop her ADHD medication because she wasn’t eating on it and would lose weight. :(

I tell my sister that she is just too much of a handful for me to handle but every single time, she’ll say “she’s not like that anymore, she’s grown out of it” or “I told her to be on her best behavior, if she’s not listening call me” and I’ll call her and it’ll help for 5 minutes but as soon as she’s off the phone, my niece’s behavior goes back to normal. 

I feel bad because she is my only niece and I would like to have a relationship with her but I really just don’t like having her around because watching her stresses me out & I don’t know what to do about it.

97,1e8m99z,AITA for when I refused my friend who wanted me to pay for her friend's prom ticket?,"I'm in an argument with a friend over this situation. She thinks I was unreasonable and a bad friend to her over this. I think she was overstepping boundaries.

My group of friends wanted to attend prom together. I've never wanted to attend prom, but I was convinced to go and spending time together is nice. It's $100 per ticket. That's a lot of money to my family, but my parents were fine with it because they wanted me to have this once-in-a-lifetime experience.

The issue was when my friend Jennifer wanted to invite her friend Arthur from another school.

Some backstory is that Jennifer introduced me to Arthur 2 years back. We met in person twice and talked online for a bit, but I stopped being friends with Arthur when I felt he became extremely pushy and borderline creepy after being rejected by me. (Other people have told me I was overreacting a bit so idk). Jennifer is still friends with him and she wanted to invite him to prom because he missed his.

So Jennifer wanted to invite Arthur but someone from our school would need to buy him a ticket. Jennifer told me to buy Arthur's ticket.

I told Jennifer I don't even have $100 so I can't. I pointed out that *she* wanted to invite him to our prom, not anyone else in our friend group. Jennifer suggested that I take my parents' credit card to pay for the ticket because it's not a lot of money and assured me that he would pay me back.

I refused this because it sounded crazy to me but she kept pushing for me to take my parents' money and never answered why she couldn't be the one to sponsor his ticket when she and her family are more well off than me.

Jennifer's stance is that Arthur would have paid me back at prom so I was being unnecessary, creating a problem out of nothing, and a bad friend to her over this.

AITA?

  
Edit:

I wanted to add and clarify that prom already happened, I didn't pay for Arthur's ticket, but I did go. This whole thing came up again now because Jennifer sent me a message about this situation and how I acted poorly and now we're arguing about it. I made this post to see if I was being unreasonable in the situation like Jennifer said.   
  
About what happened at prom: I mainly avoided Jennifer and Arthur. There was a time when some of my friend group, including Jennifer, tried to get me to dance with Arthur but I refused and ended up spending time with other friends. This whole thing caused a rift between me and Jennifer, but I'm still friends with some of the friend group. They let me know that Jennifer and Arthur are now dating, but Jennifer isn't really into him and is just giving him a chance?  
",Not the A-hole,2024-07-21,"AITA for when I refused my friend who wanted me to pay for her friend's prom ticket? I'm in an argument with a friend over this situation. She thinks I was unreasonable and a bad friend to her over this. I think she was overstepping boundaries.

My group of friends wanted to attend prom together. I've never wanted to attend prom, but I was convinced to go and spending time together is nice. It's $100 per ticket. That's a lot of money to my family, but my parents were fine with it because they wanted me to have this once-in-a-lifetime experience.

The issue was when my friend Jennifer wanted to invite her friend Arthur from another school.

98,1e8m505,AITA for telling my (22m) dad (60m) that he ruined my appetite?,"I was eating breakfast that my dad prepared for all of us earlier. He made pretty good food, and he spent about 1.5 to 2 hours cooking, baking, etc. everything. It's meant to be a special meal since I'm home this weekend from work. So this morning my parents, my siblings, and I were eating the breakfast. But my dad's behavior made me uncomfortable. He constantly burps when he eats. Today was no exception, and since he happened to sit directly across me, I smelled his burps the most, and they smelled nasty. The first few times I said stuff like ""are you okay?"" or even ""excuse you"", but he seemed to just ignore me. He also sometimes has chewed up food in his cup (which I can see since the cups are glass). He also does other weird things from time to time, like picking his nose or putting his hand into his shorts. I just tried to let it go and focus on enjoying the breakfast.

But then he was also bragging about my younger sister (18f) who will be going to a prestigious college. He was updating me about all the details of her life and achievements, and saying how I should have worked harder in high school. I went to a decent college, but it's still not as top-tier as the one my sister is going to. He compared my SAT and AP scores, my grades, etc. to hers, and it made me feel really bad. He was also nagging my other sister (16f) to work harder and saying that if she doesn't improve herself then she will end up like me. I did fine in college and I'm doing fine in my job, it's just that I'm not as achieved as her. I felt really bad and ashamed the whole time to the point where I was staring down at my food the whole time, yet my dad didn't seem to notice or care.

Finally, my dad asked me about my personal life. He asked me about my social life and love life, which I don't like telling him about because he's really judgmental and nosy. I said that I don't want to talk about it, which made him really mad. He said that this type of family gathering is very rare because I'm living away, and that he wants to enjoy this time with me. I still said that I prefer to keep those things to myself, and then he started scolding me, in front of my mom and siblings. He said that I'm ruining this family gathering by not engaging on conversation with him, and that I should appreciate how much effort he put into preparing the breakfast. He even accused me of hiding secrets from him. I said that I had enough of him, because he wouldn't stop burping, and he was comparing me to my sister and implying that I'm a failure.

100,1e8lm4j,AITA for telling my mom I'm not responsible for making sure my half sister has enough?,"My parents divorced when I (18m) was 18 months old. My mom cheated on my dad a lot and he found out because she found out she was pregnant and she found out she had an STD at the same time. So I don't remember my parents together and I never longed for us to be a whole family again. My mom was always convinced I did want that, or she wanted to convince me and everyone else that I longed for it because I remember on my weekends at her house it was super crazy. I was at her house one weekend every two months from the age of about 3. My dad had primary custody of me. My mom had my half sister when I was about 2.5 years old. My half sister's dad is unknown. My dad isn't, he took a DNA test and apparently there are 3 or 4 guys who could be. But none of them wanted to do the test to find out.

My mom had so little custody of me for a few reasons. One was she moved to be closer to her parents. The other was because she wasn't able to take care of me and my half sister.

There were times my mom put a lot on my dad to treat my half sister like family and to take responsibility for her. She would try to use me. She'd say ""Op loves his sister too much to see her have less"" or ""Op really wants better for his sister and expects better from you"" and when I'd say I don't, my mom would ignore me but dad would be very quick to move things along because he hated me being exposed to that. I was in therapy from the age of 5 until 12 to help me not get stuck.

I never really saw my half sister as an actual sibling. We're not close. I never missed her when I was with my dad. I didn't ever ask my dad to invite her over or to include her in stuff that we did. But my mom would ask me to ask dad. My mom would tell me how much I missed her or how much I wanted these things. It really made me dislike being around mom.

When I was 17 I stopped going to my mom's entirely and I only really answer 1 in every 5 call from her. I haven't seen or spoken to my half sister in over a year now. My mom told me I should be making more of an effort and she told me I'm grown now and I'm aware that they don't have a lot and I should be trying to make sure my half sister has enough, because I have plenty/so much. I told mom I'm not responsible for doing that. She told me most good people would want to help their siblings.

101,1e8lk8q,AITA for not telling my friend’s girlfriend he’s using her?,"I (F25) have a friend (Dave, M24) who I met at college. 

As long as I’ve known him, Dave’s always been a little too desperate to get a girlfriend. He spent years moaning about wanting a relationship, and after graduation he finally got one - with a F24 named Elle.

Elle was really sweet. I met her a handful of times (we live in different cities so it was only really at birthdays/christmases etc) but she was really nice, and I could tell she was smitten. I thought Dave was too.

But then, about a year in, Dave comes to see me and tells me he doesn’t love Elle anymore and wants to break up. I was sympathetic until he told me he’d felt like this for the last 6 MONTHS and had been too nervous to tell her.

With it being Dave’s first relationship I tried to be understanding, but told him he had to end things ASAP which he actually did (confirmed by her IG stories a few days later).

After that I didn’t really see Dave for a while, until went out for drinks for his birthday. Whilst at the bar, Dave told me that Elle would be joining us, because they were now back together. 

This info absolutely FLOORED me. Dave hadn’t been shy when talking about his problems with her earlier that year, and I didn’t know how anyone could say such shitty things about their ex before making the active decision to get back together.

I said just that, and asked what had changed his mind. His response:

“I still don’t love her, but she’s fine for now. It’s better than being alone,”

I honestly could not believe my ears. To me, it sounded like he was using her as a placeholder until he found somebody better, and when I told him this he didn’t even deny it! 

He just got really defensive, giving a whole speech about not wanting to be by himself. It was basically a bunch of selfish bullshit. 

I was really disgusted, and left before Elle arrived so I wouldn’t have to see her, knowing what I know. Since then, I’ve not seen or spoken to Dave or Elle. It’s been 6 months and from Elle’s IG, they are still together. This entire time I’ve been wondering if I should tell her what’s going on. 

On the one hand, if my partner was using me and was openly telling their friends about it, I would want someone to tell me. But then, I’m not very close with Elle. 

Like I said, I’ve only met her a handful of times - I don’t even know if she’d believe me if I told her the truth. She could think I’m trying to get in the way of their relationship or whatever, I don’t know. To her, I’m her boyfriend’s one female friend, which often comes with a lot of stereotypes and suspicion (none of which are true, I’m gay asf though I’m not sure she fully knows this).

It’s still something I think about daily though, wondering if I’ve made the right call here. So I’m asking you Reddit, AITA for letting this slide? Or should I tell her what I know, despite the fact she might not even believe me? I should note I give no fucks about how this might affect Dave. He’s basically dead to me at this point.

102,1e8lhsg,AITA for telling my friend that she isn't traumatized from somebody else's proposal?,"I (20f) have had three close friends in college, Grace (21f), Matt (21m), and Laura (21f).

Laura really likes using mental health terminology. She explores a lot of labels from those therapist influencers online. She's was told that she has an anxiety disorder and depression but that's the only diagnosis she's been given so far. Recently she's been exploring autism and ADHD.

Matt wanted to propose to Grace. They've been dating for a while. He's been planning the proposal for a couple of weeks and while the proposal was very intimate between the two of them I was very involved in scheduling the after-proposal event at a restaurant. The specifics of that are irrelevant to the story but it was lovely and Grace and Matt seemed really happy.

Laura told us that she didn't want to be involved in planning the proposal because it reminded her of her parents' divorce. She said that she might come to the post-engagement party. Well come the day of the engagement and both Matt and I forget to check in on Laura. I don't think it's Matt's fault at all because he was occupied with far more important things but I feel a bit guilty about not reminding her. She ended up not coming to the party.

The next day she starts posting online some dramatic (for lack of a better word) things about how it was traumatizing to see how little her friends cared about her, and that she'll be updating her followers on her trauma therapy journey. She posts that she's now in a really dark place and she thinks she has PTSD.

For context, I'm pretty sensitive to mentions of trauma and PTSD because I was diagnosed with PTSD by a psychologist in my last year of high school after something that happened in my first. I've felt a lot of guilt and shame around this because I spent a lot of time feeling that the thing that happened wasn't bad enough to count. I sometimes still get nightmares and flashbacks but it's gotten better after therapy. I know that I have my own issues wrapped up regarding the word and it bothers me a lot when people seem to throw the terms around without understanding their weight but I also acknowledge that I can't stop the internet from doing its thing.

I haven't told any of my college friends about this, so Laura doesn't know. At one point she called me and starting explaining how traumatized she is and I finally snapped and said, ""You're not traumatized, stop being dramatic, you just got exactly what you asked for.""

Now I feel guilty because I feel like I was a little harsh, and she's posting online (without my name at least) that one friend that she thought she could rely on to support her is abusive and doesn't understand how being traumatized works. However, I feel like honestly, Laura's being very dramatic about an event that's not about her.

103,1e8leec,AITA for Using Someone Else's Social Security Number at the Casino Because They're in a Lower Tax Bracket?,"Hi Reddit,


I need some objective opinions on a situation I recently found myself in. For context, I'm a 35-year-old individual who enjoys gambling at the casino. Recently, I had a particularly good night and won a significant amount of money. As many of you might know, large winnings are subject to taxes, which can be a bummer.


Now, I have a friend, let's call him Dave (30M), who is in a much lower tax bracket than I am. Dave has always been pretty laid back about financial matters, and always tells me he doesn't mind doing whatever to help a friend out.


So, in my moment of 'genius,' I thought, why not use Dave's social security number to report the winnings? This way, less money goes to taxes and more stays in our pockets. Dave was cool with it when I asked him (or maybe I just assumed he was okay because he didn't seem to care much). Anyway, I went ahead and used his SSN on the tax form.


Fast forward a few weeks, and Dave's starting to freak out because he got some IRS notices about the winnings. Now he's more anxious about it than I expected, and he's saying I should've never involved him in the first place. He's worried it might mess up his financial situation and future tax filings.

When I told a few of my other friends about it, opinions were divided. Some sided with Dave, while others thought it was a smart move.


So Reddit, am I the asshole for using Dave's social security number to reduce tax on my casino winnings?",Asshole,2024-07-21,"AITA for Using Someone Else's Social Security Number at the Casino Because They're in a Lower Tax Bracket? Hi Reddit,


I need some objective opinions on a situation I recently found myself in. For context, I'm a 35-year-old individual who enjoys gambling at the casino. Recently, I had a particularly good night and won a significant amount of money. As many of you might know, large winnings are subject to taxes, which can be a bummer.


Now, I have a friend, let's call him Dave (30M), who is in a much lower tax bracket than I am. Dave has always been pretty laid back about financial matters, and always tells me he doesn't mind doing whatever to help a friend out.


So, in my moment of 'genius,' I thought, why not use Dave's social security number to report the winnings? This way, less money goes to taxes and more stays in our pockets. Dave was cool with it when I asked him (or maybe I just assumed he was okay because he didn't seem to care much). Anyway, I went ahead and used his SSN on the tax form.


Fast forward a few weeks, and Dave's starting to freak out because he got some IRS notices about the winnings. Now he's more anxious about it than I expected, and he's saying I should've never involved him in the first place. He's worried it might mess up his financial situation and future tax filings.

104,1e8ld26,AITA for shouting at my friend to take her antipsychotics,"I 14F have this friend, Sarah 15F, we both have autism but she has an eating disorder and severe depression. She’s never been quiet about these things, or the fact that she tried to end herself a year ago, clearly she’s still struggling and she’s resorting to drink and drugs.

She’s still the cool older friend with dyed hair and piercings that’s pretty smart too so we all look up to her, or at least we did before she started causing trouble for us, getting drunk in school and hurting us and such 

I have it worst, she sits me down to tell me how ugly I am and how autistic I am and such.

I’ve been trying to distance myself from her but she’s been trying to stop that. I thought, well how could it hurt to talk to her? So I walked up to her and our other friend, Jane 14F, and this boy we know Harry 15M, they were drawing on each other when I walked in, Sarah got Jane in the eye and we all wanted to see if Jane’s eyelid was green, she didn’t want to show us so I jokingly picked up a pen and said ‘if you show us I’ll draw on Sarah’. She showed us and I took no more than two steps towards Sarah with the pen raised, she ran away and out of reach, she screamed stop three times, not giving me time to react she came at me, hitting me so hard with the pen that it burst my lip.

The teacher tried to act as though we had both punched each other and told ME that I needed to calm down, not paying any mind to Sarah who had retreated to a chair in the corner, I screamed ‘Tell that psycho that she needs to take her antipsychotics!’ Which I wish I hadn’t said but all of the weight from how cruel she’d been just snapped me.

Later I was told by teachers that I was too scary to be in school and I had to go home. Sarah was also sent home but all my friends refuse to take a side. Instead hanging out with her and saying it’s my fault when I refuse to go near Sarah, Jane has been my main support through this though she believes it’d be mean to stop talking to Sarah",TL;DR,2024-07-21,"AITA for shouting at my friend to take her antipsychotics I 14F have this friend, Sarah 15F, we both have autism but she has an eating disorder and severe depression.

However, recently, he's been very distant, and gone from our home on the weekends or some week days even, for anywhere between 16 OVER 24 hours with not even a text. Which is unusual because it was the exact opposite the whole time I've lived w him up until ~3 months ago. We would text regularly, call sometimes, etc. He let's me know when he leaves or is heading to our house, I do the same. Just casual small stuff, but now it's like.. nothing. For a whole day sometimes. Which scares me because he has a past with substance, alcohol, and ""happy hopping"" with any woman who will let him if you know what I mean (<-He has a gf currently). It was a complete 180 and I've asked if it was something on my end or his or whatever, and we've always been very open, but this time and any time I ask about THIS stuff he zips up. I've asked frequently for him to even shoot 1 text or a thumbs up even, anything so I know he's like... alive and conscious and shit and everytime he just says ""Lost track of time"" or ""slept at a buddies"". Both of those things are untrue bc he'll read my texts and is otherwise very uptight about time, or (not in a mean way) friendless.

106,1e8knzf,AITA for getting my uncle to store some sentimental toys for me so I won't be forced to share any of it with my younger half siblings?,"I (17f) always had this smallish collection of sentimental toys that my dad brought home for me whenever he'd travel for work. There were plushies, figurines of characters I loved, diorama's of worlds from my favorite things, for example I have a Narnia diorama. I had them decorating my room for years. I took them down when my mom gave birth to my 5 year old half sister because she was in my room for a year.

This stuff means so much more to me because my dad died when I was 8. I clung to those memories of him within the toys he brought me and I hated taking them down. But I would rather have them stored and not see them than have something break.

7 or 8 months ago my mom suggested I pick out a little something from my collection and give something to each of my half sister's. She told me it would go a long way to making them feel like I care even though I'm really disinterested in them, and it's true that I am disinterested in them. I told my mom they were too sentimental and special for me to give away like that and the only people who one day might get them are my future kids if they're into any of the stuff I was as a kid. My mom took that badly and she told me that I'm going to get older and maybe one day I'll wish I had allowed myself to love my half siblings instead of being so detached and so territorial of stuff from my dad with them. I told her it could happen. She said I should be proactive and reduce any regret I could feel when that time comes.

After that talk I called up my uncle, my dad's brother, and I asked him if he would take the toys and keep them safe for me. He agreed easily and when my mom and her husband were at work and my half sisters were at preschool I gave him the boxes with those things. He promised he would keep them safe and I've seen them at his house since. So they're safe. But I didn't tell my mom what I did.

My mom brought up the toys several more times since that time and I always kept my answer to no. Then a few days ago she was like where the hell are they after telling me something Lion King for my first half sister would be amazing and my Appa plush would be best for my youngest half sister because she loves cute animals. I told mom I had them safe. She asked what the hell that meant. I said she was really obsessed with me giving something to my half sisters from it and I wasn't taking chances that she would pick something out to give to them behind my back but saying they were from me. So I asked a trusted person to keep them safe. She told me I had no business taking those toys out of the house without permission and she told me I'm basically screaming at everyone that I don't love my half sisters and want nothing to do with them with my actions. She told me she had long ago realized how I felt but she expects me to not show it to the kids. It got really heated and her husband told mom I should be grounded. She said there was no point because I wouldn't learn.

107,1e8kcko,AITA for yelling at some lady on the train because I'm disabled?,"Hey, so I'm (23M) was taking the train back home after the test at uni. Context about me, I have a limp in my left leg due to an injury I got last year at a playground. Context to the injury: was running after my little brother when came to visit my family, he climbed onto some tall playground device and when I tried to chase him I tripped and fell right to my left leg, about 70cm fall, and my leg taking all of my 87kg wights led to braking it in the wrong way to the point even after surgery and constant training to strengthen my leg, I can't stand for more than 10 minutes without a standing cane unless I want to start feeling pain in my left leg.

So the train was pretty full, but I found a chair to sit at, about 12 minutes later some old lady (looked somewhere about 50-60 years old) got next to me and asked if I could give her my seat. I said sorry but couldn't and when I said that she started yelling about how entitled young healthy people like me can't help an old lady like her. Some people started to look at me weirdly and I decided to chanell the same energy as her and yelled back about the fact I'm disabled and can't stand for an hour+ till my stop and even showed my walking cane to show I'm not faking it (BTW, the cane was hiding behind my backpack so people couldn't see it).

Long story short, she looked annoying but people started to look at her weirdly now and she left to the next cabin, I was feeling good about myself but the old man sitting next to me said I could have been nicer about it and he was right, I didn't need to go her level but some part of me is glad I did it to hope I taught her some lesson, or at least hope so.

108,1e8k0od,AITA for asking my mum not to bother my boyfriend? ,"My boyfriend and I have been together for five years since we were 18. In 2020, he moved in with my mum and me because we were inseparable. We went through several job changes, and my mum rented a better living space. She asked us to help with bills, so my boyfriend contributed around £400 a month. However, he often quit jobs, causing friction but my mum was very understanding.

My mum started feeling mentally stressed when my boyfriend neglected household chores. For example, he'd only wash his bowl, leaving other dishes for my mum. This behavior affected her as she saw it as disrespectful. Because in her opinion she was washing his dirty underwear and folding it for him but he went as low as separating dishes.

In 2022, my dad passed away. I spent three months in Australia dealing with inheritance issues, leaving my boyfriend alone with our pets. He felt abandoned and started inappropriate conversations with a co-worker. 
he knew my dad was the most important person in my entire life, and I watched him take his last breath. He emotionally cheated on me whilst I was grieving. We fought over this, and he broke things in our house. Eventually, I suggested he move back to his mum's. He moved out, but we decided to give our relationship another try after a month.
my mum was not in the country when this fight happened so she does not even know about this.

We now live in the countryside in a three-bedroom house with a garden. My mum made it clear she would never live with him again but allowed him to visit. Our house is fully carpeted, leading to a lot of pet fur. My mum hoovers daily and only asks me to hoover my room. My boyfriend has been staying over for a week while I go to work, and he takes care of walking the dog.

Today, he told me he wants to leave in the morning and he knows I want to spend time with him because I finish work early as it’s the weekend.  he said it’s because he hates being told to hoover by my mum. I was shocked because it only takes two minutes. He then admitted he hates my mum and feels he can't say no to her. I decided to tell my mum not to ask him for help to avoid further arguments. But to even that I was not allowed as I would make things awkward if I said so. But I still called her secretly and told her hey it’s my turn since he did it yesterday so let me do it after I get back from the office. (which is a lie because my mom went to work yesterday and he did not Hoover.)

My mum doesn't know that when my boyfriend was paying £400, he accused us of using him, which would devastate her. As our bills were way higher than what he contributed - I feel stuck because I understand my mum’s frustration, but if I defend my mum I’m an unsupportive gf. 

I don’t want to move out because my mum helps a lot with the pets, and we’ve only recently started spending time together after 10 years of me being in boarding school. My mum doesn’t mind my boyfriend visiting if he cleans up after himself, but even that is an issue for him.

I had my own shopping to do, my mom had her own shopping, my dad was shopping for my nan and my uncle had his own shopping to do. We all agreed to just split up and do our own thing. 

We all went our separate ways. Until my uncle came up behind me and started asking me to read certain things for him, or where something was. It was setting off my anxiety and I could feel myself getting really anxious. He kept following me around the shop, asking me things and getting in my way when I was trying to get something.

They haven't spoken to me since and it's been almost 24 hours. I'm not sure if I'm the AH because of how I handled it, but at that point I was so anxious and overstimulated that I just had a meltdown. They dont seem to care that I haven't spoken to them since yesterday. I went and made myself some food last night and neither of them spoke to me. So I've just stayed in my room since then.

I exclaimed I shouldn't have to feel like I was babysitting a 50+ year old, how I couldn't concentrate on my list, how I was having a panic attack. My mom asked why I was having a panic attack but with a tone, so I said I didn't want to talk about it. 

They haven't spoken to me since and it's been almost 24 hours. I'm not sure if I'm the AH because of how I handled it, but at that point I was so anxious and overstimulated that I just had a meltdown. They dont seem to care that I haven't spoken to them since yesterday. I went and made myself some food last night and neither of them spoke to me. So I've just stayed in my room since then. It's always like this in my family though, I'm the black sheep and literally nobody would care if I wasn't here.

111,1e8jd42,AITA for bringing over a girl to our apartment when my housemate had his mom over? ,"Me and my house-mate have a argument and We decided to let reddit decide who's in the right. Please let this fucker know.

I (21M) live with my friend of over 6 year in a 2 bedroom apartment for last 2 years. When we started living together when his parents are over I shouldn't bring any girl over or drink (Basically be a good Christian boy). As I never even talked to a girl at that time and don't drink, I accepted it. It was good till last 6 months. When his mother started coming over like every other week and stayed for a week. 

  
It didn't like and had multiple conversation with him about it. Even tho I didn't had any particular issue with his mum but didn't like an extra person in our apartment at all time. He said, that his parents are kind off over bearing and he can't do much about it and he even talked to her about it but she just doesn't listen. My parent are sometimes like this (but never to this level). So, I kinda let it go as she helped with our cooking too. In hindsight, this was my biggest mistake.

  
Because from last month she's been staying here. Now, I have started going out more and started talking to a girl marry and wanted to invite her over. But as my friend's mother is always there I didn't get time. So, this Friday I said fuck it and invited marry over for Saturday night. because last week my friend also brought home his girlfriend and his mother was okay with it. Well, Today morning when marry was leaving my friend's mother started making a scene and said that we have this house into a brothel and bring over girls every weekend for fucking (Worst part being, both I'm a virgin and invited over marry just for movies). Well, marry didn't like it that much for obvious reasons and left in a hurry, I chased and apologized to her before she got her uber.

  
When I went back to my apartment his mother still yelled at me for doing these non-Christian acts in a Christian household (I'm not even Christian, I'm a Buddhist). And Then my friend also said I'm an asshole for bringing over a girl even when he clearly said his mother doesn't like it.

113,1e8jab6,AITA - For forgetting my 2-year old nephews specialist appointment,"  
\*\*Background Information:\*\*

My sister, who is two years older than me, has moved out and is a stay-at-home mom with her husband and their soon-to-be 2-year-old. I, on the other hand, live with my mother and siblings and work full-time as a teacher. My sister and my mother have a toxic relationship and do not communicate with each other. I usually try to maintain peace between them, but they don't get along. My sister also has a rocky relationship with our other two siblings, with whom she has had several falling-outs. As a result, I am usually the only one who speaks to her daily. She can be very clingy and calls me frequently, about 3-4 times a day, including during my work hours, and makes small digs at me for not answering. Despite this, I enjoy speaking to her and my nephew. I also do most of the babysitting whenever they need it, often at the expense of my weekends.



\*\*Story:\*\*

My sister had informed me multiple times about an important appointment that had been scheduled for months. She and her husband were extremely worried about it, and she was very stressed leading up to it. As a first-time mom, she tends to overthink things. The day before the appointment, she mentioned it again and expressed her worries. I reassured her and hoped everything would be fine. However, on the day of the appointment, I completely forgot to call and ask how it went. 



Although I am on holiday from work, I had a jam-packed week filled with errands. Three days passed, and I noticed she hadn't contacted me, which was unusual. If she doesn't call for a day, I usually give her a ring, but I was very busy. On the third day, I messaged her about a product link, and she responded with, ""I thought you would’ve asked how the appointment went."" I apologized and explained that I had forgotten and asked how it went. Unfortunately, they did not receive the news they were hoping for, and my nephew has to undergo a common surgery. I reassured her again and expressed my hope that they are both okay and that her son will be fine.



\*\*Current Situation:\*\*

Today, my sister called, presumably to wish me a happy birthday for tomorrow. The conversation quickly turned sour when I asked how they were doing. She responded by saying she was very upset with me for not asking about the appointment. She went on a rant about how I could forget and not ask. I remained calm and apologized, insisting that I had genuinely forgotten. She kept going, saying she understood but still couldn't believe I forgot to ask. I responded by saying, ""Look, I don’t like where this conversation is heading. I’m sorry I forgot to ask, but I don’t know what you want me to say. I also have a thousand things on my mind and appointments that nobody ever asks about."" She said something shortly after and then hung up.

My mother (49F) was always depressed, but fortunately she had highs and lows, not only lows. During one of the low periods, me and my sister (23F) went to live with our father (51M). Our father was an AH, so after some years we got back to our mother, that seemed like she healed. For some years we were all happy, but after she had a bad argument with my sister, she just becamed badly depressed again.

During the last years she didn't go to work half the time, and after a while she was fired for not going to work for a veeeery long time (like 2 months, without a medical justification). For the next 2 years, I took care of her and her payments (I live with her so I wasn't just paying for her), but in the meanwhile she just didn't do anything. The house is a mess (and I didn't want to do anything aside from keeping order in my bedroom, because I work and I didn't want to just do everything for her and make her used to not have to do anything for the rest of her life), she's always in the bed reading ebooks, she became very fat and only eats junk food, she has very bad problems on her back and legs, she has no social life (not even with her mother, my grandma), she doesn't even change clothes, change the bed sheets or even wash herself. Our poor dog is shitting inside the house every day, and only because of the smell I clean it, otherwise she would just leave it like that.

Even if I know everything that she's passed, I grew very tired of this, especially seeing her in this miserable state. I tried talking to her about it, and all she said was ""I need some time"", but after 2 years of this, she just became worse, didn't even try to get better. So I decided to tell her that I'm going to search for an apartment to live alone, and after I move I won't support her financially anymore, so she needs to get a job and get in shape.

She started telling me that I can't do that, I can't understand the state she's in (I actually do, I have depression since my parents divorced), and that I can't just leave her to die alone because she's not able to get a job in her current state.

115,1e8irne,AITA for refusing to give my cousin the stuff I won (when she wants it more than me and I’ve always let her have my stuff in the past)?,"Me (19F) and my cousin (15F) have always been very close. Recently, we both entered an online contest for craft supplies. She has been into journaling for a very long time, while I have just recently brought myself a notebook in an attempt to clear my mind and deepen my sense of self. The contest was for a huge pack of stickers and fancy pens, and my cousin has talked endlessly about wanting to win it. I didn’t think about it much: statistically, I believed neither of us was likely to win and I can always buy some journaling supplies. 

The results came out two days ago and to my absolute amazement I am a winner. The craft pack will be delivered next week. My cousin and her family were at our house yesterday for a barbecue, and my mum casually mentioned that I won to my aunt, because she knows they are also an artsy family. My cousin overheard and seemed really excited at first. She asked me if she could have the craft pack because her latest journal is purple themed and there are loads of purple stickers (my journal doesn’t have a theme, so in theory I could use any). 

I thought about it and said I’d like to keep the pack. She has since got very upset and says that, as she is the one with the serious hobby, having put in far more hours of commitment, it isn’t fair of me to keep something I know she really wants. She said she posts about her journals on social media platforms and spends most of her spare cash on stationary supplies, while I have never journaled in the past and usually spend my time in my room reading or on my phone. 

I feel bad that she didn’t win and know she would probably use the craft pack with far more dedication than me. But I’ve suffered from a dissociative disorder for years, which my family wasn’t really able to understand, and am trying to break out of it, so this new journaling hobby is part of me recording my day and understanding my needs instead of just detaching from them. I don’t want to sit around in my room anymore and would like to be a more vocal part of the family. I think my cousin and everyone else have got used to me being passive and expect me to keep acting that way by just handing over the craft pack.

117,1e8igfy,AITA for not paying for merchandise that was purchased without consulting me first?,"I feel that I’m in the right here, but he thinks that he is correct and it’s the logical thing for me to do. He said ask my friends, but I’d rather ask Reddit. 

Background: We’ve been seeing each other since late February. He (M34) will only call me his friend since we are both married. His wife is in another country and I (F43) haven’t seen mine since 2015. I will say that I love him with every fiber of my being. 

About two weeks after we started seeing each other he told me that he ordered some merchandise from his home country and he wanted me to sell it. He paid for the merchandise when he ordered it and he would have to pay the rest upon arrival. I’m a disabled, single mom, but I’m not really struggling financially and I have my own boutique. When he ordered the stuff he had no idea that I already own my own business. He said he ordered it because he got emotional and wanted to help me and my daughter by giving us some work. Again at this point he knew nothing about my business or my finances. He couldn’t even show me what the purses and sandals look like, because he had no clue himself as to what they looked like. 

Weeks went by and the package was held in customs. I told him to refuse the package and send it back, because by then he was experiencing money trouble and couldn’t pay the remainder of the bill. I told him again to refuse the package and just take a loss on the money he already paid. I still have no clue what it is that he brought. He would not refuse the package. He then tells me that it’s only fair that I pay the remainder of the bill, because he bought the stuff to benefit my family. I told him no that I didn’t ask for this and now I have to try and sell this stuff that I don’t even like. I again told him to bundle it back up and send it back to his home country. 

I thought this issue was over, but he brought it up again last night saying that I refused to pay him for my part. I never asked for any of this stuff, but once it arrived I took care of it and uploaded it to my boutique. None of it has sold yet, but I’m sure it will in due time. 

He said that the logical solution is 
for me to pay for “my” portion. I don’t see where this is my problem. I didn’t ask for this and I had no decision on what he ordered. I understand that he did it out of the goodness of his heart, but I didn’t want this. If I had a few thousand dollars just laying around I would probably just pay for it, but I don’t and I shouldn’t be punished because I won’t do it.

I feel that I’m in the right here, but he thinks that he is correct and it’s the logical thing for me to do. He said ask my friends, but I’d rather ask Reddit. 

Background: We’ve been seeing each other since late February. He (M34) will only call me his friend since we are both married. His wife is in another country and I (F43) haven’t seen mine since 2015. I will say that I love him with every fiber of my being. 

About two weeks after we started seeing each other he told me that he ordered some merchandise from his home country and he wanted me to sell it. He paid for the merchandise when he ordered it and he would have to pay the rest upon arrival. I’m a disabled, single mom, but I’m not really struggling financially and I have my own boutique. When he ordered the stuff he had no idea that I already own my own business. He said he ordered it because he got emotional and wanted to help me and my daughter by giving us some work. Again at this point he knew nothing about my business or my finances. He couldn’t even show me what the purses and sandals look like, because he had no clue himself as to what they looked like. 

Weeks went by and the package was held in customs. I told him to refuse the package and send it back, because by then he was experiencing money trouble and couldn’t pay the remainder of the bill. I told him again to refuse the package and just take a loss on the money he already paid. I still have no clue what it is that he brought. He would not refuse the package.

I (23M) started dating my girlfriend (25F) about a 1.5 year ago. At that time she lived with her parents as she WFH and didn't wanted the hassle of living alone. After, we got together she started pushing for us to move together. As, it was first serious relation ship of my life, I was a bit hesitant at first. But I agreed because she said she wanted to move out of her parents house as soon as possible.

  
About 4-5 months, when the job market got better. I had a talk with my girlfriend, that I also want to try for a remote job. Because I want to spend more time with my parents as currently I can only visit them every other month and they are getting old fast. And If it went well, I want her to come with me. Well, it didn't went well would be an understatement. She made it clear, that she won't leave the place she grew up to go in the middle of nowhere. Now, thinking back I should have had a clear conversation that time only but I got cold feet and let it go. Now, recently, One of my college friend reached out with a referral to his remote company and I tried out my luck just out of curiosity as I didn't meet the experience requirement. I got the offer because of my friend.

So, last month. I had a serious conversation with stacy about our future.  And I told her that I would be moving back to my state. And while I would love her to come with me but if she doesn't want we can do long distance. And she made clear that If I go back it would be over for us. And left the house. I tried calling her but she didn't responded. I checked with her brother and found out she was safe and at her parents.

119,1e8hz7v,WIBTA for confronting my mother about her obsessing over my nephew?,"To give some background context, I (28M) have a daughter (4F), my brother (29M) has two children (4F & 8mo/M).

My brother’s 8 month old (lets call him Conor) was born in October 2023 with Down’s syndrome and spent the first 3 months of his life in hospital after suffering multiple cardiac arrests and infections. He has been on the verge of death more than once. It has been absolutely horrific and an incredibly difficult time for us as a family and Conor has thankfully made a full recovery and looking at him now you would never know he’d spent almost half of his life in hospital.

Now, here’s where I need to know if I’d be the AH or not - the experience of almost losing Conor seriously took its toll on my mam’s mental health and she had to leave her job because of how badly her mental health has been impacted.

Since then, she babysits him several times a week, she posts about him to thousands of followers on X (her profile picture and cover photo are of him). She never posts about my daughter or my niece.

No matter what we’re talking about, she will always sway the conversation to talking about him.

My boyfriend picked up a picture of our daughter and was talking about what a nice picture it was, and my mam instantly changed the topic to talk about Conor. Whenever my niece is around, my mam seems to complain about playing with her, or the mess she makes.

I don’t want to sound as if I don’t love Conor. Of course I do, I absolutely worship him and he is such a beautiful little boy, he’s changed our lives in such an amazing way. But I struggle to talk about him, particularly with my mother, because he is *all* she ever talks about.

She never asks about my daughter, she never calls me to speak with her (we live a couple hours away), and every single conversation I, or my boyfriend, ever have with her is always about Conor no matter what.

I just want to know if I would be the AH if I confronted her about this, as it seems pretty clear her protection and constant talking about him is her way of dealing with the trauma of almost losing him. I just don’t want my daughter or my niece to lose out on as much of a relationship as they deserve with their grandmother as a result.

Around 1.5 months ago when I was on a trip we started talking again, and I met him after I came back. Since then, we developed a good bond and hung out together a lot. We did sense some chemistry, I also liked him. There were a few moments which made us think it might turn into something, but I shared what I’ve been going through. After giving things a thought, and upon him saying I should be clear on my end first, I talked to him and said I was okay with giving it a try if this turns into something like us dating while he said he didn’t want to get into anything complicated. This went on for few minutes that day, with me trying to tell him that if we do end up being together, I’ll fight for it but he refused and eventually we went back to our places. 
Since that day he has been avoiding me and I could sense it. He was on a 2w long trip after that, so I let it go. Now that he is back, nothing was like it used to be. 
I tried connecting with him. Now this is where I may have fucked up. I asked him to go for a walk with me while he was feeling low. I really wanted to meet up once so pushed a little while being playful, and he got a bit cold about it so I dropped. I did ask him if everything was fine between us and he said all was good. We met the next day and everything seemed fine. Later I met his friends too, they were nice but since everyone was new for me, I felt a bit awkward.

124,1e8hg4h,WIBTA if I uninvited my cousin to my wedding because she doesn't want to get me a wedding gift?,"My cousin rsvp'd yes to my wedding. We are having 50 people all up, only family and close friends. My fiancé and I have been together a long time and don't need any gifts, so instead of a gift registry we put on our invites that if people felt like they wanted to gift something, a donation to our honeymoon fund would be amazing. 

I messaged my cousin asking if she could do my bridal bouquet for my wedding and what the cost would be. She said she'd be happy to do it and it would cost $360, $320 for the flowers and $40 for her half an hour of time. I said I'd be happy to pay her full cash, or if she'd prefer in lieu of a donation to our honeymoon fund, if she'd want to do the bouquet and I'd just pay the $320 for all of the products. 

This is where things got a bit sour. She said she wasn't planning on donating anything to honeymoon fund because she was saving up for her own vacation next year to Hawaii, and while ""it might not be a honeymoon, it's just as important, especially since I dont have other people donating towards my holiday unlike you"" and because of that, I would need to pay full price for the bouquet. 

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not expecting people to donate to the honeymoon fund, and I'm not expecting them to donate the per plate price we paid for their meal like is sometimes expected, we decided on the cost of the wedding and the guests don't have to foot the bill for that. I know some people won't be able to afford to donate and some will donate a token amount, and if she had of said she isn't donating because she can't afford to, or is struggling, I wouldn't have an issue with that and would probably have offered her help in some way. 

But saying she was not donating a token amount because of her holiday, and the tone of ""because it's just as important as a honeymoon"" and that I have people donating to mine and she doesn't really rubbed me the wrong way. And I'm not expecting anything for free but her not wanting to donate because of her holiday, but then also not wanting to donate half an hour of her time with one bouquet because of her holiday has really annoyed me. Like she doesn't want to donate $20 to my honeymoon, but wants me to pay the $40 for her time for her holiday. And of course typically I'd always pay people for their time, and if this was a few hours work I'd never ask. But just her essentially saying that her holiday and her money is more important has gotten under my skin. It's not about the money but the way she's said everything.

We are having 50 people all up, only family and close friends. My fiancé and I have been together a long time and don't need any gifts, so instead of a gift registry we put on our invites that if people felt like they wanted to gift something, a donation to our honeymoon fund would be amazing. 

I messaged my cousin asking if she could do my bridal bouquet for my wedding and what the cost would be. She said she'd be happy to do it and it would cost $360, $320 for the flowers and $40 for her half an hour of time. I said I'd be happy to pay her full cash, or if she'd prefer in lieu of a donation to our honeymoon fund, if she'd want to do the bouquet and I'd just pay the $320 for all of the products. 

This is where things got a bit sour. She said she wasn't planning on donating anything to honeymoon fund because she was saving up for her own vacation next year to Hawaii, and while ""it might not be a honeymoon, it's just as important, especially since I dont have other people donating towards my holiday unlike you"" and because of that, I would need to pay full price for the bouquet. 

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not expecting people to donate to the honeymoon fund, and I'm not expecting them to donate the per plate price we paid for their meal like is sometimes expected, we decided on the cost of the wedding and the guests don't have to foot the bill for that. I know some people won't be able to afford to donate and some will donate a token amount, and if she had of said she isn't donating because she can't afford to, or is struggling, I wouldn't have an issue with that and would probably have offered her help in some way. 

But saying she was not donating a token amount because of her holiday, and the tone of ""because it's just as important as a honeymoon"" and that I have people donating to mine and she doesn't really rubbed me the wrong way. And I'm not expecting anything for free but her not wanting to donate because of her holiday, but then also not wanting to donate half an hour of her time with one bouquet because of her holiday has really annoyed me. Like she doesn't want to donate $20 to my honeymoon, but wants me to pay the $40 for her time for her holiday. And of course typically I'd always pay people for their time, and if this was a few hours work I'd never ask. But just her essentially saying that her holiday and her money is more important has gotten under my skin. It's not about the money but the way she's said everything. 

Reddit, would I be the asshole if I uninvited her?

126,1e8grgb,AITA for dropping this friend?,"Hello,

A few hours ago, I ended my friendship with someone I’ll refer to as Alex. The situation stems from a mutual friend, Carl, who decided to cut ties with me because his girlfriend was uncomfortable with our friendship ( since I’m a girl) Instead of addressing the issue directly (by messaging me himself), Alex ended our friendship by message on Carl’s behalf.

I found this approach quite childish and petty. The message I received mentioned that Carl’s girlfriend had been uncomfortable for some time. If that was the case, and if Carl and alex knew the girl was uncomfortable, why did Carl continue to message me and invite me to events? So to then mention in the message that the girlfriend didn’t like how I went to the party, It seemed inconsistent and unfair.

Given this context, I decided to end my friendship with Alex as well. If Alex was aware of the discomfort, why continue to include me in social gatherings with Carl. Furthermore, I didn’t need a formal message to end the friendship—Carl could have simply stopped responding, as Carl often did. I was never close to Carl, though we had good memories, and I barely messaged him, so I feel really hurt to have gotten that long message. It made me feel disposable and hurt. Also, I’ve never had any romantic desires for both Alex and Carl, they were just friends.

I’m still waiting for a response from Alex and can’t help but feel a bit guilty.  I feel guilty because Alex didn’t do anything wrong other than that, and he was a good friend. Am I a bad person for throwing it all away, I don’t want alex to feel sad but I gotta move on. I felt really disrespected. Was my decision to end the friendship with Alex justified? Am I the asshole

This happened on a popular game called VRChat. I, a (17 f) , met this girl named Max, also (17 f) , in a virtual world. We started to hit it off immediately, sharing similar interests and having great conversations. After a few hours of getting to know each other, we realized we had become great friends. During this time, Max's VRChat daughter, a (12 f) , joined us, and I quickly became friends with her as well. We all decided to join a friend+ world to talk more freely and play some games together. After an hour of playing games and enjoying ourselves, one of Max's friends, named Storm, joined us. I don’t know his age, but he’s a male. He walked over to our group as we were chatting and suddenly started hitting us.

Max and I started a conversation about our backgrounds, and I mentioned that I came from Asia.

We told him to stop, warning him that if he continued, we would kick him out and block him. Honestly, his comments didn't affected me, as I've heard them before.

128,1e8ghgs,AITA for not giving my brother a ride?,"Me(30f) and my brother(35m) have  a very long and complicated history.  When we were kids, I literally worshipped him and he was my best friend. But we were separated pretty early in life, and I believe he blames me for that. 

Fast forward, he has been really selfish and manipulative to the family our whole life. He always manages to get what he wants from them and then disappears for years when he has gotten it. 

I have always tried my hardest to keep in contact and he keeps me at arms length all the time. He has done awful things to me,b u t have never wavered in my hope that we could find our way back to one another.  

Lately, he has been really trying to be a part of the family again. He has made apologies for being absent for the last 6 years to everyone in the family, except for me. They've all forgiven him and accepted him right back In without a second thought.  


When he does this, I suddenly become invisible to the family. He is the salt of the earth and I'm just... here. The older we get, the more resentful I feel about it. I've always consistently maintained relationships with them, and he just f*cks right off whenever he wants. 


Anyway, he can't drive and I was asked to give him a ride to a family event. The way I was asked left very little room for me to say no. It became my obligation to get him to the event (fairly common in our life) even though it is 40 miles out of my way. It adds a whole hour to an already 2.5 hrs drive. 

Despite feeling terribly guilty, I said no. If he really wanted to be there, he should be able to do it himself, right? But now I'm worried that he won't show up and people will blame me for it. This could impact his decision to keep trying and cause him to bail on the family again. 

But I feel like I shouldn't have to deliver my brother to my family in order for him to put in effort. Nor do I feel like it's fair for me to feel guilty the whole time if he doesn't show up, but invisible if he does.

I don’t own a dog myself although I love animals. It’s because of my discomfort with hygiene and not having enough time. I believe animals should be raised in a home where the owners can meet their needs and make them comfortable which is why I don’t own a pet myself.

He also said some other bad words before leaving my door and kept yelling and shouting for half an hour even after he left. 
The thing is I know he didn’t have anyone to watch the dogs which his why he came to my door in the first place. Now I feel like the asshole because he might blame the dogs for not being able to go somewhere or he might leave them alone??? So AITA?",0.0,0.09395164251327515,0,1
133,1e8fwz2,AITA - Girlfriend ranting about work for an hour and a half almost every day.,"Hi everyone, 

AITA in this situation? 

My girlfriend works in a nursery with quite catty people, they'll smile to eachothers faces and then have a lot to say when one of them leaves the room. 
They're also habitually lazy, doing the bare minimum while my girlfriend runs around doing her job, and half of theirs. 

I understand this must be frustrating, but I get a phone call once she has finished work and I'm forced into listening to an hour and a half of ranting about every detail that happened that day. It's quite literally a transcript, which goes something like this: 
""Suzy said this, and then Tara said that, then Suzy said this, and Brenda agreed, so Tara got upset and asked Lisa, who disagreed with everyone"" - I'm literally getting 8 hours worth of back and forth conversation thrown at me. 
If I try to offer advise, or comment, I get spoken over, so I feel like I'm being held verbal hostage for the entirety of this 'conversation'. 

I've advised her that if work makes her this unhappy and stressed that she should be looking for alternate employment, because it's clearly having a negative impact on her mental wellbeing. 
I've also provided her several different ways to communicate her frustrations, which don't include an hour and a half being ranted at after I've just finished work, and I'm cooking for both of us. 

I know this comes across insensitive, or I feel it does, but I work a very mentally demanding job as a software developer and I'm always working to tight, borderline unachievable deadlines, so I often don't have the mental capacity to listen to all of this straight after work. 

AITA, because I have some major cognitive dissonance going on here. I want to support her, and for her to feel her voice, frustrations, and emotions are being heard - But I often don't feel like she care about this, she just wants someone to rant at who isn't allowed to speak in return... As well as not factoring in that I can be quite mentally drained, and this proving detrimental to both of us. 
She previously said she'd stop talking about work all together, which I felt was a bit manipulative, given she knows I'd always go out of my way to help anyone who needs it, but right now I feel like I need some help from her in order for me to be able to help her? Surely it can't just be a one way dynamic? ",No A-holes here,2024-07-21,"AITA - Girlfriend ranting about work for an hour and a half almost every day. Hi everyone,

136,1e8et0j,AITA for telling my mom’s bf that he’s not my dad?  ,"I 25F have two siblings 19m and 15f. I don’t have a close relationship with my mom’s bf since part of the reason my parents divorced was because I caught my mom cheating with her current boyfriend. This happened 8 years ago and I’ve kept it civil with him. 
On to the next part, my bro got a dog in the beginning of the year. He had a hard time training him since he went from being an outdoor dog to an indoor dog so he would have a lot of accidents at the beginning. He also has a specific diet since he has a sensitive stomach so my brother’s gf helps make his food. My mom’s bf took it upon himself to start feeding him an extra meal every night which has caused him to gain weight. My bro and his gf have asked him to stop over feeding him bc he’s already overweight. He dismisses them saying it’s fine and that they’re overreacting. Now he started to “discipline” him. They have another small dog and my mom’s bf “disciplines” him too. He doesn’t see the issue with this bc in his words “that’s how they learn”. 

Last night, I was in the living room at my mom’s house with my sister. My mom’s bf went into my bro’s room to get the dog to walk him since my bro wasn’t home. The dog was excited jumping up and down while being on the leash and my mom’s bf started yelling at him to stop. The dog didn’t stop so my mom’s bf ended up “disciplining” him on his nape twice and it was so rough the dog went on his belly and stayed down. I was sitting on the couch and watched it all happen and said to not do that and why is he doing it he said “bc he needs to learn that’s why he acts like this” I said that’s not the way to discipline a dog and said it’s ab***. He argued that it isn’t ab*** and I told him that it is. He then threw the leash at me and said “fine then you take him”. Had they told me to take the dog out I would’ve, but it wasn’t even the time that my brother walks him and the dog wasn’t barking or anything (we constantly checked up on him). He started yelling at me telling me that the dog shouldn’t be here since he never gave permission (he did) and I started laughing bc he has a tendency to gaslight. He kept shouting and I told him to not raise his voice at me since he’s not my dad to speak to me that way. 

While all of this was happening my mom was sitting in the patio a couple of feet away and she didn’t say anything except that her bf didn’t hit the dog (both my sister and I saw). 

Later that night I got into it with my mom and she accused me of not wanting to see her happy and I want her to be miserable with my dad (my dad was ab***ve to all of us and she enabled him). I’ve never said anything like that to her, and I just told her she’s a poor excuse of a mother. 

Anyways both her and her bf are now saying that he never “disciplined” the dog, he didn’t raise his voice at me and that he knows he’s not my dad so that comment was unnecessary. So now I’m thinking I’m in the wrong for saying anything in the first place, so AITA?

137,1e8esjv,AITA for being frustrated with my autistic brother?,"So, I'm not comfortable sharing my, or my brother's age here and I hope that's okay, but I really need to know.

My brother is autistic (don't know what level officially), and I know things can be harder for people, and I've done my best to be understanding, but lately it feels like he can't do *anything*.

He doesn't do his school, he hardly helps me clean when my parents ask, and if he does he just picks something up and plays with it until I have to remind him to throw/put it away. He won't move things that can easily be moved to make things fit on the shelf. He just has a hard time helping or doing anything productive.

But I know he can do things! It's just the only things he ever does is play the fucking x-box, play with Transformers, and whatever else he hyperfixates on, which would be fine, if he just actually helped me sometimes. He can move things whenever it's something he enjoys, but whenever it's something that need to be done or else everyone is in trouble, it's suddenly hard?

He's doesn't have high support needs, he talks just fine, and I know it can be different for everyone, I know it can be hard, but I'm just so tired of having to help him put stuff in the fridge.

He went to therapy for years, almost ever since I can remember, and was only taken out like, one year ago. He's old enough to know what to do, I know he knows what to do, he just doesn't.

My parents do hardly anything about this, I mean . . . I don't want him to get in too much trouble, but like, at least a little more then a talking to? Then another warning?

I feel like most of the time I bring this up it's just another slightly different version of ""things are just a bit harder for your brother"" and I get that, but just for once, can't he put a few things on the shelf without me having to give him a step by step guide? If I don't he just stands there, and then half the time when I do try and give him advice he gets frustrated. He's over 13 and I feel like I'm helping a 3 year old. It's gotten to the point where I just do almost all the stuff myself while he plays whatever video game he's focused on.

I love him, I swear I do, but I'm getting so tired of this. Almost my whole life, I don't want to have to help him so much anymore.

But I feel like an asshole because maybe I'm not being understanding enough. I don't know what it's like for him, it probably really is hard, and I will admit, sometimes I snap and yell, but I'm just so tired of this.

For added context — there is a large table next to the dryers that people commonly move clothing to in situations like this.

140,1e8ejcf,AITA for refusing to help my brother after his wife blabbed about my financial situation?,"A few years ago I won a lottery and became set for many lives over. Even though my name and winnings were public records, I worked hard to keep it a secret. For the most part it worked. After verifying my winnings and setting up a trust, I told my family. 

My plan was to basically help each of my three brothers and my parents depending on their needs. My brother Chris and his wife Alice had three kids and I offered to pay for a down payment on a house they wanted. As crazy as it sounds, I was more broke the first year of winning than the year before I won because I was helping my family out.

I had one rule for anyone who took money from me - don't tell anyone about my money. Well Chris and Alice did for clout and that unleashed a lot of people bombarding me with money requests. These were friends of theirs, friends of friends of theirs, in-laws, etc. Like my brother's BIL asked me to pay for a wedding in St Lucia because his fiancée wanted one and I met the guy twice in nine years. Though this happened in 2021, people still bother me constantly for money.

I was pissed and cut my brother off. This led to a rift in the family and I largely became estranged from them. It was unfortunate because I was very close to my nephews and wanted to spoil them. 

Last week my other brother emailed me and said Chris has been sick all year and is bed ridden and gets specialized care. Something to do with breathing. I said that was sad. He said that Chris and Alice were going to lose the house because Chris hasn't been working. They have four kids from age 4 to 15. I told him if he had something to say, then say it. He asked me if I'd help them out by paying their outstanding bills and until they can get back on their feet. 

I said no. The money isn't the issue. It's my privacy. I have no idea if they will keep their mouths shut about my helping them. I get painted as a ""nice rich guy"" and then I have 10 people bothering me with their problems. You help them once, they'll keep on coming back. It's very funny how people just happen to have financial emergencies when you're helping others out. 

The other problem is that of my brother does pass, then I don't want Alice getting a house that I paid 20% of. She and I don't get along and she's the one who put my business out there. She was so certain that I'd take care of them that she didn't even bother to say ""thanks for the down payment on our dream house!"" 

How bad is their financial situation? Bad. I'd offer to help in other ways but beggars want to be choosers and negotiate their charity.

Edit: I am not setting up some sort of loan settlement with my brother and his wife. They don't have the means to pay me back and would see it as a sign of weakness. Ironically the only other person who is against giving them money is my financial advisor.

Sorry, I gave them $420,000 to buy a house and they managed to fuck that up. They live in a nicer house than I do. I don't live fancy. I don't own a Rolex and my clothes have holes in them. I bought my furniture from Big Lots.

My other reason for not helping is that I know for a fact that his wife wouldn't help me if the roles were reversed and would be less nice about it. I love my nephews but I'm won't be blackmailed over them. When they come of age and reach out to me then I'll be there for them.

My plan was to basically help each of my three brothers and my parents depending on their needs. My brother Chris and his wife Alice had three kids and I offered to pay for a down payment on a house they wanted. As crazy as it sounds, I was more broke the first year of winning than the year before I won because I was helping my family out.

I had one rule for anyone who took money from me - don't tell anyone about my money. Well Chris and Alice did for clout and that unleashed a lot of people bombarding me with money requests. These were friends of theirs, friends of friends of theirs, in-laws, etc. Like my brother's BIL asked me to pay for a wedding in St Lucia because his fiancée wanted one and I met the guy twice in nine years. Though this happened in 2021, people still bother me constantly for money.

I was pissed and cut my brother off. This led to a rift in the family and I largely became estranged from them. It was unfortunate because I was very close to my nephews and wanted to spoil them. 

Last week my other brother emailed me and said Chris has been sick all year and is bed ridden and gets specialized care. Something to do with breathing. I said that was sad. He said that Chris and Alice were going to lose the house because Chris hasn't been working. They have four kids from age 4 to 15. I told him if he had something to say, then say it. He asked me if I'd help them out by paying their outstanding bills and until they can get back on their feet. 

I said no. The money isn't the issue. It's my privacy. I have no idea if they will keep their mouths shut about my helping them. I get painted as a ""nice rich guy"" and then I have 10 people bothering me with their problems. You help them once, they'll keep on coming back. It's very funny how people just happen to have financial emergencies when you're helping others out. 

The other problem is that of my brother does pass, then I don't want Alice getting a house that I paid 20% of. She and I don't get along and she's the one who put my business out there. She was so certain that I'd take care of them that she didn't even bother to say ""thanks for the down payment on our dream house!"" 

How bad is their financial situation? Bad. I'd offer to help in other ways but beggars want to be choosers and negotiate their charity.

Edit: I am not setting up some sort of loan settlement with my brother and his wife. They don't have the means to pay me back and would see it as a sign of weakness. Ironically the only other person who is against giving them money is my financial advisor.

Sorry, I gave them $420,000 to buy a house and they managed to fuck that up. They live in a nicer house than I do. I don't live fancy. I don't own a Rolex and my clothes have holes in them. I bought my furniture from Big Lots.

My other reason for not helping is that I know for a fact that his wife wouldn't help me if the roles were reversed and would be less nice about it. I love my nephews but I'm won't be blackmailed over them. When they come of age and reach out to me then I'll be there for them. ",0.0,0.0785280093550682,0,1

142,1e8ecbn,AITA for apologizing to my ex's gf who's jealous of me?,"I know the title may seem confusing, so I'll get straight into the main point. I  met my THEN boyfriend (lets call him jake) 2 years ago in 2022. We were young and each other's first love, but ended up breaking up because of certain circumstances. 

Fast forward to a year later, I had a new partner (Joseph) while Jake was single at the time. Earlier last year, Jake and I got into a fight which caused a strain in our friendship during the time when my relationship with Joseph just started. After a few months, we finally worked it out and we became good friends. When Joseph found out (because I told him) he seemed bothered by it, and we ended up having a few arguments and I just ended up becoming distant from Jake again. 

My relationship with Joseph became very on and off after that, and everytime we ended things, Jake was always there for me and comforted me which led him to becoming someone very important in my life. 

Now, in 2024, I finally broke up with Joseph after learning he cheated on me and Jake has a new gf (lets call her sam). Jake and Sam have been talking since February, and I've known about it and am very supportive. Late May was the first time I met her in person and I thought that we would become good friends. Last month, I went out with my friends (Jake included) and it was all fun, but Jake seemed to be ignoring me which I found odd but didnt say anything. I later learned that he acted that way because Sam had underlying jealousy towards me because she learned about my past with Jake.

I felt a bit sad, but I kept my mouth shut as to not make any drama. Fast forward to a month later, Jake was going to have his birthday, and it has been tradition that we spend his birthday with each other and all our other friends, however this year, i learned that Sam asked not to invite me which made me upset, but I kept my mouth shut once again. After his birthday passed, I ranted to my friends about it to which they dismissed it and told me that I should be understanding, and I felt my feelings were invalidated. After that, I learned that not only Sam was not comfortable with me, but Jake as well. After learning this, I cried because I felt like I was just being seen as an ex when I thought that we could all be friends, as we agreed mutually that we would remain friends.

After learning this, I decided to distance myself from Jake and Sam and all their friends, but before doing so, I decided to talk to Sam and apologize for any discomfort I gave them.

144,1e8dyls,AITA for leaving the trip early after my long distance bf invited other people on our trip ,"

I (29f) and my bf (24m) have been in a long distance relationship for about 7 months now, in the 7 months we’ve been together we’ve hung out a total of 3 times (3-5 days of him visiting me or me visiting). This week was my 2nd time going to visit him in his city which is a 5 hour flight. It’s both of our birthdays and he wanted to go camping which I was already hesitant about as I’ve never been camping before and I have IBS so I wanted to do 2 nights and he wanted to do 4. So we did 4. The first 2 days were amazing and then I immediately mentally checked out by the 3rd day, I knew my limit was 2 days and by the third day I was dissociated and overstimulated and drained and just wanted to be in my own bed. On the third day he told me that his friend is joining us, we waited for his friend for 5 hours and he finally arrived at 12 am and brought a girl with him. I was not in the mood to socialize or interact with anyone and my social anxiety was spiraling knowing I have no exit and can’t just go home if I’m not having a good time, so after having enough drinks to tolerate hanging out with them for the night, I decided to leave to a hotel for the remaining day of my trip so I apologized for having to cut the trip short and went to a hotel, but had a full nights sleep, ate properly for the first time in days and took a shower and then my flight was the day after. My bf is upset that I was “rude” and unwelcoming to the guests, who I didn’t even know were joining us, specially the girl who I’ve never met before (my bf has met her maybe like a total of 2 times) I told him I was socially drained and wouldn’t be able to function in a group setting and I did what was best for me. I also told him I went to see HIM, not go on an overnight double date. Now he’s telling me that with that attitude, he will never want to introduce me to any of his friends ever again. Am I the asshole?

145,1e8dv9r,AITA for not giving up my half of my inheritance from my mother because my sister who's a single mom of a profoundly disabled child and needs money more? ,"(Note: I'm not in the US so American laws don't apply here).

My (30/F) mother (63/F) passed away a couple of months ago following a sudden & unexpected cardiac arrest. She owned a very nice home outright & had a fairly significant amount of savings as both her & my father's retirement savings were in her bank account (my father died 8 years ago at 59 from cancer).

My sister ""Meghan"" (34/F) is a single mother to two sons aged 7 & 5, both of whom have autism, with the youngest being profoundly autistic & will require round the clock care for life. She doesn't work & is reliant on carer payments from the government & child support. Her now ex husband divorced her because he couldn't ""deal with"" his sons, moved to another country (dual citizen) where it's hard for the government get child support because their government is difficult to work with.

My mother's will divided her jewellery equally between us & that the rest of her estate should be split equally between us. 

Meghan is pressuring me into just taking the jewellery left to me & letting her have both the house & the money because ""I need it more because of the boys. You're fine & can work"".

I want my share & said I won't be giving it up.

I'm childless & don't plan to have children. I work in legal for a non profit, & while I am far from ""balling"" in this economy, I'm able to pay my bills without financial stress. My fiancee is foreign born (I met her overseas at a concert in early 2018 & we've been going back/forward as much as we can ever since, remote work helps a lot) & we are in the process of securing her permanent residency on a partner visa here which is an expensive & time consuming process.

Receiving my share will wipe out what's left of my student debt, allow me to take time off work to get her Visa sorted faster & buy us a small but still nice house outright so we can live without the stress of a mortgage. Not having a mortgage will afford us the ability to live comfortably but not extravagantly, take a holiday every year, & be free of financial stress. It will also pay for a small but nice wedding & to fly her parents & sister out for it.

Meghan is furious, saying it's selfish & I can always get a better job if I want a better life & at least I can work & that I need to have sympathy for her situation.

I don't want to give up work I am passionate about & that gives me good work life balance to go work 14 hour days in Big Law downtown to service a mortgage.

147,1e8dqrl,AITA for asking the condo board to talk to my neighbors about noise?,"I live in a townhouse condo complex. Around 4 this afternoon, my next door neighbors started having a party in the common area behind out building with really loud music. I tried to ignore it, but when 4 hours had passed and I heard their guests scream-singing over my television, i texted the president if the condo board to ask if anyone could go ask them to turn it down a bit. I didn't get a response, but about an hour later the music stopped abruptly. 

We share a front porch which runs under my living room window, so a few minutes later I saw their guests starting to leave and i heard the woman who lives next door speaking angrily, although i couldn't hear words, just tone. Another few minutes passed, more people were leaving and i heard the woman say ""fucking bitch"" and gesture towards my window - I pulled up the footage from my video doorbell and saw that she gave me the middle finger. I reviewed some of the other footage and saw that she continued to call me a ""fucking bitch"", a ""boring-ass basic bitch,"" and other names.

I think i might be the asshole for contacting the board rather than approaching her directly.  I would have approached her myself but I've had issues with her in the past - last fall i asked her to please be more conscientious when shutting her front door after 10p and before 7a since the porch is under my bedroom window, and she started slamming it harder and more frequently. I'm also not sure if the board member told her or was me or if she assumed - there are at least 4 other units in our complex that would have been impacted, plus we're back to back with a different townhouse complex and they would have heard it too. Also i get that it was only 8 when i contacted the board but we literally have rules about noise in common areas or noise that disrupts other units.

Adding this since it came up in the comments.  My municipality's noise laws are in effect 10p-7a during the week and 11p-7a on weekends.  However, our community association has rules that read

148,1e8dq6m,AITA for telling people I don’t want to talk about certain subjects in the middle of conversation? ,"Sometimes when I’m having conversations with people, a conversation might be escalating and I’ll tell people I don’t want to talk about this anymore. Or there might be a subject that someone brings up, and I’ll tell someone I don’t want to talk about that subject. 

I’ve had a few situations and one recently, where I tell people in the middle of conversation, I don’t want to talk about something anymore, because it’s escalating too much, or I don’t want to talk about a topic because I’m uncomfortable with it for whatever reason. 

During these situations, people have almost always kept talking about something, or told me “no, that I don’t get to end the conversation”, and it almost always ends up in some very very heated arguments. 

Am I allowed to tell people I don’t want to talk about a subject anymore, in the middle of conversation, and that I would like them to stop talking to me about something? 

The arguments have been so heated, and people usually keep talking to me, that I’m wondering if AITA? 

One time, someone started talking to me about something very sexual that I didn’t want to talk about, and they kept talking to me after I told them to stop, and it lead to a heated argument.

Recently, i didnt agree with something someone was saying, and in the middle of it getting heated, i said please stop talking to me about this. They declined and it got extremely heated as well. 

Another recent time, someone screamed at me to do something while I was about to get hit by a crazy driver. I admittedly told them to shut the F up, as it was just my first reaction to it. They started arguing with me that I needed to apologize, and I told them I thought what they did was wrong first. They kept arguing with me, until I just said in the middle of the conversation, to please stop talking to me about it, as I felt the conversation/argument was going nowhere. And just getting more heated 

Is it wrong, or rude/inappropriate of me to say this in the middle of conversation. The situations turn out so bad, that i’m thinking maybe i may be doing something wrong?

Edit: some people seemed like they needed more info… 
All the conversations are almost always brought up by the other person.

149,1e8dpdt,AITA for not calling or going into work today?,"Okay so, I’ve been working at this car rental company for almost 3 years. In the 3 years I’ve had 4 managers because it’s a never ending cycle of people attempting to climb the corporate ladder. (1 was successful, 2 failed and the current one is TBD)

So I’ve gotten pretty used to telling new managers what days I’m available and what days I’m not because they love to change our schedules on the fly when they come in. Like sir I’m not changing my Sunday-Thursday schedule to a Saturday-Wednesday because it works better for you, I used to let them in the past but that was before I had a life LOL. 

Anyways so my current manager came into position mid June. At the time I had just ended my program at school and wanted to keep my current schedule for a little bit but after one Paycheck I realized I was counting Pennie’s and needed to make more moolah. I had a conversation with him and let him know I could work more days and hours and told him I could work Sunday-Thursday in the evenings.

He said okay and all was decent in the world until recently. He changed my fricking schedule without telling me. 

I even had a conversation with him in person last Thursday(the 11th) and he asked me what days I could work next week. I didn’t think it was weird for him to ask because I had booked the 17th off and thought he was just confirming if I still needed it off (I did) and told him “I could work Sunday-Tuesday, Wednesday off, working Thursday and Friday-Saturday off” (I didn’t mind only getting paid 4 days this week because I was doing a face painting gig that paid me $300 for 5 hours of work and that was way more then I’d make working a full day at work) 

Anyways he scheduled me to work today (Saturday) and I was gonna give him the benefit of the doubt and gaslight myself into thinking he didn’t hear me but when we were talking on the 11th he asked me if I wanted to work Saturdays and I said no because I needed that day off(it was my friends bridal shower and I’m a bridesmaid and wanted to meet her family before the wedding. I didn’t tell him about the bridal shower because I don’t think he needs to know that) and he joked about me making less money because I’d only be working 4 days, which isn’t true as we already know. 

So today I decided to not go into work or call in because I told him I couldn’t work today. And he texts me “Please always give me heads-up if you can’t make it. Today was very struggle day as we only had (coworker) and (coworker)”

 I’m hitting my breaking point at this company because we’re constantly understaffed, they keep trying to change my schedule and we’re going through a fricking extreme heat wave and work outside.

But I do kinda feel like TAH because I knew I worked today and still decided to not call or go in today and I left my other coworkers to pick up my slack and they didn’t deserve that but at the same time I feel like NTAH because it’s not my responsibility when this is a billion dollar company and they can hire a summer crew like they did last year.

Its been really demanding of him and hes spending a lot of free time catching up and has lost the work/freetime balance. 
He has ADD. 
In our latest couples counseling we discussed on how we could make things easier for him and he said that he needs to spend time after work to finish writing reports and other adminstrative stuff. 
We both work, he works full time and I get paid to work 3.5 days a week, the rest of the 1.5 days (I'm excluding weekends) I am a homemaker. We have two kids, 21+17, both with busy lives themselves, 1 dog and two cats. 

My husband said that he needs to take time to finish work before he takes on tasks at home. Which leaves me to do the dishes and make dinner and go grocery shopping if needed. 

I'm more or less fine doing that on the days I'm not getting paid to work, but feel resentful about it on the 3-4 days I am working. 

We talked about him finishing his work after dinner, but he finds it easier to not take a break and finish one thing before starting another. 

Which leaves me with the responsibility. (The kids help out too.)

I feel resentful because he always leaves later than I do (he plans his own days) and comes home later. 

I don't understand why he doesnt start his day earlier and he has no reason for it. 

Our couples counselor thought it was reasonable that I should take on the tasks after work, so my husband can finish his work, considering that with his ADD that its easier for him to stay on task. 

AITA to not find that a reasonable solution? 

I think it would be more reasonable to start the day earlier and then compromise on at least one day and chip in with making dinner, grocery shopping, dishes etc.

152,1e8dgyt,AITA For Refusing Service?,"Hi everybody! Some background information: I (F 19) have only recently started working as a bartender. I recently got my certification and license and got hired at a local bar with plenty of what I thought were kind patrons. I only got 3 full shifts of training and was thrown head-first into bartending by myself only this week. I have never before this job done anything with mixing drinks or serving food or alcohol.



Today I went to work, my third shift by myself and I work 11-12 hour long shifts. I had a full bar and multiple tables seated for almost 3 full hours today straight with no break. I was completely alone other than the cook who was working today. I had been feeding and serving one group an hour or two after opening, they would have a couple of beers an hour and were eating every once in a while. One man we will call G had come in earlier in the day, I gave him 2 or 3 beers and he left. This was before I had a full bar and everything else (around 12 or 12:30).



Later in the day, (5 pm) G came back. Even before he sat down it was clear he was intoxicated and had been drinking for some time, (eyes were bloodshot, slurring his words, fumbling with the menu, and was a bit wobbly walking up to the bar) come to find out he had gone to every bar in our small town (we have 5 bars within a couple blocks of each other and maybe more, I'm new to the area) and had roughly 2 to 4 beers at each stop. By the time he came back to us he had not eaten anything.



As I am a baby bartender I didn't want to refuse service. So, I asked the cook, who wasn't currently busy to come out and secretly evaluate him, herself. after just a few minutes she too said she would feel uncomfortable serving him. So I put in his food order and went over to talk with G. As politely as I could I said the following. ""Hey, I know you have asked for a Busch Light, but I don't currently feel comfortable serving you in the state that you are in as you are showing signs of intoxication. Once you've gotten some food in you we can absolutely re-evaluate and see where you are, in the meantime would you like some water or soda?""



From there he got pissed off with me and said that I was stupid and that he had never heard such bullshit before, he and that group I mentioned before got angry with me and proceeded to raise their voices at me and say ""That's not how that works, serve him his fucking beer."" ""You're going to lose your job."" Ect. I tried to tell them that I had just learned this in my training, that I had someone else say the same things I had,I just couldn't do so at the moment, and that I could lose my license if I did so. They continued to get mad at me.



I called the owner of the bar who told me that I did what I had thought was right and even though she thought it to be 'normal' behavior for that patron, that I should wait until he had eaten and then still give him what he wanted in terms of alcohol.

153,1e8dgek,AITA for negotiating with my family over a gift? ,"

Didn't really know what to title this that would properly summarise everything but I tried. 

So, to preface this post, my family and I (+ my mother) have been on extremely rocky terms, sometimes going no contact for several years. During my childhood, I either had very formal/limited contact with them, or none at all. This was fine with me because I didn't know any different. 

Flash forward several years of not having birthdays, avoiding celebrating Holidays together (or when we did, having a nice time without fights/explosive ourburst, which always happened) They're trying to be more involved in my life. This is neat, cool. However, the way they choose to get more involved with me is by gifting me things I need/want. Growing up low income without any help I guess changed how I perceived gifts, pair that with gifts not being my love language (but top 2 for my mother) so I guess I came off as ungrateful, but we'll get to that. 

My HS (GED) graduation comes around. My grandfather asks me in person what I'd like, as he typically had been for the past three-ish years for Christmas/birthday. I tell him I want a new phone because the one my mother had gotten me five years ago (Samsung J7 sky Pro, great phone) Was getting older, the camera was fuzzy, and the screen was shattered to bits. Anyway, he asks me what phone I want, and me being well... Me, I tell him after doing extensive research on the specific one I'd want for my next phone. Its the Samsung Galaxy s10+. (The one I'm currently using rn) He easily agrees to getting it and even adds it to his notes app, everything is fine. 

Then my mother gets a phone call several days later. Its my Uncle. Apparently the phone is too expensive now and they've ( grandparents and uncle) have discussed it together that they'll still get me a phone but it'll be the one they'd found that was a quarter of the price. Upon hearing this I'm hurt because they don't get it, my teenage brain is flooded with emotions, and I cry. 
 I tell them, that if its too expensive I'll combine all three holidays (birthday, Christmas, and Graduation) and wait another year until they can all pitch in and get it for me because it'd take me far too long to afford it on my own. It was my yearly gift from all of them and I'd done so much research on what phone I wanted, I was willing to wait to get it. 

They eventually agreed (Like a week of them trying to change my mind), my uncle apologised and said me being willing to wait for something proved I was mature and I guess deserving of it? Anyway, I suppose this is a ""WAS I the asshole"" for negotiating over a gift and not just being happy to get anything aka the substitute phone?

155,1e8cybc,AITA for going to a music festival?,"I (22f) love music, especially country, which I understand is a genre a lot of people don't like, but I grew up in a rural area and it reminds me of home, its my favorite genre.

My boyfriend (28m), we'll call him John, does not like country at all, he's not the biggest fan of music in general, but he despises country and anything really related to it, he is a city boy by definition and is not fond of my love of country music or the country aesthetic (not like fishing bass pro shop core more like rural gardening grandmacore if that makes sense, not important to the story but I feel like it adds to it).

There was a country festival a few states over that happened last weekend, there were some artists that I really really wanted to see. So months ago when tickets went on sale, I asked John if he'd like to go and he was iffy, he didn't like the idea of driving or paying for it, so I said I'd drive and pay. He was still unsure but I wanted a definite yes or no, which he would not give me. So I bought two tickets thinking either he'd come along or I could sell the extra later.

I kept asking John if he wanted to go and he kept saying maybe until a few weeks before he decided he didn't want to go and got upset that I had spent money on a ticket for him when it was clear he didn't want to go. 

Thankfully, the ticket didn't go to waste. I started a new job and a work friend (25m) also really likes country and some of the same country artists so I asked him if he wanted to go and he jumped on the chance. It was an awesome weekend, I was glad to go with a new friend since I've been having issues making friends since I just recently moved.

John was not happy that I 1.) Went without him. 2.) Went with another guy. 3.) Went at all. He thought he was clear that he didn't want to go to the music festival so I shouldn't have gotten tickets at all and that it was a waste of money and he was really upset that not only did I go to the fest, but I went with a man that he hasn't met yet  He also worried that it involved a mini road trip and was a multiple day camping music fest and that he wasn't there ""to protect me"".

This is totally out of the blue, he has never expressed that he needed to ""protect me"" before or has he ever stopped me from doing something I wanted just because he didn't. He usually lets me do my stuff alone because he doesn't like any of my interests so its not unusual for me to expect him to be okay with this.

I feel like his biggest issue is that it was country music? But I've gone to shows and fests of the music he likes so I don't know why the genre would matter. And I love country, I wasn't going to miss the opportunity to see my favorite artists just because he doesn't like country music, the festival was amazing btw, it was a lot of fun.

John ignored me for a bit of the week but has started pestering me today about all this.

So, am I the asshole for going to the festival? 

UPDATE: not really an update but more info, the coworker is gay. I work 10+ hour days with this dude and have for a few weeks, you get to know someone pretty fast that way, so even though we are new friends, he's not a stranger. And extremely gay and married to a man. My boyfriend knows this, I showed him my friend's Instagram and wedding photos. ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-21,"AITA for going to a music festival?

156,1e8cs5p,AITA for having overnight guests without telling my roommate who is at a weekend music event?,"For context, I (M24) was kicked out of my parents in Jan and ended up living with her (F30) in Feb. I pay her rent directly (as does her boyfriend), hardly legal but she’s technically my landlord. I’m in the process of finding a new home but places I can afford are few and far between and it’s been discussed that I’m moving out ASAP.

2 friends (F21, M22) stayed at the house. One of them we saw because he was helping a s\*icidal woman after a night out who had jumped in the river prior. It was past 4am and he had nowhere to stay that night. One slept in my room and the other slept in the smoke room. My roommate found out the next day through her bf that he had similarly let a friend in need stay that night without telling his gf/my roommate even though she’s away at a rave.

She sent me a long text saying it was disrespectful to her personally and “culturally” by letting them stay overnight without checking with her first. She made the point that I rent ""a room"" so all of the other rooms are hers, so she needs to know if anyone is coming to the house. She said that ""trust had been violated"" and ""it’s not a negotiable thing when it’s not your place to allow”. I apologised and explained the situation and that it was after 4am in the morning and I was just trying to help friends who had been helping a person and I didn’t wanna leave them with no way to get home. She’s not talking to me or her boyfriend who lives with us.

I understand it being her house etc. However, there is rarely a day that she doesn't bring at least 2 people to the house without any heads-up even in the middle of the night. She didn’t tell me her boyfriend was moving in at all until I woke up to see him outside with his stuff (he’s a nice guy though but still). I started a new job and told her I had to be up at 6:30 then she brought friends over at 2 and played music on a big speaker in the room next to mine with complete disregard to me. I have always told her in advance if I’m bringing someone over whether that’s only for a few minutes or a few hours but she never does the same even when she comes back from a party with her friends and strangers in the middle of night.

Despite me being very drunk and perhaps a bit quick to let them stay it wouldn’t have made sense to have called her at 4:30am to ask when we’re only 2mins walk away and she wasn't home anyway. Was I expected to wait outside with them all-night until they were cleared? My roommate said it ""probably"" wouldn't have been a problem if I'd asked (not that I, myself, would ever get the courtesy of being able to ask for no guests at any point).

Now I’m stressed that she’s going to ask me to leave without notice for betraying her trust. A smaller detail is that she doesn’t get along with one of my friends I had over but they slept in my room and my roommate wasn’t going to be home anyway (and still isn’t) therefore she wouldn't have to see her anyway, so what’s the issue?

157,1e8c8rz,AITA for freaking out at my kids for taking care of me too much? ,"
I (55F) lost my wonderful husband 1 month ago after a long battle with cancer. 

Thanks to my children, I was able to enjoy the last few months without working and with the help of nurses, all paid for by them (30M, 32M and 28F). 

Honestly, in the last 2 months before his death, I was already in grief, because I felt in my soul that he was no longer there, just his body... so when he left, it hurt, but I was already preparing myself emotionally for this and he rested finally.

Since then, my children have been very close to me, don't get me wrong, but for 15 days in a row, all or at least one of them came to visit me or even sleep with me. I talked to them, they slow down, but they still came to visit me 5 times a week and slept at home about 2 times. 

I love them, but loneliness isn't that bad and despite being in grief, I'm seeing a psychologist twice a week and coping, but they don't give me space and I've tried to talk to them other times about wanting to be alone more and they dismissed me by saying they would never leave me alone at that moment and that I need company.

I lost my mind when it was 1 month after my husband's death and the three of them came home, made my breakfast, stayed for lunch and made my dinner, they stayed with me all day and don't let me do nothing.  When, they mentioned having a movie session with their father's favorite films before bed, even after I said that I would like to be alone for a while tonight, because I wanted to pray and just exist. I said, in a louder tone, I appreciated all the concern, but I was feeling suffocated by them and all this concern and that I needed to clarify my boundaries since they weren't hearing me clearly and that they needed to go home and let me breathe.

They stayed quiet and left without saying much. 

Later, my oldest son texted saying he was sorry for making me feel suffocated, but they were just worried about me after losing my partner of 33 years, and like me, they are dealing with grief, but I would be left alone. 

It's been about 4 days since any of them have sent me a message or come to my house, I talked to my sister about it and she said I could have expressed myself better without being rude, because they are just caring for me.

160,1e8bz7s,AITA For Why My Friend Group Fell Apart?,"I just started college this year and am living in a halls of residence. Here I met a boy, let's call him James, and we hit it off. We took things slow and are now officially dating for nearly two months, and things are going great.

Over the course of the year, I made great friends with two girls and another girl and her boyfriend. We started hanging out, and after about a month or so, I invited James into the group with their permission, and we became a group of six. We were even thinking of flatting together next year however I don't see that happening anymore.

**Some Background:**

From the very first week of college, I had an experience with one of the girls. We went out to the clubs, and she promised she wouldn't leave me since it was my first time in a new city and I don't drink. However, not even 30 minutes in, she left me with some girls she had made friends with and started making out with a guy. After an hour and a half, I wanted to leave, but she insisted she would find her own way back. I expressed my concerns the next day, and she apologized. We moved on.

Next, there was the couple. They had been together for over two years but started having issues due to the girl's insecurities about her looks. She often compared herself to his ex and even to the other girl in our group. Despite my efforts to reassure her, the tension remained. They almost broke up but asked for forgiveness, and we all moved on.

**Mid-Semester Break** 

After the mid-semester break, the girls said I was spending too much time with James. I explained that I had mid-semester assignments due and hadn't been able to spend time with them but also that we had only been back at college for 4 days. They seemed to understand, I continued balancing my time between them and James.

As the semester ended, James and I made our relationship official. Shortly after, I became very sick. James took care of me, even though he had exams. Meanwhile, my group of friends didn't seem to care much, except for suggesting I go to the hospital. This hurt because when one of the girls pulled a muscle, everyone rallied around her.

**The Fallout**

After the break, things took a turn for the worse. On the first night back, James and I joined them for dinner, but they left within five minutes. They ignored us for the entire week and even left the Life360 group without telling us (which they made for us at the 1st week of college). Feeling hurt, I eventually left the group chat.

Despite everything, I continued to be civil, saying hi in the hallways, but rarely got a response. I feel that if they wanted to fix things, they would have approached me. I've always been there for them, picking them up from clubs, getting birthday gifts, etc. Now, it feels like we're strangers.

I don’t see what happened for us to stop speaking, but the problem seems to lie with them, not me. I just don’t have the energy to deal with this high school drama in college. AITA for why my friend group fell apart?

Nick(54M Brit) & I live in Kuwait, decided to elope in Dubai but turned to us having 15 people. It ended up being beautiful day with fancy dinner & me dressed like a bride. We splurged last min since people showed up to celebrate us without expecting any celebrations. My fam knew I would elope in UAE more than 2 months in advance with 5 friends & cousins from Dubai (which blew up a bit) none of them said they wanted to come. I offered to pay tickets & hotels if they did but they couldn’t make it.

Going into brief of each of them & their reactions. 



Mum never prioritized me, (when having a surgery (for precancerous growth) & arranged a nurse, mum insisted to be there for me, then asked #1 permission to go to the hospital with me lol - when I got upset about her needing permission to be there for me, her response was 'but she didnt say no right’.) She couldn’t make it because 'she was too tired' she's moved mountains for #1 #3 with actual fractures for less. Now she's super sad she couldn't attend & everyone is telling her how she treats me poorly compared to #1 & #3, Her sister told her off said she would have gone instead had she known my mom wasn't going.



#1 was in KW too,(in the US now)we has a good relationship with her being the classic dominating, demanding, narcissistic older sibling, who does no wrong, always the victim. Mums fav child, took me long to see it. Past 2yrs were rough I saw how selfish she really is, I started working in her business part time (she lied to me about $ to profit more %) showed her true side & I couldn’t excuse it any longer, so went sour. Was still nice tho but all I get is complains & drama. (Planned girls trip for her 40th in Bali, got her a lux bag, another time  traveled to Dubai on my dime to support her getting a house while I was unemployed). She sweet talks me into adding her to the ‘wedding girls group’ to be part of the process, Wedding day she sent a ‘congratulations' on the group but not to me/nick. I sms’d her a 'hi how are you' NO response, 2 weeks in & still nothing.



#2 (39F) Sweetest sister of all, overwhelmed with 2 kids, depression (because of #1 also treats her like shit). She tried but couldn’t make it, sent us gifts to my surprise, she was sad to not make it, me too



#3 (37F) & I have never been close. She can be sweet/ extremely crazy, no in-between, we are opposites but have a civil relationship.

164,1e8barq,AITA for causing an argument over my birthday? ,"All these communications have been over text message. 

Over the last few years, my childhood best friend, Ruth, has gotten married and started a family. Her life has transformed and of course, so have my expectations of her. She has a small child, traveling is hard, and we live several hours from each other. I’ve made the effort to come see them whenever I’m financially able to, as well as when my schedule will allow. 

Ever since the baby was born, Ruth will request that if I can’t go all the way to their house, that we meet halfway and have dinner together. I usually end up driving several hours after my work day to see them. I’ve been okay with this, I just wanted to see them.

About 6 months ago we had a disagreement and never talked it over completely. She expressed that she doesn’t like my partner and that he is why she doesn’t come all the way out to visit me anymore. I expressed that I’m not crazy about her partner either, but that we don’t need to be critical of each other’s choice in men. 

My birthday month rolls around. She wants me to meet her halfway again, on my birthday. It happens to fall on a work day for me. I decide that a later date would probably be better. There were multiple reasons why it was all around better for me to take it easy. 

She responded with an, “ok.” This isn’t normal for us, and I figured this ok had a lot more to it. She didn’t acknowledge the possibility of her coming all the way out, either. 

I asked something along the lines of, “Okay, maybe I’m reading into this a bit, but are you mad?” And she said that she’s, “not mad, just disappointed.” 

I went off, but didn’t sent the message. I revised the message until anything that can be misconstrued was gone. I didn’t want to leave this unspoken and begin to resent my friend. I also didn’t want to say hurtful things or get lost in all the emotions involved. 

I essentially told her that it’s my turn to be disappointed, because it’s my birthday, and she can’t even manage to make it out once a year. I’m coming out four times a year at least, and was planning to increase the frequency to once a month as my financial health improves. 

She said hurtful and rude things to me. She said that she wasn’t going to let me see the baby anymore. That I have a victim complex. I suggested she gets therapy because that’s just not true. 

We haven’t talked since. I’m open to the fact that I could be the problem. If I am the asshole, I think i must be too self-absorbed to see it. I need outside opinions.

We've been officially divorced for three months. I just found out that he has had a girlfriend since as long ago as December. (Not totally sure of this; a casual friend who told me about the new gf said she saw them together then. She only told me a couple days ago.) It turns out both of my young adult children (ages 21 and 18) have met her. I don't blame them for not telling me because they are the children and are doing their best to navigate this strange new situation. But. I called an old friend to see if she knew about the gf. 

She did. 

When I asked her why she didn't tell me, she said it wasn't my business. 

A little context about this friend: we're part of a friend group that consists of three couples. We all met in college and were part of each other's weddings and hung out a lot before we all had kids. My ex and I moved away a few years back but have stayed in touch with the old friends, visiting them when we go back home. On one such visit this past spring (probably about three months ago?) my ex went back, visited the friends and shared that he had a new girlfriend. Neither of the wives, who have otherwise been supportive of me throughout the divorce, told me.

And I don't blame him; I expected him to move on. I just would have liked to have been told. By someone. Am I an asshole for expecting that from a good friend?

 One of our old coworkers sisters' works at a salon nearby and they were hiring for an apprenticeship position. He decided to apply and I was like ""omg it'd be great if we both got hired."" I asked our coworkers sister if they were hiring for multiple aprentices and she said she ""thought so"".

My friend that I was applying with ends up calling me and telling me ""I don't mean to sound like a bitch  but I have less experience than you and I need this job more than you.

They text me that same evening and ask me to come back and shadow a stylist the comming Wednesday for 2  hours. I'm super stoked! But I ask my friend if he heard back from them and he said no so I kept quiet for a few days.

I decided to tell him the truth that I'll be moving on in the hiring process and since then he hasn't been talking to me at all. Completely been giving me the cold shoulder.

170,1e8am0p,AITA for asking my husband to sleep in the living room after getting drunk during family vacation,"My husband, his brother, his wife and I are on vacation together and staying in a 2bd-2br flat (each couple has their out bedroom and bathroom). We all get along really well and have vacationed together quite a few times before.

My husband snores and I am a light sleeper, usually I can get by with earplugs. However, when we gets drunk he sounds like a freight train and usually kicks, which means I do not sleep a wink. We used to fight about his drinking causing me lack of sleep, so we decided that whenever he wanted to drink more than a couple of beers, he would sleep in the living room.

Today, the second day of our vacation, he spent the whole day with his brother at an event and he got home quite drunk. As agreed upon at home, he’s sleeping in the living room so that I can sleep. But his brother seemed upset about this, and did not understand why he would not sleep in the room (a room he was paying for) with me. Since my husband was not sober, he was not the best at explaining our arrangement which left me explaining that I would not me able to sleep otherwise. 

My brother in law did not seem happy with this answer, and now I wonder AITA for sticking to our arrangement during vacation in a shared flat?

EDIT: Thank you all for your thoughts! It’s clear to me now that I may have taken BIL’s reactions a bit too personally, without taking into account how our sleeping arrangements might affect the rest of our party’s use of the living room. We did not discuss this in advance and even if no one “planned” to get drunk, we should have brought it up the first day as a possibility anyway.",Not enough info,2024-07-21,"AITA for asking my husband to sleep in the living room after getting drunk during family vacation My husband, his brother, his wife and I are on vacation together and staying in a 2bd-2br flat (each couple has their out bedroom and bathroom).

171,1e8af9g,AITA for keeping my extra reimbursement money?,"I (F19) have recently started a new full-time job! My first one at that. They sent me to a different location than what I was hired at bc the place isn't open yet. The drive to this location and home is 124 miles a day. I have to leave an hour early because of the length of this commute. I'm getting reimbursed for my miles and tolls. I do not have my own car yet so in the meantime I've been using my dad's since he works from home and takes the train to work twice a week. One of his tires has been giving us a lot of trouble and we've put like 3 patches in and it keeps leaking more and more air..

I got my first check back for the first week I had work! About $100 of nearly $300 was for gas and tolls. I sent my dad that money to make up for it, and then stated how my next reimbursement check was going to be more since I went to work more that week (the first week we had off one day) and my stepmom (who was in the room with us) said how my dad would be making a lot of money. I was confused and she said, ""Well it's his car, and it'll be used to fix the tire.""

I've stated a couple of times before that I had no problem paying for a new tire fully. With or without reimbursement, because at this point it's making the car unreliable and I still have to drive to work every day. It's also the fact that I drive his car more than he does so I'll take responsibility for it. She said, ""No he's supposed to get all of that money because it's his car, you're just driving it."" I also have been paying for gas, and again offered to pay to replace the tire. I've never worked in a place where I've gotten reimbursed for ANYTHING, so I just wanted to know if I was the asshole for keeping the rest of the money to contribute toward my own car?

EDIT:
I heard my dad and step mom (mostly my step mom) loudly talking downstairs last night and I heard her telling my dad things like “that money is yours she should’ve given it all to you I just want it to be fair for you” which I would’ve gotten if my dad had talked to me, yet like people have said it’s not her car and not her business. 
What really got me that I heard was “I was hoping to use that money for the cats I never even wanted.” Not that this requires any knowledge but we had about 8 cats dumped at our house by someone we were helping, and got not help from them for this. One of the cats got sick and had to get thousands of dollars of medicine over the course of about 2 1/2 months. ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-21,"AITA for keeping my extra reimbursement money?

172,1e8aeuh,AITA for not sharing all my food with BF,"BF(42) and I (39) have been together 3 years. He is a foodie; I am not. He was average size when we met. Upon looking at older pictures I realized he used to be overweight. Whatever. He has since put on a few extra pounds but nothing ridiculous. No big deal. His daughter (19) is 5 feet tall and just over 300 pounds…They have the same eating habits. 

Whenever we have food at a restaurant he wants to swap “a bite for a bite.” I’m always content with what is on my plate so I always decline. This upsets him because he feels that couples should share. He insists that I must not have learned sharing growing up. Not true..I come from a fam of 8 vs his fam of 4. 

He is the type of person who gets hungry any time he sees food, smells it, hears about, etc.. His go-to place whenever he wakes is the fridge. That’s fine, and I respect that. The issue is, if I have food he automatically wants a bite. Then he wants to wash it down with my drink. 

When I tell him there’s more in the kitchen he says “I just want some of yours”…even when I offer to get it for him! This irks me. I am a person that usually only puts on my plate what I know I can eat, so when he asks to share it I feel that he’s taking food from my mouth. Especially when it’s my leftovers and there’s only a little left anyway. 

While we’re eating he constantly stalks my plate hopeful that I won’t finish it all. He will always offer to help me finish if I can’t; never mind me only being 2 bites in. He becomes visibly anxious when he realizes that I won’t have anything left on my plate, and will usually say “aww man!” I’ve told him that I really don’t like it when he stalks my plate. 

Then, when we’re with friends he always makes sure to make it a big deal that I “don’t like to share food.” I don’t mind sharing sometimes. But why does he have to have some of literally EVERYTHING??!! 

I once chewed a fry to discover that it was slightly raw so I placed it on the edge of my plate. Moments later he reached over and ate it while my head was turned. He then acclaimed “that one was raw!” I said “I know. That’s why I spit it out and had it sitting off to the side.” He proceeded to get upset that I put a chewed up fry there for him to eat. 

He even got upset once because he found a Reese’s cup wrapper in my pocket from work because I didn’t bring him one. I’ve never been with anyone like this. He claims that his behavior is common and that I’m being rude.
