0,1e8t1ph,WIBTA if I called out my trans cousin?,"As a bit of a back story. 

Recently my cousin came out as trans mtf. Which is great. I support her. 

But. She won't make any form of transition. She has the support and resources to do so but yet refuses to do so. I know because she literally told my aunt that she won't transition. But she demands to go into women's restrooms and changing rooms. And I'm starting to think she's only doing it to get into those spaces.

1,1e8dfit,AITA For telling my mom that I canâ€™t get a job to maintain her?,"Hi! Iâ€™m currently typing this in tears, so I apologise if it gets kind of weird in some parts.

So I (16f) have lived with my mother (50f) most of my life. Initially, it was us and my grandmother (76f) in our apartment, marked by frequent arguments. My brother's passing due to an assault strained us financially, leading my mom to work long hours and occasionally cope with alcohol, blaming me during her outbursts.
My grandfather's cancer diagnosis during the pandemic added even more stress, leading to constant fights. 

Eventually, my mom sent me to live with my dad (50m), who supported me through depression and accepted my pansexual and transgender identity. I returned to my mom after two years, finding her changed after quitting drinking and starting her own business. Recently, after my grandfather's death by cancer, my grandmother came back to live with us. 

Tonight, when I was making dinner, my mom sat me down and told me that she wasnâ€™t to make it to the end of the month if things were going as they are. She told me that in two days I must have a job that I wanted to apply to, and to tell her so we could start the paperwork. She told me this in a tone that said that it was a closed matter, and that I had to do it. I told her in response that I had looked, and I literally, canâ€™t work anywhere because of school. Then, she just told me to figure it out, because if I didnâ€™t, she would have to kick me out, because she couldnâ€™t maintain other two mouths. That really shocked me, and I told her that if she was so desperate, she could also get a part time job, and I would take care of the house, since I know it consumes a lot of time. But she got pissed by that, and told me that by tomorrow night I really should have something, otherwise, tonight was going to be my last night with her.

What do I do? Was I in the wrong by saying that to her? Should I drop out and find something to help her? Or should I confront her again?

2,1e8a6lp,AITA for telling my husband it serves him right when he got food poisoning after not listening to me?,"So I've (37F) always been a little neurotic about food safety. Some of it comes from having worked in restaurants most of my life, but me and my sister also frequently got sick from my grandmother's cooking when we were kids.

My husband (36M) tends to handwave my ""obsession"" with food safety. It wasn't a big issue until he started learning to cook in earnest about 3-4 years ago. He's no careless buffoon, but when my suggestions are more conservative than Reddit's consensus, he'll get cranky about it. (Ex: if I suggest that he temp something that is almost certainly cooked through, he'll roll his eyes and do it begrudgingly.)

Two weeks ago, as we're unpacking groceries, one of the condiments looks off to me; it's too dark, the oil looks separated, and I strongly suspect it's spoiled. He's the one who buys/eats it, so instead of throwing it away, I point it out to him: ""Hey, this looks weird and I don't think you should eat it. Take a photo, ask for a refund, and throw it away."" He inspects it and agrees that it looks weird but still puts it in the pantry. Over the next few days, as I notice he hasn't thrown it away, I bring it up a few more times to no avail and eventually drop it.

A few days ago, he texts me to say he has to stop working early (he works from home) because he threw up twice. He's hardly ever sick, so I'm like wtf?? Later, when I get an explanation: HE ATE THE DAMN SAUCE and puked it up less than 3 hours afterwards. I'm annoyed, but he looks miserable, so I crush my annoyance down to the size of a pebble, make him a glass of electrolytes, and set him up on the couch with a wastebasket and Darkest Dungeon 2. Additional context for my annoyance: I have a doctor's appointment the next day, and he agreed to come with me weeks ago; I'm nervous about the appointment and don't have anyone else to ask on short notice. The timing sucks, tbh.

Fortunately, the acute phase is over quickly; he's back to 90% (his estimate) the next day and comes with me to the doctor. I've been pretty accommodating up to then, but as he's making himself food, I can't contain it anymore. ""I wasn't going to say 'I told you so' while you were sick, but since you're feeling better: I TOLD you that sauce was off, I TOLD you to throw it away, and look what happened. Hope you learned a lesson."" An argument follows. His points: he checked the expiration date (fine); he smelled it first (fine); him getting sick was a fluke, everything worked out, and I'm being an AH for acting like I knew it would get him sick. My point: I WAS RIGHT.

Now we're at a stalemate; if y'all think I was the AH for kicking him while he was still 10% down, then I promise to apologize. Otherwise, I'm sticking to my guns.

Edit: Didn't expect this to blow up! I'm not much of a Reddit person, but I'll address a few things I see in the comments just for closure's sake. 

1) It was definitely the sauce that got him sick. He works from home and can't drive, so he pretty much never leaves the house, we don't have children, nobody's been over in the last week, the timing made it pretty obvious (he literally only threw up twice and it was right after he ate), and I never got sick despite being around him. He threw it away!

2) Some folks are saying that ""food poisoning"" doesn't set in that quickly, but it definitely can, and it's pretty easy to Google that, so you can do that if you want. There are cool charts and everything!

3) Obviously the character limit reduces stories like these to their bones and leaves them open to infection with whatever twisted personal fantasy you want to project onto them, but for the record: he and I both got a huge laugh at everyone foaming at the mouth to tell me how horrible I sound; we've known each other since we were 14, we are best friends, and we both have anxieties that might make us seem insufferable to other people (see: he doesn't drive), but we do our best and love each other anyway.

4) I apologized, but so did he. Everybody won. ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-21,"AITA for telling my husband it serves him right when he got food poisoning after not listening to me?

3,1e89ylm,AITA for spending time with my boyfriend while my Mum is ill?,"Throwaway account :)

There is such a long history of drama when it comes to me (22F), my Mum (51F) and my boyfriend (25M) - It's always just been me and my Mum, until I met my boyfriend. Because of this, my Mum doesn't like when I spend time with him in general, this has been the same since I started dating him and we've been constantly arguing ever since. She makes me feel guilty for spending time with him, says I don't love her or care about her when I leave her to be with him, and generally makes me feel like such a shitty daughter because I don't prioritise her. 

She has recently been diagnosed with a new long-term health condition, which has led to her being admitted to hospital over a month ago now. Thankfully she's on the road to recovery, and her condition is almost in remission.  She has been put on very strong meds as part of her recovery plan, which are having some nasty side effects. It's common with these steroids to experience quite bad symptoms when coming off them, which is where the problem starts.

She is expected to finish this course of steroids the week my boyfriend has taken on leave from work, as it's his birthday. He gets four (4) weeks off a year, he works over 50 hours a week, so I barely get to see him. 

My Mum was talking about how her steroids finish the same week as my boyfriend's birthday, and she asked if I'd be spending a lot of time with him that week. When I said yes, most likely, we have plans - she completely blew up. We had a big argument about how that makes her feel like I don't care about her. In summary, she says that I'm selfish and I never prioritise her anymore, my boyfriend is more important. 

I think it's an important point to add that I am not her carer. She is fully capable of looking after herself, can drive, my grandparents and brother live very close by. Because I live with her, it seems to always come down to me to make sure she is okay, to keep an eye on her, to make sure she is looking after herself properly. 

I think she is hurt that I'll be spending time with my boyfriend when she'll be experiencing particularly horrible symptoms from her medications, but it's the one week Ill get to spend some quality time with my boyfriend when I barely see him anyway. She thinks I'm being selfish, I think I am putting myself first just for one week.

I'm a 20F who had a friend group w/ Tia 22F, Lee 23M, Clara 22F, & Kylie 22F. K turned on me as planned our grad ceremony w/ Olivia 21F. 

The budget was $375, school venues were no cost, & other venues cost ~$5K. I explained this to our team (w/ K).
Kylie added J ~22F to the gc who complained that we were making selfish decisions (abt the venue). I wrote that it was hurtful to be accused of excluding ppl & we had no money for what they wanted. K said I was hurtful by involving my feelings, suggesting I should quit.
I messaged Kylie I was hurt. She said I had no right to feel hurt bc it wasn't hurtful. She accused me of things I didn't do (ex. hiding info). She threatened to show our convo to the ""entire cohort"", saying they would side with her. Meanwhile, my other friends were with me.

Tia pressured me to call Kylie, as I was sobbing. Lee & Clara agreed. I called Kylie & she was unserious/sarcastic. They urged me to talk to her again; I was hesitant bc she did this after I confided abt my depression and moral scrupulosity OCD.
We had a meeting abt the ceremony & they tried to oust us. Olivia had a panic attack and left. I was angry as they ignored Olivia. I defended her saying we got harassed over this. J denied it saying I had no proof. I replied, ""I have the receipts but I won't show it, bc that's not right."" Kylie thought I was calling her out, but it was abt the gc.
Kylie went to the director about us; he defended us & corrected her. She never rescinded her statements.
My friends and I planned a trip w/o her, but they continued on with Kylie w/o acknowledging what happened. I said I did not expect them to cut her off, just to hold her accountable. It bothered me that they continued on w/o questioning her. I wanted them to tell me that she wronged me.
Kylie's other friends unfollowed me on IG & treated me like air. 
I confronted them about Kylie; they told me ""she did nothing wrong"" & ""it wasn't that bad."" Months later, Kylie denied she did wrong, saying I didn't deserve an apology after calling her out (her assumption). It took 2 hrs to convince her she did wrong. I said if she wanted to make it right, Kylie had to re-read the texts. She refused, saying she wasn't ""mature enough"" and we would never speak again. She also said my friends were aware she felt this way. 
I called Lee, saying that I found out they were deceiving me (they told me K was apologetic and willing to talk it out). I said I wasn't going to get mad at them, but that's what I heard from her. They all avoided me. During that time, I got hospitalized and still no contact.
I asked Lee if I should cancel my flights for the trip. Lee told me he was unwilling to talk to Kylie about what she did and that we should stop being friends. Clara sent a similar message.

8,1e89pq1,AITA for refusing to raise the toilet seat before going to the washroom?,"so recently in my (f16) household, there has been issues with my brother (m21) and dad (midk) leaving a LOT of droplets of pee on the toilet seat. I have voiced my complains almost every time it happens, but nobody has yet to take action. I find this gross, because both are old enough to raise the toilet seat, or clean up after. As for my dad, he has had previous medical issues and his bladder is a bit weaker, but he is not disabled by any means, and can easily clean up after himself. (I also want to mention I have PCOS and incontinence, so I have a weaker bladder as well,) But the issue has mostly been my brother. My mom (fidk) has been trying to resolve this, by coming up with the idea; ""everybody should raise the toilet seat after/before they go to the washroom, so that it's fair."" I found this idea ridiculous, because I am NOT the one leaving piss on the seat, so why should I have to touch the dirtiest part of the seat every time I need to pee? By the way I'm okay with putting down the actual lid to flush (not the seat), and often do, but less often so in the main floor guest washroom, since there are no toothbrushes in there. (where this issue arised) She says that if I don't follow the rule, its only fair that I'm the one left cleaning up the droplets. I think I may be the AH, since I understand that people do forget, or have times where they urgently need to leave after, or whatnot, but I think 90% of the time the extra 3 seconds it takes to raise the toilet seat before pissing is NOT a big ask. I'm not even asking for them to lower it after, I'm just tired of wiping other people's piss off the seat.

9,1e89mtj,AITA for canceling a weekly hangout with gf to eat with family that came over last minute?,"My family comes over randomly and they don't ever plan things in advance. My gf(24) gets mad at me(26) that I always cancel our weekly hangout. To give more context, I only ever cancel plans if its for friends/family that do not live or see often, as they live far away. My aunt just flew in for business and wants me to come eat dinner with her and the rest of the family. My gf and I do not have anything planned for the night other than just grabbing dinner and watching tv after. Its something we automatically do every weekend. If we had plans for something important to do that day like attending her friends' bday, or a fancy restaurant reservation then I would not cancel my plans to hang out with, but this is just a weekly thing that I don't think is that important. Its not like we only see each other once a week. We hangout randomly throughout the weekday, like grabbing dinner and lunch.

She says that I do not prioritize her but I really do like her. Its just suffocating that I feel that I am forever chained to not be able to cancel on a hangout thats just a regular hangout day.

10,1e89cpz,AITA for wanting my partner to see I've done just as much as her financially?,"My partner constantly holds over my head that she's given me about 20 grand. This hasn't been in one lump sum...she counts my share of an interstate move because I couldn't afford it the way she wanted to do it, paid for my car windows to be repaired and registered and a couple of other bills over the past 4 years.

I always get told she's won't hug me or stroke my hair because she's either too stressed or doesn't feel like she wants to because I'm not doing enough her. In the 5 years we've been together, she has not once done anything for my birthday, and one year talking about it she said she was going to get me something so I would shut up about it.

During this time, we have lived together for 38 months. She has paid 8 months rent. For some reason or another she always just stops paying. Whilst I am incredibly grateful for everything she has done, I'm starting to get tired of constantly feeling punished and like I work for her. She can always go into the city to visit her family, but whenever I want to do something for the two of us, she's always too busy or 'too stressed'.

The other day I did what I swore I'd never do, and actually sat down and worked out how much I've paid in rent, her business registrations, car registrations, bills etc...it's 1000 off what she has paid for my shortcomings.

I am very much an all in for the relationship person, and I've always just paid the rent because for a long time I believed it was my way of showing my gratitude, however she still talks about how much I owe her. She has been away for a little while and I've gained huge clarity.

AITA for wanting her to see that even though my share looks different, I have actually been the one keeping us functioning?

I also feel it important for perspective that she owns property. Mortgage free. I do not own any.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-21,"AITA for wanting my partner to see I've done just as much as her financially?
