0,1e9l7xu,Update - AITA for telling my father to get over the vase my son broke?,"After reading your comments, I decided to offer to buy my father a new vase again.

I explicitly told him this would be the last time I'd make that offer. If he said no and continued to complain about it, he wouldn't be allowed to see my son until he'd calmed down. He eventually agreed.

The store he'd bought the original vase from does not exist anymore, so I started doing some research. I found one I thought was very similar at a furniture store near my place. I'd bought vases from them before, so I knew they had great quality.

On Saturday, we went on our monthly lunch at my father's place, and took the opportunity to give him the new vase. He seemed grateful at the time, and had a cute moment with my son as they filled it up with the corks. I thought this was done.

But the next day, my father called me. He had looked up the new vase online and noticed it was ""less expensive"" than he expected. Then he asked, ""are you sure this is the best you could find?""

That's when I said screw it. I'm done with his passive aggressiveness. I told my father we're no longer going to his place for anything. If he wants to see my family, he can come to ours.

He protested, but I held my ground. My father did not communicate his wishes at any point, and still complained about the outcome. I'm done watching my family be accused of being bad people, and I don't want this behavior to extend to my son any more than it already has.

So this is where we stand now. My father doesn't like driving to my place, so I'm not sure about the future of our monthly lunches.

I love my father, but I am extremely disappointed in him. If all this means I will see him less than usual for a while, I might be a little glad. The time apart might be good for us. My greatest concern is my son's relationship with his grandfather, which I will try to encourage.",UPDATE,2024-07-22,"Update - AITA for telling my father to get over the vase my son broke?

1,1e9jul2,UPDATE: AITA for making my family cancel their vacation because i wont watch their dogs?,"Link to the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1e6ls16/aita_for_making_my_family_cancel_their_vacation/).

My brother apologized and we were having a very good and calm conversation. We were getting to a point where I was willing to make a compromise because I finally felt heard.

Then my SIL, who had had an attitude the whole time, snappily said ""okay so what do we need to do to resolve this"". Things started to get heated because I felt her tension and tried to acknowledge it.

I said that I was really hurt by my SILs actions. I left it out of my og post, but she was complaining about helping me clean my house before my wedding. I later found out that she told my dad that I had moldy dishes in the sink and that was humiliating. I said it hurt a lot when I learned she brought it up again as part of her argument why I should watch the dogs. She sarcastically said ""oh so I'M the villain"".

I said ""I feel like from what I have gathered from my parents this past week that you think I'm sabotaging this vacation because I'm jealous that I can't go. And if you think that, you really must not know me, and that hurts."" and she said with the same rude tone as earlier, ""I must not know you because that is 100% what I think."" My eyes welled up because I felt like she had just suckerpunched me, and she looked at me and said ""Here comes the temper tantrum"".

I stood up to leave. Then I turned around again and said over everyone yelling my name to calm down ""If you with all your time, money, and resources, decide to not go on vacation, that is your own decision and not because of me."" I got the hell out of the house and sat in the car until my husband came out.

She was in my wedding. I have been so happy to have her as my SIL. I have been nothing but loving to her. Now I see she doesn't give a fuck about me. I'm gutted. It's clear that she has zero respect for me and probably never even liked me. I'm devastated because my family is everything, and I feel like my relationship with my brother will forever be altered. She is not the person I thought she was, and now I'm not only NOT watching the dogs, but I guess I am also accepting that I don't have a sister like I thought I did.",UPDATE,2024-07-22,"UPDATE: AITA for making my family cancel their vacation because i wont watch their dogs?

2,1e9e1s3,AITA for causing “emotional damage” to my father,"I (ftm16) my siblings, and my dad (52) went on a trip to visit family this past week. 

On one of the days, my cousins/siblings and I decided to go to the mall to get some clothes. I have been out as trans for going on 2 1/2 years at this point. When I was at the mall, I finally decided to get some dress clothes since I don't own any. My family isn't the most accepting at all, and they deny I'm trans at all although I am out and have gotten referrals to start HRT and have gender dysphoria diagnosis. 

My grandpa gave each of my siblings and I 100 dollars to spend at the mall, and if we go over, we would have to pay for it (100% fair and i'm very grateful) 

With my money (as in the money Grandpa gave me), and good sales, I got dress shoes, a button down shirt, a belt, and a pair of pants

I was extremely excited and I liked how I looked in it. To this point, I never had my own, it was always stuff I stole from my sibling or I had to wear a dress/skirt to church. 

We were staying at the mall after we all got our stuff to eat dinner, while I was waiting for my siblings to come back, I showed my dad what I got. He got furious that I would have the nerve to get pants that are 28/30 and they were from the boys section. He told me that they weren't designed to fit me and I looked horrible. He also said I was not a boy, and I needed to stop getting stuff that isn't for me. but He said that I had to return them as soon as possible and practically dragged me back to the store to do the return. 

We finally agreed that I can keep them, and we left to get dinner. 

Today, while we were coming home from the airport, my dad told me I had to pay him back the money I spent on the clothes. He said that I hurt him a lot, and it wasn't my money in the first place to get that type of stuff. I should have gotten regular girl stuff, like he and my grandfather thought I would get. He said I caused emotional distress for himself. I told him no, and he called me an asshole and ungrateful. He also started to complain about how I never wear any of the clothes he gets me in general, like skirts, dresses, girly shorts, makeup, and bras. 

Idk. Maybe he's right, I should have gotten those stuff with my own money.

ETA: I want to say I've also been living as a boy for the last 2 years, although I'm pre-T, I have a baby face and can pass as a 12-13 yo boy. I bind everyday and I use a packer. Almost no one who is a stranger knows I'm trans and I can go into the boys bathroom without anyone batting an eye at me.

The short of it is my boyfriend and I haven't had sex for a year, I pay all of the shared bills expect for food, I do almost all of the cooking and all of the deep cleaning, and now I have been tasked with taking care of his son almost every night thanks to his new job. I tried to express my concerns about his new hours and me not wanting the extra responsibility and he essentially told me it wasn't up for discussion. 

My boyfriend's son plays football and practice is starting back up soon. That means a normal day for me will be getting up at 5am for work, driving 45 minutes home, start prepping dinner (if I'm lucky), drive 45 minutes to get to practice, drive 45 minutes home, finish dinner, clean up after dinner, shower, and then go to bed. My boyfriend will also be working one day every weekend (which wasn't what he told me when he started, he said he would have weekends off) so that means I'm responsible for also getting his son to and from his weekend games (some of which can be up to a three hour drive each way but are typically an hour each way).

For me this means more wear and tear on my car, more money for gas, and a heaping pile of added stress on my plate. My boyfriend said it was unfair of me to think about things this way, and I disagree. He essentially told me if this wasn't something I was interested in doing he didn't see a future with me because it signaled to him that I don't care about his son. 

This whole situation is making me question if motherhood is even something I want to experience. I value my alone time and structure and this new schedule is going to eliminate both of those things from my life. I'm already struggling with depression and I just don't think I'm capable of doing this, especially in addition to all the other issues in our relationship.

10,1e90ieu,AITA for confronting my friend group about leaving me out all the time?,"Okay so for some context; I have known most of this group for almost three years now and I met them from dating a member of the group. I had known let’s call him John since my first year of highschool and we were good friends. We started dating after highschool which is when I met the group. 
The group was made up of all guys at the time but I wasn’t bothered by it because we all got along really well. Another member of the group had started dating this girl and many of the guys were apprehensive at first but being the only other girl I reached out to her and we became fast friends. 
Everything was going great until new years. John started inviting his younger sister who’s the same age as me to every party that we had and normally I wouldn’t have an issue w this however she started acting really cold to me whenever I was visiting him so she made me uncomfortable. 
My friends girlfriend got along w johns sister really well so they started hanging out a lot and eventually his sister was invited to every hang out and I started getting ignored. It was gradual at first like they would all plan hangouts while I was at work (I only worked weekends at the time) and they would plan these hangouts for days were I had 10 hour shifts and would ask me to come after work. But I was exhausted and yet I still made it out. 

Anyways, John and I ended up breaking up which was super hard on both of us and it sucked. But we decided to stay friends but after we broke up whenever the group hung out no one talked to me. And in the gcs whenever I was just laying in bed they would all be hanging out and I didn’t even know about it. And this happened a lot turns out they were hanging out every few days and the only time I ever knew about anything was because they would post photos into the group chats that I had made. A few nights ago I broke down to one of my other friends and told them everything that was going on and they said that I deserved better than them. 
Here’s where I may be TA I confronted the group and told them everything I had felt. Including that I knew about all the private hang outs and the group chats they had made without me. Then John then decided to private message me and said that I needed therapy, that he didn’t want me messaging him anymore and that I was going to lose all of my friends. 
So I apologised to the group for saying how I felt and I left all of the chats. I do still have one friend in the group however that I’ll call Steven because he rarely looked at the chats and he actively wanted to hang out w me. So I had told him about all the hangouts they all had and he had no idea about any of them. Turns out that he and I were being excluded as much as each other. And apparently someone in the group messaged after I had left and said “we’ll need to get her back” this was last Tuesday and I haven’t heard a word from anyone except Steven.

11,1e9ssx2,AITA for being being snappy with my friend because of her crush?,"A few months ago, my friend started talking about this new guy she met at an activity outside of school. They had talked a little, and after a few interactions, she claimed to be completely in love with him. At first, the issue she was having was that he would talk to her non-stop through text, but as soon as they were somewhere together in person, he would completely ignore her and would only interact with a different girl. She recounted all of this to me, including how upset she was. She was crying herself to sleep, felt really tired, and lost her appetite. Then, she found out that he had a crush on another girl. She was convinced that he had a crush on her and was crushed when he told her about the other girl. He would text her nonstop about this other girl, and even when she tried to change the subject, he would keep ranting about her. 

I just felt bad for my friend and tried to help her out, until she told me about some of the things this guy had said to her. He would get super angry at her if she stopped talking to him and forced her to promise to never even joke about blocking him. He called his crush horrible things because she had been with three other people, the same amount he had been with. He told her that if his crush didn't date him, he would end himself in front of her to traumatize her. My friend got angry and told him off causing her to be mad for a week and text me non-stop. Eventually, she tried to get him to promise to not say stuff like that, and the guy agreed but said, ""you know, I found a loophole. I'll just threaten to end it if you stop talking to me."" She was obviously distressed, and I tried to give her advice.

The next week though, she hung out with him and was completely in love again. She spammed my texts talking non-stop about him and how much she loved him. I wanted to be happy for her, but I couldn't move past the other things she had told me. Everytime she texts me about him now, I get really angry. I keep trying to get through to her and tell her that he's not a good person, but she just keeps saying stuff like ""oh well, it's for the plot"" and ""it will be a future story to tell my grandchildren."" She never takes my advice, and I am sick of only talking about this guy. Everytime we talk, she always has to steer the conversation toward this guy. 

I have started getting pretty snappy in my responses when she talks about him and I can feel it causing tension toward us. The same things has been happening between her and another close friend, but I think the other person handles it better than me. I don't know why I'm so angry. I don't want to harm our relationship, but I am sick of her nonsense. She has made questionable decisions in the past with guys that she came to regret, and I want to make sure she is really thinking before she acts, but she won't listen. Am I the asshole?

I've been homeschooled due to my condition for the past couple years, because I couldn't go to school without getting sick enough to be in the ER like every week. About a year ago I decided I wanted to get back into the world of education and started to look into going to my local community College since it would have easier schedules for me and smaller classes. In my state all ungraduated minors are required to take a test to prove proficiency in math, writing, and reading before they can take any college classes. I have always been fairly good at reading and writing (though admittedly I've gotten worse after I started homeschooling), but I was confident I could pass those sections of the test. My real nemesis was the math, and my mom (as much as I love her) can't teach for the life of her (despite literally being a middle school teacher, story for another day) so I asked for her to get me a math tutor. She's always slow to respond to stuff so I had to practically beg her before she even looked for a tutor for me. Eventually, though, she got me one and I've been learning with him for about 8 months.

16,1e9rj20,AITAH for Not Changing the Date of my Graduation Party?,"Last month, I (17F) graduated from high school alongside my cousin Grace (19F). It's common here to have graduation parties soon after graduation, so I sent out virtual save-the-dates in early April for June 1st, to accommodate my maternal grandparents who live far away. In mid-May, after confirming attendance with key people, we mailed official invitations to a broad list of family, friends, and acquaintances.

Soon after, my dad's sister asked us to change the date of my party because Grace wanted that day. Grace and I used to be close, but our relationship deteriorated after she transferred to my high school in 11th grade. She constantly competed with me, made hurtful comments, and caused friction with my friends. Despite my initial efforts to include her, she accused me of overshadowing her, leading to further distancing.

My parents refused to change the party date. My aunt responded with a barrage of messages, insisting they thought we'd have a joint party and that Grace was having a tough time because of me.

Last month, I (17F) graduated from high school alongside my cousin Grace (19F). It's common here to have graduation parties soon after graduation, so I sent out virtual save-the-dates in early April for June 1st, to accommodate my maternal grandparents who live far away. In mid-May, after confirming attendance with key people, we mailed official invitations to a broad list of family, friends, and acquaintances.

Soon after, my dad's sister asked us to change the date of my party because Grace wanted that day. Grace and I used to be close, but our relationship deteriorated after she transferred to my high school in 11th grade. She constantly competed with me, made hurtful comments, and caused friction with my friends.

18,1e9qvxt,AITA I kicked my friend from my house after we argued.,"I kicked my friend from my house after we argued. This friend of mine is from high school, and we used to stay in a dormitory together in high school. Naturally, boundaries are not that strict in high school, and you know how the teenage boys are, and it was an only boys high school, so you get the idea. After high school, we parted ways and didn't see each other for 5-7 years due to university education. Later, we reconciled through a mutual occasion, and years later, he came to visit me at the town I studied and working at the moment. He is a doctor, and I am a computer engineer.

However, it felt like the exact same bully behaviour from our childhood was standing before me. Despite the years that had passed, he showed no signs of growth or maturity. He still exhibited childish behaviors such as dissatisfaction with literally every minor thing and belittling others. This continued for three days. I mostly tolerated it, but when I told him it was wrong and I was highly frustrated with his behavior, he labeled me as ""gay"" and ""spoiled."" I repeatedly warned him, but he seemed to take pleasure in provoking me.

When his departure was five hours away, I went to my room out of anger. As I was leaving the living room, he sarcastically asked if I was offended and called me ""gay"" again. After I went to my room, I texted him to ""get lost."" He came to my room and asked if I was serious. I said yes, stating that I couldn't babysit him anymore. As he left, he said, ""Even an enemy wouldn't do this to you. Get lost from my life,"" and blocked me on WhatsApp. So I feel like I am right in every way, but the thing is that I'm still not pretty sure where my behavior stands. He knows no one in the city I live in, so I texted him directions to the bus station, but he didn't have anywhere to go until his ticket time.

I work at a place that delivers services to clients and it is funded by the government. I also work with family and for the sake of this ever getting back to me I will be using different relationship connections.

I’ve recently become extremely miserable from the setting of the job that I just now realized that what I’ve been doing is basic, simple fraud (on my end at least). There have been news of investigations going on in businesses like the one I work at and I have been extremely scared. 

I am actively searching for other jobs so I can leave ASAP, but I fear if I don’t speak up and they get caught I would be held liable for the things I did and essentially be in trouble. I will admit a lot of this talk of reporting is fueled by the mistreatments and blatant out illegal things they’ve done (not paying overtime, falsifying hours worked, overworking, etc). I am still figuring out how to report it and go about it but would I be the asshole if I went through with it? There’s also they saying of “minding your own business” but if things were to go wrong and they got caught they would not hesitate to throw me under but if I were to report it, they would get mad so I’m not sure anymore.

20,1e9qdzz,AITA for being “too sensitive about my mom’s blatant racism”,"I (17F) called my mom (45F) to ask when she would be home ,at my grandmother’s request, as she was a bit late. She informed me that she was just turning onto the road near our house. She then went on to explain that she was late because she had stopped and talked to a couple sitting in a park  that stood out to her due the women looking distressed.  Reasonable enough I guess.  She said she felt like she needed to stop and talk to them, she ended up talking to them and everything seemed fine, my mother  gave them a card for the church she goes to and that’s all she told me. She hung up as she was now in the driveway and came inside.  

After she came in she decided to continue the conversation as she wanted to tell the story to my grandmother.  However as she told the story she divulged a detail that she left out. They were Chinese. On the surface this is no big deal, but growing up in a white, lower middle class, conservative Christian household, who believe CRT is just propaganda and should be removed from schools, when the race of someone in a conversation isn’t white, you brace for impact.  

At first everything was fine she was talking about what happened and then I asked “so they stood out cause she looked distressed” and she said “I only really noticed them because they were Chinese”…… silence, I’m laughing uncomfortably cause usually she’s not so blatant.

I’m trying to not start an argument but I also want to see if this is what she meant to say or if maybe she just said it weird. So i say “so if they weren’t Chinese you wouldn’t have noticed them?” and she quickly responded yes. She went on to say that even if she wasn’t distressed she probably would have stopped just because of how out of place they looked……

I don’t exactly remember how this nugget got dropped but at one point she said “he was surprisingly handsome for a Chinese person”

At this point I start  trying to explain that is infect NOT a normal thing to say to which she said yes it is and it’s “ just her preference”. We got into a small argument where she said I was being to sensitive about it, which was broken up by our grandma needing help with something.

The reason I’m here is because I want to know if I was wrong for basically calling her racist. And if I’m being too sensitive or if this is in fact just blatant racism. I feel like the answer is obvious but I really don’t want to come off as an annoying 17 year old who just argues with people over something that just isn’t that deep

We’ll call my roommate “E” for simplicity sake from this point further.

 “E” is my little brother’s friend from highschool and attended a university approximately 45 minutes away from where he lived (but 12 minutes away from where my home is) thus prompting him to ask if he could move in with me while he went to school. Obviously with my schedule for work and at that point I was single with very few people to help me take care of my dog so this situation worked out good for me and it was overall mutually beneficial, so I said yes. Fast forward approx two years, “E” has failed out of the college he was attending, tried community college and dropped out again, quit one job, fired from another, unemployed for a period of 6 months and didn’t pay rent that entire time, used my car during that time (he also got it towed, and I had to pay to get it back *$400*) because he totaled his, and now he is at his current job (and has been there for about 4 months now) has wrecked/ totaled his second car going to work, and is now on his third car and effectively has no money. I pay for everything that people would assume is normally split two ways (laundry detergent, toilet paper, paper towels, all the bills associated with the house, etc) and “E” never offers to chip in or help with basic consumable items. 

“E” is again struggling to pay me rent even with his current job (I probably should have mentioned this prior but I charge “E” $200 a month for rent with no rules on how he pays it so currently he tries to pay $50 a week and still can’t manage it). He no longer helps take care of my dog and barely does the one other task I ask of him (mow the backyard which takes less than 20 minutes). Due to the time period where “E” wasn’t paying rent, he currently owes me $2,300 between missed rent, getting my car towed, buying HIM groceries that he can’t pay back, and now I’m struggling financially because I need to be home to take care of my dog which severely limits how much OT I can pick up to make ends meet. I’ve told “E” in the past that it might be a good idea to search for other employment options and his response is “I’m gonna see this job through, and I see it as a lifetime career”. I’m always as accommodating to what he’s doing as I can be so he can try and figure out who he is as a person due to all of his different life plans changing as mentioned prior. However I’m at the point where I want to tell him he needs to get a different job that pays an hourly wage with a part time (or full time honestly) schedule so he actually has a chance at being independent in life as well as honor what he had agreed to when he moved in. I truly care for “E” as a honorary little brother but I don’t think I have the right to tell him what jobs to/ not to work.

23,1e9pyc2,AITA for falling down my friends staircase,"
I (21F) was recently invited to my close friends (20F) new house - student accommodation shared with herself and 3 others.

My friends housemate has an assistant dog (Benji) who is the best boy and is obviously very well behaved. I had only met this furry little guy once but he was working so I didn't interact with him. I also was not aware that this friend of a friend had actually moved in with her.

My friend was giving me a house tour and it was nice, decent house for student accommodation. After showing me the downstairs communal area she wanted to show me her bedroom as she had only just decorated. Her room was alright - a couple of movie posters, mirrorball, a rug here and there. 

However as we are starting to head back downstairs.... the doggo arrived.

Unluckily I lost the genetic bingo and am allergic to dogs .
Looking at the floofy bastards even makes my eyes and nose start to water significantly. Like a niagra falls just appears leaving me looking like a toddler that just been told santa isn't real.

So the golden boy rocks up and I let out the world's most stupendous sneeze, making me slip and fall down the stairs. It honestly sounded like the start of Queen - We Will Rock You.
I was very embarrassed and turned back to my friend, who I thought would be wetting themselves laughing at this point.
But no, she did not find it funny, not a bit.
She shouted and told me that me acting like that would get her kicked out of the house because I was being so loud and obnoxious. I honestly didn't mean to and yes the sneeze was probably a bit loud but it was all so awkward.
I quickly apologised to my friend and thanked her for inviting me round and congratulated her on the move.
I have texted her to apologise again but haven't heard anything for 4 days and her housemate has blocked me on all social media.

What do I do? Surely a sneeze isn't too bad. We have never had any issues or arguments before so maybe I caught her at a bad time??? I just want everyone to be chill again.

24,1e9ps03,AITA for kicking unwanted guests out my dad’s house?,"I (20f) have a dad (64m) who is autistic and a severe insomniac so lives life in a very particular way.

Last year he was put on a medication for depression that did not work for him, and kind of sent him into a downward spiral. He was banned from most of the local bars he frequents, I was getting calls from his sister and friends often, with them expressing worries about his behaviour.

When I came home for the summer things took a turn for the worst. He had been referred to a psychiatric care team who were seriously considering sectioning him involuntarily for a period of time. He had also decided to invite a girl to live with him, someone who worked in a bar he had been banned from. She was 26 and her mum had recently passed away, they didn’t know each other well but he was lonely and offered her a place to crash until she was back on her feet. This though a little odd, seemed fine to me if it was a fairly short-term arrangement.

Regardless, she shortly invited her boyfriend to live there too, 27, who was a pretty scary guy and had a not-so-stellar reputation. Needless to say after a couple months of them staying with my dad, they showed no signs of leaving or looking for jobs. My dad had told me they were not cleaning up after themselves, keeping him up at night and not contributing financially. Despite this he didn’t want to kick them out, which was not surprising as due to his mental state, most decisions he had been making were nonsensical.

I have not lived with my dad for years, because I spent a lot of my childhood looking after him and it was very stressful for me (him and my mother are not together) but i still care about him a lot and was worried about what would happen if this girl and her boyfriend continued to live under his roof. So, I went over there with my brother and had a very polite conversation with them, asking for them to leave within a week, as my dad needed to focus on getting help for himself, BEFORE helping anyone else. They seemed fine with this.

Unfortunately nothing is ever that simple, and they did not leave. They even encouraged him to escape to Turkey as a way of avoiding being sectioned by the psychiatric care team. I tried to call the police and have them removed, but they had no grounds to remove them until my dad had been formally sectioned, which kept getting delayed because there were no beds available. 

I was getting pretty desperate, and my dad had a flight booked. I brought my boyfriend and his Rottweiler, and we went to my dads house while he was outside to take his passport so he couldn’t leave. I also told the girl and her boyfriend that if they didn’t leave my dad’s house by the end of the week, I would make them leave. Aside from this I gave them general crap about taking advantage of a mentally unstable man, which I think was justified. 

I went back to check if they had taken me seriously a few days later, and they were gone. 
",Not the A-hole,2024-07-22,"AITA for kicking unwanted guests out my dad’s house? I (20f) have a dad (64m) who is autistic and a severe insomniac so lives life in a very particular way.

Last year he was put on a medication for depression that did not work for him, and kind of sent him into a downward spiral. He was banned from most of the local bars he frequents, I was getting calls from his sister and friends often, with them expressing worries about his behaviour.

When I came home for the summer things took a turn for the worst. He had been referred to a psychiatric care team who were seriously considering sectioning him involuntarily for a period of time. He had also decided to invite a girl to live with him, someone who worked in a bar he had been banned from. She was 26 and her mum had recently passed away, they didn’t know each other well but he was lonely and offered her a place to crash until she was back on her feet. This though a little odd, seemed fine to me if it was a fairly short-term arrangement.

Regardless, she shortly invited her boyfriend to live there too, 27, who was a pretty scary guy and had a not-so-stellar reputation. Needless to say after a couple months of them staying with my dad, they showed no signs of leaving or looking for jobs. My dad had told me they were not cleaning up after themselves, keeping him up at night and not contributing financially. Despite this he didn’t want to kick them out, which was not surprising as due to his mental state, most decisions he had been making were nonsensical.

I have not lived with my dad for years, because I spent a lot of my childhood looking after him and it was very stressful for me (him and my mother are not together) but i still care about him a lot and was worried about what would happen if this girl and her boyfriend continued to live under his roof. So, I went over there with my brother and had a very polite conversation with them, asking for them to leave within a week, as my dad needed to focus on getting help for himself, BEFORE helping anyone else. They seemed fine with this.

Now I've been clean for 18 months and he has told me numerous times that he's clean from everything. I've found so many pipes, but he always claims he's not using. I'm not stupid.

I stopped having sex with him this month because I dont feel safe with the lying and deception. He agreed to take a drug test the other day but when he handed it to me it was cool, and so fucking clear it looked like it was so watered down.

27,1e9pd7f,AITAH or just paranoid af? ,"AITAH For going through his phone? 

This may be a long one so I’m not quite sure how to start off and whether you guys can offer any insight. 

Me(27f) and my boyfriend (25m) have been dating for nearly 2 years. 

It was quite difficult to begin with because he’s the type to kind of push people away if he finds himself getting happy. But eventually we got into the swing of things, he basically moved in with me and everything has been good. But to preface his background, his parents are strict, he’s always been the “disappointment” of the family compared to his younger brother so rules were always quite strict for him so he turned to substances and alcohol. And this has made him sneaky, he’d lie to his parents about anything and everything and for some reason that includes me now too. 

I’m just needing some advice on whether I am being TA or not.. recently he’s been doing substances a lot more, drinking a lot more, hiding his phone and just being really angry ALL the time.. he lies constantly to make out he’s not doing these substances or lies about where he is or what he’s doing. a couple of months back I had a really bad gut feeling that something wasn’t right. I went through his phone after we got back from a holiday, and didn’t find anything ‘suspicious’ apart from him sending a voice note on SC to a “coworker” that he misses her. He claims to not like this colleague at all. This was whilst we were on our first holiday together as a couple in March. We had a fight about this but eventually he deleted her and me moved on from that. But he’s aware that stuff like that (liking girls photos on instagram, having female colleagues on SC and having their numbers etc makes me uncomfortable and a little insecure) which I understand isn’t 100% his fault. 

Recently the same stuff has been happening again, he’s been deleting messages, saying he’s in places that he’s not, being really distant and again hiding his phone. We had a big fight recently due to him deleting messages from a new coworker because apparently he “didn’t want the aggravation” from it and it ended in us splitting. Because he refused to delete these female colleagues from SC. I said if they were just colleagues then they could be contacted if needed through whatsapp(their main work platform) 
I’ve also had dreams that he’s been cheating on me with some of these people and now my housemate is in these dreams too, she’s single and technically he is single even though we are still talking and seeing how stuff goes. And I keep getting anxiety that maybe they are sleeping together and hiding it from me. I’m really really unsure about what to do, and when he’s angry he’s nasty, he’ll call me names and say that I’ll have a new guy round that evening and then ignores me for hours. 
Am I overthinking stuff the dreams too much? Am I making something out of nothing? Or am I entitled to feel the way I do?

28,1e9p1dn,AITA (16F) for calling my friend (16M) unlovable and not offering a different friend (16F) an apology ,"
I don't really know how to phrase the title, but that's the gist of it.
There's also a third ""plotline"" running along with these two, but that ones resolved so I didn't put it in the title.

This all started last Tuesday, when my friend, let's call her Pearl (16F) got mad at me for saying some knucklehead stuff about my other friend, Emma, wanting a boyfriend when her ex, Rob was there. Pearl is friends with Rob, which is why she got mad at me, because whilst Emma is over the relationship, Rob isn't.
This isn't super integral to the story, but it explains a bit of the stuff later on why she got so mad at me.

The main story is this: Pearl met a guy on Wizz on Wednesday, (this is like a dating app for teens kinda) and only told Emma and this other girl, Hannah about it, saying that they were her ""best friends"" and that she only wanted them to know. At this point her and the guy had been speaking for about 2 days. Emma told me about this boy, because she thought i deserved to know because me and Pearl had also been friends for around 8 months now, and see eachother atleast once a week. We all have a groupchat, and me and Emma were on call on this groupchat with 2 boys, one being Rob and another being this guy called Connor. On this group call Emma told me that Pearl and her wizz lad were going to meet up in town for a cup of tea, to which we were laughing about because it's quite funny if you're a teenager to go and meet a guy you're interested in for tea of all things. Coffee, sure, but not tea. Anyways, she told me that, she never said the boys name (that's important to the story) and that was that.

until, Pearl started spamming Emma for the whole day saying, ""oh why does Connor know this guys name, blah blah blah, why does he know all this, I never told him this, why would you tell him about this after I told you not to tell anyone?""

So, that night, me and Emma made a Groupchat with Connor and Robert asking them why they were telling pearl that we had told them these things, And I'm not gonna lie I can't remember for the life of me what was said because it was on Snapchat and the messages delete after 24 hours, but basically we argued, we asked Connor how he knew the guys name was Tim, because we never mentioned his name, the only Tim we mentioned was some guy we used to be friends with because we found his wizz profile, but yeah we argued and then once we got eachothers perspectives etc we were fine, literally we were just joking around and sending dumb memes and tiktoks to eachother, and we went to bed all being fine with eachother.

Obviously, until Pearl found out what had went on, and me and Emma woke up to a massive text message sent to the both of us. Now, me and my friend Emma got sent different paragraphs from Pearl, and I don't have the one send to Emma so I'll just copy and paste the entire conversation I had with Pearl below.
(I have these ones and not the one from the groupchat because i screenshotted these after she blocked me)


Pearl:
ive already messaged emma, and again, im not attacking you, im explaining the situation. i dont know why you both felt the need to make a gc and argue with connor and rob because its just purely immature. i dont know why you felt like that would make anything better im the friendship group because in fact, its mostly ruined it. calling connor fat was vile and not needed whether it was a ""joke"" or not. it seems that when someone calls you the n word usually it doesnt bother you too much, but now in this time it seems to bother you during an argument and i don't understand why. im not defending whoever said the n word because its not right, but when emma says it its usually fine so whats the difference with connor and rob? i just can't understand why you both felt the need to act immature like that and make a gc as if we are in year 8.

- for context, I am mixed race, my mum's white and my dad's black, and all of my friends are white

Me:
i didnt call connor fat and i never would i called rob fat and it was rob who said the abby davis thing, ANYONE saying the n word bothers me a lot but its not like i can fucking do anything about it, its not like emma or connor or rob would understand why its so annoying and honestly upsetting and its not like i can make them stop because ive told all of them to stop especially emma before and they havent so i just try to not let it bother me, connor saying it bothers me because he used to not say it at all and now for some reason he finds it acceptable to say it all the time, and we needed to make a gc because they had the wrong perceptions of everything and needed to shut the fuck up, and anyways we were fine on the gc after we argued cuz we got each others prerogative and fucking understood why each of us were upset. i do apologize to rob because i said some things abt him involving emma w him not being over it and that was unfair to him.

- context, connor is fat/chubby, whatever you want to call it

also neither of us told the boys about your lad and we especially didnt mention his name, neither of us are that thick

Pearl:
im sorry but you called connor and rob a fat n word for not joining the call or some shit
but again the gc wasnt needed and was immature because you both could've just messaged them instead of ganging up on them

- context, I called them that because they wouldn't play fortnite with me and emma

oh (my name) ive had enough of the lies i dont care i know one of you did tell them
who? i dont know i dont care
they dont just mysteriously know the boys name and that i was going to meet him and have a cup of tea
i literally just told emma and hannah
i didnt even tell you

Me:

why would either of us tell them (the boys) neither me or emma are close with them like you are
all we talked about involving your lad was us laughing about emma saying ""shes meeting him in town for tea"" noone said any names so i dunno how they got a name from that or how or why they thought it was you

- context, i found out later that this was incorrect, emma did infact say pearls name i just forgot

can we just relax about this please we're talking about some lad youve known for three days why is this so serious


Pearl:

there you are then so it was said that i was meeting him

im sorry but thats so disrespectful to say to me right now (my name). that pisses me off. ive already said to emma its not that deep about the boy. its more about the principle of the situation and how she went behind my back and told people after she promised she wouldnt. i dont even owe you that explanation, so do not tell me, how i should be reacting thankyou.

do not disrespect me like that again
fucking not on
im not even that pissed off about the lad, im more pissed off that its taking this long for you both to tell me the truth. i already know the truth, i thought my best mates had enough respect for me to not lie to me?

Me:
fair enough, but the only person that she directly told about it is me, if thats why your mad then thats fair but dont get mad at us for the boys knowing thats not our fault all we said was some vague sentence that connor ended up interpreting correctly, im assuming because you messaged him after the tea and crumpets thing

- context, pearl said something in the groupchat about going somewhere and connor responded with ""tea and crumpets?) 

what fucking truth please
tell me what you want us to admit so i have more of an idea as to what is going through your head


Pearl: 

well theyre not thick are they (my name) , this isnt an excuse either way. you both still said 
it
- context, she's talking about the tea thing, i didnt speak about the tea thing it was emma who told me on the group call

well it is your fault connor said it because he wouldnt of said it if none of you never mentioned shit
(my name) mate, just take responsibility. without you and emma mentioning it, they wouldnt know. its both your fault. take responsibility.

i want you to admit that you both told them
thats fucking it
take responsibility
not oh, no connor just got lucky in guessing
no, connor wouldnt even of guessed if it wasnt mentioned
just take responsibility and not lie its really not rhat hard

Me: 
yeah sorry we talked about it
is that all?

Pearl:
yeah
thanks for your compassionate apology
dont even know why the fuck youre getting angry at me for


Me:

ME
cuz your blowing this way out of the water im sorry the boys know but its not our fault they know his name and whatever else you accused her of in the first place so apologize to her
- context, im talking about emma
u were on her the whole day for something so fucking minor
im sorry for talking about it on a group call we shouldn't have done that



emma showed me what pearl had been messaging her, and i saw a message saying something along the lines of (can't remember exactly) that i was ""scrambling for excuses"" and that my stories didnt line up 
so i sent her this:


Me:

EMMA TOLD ME HIS NAME WAS TIM I NEVER MENTIONED HIS NAME ON THE CALL OR TO THE BOYS THE ONLY TIME I MENTIONED TIM STOKES WAS LAST NIGHT ON THR GC WHEN I SAID THAT WE WERE TALKING ABIUT HIM CUZ ERIN FOUND HIS WIZZ STOP TWISTING MY FUCKING WORDS

- context, we dont know what pearls fellas last name is, tim stokes is that guy we used to be friends with

Pearl:

actually fuck off then
you just dont fucking get it do you
im not twisting shit, im telling you what ive been told so dont you get fucking pissy with me whem youre the one in the wrong

Me: 
then connor needs to shut his fucking mouth and stop speaking up about shit he has no idea about

- context, pearl and connor are good friends and they tell eachother everything

Pearl:
well he clearly does have a fucking idea about it doesnt he
dont get fucking pissy at me

after that i left it alone until like half 8 at night, at which i sent her a massive paragraph trying to explain everything 

Me :

right okay so just to clear things up, all that was said on the call was emma saying ""oh shes meeting that boy off wizz for tea"" then pearl sent tim stokes wizz and they were talking about that on the call, i wasnt on the call when this happened, i never mentioned his name and neither did emma, the only tim we mentioned was tim stokes. connor and rob were being cunts all day to emma, and sorry about the fat n word thing or whatever i said but that was aimed at both of them cuz they were being twats, im sorry connor took personal offense to that i didnt mean it in that way. also, he needs to stop with the n word, he never used to say it but now he says it all the time, and i think that a fucking racial slur is worse than a general insult so please dont say anything about ""you never care when anyone else says it"" i do care but what the fuck am i supposed to do about it? i cant do anything i cant stop someone from saying a word no matter how absolutely disrespectful it is to say it.
i have no idea how its ganging up for 2 girls to add 4 boys to a gc and ask why the fuck they're talking about irrelevent incorrect shit.
also neither of us brought Aaron or tj into it,
connor, rob , aaron and tj were all on call together so they obviously were the ones who got them involved

- context, aaron and tj are our other friends, aaron started messaging emma when he was on call with the other guys and telling her what they were saying because apparently they were talking shit about us saying that we cant get our story straight and that we were clearly making things up

also, why should i be the one to take responsibility when i didnt even fucking do anything. it was emma who said the tea thing and furthermore it was a joke because be so fr thats pretty funny to go meet a lad for tea.
i have no idea what connor has said, or what has been said to connor  but he needs to keep his nose out of things no offense because hes spreading false shit. noone said anything about your tim , also, if you had just denied what connor said, instead of im assuming messaging him, none of this would be happening, you could have just talked to emma about why he knows and this would have been one and done with.
connor has heard and seen the exact same texts and calls as everyone else, i dont know why he is coming up with shit that noone else has heard about.

after this, she left me on opened, and emma said on the groupchat (i cant copy and paste the chats because i don't have screenshots)

""if anyone has anything else to say, say it on here instead of relaying it through pearl""

and we all started arguing again, basically over all of the things me and pearl were arguing about. however, everything could have been fine if we had just communicated and stopped being pricks, which was what me, emma and rob were doing, but connor kept saying that he didnt understand why he couldnt say the n- word (hes white and ginger) and kept on copy pasting this urban dictionary screenshot saying that ""my n-word"" is a person who will be with you thick and thin, ignoring the racial status and context of which that screenshot is obviously meant to be read in. ill put the screenshot that i took below, after this
but yeah, he sent that, i sent the wikipedia definition of the n- word and a link to buy nelson Mandelas autobiography on amazon, and then told him to go read some black history books.
and he sent the fucking urban dictionary screenshot again.
by this point, i had had a shitty day. i went for a day out in chester only to be bombarded with messages from pearl, and getting ""schooled"" on black terms by a welsh white guy who has no respect for other ethnicities. (our town has a 94 percent white population, so understandable) (i moved to here about 3 years ago, before that i lived in Manchester)

so, i was fed up and i wanted to hurt him. im not excusing what i said but yeah

Me: 
this is why (girl) doesn't like you, whilst being a cunt, (her bf) still wouldn't bring up your relationship by making fun of you day after day. this is probably a reason why (his ex) broke up with you, or maybe she made you like this and you still want to impress her because why else would you always go on and on about how much you hate her when it was nothing more than a 2 week relationship. get over yourself please. im sorry this is mean but by fucking god do you need to hear it

so yeah. i was also gonna bring myself into it cuz he used to have a crush on me but i figured that me even saying that to him was enough.

he left the groupchat after i said this btw.

then, pearl texted me, copypasting the thing i said to connor, and said

Pearl :
youre fucking vile

Me:
who cares its the truth, if he didnt want to hear it, he shouldn't have been a cunt
if hes a cunt, ill be a cunt back
feel free to say everything bad about me in turn to my face
this has all been said behind his back, why is it so bad i said it to him
atleast now hes aware

Pearl:
you are being fucking horrible
vile
i hope you are fucking aware of how vile you are being
fucking too far
oh i fucking will you vile bitch
- (responding to ""feel free to say everything bad about me in turn to my face"" 
never fucking talk to me again

Me:
What

Pearl:
you fucking heard

Me: 
read actually 

but yeah sorry but genuinely connor did need to hear that, the (girl) thing and the (his ex) thing were genuine concerns he always brings it up
im sorry for being mean but it was necessary
also im sorry but how the fuck am i the vile one here, youve been accusing me of shit i didnt do, not listening to what ive been saying, connors been twisting my words and saying and calling me racial slurs for fucking however many months and as soon as i call him out on his bullshit about ""oh night shift"" ""oh auschwitz edger"" 

- context, the girl he has a crush on's bf is polish and he plays rust

""cottage cheese mong"" 

- context, his ex previously had a yeast infection 

you call me vile, im not vile im telling him how fucking concerning it is that hes so hung up on girls he has either never had a relationship with or had a relationship with for 2 weeks, if im being serious, i think what i said about rob needing to get over emma is a lot more rude because i didnt need to say that, but obviously you dont care about him as much so you didnt bring it up. connor needed to hear that. probably in nicer terms, ill admit that it was extremely rude, but he did need to hear it.


then she blocked me

and yeah, so you'd think thatd be the end of it right? wrong. so obvs emmas been on my side throughout all this, or moreso ive been on her side because i wouldnt have been in the majority of this argument if emma hadnt spoken about it on the group call to me, and then i decided to defend her, because obviously, shes my friend.

pearl apologized to emma either yesterday or the day before yesterday, saying that she shouldn't have believed connor immediately and should have asked for her perspective, and she should have been nicer.

i didnt get any apology. by this point, ive already apologized to connor and rob for what i said, cuz after i calmed down i realized it was a dickhead move to say something like that, so i sent them both a long paragraph each apologising for what i said. rob accepted it, connor just left me on opened, which is fair considering what i said.

ive found out a few hours ago that all of them went to the park together ( pearl, emma, , connor etc) and emma hasnt said a word to me about it.

the only reason im this deep in shit is because i chose to defend emma and be a good friend.


so, AITA for saying what i said to connor, should i message emma, and should i apologize/ message pearl (she blocked me on Snapchat, i still have her number)?

i just miss my friends man

also sorry if theres any original names in this, all of the fake names start w the same letters as the real names so if theres a C name or an R name etc thats not whats been used for the rest of this story just ignore it, ive tried to proofread the best i can but yeah.

also nvm i wont attach that image cuz it wont let me, also i searched it up on urban dictionary and found out that that image he sent was altered, so not only did he send a fake screenshot he sent it to try and justify a racial slur. joke or not, in that period of time that was the most innapropriate thing he could have done. he could have just said sorry and nothing else would have happened.",TL;DR,2024-07-22,"AITA (16F) for calling my friend (16M) unlovable and not offering a different friend (16F) an apology  
I don't really know how to phrase the title, but that's the gist of it.
There's also a third ""plotline"" running along with these two, but that ones resolved so I didn't put it in the title.

This all started last Tuesday, when my friend, let's call her Pearl (16F) got mad at me for saying some knucklehead stuff about my other friend, Emma, wanting a boyfriend when her ex, Rob was there. Pearl is friends with Rob, which is why she got mad at me, because whilst Emma is over the relationship, Rob isn't.
This isn't super integral to the story, but it explains a bit of the stuff later on why she got so mad at me.

The main story is this: Pearl met a guy on Wizz on Wednesday, (this is like a dating app for teens kinda) and only told Emma and this other girl, Hannah about it, saying that they were her ""best friends"" and that she only wanted them to know. At this point her and the guy had been speaking for about 2 days. Emma told me about this boy, because she thought i deserved to know because me and Pearl had also been friends for around 8 months now, and see eachother atleast once a week. We all have a groupchat, and me and Emma were on call on this groupchat with 2 boys, one being Rob and another being this guy called Connor. On this group call Emma told me that Pearl and her wizz lad were going to meet up in town for a cup of tea, to which we were laughing about because it's quite funny if you're a teenager to go and meet a guy you're interested in for tea of all things. Coffee, sure, but not tea. Anyways, she told me that, she never said the boys name (that's important to the story) and that was that.

until, Pearl started spamming Emma for the whole day saying, ""oh why does Connor know this guys name, blah blah blah, why does he know all this, I never told him this, why would you tell him about this after I told you not to tell anyone?""

So, that night, me and Emma made a Groupchat with Connor and Robert asking them why they were telling pearl that we had told them these things, And I'm not gonna lie I can't remember for the life of me what was said because it was on Snapchat and the messages delete after 24 hours, but basically we argued, we asked Connor how he knew the guys name was Tim, because we never mentioned his name, the only Tim we mentioned was some guy we used to be friends with because we found his wizz profile, but yeah we argued and then once we got eachothers perspectives etc we were fine, literally we were just joking around and sending dumb memes and tiktoks to eachother, and we went to bed all being fine with eachother.

Obviously, until Pearl found out what had went on, and me and Emma woke up to a massive text message sent to the both of us. Now, me and my friend Emma got sent different paragraphs from Pearl, and I don't have the one send to Emma so I'll just copy and paste the entire conversation I had with Pearl below.
(I have these ones and not the one from the groupchat because i screenshotted these after she blocked me)


Pearl:
ive already messaged emma, and again, im not attacking you, im explaining the situation. i dont know why you both felt the need to make a gc and argue with connor and rob because its just purely immature. i dont know why you felt like that would make anything better im the friendship group because in fact, its mostly ruined it. calling connor fat was vile and not needed whether it was a ""joke"" or not. it seems that when someone calls you the n word usually it doesnt bother you too much, but now in this time it seems to bother you during an argument and i don't understand why. im not defending whoever said the n word because its not right, but when emma says it its usually fine so whats the difference with connor and rob? i just can't understand why you both felt the need to act immature like that and make a gc as if we are in year 8.

- for context, I am mixed race, my mum's white and my dad's black, and all of my friends are white

Me:
i didnt call connor fat and i never would i called rob fat and it was rob who said the abby davis thing, ANYONE saying the n word bothers me a lot but its not like i can fucking do anything about it, its not like emma or connor or rob would understand why its so annoying and honestly upsetting and its not like i can make them stop because ive told all of them to stop especially emma before and they havent so i just try to not let it bother me, connor saying it bothers me because he used to not say it at all and now for some reason he finds it acceptable to say it all the time, and we needed to make a gc because they had the wrong perceptions of everything and needed to shut the fuck up, and anyways we were fine on the gc after we argued cuz we got each others prerogative and fucking understood why each of us were upset. i do apologize to rob because i said some things abt him involving emma w him not being over it and that was unfair to him.

- context, connor is fat/chubby, whatever you want to call it

also neither of us told the boys about your lad and we especially didnt mention his name, neither of us are that thick

Pearl:
im sorry but you called connor and rob a fat n word for not joining the call or some shit
but again the gc wasnt needed and was immature because you both could've just messaged them instead of ganging up on them

- context, I called them that because they wouldn't play fortnite with me and emma

oh (my name) ive had enough of the lies i dont care i know one of you did tell them
who? i dont know i dont care
they dont just mysteriously know the boys name and that i was going to meet him and have a cup of tea
i literally just told emma and hannah
i didnt even tell you

Me:

why would either of us tell them (the boys) neither me or emma are close with them like you are
all we talked about involving your lad was us laughing about emma saying ""shes meeting him in town for tea"" noone said any names so i dunno how they got a name from that or how or why they thought it was you

- context, i found out later that this was incorrect, emma did infact say pearls name i just forgot

can we just relax about this please we're talking about some lad youve known for three days why is this so serious


Pearl:

there you are then so it was said that i was meeting him

im sorry but thats so disrespectful to say to me right now (my name). that pisses me off. ive already said to emma its not that deep about the boy. its more about the principle of the situation and how she went behind my back and told people after she promised she wouldnt. i dont even owe you that explanation, so do not tell me, how i should be reacting thankyou.

do not disrespect me like that again
fucking not on
im not even that pissed off about the lad, im more pissed off that its taking this long for you both to tell me the truth. i already know the truth, i thought my best mates had enough respect for me to not lie to me?

Me:
fair enough, but the only person that she directly told about it is me, if thats why your mad then thats fair but dont get mad at us for the boys knowing thats not our fault all we said was some vague sentence that connor ended up interpreting correctly, im assuming because you messaged him after the tea and crumpets thing

- context, pearl said something in the groupchat about going somewhere and connor responded with ""tea and crumpets?) 

what fucking truth please
tell me what you want us to admit so i have more of an idea as to what is going through your head


Pearl: 

well theyre not thick are they (my name) , this isnt an excuse either way. you both still said 
it
- context, she's talking about the tea thing, i didnt speak about the tea thing it was emma who told me on the group call

well it is your fault connor said it because he wouldnt of said it if none of you never mentioned shit
(my name) mate, just take responsibility. without you and emma mentioning it, they wouldnt know. its both your fault. take responsibility.

i want you to admit that you both told them
thats fucking it
take responsibility
not oh, no connor just got lucky in guessing
no, connor wouldnt even of guessed if it wasnt mentioned
just take responsibility and not lie its really not rhat hard

Me: 
yeah sorry we talked about it
is that all?

Pearl:
yeah
thanks for your compassionate apology
dont even know why the fuck youre getting angry at me for


Me:

ME
cuz your blowing this way out of the water im sorry the boys know but its not our fault they know his name and whatever else you accused her of in the first place so apologize to her
- context, im talking about emma
u were on her the whole day for something so fucking minor
im sorry for talking about it on a group call we shouldn't have done that



emma showed me what pearl had been messaging her, and i saw a message saying something along the lines of (can't remember exactly) that i was ""scrambling for excuses"" and that my stories didnt line up 
so i sent her this:


Me:

EMMA TOLD ME HIS NAME WAS TIM I NEVER MENTIONED HIS NAME ON THE CALL OR TO THE BOYS THE ONLY TIME I MENTIONED TIM STOKES WAS LAST NIGHT ON THR GC WHEN I SAID THAT WE WERE TALKING ABIUT HIM CUZ ERIN FOUND HIS WIZZ STOP TWISTING MY FUCKING WORDS

- context, we dont know what pearls fellas last name is, tim stokes is that guy we used to be friends with

Pearl:

actually fuck off then
you just dont fucking get it do you
im not twisting shit, im telling you what ive been told so dont you get fucking pissy with me whem youre the one in the wrong

Me: 
then connor needs to shut his fucking mouth and stop speaking up about shit he has no idea about

- context, pearl and connor are good friends and they tell eachother everything

Pearl:
well he clearly does have a fucking idea about it doesnt he
dont get fucking pissy at me

after that i left it alone until like half 8 at night, at which i sent her a massive paragraph trying to explain everything 

Me :

right okay so just to clear things up, all that was said on the call was emma saying ""oh shes meeting that boy off wizz for tea"" then pearl sent tim stokes wizz and they were talking about that on the call, i wasnt on the call when this happened, i never mentioned his name and neither did emma, the only tim we mentioned was tim stokes. connor and rob were being cunts all day to emma, and sorry about the fat n word thing or whatever i said but that was aimed at both of them cuz they were being twats, im sorry connor took personal offense to that i didnt mean it in that way. also, he needs to stop with the n word, he never used to say it but now he says it all the time, and i think that a fucking racial slur is worse than a general insult so please dont say anything about ""you never care when anyone else says it"" i do care but what the fuck am i supposed to do about it? i cant do anything i cant stop someone from saying a word no matter how absolutely disrespectful it is to say it.
i have no idea how its ganging up for 2 girls to add 4 boys to a gc and ask why the fuck they're talking about irrelevent incorrect shit.
also neither of us brought Aaron or tj into it,
connor, rob , aaron and tj were all on call together so they obviously were the ones who got them involved

- context, aaron and tj are our other friends, aaron started messaging emma when he was on call with the other guys and telling her what they were saying because apparently they were talking shit about us saying that we cant get our story straight and that we were clearly making things up

also, why should i be the one to take responsibility when i didnt even fucking do anything. it was emma who said the tea thing and furthermore it was a joke because be so fr thats pretty funny to go meet a lad for tea.
i have no idea what connor has said, or what has been said to connor  but he needs to keep his nose out of things no offense because hes spreading false shit. noone said anything about your tim , also, if you had just denied what connor said, instead of im assuming messaging him, none of this would be happening, you could have just talked to emma about why he knows and this would have been one and done with.
connor has heard and seen the exact same texts and calls as everyone else, i dont know why he is coming up with shit that noone else has heard about.

after this, she left me on opened, and emma said on the groupchat (i cant copy and paste the chats because i don't have screenshots)

""if anyone has anything else to say, say it on here instead of relaying it through pearl""

and we all started arguing again, basically over all of the things me and pearl were arguing about. however, everything could have been fine if we had just communicated and stopped being pricks, which was what me, emma and rob were doing, but connor kept saying that he didnt understand why he couldnt say the n- word (hes white and ginger) and kept on copy pasting this urban dictionary screenshot saying that ""my n-word"" is a person who will be with you thick and thin, ignoring the racial status and context of which that screenshot is obviously meant to be read in. ill put the screenshot that i took below, after this
but yeah, he sent that, i sent the wikipedia definition of the n- word and a link to buy nelson Mandelas autobiography on amazon, and then told him to go read some black history books.
and he sent the fucking urban dictionary screenshot again.
by this point, i had had a shitty day. i went for a day out in chester only to be bombarded with messages from pearl, and getting ""schooled"" on black terms by a welsh white guy who has no respect for other ethnicities. (our town has a 94 percent white population, so understandable) (i moved to here about 3 years ago, before that i lived in Manchester)

so, i was fed up and i wanted to hurt him. im not excusing what i said but yeah

Me: 
this is why (girl) doesn't like you, whilst being a cunt, (her bf) still wouldn't bring up your relationship by making fun of you day after day. this is probably a reason why (his ex) broke up with you, or maybe she made you like this and you still want to impress her because why else would you always go on and on about how much you hate her when it was nothing more than a 2 week relationship. get over yourself please. im sorry this is mean but by fucking god do you need to hear it

so yeah. i was also gonna bring myself into it cuz he used to have a crush on me but i figured that me even saying that to him was enough.

he left the groupchat after i said this btw.

then, pearl texted me, copypasting the thing i said to connor, and said

Pearl :
youre fucking vile

Me:
who cares its the truth, if he didnt want to hear it, he shouldn't have been a cunt
if hes a cunt, ill be a cunt back
feel free to say everything bad about me in turn to my face
this has all been said behind his back, why is it so bad i said it to him
atleast now hes aware

Pearl:
you are being fucking horrible
vile
i hope you are fucking aware of how vile you are being
fucking too far
oh i fucking will you vile bitch
- (responding to ""feel free to say everything bad about me in turn to my face"" 
never fucking talk to me again

Me:
What

Pearl:
you fucking heard

Me: 
read actually 

but yeah sorry but genuinely connor did need to hear that, the (girl) thing and the (his ex) thing were genuine concerns he always brings it up
im sorry for being mean but it was necessary
also im sorry but how the fuck am i the vile one here, youve been accusing me of shit i didnt do, not listening to what ive been saying, connors been twisting my words and saying and calling me racial slurs for fucking however many months and as soon as i call him out on his bullshit about ""oh night shift"" ""oh auschwitz edger"" 

- context, the girl he has a crush on's bf is polish and he plays rust

""cottage cheese mong"" 

- context, his ex previously had a yeast infection 

you call me vile, im not vile im telling him how fucking concerning it is that hes so hung up on girls he has either never had a relationship with or had a relationship with for 2 weeks, if im being serious, i think what i said about rob needing to get over emma is a lot more rude because i didnt need to say that, but obviously you dont care about him as much so you didnt bring it up. connor needed to hear that. probably in nicer terms, ill admit that it was extremely rude, but he did need to hear it.


then she blocked me

and yeah, so you'd think thatd be the end of it right? wrong. so obvs emmas been on my side throughout all this, or moreso ive been on her side because i wouldnt have been in the majority of this argument if emma hadnt spoken about it on the group call to me, and then i decided to defend her, because obviously, shes my friend.

She said they are engaged, so her girlfriend is basically family whether others like it or not.

32,1e9oe7g,AITA for the way I(F24) talked to my father(M56)?,"I am doing my masters and was looking for a full time job after I finish my studies. My father one day came into my room and connected me with someone who works in one of the best companies. This was a few months ago when I applied my resume. A week or so after, they called and asked when am I going to finish my masters and I told them in September. So they said they can't take me now but that I should reapply a couple of months before my graduation.

My cousin also works at this company and told me a couple of weeks ago that they stopped accepting people for the time being. Two days ago, I was looking at their job openings and it looked like they started opening the jobs that I could apply to. I honestly then forgot about it as I am still working on my masters project and talking to my supervisor.

Now, my father tells me happily that my cousin told him that they reopened job applications. I nod and tell him I saw they did two days ago. He initially laughs and asks me why I didn't tell him. Then he asks, still jokingly but somewhat serious, 'You don't want to apply, do you?' I sighed and said 'God help me' (which is a phrase I say a lot) cuz I've heard this before and I have to explain myself again which is something I don't think I am good at cuz I don't feel as if people understand me after I try to put my thoughts and intentions into words. My father still somewhat jokingly says 'You always say that. Like God help me with these children, right?' This triggered me cuz he is assuming what I mean again. I hate when people assume my intentions, especially since I am a very straightforward person.

This is where I may have messed up. I raise my voice slightly when I feel like I am not being heard, so I did that and said 'No that is not what I mean. It is just that whenever I say something, I feel like you guys don't believe me so yes I am asking God to help me.' Then I continued 'I do want to apply but I just need the right time...I have a lot of stuff...' I basically fumbled and then gave up and said 'Okay, fine. I don't want to apply.' My father just walked away and then turned to me and told me 'I won't ever talk to you or discuss stuff with you. You have been saying some stuff that are not right to your mother and me lately.' I immediately told him 'No, discuss stuff with me. But believe what I say to you.' To which he says 'We believe you. So why didn't you tell me about the job opening?' So I said 'I forgot about it.' And he finally walks away while saying 'Fine.'

During this whole argument, my voice was raised and his wasn't but he clearly was upset. Also, I know he will talk to me and discuss stuff with me again, he just said he won't because he was upset. Another thing is, recently, when I feel like I won't be able to explain my intention well, I just sarcastically agree to whatever the person is saying about me; so that is what my father is referring to I guess.

My cousin also works at this company and told me a couple of weeks ago that they stopped accepting people for the time being. Two days ago, I was looking at their job openings and it looked like they started opening the jobs that I could apply to. I honestly then forgot about it as I am still working on my masters project and talking to my supervisor.

Now, my father tells me happily that my cousin told him that they reopened job applications. I nod and tell him I saw they did two days ago. He initially laughs and asks me why I didn't tell him. Then he asks, still jokingly but somewhat serious, 'You don't want to apply, do you?' I sighed and said 'God help me' (which is a phrase I say a lot) cuz I've heard this before and I have to explain myself again which is something I don't think I am good at cuz I don't feel as if people understand me after I try to put my thoughts and intentions into words. My father still somewhat jokingly says 'You always say that. Like God help me with these children, right?' This triggered me cuz he is assuming what I mean again. I hate when people assume my intentions, especially since I am a very straightforward person.

This is where I may have messed up. I raise my voice slightly when I feel like I am not being heard, so I did that and said 'No that is not what I mean. It is just that whenever I say something, I feel like you guys don't believe me so yes I am asking God to help me.' Then I continued 'I do want to apply but I just need the right time...I have a lot of stuff...' I basically fumbled and then gave up and said 'Okay, fine. I don't want to apply.' My father just walked away and then turned to me and told me 'I won't ever talk to you or discuss stuff with you. You have been saying some stuff that are not right to your mother and me lately.' I immediately told him 'No, discuss stuff with me. But believe what I say to you.' To which he says 'We believe you. So why didn't you tell me about the job opening?' So I said 'I forgot about it.' And he finally walks away while saying 'Fine.'

During this whole argument, my voice was raised and his wasn't but he clearly was upset. Also, I know he will talk to me and discuss stuff with me again, he just said he won't because he was upset. Another thing is, recently, when I feel like I won't be able to explain my intention well, I just sarcastically agree to whatever the person is saying about me; so that is what my father is referring to I guess.

33,1e9o85s,WIBTA for lashing out at my little cousin? ,"(I’m a teenager. My little cousin is 8. Aunt is 30 something, mom is 46.)

my little cousin has been taking my things since he was 3, at first I thought it was okay because it was just little trinkets or scrap paper. As he’s gotten older he’s begun to take more valuable things and his mom (my aunt) does nothing. He’s taken my money, learnt my safe code, literally took one of my pillows, a stuffed animal with my dead cats fur, and other items. I can’t get them back. I have a great bond with my aunt and I dont wanna break our relationship, but I’m getting tired of crying because my little cousin decided He suddenly wants my childhood plushie. today I told my mom about it and she didn’t give a shit and just said “you can talk to your aunt about it” (which I have, multiple times but she just plays it off) i literally wanna go into his room and take all my stuff back but I know my aunt would say I need to share. i feel like there’s a big difference between letting my cousin use my things or play with stuff at my house than him literally taking it to his house and me not getting it back.  So main question here, would I be the asshole for yelling at my aunt about enabling this and/or going to my cousins room and taking all my stuff back.

34,1e9nzz6,AITA for not cancelling on the guy I’m dating?,"
So I just got in a huge fight with my best friend of 10 years. Let’s call her C. We’re both 20f.

C is back home for the summer. When she first got here, I had just gotten dumped by my first bf and I was in a horrible state. I took out a lot of my pain on the people closest to me, including her. I have apologized profusely for how I acted. I thought I had gotten myself together, healed, made it up to the people I was an ass to, and started seeing the good parts of life again. I got some new work opportunities, got really into exercising, quit vaping and smoking, and was really proud of myself. Then about a month ago I met a guy, J. I was 2 months post breakup and we are taking things slow. With my work schedule, and J working opposite hours than me during the week, it’s been hard for us to see each other. 

This past weekend C and I decided we definitely needed to spend some time together. We do have a road trip planned in 2 weeks, but still. I wanted to delegate time for C and time for J this past weekend. The plan was to see C Friday night and Saturday during the day, then see J Saturday night. C said she had plans with a friend Saturday night so I thought it would all work out! 

It was Friday night and C says she’s not feeling great, I understood and said that we could still spend Saturday during the day together. She then tells me she’d like to also spend Sat night together. I said, well I have plans with J, and I thought you also had plans? She then said I should cancel on J and spend all of Saturday with her. I explained that I really wanted to see both of them, but it turned into a huge thing. C said that I’m overly attached to J, that I’m “desperate” to see him, and that the only reason I’m happy again is because I have guy in my life giving me male validation. That all I care about is him and that I’m prioritizing him over her. From my perspective this is not the case at all! Me and C could still spend Saturday during the day together and then I would see J Saturday night. It then further escalated, with C saying that she’s lost so much respect for me since the moment she got home, that I’ve changed. I understand that I WAS an asshole when I was fresh out of my breakup, but I thought things were ok now and that she’d accepted my apologies, I didn’t know there were issues and that she saw me in such a different light. All of this really hurt to hear, especially coming from my best friend of 10 years. C asked for space so we haven’t spoken in a few days. I don’t want to lose her, but Im really hurt by all these things she said. 

I wanted a balance of seeing my best friend and J. I didn’t see it as ditching her, like she says I am, nor did I see it as prioritizing him over her. I don’t know what’s gonna happen from here, and we have this trip planned together.

36,1e9npjl,WIBTA if I email my boss that I was in hospital,"Four weeks ago I (36m) I went to my GP Friday afternoon, the doctor was stumped and booked me in for 9am Monday at the SDEC unit at hospital. I rang work and spoke to the owner of the company (65ish f) I told her I had just come out of the doctor's and they wanted me to go to the hospital first thing Monday and I was sorry, I would come in after, but with it being the hospital it might be a few hours. She said it was fine, she was happy I was finally getting help, she would cover for me Monday morning and told me not to worry too much, because they aren't sending an ambulance to take me there right now.

It gets to 12:30 Monday afternoon and they are talking about sending me to get an x-ray and stuff which is when I realise it will be all day. I ring the office, speak to my assistant and tell her I'm probably not going to be able to come in. I went in Tuesday and I got told off for not telling anyone about Monday, apparently she was under the impression that I was going to the doctor's. I mentioned that she said something about the ambulance and she was adamant that she had never said it. I spoke to a few other employees and they all have their own stories about her not remembering stuff, getting told off for stuff she told them to do or to leave for her to do. It does seem like she has a bit of a memory issue.

Today, I thought I had a heart attack this morning 4am, I convinced myself I was ok to go into work. I lasted until 10am and felt a lot worse and called an ambulance.

38,1e9n1zj,AITA for not allowing my brother to store things in my house?,"
I moved next door to my older brother and his wife a year ago. We get along great so i wasn’t concerned. When I first moved here, my brother was excited because it has a four stall garage in the backyard in addition to a tight-fit two stall garage attached to the house. My brother and parents made plans for it assuming I wouldn’t need it. He parks his car in the front garage which I said was fine at first. 

Shortly after I moved in, my brother moved a bunch of stuff into the garage. Mind you, my brother has a one stall garage and two sheds of his own. I was slightly annoyed, but let it go because I didn’t need the space. I’ve been trying to live by the motto “don’t sweat the small stuff.” Over the last year, more junk has accumulated in the garage. He also has put things in my front garage and basement.

A few months ago, my boyfriend moved in. He expresses frustration with my brother storing items all over my property. He said if he wants to purchase a boat or camper, it would be frustrating to have the room to store it and not be able to due to the space being full of my brothers things. 

I’ve been decluttering my own things in my house lately. I worry that by allowing my brother to store things here when his property is already completely filled with stuff is enabling his hoarding habits. 

Last week, my brother showed up at my house with two boxes he had and asked to store them in my attic. I currently having nothing in my attic, and I said no because I don’t want anything in the attic. He seemed disappointed but took the rejection well and left.

This past weekend, my BF and I came home to my brother emptying his things out of my back garage and into his sheds. He said he is purchasing a third shed for his bigger items. I could tell he was upset, but him and his wife both insisted he was fine and wouldn’t explain what was going on. I finally pried out of his wife that this had all been triggered by me saying no to the boxes, and my brother was hurt and wanted nothing at my house at all anymore (there’s still items in the front garage and basement). 

My SIL is on his side, and when i asked if the roles were reversed if she thinks he would be fine with me storing stuff at his house, she said yes he would be (this would never happen because there’s no room). My mom is on my brothers side despite recently decluttering her own home. My brother and I’s mutual friends are on his side as well (though I don’t know what they’re been told).

Although our group of 4 “split up” (Sarah and Lucas go to different high school) we still remain really close and hang out frequently. But I’ve recently noticed that they changed and not for good.

When we were in elementary school we shared a mutual opinion about our ex-classmates, they were racist and often spat out unacceptable remarks. We always had a problem with them and for a good reason, I haven’t changed my opinion. 

Year ago though Sarah mentioned that saying the N-word is “fun”, and it really weirded me out, so i obviously called her out for it. She basically said that i’m making a big deal out of it and that she’s not racist it’s just fun to say, which i still think it’s weird. 

Now year later it’s her daily vocabulary and Lucas and Dave, who’s basically like a brother to me, also take part in it. They say jokes, that are in my opinion really weird ( FYI we’re all white in a country filled with racism ).

Of course kids wanted the excitement of a pet but not the responsibility. So really it fell on me and my husband to care for the dog. Occasionally step son would take the dog to the bathroom. I can count on one hand how many baths stepson has given the dog in the last 4 years. Never took her for a walk. He did name her though. 

Current situation. My husband and I separated in March of 2023 and he kicked me out. I could not take the dog immediately since I didn’t have proper housing. When I did get my own house 3 weeks after he kicked me out, I asked for the dog and he said no because the dog belonged to him. 

In May/June of 2024 husband went out of town for work and left the dog in the care of my stepson who is 15. Stepson decided to go stay at his aunts- which I’m supportive of. I don’t think he’s old enough to be on his own like that for weeks on end. Aunt did not want the dog at her house. So I picked the dog up. 

The dog was clearly neglected. Fleas, body sores, could see her ribs, gunky buildup and what looked like mold in her fur. Bald patches in fur from her chewing on herself. Her nails were long and starting to curl under her paws. Her paw pads were cracked and bleeding. She smelled horrible. I did not take any pictures to prove neglect-which is my mistake. 

I’ve had the dog since June 19 2024. She’s doing good. Her fur has grown back and not a flea in site. She’s a happy girl.

Here’s my problem: husband moved states and told me to keep the dog. There are no official papers on the dog. No records to speak of. My sister in law has legal and physical custody of stepson- she told me to keep the dog. Stepson is moving in with other family members and he wants the dog. Claims the dog is his. I told him I’m not giving the dog up to be neglected again. His other aunt whom I’ve never met or talked to has reached out saying she’ll take care of the dog. 

So. WIBTA to keep the dog?

41,1e9mq3r,AITA for going against my parents wishes?,"I (18f) grew up in a family of 6 kids. I am the youngest with a five year age gap with my next sibling. All my life, I’ve done my best to be as self sufficient as I could so my parents don’t have to worry. This has lead to me having to take me hits for “the team” in things I want. In my senior year, I was gifted a puppy, let’s call him toast. I have always had a busy schedule, but have managed things sucefully to care for toast. Physically, emotionally, and most importantly financially. He is now a year and a half, and I have yet to ask my parents for financial aid regarding the dog. 

The problem comes in at college. I was meant attend university this coming year for an affordable price that my college fund could cover. However, my brother(26M) found himself in legal trouble and my parents had to pay for a lawyer. The money for said lawyer coming from my college fund. My parents have asked me to simply attend a community college. I, begrudgingly, agreed. After this, it made me realize, that my sibling have been causing trouble all their life, yet I’m always forced to pay for their mistakes. And so, I made a decision. 

I brought a dog. 

A 4 month puppy who my older dog loves. However, my parents are unhappy. Stating we can’t afford a dog at the moment. However I disagree, due to one factor. THEY have never afforded anything. I have. I pay for the expenses of Toast in every aspect, to where they don’t have to do anything. And I intend the same with this new puppy. I will pay for the dogs every expense, like I always have. However, my parents want to give him to a shelter. But I want to keep him. I am sick of taking hits for the team at the expense of my own happiness. Personally, I’m done. Am I the A hole? 

edit: I’m sorry I was so unclear in this post. I did ask to foster the dog, which we are. He’s a foster in our home. I completely forgot to mention that. The problem is coming about mentioning keeping the dog. But my parents knew he was coming and know he’s there. He sits on the couch in my dad’s arms when he rubs his belly. I’m not crazy, I wouldn’t bring a dog unannounced. What I meant by behind their backs is that I was already talking to the person with the dog before they said yes. But he was approved to be in my house. My bad I explained that pretty poorly. ",Asshole,2024-07-22,"AITA for going against my parents wishes? I (18f) grew up in a family of 6 kids.

Gran has not celebrated her birthday for several years following my gramps passing away, and she has been really down and sad about things. This year, however, she has started to feel better, so my cousin feels like it’s the right time to throw her a surprise party.
The whole family have been invited, as well as some of my gran’s friends. As far as I’m aware, I will be the only person in the family not attending.

The issue is that I had a massive fallout with my cousin around the time that my gramps passed away. I won’t go into details about what happened, but I will say that I will never forgive my cousin for the things that they did and said, and I am very much at peace with the fact that I will never speak to them again.
The party is at this cousin’s house, so there would be no avoiding them - and I have no desire to set foot in their house or be anywhere near them or their partner, who I also dislike.

This birthday party invitation might be an olive branch from the cousin, but I am not interested in making amends, nor am I emotionally able to pretend to like them, even just for a few hours. (I have ASD, so that doesn’t come naturally to me).

I feel like if I went to the birthday party, there would be an awkward atmosphere between my cousin and I, and that wouldn’t be fair to my gran on her special day.

I will take gran out for a meal 1-1 to celebrate her birthday, however I know that I will be called an asshole by the family for not attending the party,

We all contribute equally to our monthly ""house food"" (food meant for everyone, not one specific person) budget. We can still have our own food, and as long as we communicate so nobody eats someone else's food.

A couple weeks ago, I made myself and E some spaghetti with the house food. Just noodles and generic brand canned sauce, nothing fancy. Quick and easy because I was feeling lazy. A was at work until late that night, and myself and my gf ended up finishing all the spaghetti. When A came home, she saw the dirty pot in the sink and made a comment about being sad there was none saved for her. I asked if she wanted me save some for her next time I made it, but she didn't really give me a straight answer. I got the feeling she wanted me to though, so I made a mental note to do that next time I made spaghetti and moved on.

A few days later, I made some pork chops. Again, nothing fancy. E wasn't hungry and didn't eat her portion, so I offered it to A when she came home. She accepted, however when she put the food in the microwave to warm it she made a face as the smell hit her. She tried not to let me see, but I could tell she wasn't thrilled. She took the food into her room to eat, which isn't unusual for her, so I don't know if she finished it or what.

Since then, whenever we're in the kitchen together and I'm cooking, she's been kind of hovering over my shoulder and trying to give me advice on how to season my food. And honestly, sometimes it's good advice. I'm one of those people who views cooking as a constant learning thing, so I don't mind taking suggestions. However, she gave me an attitude whenever I didn't do something how she wanted or liked. It was always subtle and unspoken, until yesterday.

I was making spaghetti again. When I make spaghetti, I keep the noodles and sauce separate, so everyone can choose how much sauce they want. A's seen me make spaghetti before, but this time she said I made it ""the white people way."" I feel it is important to note that she is also white. She said I should mix the sauce in, and I told her that wasn't how I make it. She told me that she liked it better when it was pre-mixed, and here's where I maybe went too far. I told her I don't care how she likes it, because I wasn't cooking it for her. I told her that when I cook, mine and my gf's preferences are the only things I consider, because the food is being made for us, not for her. If she doesn't like it, she has her own food to make, and there is nothing stopping her from eating that.

She got all huffy and stormed off, and later on E said my tone came off a bit angry. I wasn't angry, I was just stating a fact, but maybe there was a way to put it more gently? I don't know. I'm told that I can sometimes come off as an asshole without meaning to, that I have one of those resting faces that makes me look angry all the time even when I'm not. So AITA?

We go over every 2 weeks for supper just to maintain their ""relationship"" but the conversation is so dry and we show up at dinner and leave shortly after. This is his choice due to his past with his parents he does not want a close relationship.

Last Sunday: The Future FIL went away on a trip. MIL was home alone. We went over for dinner on the Sunday. FH & I had already discussed that I was planning to have dinner with my sister on Wednesday who was down for the week (as my bridal shower was the coming weekend). Sunday dinner conversation was dry and non existent as usual. She then mentions she wants to come see the new grass seed we planted for the wedding/driveway we have added gravel to. I thought this was weird but whatever. MIL stated she could come over Wednesday to see the landscaping. FH stated he would let her know. MIL stated she could come for supper. FH stated he would let her know. MIL stated she would bring supper. FH stated he would let her know. Anyways long story short, FH cancelled on her and stated Wednesday wouldn't work for us.

Yesterday: It was my bridal shower.  I started opening gifts. During the opening of gifts, FMIL walks up to gift table and says she wants to give me ""this one"" personally. Whatever, I think maybe it is something sentimental with a backstory. Anyways I open her first gift it is a stovetop tea kettle. She then COMES UP with her other gift. I open it. It is instant coffee. She then loudly proclaims to basically everyone she has never met before ""Now you have no excuse to not have me over!"" I stare at my bridal party but keep a straight face and continue. Later on my FH shows up at the end of the bridal party. As soon as he walks in the door before he can even talk to ME she tells him to come over to her. He doesn't like being put on the spot and this was not the place for this. And she tells him she is coming over on Tuesday. He then says that probably would work. She said she has a massage at 6pm, so would be coming at 7:30pm. He again said that might work and he would let her know.

Anyways, I overhear this conversation and go outside with the FH to load up the gifts. I stated rather harshly he should have spoken to me before agreeing to have his mom over. He very bluntly says ""You've made the whole day about yourself not everything is about you."" I end up crying in the bathroom with my sister.

We get home we get right into an argument. I explain how FMIL is too pushy about coming over, I am a very private person, I don't have friends over and rarely my own family and her comments today were uncalled for and embarrassing. FH doesn't believe she made that comment. I said it was not me who lied to her last week about being available and had to cancel on her. How he should have spoken to me before agreeing to have her over to our home. FH gets furious with me suddenly and states ""So I am not allowed to have my own mother in my own house!?"". I said ""You aren't close with your parents, you don't even want to have a dance with your mother at our wedding, how do you expect me to be close to people you aren't close with either?"" We spoke things out, how things made us feel today etc. I agreed to have the FMIL over as cancelling twice would just rude, but stated it cannot happen again, and for next time say we have to discuss things together first. I then ask what the plan is for Tuesday. He tells me she is coming over for SUPPER.. He never mentioned this to me the entire time. She has never been here for supper.

46,1e9m7mv,AITA for not inviting my friends to my birthday party?,"Last night was my birthday, but we had to drive home from vacation, so I ended up celebrating with my friends today. Unfortunately, my friend group recently had a falling out, splitting into two groups. Let’s call them Group A and Group B. There’s also a third friend who is sort of in between the two groups.

Group A consists of two close friends I go to college with and hang out with frequently. Group B is made up of four friends, including one I’ve known since I was three years old.

Recently, a text chain revealed that Group A had unfollowed everyone in Group B on social media. Group B found out and started making fun of them. The friend who is in between both groups defended Group A in the group chat and later shared the conversation with me and a couple of other friends. Since then, this in-between friend has distanced themselves from Group B.

One of the friends from Group A asked if I wanted to do something for my birthday, and we agreed to hang out later this week since she was on vacation. Meanwhile, Group B decided to celebrate my birthday tonight, and I went along since I was just getting back from vacation and was looking forward to seeing friends after being gone for a week. 

The next morning, the friend from Group A reached out, upset that she and her roommate weren’t invited to the party. I explained that I didn’t invite them because she was out of the country and I didn’t think her roommate would want to go since they’re not friends with Group B. She mentioned that it would have been nice to get an invite anyway and that she planned to invite everyone from both groups to hang out later in the week.

I apologized and explained it was a miscommunication. She expressed that she feels she goes out of her way to include me in things at school and that it doesn’t go both ways. I reiterated that it was a misunderstanding and apologized again.

For additional context, my friend groups have had some tension lately due to the social media unfollowing incident, and I wasn’t sure how to navigate the situation without causing more drama. I genuinely didn’t think inviting Group A while they were on vacation would make sense, especially given the recent fallout.

Last night was my birthday, but we had to drive home from vacation, so I ended up celebrating with my friends today. Unfortunately, my friend group recently had a falling out, splitting into two groups. Let’s call them Group A and Group B. There’s also a third friend who is sort of in between the two groups.

Group A consists of two close friends I go to college with and hang out with frequently. Group B is made up of four friends, including one I’ve known since I was three years old.

Recently, a text chain revealed that Group A had unfollowed everyone in Group B on social media. Group B found out and started making fun of them. The friend who is in between both groups defended Group A in the group chat and later shared the conversation with me and a couple of other friends. Since then, this in-between friend has distanced themselves from Group B.

One of the friends from Group A asked if I wanted to do something for my birthday, and we agreed to hang out later this week since she was on vacation. Meanwhile, Group B decided to celebrate my birthday tonight, and I went along since I was just getting back from vacation and was looking forward to seeing friends after being gone for a week. 

The next morning, the friend from Group A reached out, upset that she and her roommate weren’t invited to the party. I explained that I didn’t invite them because she was out of the country and I didn’t think her roommate would want to go since they’re not friends with Group B. She mentioned that it would have been nice to get an invite anyway and that she planned to invite everyone from both groups to hang out later in the week.

I apologized and explained it was a miscommunication. She expressed that she feels she goes out of her way to include me in things at school and that it doesn’t go both ways. I reiterated that it was a misunderstanding and apologized again.

For additional context, my friend groups have had some tension lately due to the social media unfollowing incident, and I wasn’t sure how to navigate the situation without causing more drama. I genuinely didn’t think inviting Group A while they were on vacation would make sense, especially given the recent fallout.

47,1e9m3sb,AITA: my husband chose not to get the day off for our daughters Baptism,"This is a long one. I (31f) and my husband (34m) have been planning and planning on baptizing our daughter along with my sisters son, who we would be the god parents to. My sister told me if my husband could get the day off for July 14th, and I said yes I’m sure he can, We had enough time for him to ask.We also had a couple of other events before the baptism date. 
•July 2nd was my brothers 1 year anniversary date of this death. So we had a whole day planned out for him. 
 •July 4th he originally had the day off but said he wanted to work because they get an extra bonus (he’s salary they don’t get overtime just on some holidays) to which I said okay 
•July 6th his company had an event planned at a baseball game and we HAD to go
•July 12th was his company Management Dinner so of course we had to attend that as well.  

When my sister had brought up the baptism date it was barely June. So when I would ask my husband about it like hey ask for the 14th of July off for the baptism he would just say okay. June is flying by and it’s getting close to the last week of June and this time I talked with him sternly and asked about the date and he said “I can’t ask for it off, it’s too close to ask for it now” and I think I short circuited for a good minute. 
I told my sister my Husband says he “can’t get the day off” is there anyway we can push it back?? And she says she had already gotten their vacation days in order and couldn’t change them. 
I begged my husband if he could ask to come in 2 hours later. He was on nights at the time and his shift started at 4:30pm. He said he didn’t want to ask because he didn’t want to beg his boss. I told him this is your daughters BAPTISM. It’s only once in her life and it’s very important for me and for her. He still said no. 

So we had to plan it out anyway. The Mass was at 2:30pm and husband worked at 4:30pm. The Mass ended at 4:10, there was 10 babies so it took a little longer. Well my husband was already super anxious to leave, but I made us take family pictures together since a lot of our families were there. He ended up just texting the 1st shift supervisor he was going to be a little late and that was it. It wasn’t even made out to be a big deal. 
My husband went to work and me and the kids went to my parents house where we had a small celebration with food and cake. 
A little time passed on I brought it up to him that I was still upset he didn’t try to get the day off or ask to come in later for our daughters baptism. I told him that for his work related things he makes an extraordinary effort but for his family events he doesn’t try. And his response was well those events put food of the table, I have to show face. And YES I understand but to an extent. He literally told me he didn’t want to beg his bosses just to come in 2 hours later. And it ended with that, no apology no nothing just that I was overreacting. I honestly feel like I’m just being gaslit and made out to be the bad guy.

49,1e9lvfy,AITA For Asking Roommate to Leave the Room to Work Past Midnight?,"I (20F) am doing a research program at a university this summer. My roommate (19F) and I are friends and plan to room together in the fall. We agree to both turn out all lights if one of us wants to go to bed early and the other is staying up. We've been doing this, except she keeps her laptop at full brightness when she stays up, so for the past week I haven't been able to get good sleep, just because lately I've been having headaches and my eyes have been more light-sensitive.

I'm a really light sleeper and after a certain time, it's hard for me to fall asleep successfully, and it takes me until 2AM to do so. Since our REU is ending in a few days, I haven't gotten an eye mask/melatonin or made purchases of that sort since I don't want Amazon to ship my package and not be able to get it on time. I've made do with a DIY sleeping mask with my t-shirt, but it hasn't been effective.

I'm aware this sounds needy, so I communicated these issues to her but clearly stated that I'd get a good eye mask (and melatonin) for the fall so that this wouldn't be an issue. I only asked if we could try to either both sleep at 11:30 at night, or if we could leave the room when working past midnight- just for the next 2 nights.

I made it clear that I didn't want to be a helicopter roommate who needed control of the room long-term, just an arrangement for the next 2 nights so that I could recover from the week of shitty sleep.

She told me that she'd try her best but since she was working on a project with tight deadlines, it was unlikely. She's also said she hates going outside to work after showering/changing into PJ's, and likes being cozy when working. I know that we all have responsibilities and shit to get done, but I am a bit upset at her insistence on staying in bed instead of leaving the room when staying up late to do work.

Most of all, I made it clear that I didn't want to be controlling, but that I just needed this favor for the next 2 nights. Sometimes she asks if we can go to bed by a certain time and I'm always ready for lights' out (no laptop) by that time, and if I have to stay up, I leave the room. Other time she requests a certain bedtime and then doesn't abide by it. AITA for asking for this favor and being upset? And would it be AH behavior for me to ask her again if she could leave the room if she was up past 12 tonight?

Edit: We have a really nice common area and multiple study rooms in the dorm that we're in. And there's not a lot of students here over the summer so the areas are insanely quiet. I don't expect her to study in the common areas during the school year (especially since staying cozy and in the room seems important to her), and it gets pretty loud and rowdy, but I'd just appreciate 2 days this summer where she could step out (into a quiet area) if working past midnight and I could get good sleep. 

To the people leaving constructive suggestions- thanks guys. But the uni's also remotely located, so an Uber (Target's route is cheapest) could be up to $30-40 round-trip (I'm on a pretty tight budget), and I don't have a car. I've looked into taking the bus to go to Target, but my lab has kept me overtime (in addition to my 9-5) these last 2 weeks and I usually get out at 6:30, making it hard to get back before dark (the area with Target and other convenience stores is high crime so I'd like to avoid that). And I leave before the weekend, so going during the weekend when there's more flexibility is out of bounds too. The pharmacy/student union is pretty understocked since it's the summer and sleeping masks/melatonin aren't 'essentials' by any means and were out of both when I checked this morning, but I'll go back tomorrow to see.

50,1e9lsz6,WIBTA for not giving my friends number to a woman I just made out with?,"The other night I (M30) went to a bar to play pool with my best bud (Joe, M30). As we're playing, a woman (F35, Rachel) comes up and asks if she can play doubles on the next game with her friend. When they join, she immediately starts flirting very hard with both of us, and vice versa. At some point, I pull Joe aside and have the ""let's decide who will make the move later"" convo, and he says I should go for it. We spend the next hour all flirting, and when we plan to leave I ask for her number and she gives it to me.

Then Rachel suggests we all go back to her place a few blocks away for a nightcap, which we agree to. While there, Rachels friend maneuvers so Rachel and I have a little time to ourselves, we make out, it's great, she's really into it lots of laughter and hungry looks, appropriate for a first time. When we go back outside, she immediately starts flirting with Joe again. I'm not going to lie, it felt a little shitty to have her flirt with the only other dude there literally 10 seconds after we made out (not to mention my best friend), but I figured it just might be my own insecurity. Soon after, Joe and I leave.

Now here's the thing. Rachel and I have texted a few times since then, and in every single message she sends, she asks about Joe. First one was asking for both our last names, which definitely felt like she was hoping to look him up and go around me to hook up with my friend. At this point I'm considering blocking her and moving on. If genders were reversed and a woman friend told a story about making out with a guy at a bar and then he kept asking about her other friend, he would get called a sleazebag.

51,1e9lruz,AITA for texting my best friend’s husband?,"Alyssa & I (both 26F) met when we were high school freshmen & have been friends since.

Junior year, Alyssa’s mom got sick & her dad was always busy so my family took her in. Before her mom passed, she asked me to take care of Alyssa & I promised I would. This promise led to years of being walked over by my “best friend”.

Over the years, she would hurt me but I would always forgive & make excuses for her. During uni, I went through a traumatic experience that broke me, and when I needed her most, she texted me saying that “she can’t deal with the drama & needs to focus on herself.” Her response broke what’s left of me so I cut her off. During this time, she started dating a guy & got married during the pandemic.

2 years ago, she reached out on Instagram to reconnect. I was still hurt, but I remembered my promise to her mom, so I agreed to meet for one reason only — to make sure she married a good man.

When we met, she apologised for her message from years back & updated me on her life. The guy she married, James (26M) seemed decent & his family were genuinely good people. In the following months, I got to know James & his family and they’ve gotten to know mine. I treated James the way I would treat a BIL & we became good friends bc we knew it made Alyssa happy.

Fast forward 2 more years, my husband & I got married, Alyssa was my MOH, and our husbands got along well. A few months ago my husband & I were going through a rough patch and separated. Her & James were supportive, but the day I told them about the separation, James’ uncle passed away. This, however, didn’t stop them from spreading the news about my separation to everyone in his family.

2 weeks later, hubby & I make up but I’m still at my parents house. Alyssa came over and told my mom & I that she’s worried about James since he was close to his uncle who passed. That night, she sent a video of James and he looked horrible. His face was sunken & he looked like he lost weight.

Not thinking much of it, I texted James the next day “take care of yourself bud, your wife is worried about you” which he blew into “I feel attacked & if she’s worried she should be telling me”.

I told him it’s no big deal & that she probably just doesn’t want to worry him. He said he understood & left it there. That night, Alyssa texted me saying that “I crossed a boundary by telling James something she told me in confidence” so again I told her I just saw the video & wanted to reach out. I also told her it would’ve been inappropriate if I said “I’m worried about you” which is why I said “your wife is worried about you”.

I still apologised & told her I truly didn’t realise the boundary existed. She said it’s okay & ended it there but we haven’t talked since.

52,1e9lm5p,AITA for arguing with my best friend after she ditched me for her boyfriend?,"Throwaway bc she follows my other account & I need advice.

I (21f) have been best friends with (we'll call her Sarah) (19f) for 8 years in September. We grew up in similar neighbourhoods & went to the same school, albeit different years.

She moved away to uni and I often visited her to stay over. Then she met her BF (let's call him Sam: 19m)

At first, she included me in everything they did and made an effort to talk to us both so neither of us were ignored in favour of the other.

Now: the problem.

Since I've known her, she's been bad at money management. Getting as much as she can & spending it almost immediately. I go to university in London, and she's about 20 mins away on the train (which costs less than £10) but regularly tells me she ""doesn't have enough money to meet me"" but then she'll go out with Sam somewhere expensive.

The first few times, I wrote it off.

But then she started including her uni friends (again, I wrote it off for the first few times, but she'd lie to me & do something else anyway)

I live at home & go to uni, and she only ever makes an effort to see me when she's home.

I'm studying media production, but because I live at home, I can't ask my uni friends to help: as they're all in London. So, I ask my local friends.

I asked Sarah to help a while ago & she agreed.

Yesterday, we went out to Spoons for some drinks. I asked her today if she was still on for tomorow (our filming day) and she said ""yes but only till 2 bc I'm going to London""

We start filming at 1:30. She arranged to go into London, with no money (so she says) when she was drunk. With other friends.


For double context as to why I'm mad. I've got a huge gig coming up in August & invited her. She gets a free ticket & a free hotel room & my mum is making us T-shirts so we don't spend loads. But when I asked her to pay for the taxi to the hotel, she said: ""idk, I won't have money, so lemme ask my mom""

53,1e9li46,AITA for yelling at a couple of boys at the fair and did I have a Karen moment? ,"Hi reddit, 

I (31f) Had a moment at the fair this week and realized after that I may have been a Karen.

I took my toddler (3m) to enjoy the fair with some friends and their toddler. They wanted to go into one of the young kid play mazes that has a couple small obstacles such as punching bag maze, rope climb, and 2 swinging bridges before ending in a slide back to the ground. A sign at the entrance lists the rules such as no rough housing, swinging on the bridge excessively,  etc. I went in with my toddler since he is still young and gets scared in some high places. 

He and I were both doing great until we hit the 2nd & last bridge. We were a little over half way across when it started swinging back and forth pretty violently. My toddler froze from fear and kept saying he couldn't do it. I was starting to feel a bit scared as well as I have a shaky faith in fair rides/ attractions. I tried not to think about the bridge breaking and him and I both falling and being unable to protect him. I tried to reassure him that it was just a bit farther but he wasn't budging. I waited a moment thinking the swinging would pass, but then I looked behind us past our friend and her toddler, and saw two young boys (probably 9-12yo) purposely swinging the bridge back and forth with their full body weight.

I snapped, my deep mom voice came out and I yelled once at them to stop. One boy did but the other stared me down and kept shaking the bridge. I stared back and yelled if they wanted to move forward they need to stop because we aren't able to move until they do. He didn't completely stop but he lessened the intensity enough for my toddler to start walking again and he made it off the bridge.

After we made it out and safely on the ground I started to feel bad about yelling at the boys. I think my own fear probably made it feel worse and more dangerous than it actually was and I overreacted. Especially because I didn't know the boys and it wasn't my place to yell at them. I wish I had been thinking clearly in the moment and tried to ask them to please wait until the toddlers were off the bridge. AITA and a Karen?

54,1e9la26,AITA for getting irritated?,"So I (21f) live in an apartment where the rent is $1k a month along with additional charges such as utilities and parking. I currently live in a four bedroom and have one roommate (22f), we will call her Kayla. When I first moved in I noticed how much the front door was left unlocked along with the common area light and TV being left on throughout the night. I was always taught to turn things off if you’re not going to be in the vicinity or using that item anymore. So whenever I’m done in the kitchen or leave a room period, I usually turn the light off.

Noticing this, I immediately texted in our group chat (at the time we had another roommate but they have moved out) asking if they could please lock the doors, turn off the lights and TV off when they’re done with it, mainly referring to Kayla as she’s the one who does it. 

As the months go by, Kayla has gotten better with turning the light off at night but sometimes she’ll start leaving it on throughout the night and day. It’ll stay on if I don’t turn it off sometimes. She said she leaves it on because she’s scared of the dark but when it’s off she uses the flashlight on her phone to go turn it on so why can’t she do the same with turning it off? Am I being insensitive? 

Anyways, maybe I’m irritated because I started to resent her a bit for other things.

 We can't look out at the front of our house or go out the door without seeing the vehicle directly at the door. This just feels really inconsiderate of them.

I don't want to be liable for something like that. I've honestly been tempted to park my vehicle where I don't want the man to park, but I feel this is too passive-aggressive.

 Here’s what happened.

He came over 3 days ago bragging about how he was working doubles at both his jobs all week. Then last night he called us asking for us to bring him a sandwich because he was working late. 

We told him we were in bed and asked him if his wife could bring him food. He said she wasn’t doing anything but he didn’t want her driving his new truck. We offered a car the whole family uses and he refused. We told him the app has delivery but he didn’t want to pay the $8 fee. He said never mind and ended the conversation with us.

Then he calls him mother 40 times in a row(he hasn’t talked to her in 5 months) and says “I can’t believe they won’t bring me food I thought we were good”, good for him means you do whatever he wants. 

“I cant believe they want my pregnant wife to bring me food”, his wife works 2 jobs, drives herself everywhere, goes to parties and works-out, plus one job is as a waitress, so she can bring strangers food but not her husband? He never mentioned ANYTHING about her being pregnant as a reason, just that he was terrified she would scratch his truck.

His mom called us and tried to get us to bring him food and we again refused(interesting fact up until he got married his mom would still cut up his food)

My argument is 1. He knew he was going to be at work so plan ahead and pack your food. 2. He drove between his 2 jobs and passed dozens of places to pick up food and chose not to. 3. His wife could have brought him food, why call us(if we ask him for anything he expects to be paid exorbitantly or he refuses) 4. The app has delivery just pay the $8 fee rather than expect us to come out for free! 

My spouse is feeling guilty and it does make us look bad because he goes around telling everyone how he only had crackers and no one would help him.

58,1e9kqpk,AITA for prioritizing my sister over my girlfriend?,"
I am the oldest of three kids: I'm 26, my brother is 25, and my sister is 9. Our father, who was in the army, passed away 2 months ago, and our mother died a few years back. My brother and I have always spoiled my sister, and we share a huge bond. When I moved out for university, my sister was very sad. The following year, my brother joined me, which had a huge impact on her. We kept in touch through daily video calls.

After graduating last year, I started a good-paying job and met my girlfriend. We hit it off, and shortly after, we became a couple. My sister liked her. 

When our father died, my brother and I decided that I would take custody of my sister and bring her to live with us in France. She speaks French and attends a French private school, so the transition was smooth. I moved to a bigger house so she could have her own bedroom and bathroom. 

My girlfriend said she supported me, but yesterday she asked me to move my sister to live with my brother. She didn't want to act like a mother figure, which I understand. i  just wanted them to have a healthy, caring relationship since they are both important in my life. I always make sure my sister is taken care of and comes to me for anything. My brother and I handle all her needs, so I’m not leaving any responsibilities for my girlfriend. She said that we're not spending much time together alone, that she want us to be free, travel and enjoy our relationship. I told her that my sister is not going anywhere and if she wanted to leave, that was fine. She asked if i am breaking up with her, but i didn't answer. I left the restaurant, and she went to her friend's place. I haven't texted her or reached out.

Today, I woke up to a lot of messages from her friends and her sister, calling me a horrible person, that i should prioritizes my girlfriend. I don’t know what she told them, and I didn’t reply.
I just shut down my phone and focused on work. 

To clarify something, there is no way i move my sister to my brother's place. 
And i do spend time with my girlfriend but of course since my sister came, i had to spend more time with her, to make sure she is happy. After all grown people can be destroyed by parents death, and my sister is only 9 and she already lost both parents. 

And if anyone say i dont love my girlfriend , i really do love her. She is my first real relationship. 

I think i should've discuss and explain more with my girlfriend instead of just saying 1 phrase which is let's brake up if you can't accept my sister living with me. My brother said that he understand me and support me but if he was in my place, he would have done it differently.

I went from a whole 160lbs to 130lbs then immediately dropped to 118lbs when I had an injury and got covid. I just recently started gaining weight randomly after staying so little for so long and decided to start working out to lose some weight due to worrying I’d get to 160 again. My roommate knows this, we’ve spoken about it. Today, I was visibly upset because I haven’t made much progress at all, so she asked and I told her. Keep in mind i’m 5’7 and 139lbs right now, she is 5’9 at 170lbs. I told her why i was upset saying i’m doing everything, working out, eating in a calorie deficit and even stopped late night snacking. She asked “why are you so worried about your weight anyway?” so I told her i didn’t wanna be overweight again, which then turned into her getting mad at me saying I was being mean to her and calling her fat when those words never left my mouth. I love her dearly but I can’t discuss anything about this event without her getting mad at me for wanting to be more fit. So AITA for not considering how talking about my body made her mad?

63,1e9jqkz,AITA If I am a bridesmaid and not paying for the bridal shower.,"My friend had her bridal shower a few weeks ago. I attended, brought her gifts and help with setup/clean up. There was no prior discussion of who would be paying for the bridal shower. I assumed her parents had paid for it. But then a few days ago, the maid of honor texted requesting $85 be sent to her from each of us bridesmaids. I was NOT under the impression that I would be paying for this! I could scrounge up the cash if I really had to, but I just attended this bride's bachelorette party and spent close to $600 on it between travel, food, hotel, etc. Which is fine because we discussed budgets beforehand and agreed to send the maid of honor money for groceries and decorations.

64,1e9jley,AITA for buying my mom desserts ,"A few days ago, I (24F) and my brother (21M) drove 1½ hours to go to a bakery-cafe with my sister (44F). My mom (63F) gave me cash to pay; however, my older sister decided to treat us. 

At the end of the meal, I used the cash ($9) Mom gave me to buy her two desserts. I texted her before hand to tell her I was getting the desserts. 



When I called Mom before leaving, she got incredibly upset for several reasons. 

1) it was incredibly rude to buy something after being treated. Especially since we're struggling with money. I shouldn't act like I treated her when it's her money. 

2) the desserts spent several hours in a car, and would be melted when they got home. When I said that I could get ice from a gas station, she said that was more money being wasted. Especially, if I had the foresight to bring a cooler instead. To be fair, it was raining so it was only 78° outside. And I figured that food could stay out for 4 hours before being refrigerated. 

3) she didn't like the bakery we went to, but she didn't tell us because she didn't want to spoil it for us. 

4) I should have called her to ask, rather than texting her since she doesn't get texts right away. I didn't call because I felt uncomfortable calling in a public cafe. 

5) she's been feeling sick and hasn't eaten desserts for a while, and I should have noticed that. 

6) I called her on speakerphone when I and my brother were in the car, and she was upset because she thought my older sister heard what she was saying. She was accidentally rude to my older brother's wife when she didn't know she was on speakerphone. And I gave the impression that my older sister was with us. 

7) It shows a pattern of a consistent lack of consideration. 



I just thought I was being nice since I've heard her complain about not getting her something if I decide to eat at a cafe. I only got a coffee drink at the cafe, so I didn't think I was stretching her generosity. 

To be fair, I ended up eating the desserts instead, and I got major diarrhea afterwards. My mom probably would have fared worse if she did end up eating them. If I used common sense, I wouldn't have ended up buying those desserts. But I didn't think she'd get so mad about it.

67,1e9j8n4,WIBTA if I switch my roommate's cats?,"Throwaway account. I live in a 2 bedroom apartment with 3 other people. Roomie 1 has their own room. Roomies 2 and 3 share the master bedroom and bathroom. Roomie 2 has two cats, roomie 3 has one. I sleep in a sectioned off area of the living room and share a bathroom with roomie 1. The living room is attached to the kitchen and front door.

Roomie 3's cat stays in the master bedroom and bathroom with them. Roomie 2's cats stay in the living room with me because Roomie 3's cat will attack them on sight. Roomie 3 takes good care of him and he's otherwise well behaved.

Roomie 2's cats are different. One of them won't stop getting into my things and peeing on them. She'll open my drawers and use them as a litterbox. Same with my laundry hampers and bed. I had to sleep on the floor a lot and do twice as much laundry unless I wanted to smell it on me.

The other one tries to escape. We can only open windows a little because he'll tear through the screen. He has to be held or locked up when people enter or leave. He recently figured out he can reach and turn the front door handle, which auto unlocks from the inside. We've had to barricade the door to stop him. When he can't escape he meows until he loses his voice. It's loud enough to be heard from every room. Both cats also jump on the kitchen counter and will lick residue off of dirty dishes in the sink and steal food as it's being eaten.

Roomie 2 doesn't care. They don't feed their cats or clean the box regularly. I usually end up refilling and cleaning their water dish. They have also haven't helped me clean or pay for the measures I've  taken to keep my things from being ruined.

I've had to buy a tarp for my bed, lidded hampers, and babyproof things for every cabinet and drawer I own. They've worked so far but sometimes I forget the tarp and have to sleep on the floor again while the cleaning solution and de odorizer soak in. I dont know how to deal with the loud one. He gets put in the bathroom sometimes but escapes when someone uses it. We also don't have a more permanent solution for the front door.

I've asked about taking steps to socialize the cats with so they can freely traverse the rooms and I can have a break. Roomie 1 thinks it's a good idea. Roomies 2 and 3 want to keep them completely seperate. Roomie 3 doesn't want their cat to become stressed and start peeing on things. Roomie 2 said it would take too long and they don't have time. They also don't want their things peed on. Both have said it's probably too late to socialize them anyway, so they'll leave things as they are.

hello everyone,

I'm 24 female, I just graduated uni last year and I'm very lucky that my parents paid for my degree. 
still needed to loan money because I had to live and couldn't work enough to survive on my salary alone. 
FYI my parents paid around 12k euros to put my trough uni. 

lately my friends and a coworker started saying that i'm to privileged and spoiled and to ""lose"" that title I need to pay my parents back the same that I need to pay the government for those student debt. 
I don't think this is necessary because my parent chose to pay for me and my brother. ( so also no favorism) but this made those people even more mad and saying that i'm spoiled for thinking so and that i'm a horrible daughter for not paying my parents back. 
because my parents suffer from it,  there words not mine, and for my knowledge my parents are completely fine, they just bought a new house ( and not because they couldn't afford the other one) 
this might sound spoiled, but it is just to paint the picture for u guys.

72,1e9h7xw,AITA for opening my (M28) girlfriend's (F27) gift that she did not want to open?,"EDIT: I know this post is still getting a lot of comments but I posted an update [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/throwraomt/comments/1ea7jyj/update_aita_for_opening_my_m28_girlfriends_f27/)

My girlfriend recently had a birthday. We had a small get together at our apartment but my girlfriend feels uncomfortable opening gifts in front of people because of the pressure and all of our friends know that. She opened them privately that evening.

Two days later my parents' gift arrived. My parents are on the wealthy side and bought her a designer handbag she had been openly admiring the last time we visited. They had purchased the bag that weekend and had been saving it for her birthday. She responded a thank you before she opened it and ""would let them know"" when she did. The box sat on our dresser for about two days before my parents sent a text wondering if she had opened it yet. I asked her when she would open the gift and she just shrugged and said ""soon"". I was also really excited to see her open this gift, I knew that it was something she really wanted.

A few more days passed, my parents checked in again about whether she had opened the gift. At this point, my girlfriend came to me and asked if I could tell my parents to back off, as she was feeling too much pressure around opening the gift and it was making her not want to open it. I admit that I have never really understood this, and I told her that I didn't get why she wouldn't open it. My parents weren't there and all it would require is a thank you text at the very least to acknowledge it. To me, it was the exact same as our friends leaving the party before opening her gifts. She got really frustrated with me and said ""you just don't get how uncomfortable it makes me"".

About a week after the gift arrived, my parents texted me outside of our group chat and asked if she liked the bag. I told them she still had not opened the gift. They asked me if they had made her uncomfortable, if they had overstepped in any way or something. They've gotten her gifts before that have never gone over like this, I truly did not understand why she was not opening it, and at this point I thought it was border line rude to not open it and acknowledge the gift.

She went out with her friends yesterday evening and I opened the box for her, displayed the bag on the dresser so that the pressure of opening it was removed and we could just move on. I really thought I was doing her a favor and ending this awkward situation. When she got home and saw it she was pissed. She said she had guessed it was the bag she had wanted and felt awkward knowing it was an expensive gift and that she did not feel comfortable opening it yet. I tried to explain that she was being a bit rude putting it off, but she said it was more rude of me to open it for her. We went to bed shortly after and she was very short with me this morning. The bag is still sitting on the dresser where I left it.

So, AITA?

My girlfriend recently had a birthday. We had a small get together at our apartment but my girlfriend feels uncomfortable opening gifts in front of people because of the pressure and all of our friends know that. She opened them privately that evening.

Two days later my parents' gift arrived. My parents are on the wealthy side and bought her a designer handbag she had been openly admiring the last time we visited. They had purchased the bag that weekend and had been saving it for her birthday. She responded a thank you before she opened it and ""would let them know"" when she did. The box sat on our dresser for about two days before my parents sent a text wondering if she had opened it yet. I asked her when she would open the gift and she just shrugged and said ""soon"". I was also really excited to see her open this gift, I knew that it was something she really wanted.

A few more days passed, my parents checked in again about whether she had opened the gift. At this point, my girlfriend came to me and asked if I could tell my parents to back off, as she was feeling too much pressure around opening the gift and it was making her not want to open it. I admit that I have never really understood this, and I told her that I didn't get why she wouldn't open it. My parents weren't there and all it would require is a thank you text at the very least to acknowledge it. To me, it was the exact same as our friends leaving the party before opening her gifts. She got really frustrated with me and said ""you just don't get how uncomfortable it makes me"".

About a week after the gift arrived, my parents texted me outside of our group chat and asked if she liked the bag. I told them she still had not opened the gift. They asked me if they had made her uncomfortable, if they had overstepped in any way or something. They've gotten her gifts before that have never gone over like this, I truly did not understand why she was not opening it, and at this point I thought it was border line rude to not open it and acknowledge the gift.

74,1e9gmf8,AITA for yelling at a stranger to leash their dog,"Normally don’t post on Reddit, but I’m livid right now. And I want to know if I’m the asshole or not.

Some context. About a year and a half ago, I adopted a dog. He’s a rescue, and as such initially came with issues. He had been in a no-kill shelter for two years before he was initially adopted by a foster. The foster — a colleague of mine — was going to return him to the shelter, when I offered to adopt him.

Because my dog was in the shelter for so long, he has some issues. One is with men. The past year, he’s been trained out of the issues with men, and people often remark on how sweet, nice, etc. he is with them. 

The second issue is with other dogs. I’ve trained him to not pull when other dogs are nearby. I keep him on lead at all times outdoors, cross the street when other dogs are nearby on walks, etc.. 

Ok, that’s the context — now the event. I was passing through Vermont this morning, and took my dog for a walk. My dog was on lead. When walking on the sidewalk back through town to my motel, another dog wandered out from behind a building across the street to my left — off lead, and no owner in sight. He was coming straight towards us. I pulled my dog towards me, and held his head, while the other dog sniffed him. My dog got upset, and snapped at the other dog. Thankfully my dog just got me instead, though he broke my skin. I’m holding my dog by the collar the whole time.

At this point, I’m in pain, and pissed. The dog’s owner comes out from his house, which turns out to the house on my right. He recalls his dog, and I — angrily — tell him that my dog isn’t friendly and he’s got to keep his dog on a leash. Instead of apologizing, he says that this is his property — his dog approached me *from the other side of the street* on the sidewalk in front his house, apparently. I expected an apology, so at this point I’m extra pissed. I tell him something like ‘Oh yeah, this is your property? Where’s the fence? And your dog came from across the f*ing street!’ He gives me a look, and I just walk away. At some point in the conversation, I called him an asshole. It was all kind of a blur.

I’m still fuming an hour later, and feel like I’m not in the wrong. But given my dog’s issues, I  don’t know. And I’m not from Vermont, so I especially don’t know — and understand there might just be leashless dog-norms in this town I’m not aware of.

75,1e9gi8y,AITA because I wouldn't let my sisters boyfriend use my car?,"I live in a family of 4. I live at home with my bro and my mum and we share 2 cars between the 3 of us, my sister moved out and has her own car. Both of our two cars I feel are predominantly owned by my brother and mother and that if it all three of us absolutely needed a car and couldn't give each other lifts then I would be the unlucky one and have to uber etc

Recently, my brother has been overseas along with my mother, I went and visited my mother overseas. In this time away, we have agreed as a favour to let my sisters boyfriend use one of our two cars (brothers predominant one) as it'll help him get to and from work and obviously other errands as well, she obviously has her own car which she lends to her boyfriend every now and then if he didn't have access to one of ours

I arrive back early morning and my house is far from the airport, I work that day and might need to save time as a drive would take me probably 45 minutes whereas public transport would take me about 2 hour. I asked my sister if she can tell her boyfriend to leave the car at a train station near the airport and I can drive home with it as I have some errands to do before I get to work that I'd prefer to do on the way home from the airport then on the way to work. My sister basically said that she doesn't think I need two cars when her boyfriend would need one and offered to get me an uber home from the airport and also about how her boyfriend sold his scooter so is now finding it hard to get to and from work which also inconveniences her now as they share her car more frequently (I personally don't realise why it's my problem that he sold his scooter as he sold it before we even offered to let him borrow our car so they would've been prepared to deal with this inconvenience, regardless) , I decided it wasn't worth the argument so I thanked her for the uber offer but decided that I'll just get public transport home and drive to work. However, after I said this to her in the family group chat I wrote another message saying that, I feel it's one of our cars (Mum, brother, me) at the end of the day, even if we had 20 cars at home I should still be able to ask for that car back.

She said ""Wow so you'd have two cars and I have 0 (none of which you bought)"", I felt this was pretty unfair as she still has her car so it's not 0, she didn't buy her car either. My feelings to this matter mainly stem from my belief that for something family owned, whether that be a car or something else, that the usage of that ownership should be prioritised by the family members within, and not members outside of the family. Not that I would, but I feel if I wanted the car back because I like sitting in it and looking at the rear view mirror for 10 seconds a day, (you get the point), that even if I had another 50 cars in my garage my sister and her boyfriend should return the car without argument nor debate.

I’ve been here for four years after leaving a rental property and over the times I’ve moved back in, I’ve found it to be pleasant for the most part.  

The one thing that has always come up that really upsets me is that things get thrown out without my knowledge. It’s obvious the stuff is mine, and it’s clear that my mum’s policy on this is that I won’t miss it because I don’t go looking for it. 

When I was young, she used to do this with clothing she thought was inappropriate (fair enough, my dad used to buy us some really inappropriate things when we were with him), but now I’m older this has extended to throwing out my shakes, clothing, food- all of which I’ve paid for with my own money. 

Today it’s come to a head because I’ve noticed that the bottle washers that I’ve had have been thrown out. When I asked my mum she said she threw them out because she’s constantly finding them- admittedly there were more than we needed but she decided to throw them all alway instead of keeping one or two, again without even talking to me. 

For me, I feel like I’m still being treated like a kid and it upsets me that this keeps happening and I then have to spend the money on replacing things. The shakes she threw out a few months ago she thought didn’t cost much but they did. She offered to pay for replacements and when I told her how much they were, she expected them to be no more than £10 so she wasn’t willing to put any more than that towards it. She still hasn’t sent this money across and honestly I’m not gonna fight for £10. It’s the principle of throwing someone else’s things away without consultation that gets to me every time. 

I am not in a position to move out and genuinely this only comes to a head once every 3-6 months when I’ve discovered something is missing but it just feels disrespectful to not even text me before (if I’m not around) to come to some kind of agreement. 

I asked today why it’s always my stuff she throws out and I got a response taking the piss out of me saying yes it always your stuff I throw away poor you. Her husband does find she throws things away of his but it doesn’t seem to wind him up like it does with me. I asked once again to have some communication before things get thrown because it’s obvious when it’s my stuff and I got the husband saying that they ‘need a lot from me too’ to basically shut me down, he did not expand and I walked away because he doesn’t tend to get involved so when he does I can see it’s getting to him, I don’t want it to blow up but I also don’t want to keep finding that I’m missing stuff and have to pay for it all over again.

I am not in a position to move out and genuinely this only comes to a head once every 3-6 months when I’ve discovered something is missing but it just feels disrespectful to not even text me before (if I’m not around) to come to some kind of agreement. 

I asked today why it’s always my stuff she throws out and I got a response taking the piss out of me saying yes it always your stuff I throw away poor you. Her husband does find she throws things away of his but it doesn’t seem to wind him up like it does with me. I asked once again to have some communication before things get thrown because it’s obvious when it’s my stuff and I got the husband saying that they ‘need a lot from me too’ to basically shut me down, he did not expand and I walked away because he doesn’t tend to get involved so when he does I can see it’s getting to him, I don’t want it to blow up but I also don’t want to keep finding that I’m missing stuff and have to pay for it all over again.

So am I the arsehole in this situation? Should I just STFU?",1.0,0.014017172157764435,0,0
79,1e9eh4d,AITA for not doing more to help my homeless dad?,"While my dad wasn’t a great husband  I guess he had some moments as a dad, with me and my full brothers, at least. He was married 2x before my mom, with 4 kids between the 2,  and abandoned them early on. He had a habit of leaving the current wife for a younger model. He cheated on my mom several times that I know of with her almost divorced him one of the early times, but didn’t, feeling it was best for my brothers and I for her not to (and probably also because he was all she knew) my dad was 31  when he met my mom when she was 16, I never really sat down and thought about that until recently, that my mom was most definitely groomed, and how that adds to my dads persona. 

He was always one to stretch the truth trying to seem more grandiose and made a lot of big promises that he didn’t follow through on. But he was more or less there growing up. He took me to Pop Warner cheer and seemed to take pride in it, he was the main bread winner for the first 2/3 of their 30 year marriage. He didn’t do much else, and thinking back what he did do was more for himself. 

2.5 years ago I was living in the other half of my moms duplex and came across my dad. He was pissed at my mom and said how she was going to mess things up. That he got her a really nice gift and had to move some money around to do it and  she was going to ruin it. I asked him what he was talking about and he showed me a picture of a diamond ring. Said he bought her a new one bc she had lost hers while doing yard work and it never turned up. At this point my mom was the main breadwinner, after he unexpectedly retired early about 10 years prior, and my mom was doing really well for herself in her career. It all went downhill from there. The ring was actually for someone he thought he was starting a new life with, but was actually just a scam artist. He sent thousands of dollars to them over the span of months. 

My parents quickly got divorced but my mom let him stay in the house for several months until she had the money from a refinance to pay out the settlement. While he knew it was coming he didn’t have a place lined up and blew through the money in a decently expensive hotel. Started dating a woman my age, only reached out when he needed something and put in no effort to keep in contact with my brothers or I. Fast forward to today, he’s made one bad decision after the other. 

While he gets $2100 a month from SS, we have no idea where it’s going. He totaled the $5000 car we bought him after his got repossessed, and is currently homeless.  I’ve had him blocked for months, finally putting a boundary up to protect from verbal and emotional abuse. So much detail missing, but I feel very guilty, I don’t want him to be living on the street, but I have no energy and feel we’ve done more than we needed to to help him and it goes wasted.

The delivery took a lot longer than usual and the food arrived a bit cold - my wife grabbed hers and went to microwave it.

I said it as I noticed it and had sincere intentions just trying to make sure she had noticed it.    She feels like I was belittling her and degrading, making her feel like I didn't think she was smart enough to use the microwave safely.

81,1e9dujs,WIBTA if I said no to being a bridesmaid?,"I (20F) got asked by my bf's older brothers fiancée to be her bridesmaid this past week. 

After work I went back to my bf's family home since I was staying over for a couple of days, right as I open the door I greet the gf who had just come back from a trip with her bf a day before. She gleefully stares at me and goes ""oh did you not hear the news"" and shows me her left hand to show her engagement ring. I congratulate her and ask about how the trip was etc etc. 

The conversation came to her asking me to be her bridesmaid after mentioning she had her maid of honour and one bridesmaid so far. I awkwardly responded by saying ""ohh haha I haven't dressed up in so long I don't know how I'll wear a dress"" she responded that I could wear whatever, even a suit if I wanted. I ended up telling her that I'll let her know about it and leaving that topic there. 

Thing is.. I don't really want to be one of her bridesmaids. From what I know, her and the fiance have been together for about 9 months meaning that I've known her for even less. Our conversations are always very base-level and I only talk to her because she's been living in the family home with her now fiance. I don't really have a relationship with the older brother either, so to me it seems strange that she'd ask me to be her bridesmaids when I feel that's something you'd ask a close friend. 

It's not like I explicitly said yes or no, but because of that I know the question will come up again.. Would I be rude to say I don't want to? How would I even turn it down in a polite way?

To fill in the context’s i factory resetted my computer and i let him know before i do it (even if its upon creating new google account’s, drawing, or anything because if i don’t he would be pissed if he didn’t know my very move) he’s a shit parent but he did everything for me like providing me clothes and stuff so i can’t say anything about it. He’s also paying for my college fees and essentials for me when i go there.

When i was around the age of 12, i would often have my privacy breached and his only excuse were ‘between a daughter and a father shouldn’t have privacy!’ And he would read my diary with my mom to have a laugh as well as reading my text message in instagram, he made my life a living hell and it felt like i’m running around with an eggshell with him.

I think around 2 or 3 months i have problems with my computer and i have no one to help, i can’t use my computer where i usually draw- just drawing. The problem is that it would make this ‘tick tick tick’ noises when booted up and the computer is running with the oldest nividia engine so everytime i draw it’ll be HELL. My friend reccomended that i should factory reset it so i did. I told my dad about it and he just said with a simple ‘okay’ and ignored me and i thought it was fine.

Yea no i was dead wrong. SOOO wrong, because he acknowledge my computer as the family computer, not MY computer he gave to me wholeheartedly.

83,1e9dkco,AITA for telling my friend she doesn’t value me as much as I value her?,"I (19F) am rooming with one of my friends (18F) in DC as we do our own internships. This was my first time rooming with someone who wasn’t a family member for a long period of time. 

The problem began before we even actually came to DC. We attend the same institution and I was planning on driving home and then driving to DC, whereas she was planning on flying. I had a bin with a couple of things I was planning on bringing and offered her to put some of her stuff in there. She ended up filling it up the rest of the way, buying a second bin and also filling it, and giving me one of her large suitcases. I initially accepted it, but it ended up causing arguments between my parents and I come move in day. 

Throughout the course of our time here, she has continued to amass things, which makes it hard for me considering the expect she wants me to take all her stuff back as well. Another issue has been money. She had her housing completely paid for, whereas I had to scrape together the money to pay for it. Yet, I have born the brunt of our expenditures, particularly in groceries and household supplies. I am not paid, so I don’t have a source of income and this has been particularly hard. 

Furthermore, we share an apartment with some other girls and my roommate has shared personal things I told her with them without my permission. She also has spoken for me when we’re out in big groups, which is something that frustrates me to no end. I also share everything that I learn (gossip) with her and invite her to places I go to. She doesn’t do the same, making plans with our other roommates and not inviting me. I usually end up getting invites from our other roommates, but at that point I no longer wish to go. 

My internship is also in person (about a 45 minute commute from where I’m staying) and hers is completely virtual. So I would always end up waking her up when getting ready. I would come home and complain at times, as one does after a long day of work, and she would dismiss my feelings, further upsetting me. 

This all came to a boiling point when I found the sink wet one too many times (she never wipes it down after using it). I told her we needed to talk and that she wasn’t valuing me to the same extent.

He chose to bring it up at the hospital right after my sister had just given birth.

86,1e9ciwb,AITA for refusing to let my cats go outdoors?,"Hi there! I'm posting here mainly because i feel a little silly about this whole thing. My GF (23F) recently moved in with me (24F). I have 3 three cats which she was not only aware of, but excited to live with. I'm aware I'm a little crazy in regards to my cats, but even before I owned any cats i was thoroughly against outdoor cats. I find it inhumane because they endanger the natural wildlife, as well as themselves. Furthermore, having a cat be outdoors without any supervision is illegal in my area. Also I love my cats and would be way too stressed if they were ever outside the house.

Initially there wasn't any issues when she moved in with me, my two skittish cats slowly warmed up to her and the three of them battled for space on our bed with us. That was, until my girlfriend suggested we let them be indoor/outdoor cats, which i quickly shut down for the reasons listed above. She didnt push so I figured the issue was resolved. That was until, suddenly, the doors of my house were being left a smidgen open pretty much every other day. This resulted in me having a minor panic attack everytime I noticed and running around doing a headcount for my cats. Initially I thought the cats had just learnt how to push the doors open, but even when all three of them were with me I'd go downstairs to find the doors open.

I confronted my girlfriend about it and she wouldn't admit to it, but I am beyond certain it's her. Even though she doesn't admit to it she tells me that even if they got out it wouldnt be a big deal, but it would to me! My cats have pretty much been my lifeline the whole time i've had them (my oldest is 5) and I don't even know how I'll move on when they pass before me, let alone if I lost them because a door was left open.

Initially I thought the cats had just learnt how to push the doors open, but even when all three of them were with me I'd go downstairs to find the doors open.

I confronted my girlfriend about it and she wouldn't admit to it, but I am beyond certain it's her. Even though she doesn't admit to it she tells me that even if they got out it wouldnt be a big deal, but it would to me! My cats have pretty much been my lifeline the whole time i've had them (my oldest is 5) and I don't even know how I'll move on when they pass before me, let alone if I lost them because a door was left open. Is there a better way I can communicate this? Am I dying on the wrong hill? AITA?

EDIT: There's been major developments since I posted this and I'm still in the middle of it all, but you guys were right, obviously, girlfriends gotta go.",0.0,1.0600992441177368,1,0
87,1e9canl,AITA for kicking my friend out after he drunk peed on my apartment floor?,"
I (m20) have this internet friend (m20) I’ve known for 5 years and we finally met for the first time. The plan was that he stays at my partner and I’s place for a week and a half and I’d take him around the whole state, show him the spots, show him where I grew up etc. He’s been here for 4 nights and we decided we wanted to drink tonight, I had bought alcohol prior to him coming and we were just taking shots while watching a movie. I went to bed around 1am. Then at like 3am my boyfriend and I woke up to him falling and stumbling in the bathroom. I came out, asked what happened and if he’s okay. He looked me dead in the face like “yea I’m good, I just fell”, I stepped on something wet as soon as I walked out of the bedroom and assumed it was puke- asked if he puked on the floor he said no. 

I then went to go check on the bathroom and saw that he had peed all over the toilet, the wall behind it, the towels above the toilet, ripped the toilet paper holder off the wall and stepped in/flipped over my cats litter box and also broke the lid too.
I went back in the bedroom to tell my boyfriend what had just happened, which is when he said he heard him peeing on the floor- he was insistent that that’s what happened by the way it sounded. I definitely agree with him because the smell out there is fucking horrendous, I couldn’t get it out. I’m gonna need to rent a carpet cleaning vacuum now. The toilet paper dispenser will also make us look like bad tenants now.

I’m really pissed, my friend has zero awareness of his actions. I asked him if he knows what just happened and he just said “no, what happened?”. When I went to go clean up the alcohol too I saw he kept drinking after I went to bed- his shot glass was full to the brim and the 750ml bottle of Svedka I took maybe 2 sips out of before I left was halfway gone. 

My boyfriend and I both agree that he needs to leave, but I feel horrible sending him home. He’s here for another 10 days and I don’t even know if he’s able to move his flight to today. I also feel like it’s my fault because I left the alcohol out. ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-22,"AITA for kicking my friend out after he drunk peed on my apartment floor?

88,1e9bnpo,AITA for telling my sister I don't know what she else expects anyone else to do about my nephew/her son?,"My sister lost her first husband 6 years ago. My nephew Cale (16m) was 10 at the time. Obviously Cale was sad when his dad died and he didn't bounce back easily by any means. But he was also open about his sadness and missing his dad. He was still close to my sister and their relationship didn't suffer. If anything he was possibly a touch more clingy than typical for him but I know it's not uncommon when a child loses a parent.

When he was 12 Cale realized my sister had started dating someone. She had not introduced the new man to Cale, she had not mentioned him, but he found it out. He actually brought it up before she told anyone. And from there he pulled away from my sister and from all of us. Ever since he has been distant, does not share his feelings with any of us and his relationship with my sister is incredibly strained. My sister was aware of this and saw it. But she decided to introduce her now husband to Cale and eventually Cale met her husband's children also without any intervention from a therapist or anything. Cale was distant with them too and I'm not sure he could tell you much about them today if asked. A lot of this was done over Zoom calls and also ""distanced hangouts"". My sister and her husband moved in together once restrictions were lifted and they got married two years ago.

Cale's distance has not changed. I have spoken to him, so have my mom and two brothers but he doesn't open up to us and he shrugs if asked why he doesn't give them a chance or if he's encouraged to try and see if he could like my sister's husband and stepchildren. I know he still has friends. I'm not sure if he's more open with his friends or not honestly. Or if he's more open with his paternal side of the family.

My sister had another son with her husband 9 months ago and I believe that was the event that brought on this desperation for someone to do something. She has asked our parents, brothers and me repeatedly to do something. She knows we have spoken to Cale before. It has become a loop now of her trying to make us do something after she fails to get Cale to speak to her. She said spending time just the two of them is so silent unless she talks non stop. We have all told her we understand that's upsetting and frustrating for her.

Friday night we had a siblings night and she brought the topic up to me and our brothers again. I told her I don't know what else she expects us to do when we have done all we can as extended family but maybe a therapist could help. She told me I know exactly what she expects us to do and why is it such a problem now. My brothers told her I was right but she said there are better ways to say you don't want to try anymore, which wasn't what I was saying but she took it that way.

89,1e9bkf5,AITA for asking my mother not to eat food in the car?,"
I (16F) asked my mother (42F) not to eat a specific food from a fast food restaurant because the smell made me sick.

We started off quite early at 6 AM in the morning, leaving a resort to go home.

Halfway throughout going home, my mother asked if we could stop because she said that she was hungry. My grandfather didn’t like the idea of stopping, so they came to a compromise. We pick the food up through drive-through and eat it as we go. We picked a fast food restaurant to eat at. I didn’t have a problem up until that point, but here’s the dilema: My mother wanted to eat a specific food from the menu that she knew made the smell made me sick.

I asked her if she could eat something else on the menu, that the smell would stink up in our car and would make me feel sick for the rest of the drive home. My grandfather took this as an opportunity and said we should just eat when we get home since there were limited options on the menu anyway. My grandmother and father agreed, saying they weren’t hungry anyways. So, my mother had no choice but to play along.

Around 20 minutes in and my mother started yelling and complaining for food. She also kept pointing out the fact that I had such a weak stomach and that the smell bothering me wasn’t her problem.

In the end, we ended up at the gas station. At there, she kept giving me side-eyes and refused to talk to me until we got home.

I wonder if I should’ve spoken up for my mother and should’ve simply have pointed out that she could just eat something else on the menu. (I did say this earlier, but I don’t think anybody cared.)

91,1e9azuq,"AITA for telling my friend to ""Stop forcing Jesus onto me"" because of her ridiculous level of Christianness?","Throwaway account and fake names

I (18F) am with this girl Jessica (18F) in the same friend group in high school. Jessica is a devout Christian and goes to a Presbyterian church every Sunday for mass. I have no problem with this and it was nice to see that she was able to live a happier life because of her Christianity.

Her religious expression was very normal and nuanced at first. She would do things like wearing a cross necklace, adding bible verses in her socials etc. The issue came with when she would show up to our lunch table with a bible and kept reminding us about how ""God is Great"" etc. The last straw came when she had made a separate instagram account dedicated to making posts about the bible and telling people on how to live a holy life. She had even tried to make her own Christian podcast at one point.

At one lunchtime, she told us she was ranting about how ""offensive"" it was for people to wear things like cross jewellery when they weren't even Christian and how egregious ""Jesus Christ Superstar"", one of my favourite musicals was. I told her that while her religious beliefs were fine, me and my friends were frankly getting sick and tired of her bringing Jesus, God and the bible into every single conversation, as well as on her social medias. I also further reminded her that recontextualizations of the bible were perfectly fine and that the musical was a medium to explore the humanity of Jesus, because frankly he is human like us.

Jessica got offended and looked at me coldly, before responding with ""Are you suggesting you're better than Jesus?"" I got sick and tired of her at this point and said to her sarcastically ""Look, Jesus loves you, but he wants you to shut the fuck up"".

I then got heated in the moment and told her that her level of devoutness was extremely ridiculous, before telling her that she didn't need to make her ""Christianness"" as her entire personality. I also bluntly told her it seemed like she was subtly suggesting she was better than the rest of us just because she practiced her Christianity a lot.

Jessica hasn't talked to me since then and I'm wondering if I did overstep a little bit. My friends agree with me, saying that Jessica's behaviour was extremely weird and that she was a hypocrite. Meanwhile, my inner self is feeling conflicted. I feel like the sarcasm/swearing was stooping down to her level. 

So Reddit, AITA here??

TL;DR: I got mad at my ""friend"" for always bringing her religion into all of our social interactions recently and now i'm wondering if i overstepped by clapping back.

92,1e9aw6x,AITA for overreacting to my best friend asking for space?,"
Basically I recently had a close family friend pass away from pancreatic cancer. My best friend (call him Jim) was my main support outlet and we were messaging and calling constantly. We had been best friends for about a year at this point fyi. 

Basically though our friendship originally started from having a crush on each other (two guys), he lost feelings once we became close friends but I never truly did. Multiple times I felt like I was over him but a mutual friend kept giving me hints and ideas and making me believe he would still date me for months. Honestly though I just appreciated the friendship and did so much for him, daily buying him drinks etc, buying him dinner, going to his sports games, buying him stuff in video games, all for nothing in return which I was fine with.

Then about 3 months ago he decided he wasnt gay anymore and had a huge falling out with the mutual friend over him confusing me and telling me shit. A few months later and Jim started telling me that he missed the friend and the drama he brought, despite him being a shit person really. I told him this and warned him not to go back to him but he did anyway about a week before what I’m about to explain. 

So one night he comes over to my house sleeps over etc, we stay up till 4am and nothing intimate happens bcs we were just enjoying each others company. I bought him food like normal, he went home and all was fine. Then that night he says he needs space but doesnt explain why or what I did, keep in mind he sucks at serious conversations as well, so I start worrying and breakdown because the person I was going to for support over the loss of someone close to me isn’t there for me and I’m struggling. 

Then the mutual friend, who I hate now, messages me and tells me to leave Jim alone and that he hates me etc. For no reason. Personally I feel like Jim was manipulated by the mutual friend because of previous things that have happened. Anyway then a week later I ask Jim if he is ready to talk and he says he doesnt want to be friends anymore because I overreacted and it made him uncomfortable that I care so much about him. 

I still have to see him everyday at school now and we are in a bunch of communities together (that I got him an executive role in) and play basketball together so he can’t avoid me very well. I just feel like hes being stupid and is being manipulated but the friends, sure I overreacted and maybe me having a crush on him made him uncomfortable but had he told me that before I would have stopped. Our friendship was worth more than that. After everything I did for him and how close we were, constantly talking basically, I feel like hes being an asshole and not thinking clearly.

I never would have kept liking him had he told me it made him uncomfortable but I know he never did despite him apparently telling me. Honestly his reaction doesnt even make sense, he knew I was struggling and to do this?

So yeah AITA?

93,1e9at6g,AITA for fighting with my mom over chores? ,"Recently, I (18, nb) graduated high school and I am moving to a nearby major city for college in a month. I currently live with my mom (48), brother (20), and uncle (47).

My mom is incredibly hard working. After divorcing my dad she has gone to college, gotten her degree, and become a special education teacher. She’s now getting her masters degree. She’s basically worked her entire life and she is the main source of income for our family. 

Since my brother graduated two years ago he has not found a job and stays in his room and plays in video game tournaments. He is diagnosed autistic but has been high functioning and hasn’t needed many accommodations for a long time. I tried hard to have empathy for his situation and depression but i’ve reached a breaking point, he has helped clean maybe 8 times in those two years, leaves moldy gross dishes in the sink for me to clean, and he keeps us up at night screaming at his computer. I have always felt like my mom coddles him and she never pushes for him to help around the house past mentioning that the trash needs to go to the curb every week. 

My uncle is a textbook douche and pretty much stays in his room all the time. Honestly, I think he’s just leeching off of my mom because no one else talks to him. He doesn’t help out and only started paying rent recently after living with us for years. Luckily, he sometimes goes on work trips so he’s not around every couple months. 

Because my mom works so much, it’s not often that she’s home during the week so she doesn’t have a lot of time to help around the house. I also try to have empathy for her because she works very hard to give us a good life and support us, and now she’s helping me with my student loans and paying for dorm stuff. I will always be beyond grateful for what she sacrifices to raise me. 

I don’t have a huge issue with doing chores around the house and taking care of my family, especially since i’m home for the summer and haven’t been able to get someone to hire a minor for the summer. (However, this is also what I did during the school year and when I had a job). What I take issue with is when my mom comes home from work and asks me when i’m going to start helping around the house or that she doesn’t get any help. She never has these conversations with my brother, at least that i’ve seen or heard. It’s very frustrating but I don’t want to come across as disrespectful and I have trouble finding the right words so it usually turns into her saying something about why i’m always just staring at her and asking why I can’t just talk like a normal person and we end up fighting.

We are still very close despite all of this and I would never consider cutting her out of my life in any way, but i’m beginning to worry about and even dread coming home from college to a gross house and have to clean a house I no longer really live in and make messes in.

Am I being an asshole? Sometimes I feel justified in my frustration but other times I feel immature or ungrateful.

I also try to have empathy for her because she works very hard to give us a good life and support us, and now she’s helping me with my student loans and paying for dorm stuff. I will always be beyond grateful for what she sacrifices to raise me. 

I don’t have a huge issue with doing chores around the house and taking care of my family, especially since i’m home for the summer and haven’t been able to get someone to hire a minor for the summer. (However, this is also what I did during the school year and when I had a job). What I take issue with is when my mom comes home from work and asks me when i’m going to start helping around the house or that she doesn’t get any help. She never has these conversations with my brother, at least that i’ve seen or heard. It’s very frustrating but I don’t want to come across as disrespectful and I have trouble finding the right words so it usually turns into her saying something about why i’m always just staring at her and asking why I can’t just talk like a normal person and we end up fighting.

We are still very close despite all of this and I would never consider cutting her out of my life in any way, but i’m beginning to worry about and even dread coming home from college to a gross house and have to clean a house I no longer really live in and make messes in.

Am I being an asshole? Sometimes I feel justified in my frustration but other times I feel immature or ungrateful.

94,1e9aqns,AITA for having a pic of my boyfriend’s butt on my phone? ,"I 18f have a boyfriend 19m. Ages ago noticed he had like slight stretch marks on his ass which he’s NOT FAT like at all so I think it’s actually from his working out like squats and shit lol. 

Anyway tho I have pictures of it because I took some with his permission because we were just having fun idk. We take and have intimate pictures of each other but they’re always saved in our Snapchat private my eyes only folder so you need to enter a separate password to see them.  

But this pic I just had on my main camera roll because I didn’t consider it a private one. You know this isn’t him posing with his dick in hand or anything. It’s not a close up of his ass either it’s just him naked but like full shot of his back head to feet. It’s actually like a flattering pic which isn’t a defence more I’m just giving full context for what the pic was which I feel is important. 

The other day we’re just going through my camera roll and I scroll past it and he mentions like why the hell do I have that there and I explain my reasoning and I be honest with him and say I’ve been casually going through my camera roll with friends before and they’ve seen it. Tho I thought it was harmless, they even complimented him 😂 

But he was actually like pretty mad (for him anyway he never gets mad and realistically this wasn’t even made more just annoyed/irritated) saying I should’ve known not to have it there. But well I just didn’t so ignorance isn’t really my fault whenever it’s not that serious of a situation. ",Asshole,2024-07-22,"AITA for having a pic of my boyfriend’s butt on my phone?

95,1e9ae7r,AITA for unfriending my best friend over a singer I love?,"I (17F) have been friends with Rain (18F) for 10 months. My best friend Kylee (18F) introduced us, and we bonded over a shared love for a specific singer, even attending their concert together. However, there were red flags in our friendship early on. Rain took a mostly free trip to Japan with Kylee but never paid back the money. She missed Kylee's graduation, forgot my birthday, and often made false statements.

Kylee wanted to cut ties with Rain, planning to do so before college. I still had hope. Recently, false allegations against our favorite singer resurfaced. Rain quickly believed the allegations without evidence, despite previously claiming to love the singer as much as I did. I tried to show her evidence proving the allegations were false, but she wouldn't listen. Frustrated, I apologized, but Rain made a viral TikTok supporting the allegations. 

I asked her to take it down, and she sarcastically ""forgave"" me. I called out her ingenuine apology, and she eventually apologized for the tone. She agreed to take down the video but ignored me all day. When I sent a message saying she cared more about a viral video than our friendship, she deleted the video and showed me. 

However, later she blocked both me and Kylee on all social media, reposted, and pinned the video. Angry, I sent her a message saying she valued a TikTok more than her friends and blocked her. Kylee and I had helped her a lot, including providing a place to stay and paying for therapy she never used.

We have a travel trailer out back on the family farm. We all also have full time jobs. I’m on house arrest and I have to charge my ankle monitor for at least 3 hours a day, some times less. I just got approved to go back to work while still wearing said monitor. I can still go places on the property and help but I can’t leave without permission. So, today I woke up at about 10am (I work night shift at a very busy restaurant) and I had to be to work at 3pm I was charging my monitor and drinking coffee with my fiancée and the step mom came knocking and said “can you guys help move water? It’s only a few lines (8 to be exact)
My fiancée  said “sure I can help! She’s charging but it won’t take long” and she went to help, then fed some cows
After about another hour I am folding clothes, still charging and the step mom bursts in the trailer screaming that I don’t help and my fiancée only helps and I’m basically worthless. 
Back story: 
I’ve been on house arrest for 2 months, in that two months I have made dinner every night for 5 to 8 people. sometimes the dad and step mom take the dinner I made elsewhere to eat with other family and I have to make another meal for us. I do all the house chores (laundry, dishes, vacuum etc.) on top of farm chores (feeding animals, yard work and moving handlines- about 75 ish of them) AND get permission from my probation officer to go shopping for groceries! 
Today was my second day back to work after 2 months of a free maid service for this woman! Shes ranting about me not being helpful and how I am lazy and sit all day and my fiancée does all the work, and makes it easy on me because I’m spoiled. 
She then proceeds to tell BOTH of us that we are no longer allowed in her house for any reason and that we are not welcome at all! She stormed out and slammed the trailer door so hard it won’t close properly now….

97,1e99i93,AITA for telling my girl her friend's wedding is a waste of my time? ,"My girl is friends with a group of 4 girls. 3 of the 4 girls have boyfriends or husbands. The 4th girl is single and never married. 

One girl is getting married and she asked my girl and the married girl to be her brides maids. Her sister is the maid of honor. 

The groom asked his friends to be the groomsmen. No idea who his best man is. Don't care. We're not that close. I didn't even know about the wedding until a few weeks ago.

They are having it about 2 hours away. They're making a big deal about it and trying to get everyone to go make a weekend out of it. I have no interest in spending a weekend with them. I don't even like hanging out with them when the girls get together and try to make all the men hang out. 

I told my girl I have no interest in wasting my weekend. I rather be at home alone. She initially pushed but compromised and said I can drive up the day of and don't have to be there all weekend. I told her I don't even want to go at all since I don't really know them and care enough to spend a day there. 

I have no problem with her being a BM and pairing up with one of his friends. But my feeling is that what's the point of me wasting my time sitting there in the crowd by myself while my girl is busy with the wedding party and everything all day? 

Seriously, I don't think there is any obligation for the men in a group of female friends to be suddenly best friends and hang out. I have my own friends. I'm happy her friend found someone and he's a nice guy but we're not tight or anything.

98,1e99c8e,AITA for not giving me sister money to feed her baby?,"My (26F) sister (23F) was actively trying for a baby when she didn’t have stable income. Previous to this, she worked minimum wage in retail but quit to do makeup/ be a makeup artist. She does get clients, but it is not stable or enough to be supporting a baby.

When she told me she was trying to get pregnant, I advised her against it cause she was still young and most importantly her income would not be able to support a baby. She kinda dismissed me and said her boyfriend has a well paying job making roughly 50k a year and that he would be able to support them. She then got pregnant a few months later and moved in with her boyfriend who rents an apartment.

Last month, she visited me and was asking for money to buy food and essentials because her boyfriend does not have much money left over after he pays the bills and that babies were more expensive than she thought. I gave her 1k (not a loan cause she would not be able to pay it back and I was ok to lose it) but now she’s back and asking for another 1k. 

I told her no and that I was okay to help her out last month, but I could not anymore because she chose to have a baby she was not ready for. She called me a bitch, greedy and a snob for not giving her money and said now my niece is going to go cold and hungry as they can’t afford to buy formula and new baby clothes (shes outgrowing the others).

I feel really bad but I also feel like I should be standing my ground and I don’t think her actions should impact me. I was okay with giving her 1k to help her out, but 2k is so much money. I also don’t want to keep giving her money because when does it end? She is still on “maternity leave” and wants to go back to makeup when they have enough money to put the child in daycare but they don’t have enough money now?

I’ve been with this girl on and off again for 13yrs at this point it’s some 4 months consistently. My GF went out after work on a girls lime at around 3pm and eventually came and me at my local bar around 8pm. We both agreed we would hang out for a bit and then go to my place. Around 11pm I got a phone call from my sister who indicated that my mother fell sick earlier in the evening around 7 and that she Had taken her to the hospital and they had just returned to my mothers house. 

I told my GF I would cancel and go see my mother as she resides alone. My father is deceased. And I stay there sometimes, my sister is married with kids. So we both headed to our cars. I asked her what she was doing, and she replied “I’m goin home” 

so I get home and msg my girlfriend and she starts off “ hey….dont be mad ….im  at a next bar” 

now i on previous occasions have had issue with this, where we both go together both decided to go to our respective places because work …. And she ends up at some bar with friends until 2-3am. Maybe 3 or 4 prior occasions.

  
So when she indicated this I just send three red angry face imojis and said I cant do this right now and blocked her on WhatsApp. Our main source of communication outside of in person conversatio.

the next morning she calls me and I unblock her and we have a brief conversation about me being controlling and that if she wants to something even if she changes her mind… I can’t tell her what to do. I told her I would have expected some emotional support or at the very least if it occurred to her that I might get angry then why go ahead and do it? 

she then proceeds to block me. For the rest of the day. We had previously planned to go to an event at 7 so about 630 I msged her… and realised the msgs went through… so I asked if she unblocked me why didnt she msg, and she said that she thought I would see from the profile pic. and she can’t talk because she is driving to the event… we had planned to in one vehicle. So I chose not go as to avoid any public scene..

the next day we meet to discuss this And she insists that she can do as she pleases.   
that my being angry over her going to the bar, is being controlling, and that my feelings of being left with no moral support in a difficult time is unwarranted.   
that she could have just as much responded to me from the bar as her home and it in no way affected me. (Previous incidents have shown that when she is at a bar with friends I get a response after maybe 5mins or up to an hour.    
That even if she said to me in person she was going home she can change her mind about anything at anytime.

",Asshole,2024-07-22,"AITA for telling my girlfriend she should have done what she said she was going to… M(43) GF(36) .. I’ve been with this girl on and off again for 13yrs at this point it’s some 4 months consistently. My GF went out after work on a girls lime at around 3pm and eventually came and me at my local bar around 8pm. We both agreed we would hang out for a bit and then go to my place. Around 11pm I got a phone call from my sister who indicated that my mother fell sick earlier in the evening around 7 and that she Had taken her to the hospital and they had just returned to my mothers house. 

I told my GF I would cancel and go see my mother as she resides alone. My father is deceased. And I stay there sometimes, my sister is married with kids. So we both headed to our cars. I asked her what she was doing, and she replied “I’m goin home” 

so I get home and msg my girlfriend and she starts off “ hey….dont be mad ….im  at a next bar” 

now i on previous occasions have had issue with this, where we both go together both decided to go to our respective places because work …. And she ends up at some bar with friends until 2-3am. Maybe 3 or 4 prior occasions.

  
So when she indicated this I just send three red angry face imojis and said I cant do this right now and blocked her on WhatsApp. Our main source of communication outside of in person conversatio.

the next morning she calls me and I unblock her and we have a brief conversation about me being controlling and that if she wants to something even if she changes her mind… I can’t tell her what to do. I told her I would have expected some emotional support or at the very least if it occurred to her that I might get angry then why go ahead and do it? 

she then proceeds to block me. For the rest of the day. We had previously planned to go to an event at 7 so about 630 I msged her… and realised the msgs went through… so I asked if she unblocked me why didnt she msg, and she said that she thought I would see from the profile pic. and she can’t talk because she is driving to the event… we had planned to in one vehicle.

102,1e97y2o,AITA for not wanting to be liable for my grandma during a ~10 hr flight?,"Situation:
Plan for kid-free wedding anniversary and my bday (31M) to Hawaii with my wife (29F). Plan is to relax and spend time together, which is needed as we have a 3yo toddler. Plan is to kick it back, drink some alcohol, and let loose. Plan is to have a true vacation and not have a care in the world. 

The controversy:
1) The hotel was paid for by my parents as an early birthday gift (they have a timeshare).
2) My parents are the sole “care-taker” of my grandma. Care-taker as in they help her as needed and for transportation. Does this make me secondary “care-taker?”
3) It’s a 10 hour flight excluding layover. 

My stance:
1) Though my grandma is 88yo, she is very functional. She’s 88yo and looks like she’s in her late 60’s. My wife’s 72yo grandmother is in worse shape than my 88yo grandmother. My grandmother walks with a cane, and that’s about her only physical limitation that is easily observable. No dementia. She has total control of her bladder and bowels. Pretty good shape for an 88yo! I do think she still should travel with someone. This is more of a “why me?” situation.
2) My expectation of this trip is it starts as soon as  my wife and I drop little dude off with my wife’s parents for the week (they are excited to have him for a week! They already watch him 2/week already and FaceTimes little guy on days they don’t watch him)
3) My uncle and his family are also going to Hawaii to a different hotel. My grandmother is going to spend the vacation with them, and not with my wife and I. So since grandma is going to vacation with them, how come they aren’t the ones flying with her?
4) My grandmother goes on 18hr flights twice a year to visit us in the US (she resides in the Philippines). 10 hour flights is nothing compared to her twice a year 18hour flights.

My anticipated and assumed opposing stance:
1) My grandma is 88yo, needs a cane to walk, has medications that she needs help with, and  I’m a nurse. My uncle and aunt are not nurses; he’s a software engineer and she’s a SAHM.
2) I’m Filipino. This is an implied caring for family over caring for yourself culture. There’s no such thing as “solo time” or “hubby/wifey time.” My parents are the main helpers for my grandmother, as maybe I should be the one taking over.
3) My uncle and his family live 5 hours away from the airport when we live 20 min away from the airport. It would be easier for my grandmother to fly with my wife and I.
4) My uncle and his family = 44M, 39F, 18F (autistic), 7F, 3F. I’m 31, and my wife is 29. 

I’m conflicted as I feel saying no to my parents regarding flying with my grandmother would make me TA. On the other hand, my wife and in-laws (my wife verbalized her concern to her parents) feel we shouldn’t be the ones liable for my grandmother; It’s supposed to be a vacation with no stress and this is a big stressor, and that my grandmother is going on vacation with my uncle and his family and not with my wife and I.

104,1e97nz5,AITA for telling my mom she is too controlling?,"My mom, is very controlling, and she'll tell you that she is. She says stuff like she knows she's a helicopter parent, and that I'm just going to have to get over it all the time, and in the past, I've just been ignoring it. 

So, for some back story, My mom (40f) and me (19m) don't get along very well, we really never have. So, I went on vacation with my friend about a month ago, and she decided to go through my room, and finds my notebook, where I very colorfully described how I felt about a lot of the arguments we've had in the past, It also had writings about other stuff like work and my partner and friends, but she basically read everything. 

So, I'm at dinner with my buddy and his parents, and she calls me SCREAMING about what I wrote. I told her that it was my notebook, and I could write what I want in it, and that I'm sure she'd rather me write about it than just yell everything at her during an argument. She got even more mad and claimed that I ""never tell her how I feel"" and that i make her ""sound like a bad mom"". So, for the first time, I lost it on her, I went outside, away from my friend and his family and yelled at her that it wasn't my fault that she found my notebook because she went through my room and read through it. And that maybe she should stop being so nosey and leave my stuff alone. 

The conversation grew and she told me that I had to come home right then, and that I was to throw the book away and that she was going to start going through my room to make sure I didn't do anything like that again.

I (17F) today as well as my sisters (25F and 22F) and took a family friend (7M) to a games centre to have fun. He’s been going through a lot in the past few months as he lost his mother and has a baby sister with numerous health complications. 

Today I made the mistake of wearing crocs to our outing instead of running shoes and I was not allowed in as I needed close toed shoes. My sisters were rightfully upset and I bought new shoes that were kinda ugly but did the trick. The cashier said I could return them if they were not worn outside at all. Since the games centre was inside I thought I could maybe return with the receipt because they technically weren’t outside.

However my sisters were angry with me at the thought and said I was going to be dishonest and a liar if I returned them and wore them outside. I told them I would go check and ask them first before trying to return them. They told me I had to give the receipt to them and I refused at first and they started yelling at me. I gave it to them as I did not want to make us more late and upset the child.

She was heavily embarassed but I was insisting that I was not going to leave until she buckled. It was not safe and I didn't feel comfortable.

I ended up trying a bit more and was able to click in the seatbelt. I felt really bad about making her go through that embarrassment, but I wanted to make sure that we were both safe. 

The drive back to her place was quiet and a little uncomfortable. I tried to assure her that it was okay and that she didn't have to be embarrassed, trying to make her feel better but she was brushing it off. 

We ended the night awkward and I felt really bad.

107,1e97cn3,AITA: best friend’s new boyfriend wanted to spend the night while I was staying with her.,"So my best friend started dating a new guy (D) about a month and a half ago. They’ve been coworkers for about 6 months, and spend lots of time together outside of work. 

This weekend I drove 3.1/2 hours to stay with her to celebrate her birthday. I came in late Friday night. On Saturday, a group of us rented boat, went to dinner then hung out at her apartment afterwards. D was with us the entire time. 

Later that night, everyone had already left, it was just me, him and her hanging at her place. D randomly asked, “So what are our plans for tomorrow?” 

My best friend failed to tell me that not only was he spending the night, but that he was going to be with us for the entire next day. Even though we had just spent all day together. 

I only get to see my friend maybe 4-5x a year. I understand her wanting me to meet and get along with her new boyfriend. But at the same time, I was really looking forward to spending quality time with her and I wasn’t able to do that with him constantly being around. 

I just can’t imagine a world where I invite my best friend to drive 3.1/2 hours to stay with me, then have my new boyfriend of 6 weeks also stay the night while she’s staying with me. Even though he has his own place. I would cherish that time, especially since I don’t get to see her often. I can spend time with my boyfriend literally any day of the week. But I don’t get to see my best friend often.

Again nothing is wrong with him he’s a sweet amazing attractive guy. But especially after being rejected to do things with me. I just don’t feel any romantic attraction. But I he insisted so I said okay.

 I felt maybe just one more chance, he’s a good guy. But now I’m kinda feeling like I’m wasting his time. I’m just not experienced in dating AT ALL.

For unknown reasons, when my partner and I first got together, he made up some horrible lies about me and told his friends. This was hurtful, it took us months, maybe even a year to work it through it, we did, we’re over it however its still touchy when thought about. 
For 3 years, C was awful to me and I ignored it. C is also the type of person to want attention at gatherings, cries every time over anything, and is not a girls girl and wants the boys of the groups attention. One night, I discovered the lies my partner had told his friends incl her, I cried, she cried and we realized that this whole issue of her towards me was my partner's fault. We had a real power to the girls moment, fk this guy, concluded to be friends. Everything was laid out to everyone, my partner admitted lying, everything concluded. I was hurt but worked on it and got over it. 

Since then, every time I have seen her she ignores me. A few times I have tried directly talking with her and she will whisper to her partner and not respond to me. Its come up a couple times from her the ‘situation’ and its concluded with me saying I don’t care about the past, everything is good lets move on. I never said anything about her ignoring me and just down right being rude. We have invited them to camping trips, and even our engagement party (I was reluctant but it is my fiance’s best friend’s girlfriend). They did not show up. They’ve been invited to group outings of everyone to hang out and they rarely come, or he just does. 
5 years on, they had a party at there house. I asked several times if I was welcome – partners best friend said yes. We went, having a great ol time. C decides to start bringing up the past to my fiancé. She said how she feels isolated because of the situation, because of how she feels about me because of the situation. My fiancé kept saying he was a c**t. He didn’t want to talk about it but also couldn’t tell her not to as she would get upset if he did. 

I lost it. I aggressively yelled ‘what the fk is your problem, tell me what your problem is so I can fix it’. She said she felt isolated, I said the only problem I have with her is her obsession with my relationship issue that happened 5 year ago, she kept repeating herself, I told her to get over it, she kept going etc. I then stopped it and said its not going anywhere, lets set a later time to talk about this and I left the party with my fiancé and some of our friends (we travelled together).

113,1e96ls9,WIBTA - Leaving my job,"I (40M)have been working for a startup for over four years.  I've held various positions at the company and worked with almost every department.  I started when there are less than 20 people and now we have almost 500. The department head that runs my department was let go a year ago, and I've been filling in ever since.  I haven't had any change in compensation even with the change in my role and the increase in responsibilities.  It's been over 2 years since I got a pay increase. 100% of what I do is remote.

With the change in my position, I've done a lot to change my department, and I have the authority to do so.  There were a lot of things that I didn't like about how things were done before, so I increased the transparency of what my department does with other departments as well as my boss, the CEO.

Things started off well, but then I started to burn out.  I got sick almost non-stop for a month and got stress induced shingles.  My boss kept in contact to check in on how I was doing and I never missed a full day of work. The company was going through a rough patch, and data from my department is crucial to other departments. I don't have anyone that I can delegate certain tasks to because we are small and budgets don't allow for it.

More and more has been asked of my small department to the point that nothing is ever enough. I'm getting more and more stressed out and have been pushing back to limit request, but it never stops. Additional asks come from the CEO multiple times per week.  He's cancelled 1 on 1s with all of his departments heads like myself.

A few weeks back, he slacked me that he wasn't happy and needed more.  My response was that he should start looking for someone else that would be better suited for the position.  We had a video call later that day to discuss the situation.  He didn't say much. I didn't give a written notice at that time (still haven't).

The next time we met was almost a month later.  I was upset, and I reached out his is assistant to get a 1-1 with him.  He was busy and tried to cancel, and I almost quit on the spot. We did speak and he mentioned that he had been in touch with recruiters and interviewing to fill my role. He also mentioned that he knew that things have been rough for me.  I rebutted that statement directly and professionally (that convo could a post in itself). That conversation was almost 2 weeks ago and we haven't had another one since.

114,1e96hsl,AITA for not inviting my parents to my in-laws cousin’s barbecue?,"So recently the small town I grew up in celebrated a significant anniversary. As part of the celebration, relatives of my wife’s family who were descendants of the original founders decided to join the parade in horse-drawn carriages, and follow the ride up with a family barbecue. We have roughly 40 people on three carriages, and least 60 at the barbecue. My parents did show up to the watch the parade, as was perfectly their right to do, being a public event and all. 

However the trouble started an hour later when my parents rolled up to the house where the family was having the barbecue, unannounced, unrelated, and uninvited. I was busy trying to wrangle my three kids so I couldn’t exactly stop to ask them how they found us. They couldn’t exactly have followed our carriages since we were in the middle of the parade, and several roads adjacent to the route were blocked off. 

Now I’m sure my mother would have appreciated an invite as she loves to make things that aren’t about her be about her. But I think my wife and I have a right to do our own thing, and there were plenty of other things around town to do, and with more people they would actually have known better. And besides, it wasn’t my party, and I had no idea where we would be beforehand. It’s not really like I could have invited them even if I wanted.

We found out the next day that we were in a little bit of trouble. The host piped up to a slightly closer relative to my wife that they didn’t appreciate my parents crashing the party. Which I completely understand and empathize with. So now we’re trying to figure out “how did they find us? How did they know where we were?” Not that we were hiding, but we were definitely a little off the beaten path. 

It turns out one of my wife’s uncles who had decided to watch the parade rather than join it had run into my parents on the route shortly after our carriages had passed them. He told them where were. He says he didn’t invite them, but apparently my mom took him divulging our location AS an invite. So now we have to apologize to the host for these two random strangers showing up to their home.

115,1e96dxv,AITAH for telling my friend to break up with her bf?,"I (20F) have a good friend of 8 years. Let’s call her Anne. She (19f) has been dating her boyfriend (27m) for about a year. 

When they first got together Anne was super happy and spoke nothing but praises for him saying how was a good communicator to being supportive with her being in the military. But lately she’s been asking me for advice about marriage (I have been married for just about 2 years to my hubs (24m))

I’ve told her my opinion, and have said u don’t know this guy very well, but this is what it sounds like…. And fill in the blank. Lately he’s been spending more time with his grandpa who has a very old fashioned way of thinking and Anne’s bf has been changing his thinking to be similar to his grandpas. Example before Anne’s bf didn’t really feel like he wanted to be married and have kids, now he suddenly seems to want them. 

Anne called me asking what to do, and I asked her what she wanted, she said she wasn’t opposed to those things but she wasn’t ready yet, and that something just seems off when she thinks of being married to him. So I told her, if you don’t feel comfortable you might wanna break up. 

She was taken back by me saying that cause I’m not one to say “give up” but if it’s not going to work it’s not going to work. She told me, that I was bold to say such a thing and that I just don’t know him or his family well enough and that things might change. I’ve messaged her since and she hasn’t responded. So was I in the wrong?

EDIT: 
Thanks for your feedback so far!
After reading some of the comments, I think I might need to clear some things up
1. Anne and her bf went into this relationship BOTH NOT wanting to get married or have kids.
2. Anne’s told me she gets a bad/weird feeling thinking about marrying into this family.
3. Since bf family knows she’s in the military, grandpa has talked bad about women in the military and bf is adapting to like 1950s way of thinking.
I hope this can help clear somethings up!

UPDATE:
I didn’t even think I’d have to update this, but there’s more. I haven’t heard from Anne in over a week and I finally got a message from her say she was sorry how she reacted to what I said and that she should’ve listened to what I was saying. I guess after we talked she asked her bf if they could talk about their relationship he went ballistic and started yelling at her that she just need to shut up and do what she’s told and that she wasn’t a good woman cause she was in the military and that if she didn’t resign (like you can do that😂) he would dump her to the streets. This she clearly was upset about, and left without saying another word to him. He’s been appearing at her apartment trying to get to her. She’s since left and is in a hotel. She called me from her room asking if she can come stay with me till August cause she has to leave for deployment then anyway.

116,1e96c06,AITA for dropping a friend group? ,"This happened to me a couple of years ago… but I think it’s finally time I tell this story. It’s a long one so grab a snack. 

The summer before senior year of high school, I went on a month-long vacation with my family. For context, I was (and still am) an extremely busy person who does not have the availability to spend time with them, so I cherished every moment of this trip. In this short period of time, I did not look at my phone and ignored texts from my friends because I wanted to live in the moment. I learned so much from this trip and felt like I truly changed as a person.

When I arrived home, I immediately noticed that my friend group rarely talked in our group chat. Though I tried to start conversations, I would receive dry responses. I was super confused, but decided I shouldn’t worry about it because I had other friends to keep me company. 

Fast forward, 2 months later, senior year begins. Once or twice, I was invited to do something immature like going to a trampoline park or ding dong ditch. 5 years ago, spontaneous shenanigans like that would have intrigued me, but now I had no interest. So, I stopped sitting with them at lunch and started to hang out with another friend group instead. 

When I passed them on campus, they barely waved when I said hi. I was usually in a rush to get to somewhere because I was an overachieving student (still am lol) who always had study sessions or a club meeting. But it was evident that even when I went out of my way to ask how they were doing, they rarely looked up at me. 

On one of the last days of school, a friend from the group sent me an audio recording. From what I could gather, it was a 3 minute recording of me quickly talking to some of them and speed walking away because I had to go to a meeting. A couple of seconds later, my “friends” started to mock my voice, make fun of the way I walked away, and talk bad about my other close friends. When I listened to the recording for the first time, I remember shutting off my phone and having a nervous breakdown. Even though graduation was a few days away, I felt so betrayed and ashamed of myself. When I finally held my composure, I left all of our group chats, unfollowed everyone on social media, and deleted every picture of them off of my phone. I was so heartbroken that my friends (since middle school) would talk so harshly about me. 

I thought that after this disaster, it would be the last time I’d see any of them. 

Fast forward to last week at a party. All of the sudden, I hear a familiar voice. It was one of the friends in the group who said a lot of harsh things about me in the recording. She reaches in for a hug and I immediately push her away and tell her off. Since then, I wonder if I was too harsh. 

AITA? ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-22,"AITA for dropping a friend group?  This happened to me a couple of years ago… but I think it’s finally time I tell this story. It’s a long one so grab a snack. 

The summer before senior year of high school, I went on a month-long vacation with my family. For context, I was (and still am) an extremely busy person who does not have the availability to spend time with them, so I cherished every moment of this trip. In this short period of time, I did not look at my phone and ignored texts from my friends because I wanted to live in the moment. I learned so much from this trip and felt like I truly changed as a person.

When I arrived home, I immediately noticed that my friend group rarely talked in our group chat. Though I tried to start conversations, I would receive dry responses. I was super confused, but decided I shouldn’t worry about it because I had other friends to keep me company. 

Fast forward, 2 months later, senior year begins. Once or twice, I was invited to do something immature like going to a trampoline park or ding dong ditch. 5 years ago, spontaneous shenanigans like that would have intrigued me, but now I had no interest. So, I stopped sitting with them at lunch and started to hang out with another friend group instead. 

When I passed them on campus, they barely waved when I said hi. I was usually in a rush to get to somewhere because I was an overachieving student (still am lol) who always had study sessions or a club meeting. But it was evident that even when I went out of my way to ask how they were doing, they rarely looked up at me.

I (18F) am chronically ill; I have Lupus, PCOS, a heart condition and an undiagnosed seizure disorder. 
I had a graduation party and, as I am not a party person, only really two people came plus my gf (18F). 
My GMA (64F) then got upset at me for my gf having to stay over later than expected due to someone she was staying with being in the hospital and being unable to be picked up immediately the morning after. 
A few weeks back, my gma booked a campsite. She did nothing to precident this, not asking anyone’s schedule or preferences, only texting the family group chat to say “I booked a campsite. Plan on being there.”
My family was upset at this and scolded her for booking something without checking with anyone as most of them had plans or had to work. She came to me after a large fight with them in order to make herself feel better, inviting my gf along. She then uninvited my girlfriend from the camping trip a day before. It had suddenly become “family only” because she didn’t want to have to “be on somebody else’s schedule.”
I respectfully said I would stay home if that was the case, as I had only been looking forward to going on this trip with my gf.
She said, and I quote, “Okay, but just because you’re staying home in protest doesn’t mean you’ll get to see her. There will be no company in my house.”
The day after she left for the campsite I got very ill. Throwing up, both ends, the works. I had never had incontinence issues before this point and this was one of the toughest points I had ever had in my life. I ended up going to the ER with the help of my lovely gf who was there to take care of me. She showed no concern or empathy, downright denying I even went to the hospital. She did not leave her vacation or even feign being concerned if I was alright. I ended up having to lie about my gf coming over because she wouldn’t listen to the fact that I was sick at all so she definitely wouldn’t have accepted that I magically was too sick to have my gf over after she’d said no. 
During her vacation, I was unable to clear my room for the maid to clean due to being sick. I respectfully told her maid that no, I’d clean my own room eventually, I didn’t want her to have to clean around my things.
My gma took this point and ran with it. Telling me it’s not my house, it’s hers, and that’s her room and I don’t get to tell the maid not to clean my room because it’s a disaster. 
I decided to pack and leave that night, as she was not only acting like my abusive mother, but genuinely hurting me. She continued to text me all through the next day, still showing no concern over my health, texting me pictures of what she considered dirt in my room and telling me that she expected me to come “clean my filth.” AITAH for leaving?",Not enough info,2024-07-22,"AITAH for not cleaning my room?

119,1e96aud,AITA for causing troubles for my friend,"TLDR: I probably messed up my friend's relationship and made his illness worse.

Yesterday night I and my online friends were chatting in a group using an app.

One of my friends said that he use his partner's photo as the lock screen wallpaper on his phone. Then, I sent a message like ""Let me see this"" casually, although I know that his partner don't like to let others see his photo (actually, any private information, but I did not know at that time). My friend wanted to send me the photos privately, but he accidentally sent it in that group. I asked if it is allowable. However, when he realized that, it was too late to retreat the message.

After that, he wanted to flood the screen so that others won't see that photo, and I wanted to help him. Sadly, my phone locked because of my settings (I want to go to bed early) when I am sending some messages. I wanted to use other devices, but I haven't installed that app on other devices. If I install the app right now, I have to use my phone to log in (I think that app is also an asshole, and that is why I didn't install it on other devices). Another bad news is that my parents were not at home last night so I cannot use their phones as well ....

Finally two other friends helped him to flood the screen. It seems that no other person in that group saw the photo. He apologized to his partner over and over again. His partner just said one sentence like ""good job man"" and did not reply anything more (they are in different countries now). I did not help him any. I sent a message like ""It was my fault. Don't blame him"" to his partner, but I do not get any response up to now.

My friend has some serious mental and body illnesses, and he helped me a lot in many ways (although sometimes I helped him as well). This event triggered nervousness and some other problems for him. One week ago, he reserved doctors in two different hospitals today because he need to get some drugs. However, because of this issue, he got into troubles and cannot arrive the hospitals in time. He probably will miss the second hospital. These drugs are important to his illnesses, and in his city it is not easy to get them (he can only buy them in that two hospitals if he want a large amount of them).

I really messed up his life. I know that his life is bad (illnesses, bad family, ...), and he told me multiple times that he is extremely unlucky on everything. I cannot image that he still do not give up his life.

Just now I recalled that I have an old phone. I could have recharged it and tried to use that phone. He is right. If I take it really seriously, I could have come with some solutions.

I think that I am really a reckless asshole without a sense of responsibility. I feel guilty, but have no idea what to do. I only said sorry, and I just let him to express his emotion and thoughts to me, but I don't know to reply what which is appropriate and can help him.

He asks me what to do, but I don't know.

**1st Edit:**

I think my relationship with him is going to end. He sent me many messages and said it was just an excuse that I could not use other devices. I don't want to blame him here.

I have witnessed four breaks between him and his friends like this. I am kinda of a ""slow"" person. Still, through my interaction with him and his interaction with others in the past, I guess that he will believe in a thing stubbornly (e.g. he thinks that another person thinks in this way while they actually thinks in another way, but I am not sure how another person really thinks). This is probably because of his mental illnesses (e.g. ADHD). I think that our relationship is going to end because of this characteristic of him two months ago when I witnessed the last broken friendship, but I just didn't predict that it would come so early.

I understand (maybe not understand, just sympathize because my life is way better and luckier than his) him, and I thank him for his help. Maybe I post this just to make myself feel less like an asshole, or maybe we just cannot be friends in a long span because I am ""healthier"" and luckier. I cannot give so much care that he needs.

**2nd Edit:**

Think you. Finally, his partner forgave him, and our friendship did not end either. He said he forgave me, and I am his best friend (in a certain range), but he won't trust me as much as before. Both of us don't think we will back to before. His partner is still mad at me because I did more outrageous than him in this event.

I don't know if they are right. In the past, they also pointed to some of my characteristics but I don't think so. Maybe I am just not aware of them, or maybe they are wrong. They are pretty smart and talented (although I am not stupid as well), but maybe they are not always right on things that they insist on and believe in.",Asshole,2024-07-22,"AITA for causing troubles for my friend TLDR: I probably messed up my friend's relationship and made his illness worse.

124,1e95n9v,AITA? I don’t want to resolve the issue with my partners best friend’s girlfriend ,"Am I the a**hole for how I reacted and not wanting to ‘resolve’ this?

This is a long one but you need some backstory.

My boyfriend’s best friend’s girlfriend has had a problem with me since day 1. 

In the early days, every time we were to all hang out or be in a party scenario, she would make awful comments on me and I would just ignore them. She’s also the type of person to ensure at every party she cries and gets the attention of everyone for whatever the sad reason was that time. I didn’t particularly like her due to her comments on me but kept civil. From observation over the years she is also not a girls girl and likes to try to be extra close to all the guys in the group instead of talking to any of the girls, always having a favourite guy, making a point of loving the boys, being a little bit all over them, but again this is something I’ve always ignored and I’m only putting this info here so you can get a sense of her personality. 

Years later, 3 to be exact it was found out that my boyfriend had told his best friend and her awful lies about me. (He was going through mental health issues, it’s never really quite clear as to why he lied but me and him have since worked this through). At a party, it was cleared up that my boyfriend had lied, and none of those things were true. The best friends girlfriend and I chatted for hours, both in tears as she had been awful to me all this time because of the lies and I had no idea. Ultimately we concluded my boyfriend was the issue, we had a power to the girls moment and my boyfriend and I took a long time working through and getting over this. 

Every time we have all hung out since then, she has been extremely anti-social. She doesn’t acknowledge me, she whispers to her partner the entire time even to the point of me directly talking to her and her ignoring me and whispering to him. We’ve invited them on camping trips which they didn’t attend, we’ve invited them to our engagement party which they didn’t attend (I was very reluctant to invite her due to this drama and her habit of making drama and needing attention but it’s his best friends girlfriend  so…), and several other things in which either just the best friend has attended or not at all. All the time she is anti-social, ignoring me and whispering to her partner I have just brushed it off and not said anything. She also really judges me for smoking (I only smoke when I drink socially) as she is fully against it however doesn’t give the same judgment to “the boys”. 

Fast forward to the present.

We had a party recently at there house. I asked my now finance several times to ensure that I was welcome. I was. This party had my finances main friend group as well as there partners who I am really good friends with. These partners have also had small issues of being not acknowledged and ignored in the past but just brush it off as well. 

I was standing in the hallway talking to someone and overheard my finance talking with the girl. I only started listening as my partner said he was a c**t over and over and I wondered what he was referring to. I listened in for a couple minutes and she had re-dug up the issue from literally 5 years ago. The issue of how she feels about me. How she feels isolated from the main friend group because of this issue. How she has never gotten over it. My partner was just saying he was a c**t over and over and trying to get out of the conversation without hurting her delicate feelings (she would cry if he would have said he did not want to talk about it). 

 I walked back in and aggressively asked “what the f**k is your problem, tell me what your problem is so I can fix it” with a raised voice. She said she feels isolated because of 5 years ago, I said the only thing I don’t like about her is this exact situation and her having a problem with my relationship, she kept saying she is isolated, I kept saying it’s on her to get over it because this exact thing is the issue,no one cares about it but her, it went in circles. I ended up saying that it’s going nowhere and for us to pick a date to all sit down and talk this out for good when we’re sober, I was so done and I left.

She was sitting and crying (not unusual, she cries over anything) and I looked like this big villain, raising my voice and being black and white. I didn’t have the energy to spend hours nicely fluffing about her feelings about me and a touchy issue about my own relationship. 

It’s been a week, she hasn’t reached out, my finances best friend hasn’t reached out and I feel this pit in my chest that I was, the a**hole. I don’t regret how I reacted because I have put effort in for 5 years with somone who has been very disrespectful to me on so many occasions and she needed to see how an issue that happened between me and my partner literally years ago is not for her to bring up. It’s not for re-explaining and re-concluding. It’s done. My finance and I took months, maybe even a year working that through, it’s a touchy subject in our relationship and everyone knows it.

Even with all this, I just feel bad for the entire situation happening, it ruined the night for everyone and if I ignored it like I always do then everyone would have continued to have a good night. Everyone was involved and it was a mess. 

Thinking ahead, such as my finances and I wedding, I feel it’s worth making the effort to try to set a day with her and our partners to work out what the actual problem is with her and to fix it once and for all. On the other hand, I’m very over it and also feel no matter how this concludes, she will eventually bring it up again or just continue to be awful towards me. 

Am I the a**hole? Do I put effort in to re-establish the situation, dig up the hurtful past of my relationship with her, have my partner re-state he lied and in his words was a c**t? Do I sit there and listen to how she doesn’t like me for things that have been cleared up years ago as not being true? Do I listen to her say how she’s isolated even though she’s been invited and either doesn’t show or ignores me? Do I make the effort of trying to make things right for the sake of my partner and his bestfriend? 

AITA for not wanting to?

My partner is fine for whatever decision I make.

125,1e95m97,AITA for being “disrespectful” to my mother during dinner?,"
One thing you should know is that I’m quite shy. Besides to my parents, siblings, and close friends, I don’t speak up unless talked to first.

One day, my grandmother, mother and I (16F) were hanging out at her place. My grandmother is undoubtedly an incredible cook, so she made a whole fancy meal for me and my mother.

Again, I am shy. So I weakly gave her a nod and whispered, “Thank you for the meal.” I’m not sure if she heard me, but she grinned at me so I assume that she did.

As I started to eat, my mother placed a piece of fish on my plate and told me, “Eat a lot. It’s healthy for you.”

I smiled at her in thanks because my mouth was full of food.

So, my grandmother was watching the whole thing and she seemed fine with it. I mean, what was there not to be fine with?

Anyways, when I got home, my mom got a phone call from my grandmother. She was crying. My mother asked what was wrong and my grandmother started to talk bad about me. She said I was so “disrespectful” for just eating without offering food to my mother once, let alone bothering to tell her to eat a lot as well. She also told me it was rude of me not to thank her for dinner. Which I did, but whatever. She didn’t hear me and I couldn’t do anything about that.

Since then, I always made sure to tell my mother to “eat a lot.”

126,1e957jz,AITA for forcing my husband to make a choice,"I've been married for many years at this point &  have always felt like an outsider with my husbands family. I feel I've never actually been considered family by them.

My MIL insisted upon booking an expensive cruise in an exclusive room knowing h & I really couldn't afford it. I expressed concerns to h but brushed them off. The important part is this coincides with our wedding anniversary.
MIL booked an accessible room for my needs with 1 bedroom & pull out couch. H & I would get the bed & she would share the pull out with her adult child. We were both gainfully employed at the time, but I got laid off.
I kept telling h we simply couldn't afford it but insisted he would pay but couldn’t. H claimed one of his siblings paid for it because they want both of us to go. I found this out of character for this particular sibling. 
2 months before we had questions about the accessibile room. We called the cruise, went over the concerns & also offered to upgrade the room to a 2 bed/bath at a reasonable cost. MIL refused as she didn't want to be in an aft room. Shortly after that I found out I was removed from the lead position which offered us benefits (free dinner at a restaurant for both h & I on our anniversary, etc) & I stopped getting email for my accessibility needs. When I asked h why since we were already short on money & had agreed to spend our anniversary alone for a dinner, h claimed I was removed to use more travel vouchers to reduce the cost. H would pay for the extras. 
Month out of the cruise MIL tries to talk me out of the cruise she was paying for because ""she's not made of money"". She had the nerve to say ""you'll be fine spending your anniversary by yourself right? It's important for me to have my family there."" I held my tongue as h walked into the conversation & said he wasn't going without me. She also revealed I was moved to the 4th position because ""it was cheaper & wouldn't be losing money on my passage if I cancelled"". 
Last week MIL demanded to be in the bedroom & we were sleeping on the couch. Now I am disabled, live with severe chronic pain due to a genetic disease & have serious mobility issues. All things she is well aware of & the accessable room was booked specifically for me. I told h I was done & wouldn't be doing vacations with them anymore. H said was fine sleeping on the couch. I said MIL is trying force me off the cruise as she really doesn't want me there nor to pay for me. H swore it was not the case.
Yesterday I found out I was removed from the cruise. H  claims there was only talks about it. I am NOT ok spending our wedding anniversary alone while he is on an 8 day cruise! I don't want to be alone on a day that should be important to both of us equally.
I demanded h to stand up to his family & tell them they need to respect his wife & our anniversary is important to him. If I don't go, h also would not go. If he didn't I want a divorce. AITA?

Mind you, my mother works in apartment management and we have always lived on top floor apartments. She knows both how tenants can be aggressive and has never below someone.

128,1e94pig,AITA for making my sons take all their stuff to their mother's?,"Hello Reddit, this is a burner account because I think my sons read Reddit.

I am a 45 year old dad of three. My two boys are 19 and 18 and my daughter is 17. The boys are out of high school, the older one graduated in 23 and the younger one just this June.

The older one goes to college but is staying with his mother (we are divorced) for the summer. The younger one as I said just graduated. Right after he graduated, probably a day or two later, I told him that now that he is 18 and out of school he needs to decide if he is going to live with me or with his mother, and he needed to decide and let me know by July 1. For reference, my daughter lives with me one week and her mother the next and that is what my sons did when they were in high school as well. Well, July 1 came and went, and I did not hear from my son. So on July 2 I packed up all his stuff and his brother's stuff in trash bags and boxes and set it in the front yard. Then I texted them and told them they needed to come get their stuff. They asked why and I said that if they chose their mother over me then I don't want their stuff in my house. I even packed up my younger son's pet snake and told him to take it to his mom's house, which he said he couldn't do because they already have a dog and two cats.

So anyway I told them to come get their stuff or I would throw it away. It took them each three trips in their cars to haul all their stuff away because this stuff has been in my house for 12 years so there's a lot. And I made sure the younger one took his snake. Well, after they took everything away I got a call from their mother. She said she was ""livid"" and said that she does not have room to store all their things. I told her that they live there now so it is her problem. She said that they already have things at her house because they've gone back and forth for 12 years so there is no place for two houses worth of things. I again told her that they live there now so the boys stuff is her problem. She  then said I had no right to send another live animal to her house without asking. I told her it is my son's pet so it needs to stay with him. She called me an ass,  and asked where she is supposed to keep all the things? I told her there is a shed and a garage, they can store them in there. She called me an ass again and said I have no right to dictate how she uses her storage space in her home. I told her it used to be my home too so I do have that right. She then said that she loves the boys so will help them figure out what to do with all their stuff but that does not mean she agrees with what I did. I told her she doesn't have to agree, if the boys live with her then so does their stuff, and that's it. She hung up.

So am I an AH like she said?",Asshole,2024-07-22,"AITA for making my sons take all their stuff to their mother's? Hello Reddit, this is a burner account because I think my sons read Reddit.

I am a 45 year old dad of three. My two boys are 19 and 18 and my daughter is 17. The boys are out of high school, the older one graduated in 23 and the younger one just this June.

The older one goes to college but is staying with his mother (we are divorced) for the summer. The younger one as I said just graduated. Right after he graduated, probably a day or two later, I told him that now that he is 18 and out of school he needs to decide if he is going to live with me or with his mother, and he needed to decide and let me know by July 1.

We where raised by our single adoptive mother for all of our lives, no issues. We had some teenage shenanigans but who doesn’t? 

         Last year put mother fell sick with kidney cancer at the age of 63. Although had progressed Into stage 4 by early July . She had had pains for a majority of the year but had chalked up to old age and pushing people on wheelchairs at post retirement job. She was stubborn. 

      Both me and sister took care of her up until she passed in August, 2023 (3 months after diagnosis).

        Fast forward ever since then, I’ve continued working my 40 hr a week job which pays relatively well, to pay for all utilities in the house, along with property tax, groceries. I’m a quiet guy, I don’t party. I might have a friend over 1,2x a month along with my girlfriend on weekends who helps me around the house with chores and little things I may need motivation for.

       My sister had failed her JR year of high school due to missing over half the year. Obviously taking this hard at a young age. She is doing summer school but ever since the death of our mother, she has had people at the house close to every single day. Smoking, drinking and blasting loud music. Has led to keeping me up at night. 

            She has a summer job but pays no bills. Blew through her half of a smaller life insurance policy in 2 months (7000$)

          She’s moved her boyfriends Into the house, and has upwards of 4-5 people there on weekends. She broke up with a boyfriend of about 6 months, and about 2 days later started inviting over another guy, and he’s been here for about a week. These are people with homes and parents.

              It’s been multiple times where it’s gotten to the point where I’ve had panic attacks due to previous instances. I’ve lost my temper and kicked everyone out and she’s acts like I’m the asshole. The house will be put into both of our names. But I can’t live with the immaturity of her having teenagers over drinking and smoking every single day. 

          What should I do? Am i the asshole? I’ve tried talking to her but the same shit keeps happening.

I understand that it is very early on in our relationship and am in no way trying to rush a marriage. I said yes so we went to the mall and into Kay Jewelers.

They were both around 5k and I believe it’s steep for a ring. Anyways I enjoyed our time and after we were done and in the truck ready to leave we got into an argument that continues to come up again and again. I said how I loved getting to look at the rings and that I would want one in the rectangular shape one day. He asked me a hypothetical like “well what would you do if I got you a fake ring, not marry me?” I said that I would want a real (lab grown or not) diamond ring in the rectangular shape but didn’t say a price or anything. He got agitated at me and said I was being ungrateful and don’t love him if that’s all I want. This was also after he got a 50k check for the accident he was in for several months back. He said he’d use some of that money to get me a ring but now has decided not too. He bought a very new truck for over half that. I didn’t ask for anything or for him to buy one in the store… I told him whenever he asks to marry me I’d want him to ask my dad for my hand and show him the ring. I understand it was a lot of money but all I’ve told him is that I want a real diamond.. I might be in the wrong and if I am I would truly like to know so that we can end the argument.

133,1e947jv,WIBTA for accusing my mom of treating me and sibling like kids? ,"Sister (19F) and me (20F) went to a barbecue place I suggested so she could unwind after her tedious schoolwork. We had a lot of fun so I told my parents about this restaurant later on. Mom was very persistent about wanting to check it out and try the food so I thought okay we should go. Before the whole thing tho, sister and I were already joking about the list of things my mom would complain about regarding the place: bad food, cheap, etc etc since we already know from experience that she tends to dislike most things that we like. However since it was a family bonding type of thing, I told her we’ll just suck it up and she’ll prob like it too. 

We came to that place and mom hadn’t even sat down and she was already frowning, shaking her head & clicking her tongue. At first I thought: okay, she doesn’t like the place. This is because the restaurant is at the second floor of a somewhat sorry-looking building but the place is nice in itself. I thought it didn’t matter much because we already experienced a restaurant like this where they serve food at the basement of a building. The place however is so nice and pretty well-known so I was sure it was safe. My mom didn’t bother hiding her displeasure at us but she was all smiles at the servers then back to scolding us. I was so annoyed at her because she was acting so snobbish to the point that she was spitting some of the food on her plate and wasn’t smiling, calling it tasteless etc. I’m gonna admit that I’m also an AH cause I do this exact thing when we’re out and I don’t like the place so I’d be a hypocrite if I get mad at her behavior. But that kind of attitude would make her upset but then it’s okay for her to do it?

Mom then says afterwards that she likes the place but she said she didn’t like the location. She thinks the road leading to that restaurant was sketchy, dangerous, etc. I’ll be clear that I KNOW THE PLACE. I’m not familiar with it all but I defo did my research on how to navigate my way in and out. Sister told her that she’s been to places that were way sketchy than this so my mom replied ‘that’s ok since you’re with a group (friends) but you two came here on your own’

I accused her of treating us like we were kids who needed them to take us to places. Mom then says it’s not a matter of baby-ing but her being worried about our safety and how we don’t know the place and we could have went somewhere closer to where we live cus it’s pretty far.

Recently, she sent me a long text about how she’s the only one who “works” for our friendship, and how I ignore her now that my sister was born. This is am exact quote from one text she sent: “Because you literally haven't texted me all week! I can't be the only one putting into this friendship”.

She sent that to me on a Tuesday, and the last time we had texted was the previous Wednesday, so she wasn’t wrong, but I had been super busy that week.

Anyways, anytime my mom and I are talking about anything, my aunt think she has to be a part of the conversation. Tonight we were talking about a camping trip I'm planning on taking with my S\O. My aunt then comes out, saying I don't know what I'm doing and that I don't have what it takes to survive out in the wilderness myself.

My mom's friends are competitive and are building a narrative about me by saying ""if she does a master's, it probably means she did not get a job"". A few weeks ago, an aunty said something similar, to which my mom lied saying I had an offer in a different city so we were debating whether I should accept it since the commute is difficult. FYI, I interviewed at this firm, but they are no longer recruiting. My mom used that job to construct her lie. I said she should not have lied since it creates complications, but she said that she didn’t want the aunties to create a narrative.

Yesterday, we picked up another aunty from that friend group to go out. She gave advice on how we should accept whatever comes our way first whether it is a job or master's, implying that doing a master's would mean I did not get a job first. Out of nowhere, my mom mentioned that same job offer and said we were debating whether I should take it. My heart sank because I was not prepared. Suddenly, everyone started a debate and I was about to have a panic attack and felt more worthless than I already do. The aunty said I should accept it as it is hard to get jobs and the city where the job is not that far. I did not know how to respond as I would have accepted this job if I had it. She asked what the commute is like, and I was blank. She then asked how often I would have to go, and I said 3-4 days a week.

My dad responded by saying ""oho"", which is an exclamation in Hindi to express amusement and his tone didn't help. My mom and I were confused because it implied I was dramatic for not wanting the job. When we reached and the others went inside, I lost it and she said that I should have known because she had told this lie to another aunty. I said we need to discuss any lie beforehand. My dad then walked in. I yelled at my parents for lying and called out my dad for making me look like an idiot for not wanting the “job”. He said he tried to make it look like he wanted me to take it to show we had discussed it.

I was too angry to listen. My mom settled it by saying that we can say we rejected it because the role is lab-based, which I don’t want. This sounds off because our reason for considering this offer would be the location.

141,1e92ztd,AITA for telling my sister’s boyfriend to not propose to her?,"Update below

I (28F) have a fraternal twin sister who is dating my fiancé’s (34M) younger brother (29M). My fiancé and I are getting married in September. 

My sister has made several comments about how awful my new last name will be. She has also said similar things throughout her relationship. She told me that should could never marry her boyfriend because she just can’t have this last name. I told her that she doesn’t have to take his last name, there are plenty of women who keep their maiden name when they get married for various reasons. She disagrees and said that she doesn’t want to keep our maiden name, she wants to have a traditional marriage where she takes her husband’s last name. 

Last weekend she went with me to buy clothes for my honeymoon. While we were out I asked her what if her boyfriend proposed to her? They’ve been dating for 3 years now and my fiancé told me that his brother was looking at engagement rings. I didn’t tell her this but simply brought it up in regular conversation since we were shopping for my honeymoon outfits and she kept saying “I can’t wait to try on wedding dresses one day” and the like. 

She told me she would say “only if you change your last name.” I told her that was really selfish of her to give an ultimatum like that to someone who loved her and wanted to marry her. She rolled her eyes at me. So I said “seriously, would you really turn him down because of his last name?” And she firmly said “yes, I just can’t have that name.” So I asked why she was even with him knowing it won’t lead to marriage and she replied “I don’t know”. I just dropped it. 

Yesterday, her boyfriend came over to hang out with my fiancé and pulled up photos of rings to ask my opinion on which one my sister would like. I told him the truth. She won’t marry him. That she will say no if he asks because of his last name. He asked me if she told me this and I told him yes. 

He broke up with her today. He didn’t tell her why but my sister knows it was because of me. Now my aunt and uncle (who raised us) are upset with me and said that it’s going to be really uncomfortable at my wedding for everyone. But, wouldn’t it still have been if he asked and she said no? Should I have just let it play out?

143,1e92mlm,AITA for visiting my friend at work?,"I apologize for the long story, but I wanted to add full context.

I used to be friends with “Josh” in high school. We met freshman year in my English class and clicked immediately, mostly because we shared similar backgrounds. We were close until junior year when he met his girlfriend, “Amy”. That’s when he stopped not only hanging out with me but his other friends.

I ran into him about a year after graduating. We decided to make plans to see each other. I asked Josh if he was still seeing Amy and he said they were on a break. So I figured everything was fine.

We visited an arcade, but the whole time felt like a date. Josh insisted on paying for everything. He also hovered over me and had his arms around me a few times. I didn’t mind until I learned, on the way home, that he and Amy had been together the whole time. She blasted his phone, upset he was with me. 

I decided to call Josh and tell him I didn’t want to continue contact due to the drama. He accepted my request and I immediately took him off social media to further distance myself. 

Fast forward, two years later, I ran into him again at a restaurant that he worked. We chatted for a while and I asked him if he was still with Amy. He was. Later, I found that Josh had texted me and requested to follow me again. 

Against my better judgment, I accepted and continued contact despite Amy still being in the picture. Josh said he wanted to hang out again, but Amy probably wouldn’t allow it (she didn’t). He complained that she wouldn’t allow him to hang out with girls and he felt isolated from his friends.

A few days later, Josh told me one of his pets passed away, but he was still going into work regardless. I asked him about his schedule. He told me he was closing, so I decided to pop in then. I asked him how he was doing and we reminisced about the past. He gave me my food order for free, since it was the end of the night. I asked if I could wait for him outside to continue our conversation. He said it was okay, so I did. 
 
Later, when I got home, I found messages from Amy on social media. She said I was an a-hole. I had disrespected their relationship and creeped Josh and his coworker out by hanging around. I texted Josh to ask him if it was true and he confirmed. He said he wanted to spare my feelings. 

I was confused because I had stopped in to see other friends at their workplaces without issue and they’ve done so with me. I also found out that Amy had been reading our texts.

I ended up loaning them about $130 because I wanted to be kind. They assured me they would pay me back within a month, I was like okay sure.

145,1e92cjj,AITA (alone) for getting frustrated by my wife's accusation?,"My wife and I have two young kids and are pretty stressed lately, but overall we're a very happy family. 

Tonight when I was feeding our five year old daughter dinner, she suddenly started getting upset about something minor and then started saying her head hurt, stood up and said her feet hurt, wanted to watch a movie before bed ""because it would make her feel better"" etc. It seemed like she was putting on a bit of an act, and I couldn't tell for sure, so I played along and was letting her lay on the couch and watch her movie. 

My wife came in a bit later and I updated her on what was going on. We both kind of thought maybe our daughter was just putting on an act about feeling sick, because she was saying she wasn't hungry but she would eat ice cream, and so on. My wife and I kept playfully saying things and looking at each other and smiling about it. 

But then it became clear that she actually was feeling bad, so we gave her medicine, I took her to bed and stayed with her a while. 

Then I came back downstairs to my wife and I was updating her on our daughter, and started telling her about how it all started at dinner time, and I thought our daughter was just putting on an act at first. I mentioned how she said her head hurt, and then she said her feet hurt, and my wife cut me off and said, ""Well maybe she was having body pains"" and I started to respond to say, ""yeah, but at the time I didn't know that"" but my wife cuts me off again and says, ""Don't invalidate how our daughter may have been feeling. You shouldn't assume you know how she really feels."" 

I'm kind of confused, like, my wife and I both clearly were playing around earlier thinking our daughter was playing up how she felt to get ice cream, but now my wife is accusing me of being some invalidating jerk. So I say, ""Okay, that's not fucking cool to say I was  invalidating her when you and me both thought at first that she wasn't really sick.""

Then my wife of course gets upset with that, says it's ""triggering"" to her for me to not believe our daughter when she's sick, because I do that to her, and so on.

149,1e9226t,WIBTA if I didn’t renew the apartment lease with my roommate?,"After graduating college, I'm (24M) rooming with a friend from high school. We used to get along pretty well, since I gravitated towards his existing interests (ie anime, video games, books). These days though, as I'm finding new interests (ie rock climbing, music, fiction writing, going out to bars), we're not nearly as close now. Roommate wise, he keeps to himself and stays clean, but socially it seems like we don't click nearly as well anymore. Jokes don't land and conversations are short and small, if not a little confrontational too. Not a terrible living situation, but not perfect either.

There's more to this though. About three months ago, I told my roommate that I had the desire to move out, so I could live alone instead. At the time, I was upset that we didn't share the same values and interests anymore. Since he isn't as ambitious or as extraverted as I am (he didn't go to college, despite the opportunity to do so and he's had the same job since mid-way through high school), it felt like I didn't have much to learn from him anymore, and that there wasn't any more fun to be had spending time doing the things we used to do together. I was also afraid that because I make more than he does that he would find a way to take advantage of me if he found the desire to do so (he told me once that that was why we became friends in the first place, but claims to have re-evaluated this).

Naturally, he was upset with my explanation, and we determined that I was projecting my insecurities onto him. It took his own words, and some therapy, but eventually, I realized that I was being a pretty judgmental friend. I later apologized and said that I wouldn't end the lease. In hindsight though, while I think an apology was necessary in the lens of friendship, I'm starting to second guess my choice to take back my desire to end the lease.

Since then, I've been spending some time finding different friends that match my values/hobbies more, and I find myself outside of the apartment often to spend time with those people instead of my roommate. One such example, I get along pretty well with my brother, who is now looking to move out from our parents' house. He says he's interested in getting an apartment together once my lease is up. We get along a lot better than I do with my current roommate, since my brother and I both enjoy the same kinds of music and golf, and there wouldn't be as much emotional ""heft"" that I have with my current roommate.

Ultimately, what I'm troubled with is if 3 months is too short a deadline to once again declare my desire to end the lease, on top of the fact that I've flip flopped on this once already.

My last posts were from well over 5 years ago, my Facebook posts go back to my high school and university days. I literary have 0 posts or stories on Instagram. I just browse through them to stay updated for work, news, fashion, sports and my other interests. I don’t even comment on or like any posts of friends and family, even my parents.

The other people who do follow me are either family members, (the usual gossiping type but who would also react negatively if I block them) or people from high school and university that I’m not close with. I don’t want people knowing what I’m up to.

So for these reasons mainly, I feel highly uncomfortable putting myself out there. And I’ve explicitly mentioned this to her everytime she brings up the topic. She can post me or whatever she wants on her pages, those are hers. But I don’t want anything on mine. 

Of course, I completely understand why she and a lot of people find posting couple photos cute and sweet. I wouldn’t be surprised if people here are weirded out by my discomfort with just making a social media post. This is precisely her point, which is why she is a little upset.

151,1e91o94,WIBTA for not forgiving my mom for breaking my plant until she agrees to let us have a conversation about trust.,"I (30m) live at home with my mother (55f). Our situation is amicable; we both agree me paying to rent there or anywhere wound be a waste of money so I've lived here while I save. I mainly contribute by covering bills, internet, and any admin or chores my mom or sisters (14f + 22f) don't want to do. So far the economy has made home ownership a 90° uphill battle so as I've lived at home I've taken on long term projects such as gardening. I love gardening and everyone appreciates what I grow.

My mom loves to throw parties, they can get messy (e.g. broken glass shards around the driveway and garden, people tracking mud inside the house etc) but each year she implements new fixes (e.g. plastic cups and more bin bags, renting portapotties to keep people out of the house) and we all have fun. This year I've been growing tomatoes in the front yard, I've been babying them for months and the harvest yield looks high. Mom has been planning a summer barbecue and I made it really clear during the planning phase people need to be careful around the many plants we have that I've been growing in both the front and back yards. Mom was very much like 'yeah, yeah, quit nagging me.' and I didn't want to be annoying, so I left it alone.

On the day of the barbecue I find one of my cherry tomato plants with is main stem (holding 95% of its grit and flowers) snapped in half, crudely taped onto itself. The party is in full swing so I wait until things die down to inspect the damage and it's completely unsalvageable. I soon find out that my mom broke it by accident and, instead of telling me, quickly taped it together and just hoped that'd fix it.

I'm really upset about this, more because she didn't tell me which ruined the plant's chances of survival because I actually know how to properly tape graft a broken plant. Moreover, as I've been helping with the barbecue setup, I've been on call to let people in the house, which has gotten a little annoying but it's nothing major, and despite calling me 5 times a day to open the front door or the gate for people, she doesn't even bother to call me to help move the plants. She does feel bad about it and has apologised profusely. I'm not mad at her but I am really disappointed and want to talk to her about it but she keeps saying she doesn't want to and that she's sorry. I want to be able to communicate my feelings with her but she feels like I'm just trying to tell her off when she's already apologised and that I should just let it go. The problem is that this whole thing has kind of affected my trust levels and I don't feel comfortable just going back to normal without communicating that to her, but every time I try to say anything she tends to silence me with a wave of apologies and I can't really get a word in.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-22,"WIBTA for not forgiving my mom for breaking my plant until she agrees to let us have a conversation about trust.

So far the economy has made home ownership a 90° uphill battle so as I've lived at home I've taken on long term projects such as gardening. I love gardening and everyone appreciates what I grow.

My mom loves to throw parties, they can get messy (e.g. broken glass shards around the driveway and garden, people tracking mud inside the house etc) but each year she implements new fixes (e.g. plastic cups and more bin bags, renting portapotties to keep people out of the house) and we all have fun. This year I've been growing tomatoes in the front yard, I've been babying them for months and the harvest yield looks high. Mom has been planning a summer barbecue and I made it really clear during the planning phase people need to be careful around the many plants we have that I've been growing in both the front and back yards. Mom was very much like 'yeah, yeah, quit nagging me.' and I didn't want to be annoying, so I left it alone.

On the day of the barbecue I find one of my cherry tomato plants with is main stem (holding 95% of its grit and flowers) snapped in half, crudely taped onto itself. The party is in full swing so I wait until things die down to inspect the damage and it's completely unsalvageable. I soon find out that my mom broke it by accident and, instead of telling me, quickly taped it together and just hoped that'd fix it.

I'm really upset about this, more because she didn't tell me which ruined the plant's chances of survival because I actually know how to properly tape graft a broken plant. Moreover, as I've been helping with the barbecue setup, I've been on call to let people in the house, which has gotten a little annoying but it's nothing major, and despite calling me 5 times a day to open the front door or the gate for people, she doesn't even bother to call me to help move the plants. She does feel bad about it and has apologised profusely. I'm not mad at her but I am really disappointed and want to talk to her about it but she keeps saying she doesn't want to and that she's sorry. I want to be able to communicate my feelings with her but she feels like I'm just trying to tell her off when she's already apologised and that I should just let it go. The problem is that this whole thing has kind of affected my trust levels and I don't feel comfortable just going back to normal without communicating that to her, but every time I try to say anything she tends to silence me with a wave of apologies and I can't really get a word in.",0.0,1.0144720077514648,1,0

So my mom doesn't like it when people grab her wrist or make her feel weight down (like leaning on her) but whenever she gets the chance she always grabs my wrist incredibly hard which for one causes me discomfort because I don't like being touched, but she is always gripping my wrist hard to get my attention for either a hug or to talk but whenever I pull my wrist back and say ""please don't do that"" she gets mad asking why I treat her like shit when I won't let her touch (now I do let her I let her hug me hold my hand and other things I just don't let most other people do that type of stuff) me and she starts breaking down and venting to her friends about how I ""treat her like shit"" but I noticed how sometimes my brother or dad grab her arm or hands to get her attention and talk to her and she instead of asking them to stop, now I'm posting this because this once again happened and she does the same thing roughly grabs my wrist I pulled it away asking her not to do that and she flips out yelling and complaining about how she gets tread so poorly and tells me to go to my room.

153,1e91h46,AITA for telling my sister our brother will never change?,"I (21M) and my sister (16F) recently visited some family on vacation. Part of that family is our brother (20M).

Me and him have a terrible relationship. And while most people agree that it was mostly him, I wasn't a perfect saint either. This is the first time in two years we even spoke to each other.

I spent most of my life trying to be his friend, only for him to throw hatred and insults to my face day in and out... I eventually just gave up on him, at least for now.

Our brother hates losing, at anything, and always throws a fit. So me, him, and our sister were playing a card game with the rest of the family, when he started complaining about sister. Well, she started getting upset at him back, which I get but that will do nothing but cause problems for her. So I told her to drop it. She didn't which caused brother to keep instigating her, which she returned and the whole thing turned into a shouting match.

A few days later, my sister comes to me asking if I ate her food, which I did cause I didn't realize it was hers so I apologized.

Summary:

Sis: It's alright, I know you didn't know it was mine. I just want an apology to show that you have really changed.

Me: That's fair, I'm sorry for drinking your soda... What do you mean?

Sis: Well, seeing as how you and Brother always gang up on me-

Me: Gang up on you? When di-

Sis: Yeah, you and everyone else took his side while we were playing cards.

Me: I did? No, I was just telling you to drop it.

Sis: Uh huh, yeah right. Why do you always do that, defend him? Pick his side?

Me: Wha-

Sis: I was just defending myself!

Me: Yes, but that only causes you problems-

Sis: Yeah but you and everyone else in our family does nothing-

Me: Cause we have tried everything! For years! I have known him for his entire life, and he isn't going to cha-

Sis: Stop interrupting me! Shut up! God you are the worst! You never treat me like a sister, so I'm just gonna stop treating you like a brother.

Me: I was just saying that if you let it go, he would drop it. But you kept talking about it and so he kept talking about it and it became a huge problem! I was just telling you to leave it be so you wouldn't have to go through that.

Sis: Stop, no one cares. Keep being a bad brother.

I decided to walk away from the argument. The whole thing was a louder and messier, but that's the gist

This isn't our first argument. We've argued about me bullying her, so I cut back on the teasing. About our mother, our brother, her dog, how I'm a terrible brother, how I never change, or how I baby her, or that she should be nicer to others.

These are all the same arguments I've had over and over with my brother, and I feel like I am losing my sister too.

The common denominator in both of my sibling relationships deteriorating is me, and while previously while I thought it was mostly my brother, I am not too sure now.",Asshole,2024-07-22,"AITA for telling my sister our brother will never change?

154,1e91e3c,AITA for calling out friends who cancelled plans ,"Me, my bf and my bro are part of a friend group where we all met at comic con and now attend those together, go for drinks and get togethers etc.
This weekend we had a comic con on Sat & Sun, and had planned to have drinks together on Saturday after con and have a nice evening/night all together. This was planned in the group chat for a year for anyone who could make it. 

It only turned out us 3 and 2 others could make it. Person A & person B, who came over together as they’re very close friends. The actual comic con isn’t any good. The only reason us 3 came was because we did this same con & ‘afterparty’ last year and had a lot of fun in the after part.

A & B asked if we could stay the Friday night at the hotel we were all going to stay at, we found an airbnb instead that was cheaper and would allow us to be able to stay Friday night too so we did that. they then dropped out of Friday night.

Saturday, we ask if they’d like to come to the airbnb for drinks etc instead of their hotel, they said yes. (We were still happy to do it at hotel if not) 

they say let’s go for food together once we’ve gotten changed. They left to get ready at 4, we got back to our place at 4:30 and let them know that we’d be a little while, no response. 5:30 we’re ready and let them know. 6:00 they say they’ve been sat and done nothing since they got back, and for us to go for food without them, they’ll be round soon. 

We go get food and bring it back to eat so that we’re there and ready if they come round. I tell them. We hear nothing from them until 7:30 and they say they’re getting food. 8.30 asked for their ETA. 9:00 they say they’re tired and not coming. 

We’re annoyed. So we told them that it was a bit of a d*ck move and unfair. 

Person A sends a defensive and angry message about the fact she has a liver problem that makes her tired after food. She then leaves the group chat (consisting of only the attendees) without letting us say anything else. 

Sunday, we’re all feeling upset and don’t want to go to con. We only go to try find them and talk to them in person. We find them, and person A doesn’t even want to talk to us. We ask why we can’t just discuss this like adults 

Person A then says we changed all the plans by getting an airbnb and not telling them (we told them weeks ago, she just didn’t read the message). And that it’s not all about us. We told them it’s literally the whole point of the weekend and always has been. She also kept saying that we just don’t understand her liver problem. And we kept trying to explain we’re not upset at her feeling tired, or her liver, or her not wanting to come round. It’s the fact we had to pry for any sort of info of what’s happening. And their reaction since then has made us even more upset. 

Person A then storms off and leaves all group chats and that’s the end of it.

they won’t talk to us all I can do is have it all going around my head constantly brewing, and it’s making me wonder who’s the problem here.
