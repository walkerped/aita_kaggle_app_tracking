0,1e9l7xu,Update - AITA for telling my father to get over the vase my son broke?,"After reading your comments, I decided to offer to buy my father a new vase again.

I explicitly told him this would be the last time I'd make that offer. If he said no and continued to complain about it, he wouldn't be allowed to see my son until he'd calmed down. He eventually agreed.

The store he'd bought the original vase from does not exist anymore, so I started doing some research. I found one I thought was very similar at a furniture store near my place. I'd bought vases from them before, so I knew they had great quality.

On Saturday, we went on our monthly lunch at my father's place, and took the opportunity to give him the new vase. He seemed grateful at the time, and had a cute moment with my son as they filled it up with the corks. I thought this was done.

But the next day, my father called me. He had looked up the new vase online and noticed it was ""less expensive"" than he expected. Then he asked, ""are you sure this is the best you could find?""

That's when I said screw it. I'm done with his passive aggressiveness. I told my father we're no longer going to his place for anything. If he wants to see my family, he can come to ours.

He protested, but I held my ground. My father did not communicate his wishes at any point, and still complained about the outcome. I'm done watching my family be accused of being bad people, and I don't want this behavior to extend to my son any more than it already has.

So this is where we stand now. My father doesn't like driving to my place, so I'm not sure about the future of our monthly lunches.

I love my father, but I am extremely disappointed in him. If all this means I will see him less than usual for a while, I might be a little glad. The time apart might be good for us. My greatest concern is my son's relationship with his grandfather, which I will try to encourage.",UPDATE,2024-07-22,"Update - AITA for telling my father to get over the vase my son broke?

1,1e9jul2,UPDATE: AITA for making my family cancel their vacation because i wont watch their dogs?,"Link to the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1e6ls16/aita_for_making_my_family_cancel_their_vacation/).

My brother apologized and we were having a very good and calm conversation. We were getting to a point where I was willing to make a compromise because I finally felt heard.

Then my SIL, who had had an attitude the whole time, snappily said ""okay so what do we need to do to resolve this"". Things started to get heated because I felt her tension and tried to acknowledge it.

I said that I was really hurt by my SILs actions. I left it out of my og post, but she was complaining about helping me clean my house before my wedding. I later found out that she told my dad that I had moldy dishes in the sink and that was humiliating. I said it hurt a lot when I learned she brought it up again as part of her argument why I should watch the dogs. She sarcastically said ""oh so I'M the villain"".

I said ""I feel like from what I have gathered from my parents this past week that you think I'm sabotaging this vacation because I'm jealous that I can't go. And if you think that, you really must not know me, and that hurts."" and she said with the same rude tone as earlier, ""I must not know you because that is 100% what I think."" My eyes welled up because I felt like she had just suckerpunched me, and she looked at me and said ""Here comes the temper tantrum"".

I stood up to leave. Then I turned around again and said over everyone yelling my name to calm down ""If you with all your time, money, and resources, decide to not go on vacation, that is your own decision and not because of me."" I got the hell out of the house and sat in the car until my husband came out.

She was in my wedding. I have been so happy to have her as my SIL. I have been nothing but loving to her. Now I see she doesn't give a fuck about me. I'm gutted. It's clear that she has zero respect for me and probably never even liked me. I'm devastated because my family is everything, and I feel like my relationship with my brother will forever be altered. She is not the person I thought she was, and now I'm not only NOT watching the dogs, but I guess I am also accepting that I don't have a sister like I thought I did.",UPDATE,2024-07-22,"UPDATE: AITA for making my family cancel their vacation because i wont watch their dogs?

2,1e9e1s3,AITA for causing “emotional damage” to my father,"I (ftm16) my siblings, and my dad (52) went on a trip to visit family this past week. 

On one of the days, my cousins/siblings and I decided to go to the mall to get some clothes. I have been out as trans for going on 2 1/2 years at this point. When I was at the mall, I finally decided to get some dress clothes since I don't own any. My family isn't the most accepting at all, and they deny I'm trans at all although I am out and have gotten referrals to start HRT and have gender dysphoria diagnosis. 

My grandpa gave each of my siblings and I 100 dollars to spend at the mall, and if we go over, we would have to pay for it (100% fair and i'm very grateful) 

With my money (as in the money Grandpa gave me), and good sales, I got dress shoes, a button down shirt, a belt, and a pair of pants

I was extremely excited and I liked how I looked in it. To this point, I never had my own, it was always stuff I stole from my sibling or I had to wear a dress/skirt to church. 

We were staying at the mall after we all got our stuff to eat dinner, while I was waiting for my siblings to come back, I showed my dad what I got. He got furious that I would have the nerve to get pants that are 28/30 and they were from the boys section. He told me that they weren't designed to fit me and I looked horrible. He also said I was not a boy, and I needed to stop getting stuff that isn't for me. but He said that I had to return them as soon as possible and practically dragged me back to the store to do the return. 

We finally agreed that I can keep them, and we left to get dinner. 

Today, while we were coming home from the airport, my dad told me I had to pay him back the money I spent on the clothes. He said that I hurt him a lot, and it wasn't my money in the first place to get that type of stuff. I should have gotten regular girl stuff, like he and my grandfather thought I would get. He said I caused emotional distress for himself. I told him no, and he called me an asshole and ungrateful. He also started to complain about how I never wear any of the clothes he gets me in general, like skirts, dresses, girly shorts, makeup, and bras. 

Idk. Maybe he's right, I should have gotten those stuff with my own money.

ETA: I want to say I've also been living as a boy for the last 2 years, although I'm pre-T, I have a baby face and can pass as a 12-13 yo boy. I bind everyday and I use a packer. Almost no one who is a stranger knows I'm trans and I can go into the boys bathroom without anyone batting an eye at me.

The short of it is my boyfriend and I haven't had sex for a year, I pay all of the shared bills expect for food, I do almost all of the cooking and all of the deep cleaning, and now I have been tasked with taking care of his son almost every night thanks to his new job. I tried to express my concerns about his new hours and me not wanting the extra responsibility and he essentially told me it wasn't up for discussion. 

My boyfriend's son plays football and practice is starting back up soon. That means a normal day for me will be getting up at 5am for work, driving 45 minutes home, start prepping dinner (if I'm lucky), drive 45 minutes to get to practice, drive 45 minutes home, finish dinner, clean up after dinner, shower, and then go to bed. My boyfriend will also be working one day every weekend (which wasn't what he told me when he started, he said he would have weekends off) so that means I'm responsible for also getting his son to and from his weekend games (some of which can be up to a three hour drive each way but are typically an hour each way).

For me this means more wear and tear on my car, more money for gas, and a heaping pile of added stress on my plate. My boyfriend said it was unfair of me to think about things this way, and I disagree. He essentially told me if this wasn't something I was interested in doing he didn't see a future with me because it signaled to him that I don't care about his son. 

This whole situation is making me question if motherhood is even something I want to experience. I value my alone time and structure and this new schedule is going to eliminate both of those things from my life. I'm already struggling with depression and I just don't think I'm capable of doing this, especially in addition to all the other issues in our relationship. 

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I's relationship is already on thin ice and now he wants me to assume responsibility for his most nights of the week which is something I don't want to do. ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-22,"WIBTA if I didn't take care of his son?  So I orginally posted in r/offmychest and got one really eye opening response. Orginal post here for further context: https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/uHVoh5EVc1

The short of it is my boyfriend and I haven't had sex for a year, I pay all of the shared bills expect for food, I do almost all of the cooking and all of the deep cleaning, and now I have been tasked with taking care of his son almost every night thanks to his new job. I tried to express my concerns about his new hours and me not wanting the extra responsibility and he essentially told me it wasn't up for discussion.

10,1e90ieu,AITA for confronting my friend group about leaving me out all the time?,"Okay so for some context; I have known most of this group for almost three years now and I met them from dating a member of the group. I had known let’s call him John since my first year of highschool and we were good friends. We started dating after highschool which is when I met the group. 
The group was made up of all guys at the time but I wasn’t bothered by it because we all got along really well. Another member of the group had started dating this girl and many of the guys were apprehensive at first but being the only other girl I reached out to her and we became fast friends. 
Everything was going great until new years. John started inviting his younger sister who’s the same age as me to every party that we had and normally I wouldn’t have an issue w this however she started acting really cold to me whenever I was visiting him so she made me uncomfortable. 
My friends girlfriend got along w johns sister really well so they started hanging out a lot and eventually his sister was invited to every hang out and I started getting ignored. It was gradual at first like they would all plan hangouts while I was at work (I only worked weekends at the time) and they would plan these hangouts for days were I had 10 hour shifts and would ask me to come after work. But I was exhausted and yet I still made it out. 

Anyways, John and I ended up breaking up which was super hard on both of us and it sucked. But we decided to stay friends but after we broke up whenever the group hung out no one talked to me. And in the gcs whenever I was just laying in bed they would all be hanging out and I didn’t even know about it. And this happened a lot turns out they were hanging out every few days and the only time I ever knew about anything was because they would post photos into the group chats that I had made. A few nights ago I broke down to one of my other friends and told them everything that was going on and they said that I deserved better than them. 
Here’s where I may be TA I confronted the group and told them everything I had felt. Including that I knew about all the private hang outs and the group chats they had made without me. Then John then decided to private message me and said that I needed therapy, that he didn’t want me messaging him anymore and that I was going to lose all of my friends. 
So I apologised to the group for saying how I felt and I left all of the chats. I do still have one friend in the group however that I’ll call Steven because he rarely looked at the chats and he actively wanted to hang out w me. So I had told him about all the hangouts they all had and he had no idea about any of them. Turns out that he and I were being excluded as much as each other. And apparently someone in the group messaged after I had left and said “we’ll need to get her back” this was last Tuesday and I haven’t heard a word from anyone except Steven.
