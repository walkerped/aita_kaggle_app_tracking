0,1eaf0zr,AITA For Disengaging From My Family Because Of Unacceptable Of LGBTQIA+ Identity,"As a minor (16) I obviously am still tied to home, but try to have the smallest amount my interaction with my family as possible, and plan on moving out as soon as possible. 2 years ago, I told my parents I was nonbinary, I got very different responses, my mom said “okay” and gave me a hug and forgot, and never brought it up or called me they. When I told my father, he freaked out a bit, I am not really sure what was going through his head, but they both thought it was a phase, and like my mom he made no effort to call me the correct pronouns, and brought it back up a few months later, but honestly it was too awkward so I disengaged for a moment, but he has never brought it up in the last two years. 

I also have had problems with my grandmother who is Catholic, and she excepts Trans and Gay people, but not Non binary, bi, or any combination of aro/ace, nor minors expressing any of the above. We have had many talks about it before but she refuses to use the terms or believe any of these, and honestly the only reason she excepts gay people, is because my mom (her daughter in law) has a sister who is married to another woman, and in my opinion, they are the most amazing people in the world. I have been homeschooled since third grade, but now going into junior year, I am moving to an in person school, and am avoiding them as much as I possibly can, and completely staying out of conversations, I know it really hurts them, but I felt so stuck the last year and a half at home, and I really don’t want to deal with them, this is my first thing on Reddit and I just want to put this somewhere, if anyone reads this please be kind with your comments, I really can’t take much right now.",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-07-23,"AITA For Disengaging From My Family Because Of Unacceptable Of LGBTQIA+ Identity As a minor (16) I obviously am still tied to home, but try to have the smallest amount my interaction with my family as possible, and plan on moving out as soon as possible. 2 years ago, I told my parents I was nonbinary, I got very different responses, my mom said “okay” and gave me a hug and forgot, and never brought it up or called me they.

1,1eab6w8,WIBTA If I made my dad choose me or my half sister? ,"Some backstory, I have two sisters and we all have different dads. My dad is the only one our mom married, and even after they got divorced he stayed “dad” to my other two sisters. 

My eldest sister (37f) has always been a cruel person, but I was raised in a “family means everything” way, and I’ve always just forgiven her since I don’t want to cause my mom any stress. 

She has decided recently to adopt a little boy, who will be my mom’s first grandchild.  Everyone is super excited, and when my mom asked her when we could all meet him, she specified that me (26m) my husband (27m), and my other sister (32f), will not be allowed to meet him.  Me and my husband because “she doesn’t want to confuse him” and “she doesn’t accept our lifestyle” and she didn’t specify why she didn’t want our sister to meet him. 

My mom told her she would refuse to meet her grandson if he wasn’t allowed to meet me, and my sister said “well that’s your choice.”


Honestly, I’m really hurt.  We never got along well (she’s hit me with her car twice, on purpose), but we’re still family and this kid is gonna need people in his life that aren’t in this cult.  So I’ve decided if she isn’t going to allow me to see her family, I’m going to talk to my dad and tell him that he either convinces her to let me see my nephew, and if she refuses, to disown her. 

I’ve never actually cared about sharing my dad before, I love that my sisters get to have a dad, but above all he is **my** dad. 

Everyone in my family is on my side, but I still feel kind of evil holding the only stable dad my sister has ever known over her head.  So yeah, WIBTA?


Edit: yall I don’t WANT to ask him to disown her. I’m asking that he talk to her and only disown her if she decides to stay bigoted above family. 

Second of all, he’s only been in her life since she was 11 and she *does* have her own dad, he’s just kinda nuts and she cut him off at 17. 

Second exit: she told me it’s not because I’m gay, it’s because I’m transgender. So there’s some extra context. 

Alright. I accept you all think I’m the asshole for trying to keep my family mine when she’s doing the same damn thing. I truly think I should’ve done a different community who actually cares about queer matters. Thanks. ",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-07-23,"WIBTA If I made my dad choose me or my half sister?

2,1ea5xm0,AITA for taking the last name of a relative I don’t see much over the last name of my grandma who’s financially supporting me?,"I (18) am changing my name in september for multiple reasons, 1 i’m trans (ftm) so want to legally change my name to my preferred name (Ash) & 2 never liked my last name bc it’s my bio dad’s & he wasn’t that involved in my life. I always said i was going to change my last name when i got old enough &  the plan was to take my mother’s maiden name [dG].

At 15 i first told my mum I was trans, she didn’t take it too well & we basically ignored it. Same happened at 16 & then again in October but that time i was out at school and anyone i really talked to called me Ash, so i told her this wasn’t going to change. Among other “old fashioned” things she said was; “i can’t, in good conscience, with my father watching over me, let you take dG as your last name”. She did try to be supportive (to be fair she’s got a lot better recently) & suggested I could take the maiden name of her birth mother (my bio grandma got pregnant at 17 so gave my mum up for adoption) whom i’m close to but don’t see a lot. Recently i went to visit bio grandma & I talked to her about it. She was completely ok with it & said she’d be proud to have a grandson with that name. She’s always open minded & kind about the whole thing (kinda a shock to me given how coming out to my immediate family went). After that it was set in my mind that I’d take MW.

Here’s the thing. My mum’s adoptive mum has always been around. She lives next door & we are close but I’m not 100% myself around my immediate family so i don’t feel very close to them. Regardless I see my granny a lot & she said she’ll pay my uni fees & has generally been the financial backbone of the family (we’re both extremely lucky in everything we have & unlucky in everything that’s happened. won’t go into it but coming out of another divorce rn. But bc of my granny it’s all going to be ok). & dG is her last name. My mum approached me earlier talking about the name change. She told me that it felt like a “kick in the teeth” to take MW from a grandma who’s never done anything for me financially when the dG grandma is the reason i can afford uni. I brought up what she said in october but she didn’t drop it. 

To clarify, i’ve never talked about my gender with the dG granny. The times i came out to my mum she said i shouldn’t tell her or she’d have a heart attack. But then my mum told her herself & my grandma allegedly replied “i don’t care, i just wish [he’d] had the balls to tell me [himself]” which my mum then agreed with and told me off for. & no one in the family I live with calls me Ash or by he/him or anything, unless it’s to get me to do something (eg mum wanted me to move some heavy furniture for her calling it a “boy job” saying “you want to be a boy right?”). Best I get is how i “dress up like a boy” or get called a lesbian/slur for lesbian. I have an ok relationship with them but they really don’t get it & won’t bother to try. 

But my mum has a point that w/o the dG granny i have nothing.

5,1e9u19u,AITA - I have to fire my friend. ,"So I have a friend who got a job at the same company I work for in a different department than I  oversee. They really needed a job and originally took a position that was beneath their skill set and did really well.

TLDR: After a good amount of time on my team their performance has dropped off and I feel like I'm being taken advantage of because they think that by knowing me outside of work puts them in a safe spot. 

This situation has caused a huge detriment to my entire team and led to the rest of us working long hours while they come and go at their normal time day in day out after doing minimal work each day.
