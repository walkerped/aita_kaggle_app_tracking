0,1eaf0zr,AITA For Disengaging From My Family Because Of Unacceptable Of LGBTQIA+ Identity,"As a minor (16) I obviously am still tied to home, but try to have the smallest amount my interaction with my family as possible, and plan on moving out as soon as possible. 2 years ago, I told my parents I was nonbinary, I got very different responses, my mom said “okay” and gave me a hug and forgot, and never brought it up or called me they. When I told my father, he freaked out a bit, I am not really sure what was going through his head, but they both thought it was a phase, and like my mom he made no effort to call me the correct pronouns, and brought it back up a few months later, but honestly it was too awkward so I disengaged for a moment, but he has never brought it up in the last two years. 

I also have had problems with my grandmother who is Catholic, and she excepts Trans and Gay people, but not Non binary, bi, or any combination of aro/ace, nor minors expressing any of the above. We have had many talks about it before but she refuses to use the terms or believe any of these, and honestly the only reason she excepts gay people, is because my mom (her daughter in law) has a sister who is married to another woman, and in my opinion, they are the most amazing people in the world. I have been homeschooled since third grade, but now going into junior year, I am moving to an in person school, and am avoiding them as much as I possibly can, and completely staying out of conversations, I know it really hurts them, but I felt so stuck the last year and a half at home, and I really don’t want to deal with them, this is my first thing on Reddit and I just want to put this somewhere, if anyone reads this please be kind with your comments, I really can’t take much right now.",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-07-23,"AITA For Disengaging From My Family Because Of Unacceptable Of LGBTQIA+ Identity As a minor (16) I obviously am still tied to home, but try to have the smallest amount my interaction with my family as possible, and plan on moving out as soon as possible. 2 years ago, I told my parents I was nonbinary, I got very different responses, my mom said “okay” and gave me a hug and forgot, and never brought it up or called me they.

1,1eab6w8,WIBTA If I made my dad choose me or my half sister? ,"Some backstory, I have two sisters and we all have different dads. My dad is the only one our mom married, and even after they got divorced he stayed “dad” to my other two sisters. 

My eldest sister (37f) has always been a cruel person, but I was raised in a “family means everything” way, and I’ve always just forgiven her since I don’t want to cause my mom any stress. 

She has decided recently to adopt a little boy, who will be my mom’s first grandchild.  Everyone is super excited, and when my mom asked her when we could all meet him, she specified that me (26m) my husband (27m), and my other sister (32f), will not be allowed to meet him.  Me and my husband because “she doesn’t want to confuse him” and “she doesn’t accept our lifestyle” and she didn’t specify why she didn’t want our sister to meet him. 

My mom told her she would refuse to meet her grandson if he wasn’t allowed to meet me, and my sister said “well that’s your choice.”


Honestly, I’m really hurt.  We never got along well (she’s hit me with her car twice, on purpose), but we’re still family and this kid is gonna need people in his life that aren’t in this cult.  So I’ve decided if she isn’t going to allow me to see her family, I’m going to talk to my dad and tell him that he either convinces her to let me see my nephew, and if she refuses, to disown her. 

I’ve never actually cared about sharing my dad before, I love that my sisters get to have a dad, but above all he is **my** dad. 

Everyone in my family is on my side, but I still feel kind of evil holding the only stable dad my sister has ever known over her head.  So yeah, WIBTA?


Edit: yall I don’t WANT to ask him to disown her. I’m asking that he talk to her and only disown her if she decides to stay bigoted above family. 

Second of all, he’s only been in her life since she was 11 and she *does* have her own dad, he’s just kinda nuts and she cut him off at 17. 

Second exit: she told me it’s not because I’m gay, it’s because I’m transgender. So there’s some extra context. 

Alright. I accept you all think I’m the asshole for trying to keep my family mine when she’s doing the same damn thing.

2,1ea5xm0,AITA for taking the last name of a relative I don’t see much over the last name of my grandma who’s financially supporting me?,"I (18) am changing my name in september for multiple reasons, 1 i’m trans (ftm) so want to legally change my name to my preferred name (Ash) & 2 never liked my last name bc it’s my bio dad’s & he wasn’t that involved in my life. I always said i was going to change my last name when i got old enough &  the plan was to take my mother’s maiden name [dG].

At 15 i first told my mum I was trans, she didn’t take it too well & we basically ignored it. Same happened at 16 & then again in October but that time i was out at school and anyone i really talked to called me Ash, so i told her this wasn’t going to change. Among other “old fashioned” things she said was; “i can’t, in good conscience, with my father watching over me, let you take dG as your last name”. She did try to be supportive (to be fair she’s got a lot better recently) & suggested I could take the maiden name of her birth mother (my bio grandma got pregnant at 17 so gave my mum up for adoption) whom i’m close to but don’t see a lot. Recently i went to visit bio grandma & I talked to her about it. She was completely ok with it & said she’d be proud to have a grandson with that name. She’s always open minded & kind about the whole thing (kinda a shock to me given how coming out to my immediate family went). After that it was set in my mind that I’d take MW.

Here’s the thing. My mum’s adoptive mum has always been around. She lives next door & we are close but I’m not 100% myself around my immediate family so i don’t feel very close to them. Regardless I see my granny a lot & she said she’ll pay my uni fees & has generally been the financial backbone of the family (we’re both extremely lucky in everything we have & unlucky in everything that’s happened. won’t go into it but coming out of another divorce rn. But bc of my granny it’s all going to be ok). & dG is her last name. My mum approached me earlier talking about the name change. She told me that it felt like a “kick in the teeth” to take MW from a grandma who’s never done anything for me financially when the dG grandma is the reason i can afford uni. I brought up what she said in october but she didn’t drop it. 

To clarify, i’ve never talked about my gender with the dG granny. The times i came out to my mum she said i shouldn’t tell her or she’d have a heart attack. But then my mum told her herself & my grandma allegedly replied “i don’t care, i just wish [he’d] had the balls to tell me [himself]” which my mum then agreed with and told me off for. & no one in the family I live with calls me Ash or by he/him or anything, unless it’s to get me to do something (eg mum wanted me to move some heavy furniture for her calling it a “boy job” saying “you want to be a boy right?”). Best I get is how i “dress up like a boy” or get called a lesbian/slur for lesbian. I have an ok relationship with them but they really don’t get it & won’t bother to try.

7,1ean5sd,AITA for lying to my niece and nephew about who their real grandfather is?,"Around Thanksgiving this past year I was reading a book to my nephew(4.5) about NASCAR. When I got to the chapter about Dale Earnhardt(Decd) on a whim I thought it would be funny to tell him that The Intimidator™ himself was his real grandfather. I told him some stories of the Winston Cup, the number 3 GM Goodwrench car and of course about the tragedy at the 01 Daytona 500.

I thought he was not old enough to remember this but over the past year it has slowly spiraled out of control.

He has been asking about his “Papa Dale” with increasing frequency to the point of him calling me two or three times per week to ask me how many races his papa won or when papa’s birthday is. I answer him 76 and April 29th respectively but I feel I am in too deep. This has now reached the point where my niece(3) now believes the genealogical lie.

For context my niece and nephew are from a single parent home with their father and by extension their paternal grandparents not present. Their maternal grandmother is present but the grandfather was abusive and fortunately died. Neither of them has ever had a grandfather. I wanted to fill that void with a larger than life American hero.

For even more context I want to say that while I planted the seeds of this idea it has been mostly others in their life that have perpetuated this story. Their mother regularly points out Dale when she sees him, buys books about Dale and keeps up the charade. My friend has been conditioning my nephew to be something of a Manchurian Candidate to eliminate Ken Schrader for his role in the fatal crash.

I am trying to figure out how to back out of this lie but I was wondering am I the asshole or is this all just uncle antics? How do I break the news?

We all also came to discuss how my boyfriend (has adhd) struggles with making inappropriate comments that can be quite harmful. (One example we spoke about was when he used the word 'f*g' in a derogatory way in front of my gay friends. They took it on the chin and understood he meant no real harmful intent however I spoke to him privately about it and he recognised the issue. He claimed it was a joke and I said it was unacceptable).

Recalling that incident, my boyfriend said something along the lines of one of the couple looking like Shrek and in my opinion, insinuating she was fat and ugly. Again, he said it was a joke. He then said, he meant that she looked green - clearly being antagonistic and minimising what he actually meant.

Something inside of me flipped and in front of his friend I told him it was unacceptable and vile to discuss weight in that way in front of people he claims to love who he knows have expressed NOT EVEN AN HOUR AGO their own battles. 

This isn't the first time he has made these kinds of comments and each time I usually leave it until we are in private to discuss, however this time I didnt. I admit I was triggered, and although I was running on emotion I am very clear in my thinking that it is completely unacceptable and I can not tolerate it anymore. This girl has done nothing to him and she's only ever been lovely. I can make allowances for the issues that adhd can sometimes bring, but I cant not call out nastiness. 

His friend then left the house, saying thay he was triggered by our argument as he's going through a breakup. I apologised massively and he actually said he agrees with me.

My boyfriend is pretty avoidant and so shut down, most likely feels embarrassed that was in front of his friend and also shame at what he said. The usual pattern is his knee jerk reaction is to say his comments are jokes, however once I hold him accountable, he then realises and understands the impact it has. Jokes are one thing, but having self awareness for the people around you when saying jokes is another in my opinion. AITA and did I overreact?

11,1eamg98,AITA For Slamming the Door in my BFs Face to Save Him From Inhaling Toxic Chemicals ,"So I (21F) am a doll customiser (mainly working with old Monster High dolls). What I’ve come to realise is that this is actually quite a dangerous hobby with exposure to a lot of hazardous chemicals, like resin and toxic sealant sprays. This morning I went out onto the balcony and closed the (sliding) door to seal a paint job. I use this spray lacquer which is the Aussie equivalent to MSC. It’s incredibly toxic if inhaled and I’m supposed to be wearing a gas mask and eye goggles (I usually don’t, which I know is bad). I was in the middle of spraying when my boyfriend (22M) opened the balcony door to try and tell me something. I swung around and in fear for his safety yelled at him to close the door. He was confused and just stood there for a little bit so I yelled again. He looked really upset and backed up, so I ran over and slammed the door. I finished spraying the doll and then went back inside. I asked in a calm voice “what did you want to tell me?” and he dejectedly replied “it doesn’t matter”. I kept prying and he told me that even if it was for his own safety I could’ve been less aggressive and said something like “hey please close the door for your own safety this stuff is toxic”. Like, yeah I could’ve been more polite but in the moment I was scared that he was gonna inhale the fumes and needed him out of there immediately. I care for his safety more than my own.

12,1eamatt,AITAH for asking for a gift back? ,"AITAH for asking for a gift back? 

Late last year, I had a rocky time with my ex- looking back it was a complete discard. We decided to remain “friends”. He told me that he was going to get me something special for Christmas to give back for all I’ve done for him (I paid for everything in the relationship and he had never got me a gift before). 
Being that I felt discarded, I guess I emotionally held onto the idea of him giving me a gift to show me that he actually did care on some level. For me, it wasn’t about an object but what it represented. 
I bought him a silver chain for Christmas and gave it to him a couple of weeks before hand because he had an event that he was attending and I wanted him to be able to wear it. I told him that I wanted to give him something sentimental from me. 
Christmas comes and he got me NOTHING. 
I stopped speaking to him after that, but in June we decided to see if we could maybe make a friendship work. 
He’s 38 years old (I’m 41). One day at work, a 20 year old girl came to me almost in tears because he had been creeping her out. She told me that he had been trying to flirt with her and that he had even given her a gift. 
I spoke to him about it and he said that he wasn’t trying to pick her up (sure) and that he only gave her a gift because she had given him a little bag of chocolates at Christmas and he wanted to show appreciation for it, it just took him until June to actually give her a gift. 
I said to him “yet all that time you knew how hurt I was that you didn’t follow through with your promise and you didn’t bother yet here you are giving gifts to a 20 year old that you barely know”. 
Honestly, I’ve spent thousands on this guy (my bad really)
So I asked for the necklace back (which he still continues to wear with no shame even though I told him it felt like a slap in the face). 
My psych thinks he’s a complete narcissist and I’m trauma bonded so please be gentle. I know where I’ve gone wrong in spoiling a man that never deserved it.

13,1eam7id,WIBTA If I limited time with my dad after he took my brother and left me in a different state?,"So I (15F) have divorced parents who's only biological children are me and my older brother. Both have remarried, my dad to my stepmother, whom he had two daughters with, and my mother to my stepfather, whom she had two sons with. I live with my mom mainly, and got to my dad's house every other weekend with a two and a half hour drive.

My older brother and my mom started to get on rocky footing as my brother turned into a teen. As one of the options, my mom had offered to let him get a clean start by moving in with my dad a few times, and he refused.

Yet, we went to our dad's house one weekend, and the Friday night that we arrived, my  dad explained that my brother was to be moving in with them and not returning home that Sunday like normal. I assumed both parents knew and had decided not to tell me until the last minute. I was a little hurt, but whatever.

Well, that was NOT the case.

I found out when I returned home alone Sunday that my dad had told my mom just before he told me, had done no legal custody switch, and went to a dinner with my mom where my brother lied the entire time and my dad backed him up.

That brings me to recently, where four months into living with dad, my brother comes for his monthly visit and tells me that he and my dad's family are moving several states away (10 hour drive, 3 hours by plane). I call my dad upset; he claims he was just too busy to call me before and assures me he can fly me out whenever. This ended up being grossly inaccurate.

He moved for his work, but now we're even more split as a family, and it's been really getting to me. I can only fly out on school breaks given flying takes a whole day with the layover, yet I'm brushed off anytime I try to bring it up.

This summer was my breaking point though, my brother only came down for a week because he got a job, he spent the entire time hiding in his room, barely talked to anyone, was mad when he was asked to socialize, and my mom didn't complain to my dad or to my brother.

However, when I wanted to take a trip to see my cousins that would be about a week, and my dad talked me out of it because it would change his 5 week time to 4 1/2 weeks. Yet, when I was there, he was working most days, and that first week I may have missed? I spent the time with my stepmom and her family and didn't see him.

Now, I'm going to be getting a job soon and as much as I love my younger half-sisters and don't want to disappear from their lives, I'm thinking to only really go to my dad's in the summer and Christmas. I feel like the AH for considering it given my younger sisters are free of blame and I know how my mom's side of the family felt when my older brother cut down his time by moving.

14,1eals0h,WIBTA for ending a friendship over lethal company ,"for context, I (20F) have been friends with J (20M) for about a year now. My boyfriend and I met him through mutual friends and started playing games and talking on discord almost every night. At the time me and J would also go to the gym together and work out together. We became close and where close friends before Him and my boyfriend where, at one point J even said that if my boyfriend and I broke up he was more my friend then his and that wouldn’t change. 

My work schedule changed and J started going to the gym with my boyfriend when i couldn’t, and then slowly only him. Which i was fine with it was cool that we could all be friends and hang out which is what i thought was gonna happen when those two got closer. 

After some time J got strangely attached to my Bf, kept saying stuff like “no i actually see him as a brother” after only being real friends for like 2 weeks. And he started being passive aggressively rude to me, like undermining me in discord calls, making cruel “jokes” at my expense, and talking about me to our other friend behind my back. All of that i wrote off as just his personality cause he does tend to be more rude than the average person. 

some of the stuff kept bothering me so i talked to J about it and he was not very caring/apologetic at all. Also just for an example of something he said as a joke. There was a time my boyfriend, J and myself where at the gym, and me and J were talking about our individual insecurity’s and what we wanted to work on. A big thing with me is that i felt like i wanted a more feminine frame. Not twenty minutes later he looked me up and down while i was doing pull downs and i asked what he was thinking and he went “You look like a man”. 

he didn’t take me being bothered over the stuff seriously until my boyfriend got upset at him about it. At the time his apology to me seemed genuine but looking back it seems he only did it to get back on my boyfriends good side. 

I normally really don’t care about like playful banter or like jokes with friends like that but J would constantly call my boyfriend either crying or just really pissed off complaining about his physical appearance, or his feelings being hurt because our friends in discord would “do a voice” and mock him and apparently that was another thing he was insecure about. He continued dumping on my boyfriend like that for months before my bf couldn’t mentally handle it any more. And J only talked to me to 1. complain about my bf not talking to him or “being mean” (which really meant just being honest and calling him out on stuff) or 2. t complain about everything to me when my boyfriend couldnt be there to listen. 

This all culminates to thursday night. Me, My boyfriend, J, And two other friends where playing lethal company and J was complaining the whole time about not being able to drive the company cruiser. He legit kept saying the same thing over and over again which was “all i wanted was to drive the cruiser just one time” (which he had multiple times either way just a stupid thing to harp on). He continued to harp on it over and over, i said I didnt want to hear it and he kicked me from the call. I was put off so instead of joining again i just went to sleep. That was the last time I had any interaction with him. 

The next night he called my boyfriend and was complaining about me “ignoring him” and my boyfriend said it was because he was being rude, told it wasn’t fair for him to expect every one to be so delicate about his feelings and then literally not care at all about any one else’s. This prompted J to say he wasn’t sorry and wasn’t going to apologize. He called my boyfriend again the next day and spoke like every thing was norma, and when he noticed my boyfriend was still upset he just hung up to go lie about my boyfriend being “mean to him” to our other friend. 

The thing is I know if i text him or call him and say everything is fine then every one will go back to normal.

We recently moved into a new apartment together and have been enjoying our space and the freedom that comes with it. It’s a cozy place, perfect for the two of us. Jake’s sister, Emma (25F), has always had a messy life. She’s struggled with keeping jobs, has had a lot of short-term relationships, and makes bad financial decisions. Despite this, she’s a sweet person, and I’ve always gotten along with her. A month ago, Emma lost her job and then her apartment. She asked Jake if she could move in with us for a while to get back on her feet. Jake brought this up to me, assuming it would be a straightforward yes. However, i had my reservations. Firstly, our apartment is small, and having another person, especially one who’s known to be messy and irresponsible, would change our living situation a lot. We have a nice routine and balance that i feared would be messed up. Secondly, i work from home, and the thought of having someone else in our space during the day while i’m trying to concentrate was not appealing. Lastly, Emma has a history of overstaying her welcome. She’s done it with friends and other family members before, promising it would only be a few weeks, which turned into months. i expressed my concerns to Jake, suggesting that we help Emma find another solution, like helping her with a security deposit for a small apartment or even suggesting she stay with their parents for a while. Jake didn’t take it well. He argued that family helps each other out and that Emma wouldn’t have asked if she didn’t really need it. He assured me it would only be for a month or two, but i wasn’t convinced given her track record. The argument got worse when Emma called me directly, crying and saying she had nowhere else to go. i felt terrible but stood my ground, reiterating that our place was too small and that it would be disruptive for both Jake and me. She hung up, and now she’s not speaking to me. Jake is furious and has been giving me the cold shoulder, saying i’m being selfish and unsupportive. He moved into the spare room we use as an office and has been staying there most nights.

16,1eal89x,AITA for telling my roommate to grow the fuck up,"My roommate and I (both 21) are best friends and live together away from home for college and both have our own jobs with decent income on the side. I admit I'm definitely more on the independent side where I like to do everything myself and I'm not very close with my family which makes a lot of my roommate's behavior seem extremely childish to me.

His relationship to his mom seems like, at least to me, how a mother would treat a young teen. She has access to all his emails, bank accounts, etc and would also manage them for him. With the access, I would often see her apply to things for him through his email or constantly put credits into his Uber account for him to use despite his income being more than enough to sustain himself. I would also wake up every other day with random packages at our place from her mom constantly shipping the most random items to him: vitamins, tea, underwear, etc, all of which he has the ability to buy himself if he needs it (he's never told her he needed or wanted any of them and is never aware whenever she does buy anything for him).

There also seems to be an approval system going on. For big or small decisions or actions he needs to take, he could never make any of them unless his mom gives him the ok. Whether that be buying something only worth $10 for himself or when I ask him to plan or book anything, he has to let his mom know and either waits until she agrees or she'll disagree and do everything for him instead.

It also seems like his mom seems to dictate his life. Majority of the time he doesn't know his own plans for the day or week because his mom would be planning and booking without informing him or asking whether he's free and he would be forced out last minute for his things like bank appointment, haircut appointment, etc. This has also affected many of our plans where I would make plans with him (with or without other people), he'd agree, but cancels last minute due to finding out he needs to attend something his mom planned. Even if he were informed in advance, he has never said no even if he already has plans with me or others, and would simply cancel to listen to his mom.

I'm not sure how independent someone at 21 should be, but during one of a similar incident where I felt like his life was constantly getting micromanaged by his mom, I told him he needs to grow the fuck up and stop letting his mom dictate his life. He responded by saying it's not harming him and makes his life easier so why should he change anything. I'm simply baffled by how reliant someone can be on their family and whether I overreacted because I have a skewed opinion on how independent someone should be at 21.

I have several disabilities, I’m deaf, have a genetic disorder that affects my mobility, and have a heart condition. Therefore, I’m not as able to do as many things as my roomates.

I’ve been lectured a ton by housing program staff about cleaning the apartment. My room is a little cluttered, but not messy. I don’t eat at the apartment anymore because they blamed me for my ex-roomate leaving their dishes in the sink for a month. Which means I’m barely eating one meal a day. I’ve been couch surfing at friends’ places for a few weeks now, so I haven’t been present at the apartment much. 

The issue comes up with the fridge. My roommate wants to put her insulin in there, which is completely fair. Issue is, the fridge is packed full to the brim with food. None of that food is mine except for two gallons of milk, some butter, and a few containers of yogurt. The majority of it is my ex-roommate’s. Housing program staff are saying I have to clean the fridge because I’m apparently not doing any housework. I do, I’ve cleaned the bathrooms so many times, taken out the trash when it’s overflowing, cleaned out the fridge twice, and more. 

I physically can’t crouch down and clean the bottom part of the fridge. I’m getting tired of constantly having chores dumped on me, when I already do so much around the apartment. I genuinely feel like a shitty person the majority of the time I talk to staff because every time it’s something negative.

18,1eakk8i,AITA for being mean to my kid sister and holding a grudge? ,"My older brother passed away from a drug addiction when he was 19. He made some really bad decisions and I didn’t see him much the last two years of his life, but I really loved him. I was 15 when he died. 

My parents kicked him out, most of the extended family had cut him off and no one would talk about him anymore. I don’t know if my family just don’t care or if they’re feeling guilty, but they still act as if he never existed. I know that addicts are difficult to deal with. But my family act like that was all he ever was.

My younger siblings are 11 and 13. For context, my 11yo sister doesn’t even consider him a brother because all she remembers about him is that he died. I don’t try to change their opinion on him or force them to acknowledge him. But I do feel upset sometimes when they talk about family or siblings and leave him out. I don’t say anything, it’s my own personal feelings. 

My brother really liked hockey, and he really liked to draw as well. I have his sketchbook and some of his hockey cards and even his jerseys (plus a few other things) in my room. When I came home the other day, I noticed my drawer where I kept the sketchbooks+cards was open and empty (minus a few cards). I immediately freaked out and after looking all over my room, I asked my mom if she knew where they went. She looked super guilty and said that she might’ve seen my 11yo sister with the stuff. 

I immediately went into her room and saw her colouring over one of his drawings with some crayons. I freaked out really bad. And when I saw that she had made a mark on almost every single page I started to cry. Not only that but she had cut out a few pages of his sketchbook and some hockey cards for some scrapbook idea she saw on instagram. I asked her what the hell she was doing and why she took these things without even asking and she bursted out crying. Our parents ran to the room and when I explained what she did they yelled at me for getting upset and that I had no right to yell at her. They told me that “all that stuff is junk” and that she did me a favour and that it’s insane I’m reacting like this. They even accused me of treating my dead sibling better than my live ones. 

I was such a mess and couldn’t stop crying so I just walked away but I haven’t apologized and refuse to. My parents are pretty annoyed because she’s just a kid and I’m too grown to be this mean and resentful of her (she didn’t have bad intentions). But I just can’t.

19,1eakcj0,"AITA because I 27F went to Disney World without my friends despite ""making plans""","I 27F have been wanting to go to Disney world for years. I have only gone once one other time in my whole life and that was while I was in middle school. Now that I'm an adult I want to go back and actually do all of the things that I want to do. 

I shared these plans with two friends who we'll call M and K. for some background M(32F) is an avid Disney goer, she goes about 3 times a year minimum. K(36F) has never been and doesn't care either way. 

Four years ago, the three of us agreed to plan a Disney girls' trip together. Initially, M enthusiastically offered advice based on her deep knowledge of Disney Parks. However, finalizing the year became a sticking point, primarily due to M's prior family plans for each suggested year, which involved her going to Disney. Whenever I joked about going alone, M insisted I should wait so we could all enjoy the trip together and eventually settled on early 2025. Recently, K announced her pregnancy, which altered our plans as her due date coincides with the planned trip, necessitating a reschedule. But I was so happy to be planning a baby shower for her that I was only a little bummed.

When my boyfriend 27M found out about it, the first thing he asked was ""what about your girls trip?"". I told him it was cancelled and didn't talk about it anymore. Little did I know, this pissed him off and he took matters into his own hands. Behind my back, planned a one week Disney trip including Universal studios. For my birthday, he surprised me with a ToT loungefly. (I've never talked about these so I'm surprised he knows what these are). And inside the bag was the confirmation code for Disneyworld, plane tickets, and a note that said he'll buy the universal tickets when the rest of the worlds opened. I was so excited when I told K and M. K was really excited for me asking a bunch of questions about what we were going to do, wanted to see the bag he bought me, etc, but M was visibly irritated. She then asked what happened to our girl’s trip. I said that we have been talking about a trip for years and we could always go after K is more comfortable. M thought it was crap I was going without them, but K pointed out that M goes to Disney 3 times a year so what does it matter that I’m going with my boyfriend. M argued that she has to go because her family lives in Florida and that’s what they do. Eventually we just stopped talking about it and went our separate ways. 

When I talked with my family about it later my sister said that I TA because we have been talking about this girls trip for years and essentially I’m cancelling it all together to go with my boyfriend. She also pointed out that I knew M would be upset if I went by myself, because she told me whenever I joked about it. Which I agree that I might be TA about that

K and my boyfriend are saying that I’m NTA and M has been holding out for years and that I should have gone sooner since this was originally my idea.

I (17F) am autistic. I have things like headphones and medicine to help my anxiety but sometimes they aren’t strong enough. My parents love traveling, especially to big cities. I’ve always hated these trips as they over stimulate me to the point of extreme mental outbursts/breakdowns. My parents never seemed to understand why I was upset no matter how I explained it. Recently they decided to plan a last minute vacation to Santa Barbara and told me three hours before we were supposed to leave. Which is also hard because I struggle with sudden schedule changes (which they know about)We had just got back from a trip to New York City (which was very hard for me.) I cried hours everyday we were there. The car noises and climate were hurting me. Anywho, when I was told the news I had a panic attack and could barely breath.

i invited my friends and my girlfriend, and we had a small party in the basement. in total it was 13 people.

everything was great, we played games, had a lot of food, and everyone had gotten me something i wanted/something that aligned with my interests, and i was super thankful. the problem arises with two of my friends, who i’ll call “abby” (18f) and “grace” (18f). i’m not super close with them due to past issues, but i didn’t want to exclude anyone. 

i opened their gift and it was… something. the first thing was a box with trash animal magnets? i was a little confused but said thank you. the second thing was some candy with ingredients i’m VERY allergic to (which everyone knows about) the last was weight loss supplements and a weight loss book. i have struggled with my weight in the past, and i was hospitalized for a bit during school due to this.

i asked them if this was a joke, and both seemed surprised at my reaction. they said they thought i liked these things (??), and nothing’s wrong. they also said that the weight loss gear looks like i need it nowadays. i kind of lost it and started crying. i went upstairs, and my girlfriend sent everyone home. 

since yesterday, i have been getting texts from some of my friends, calling me a bad person for overreacting. i have been kicked from the group chat that abby made with everyone. 5 of my friends have actually been on my side and are trying to defend me, but everything’s a mess and the group is divided.

28,1eai6ot,AITA for being upset my mum outed me to all her friends?,"I (F, 21) was having a nice day with my mum (F, 45). We got our nails done, sat in a cafe, all that. My mum's friend was at the cafe too, and we had a nice time. Eventually, her friends arrange to meet about 10 mis away to have a coffee. My mum asked me if I wanted to join, so I said sure cause I was having a nice time hanging out together.

We started getting onto the topic of matchmaking, because one of my mum's friend's sons thought that our parents were trying to set us up (because we're of the same religion). I kinda suspected the same thing, but didn't say anything, and that's what spurred on the conversation. I was telling his story of one time I was set up on a date by a religious person without my knowledge and how awkward it was, it's a funny story.

My mum's friend says, ""Next time, say you like girls. Problem solved."" 

My mum, who knows I'm bi, looks at me knowingly, and (in Spanish, not English as everyone was speaking) says, ""she wouldn't care,"" about her friend.

Without waiting for approval, she just turns to her friends, and shouts loudly above everyone talking, ""\[Rheevalka\] likes girls!""

I just look at her furiously. And she turns back and says, ""oh, I'm teasing, I'm teasing.""

The friend says. ""it's fine if she was,"" but that's not the point. She still shouldn't have announced to everyone my sexuality. My mum has also done this before in the past. Blurted out embarrassing/private information about me to all her friends to gain their approval.

When we got home, I barely said anything. She knew I was upset, and asked me if I was in a bad mood. I told her I was angry. She asked why, and I said, ""I honestly don't think you'd care."" So she slammed the door and left. 

At dinner, I was quiet, and my dad could tell I was angry. Mum left to let the dog out, and I took the opportunity to tell him hat happened. He looked so disappointed, and was like, ""If that's true, I'll go talk to her.""

He leaves. I hear arguing in their bedroom. He comes back about 3 minutes later, saying, ""\[Rheevalka\] I think you misunderstood. From the context I heard, it sounds like it was a joke, it wasn't intended badly.""

I told him that screaming I'm gay isn't a joke, and even if it was she shouldn't have done it anyway. I felt extremely betrayed by both of them. My dad proceeded to say that, ""no one would say it like that, that wouldn't happen."" To which I asked him if he thought I was a liar. He replied no, so I countered, ""but you just said that wouldn't happen. Except I was there and you weren't.""

He continued to defend my mum. I told him that I was thinking of going back to my house (I was visiting them for the summer). He told me if that's what I wanted, I should go.

30,1eahuk8,AITA for not having friends over at my house,"Maybe this isnt the right place to ask this, but I want an unbiased opinion. (if this isnt the right place please suggest somewhere else i could ask <3)

TLDR: due to my brother having additional needs, living with a single parent, and my small flat having a bad layout and always being messy, i havent had anyone over in years but often go to my friends house. aita for making too many excuses, or should my friend try to understand better. 

I have a younger brother (5) who has additional needs. he runs around a lot and often has meltdowns, can be very loud and struggles to understand boundaries. 
i also live with my mum who is being assessed for adhd and struggles with hoarding, and as a result of this our house is often messy and kind of embarrassing. 
i live in a 2 bedroom small flat, and my brother (by choice) sleeps in our living room. 
we are looking to move but its taking a long time to find a reasonably priced place to move to. 

the layout of the flat means that the rooms are all very close, and even in my bedroom its not really separate from the rest of the rooms, and sound travels really easily, so i wouldnt feel comfortable sitting with my friend in my room as my brother or mum could come in or hear us at any time.

i am often restricted by my little brother a lot, and many of my friends are understanding of my situation (there are other things that arent relevant to this post) however one friend (L) has always struggled to understand. 
she makes small throwaway comments that make me feel guilty, and recently mentioned that its weird shes never been to my house but ive had sleepovers at hers a lot and her mum often gives me lifts when my mum cant drive me due to my younger brother. 
i tried to explain again the situation, and how if it were easy to have someone over i would, but it would be difficult and stressful. 
we moved on from the topic, but i dont feel like she really understood and now i cant stop thinking about it.

its not impossible for me to have someone over, but nobody has been to mine since my brother was born (due to various reasons) and it doesnt seem worth it when i am able to go to hers with much less difficulty and inconvenience. 
i am very grateful to her and her family, and often feel bad about the amount that she does for me (as i do with most of my friendships). 

when i am able to give back i do, and before my dad got ill and had to stay with other family, my mum would sometimes take me and friends out places for the day, but she is unable to now due to our circumstances.

im wondering if im just making too many excuses and need to find a way to have her over, despite it being difficult.

31,1eahmcv,AITA for asking people to leave a squash court?,"My friend and I play squash every week at our local squash courts. There are 4 courts there and it’s usually pretty busy so people are normally waiting outside the court ready for their 40 minute slot. 

We turn up as usual and two guys are playing on the court. It gets to about 2 minutes until our slot starts and these guys don’t look like they’re finishing any time soon. 3 or 4 mins into our slot they are still playing so my friend asks them how many points they have left to play. One of the guys then turns around, points to the clock on the wall opposite the court and says “we’re playing to that time there”. Looking at the clock it turns out it’s 10 minutes slow, so according to them they had 5 or so mins left. 

Normally I’d have let it go but the guy was really rude and pissed me off, so I told him the clock was slow and he they were eating in to the time we had paid for. He continued to say they were playing to that time so I got my phone out, pressed it against the glass to show him the time and asked them to leave. 

The other guy bit the bullet and left, but the rude fella left and started kicking the bins over, kicking his bag and on the way out kicked the glass wall of the court very hard. 

I’m debating whether I’m the asshole as it was only a couple of minutes over time and meant they couldn’t finish their game, but given the clock was 10 mins slow theoretically they could have played on and used up a quarter of our session that we had paid for.

My friend called me a few ago to apologize.  There was a huge blowup that night when they got back home.  I had driven separately to the restaurant.  My friends fiance handled the situation.  He asked her to explain what happened in her words, apparently he had overheard me ask her for the ketchup before she exploded.

She explained that I am a ""Boomer bitch"".  She hates that she will have to share a bedroom.  She hates her dad is getting remarried.  She hates the dress she has to wear at the wedding.  She hates that everyone except her loves her stepmother to be.  She hates her stepsisters are prettier.  She hates everything.  Her dad explained that he loves her but he also loves my friend and that the wedding is happening.  

My friend ended with that.  No clue what their next move is but I'm out of it, not my place.  I don't know if she'd been showing signs prior that no one noticed?  I feel for her, I do.  I feel for all of them.  My friend and her daughters are like family to me.  Her fiance is a good man too.

Yesterday when I went to the park to go hangout with my friends, noticed that my one friend was slurring her words, and couldn't remember a thing, and was acting crazy. I was soon told by my friend that she had gone to a party with two of her other friends, which in fact I have a struggle with, one because one has shamed me for giving into peer pressure, and the other I didn't know. But she had told me she had gone to this party, and had gotten wasted, as well high. I was kind of worried. To be honest because it wasn't only that she had done. As I was at the park with her and our other friends, the girls she went to the party with showed up. And they were all talking about the party. And which I was kind of concerned, because they had brought up how they took drugs, got high, and drank, a lot. But what concerned me the worst is that when I got told my friend made out with two girls at the party. Which really upset me, because she has a boyfriend. And that really did upset me cause a couple months ago I had gotten cheated on by my ex, so I knew what it was like to get cheated on. So as we were there, I soon decided to go home early because I was gonna hang with another friend. Which I soon consulted to her about how I was worried, and that I knew if she could get away with this once, she would do it again. And as I started to explain my worries, I told her about how much danger she could get in, like getting in a car accident, or taken advantage of. So I told my friend that I felt like i should tell my other friends mom, and which she told me, it was the right thing to do because I was worried, and that this wasn't the person I knew anymore. Well about an hour later after I told her mom, my friend that was with me got a call from a girl that was really close with my friend that was grounded. And she had yelled, and said,"" I'm going to kill her"", which she meant me. I was soon to find out she want no longer able to be around my best friend, and that she had lost her second mom. Soon after that call another friend of mine soon started to text me saying why couldn't I had minded my own business and keep my mouth shut. Which I told him I was worried and then explained things that had happened a couple weeks ago prier before this situation. Now I have lost my best friend, and many other friends, and I feel like I made the wrong choice, even though others are saying I made the right choice.

Met her while at a gas station and moved her in the same month. It was like he was going through a midlife crisis that spiraled out of control. My husband, our 1-year-old, and I lived with my dad at the time, he worked out of town a lot so it benefited all of us. We were able to find a rental and quickly moved out, we had no idea who this woman was and neither did my dad. They didn't last and my dad quickly moved on and started dating someone his age, they got married. We like her a lot but my dad is miserable, my dad is lonely and is still in love with my mom but she is in prison and he doesn't want to wait for her so he is using these women as substitutes in my opinion. 

He started drinking again, this man had been 30 years sober, and he then quit his job. He was able to get another job easier on his body, with great pay, but failed a drug test. He has been jobless for 2 years now picking up handyman jobs when he feels like it. His wife left him. He has let his home become a junkyard thinking he can sell worthless items, the house needs repairs badly, bills are piling up and he isn't paying the house payment. We bought him a phone before we knew all this trying to help him out, barely paid his bill, then he lost the phone, he had insurance so we got a new one for him. If we asked for phone bill money he would ask are you all hurting for money, no but we are now that he won't pay his part. He had it for maybe 2 days and cracked the screen and a week later lost it. He owes my husband a lot of money towards the phone and I doubt we will ever see it. His neighbors have seen him passed out in his truck and checked on him and he wouldn't wake up easily for them and then couldn't stay awake. We know it's drinking and drugs, it breaks my heart because I've dealt with it from both parents since I was little. 

I have been told by his wife and a family friend that my husband should pay his bills, and help him out or he will be homeless. We can not do this financially and even if we could I don't want to.

37,1eah2cw,"AITA for telling my Mom while out casual dining, that it's rude to talk on phone?","I (45f) made reservations at a local restaurant,  nothing fancy but very popular, Fri 5pm. It was my daughter's 14 birthday. She only wanted 6 people, 2 were her grandparents (71f) (69m).

As we walk in, my cell rings. There were likely 8-12 tables seated. I apologize and shut off my ringer. We aren't even seated and my Mom's phone starts to ring. It's the same person who called me (bro43). 
Bro asks what time is cake? 
Mom asks me. 
I say ""7:30 and that I had sent him a message"". His response was ""he didn't get the message"". ""He did, he responded"" I say. 
Mom continues on the call in the restaurant and I quietly tell her that it's rude to be on a call in a restaurant. 
My Mom gets louder and says into the phone and for everyone to hear ""I guess I better go, apparently I'm rude for talking on the phone"".
I focus on the menu. 
In walks another of the birthday girl's guests, her Dad. He sits down and the waitress takes our drink order. His phone rings. It's the birthday girl's sister (who lives in another province with children of her own). He answers phone and puts it on speaker so sister's family can wish her happy b'day. 
My Mom says ""huh, and I get in trouble for answering my phone"". Says she will bite her tongue..
At this point I say nothing and continue to focus on the menu.
The birthday girl had her other sister (15) beside her in the restaurant. The 15yo says ""birthday girl does not want to be sung to"" so that her Dad at the other end of the table for 6 could hear her. 
The Grandma pipes up that she thinks the little kids (on the phone-3m and 2f) would probably like to sing to their Auntie. 
Again, 15yo sister says that the bday girl does not want to be sung to as bday girl confirms this.
My Mom now focuses on me and says ""lighten up, stop taking life so seriously. Smile""
At this point I feel damned no matter what I say/do. 
""My role as a parent is to advocate for my kids when don't think they can do that for themselves (like with Grandma, they don't want to hurt her feelings but they want her to hear what they say and accept it). I reminded Mom we have pie at home and are saving the singing until then because that is what 14yo wanted for her birthday"".

My children's father and I are not together. We have been separated for many years and finally divorced in 2022. We are amicable and kind to one another, co-parenting.. He is not my responsibility. If he is being inconsiderate when he is out with our kids I feel like it is their choice to address it or not. If the kids tell me they need help with a situation I will help them, but I try not to interfere. He asks the grandkids on the phone if they want to sing to Auntie and of course they do. So while still on speaker the kids sing. It's sweet. The LO are happy, but my 14yo b'day girl is a bit upset. The call is ended and my Mom says to me ""why would you put me down in front of my grandkids like that"" and I tell her ""I didn't. That I am just trying to enjoy my daughter's birthday dinner"".

40,1eagki8,WIBTA if I didn’t let my sister bring her ex to my wedding,"I am getting married in the fall. My sister and I have gone through our rough patches over the years and are finally in a better place.

She’s been through a lot in her life dealing with addiction and abusive relationships in the past and has dug herself out of quite the hole over these last several years. I am so proud of the strong woman and mother that she has become. 

Her last serious relationship of several years and two kids “ended” last spring but because of the children involved she’s still living in the same home as her Ex with the kiddos.  She
 has been dating other people since then but it seems that recently her ex is starting to resurface as the “good and changed guy” in her life. The reason they broke things off was because of his drinking leading to verbal and emotional abuse then gaslighting and blame once the booze wore off. I have moved her and the kids out several times at her request and have watched him manipulate her and tell her that she would be nowhere without him and bring her back to the mindset that he can change and will be better this time. 

It breaks my heart to see her broken down like this and my fiancé and I decided the last time he went on a bender and caused her to run out of the house that enough was enough. We don’t like how he treats her or speaks to her, how he behaves when he drinks even in moderation and overall how he brings the mood down.

I don’t want to have to see her upset at my wedding or worrying about her ex staying sober through the night. 

She was okay with this boundary when she was seeing someone else but now that she’s single again she seems to be pushing back against our boundary and wishing that she could bring the ex to the wedding to enjoy the night with. Because of our shaky past I worry that she won’t come to the wedding either if he isn’t welcome. 

I can’t control who she sees but would I be an asshole if I keep my foot down on the ex not being welcome? ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-23,"WIBTA if I didn’t let my sister bring her ex to my wedding I am getting married in the fall. My sister and I have gone through our rough patches over the years and are finally in a better place.

She’s been through a lot in her life dealing with addiction and abusive relationships in the past and has dug herself out of quite the hole over these last several years. I am so proud of the strong woman and mother that she has become. 

Her last serious relationship of several years and two kids “ended” last spring but because of the children involved she’s still living in the same home as her Ex with the kiddos.  She
 has been dating other people since then but it seems that recently her ex is starting to resurface as the “good and changed guy” in her life. The reason they broke things off was because of his drinking leading to verbal and emotional abuse then gaslighting and blame once the booze wore off. I have moved her and the kids out several times at her request and have watched him manipulate her and tell her that she would be nowhere without him and bring her back to the mindset that he can change and will be better this time. 

It breaks my heart to see her broken down like this and my fiancé and I decided the last time he went on a bender and caused her to run out of the house that enough was enough. We don’t like how he treats her or speaks to her, how he behaves when he drinks even in moderation and overall how he brings the mood down.

41,1eagie6,WIBTA for asking my friend about her lies?,"I, (14F), have quite a large friend group that has grown throughout the months. One of my closest friends, A, brought a new girl to the group, L. I saw L in the hallways, and I didn't really think much about her. She was added to the group due to some drama that was going on. She was overall a nice friend and super funny. A and I are Muslim, and we were shocked but delighted when we saw L walk into school with a hijab on. We never knew she was Muslim. I asked her if she converted or been Muslim all her life. **She says she was Muslim all her life, on two occasions.** I was like, 'cool', and moved on with my life.

Later in the school year (can't remember when), she tells us about her life, and how her parents aren't Muslim, and only her sister is. This confused me, because normally if you're born Muslim you have parents who are Muslim as well. I asked her that and she said **she converted a year ago.** I talked to A about this, and we both decided it was weird, but maybe she was shy about telling us about being a convert. Maybe she was worried we'd treat her differently if she was a convert (we definitely wouldn't have). We brushed it off and continued with our lives.

A lot of things happened, and if I wrote it in this post, it would be way too much. I can provide context if needed, but here's a list of weird things I've noticed.

* She said she was Muslim all of her life, then switched up and said she converted a year ago.
* She took off her hijab, saying to A and I that her mom made her, but then telling a mutual friend that it was so that she could remember her sister.
* She didn't celebrate Eid (It was on a school day), and said that she couldn't and that she did the prayer with her sister. However, most Eid prayers are held from 8 am to 10 am, and by that time, she would have been at school. There is the possibility that she prayed quickly before going to school, and also that some people can't miss school for Eid. So this one's not that big of a deal.
* She doesn't understand the day of Judgment and says that God would come down to us when it was the other way around.

-She doesn't know how to pray. We were praying together and she was messing up all the moves.

-She told us that she and her sister only pray once a year,

* When I asked her about her switch-up, she said she was not raised by her parents and has been in an Islamic school in Saudi Arabia for most of her life. But she has shown me pics of when she was young, which couldn't have been taken in Saudi.
* Despite being in this 'Islamic residential school' her whole life, she has not memorized the Quran, which is the whole purpose of these schools.

-If she was in that type of school her whole life, then why did she say she was a convert? I think that if you were in a Muslim school your whole life, then you would at least be Muslim too, right?

42,1eaghnv,AITA for not wanting to go on holiday with my parents?,"So basically like every summer, we're going on a holiday. This year we're going to Spain and France for 7 days each. We've been going to the same location in Spain for like the last 7 years. And since last year we're also going to France (normally it was always only Spain for 10 days or so and that was it).

I'm 19 M and as a kid I used to love going on holiday with my parents but the last couple of years it just became boring, and especially Spain since we've been going to the same location for like 7 years or so and the only ""fun"" thing to do there is the beach, no pool, just an overpopulated beach. I also used to go there with my cousins, but this year they're not there so I'm all alone with another kid 5 years younger than me.

And then there's France, atleast we do got a pool there. But again, that's the only thing, I maybe play in that pool for like 1-2 hours with that other kid and thats it. For the rest of the day I'm just sitting there.

And I also just want to really fully relax and chill and for me that means just having some time alone and having no'one expecting anything from me. And I can't really do that at some small ass apartment (Spain) or an apartment that we gotta share with my parents' friends and that kid (France).

So that's why I proposed to my parents that I should just stay at home, and I gave them my arguments. They firstly said it I had to come, because arrangements and stuff we're already made and if I didn't want to come I should've said sooned (we're leaving in 5 days). Okay whatever, I guess I'll go then. But my dad also called me boring for not wanting to come and said: ""Why wouldn't you wanna come?

43,1eagg49,AITA for yelling at my sister,"For context my 14 year old sister has a habit of not doing a lot of chores around the house and letting others do her work and just spentlding most time in her room instead. I understand that probably is because she is in the midst of puberty however she also has a tendency to be inconsiderate. Before leaving on a hiking trip she was supposed to clean her room and pack her bag as we planned leaving for family vacation a day after she'd arrive back and she did none of it and worse part this isn't the first time. This time I cleaned her room because my mom was sick and I also felt bad for her as she almost always is left with cleaning up after my little sister.

44,1eag8qx,WIBTA if I stopped contributing because I don't feel appreciated?,"I (18F) am home for the summer from college. My parents (50 M and F) and my two younger siblings (15 F, 13 M) are great people and I love being home with them. Despite me getting home the latest every day, I tend to take on a variety of tasks that should be divided among all of us. These are things such as cooking dinner (which I do every work night), cleaning the living room and kitchen (which are full of messes I did not create) and organizing the family schedule (We have a whiteboard that I color-coded and add to). 

Despite the fact that I tend to do each of these things, on top of my work responsibilities and caring for myself, my dad came up to me about 3 days after I got home from college (already working, mind you) and told me that I wasn’t “contributing enough to the household”. What he was referencing was the 3 boxes in the hallway that were things that I brought home from college. I hadn’t put them away yet. I had literally gotten home 3 days prior and had already started working, cooking, cleaning and attempting to get a second job. 

I kept my cool and simply asked “Who cooked you dinner yesterday and today?” “Who cleaned *your* bathroom?” “Who went out and interviewed for 3 jobs today during my lunch break?” “Who helped you schedule your flight?” When his response was “you” to every question, I simply stopped talking and let him come to the realization that I had only been home for 3 days and had already taken on a significant role in the household. 

It’s my siblings as well. Now, I don't want to toot my own horn, but I am a good cook. My mom taught me well, and I am thankful. On top of recipes I've already memorized or created on my own, I also have a Pinterest board of easy, nutritious meals for my family. So nearly every night, I get home from work and cook for my family. Nearly every night, though, my sister turns her nose and says my food is gross and my brother just picks at it until my mom caves and lets him eat cereal. (Which, as a lot of oldest siblings would know, you could never have gotten away with at their age)

What frustrates me is that the food I make is not ""weird"". It is very common food that you would see like Chicken Alfredo, Steak and Potatoes, and beef and rice bowls. My parents normally say thank you and they always clean their plates, but they don't seem to care that my siblings trash-talk my food and my cooking and never say thank you. Most often, it is the opposite of a thank you and they refuse to eat it. 

WIBTA if I just…stopped? I don't expect a thank you for everything I do, but it's frustrating. I only have a month left until I go back to college but it is so incredibly frustrating to come home from working all day to try to do things for my family.

45,1eag8jo,AITA Epilepsy related argument between my brother,"My (22 F) brother (19M with alleged autism, unconfirmed) is being a jerk and our mom seems to be siding with him despite saying she’s not getting involved!?

As the title implies I woke up this morning with a message from my brother basically ranting about how I’m a lazy fuck who uses people. I’ve had Epilepsy since fall of 2017 (Generalized Genetic Tonic Clonic/Grand Mal Epilepsy) not long after I became 15 so I never had the opportunity to try and get my permit/license or a job, I’m not entirely helpless because I help out around the house.

 I then tried arguing my point about how he doesn’t understand the obstacles that people with epilepsy face regardless of how frequently they have seizures or the type of seizure they have (my last one was at the end of April this year) and he just blasted our private conversation from Facebook Messenger onto his Snapchat story with this text attached “Family sucks they get into a conversation they have no business being in. Then being an ableist while also trying to call me one is insane. Saying people won’t hire because of epilepsy is like saying they won’t hire because of diabetes if their blood sugar gets low and they need to take a break. Not how that works and know what you’re talking about before you talk shit, ffs this is annoying”.

Yes I agree I shouldn’t have agreed with his friends comment on their fb post that he was using his autism (our mother has confirmed he’s not officially diagnosed) as an excuse to get away with saying certain things. As stated above he tried comparing Epilepsy to DIABETES. They are 2 entirely different disorders and I’ve tried explaining on multiple occasions WHY I can’t drive and why I’ve debated on not driving at all.

 I brought it up to our mom and even though initially she said she was not picking sides every message she has sent me basically says “I kinda agree with your brother you could be doing more”. What makes this more messed up is our mom works in the medical field so she could better explain my condition to him but won’t. I feel like he also gets treated slightly better just bc he has a license, a car (willed from our uncle who I never met) an apartment, a main job and a side job on the weekend (so pretty much has more adulting experience than me in every aspect). 

I understand kinda like how epilepsy is, Autism has different types and varying degrees and affects everyone with it differently, even in family genetic cases. I updated my mom on the post situation and my brother deflected saying I posted first but my post was to select friends only and all it said was “family is really stressing me out right now” without naming who or what the situation is and she’s saying it’s all my fault even though his post was on his public story where everyone including strangers could see it.

46,1eag6y3,AITA for telling my best friend our friendship ended because of her? ,"I (17) female have a very close friend we will call Maddie. Maddie was a sister to me and someone who always understood me. She was even close with my family. 

This whole situation began when she invited our whole friendgroup to her house. When I got there I noticed that she kept making passive aggressive comments and had been for a few weeks. I ignored it mostly but snapped back a few times. I didn't think much of it because Maddie is a someone who gets irritated easily and when we argue we always talk it out. 

I was also extremely exhausted that day and so slept in her room while the rest of them went to the kitchen. Maddie seemed upset by this as well. (She does the same thing at my house) After napping I joined them only for Maddie to continue to be passively aggressive. I left the room after she made a comment, not wanting to argue and sat in her room for a while. I have always hated conflict due to my home life being filled with it. Maddie then pulled me aside telling me that I had been rude to her all evening and that isolating myself while the rest of the group interacted was not okay. I tried to explain but she wouldnt listen. I left soon after and later that night she sent the first of many horrible messages. 

In these messages she told me how rude I was, how wrong I was for isolating myself and how the whole group deserved an apology. All of her messages had vulgur language, swearing. I did not respond to a single one because I was shocked and sad. Her last message to me was that our friendship was dead to her and that it was because of me. These messages rocked me to my core, this was one of my closest friends saying the meanest things to me. Even though I didn't respond she kept sending me messages over a two week period. 

I went back to school only to find that she had convinced my whole friendgroup besides my one friend that I was the bad guy in this situation. They all told me I owed her an apology.  This resulted in my sobbing because none of them would speak to me properly. I did end up apologising just because I wanted the conflict to end. Even though some people thought I shouldnt apologise I did, however, I made sure to tell her that SHE was the one who ended our friendship the moment she sent me that first horrible message NOT me. I cannot be friends with someone who thinks it's okay to send vulgur messages and then not think they are in the wrong. She also never once asked to speak about the issue. While I admit that maybe I was wrong for sitting in her room I dont think my actions deserved such a horrible response. It almost felt like she was waiting for something to be mad at. She didn't seem to care she was hurting me or throwing away a ten year friendship. 

Im interested to hear what everyone thinks on whether I'm the asshole for saying our friendship ended because of her messages.

Maddie then pulled me aside telling me that I had been rude to her all evening and that isolating myself while the rest of the group interacted was not okay. I tried to explain but she wouldnt listen. I left soon after and later that night she sent the first of many horrible messages. 

In these messages she told me how rude I was, how wrong I was for isolating myself and how the whole group deserved an apology. All of her messages had vulgur language, swearing. I did not respond to a single one because I was shocked and sad. Her last message to me was that our friendship was dead to her and that it was because of me. These messages rocked me to my core, this was one of my closest friends saying the meanest things to me. Even though I didn't respond she kept sending me messages over a two week period. 

I went back to school only to find that she had convinced my whole friendgroup besides my one friend that I was the bad guy in this situation. They all told me I owed her an apology.  This resulted in my sobbing because none of them would speak to me properly. I did end up apologising just because I wanted the conflict to end. Even though some people thought I shouldnt apologise I did, however, I made sure to tell her that SHE was the one who ended our friendship the moment she sent me that first horrible message NOT me. I cannot be friends with someone who thinks it's okay to send vulgur messages and then not think they are in the wrong. She also never once asked to speak about the issue. While I admit that maybe I was wrong for sitting in her room I dont think my actions deserved such a horrible response. It almost felt like she was waiting for something to be mad at. She didn't seem to care she was hurting me or throwing away a ten year friendship. 

Im interested to hear what everyone thinks on whether I'm the asshole for saying our friendship ended because of her messages. ",0.0,0.005028840154409409,0,1
47,1eag4db,AITA for making my mom change her design for our new house?,"A few weeks ago, my mom hired a house designer (idk what they’re called) and she’s been giving him reference pictures for him to work with, none of which I really liked, but if there was something I really didn’t like, then she would remove it, so it wasn’t much of a problem. She likes contemporary art and artistic things while I like my room to be plain and white so I can freely decorate after and change decorations however I want. I understood that she’s always wanted a house like that, so I just let her choose whatever she wanted as long as she let me decide my own room. Which she doesn’t. I also have to share my room with my sister and she doesn’t like a fully white room so there’s some other things in our room that I don’t like, but every single time I say I want something white, my mom shuts me down and says that I don’t understand and am not keeping up with the trends. (Because it doesn’t interest me?) She thinks it’s boring and “too safe”. I think I should’ve explained exactly why I wanted it white, but I don’t think it would’ve been different even if I did. I was convinced she wouldn’t make it the way I wanted it no matter what. I feel like I should add that I hate colorful modern houses with abstract art and prefer a traditional creamy white-centered house with some wood furniture, very much like the house we have now. After a long time, the designer finally sent his final design and the entire house looked like a circus in my opinion. My room especially, looked like what aliens would live in.

48,1eafpju,AITA for telling a couple that I'm not their charity case?,"I've been raising my 8yo nephew ""Jack"" after both his parents died in 2019. I went from being a 34 year old bachelor to being a single dad overnight. I don't regret it or anything but it has and does require a lot of sacrifice.

My brother made good money and invested into a house before died. It's being rented at a loss because the rent is less than the mortgage and other costs but it will be worth a fortune when it is paid off. So I'm basically paying for an 8yo and a house I don't even live in. I also have Jack in a private school. 

This summer Jack wanted to go to a sleepaway camp. It's for six weeks and I could only afford two even though it's a three week minimum. He left last week. Out of the blue, the camp called me up and said someone wanted to sponsor Jack for the whole summer. I was confused.

They said a pair of ""angels"" heard of my hardship and wanted to help out. I said I wouldn't even consider unless they told me who was paying for it. Eventually they said it was the parents of a boy who is an acquaintance of my son. They act like they're better than everyone and come from old money. I've heard them say nasty things about the people that they've helped.

I reached out to them and said my finances are none of their business and I'm not their charity case. I'm not here to make feel better about themselves. They were taken aback by my response and asked me to think of Jack. I said your attitude proves my point.

For the record, Jack has a fun summer planned out which includes many playdates and trips with his cousins and his other uncle is taking him to Legoland in a couple weeks. He's not working in the mines this summer.

Edit: The house was half paid off when I took possession if it. It costs me $400 a month to keep it. I would have lost like 80k before the mortgage is paid off. But the house can easily sell for a million. 

Why would I sell a house at loss when I can keep it at a loss but then sell it at a gain in 15 years?

Edit: You damn right that the house is mine. 

Why shouldn't I be compensated for raising my nephew? So he should get his 250K AND a house whereas I find myself in debt at 53? He's already starting off at an advantage and if I should die then he'd get the house or whatever I have from selling it. 

It's a small compensation to have saved him from going to foster care. I'm sure my brother and my nephew would want me to have the house for putting my entire life and future on hold to raise him.

49,1eafci3,AITA for implying my friend can be easily scammed?,"My friend Jill and her husband told me about an incident that took place yesterday. We live in country 'X' and she got a call from an unknown number, with a different country code 'Y'. The person on the phone told her that they were calling from her local bank, and that they had been notified a fraudster was trying to make a transaction using Jill's card. 

The person then read out the first 5-6 digits of her card to Jill. They then said that they will issue her a new password for her online banking service (or some crazy shit like that) and they just needed her to confirm the remaining few digits of her card number. Jill did get a little suspicious at this point, and asked them why they needed the remaining digits if they already had the first few, and the person on the phone got defensive. But keep in mind that she believed them all this while, up to this point, and thought that this was genuinely the bank calling to notify her of fraud.

I then asked her why she didn't notice all the obvious signs of fraud. The foreign country code, the person not telling her their name/which department they are calling from etc., or why her bank chose to call her rather than email/SMS her with an OTP or something like that.

Here's why I might be the asshole, I got angry and just exploded on them.

55,1eae8uk,AITA for trying to give our new cat two names?,"Hello,

Me(24) and my partner(24) are about to get a kitten. We cannot agree on a name however. 

For context we both love cats but I did not want one while she did. The reason for me not wanting one is due to my allergies.

My allergies are not severe but I can get incredibly itchy, bumpy, and on occasion I wake up struggling to breath when I lived with my parents cats. I would say it happened a handful of times a year where I woke up feeling like I’m breathing through a straw, only one time of which was so bad I went to the ER though it resolved itself while waiting hours for a doctor.

My partner absolutely adores cats however so it was bound to happen and I accepted it. 

The problem comes down to the name. We both have very different and conflicting styles of names for the new cat. Just for context I will say both our names are not offensive, just very different in style though I will not list them to keep this as non biased as possible. 

I recommended that we both just name him something separately. I call him (X), they call him (Y). They completely shut that idea down. Their main argument is that they do not like my names, I did not want a cat in the first place, the cat is mainly theirs, and that it is weird and confusing for the cat and others to have this two name system. 

My main arguments are that, while I didn’t originally want a cat, I still love them and want him to be mine as well, I’m allergic and I think is splitting the name is a fair compromise. 

It seems unfair to me that I would have to deal with the uncomfortable allergies, buying medication, splitting the cost of the cat completely, and not get a say at all in the name especially since I offered a fair if not orthodox solution. 

I was called egotistical for wanting to call the cat something that would annoy them, but these are just genuine names I love for a cat and in my opinion it is egotistical of them to think they should only get to choose the name as it would be a name I don’t like. It’s almost as if they don’t see how it is a one sided situation.

Furthermore I feel like there is something to be said about how they told me “I will get over my allergies after a while of living with the cat”.
I used the rebuttal of “you would get over a name you don’t like after a while of hearing it”.

Perhaps a bit cold but I offered two options. They pay for the cat, and everything the cat needs forever and get to name him **or** I split everything and we split a name. I was called toxic for this.

It just seems really one sided that I’d have to also deal with a name I don’t like without getting to call him something else, have to deal with allergies, and have to pay for the cat and medication when they in my opinion won’t meet me at a reasonable halfway which in my opinion is just giving the cat two names.

It’s not that serious but am I an asshole for adamantly wanting to give the cat two names or thinking I shouldn’t have to pay for the cat at all otherwise?",Everyone Sucks,2024-07-23,"AITA for trying to give our new cat two names? Hello,

56,1eae15m,AITA for telling my best friend to leave her fiancé ,"Posting on a throwaway so my name isn’t affiliated with this.

My best friend (F 21) and her fiancé (M 25 i think) are recently engaged, its all been a bit confusing as my best friend met this guy who lives in a different state over a video game. They started dating around a week or so after they met(I was already suspicious at this point) but i supported her because she seemed happy. However she went to visit him for a week maybe less than 2 weeks after they initially started dating, she came back after that week and said she was engaged, this obviously didn’t sit right with me, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt for the time. It wasn’t until I met him shortly after that where the entire time he acted cold towards me and always had a hand on her, acting really possessive as if I was going to steal her from him (my best mate and I dated briefly when we were in high school but decided we would be better as friends mutually). Behind my back I found out through her that he was calling me jealous because I supposedly “saw how happy she was and did that like it”

Absolutely not. I was happy for her, being a past tense. 

Now that I knew he was talking shit about me to my best friend, that was it. However, being the supportive person I am, didn’t voice my opinion yet. About a week later I get a call from my best friend, she opens up to me about how behind closed doors he’s a bit manipulative and quite controlling(telling her that she can’t go out drinking but he’s allowed, telling her she can’t have male friends yet all his friends are female etc.)

This really sets me off, i basically tell her over that call that I never liked him, and that she meeds to leave him, she agrees with me but she is a major people pleaser and hates hurting peoples feelings.

Ultimately i haven’t been told that i’m an asshole, i just feel like one, i don’t want to be the reason they split up.

For context sometimes I go over and he's half way through a game or a TV show and I don't mind waiting for him to finish.

So I was waiting for him to finish his game as ussual but then he said he had to check on his brother and I said it's fine only expecting it to take like an hour or something but boy I was wrong. We go over to his brother's house and he straight away goes on his brother's Xbox and starts playing a single game there taking in turns with his brother meanwhile I was sitting in the corner biting my own hand to prevent myself from crying out loud. 

No one interacted with me at all even though I made attempts to be included. We spent the rest of the day at his brother's house up until 11 pm on our way back I was so distraught I couldn't hold back my tears and started crying I told him I wasn't happy with how he's neglected me and because we spent the whole day at his brother's house I missed taking my medication that I told him I NEEDED to take multiple times (I've never been to his brother's house and didn't know my way back) anyway on our way back to his house he apologises and then goes ""oh btw my friend is going through a hard time and wants me to play online with them, is that alright with you?"" At that point my head was spinning and just agreed I mean he spent the whole day playing video games and ignoring me so what does it matter if he spends the rest of the night gaming and ignoring me too. I just went to bed with out him. 

When we woke up he cuddled me then said ""oh is it ok if we stay over at my brother's house for tonight?""

61,1eadq04,AITA for going against family values?,"Last November, my sister (34F) found out that I (23F) had stayed overnight at my partner's place through my phone location. She holds more traditional values, but I don't necessarily agree to all of them.

To give some backstory, she doesn't like the partner that I was with, and we've had multiple fights over it. I broke up with them once before, but we got back together and I hid it from my family, hoping that maybe eventually they would come around on him. So, staying over at person's place was incredibly scandalous to her. She's very much the, ""save yourself for marriage"" type, even though she previously has said that it was okay for me to hook up with people.

When she found out, she basically called me a slut in front of my 2-year-old niece during a video call, who could very much understand words and tones. She told her that she ""shouldn't follow in your aunt's footsteps"" and that the ""devil was inside her (me)"". We got into a heated fight on Thanksgiving. I told her that I don't appreciate her stalking me through my location, and that she's never considered whether or not I was actually happy with the person I was with. She kept telling me that I was immature, and that ""just because candy is good it doesn't mean you can have it forever,"" along with other very hurtful comments. We ended on a terrible note.

Recently my sister lost her job and had to move back in with my parents and she had her car repossessed while I was over. She parked it on the street and my dad and I went out to ask and the tow tucked driver said it was for non payment. 

My sister was crying and embarrassing and swore us not to tell anybody in the family about it. I asked my sister “why, you don’t people talking about you how you talk about everyone else?” 

My sister turned on me saying how could I say that to her when the worst thing ever just happened to her? I told my sister that she never once stop to consider maybe other people are having the worst time ever and how my sister would gladly share that information about cheating, drug use, divorce, and job loss with anyone who would listen and now it’s my sister’s turn.

Anyways, her accent is decently strong, and I can understand her, and sometimes people need her to repeat herself. I grew up in America, but I'm African, so yeah not too big of a deal for me.

So, on Sunday night, we went out for dinner, and the waiter asked her to say her order again, because he didn't understand what she said, and she said it again in a different accent. The waiter went from ""Repeat that"" face to ""What the fuck did you just say?"" and I was let out a laugh. Because I had no idea what she said either. I just told the waiter her order and that was it. 

On the way home, she said I embarrassed her, but I think it was just some harmless fun. I did apologize, but she seemed not too satisfied with that.

64,1eadkrv,WIBTA if I refuse to buy a tacky painting my SIL made for my family?,"My daughter and I love reading these together... now it’s my turn to ask for judgement!  
  
I’m 52F and this situation concerns my husband’s brother “Drew” (59M) and his wife of 5 years “Susanne” (35F). Drew supports Susanne on his income while she focuses on her dream of being an artist. She makes paintings of people and animals, and has a website where she advertises her work for sale.  
  
Privately, I don’t think her art is very good. It’s absolutely better than what I could do, but it doesn’t look “professional,” if you know what I mean. My husband feels the same, so we have not opted to purchase any of her art, despite her dropping hints here and there about it.  
  
The art on her site is priced in the $3-5K range. I realize that labor and cost of materials must be taken into account, but given the quality, those prices seem outrageous to me. I suspect she’s not making regular sales, because she started making portraits of friends, family, or pets “as a surprise,” and usually, said family and friends end up feeling obligated to buy the painting as a courtesy. Unfortunately, my husband and I were the latest victims of this sales tactic.  
  
My son recently proposed to his girlfriend, and we took the two of them, his girlfriend's parents, and our daughter out to a fancy dinner to celebrate. Both my kids posted pictures from dinner on social media. Without telling anyone, Susanne decided to make a painting of one of these pictures, of everyone smiling for the camera. She revealed the big “surprise” at a party she and Drew hosted two weeks ago. The painting is a whopping 40x58”, and I honestly think it’s awful... kitsch and tacky.  
  
I told Susanne it was sweet of her to commemorate such a special moment in our family, but I carefully avoided saying anything about “liking” it. As I feared, she kept dropping hints throughout the party about how we can buy it as a wedding gift, and she would be happy to give us a big discount off what she would charge someone else. (Who else would buy it?) I politely dodged these hints, and she was clearly disappointed.  
  
Over the weekend, Drew reached out to my husband to say that Susanne feels hurt that we never made an offer. He said it’s becoming obvious as the years go by that we’ve never purchased one of her pieces, even though we have the means to do so, and it would mean a lot to them if we buy the painting. Her original asking price was $2.5K, and Drew said he’ll reduce it further to $1900.  
  
It's not about the money (not entirely.) It’s the principle of the thing. I feel like I’m being strongarmed into paying for something I never asked for, don’t like, and don’t have space for in my house. I asked, and my son and his fiancée don’t want it. My husband thinks we should just buy it to keep the peace in the family and avoid a potential rift with Susanne and Drew. He also says the way I talk makes me sound like a snob (even though I would never share these opinions with anyone I know but him.) WIBTA if I stand my ground and refuse?

65,1eadjmb,AITA for not going above and beyond to visit my mother and siblings after 4+ years?,"been a while since I’ve used this account, and I’m on mobile, so please forgive any grammar issues. 

I (26f) haven’t had a solid relationship with my mother since I was 12. That year, she gave full custody to my dad so she and my then newborn half sibling could move abroad to be with my ex-stepdad, who was stationed there with the military. They moved back to the states 3 years later and were stationed 3 1/2 hours from where I lived, where she remained after divorcing my stepdad 2 years later. She had my youngest sister a few years after that, when I was 18.

Since I got married in 2020, life has been hectic. Our rental was sold and we were forced out so the owner’s son could move in. We bought a near tear down house and put all of our savings into making it liveable. I was laid off from my job and had to scramble to switch my career path into a role that is a lot more demanding. Last year I was in a serious car accident. At the moment, we only have my husband’s car to use. 

A little over a week ago, my youngest sister (8) became ill, and the pediatrician sent her and my mother to the hospital. For some reason, it took them a while to figure out it was pneumonia. I FaceTimed with them and talked to my mother to get as many updates as possible, but was assured of her health.

My mother texted me on their 2nd day there, asking if I could make the 3 1/2 hour drive to sit with my other sibling (15nb) as they were “all alone all day”. Because of my car situation and my work, I couldn’t do the drive, but texted and FaceTimed my sibling to keep them company, who was happy to be home alone. My youngest sister got better and was able to go home 2 days later. 

Last night, my texts started blowing up from my mother. It was a complete 180 to how we had been talking to each other before. Novels of texts accused me of not caring about any of them. According to her, I should’ve rented a car and gone anyway, slept on her couch and be there for them. She said my unresolved issues with her kept me from caring about my baby sister and my sibling. And that she has coworkers my age who try harder than I do. 

My husband thinks we should go no-contact for this outburst, as we’ve tried many other avenues to help her. They’ve been welcomed in our home more than once and have stayed for a few days at a time. This also isn’t the first major fight we’ve had in the last couple of years where she gets nasty and hurtful when I don’t do exactly what she wants.

I called my dad, and to my surprise, he agrees with her that I should’ve sucked it up and done what I could to make the trip there anyway, and while she’s saying hurtful things, it all comes from love and missing me. It’s left me very confused and conflicted on if I fucked up as a daughter and a sister.

66,1eadhxd,AITA for “taking it too far” when I texted my sister about my snatched lunch?,"
For lack of a better title this is what I came up with. 

BG: My sister (20F) and I (23M) both live it at home. We both work full time and this issue is pretty simple. More a petty sibling drama perhaps but im still seething so I thought I would ask cause I feel bad. Another factor that I do think needs to be taken into account is I am currently quitting nicotine and am in the thick of it. Day 3 so quite moody and feeling like crap. 

What Happened: over the course of this summer in particular my sister has snatched multiple (maybe 3-4 since may/june) lunches that I have made for myself to take to work. To be honest its not the end of the world but I plan my mornings around having that to take. I leave and on my way out grab said lunch. When its not there I have to either make a new one which makes me late for work or spend money on a lunch I otherwise would not be spending money on. 

The other times I have just said a “hey thats shitty could you please not take my lunch” and moved on but this morning I had enough. Yesterday and for a lot of family dinners she is not home. Meaning no lunch was made for her and any leftovers were just put into one big container. Any work lunches are put in seperate containers off to the side (This morning it was just my moms and I’s). There was even extra for her to make her own too but she still took the one I MADE. So I sent a text saying that next time she will be sending me money. She also has been talking a lot recently about moving out and so this is where I may have went to far but I basically told her that any roommate would currently not enjoy being her roommate and she has a lot of growing to do before she should consider that. She called me rude and says I always take things 10x too far. For me its not even the food its the principle at this point. 

So should I say sorry, or stand on my business

68,1ead5g8,AITA for being an unreliable babysitter?,"I watch my sister's kids (both toddler age) once a week and she pays me for it. This started with one kid 5 years ago and then both 2 years ago. I'm child free and I love kids and I love my sister's kids so much but watching them even one day is overwhelming for me. They do basic toddler stuff (get into fights, get frustrated over small stuff, scream when something doesn't go their way, etc) and I do my best to just deal with it because, again, toddlers.

The problem is mainly where it started. It went from occasionally being asked, to having to do it 2 days a week (meaning my only days off were spent watching the kids from morning to evening). At the time I worked at an understaffed grocery store chain (fun place to work during the pandemic I tell you what) where even if I only worked 4 hours it took a lot out of me because of how demanding that job was. So basically I had to deal with people, both big and small, yelling at me when something didn't go there way which took a toll on my mental health. And if I ""call in"" to say I can't babysit, all hell breaks loose because it means the kids either have to go to work with my sister or my sister has to stay home. Which lead to me occasionally calling in to work which messed with my mental health even more because I knew I was letting my coworkers down too. 

At one point my sister and I got into a huge argument (not sharing why here) so I stopped watching her kids for a while. Eventually I found myself a job that was better for me in every way and a while after that I started watching her kids again (this time only once a week so that I could have the other day off for me for a change). But then recently I was hanging out with some people my sister and I knew and I mentioned I wasn't sure if I was gonna be able to babysit that week because I was getting over a cold (at the time I was still having a hard time doing anything without having a hard time breathing or feeling dizzy) and one of them said ""you HAVE to, there's no babysitters left"" Ill admit that out the pressure back on me a little bit but I brushed it off. Later we were talking about kids and I made a comment about how I watch them once a week instead of more because I couldnt handle it and the friend said (all serious) about how she watches my sisters kids and her own for three days a week now that I'm only watching them once a week. And now I'm feeling guilty because, yes, I said I'd watch the kids and have made a point to set aside certain days to watch them, but I hate the fact that I feel like I have no choice in the matter. And growing up I always felt like if I said no I'd be an AH. Like if one day I were to say ""hey, starting next month I want to take a break from babysitting"" is that going to start another big fight between me and my sister? And the rest of the family?

I feel like my ex-BILs kids were resentful of the marriage and I also picked up on some resentments for their dad, and I feel like this was largely ignored. It always surprised me just how much my nephew and niece adored two kids who went out of their way to make it clear they were not siblings. But I also didn't live there so could never be sure if there were some ""good"" moments between them.

The divorce has been so hard on my nephew and niece. They miss their stepdad, but mostly their stepsiblings, despite the one-sided relationship. My ex-BIL has apparently tried to convince his kids to maintain some contact with my nephew and niece but they're just too glad the marriage ended and they don't have to be ""a stupid fake family"" anymore.

My sister has been very negative about her stepkids to my nephew and niece since the divorce proceedings started. Starting when her ex said his kids would not be kind if they tried to have them see each other anyway. My sister said they were shitty fucking brats to care so little. She has tried to encourage her kids to hate their (former) stepsiblings. She will say they never wanted them, how awful it is to be a family for years and not give a shit, how selfish the kids are.

The kids are heartbroken and she makes it worse. They have cried on my shoulder. They have expressed their sadness. They're also very confused about everything.

My sister also vents on my shoulder, since she doesn't cry. She has said she cannot believe they were a family for so long and her ex's kids care so little that even one kind phone call is too much to expect from them for her kids. She's also bitter that her marriage ended. I have soothed her as much as possible. But I also brought up the topic of the kids and how hard this is on them and how they might need extra support of some kind. She told me it'd be fine. I suggested it might help if she doesn't discuss her hard feelings toward her ex's kids. She dismissed it.

I then witnessed her saying more of the same and her daughter left the room in tears. This is when I told my sister to step up and be a better mom and help her kids instead of adding to their heartache. I told her she can't keep doing what she is. She told me I will never get it and I'm not supporting anyone with that attitude.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-23,"AITA for telling my sister to step up and be a better mom? My sister is going through a divorce, so it's hard, and I understand that she's got a lot on her plate. But I (25f) am really worried about my nephew (8) and my niece (7) and I think my sister's behavior is adding to that worry for me.

My roommate owns an older gas car and doesn't benefit from the free EV charging company perk, so he pays for his own gas.

We drop each other off to the airport a roughly equivalent amount, but at the end of our lease, my roommate sends me a bill for all the gas involved in airport dropoffs over the last year ($85).

I had taken wfh but still took her to a few places and all she was screaming about is i want to eat this food i want to eat that food you both dont pamper me etc. i was so annoyed. anyways she left. 

after that, i didnt talk to her or text her and she was pissed at me for not calling her. i told my bf why doesnt she call me instead what is this ego game? and then he said she is elder to us thats why. i let it pass. now today, all of a sudden, she asked my bf where is your gf? how is she so many days no text. my bf told her that i am sick and caught a cold since a week. she said oh ok. i asked my bf if his mom is so concerened why didnt she text me instead?why didnt she call or text me about not being in touch for so long? if i didnt call, she could have called right? my bf defended her by saying she is elder to us and expects me to call her. she doesnt mean any harm. 

my only concern is that if my bf is being so tolerant to his mothers bitchy behaviour, right now, and also expects me to take part in the ego olympics, then what will become of me after we get married? we both are 24. been dating for 1.5 years. i am an indian and i think they expect me to be the typical housewife who calls her elders and pampers them. i really fear my independence being curbed by this all.

I didn’t know what happened to my mom and after a few years my dad told us about her addiction and what happened to her, that she was not able to see us at that time. My mom was my idol so it really broke my heart. 
With my mom out of the picture, a narrative began to grow in our house. My stepmom was to be viewed as my mom. I regected this my entire childhood and teenage years as she did not treat me well and was cruel to me most of the time… and my mom was still out there somwhere. There were small moments when she would try to do something kind but she would always hold it over my head in the end, as a reason I should consider her my mom. She and I fought often and very aggressively. She even hit me a few times. But she never treated me like a mother would, which I longed for my whole childhood. 
I never got the chance to accept or understand what happened to my mom. My dad would not let us see her and replaced her so quickly. 
When I became an adult I was able to talk to my mom more. In the time that was not able to see her, she had been going through a living hell.

I feel like I have to let my step mom have the role, but I literally want to cry.

73,1eabugy,AITA for telling my roommate that her boyfriend should not be living with us if he won't contribute?,"I (22F) share an apartment with my best friend Anna (23F). We met in high school and recently rented an apartment together. For the most part, things have been smooth. However, recently, an issue has been causing tension.

Anna has been dating her boyfriend Tom (24M) for about six months. Over the past month, Tom has started to stay over almost every night. While I don't mind him visiting, it feels like he is practically living with us without contributing to the rent or the utilities.

I talked to Anna about how uncomfortable I felt with Tom being around all the time and mentioned it was affecting my privacy and personal space. I usually don't wear a bra around the apartment as it is usually just me and my roommate, but I am not comfortable with not wearing one around men, especially given a situation that happened with my sister's husband.

Anna was originally understanding, but she then became defensive of Tom, saying that Tom is having a difficult living situation at home, and she just wants to help him out. She assured me that it was only temporary, and that Tom was going to find a better place.

That was five weeks ago, and nothing has changed. I have not seen even a little effort from him to find a new place, and at this point, I am pissed. He is here rent-free, using up our amenities and taking up space. The longer it lasts, the more frustrated I become. I brought it up with Anna again and said Tom could chip in for the extra expenses if he was going to be in our apartment so often.

Yet again, Anna was defensive and said I was being unreasonable and unsympathetic to Tom's situation. At this point, I am lost on what to do. I don't want to ruin or hurt my friendship with Anna, but I also feel like my boundaries have been ignored.

74,1eabmz2,AITA for calling out my friend's behavior after I noticed he only talks to me when he is single,"For context: 
I (31F) have been friends with Chris (32) since we were kids. We ended up dating in high school, but it didn't work out. After things cooled down a bit, we decided to remain friends and have through the years. There was however a random period of time when we didn't talk after he deleted me with no explanation. He started to message me again after a couple years and admitted his former gf was really insecure and made him delete me. He started talking to me again after he got dumped, I guess.

Present Issue:
It's been maybe 7 years since then and we communicate regularly via social media. I sent him a message like usual on our primary chat and noticed the messages were still unread after a couple days. I didn't take it personally. Two weeks go by and my messages are still unread, which is super abnormal at this point.

I just got a random message from him (on a platform we barely communicate on) saying that he started seeing someone new and didn't want to give her the wrong impression by talking to me regularly. That it was nothing negative/personal towards me, but he was just letting me know that he wouldn't be having much contact. I initially told him I understood. 

I could have left it at that. However after I thought about it some more, I decided to call him out in regards to him only talking to me when he's single. This might be where I am the asshole.

I essentially told him that I'm not really interested in having a friendship of convenience when he is single or one that's restricted to sneaky chats. I said that if he can't even communicate the nature of our friendship/history to the woman he's seeing, then it must not be that important to him . I also brought up how this is similar to what happened with his ex when he randomly cut me off before.

I don't think this was the response he was expecting. He got defensive and claimed that now I'm holding these things over his head. He then started back pedaling saying he's planning to talk to her about it once things are more solid between them and to be patient. He took screenshots of our conversation on Snapchat, so I'm sure they have appeared in some sort of group chat where I am being portrayed like a villain.

Long story short. I am an overachiever in my family whereas my brother fails his classes and doesn't even have any hobby. My father has always wanted a boy and when he had my brother he was ecstatic. (Yeah he's a little misogynistic) 
My father gives gifts to my brother for doing nothing, but that's not the case for me, I have to score well. I have to become a doctor. I have to do things to prove myself. Little flashback to when I was 11, I was scoring somewhere between 80%-90%, that was when my father threatened me to marry me off at 18 because I don't study well. But my brother? He begged him to pass his class. And when he did, he bought him gifts. My father allows my brother to go out even in the midnight while me? Haha I can't meet my friend even when she lives 5 mins away from my home. He thinks that will impact my studies. He doesn't want me to have any friend.  Right now I am studying for medical away from home. 
2 months ago, I went home for a whole month. Everything was well and good we did fight a few times but that's it. It was a normal brother-sister fight. Until the day of my return. My brother fought with me over something as small as charging my phone which led to my parents being biased with me. I didn't want to argue before my flight so I went silent. He broke some stuffs too. (Like his Phone my charger and some of the other stuffs)

All good.
But not for long. When I got off the plane at like 11pm I got a call my mother saying that my brother left the house. Why you ask? Because he didn't like that my parents went to the airport with me. He said that they love me more. He thinks that I am always being favored. (Not his fault I think, my father does pamper me when I get good grades. I had an online test 2 days back) He thinks he is being treated like an adopted child where the parents love the biological one more. He said he is leaving because of me. He said that he didn't want a selfish sister like me.
That's it. That broke me. I've always cared for him from my heart. But he had this hatred for me.
 I knew he will come back so I asked my mother to call me once he does.

76,1eabght,AITA For asking if my brothers will be coming along on a trip? ,"Hello Reddit! I’m a 34-year-old male living with my girlfriend. Recently, we visited my folks who live across the country. We rented a cabin so my family could spend time together. One of my brothers has ADHD and anger issues, which made the visit tense.

We visited for four days, and before leaving, my mom asked if my girlfriend and I could come back next month for a day trip to a nearby country. We said we’d consider it. My girlfriend, who is an introvert, asked if it would just be the four of us (my parents, her, and me) since the previous visit was quite intense.

I called my mom to discuss booking tickets and mentioned my girlfriend found the last visit intense, possibly due to my brother's mood. My mom initially agreed it would just be us four, but then suddenly got upset, saying she wouldn’t exclude my brother, and broke down crying. She cut the call short, saying she needed to walk the dog.

I called back later to clarify, explaining we weren’t trying to exclude anyone but wanted a calmer trip. My mom insisted my girlfriend doesn’t like our family, which isn’t true. I tried to explain again, but she got angrier, accusing my girlfriend of disliking the family. She hung up on me.

I filled my girlfriend in, and she was understandably upset. She pointed out how much effort she’s made to spend time with my family, despite only seeing her own parents for a total of seven days in the last year. She attended several family events, including my moms fathers funeral, britherd 30th birthday party, christmas, , supported my mom after her stroke, and genuinely likes my family.

I wrote a message to my mom to explain: ""GF just felt she still doesn't know the family well and that our family speaks at a noise level she's not used to. She likes the family very much but wanted to know what kind of energy to expect when we visit. We’ll skip the visit now as we wanted to come to make you happy, but the opposite has happened. GF has spent more time with our family than her own. She wouldn’t have done it if she didn’t like the family. Wanting a quiet trip doesn’t mean we don’t want to see my brothers or exclude them. GF didn’t say anything about ADHD Brother; I did. I explained very badly and apologize for that and the angry things I said.""

My mom read it but hasn’t replied. What can I do to salvage the situation? I get the feeling my mom suddenly thinks my GF is a jerk, even though she absolutely isn’t. AITA?

Edit: Some mentioned i didnt give context for what my brother did, he was angry the whole time during the last visit, shouting, at my mum, refusing to help with any of the cleanup, stormed off into another room etc. And its like this almost all the time.

Edit 2: due to the 3K limit, parts of original text had to be edited down/Removed. Someone pointed put i threw my Gf under the buss. I get that.

78,1eab2xp,AITA for getting a coworker in trouble over a name?,"I (17F) grew up attending an overnight camp from the ages of 7-13. A few members of staff stayed year after year and I got to know them pretty well. One of the benefits of being on the staff at this particular camp is that it hires mainly non-Americans. I am one of four Americans on a seventy person staff. The only downside to this is that everyone I work with has a moderate accent, and I chose to use a name that can be hard to pronounce for non-native speakers.

I have a first and middle name. My first name is very common and easier to pronounce but I stopped using it when I was twelve and elected to go by my middle name. My middle name is more difficult to pronounce and many of my coworkers struggle to say it. I told people that they could refer to me by just the first letter, but I have made one exception.

My friend ""Amy""(28F) has worked at the camp for as long as I've been a camper. She was my counselor almost every summer and now that I'm also part of the staff we're really close. Since that first summer she has called me by a nickname that is based off of my first name. She's the only one who has ever been allowed to call me that, and asked at the beginning of the summer if she could continue to use it. I said yes, because I find it endearing.

Now here is where I might be an AH. Another one of my coworkers, ""Ben"" (23M), has overheard Amy use the nickname and has asked if he could use it to. This is Ben's first summer at camp, so I don't know him super well and asked him to please not. Now he won't stop bugging me. He tells me that my name is beautiful, that I shouldn't be 'ashamed' to use it (I'm not ashamed I just don't like it), and that if Amy gets to use it its obviously not a big deal. I told him 'no' over and over again.

Ben was unhappy with this apparently because yesterday I heard campers calling me my first name. I wasn't sure if they were talking to me or not because I've never told them my first name. They were shouting it, and every time I asked them to stop, they would giggle and laugh. Kids do that kind of thing. I brought it up yesterday at team meeting and asked Ben if he had told the kids my name. He said he 'must have let it slip'. He added, ""they won't stop using it so it must be okay for everyone to use it now"". I told him, and every other member of staff in that room that if anyone tries to call me by my first name or encourages campers to call me by my first name I simply wouldn't respond.

The sentiment of the room was that the staff had my back, and I caught many people glaring at Ben during the rest of the meeting. After the meeting I saw our boss pull him into the office, and when he came out he told me that if I really had a problem with it I could have just said 'no' or told him to stop. He said I didn't have to bring it up in front of the entire staff. A few other of my coworkers had the same thoughts. I feel like I tried to say 'no' and 'stop' but wasn't listened to.

So, i got my wife a old beater and gave her some driving lessons along with a driving instructor and she passed!

She was happy with driving the car i got her but i thought i should treat her, (Up till now i drove a 2011 civic as a family neither of us have ever had a new car) So i put together some of my savings and bought her a brand new Mercedes A220 which she loved!

He started asking about the car and asked the price and where my Honda went. When i started telling him what happened to my car he cut me off mid way through and asked if he could test the car. At which point i told him it was my wife's and that i would like to keep it pristine for her.

He gave me a bit off a look and stormed into the office block. As i walked up i got a few weird looks and when i sat down next to my work buddy he said that X told everyone in the office that i am a A--hole and that i have changed into a ""snob"" after getting a new car.

I have been wanting to stretch my ears since I was about 10 or so and have been researching on it for a while. My parents are not into body modifications as they associate piercings and tattoos with degenerate behaviour and find them ugly. As an extension my sisters don’t have a problem with people who have body mods, but think I shouldn’t do it because my parents don’t want me to do it. 

However with stretched ears they said they find that people who have them look like degenerates and I did not want to be judged. I posted on my close friends story on Instagram that I wanted stretched ears some months ago and someone screenshot it and sent it to my sisters who told me I would look weird. I didn’t want them to judge me but I still wanted them. I bought gauges and stretchers to start and they saw them and I quickly told them they were just regular earrings. They dropped it after that but I felt guilty. I took the gauges out and am still waiting to put them back. 

Since ear stretching is supposed to be a slow process, you will still have a lot of time to decide it’s not what you want and take them out before you get to the sizes of no return. That’s my plan if I’m not feeling it, meaning it’s very reversible on its own without surgery.

My roommate argues that those were a one time thing (which he paid) and that it shouldn't be expected of him to pay for all other trips whereas I think it's a basic thing that's expected in any ridesharing situation.

Basically my lovely neighbour John passed away unexpectedly on Friday. It was unexpected, but he was 88. The police were involved but I'm pretty sure it was more of a formality than anything.

He has 3 kids, a son and a daughter in the UK and a son in Australia. He didn't have a great relationship with his kids in the UK (though not a bad one either) but has always said his son in Australia is his favourite.

I don't know if he had a will or not but I highly doubt that even if he had a straightforward one it would've already been sorted; and I haven't had any deaths in my family so I wouldn't know if this is normal behaviour.

1. after one of our flights got cancled and we has a 12 hour overnight layover so we were both tired and irritated. we had two checked bags included and she wanted to check hers in along with our shared suitcase because it is very heavy and uncomfortable. I got uspset and asked if she wanted to trade off my backpack then to make it fair because mine was heavy as well. she got upset ans said then i guess if we bith cant have it none of us can right? and i asked her if iy would be ok if i checked my bag instead and if she thought that was fair. she didnt say anything until we got off our flight at the next destination. so i didnt say anything either as i felt i was always the one to apologize first so i wanted to see if she would make the effort. when we arrived she got upset i was ignoring her and when i explained I was just doing the same thing she did she didnt like it.

3. she got mad at me for using her makeup stuff during our trip which i felt was crazy as she was expecting to come back to my place, use my things and live in my friends room and use my friends bike for free!

They did try to send her to therapy but it put a huge strain on finances. She wouldn’t do the stuff and my parents stopped doing it

I am older than her so she left me alone for the most part. My brother (Ron) was two years younger and she was a huge bully to  him. She made his life a hell in the home.

88,1ea9d7n,WIBTA for selling my car that I know has problems,"So my dad put a post up for my car on facebook marketplace. It’s a 2000 honda crv for AUD $2600.

I originally got the car for AUD $5500 about 6-7 months ago. About a couple weeks after buying it, problems were already happening.

Heres a short list of everything wrong with it:

- gear box is completely gone (according to dad, as of yesterday)
- hazards turn on randomly
- drivers window has trouble going up and down
- drivers door doesn’t open 
- transmission is pretty much fked
- shudders heaps when first driving
- takes a bit to get in gear
- revs hell high even when not moving

Pretty much I’m trying to get rid of it, I was going to put it on FB for dirt cheap and obviously let people know of its condition, but dad said he’d handle it and now some young guy is buying it this Saturday.

I owe my parents a couple thousand because I went halves in a new car that I just got. Since we’re selling this car for this price I won’t owe them as much, and dad is saying it will help with bills etc.

But I just feel really guilty, I’m thinking about saying something to the guy this weekend. I told dad I don’t agree with what he’s doing, but he said to leave it, and “as long as it works when he drives away, then it’s ok”.

I turned to K, and asked him, “So, you think your brother’s future kids are going to wake up one day and come out as gay?” Immediately, K became angry with me. He felt that what I said was rude. Apparently, I also asked K’s girlfriend, C, if “She thought K’s brother’s future kids would be gay”. I don’t remember saying this at all. The next day, I apologized to everyone for my behavior. I talked to C about the situation after it happened. She felt that what I said was rude, and that I needed to apologize to her boyfriend”. I apologized, but he never responded to it. I moved on and never brought it up to C again. Fast forward two weeks. My boyfriend goes over to K’s house. (K invited me over surprisingly, but I politely declined). K and my boyfriend were drinking. K says to my boyfriend that “he’s still angry at me for what I said, and that he isn’t sure he’ll invite me over for a while”. My boyfriend said him and I “are a package deal, and he won’t go to K’s house as long as (I’m) not welcome”. I talked to C about it the next day. She said she’d talk to K about inviting me over when she visits again in August. She also said she’d talk to K about how he treats me overall. K frequently makes comments to me that come across as rude, but he says he’s “just trolling, and (I) know it”. However, he did cross the line when he asked if my male cousin, who has anorexia, is “gay” because it’s a “stereotype” (he said this to me before I made my comment). Later that night, everyone left our group chat. I asked C why everyone left the chat. She said she’s “sick of the drama”. I asked her if I said or did something to upset her. She said “No, I’m just sick of the drama”. I asked her if she thought I was causing drama. She said, “All the drama is between you and K, and what you said to K was rude. You did apologize, which I understand, but K doesn’t have to forgive you. It’s unfair your boyfriend is making K choose between their friendship and allowing you to go back to his house. Your boyfriend has my name in his mouth and I don’t like it. K needs time and he will probably forgive you. I don’t do drama. We still love you though”. I told her I can’t control what my boyfriend chooses to do, and I apologized for being responsible for the drama. I thought this was the end. That night, I hung out with my family. I opened C’s SnapChat, but I didn’t respond. The next day, she asked me if I was “good” because I “left (her) on open for 14 hours” and she “wanted to make sure I was okay”. I snapped her back, and she left me on open. That felt petty. I just need space until everything simmers down.

Later that night, everyone left our group chat. I asked C why everyone left the chat. She said she’s “sick of the drama”. I asked her if I said or did something to upset her. She said “No, I’m just sick of the drama”. I asked her if she thought I was causing drama. She said, “All the drama is between you and K, and what you said to K was rude. You did apologize, which I understand, but K doesn’t have to forgive you. It’s unfair your boyfriend is making K choose between their friendship and allowing you to go back to his house. Your boyfriend has my name in his mouth and I don’t like it. K needs time and he will probably forgive you. I don’t do drama. We still love you though”. I told her I can’t control what my boyfriend chooses to do, and I apologized for being responsible for the drama. I thought this was the end. That night, I hung out with my family. I opened C’s SnapChat, but I didn’t respond. The next day, she asked me if I was “good” because I “left (her) on open for 14 hours” and she “wanted to make sure I was okay”. I snapped her back, and she left me on open. That felt petty. I just need space until everything simmers down. 
Am I the asshole?

93,1ea85gx,AITA for telling the family therapist my dad and stepmom refused to do the homework assigned and didn't follow her advice?,"I'm (16m) in therapy with my dad and stepmom. It's been 3 or 4 months of therapy now. We started going because my stepmom wants a different relationship with me than I want with her, her feelings were getting hurt and I was getting frustrated with feeling like what I wanted didn't matter and that her wants were the priority.

Stepmom has been stepmom since I was 9 and I've known her since I was 9. I didn't really get time in between meeting her and her marrying dad to get to know her well because she moved states to live with us. I lost my mom when I was 5. She wanted us to have a mom/son dynamic. I saw her as family but not as a mom or even an actual parent. I do respect her. I think she's nice. I think she's funny and we'd be friends easier if I had been older. But I don't want another mom. Her giving birth to my half siblings didn't change that for me, but having them made her more eager for more.

She calls me her son all the time. I have voiced before that I wish she'd say stepson. I was ignored and it was never addressed.

When we started therapy I had mentioned that was something I disliked. She had talked about how she disliked me calling her by her name. How she wanted something more formal between us, like ""momma"" or something. Dad said he wanted me to embrace having a second mom. He wanted me to let my stepmom be my second mom. 

I was honest that I feel like my voice doesn't matter when they ignore me asking her to call me her stepson. I explained why I want that, why I feel as I do. They tried to dismiss it but the therapist told them to stop. She told them that me feeling like it lessens my mom is valid. That many kids and adults feel that way. And while that could change if I wanted it to, if I wanted to work on that, if not it was something they would need to accept.

Two weeks ago she gave us ""homework"" she wanted us to sit down and discuss outside of therapy the whole ""son/momma"" thing and come back to her with notes from it. She also wanted my stepmom to call me her stepson for a week. They didn't do any of that. I told the therapist during our session last week. I said they refused to sit with me (true) and she never once called me her stepson. I was asked to sit out for the rest of the session and she had it just them and her that day.

They are so pissed at me. They told me I had done that to spite them and it's not fair that my stepmom has to do the work but not me, and she's right while I'm wrong.

94,1ea7sae,AITA for using the living till past midnight ,"
My problem has been that over the past four months, my roommate has let his friend sleep in our living room and live with us without ever warning me beforehand or mentioning it once. The person has never spoken to me once (don’t know his name) in the four months and works the exact same schedule as me which forces us to bump into each other more than my actual roommates. 

I’ve had two situations where I was using the communal TV in the living room and he came home before midnight and waited in the kitchen for me to leave. I stayed about 15-30 minutes and let him know the place was clear and apologized for making him wait. He said nothing and the tv disappeared weeks later after being the living room for over 3 years. I bought my own the next day and put it in the same spot. But knowing that he communicated with my roommate to have it removed and my roommate agreed makes me feel very disrespected and confused. I’m easy-going and pay rent. If I moved out, a complete stranger would want this guy to disappear so what’s the point of all of this. No one on earth can rent out a room with a total stranger living in the living room so why make things difficult for someone who’s been paying rent for years and is a low maintenance tenant.

Tonight, a similar situation happened but I stayed in the living room watching my movie and he went to the kitchen for close to 2 hours. He then came to the living room and said that he just returned from a flight and wanted to go to sleep. I closed the tv and left. My actual roommate was around during the 2 hours and commiserated with him in the backyard instead of asking to have a conversation and maybe set some rules.

He was gone all weekend and I didn’t purposefully use the living room to be a dick but I did leave him in the kitchen because I don’t owe this stranger anything. I’ve also been passive aggressive in other ways. 

I feel like I’m in the wrong for being passive aggressive but so are he and my roommate. The man is an intimidating bouncer who could beat me left and right but he’s avoiding a conversation where he would need to set a hard move out date or I would directly ask him to move out.

This year she got a message from one of her exes which she told me about. She asked if I was okay with her replying. I told her I found it weird but I can't control who she talks to. 

She mentioned that they're now on better terms and are friends. Last month she mentioned us possibly meeting up with her ex. I told her I found it weird enough that she's messaging him but going for drinks is too far and that I would not be comfortable with that and she didn't mention it again.

It was her birthday last weekend and she wanted to go for drinks with me and a few friends instead of seeing everyone separately as she has done in previous years. The drinks were going well and everyone was having a good time and then her ex shows up. 

I ask what he's doing here and she said she invited him. I pointed out she knew I was uncomfortable with that and just disregarded that completely. 

She said it's only drinks and they're friends but I just said I'm not going to sit and have drinks with her ex and act like we're all friends so if she wants to drink with him that badly then she can do it without me. 

I then walked out. He tried talking to mw but I just told him that my relationship is none of his business.

The next day my girlfriend was angry and told me I ruined her birthday but I just pointed out she deliberately didn't tell me she invited her ex to her birthday so how exactly does she expect me to react.

96,1ea6zu3,WIBTA if I told my friend that he should drop out of university and get his life together?,"I have a friend who we shall call Hector (m29) and Hector has been in university for the last eight years now. He does not have his BA and in fact is not close to obtaining it. He initially went to school for Chemical Engineering and failed so many of his classes during that time that he was put on academic probation. During his probationary period, he failed a course and ultimately was kicked from the school of engineering. This however has not deterred Hector, since then he has changed his major to biochemistry and managed to get approvals from the dean to return to school. Hector is effectively restarting from square one with some courses that he has previously failed and I feel as though I am just going to watch history repeat itself. 

During these last eight years, Hector has worked a total of around six to twelve months. Most summers he does not work, his parents pay for his school and they give him an allowance for gas and a little extra that he uses to pay for meals and sometimes video games. When Hector has worked it has been for family friends who hired him on the spot and so hector is nearly thirty and has never had a job interview in his life. He has zero student debt due to the fact that his family has taken out a loan to pay for his schooling. He does not come from a well off family, but his parents are willing to take the financial burden if it means their son can have a better life. 

Just to put things in perspective, I also returned to university a year after Hector did and in that time I was able to get my BA, my MA and a job in my field. I don't want to sound as though I am beating up on Hector, but I don't think this is for him, when I asked him about what he plans to do for work he tells me he is unsure and that he's more interested in the title of engineering/biochemistry. At the end of the day, he isn't doing something he's good at and he is wasting thousands of his family's money to continuously fail first and second year courses. 

I genuinely think that it would be the best, for Hector and his family, if he dropped out and at least assessed his life in order to figure out what he wants to do rather than chasing a title that sounds cool. It's a hard subject to approach as he gets very defensive about school, but he's got to realize that what he is doing is not working.

I come from a middle class British Pakistani family who have a zero tolerance for alcohol consumption but I know some other ethnicities and social classes aren't as strict about it.

My sister recently got married and while her husband grew up Muslim he seems to be very liberal. He comes from a multiracial background; I know he has a small amount of Pakistani in him but also some Middle Eastern and European. My sister dated him for 2 years but she only really introduced him to her Mother's side of the family so I don't know him too well but he seems nice.

Since the wedding my cousins have had a lot of speculations about him because they found out he comes from a wealthy upper class family. One of the things they've been speculating about is whether he drinks alcohol because of some pictures they saw on his instagram and because of his background.

A little background: So my cabin neighbourhood has cabins on one side of the street and dock areas across the street and in the water. Some of the dock areas are right across the street from the cabin but my dock area is 100m down the road. Each dock area has a dock and ~25 sq.m of grass. Some properties have boathouses, some don’t. The dock areas are leased land from our provincial utility. We’ve only owned the place 1.5years.

I hauled my mower all over my cabin yard first (up a large rock face too), puttered around and was going to mow my dock area on my way back home. I didn’t want to push my mower the 100m there and back, so I loaded it up and drove there. I pulled past my property so I could mow right up to the side of the road and not hit my truck. My back was hurting and so I didn’t want to finagle with the mower trying to turn it around. I saw my neighbours just arrived and parked on the other side of the street and were unloading their vehicle for the weekend.

99,1ea6006,AITA for wanting out of my friend’s wedding(as the MOH)?,"I(F) was asked to be the MOH at my friends(F) wedding. She’s not a close friend to me but I know for a fact that she considers me to be one of her closest friends.

This is a woman who always gets into bad situations and blames the world, life or other people on them. This friend was also raised by a narcissistic mother and it shows.

We started planning the wedding well in advance and things were going well, everything according to the timeline. But throughout the process she kept complaining to me about her mother. How she kept giving advice where she it wasn’t asked for, tried to push her own way for the reception and so on. I kept mentioning that the wedding is about the people getting married and their wants and needs, and not about her mother.

Then her mom got diagnosed with cancer, it was a shock to everyone. She started chemo, life got pretty hard for her health-wise. It seemed like we weren’t even sure if she’d make it to the wedding.

As the day of came closer, the bride started hinting at me that the mom wanted to talk to me about the wedding and gave her my number. The mom messaged me that she has experience hosting weddings and if I needed any help or anything done, I could ask her. Knowing the tendencies she was showing with the bride, I politely said everything was going well, thanked her and told her I would know who to turn to if I did need help with something just to find out a few days later that she was harrassing my friend about my response.

Things went quiet for a bit, but a few weeks later I received another message from my friend, telling me her mom was harassing her again, asking why I’m not sharing any info with the brides family about what I’m planning for the reception etc. Mind you, I’ve done many weddings before and never encountered this. We are not American, so it is not common for us to be in contact with the families of the B&G, idk if it is in other countries. She wasn’t saying just that but also that she wants to meet with me ASAP, and that she’d be texting me very soon and phrasing it almost as a threat. Something like - oh just you wait if she tells me no again.

This kind of behavior is definitely not something I’m ok with and I voiced that to the bride. To that she responded - you knew what you were signing up for, you know what my mom is like. And that she understands her mother because she’s sick and alone, that she already has too much on her plate and to please just deal with it on our own.

I’m feeling a strong urge to just hop off this wedding train and also the “friendship”. This situation has made me really contemplate the entire relationship I have with this girl and I’ve come to the conclusion that all I am in this friendship, is a garbage can for her emotional waste.

It’s about a month untill the wedding. Am I the asshole for wanting to drop it? What would you do if you were me?

100,1ea5wfb,WIBTA if I decline a baby shower for me and my husband?,"I am pregnant with mine and my husband's first child. This would also be the first grandchild for his parents. My mom passed away when I was a teenager and my dad wasn't around, so no grandparents would be involved on my side. I do a sister and aunt, both of which I'm really close to. 

When we started sharing the news with our respective family, my side was over the moon and thrilled. My sister immediately jumped into being as supportive as possible. She even said she'd love to host a baby shower for us. She lives further away, but the trip is one we're use to as my husband and I visit every few months. 

My husband's side,  however, were less enthusiastic. His family doesn't show a lot of emotions to begin with, but we were expecting this news to receive more than a lukewarm reaction. We don't have a bad relationship with them, so we were hurt by this. 

Now to why we might be the assholes. 

His mom recently approached us about a baby shower that a couple of her friends would like to throw for us. She noted that is was their idea and they would do the footwork and that she may not be involved much. I have never met these ladies, but they are family friends so my husband knew them growing up. 

My main sticking point is that my husband's mom, and family in general, have not shown much interest in our pregnancy or wanting to celebrate with us. However, they're more thrilled about sharing the news with others. (They shared the news with others after asking them to wait until we were ready. We told them early within the pregnancy and wanted to wait until we were further along to make sure baby was healthy.) I want my husband's family to celebrate with us, but I don't want to be paraded around in front of people I don't know. This is such an intimate time for our growing family. I think we would feel differently if his mom was the one to host it and be more involved.

WIBTA if we nicely decline this baby shower thrown by my husband's mom's friends and only did the one hosted by my sister? 

ETA: 

1. I didn't know there was a rule about who could throw baby showers! I'm in the US and the rule that it's usually a friend or friend of the family was news to me! I've seen many baby showers thrown by sisters, moms, and other close relatives. 


2. Even though the initial reaction from his family was less than what we expected, we have tried numerous times to involve them in other ways.  Baby conversations tend to end quickly. A few people mentioned maybe there was a pregnancy loss that isn't talked about and baby conversations could be hard for them to have. My husband and I both probably won't know the root cause. I guess just because their lack of excitement to our face is evident, doesn't mean they aren't excited period. We're learning this. 


3. I've also been called out for being petty and bitter. And yeah. I agree with that also! It mainly stems from the fact that I don't have my mom here with me through this, or that my sister and aunt aren't close by. His family is a very surface level family, but they're getting the opportunity to experience this first hand when my family can't. I'm working through this. And I'm trying to not hold this against them. My husband has been extremely supportive and even suggested more regular trips to visit my sister until I can't.

102,1ea5iz4,"AITA for ‘kicking’ my close friend out of my cheerleading team next year?
","I (17F) and my friend (17F) have been part of our high school cheerleading team for years. We have another very close friend, Grace (17F), who is also on the team. We all value our friendship deeply and would never intentionally hurt each other’s feelings. However, we’ve been facing a dilemma that’s causing us a lot of stress.

Grace has a habit of missing practices, often due to ‘illness’. We suspect she might be faking it, as she seems perfectly fine in other activities she participates in and takes her academics very seriously. Her frequent absences have affected the team’s performance, and she even got us disqualified from nationals last year. Our coaches aren’t fond of her because of this and have expressed this to us.

Next year will be our last year in high school, and we really want to make the most of it in cheerleading. We’re considering two options: performing as a duo or including Grace to make it a trio. If we go with the trio, we fear Grace won’t pull her weight and will drag the team down. Additionally, next year will be academically demanding for all of us, and any extra stress from Grace’s lack of participation could negatively impact our studies and our performance.

Grace’s participation in multiple activities and her serious approach to academics mean she’s likely to miss even more training sessions. We’ve thought of a few solutions, but each has its own complications:

* Tell the coach and ask for advice: The coach might not approve and could insist we include Grace.
* Confront Grace directly: This would almost certainly lead to her taking it defensively and potentially getting very mad.
* Endure the stress\*\*:\*\* We could just suck it up, deal with the stress, and hope for the best.

We’re really torn because we don’t want to hurt Grace’s feelings or cause drama, but we also don’t want our final year of cheerleading to be marred by stress and underperformance.

AITA for not wanting Grace on our team next year?

Edit: Sorry for the confusion. Our disqualification was due to her sprained shoulder, which left us short on team members. She was injured three months before the competition but attended training regularly and followed doctors' advice to train fully. However, as the competition approached, she started sitting out and missing training, even though she claimed her shoulder was healed. On the competition day, she arrived in a cast/sling, and the judges didn’t allow her to compete, putting us under minimum numbers.

Cam said she was sorry to break the news to me there. But she was worried they had more stuff planned and it could happen at the family reunion. She also admitted the attempt by her husband and the rest of my ILs had gone SO far South and so wrong and they mostly just ignored it.

I was pissed. Emma was furious when I filled her in. She also kept apologizing to me about her family and their actions. She never expected this from her family and felt so bad that I had opened up to them, for them to betray me/us like that.

106,1ea4am3,AITA for calling my stepdad a hypocrite after asking my grandpa to walk me down the aisle at my wedding?,"My stepdad, who I (24f) called dad most of my life, is the only dad I ever knew. He met my mom when I was only 1 and they got married right after my second birthday. So I literally have no memories of my life without him. And I would say most of my life I saw him as my dad and not my stepdad. He was the male figure who raised me and was there. But I was never equal to his bio kids.

He would call me his stepdaughter when asked how many kids he had. I heard him say it, even when I was little. I always called him dad or him and mom my parents. It hurt a lot when I was younger.

My younger sister was often called ""my first baby girl"" by him. My younger brother was called his first born. And while technically they are his first bio son and daughter. I was always expected to treat him like my real dad. But he was not always claiming me as his real daughter.

Things started to change for me when I was 16. One of my friends called him my stepdad and I didn't correct him. My stepdad overheard and he told me he was hurt that after all he'd done for me I'd let him be delegated to the lesser title of stepdad. I told him I was his stepdaughter most of the time so why shouldn't he be my stepdad.

My stepdad was still good to me. It was just. Some things really hurt when I was younger, and some things pissed me off when I was older, like the incident above. I did talk to him and mom about it and I was gaslit into believing he didn't say stepdaughter or he'd say that sometimes it's important to distinguish. But none of these were doctor appointment incidents. I always felt like it would have been easier if he had been consistent with ""not my kid"" for me. At least then I wouldn't have been so confused and hurt as a younger kid.

My grandparents noticed. I think what took their notice most was when I was 8 and I was worried I couldn't be his real daughter, I asked my stepdad to adopt me and he changed the subject. My stepdad's parents and two siblings were also there and they looked shocked... that I'd asked. I was never called a granddaughter by his parents or a niece by his siblings. But they were grandma and grandpa and aunty and uncle to me.

Grandpa really stepped up for the emotional support and when Covid restrictions happened my fiancé and I moved in with him temporarily since he was alone and he knew we wanted to be in a home and not a cramped apartment. 

Which is why, when I got engaged, I asked grandpa to walk me down the aisle. My stepdad was pissed/offended again and he told me as much. I brought up how he talked about watching his two little girls get married (my two sisters) and never his three. So why would he be taking on such a big task for his not-little girl. He told me I was being so nitpicky and I told him he was a hypocrite to treat me as not a daughter but expect to be treated as a dad. He told me I didn't know the meaning of the word and I should be more appreciative of all the things he gave me.

My stepdad overheard and he told me he was hurt that after all he'd done for me I'd let him be delegated to the lesser title of stepdad. I told him I was his stepdaughter most of the time so why shouldn't he be my stepdad.

My stepdad was still good to me. It was just. Some things really hurt when I was younger, and some things pissed me off when I was older, like the incident above. I did talk to him and mom about it and I was gaslit into believing he didn't say stepdaughter or he'd say that sometimes it's important to distinguish. But none of these were doctor appointment incidents. I always felt like it would have been easier if he had been consistent with ""not my kid"" for me. At least then I wouldn't have been so confused and hurt as a younger kid.

My grandparents noticed. I think what took their notice most was when I was 8 and I was worried I couldn't be his real daughter, I asked my stepdad to adopt me and he changed the subject. My stepdad's parents and two siblings were also there and they looked shocked... that I'd asked. I was never called a granddaughter by his parents or a niece by his siblings. But they were grandma and grandpa and aunty and uncle to me.

Grandpa really stepped up for the emotional support and when Covid restrictions happened my fiancé and I moved in with him temporarily since he was alone and he knew we wanted to be in a home and not a cramped apartment. 

Which is why, when I got engaged, I asked grandpa to walk me down the aisle. My stepdad was pissed/offended again and he told me as much. I brought up how he talked about watching his two little girls get married (my two sisters) and never his three. So why would he be taking on such a big task for his not-little girl. He told me I was being so nitpicky and I told him he was a hypocrite to treat me as not a daughter but expect to be treated as a dad. He told me I didn't know the meaning of the word and I should be more appreciative of all the things he gave me.

107,1ea3cbu,AITA for defending my sister's right to keep her baby's name secret until after the birth?,"My little sister is pregnant with her first baby and our family of parents, other siblings and even aunts and uncles, are all going crazy wondering what name she's going to give her little one. My sister has been asked and she has made it clear the name is not going to be known by anyone but her and her husband until after their baby is here. We all know she's having a girl and our family have some very strong ideas about names. I think one of the reasons she's so quiet about her choice is because our family tried to get me to change the names of my three children and they were rude about my children's names; Piper, Rowan and Skye. My family prefers classic/royal family names. My kids do not have those kinds of names. The fact my husband and I announced the names before the birth really went badly for us. We were both sick of it each time. But we'd forget ourselves with the excitement of each pregnancy and we'd announce because we loved the names. Of course my family never put anything negative online because the reaction there was very positive.

I have an idea of what my future niece's name will be. Well, I have two actually, and neither name is something my family would approve of. It makes me SO proud that my sister learned from me and decided to keep quiet on the name.

Our family keep shit talking about it though and they're also trying to make her give in. They say she must have some horrible name picked out and doesn't want to be told they need to change it. Or they're under the belief she has chosen the name of someone they dislike. But I think the former is the more popular thought amongst the family. I have defended my sister each and every time the rest of the family starts this shit. I told them she and her husband have every right to wait to announce the names, that most people wait and it makes sense given their (my family's) reaction previously.

This became a fight with my parents who told me they have every right to know beforehand. I said they don't. Only the parents of the child have that right and not all babies get named beforehand anyway. They told me it wasn't my business anyway and I returned that it's also none of theirs. They are the ones trying to go against my sister and BILs wishes. I told them my sister has the right idea and they need to accept it and stop before they push her away or have limited info about their new granddaughter. They told me I was being crazy and acting like they were doing something wrong which they are not, in their mind. They told me I better not have been a bad influence on her with names. I rolled my eyes. They got so mad at me that they told me I owed the family an apology for how I have been treating them.

110,1ea2nop,AITA for not providing for my parent's retirement,"Back with the same mom issues. I recently asked her (50F) about her retirement plans, and she jokingly pointed that her kids will probably cover most of it. Since I wanted her to be more serious about it, I told her to get me (21F) and my sibling out of the picture. I just wanted an unbiased talk about her financial independency and planning after she retire, but from what I hear, she genuinely sounds like she does not have a solid plan and will most likely depend on us for income after retirement. Obviously, I'm not happy with that, she's practically setting me up to be stuck in a sandwich generation before I get the chance to even try and work myself.

She started talking about how I'm so scared of supporting her after she retires, and brings up the fact that she always spends money raising me and giving me things and whatnot. Recently I felt that she's started to give me things in order to weaponize it later on, saying how she's so gracious and I'm unfilial for treating her like that. She's still working and not that close to retirement, so I don't understand how she's already so ready to rely on her kids for financial support and she knows damn well she could just plan for the future in order to be financially independent. 

I've been taking a break from uni and started an internship that does not pay me well, and my mom has just been commenting on how she has not received a single cent from me despite doing so much. I honestly felt so weirded out, because why are you, as a 50yo working adult, eyeing the lowly salary of ur kid who also has her own saving goals and bills to pay? It's almost like stealing money from a beggar. And whenever I plan to do something, like have a nice outing with my friends or even go on dates, she would comment about how I use my money and not give her any. Like what??? Am I supposed to just hand over my savings to you? 

Obviously, I won't be abandoning my parents after they retire, but I just wish they would be more financially responsible and independent. At least so that their kids are not their primary source of income. Or at least, make an effort to start working on that now that they recognise the deep shit they are in financially, and try to work towards bettering things themselves. Expecting everything on us just seemed purely irresponsible to me.

FYI, I asked her how much she expected and she named a price to be est 10-15% of an average office worker's salary, which sounded ridiculous to me. But she thought that was the least I could do.

I want to get a shelving unit that's 78x50x171cm and has no back. It's a very light looking shelf, nothing massive, since our room is quite narrow.

Yesterday my roommate was asking about the plans, I told her what the plan is a she agreed. She did say that ""as long as nothing block the natural light I'm fine with whatever."" I ordered the shelf, rearranged my furniture and thought we were good.

Today I get bombarded with messages about her not wanting the shelf there and that it will block natural light (I explained to her MULTIPLE TIMES how, because the shelf has no backing, natural light will come in either way and that this is a common way to partition rooms without sacrificing light).

I understand her being worried. The room is kind of this long noodle and we already don't get a lot of natural light. Especially her because she's hidden in this nook behind a shelf. That being said, the shelf will be on my side, so there's no space restrictions and it will NOT BE BLOCKING LIGHT. 

I don't know what to do now. Could I cancel the order? Probably. But I feel like she should have communicated this with me yesterday, before I ordered it and made accomodations for it in our room (also moved a bunch of stuff from home to put on the shelf).

112,1ea22r4,AITA EV Etiquette for Charging Station,"Recently a new owner of a one-week-old PHEV, so I'm not sure what the proper etiquettes are when it comes to charging stations. Today, I parked in front of a free EV charger, but the plug was broken. So, I moved my car to a normal parking spot (since I wasn't charging) and headed inside one of the store in the plaza. 

45 minutes later, I checked the app and noticed that the second EV charger on the opposite side of the broken one was now available. So I head out of the store and drove over to second EV charger. When I arrived, no car was parked in the designated spot for the second EV charger and the plug was still hooked to the charging station. However, I did noticed an EV car parked in the first spot with the broken EV charger. I didn't think anything of it since the EV car was not plugged in nor was there anybody in sight. So I reversed parked into the parking spot, got out of my car, opened my port, unhooked the charger from the charging station, and was getting ready to plug it into my car when the guy comes out of his parked EV car and tells me he's been waiting for the plug and that he had parked first.

I'm standing there looking at him confused. Technically I was there first - I literally have the plug in my hand. I said to him that he's parked in the other parking spot (in front of the broken EV charger which both of us never mentioned is broken) so technically I am here first in the right designated parking spot and that I've also been waiting for an hour except I was in the store. He insisted that since he parked first, he should have the right to the plug. He continued on to ask me if I thought it was proper etiquettes. But I bluntly said I wouldn't know because I literally just purchased my car and went to ask him what are the proper etiquettes. He seem to have evaded my question and said ""if you think it's right go on ahead and use it.""

I tried compromising with the him by saying I only need 30 minutes for my PHEV (would've even settled for 15 min, but he didn't seem willingly to settle) since he had a fully electric car it would've taken much longer for him to use, and I wasn't planning on staying long. He didn't seem willing to compromise so I decided it wasn't worth my time and energy and gave in. It wasn't worth the fight since I could run on gas and wasn't planning on staying long. I just wanted enough electricity for the 3 miles home.

BTW I'd say it was about 3-6 min since checking the app to me fully parked. So at any point during that time, he could've charged his car or at least gotten out of his car and this would've never been an issue.

AITA? Should I have just left my car parked in front of the broken EV charger and waited to use the plug like him? If I had, would the roles be reversed and he'd be giving up the plug to me 3-6 min after the fact? maybe as I was getting out of the store to plug the charger in my car simply because I was parked first?

114,1ea1f4q,AITA for not switching rooms with a roommate even though our  assignments were chosen months ago?,"I (21nb) and my friends (19) leased a 4bed2baths house in March this year. We searched for a 4th roommate and found a lovely girl, call her P, she was great. 
The rent we had was 3600$ total and we decided with the landlord to split it evenly by 4, which would be 900$. Before P even signed the lease, she was given an entire house plan, including room sizes. For reference the room sizes are 12x15, 12x15, 12x12 and 13x16. house is 2 stories, with a full kitchen 2 baths living area, indoor garage & a large backyard. P had no issues with this and was happy about the rent being so low for the area. We are all college students btw. 

My friends asked if they could have the 12x15 rooms, because they have a bathroom & wash/dry between them, they wanted to share. P and I were okay with this and said so right away.    

Then the topic of the small & large room. Friends suggested we draw straws to see who gets the bigger room, and so l did a random best of 3 name draw. I won 2/ 3 times. I even felt bad and offered to go again for a different outcome but P declined and was not upset or offended. She thanked me for the fair play and never mentioned it again. Now July, we are all on the same terms, we've payed two months of rent, & suddenly P texts our group chat demanding to pay less rent because her room is small. contract says we only need to have 3600 payed, not indiv room rent, & when we discussed signing the lease we had all happily agreed on the 4x split. I can't afford to pay more than the 900$, & neither can my friends. The new rent P proposed has her paying 150$ less and me paying 100$ more, my friends 50$ more. I texted back saying I would not pay more & 900 was final. 

She did not like this, and insisted on a conference call to work things out. P is currently the only one in the house, i am on vacation w/ gf, & my friends have jobs in our home town. She never mentioned this with us all there. The call was mostly P telling us how she didn't know the room would be so small, how she was confused when we were discussing rent and rooms, and she doesn't want to pay the same amount of rent as the rest of us. All solutions were shot down, and I might be the ahole here, but I ended up getting very agitated & saying ""you should have told us months ago before our shit is moved in, you were given every opportunity to voice your concerns and never brought them up"" 

My friends & I are stuck on this bc the only other solution she has is redraw room assignments, which, why should we now move all our stuff around because she decided she was unsatisfied? We feel like we are ganging up on her, because none of us are willing to swap rooms with her or pay more, but we also feel guilty bc maybe she was confused and never felt comfortable bringing it up bc we 3 are friends? Should I have just let her have the big room, instead of drawing straws?

The rent we had was 3600$ total and we decided with the landlord to split it evenly by 4, which would be 900$. Before P even signed the lease, she was given an entire house plan, including room sizes. For reference the room sizes are 12x15, 12x15, 12x12 and 13x16. house is 2 stories, with a full kitchen 2 baths living area, indoor garage & a large backyard. P had no issues with this and was happy about the rent being so low for the area. We are all college students btw. 

My friends asked if they could have the 12x15 rooms, because they have a bathroom & wash/dry between them, they wanted to share. P and I were okay with this and said so right away.    

Then the topic of the small & large room. Friends suggested we draw straws to see who gets the bigger room, and so l did a random best of 3 name draw. I won 2/ 3 times. I even felt bad and offered to go again for a different outcome but P declined and was not upset or offended. She thanked me for the fair play and never mentioned it again. Now July, we are all on the same terms, we've payed two months of rent, & suddenly P texts our group chat demanding to pay less rent because her room is small. contract says we only need to have 3600 payed, not indiv room rent, & when we discussed signing the lease we had all happily agreed on the 4x split. I can't afford to pay more than the 900$, & neither can my friends. The new rent P proposed has her paying 150$ less and me paying 100$ more, my friends 50$ more. I texted back saying I would not pay more & 900 was final. 

She did not like this, and insisted on a conference call to work things out. P is currently the only one in the house, i am on vacation w/ gf, & my friends have jobs in our home town. She never mentioned this with us all there. The call was mostly P telling us how she didn't know the room would be so small, how she was confused when we were discussing rent and rooms, and she doesn't want to pay the same amount of rent as the rest of us. All solutions were shot down, and I might be the ahole here, but I ended up getting very agitated & saying ""you should have told us months ago before our shit is moved in, you were given every opportunity to voice your concerns and never brought them up"" 

My friends & I are stuck on this bc the only other solution she has is redraw room assignments, which, why should we now move all our stuff around because she decided she was unsatisfied? We feel like we are ganging up on her, because none of us are willing to swap rooms with her or pay more, but we also feel guilty bc maybe she was confused and never felt comfortable bringing it up bc we 3 are friends? Should I have just let her have the big room, instead of drawing straws?

116,1ea1b4k,AITA and the reason my relationship ended?  ,"This is going to be a brief description of my relationship I had with my ex gf. We started dating at 16 when we were in high school in sept 2020 and we recently just broke up in July 2024. But everytime she would talk to me about why she broke up with me it doesn't feel right. For some context everytime I was doing something wrong or not giving her enough attention in certain aspects I did my best to try and fix whatever was the issue and we always had good communication on what we needed for our relationship. However we started having some issues around December of 2023 that I thought we figured out. She instead told me that she has wanted to break up with me since December. During the last month or so i was falling into a pretty deep depressive state and so whenever i was around her i was more happy then ever because she was my safe space so I expressed it as much as i could to her because she made me so happy. She then proceeded to start distancing herself quite a lot after i made this change. When we did break up she told me that i was too late and that she should've gotten that attention from me from the beginning. I told her I thought we were doing better because she stopped bringing things up to me that I needed to do better and improve on but apparently was the exact opposite. Another issue that confuses me is that she cried her eyes out to me one time because we hadn't been very sexually active for a period of time (just out of sync with each other) and thought I didn't find her attractive in that way anymore so then when I started giving her more of that kind of attention after we moved back into our parents houses she said that I only wanted to see her for sex when I was doing what she had asked me. She told me I had to change because I get extremely competitive over games and don't like to lose and when she told me to calm down and stop yelling so much i did that and became more tame but she said it was still a problem that I didn't get any better (she never said it was still bad but apparently I didn't do enough). She complained saying that she had to beg for gifts on either Christmas or her birthday or whatever even though I told her to just send me what she wanted and I would get it for her no questions asked most the time. She complained that she wasn't on my social media enough even though in the beginning I said I was very private with my relationships and she said it was okay but became a problem when she wasn't on it very much because I didn't post a lot but I was all over hers (she never told me she wanted to be on it more and she hated when I took her photo). Obviously there is more to this but I'm gonna leave it at that for now. I still love her deeply and wish we could mend and repair or even try again but she wants nothing to do with me.

120,1ea0hns,AITA for not helping babysit my nephew?,"My brother(B), SIL & nephew(N) live 25 miles from me. Growing up, B was spoiled by our parents & has always been selfish. After marrying my controlling SIL, he only got worse. Before N was born, we met occasionally. They didn't stay in touch unless I put in the effort but had no hesitation asking for my help when they needed it. When B was sick, SIL told me to stay with them to help & I did for a couple of weeks at the cost of my work, yet B would tell everyone how SIL took great care of him, completely ignoring my contribution.

They act entitled to my help never giving me the option to decline. If I had other commitments they would get mad & sometimes complain to our parents. On the flip side, B has never been there for me. For instance, when I moved to the area after college not knowing anyone except him, not having a car while apt hunting, he didn’t help. When I got a divorce from my abusive ex, I needed a place to stay during the pandemic until I could find a new apt. I stayed at their place for 3 weeks, paid for groceries & offered to pay rent, which they declined. However, they practically abused me by making me do dishes by hand instead of dishwasher & other chores despite my chronic pain issues & particularly bad wrist pain & refusing to turn on central AC during heat waves while using a personal AC in their room.

When I got hit by COVID badly while living by myself, all I needed from B was for him to care. I messaged him, but he didn’t bother to call & check on me for over a week. After dealing with an abusive marriage & divorce, realizing that B didn’t care if I lived or died pushed me into serious depression. I decided to drop the hope of having a normal sibling relationship & started maintaining boundaries to avoid getting hurt again.

Fast forward to after they had N. I started visiting them more coz I love the kid to death. I watch him for a few hours whenever I’m at their home, helping them get other stuff done but I’ve resisted full-time babysitting. I am also there for anything related to him, like his bday party preparations. When he was born, they tried to reel me into changing diapers, but I pushed back. He is two now, & the entire time they have been making passive-aggressive comments like they don’t know what to tell their friends when they ask if I help with babysitting (which I doubt their friends ask). SIL even tells my nephew that his aunt doesn’t want him at her place & doesn’t want to spend time with him.

SIL is going on a trip for a week leaving B and N at home. She has told (not asked) me twice to stay at their place for that week & WFH to help with N. I love N dearly but feel like I shouldn’t have to do this. I would need special permission to WFH at my new job, miss my workout classes & plans with friends. And I’m sure B will take out his frustration on me whenever he gets overwhelmed and take my help for granted.

I told Chole that I was no longer comfortable with going and felt unwelcome, and explained why, (She then screenshot it and sent it to Patti). Chole said the trip was planned for my bday but we can go somewhere else. Chole then said  that she would still be going with patti during my bday. (She didn’t buy tickets or book anything yet, it wasn’t fully planned).  Chole has done similar things in the past to me with Patti and other friends. I told Chole that she ruined our friendship. Chole was really hurt by that, and we’ve been kinda cold to each over ever since. Chole has been a good friend outside of this. I feel like maybe I was wrong for what I said and for hurting her feelings? Aita for telling my friend she ruined our friendship ?

123,1ea09a6,AITA for giving my mom the silent treatment for taking my brother side?,"Hello. I am (F20) and my little brother is (M18) and he is diagnosed with autism. To keep the story straight, he does a lot of bad stuff like cursing at me and my siblings. He goes into the bathroom and makes a mess, leaving water all over the floor and the tub dirty. Every time we buy groceries, he eats everything in one day, so it's all gone the next day. He randomly gives me or my siblings attitudes or makes smart remarks when we try to talk to him. Whenever he does something wrong, he gets mad at us and tells us to leave him alone.

My mom always makes excuses for him. Every time I tell her about the stuff he’s doing wrong, she says things like, “Well, you should leave him alone; you know he has a problem,” “Leave him alone,” “He’s going through something,” or “He doesn’t need anyone nagging at him.” I get so tired of it because she never holds him accountable for what he does. She treats him like he’s a baby and says the reason he has tantrums or does what he does is because of his autism.

I have decided to give her the silent treatment at this point because there’s no way to talk to her or get her to understand what's going on. It makes me upset because when I try to explain my feelings about what he has done or is doing, instead of listening and understanding where I’m coming from, she instantly takes his side and makes me the problem.

TL;DR: Mom always takes my autistic brother's side in every situation, no matter what he’s doing wrong. I decided to give her the silent treatment because of it.

124,1ea03ur,AITA for making plans on my parents' anniversary?,"This Saturday is my parents' 40th wedding anniversary. I (31M) live at home right now and see my parents every day. In fact, yesterday we did a little barbecue and then went out for ice cream afterward.

Today, I mentioned offhandedly to my mom that I had plans on Friday and Saturday night so if she had conflicting plans, I wouldn't be available. She was taken aback and reminded me that it was her and dad's 40th anniversary on Saturday and she thought we'd be doing something special as a family. I said that I was sorry I forgot it was their anniversary, but that it was for the two of them, not for me. She then made a big deal out of it being their 40th but I pointed out that we didn't do anything special for the 20th or 30th. We did a big thing for the 25th and I said we'll do a big thing for the 50th, but I don't understand why we would for the 40th, especially seeing as my older brother lives in a different city and his wife is 8 months pregnant and they have no plans to come this weekend.

My dad agreed with me that their anniversary should be for them and joked ""it's a good thing the kids weren't around when we went on our honeymoon, or else you would have brought them too."" I also said I'd be happy to do something on Sunday since I don't have any plans that day. Her rebuttal was that their anniversary is on Saturday not Sunday, but we didn't do my birthday dinner until nearly 3 months after my birthday because she went to visit my aunt (her sister) on my birthday (my aunt's birthday is two days after mine).

125,1e9zx7m,AITA for pointing out there was still snacks in the packaging my Dad complained about?,"For context, me (F17) and my family were all chatting when he brought it up. My Father already being pissed off at something unrelated. He started up the topic with “What happened to all the snacks I brought?” I don’t remember if someone ticked him off to say that or if it was just said out of the blue. Assuming that we had ate them all. Me and my sister begin to explain that we have it in our room, with reasons I’ll get into. My Dad ends up going “Why are you hiding shit?” And “When you buy stuff you can do whatever you want with it” Which I get where he’s coming from but I stand firm on my reasoning. We try telling him we aren’t trying to keep it all to ourselves. Which we really aren’t and pretty much everyone besides one person in our family knows where they are being kept since I told them personally about it way before this whole debacle started. Reason why is because one person in the household has a major food binging problem. Whenever cookies are left out in the open they are almost immediately gone a day after. So whenever someone else wants a cookie you can guess what it comes down to. Which that alone is a whole other problem my parents (more-so my father) choose to not address healthily, and not in an argumentative or an ill manner, with said family member.



My sister ends up fetching the brownies from out of where it’s being kept and offers him to take since we thought he started the argument cause he wanted one. He says no. And we’re asking why is it being brought up if we’re showing you that it wasn’t all gone and indirectly saying he knows the reason why since he screams about it later. He says that he wouldn’t hide stuff from none of us. And how we were selfish and eating everything. I end up calling him an asshole in the middle of him yelling at us about this which was pretty bad on my part. At this point my mom is holding the pack of brownies. So me being petty, and my dad acting like it was all gone, I started to individually count the amount of brownies in said pack. Getting into the nitty gritty.. There are 15 brownies in 1 pack. And out of the 15 brownies, 3 brownies had been taken out during the course of a week. So there’d be 12 of them left. After I did that my Dad tried snatching the pack out of my Mom’s hand with her trying to stop him from taking it. He ended up dropping the brownies and the remote in his hand on the floor and it scattered everywhere. Me and my sister locking ourselves up in the room. 



He began to complain about everyone taking advantage of him and to not buy snacks anymore. Saying some pretty nasty stuff about all of us. Ended up calling the family member in question a slur, which isn’t the first time he’s done this, saying, “Just say it. This is all about them isn’t it?” Every time this ends up happening it has me questioning the way he acts around us. And overall this being mentally draining.

127,1e9z9rz,AITA for chewing out at my aunt for making a comment about my Mom's kitchen?,"A few weeks ago, my parents started renovating our apartment. They started adding things like recessed lights, LED strips, adding new appliances, but the biggest change they've made is opening our kitchen. For context, the kitchen is super small, (like a 3x4 Minecraft lot) considering we live in an apartment/condo. It used to have a divider wall with a cutout that's like a little serving window. They took out the wall and replaced it with a counter slab. (I apologize if you can't imagine this.)

Naturally, with every addition/removal my parents made while renovating the home, they ended up sharing it with their close work friends, let's call them Sandy and Vincent. My parents both work at the same company, and so do Sandy and Vincent. My parents met them in 2018 first.  The past few months, I've noticed that Sandy is always making passive aggressive, rude, and almost jealous comments disguised as teasing and jokes towards my mom.There are several instances that I can name, like when we go out, Sandy will wear clothes that don't exactly fit the occasion and will pick on my mom for 'dressing too much' when she just dresses too much under. Also, Sandy always ""leads"" the adults everywhere. She's like the one kid in elementary that was the leader of her group and everyone did everything she wanted.

The problem started when the recessed lights got done and Sandy and Vincent came over. Sandy immediately started saying, ""The lights are too bright, you shouldn't have gotten them done."" She made a few more comments about other fan fixtures and things. My final straw was when our kitchen got opened a few days ago and Sandy and Vincent came to see it. Sandy said, ""This marble isn't good, it looks low quality. You look really small, (my mom is only 4'11) and the smell of your food will spread all over."" Her face was scrunched in a disgusted expression. My mom just looked defeated. Her words really started getting my blood boiling. 

I had enough, and I ended up raising my voice at her. I proceeded to talk about how her house was always dirty, and she had to have been jealous considering ours was almost always clean, and how she can act like she has amazing taste in interior design when she can't even dress herself appropriately. I finally ended off saying something along the lines of, ""You will never be above my mom,"" and she was seething with anger at that point. She started refuting me talking about how she always treated me like her own child. That was true, but not all the time. She could treat me like I was pure gold, but that wouldn't take away from the fact that she was ALWAYS disrespecting my mom.

i am not really a big spender and i do really want to save my money. if i want something i will just add it to the birthday/ Christmas list. i started working in early march so i have a good amount of money saved up that i haven’t spent. recently my brothers gf has been staying with us for long periods of time. at first i didn’t really have a problem with it bc she was really nice but then things out of my room started to go missing and she started to be very rude to me. 

when i told my brother he would just shrug it off saying that she is going through things at home and was a little tense. i believed him bc she usually is really nice to me. but then very valuable thing and birthday cash started to go missing from out of my room. my best friend got me and matching pandora rings for my birthday but the suddenly when missing. my ear rings and jewelry started going missing and i literally tore up the whole house looking for them. my mom and dad were also getting mad bc my money and other things was going missing. 

my mom confronted my older brother about this and told him that it was probably his girlfriend taking my pricier things and he got really mad saying that she would never do that that. 

yesterday i came home earlier from work because they were over staffed for the night so they let me off early, i came home and went in my room to find her LITERALLY DIGGING THROUGH MY ENVELOPE!!!! 

obvi i got hella mad and started yelling at her. like why the hell are you stealing from a 16 year old!! she got mad at me and started yelling back saying she was just looking for something. you were looking for something in my money envelope…

my mom and brother came in my room to ask what happened and i told them. i expected my brother to defend me but he started yelling at me for accusing her of stealing bro. like wth…

me and my mom started yelling at him and he was defending her and she was crying… my mom told her that she was mental and needed to leave the house. my brother got mad called me an asshole and left w her.

everyone tells me it’s not my fault but now my brother won’t speak to me. i have no clue why he believes her when she was LITERALLY holding my envelope in her hands the entire time this was going on but whatever.

she dm’ed on insta saying i was an asshole for ‘lying’ and ‘trying to break up there perfect relationship’

edit: hello!! thanks for responding to this post and i am very grateful for all your opinions! 

there is some things that i will like to clear up. i do have a bank account! the money that was in the envelope was money from my birthday that just recently passed. in my family extended family usually give me money in instead of gifts. there are also chinese new year money in this envelope (like i said i don’t really like spending my money) so in the envelope there was about 450 ish dollars in there before it started going missing. this all started happening 2 and half weeks ago. now i only have 210 in the envelope.

130,1e9yx67,AITA for complaining about my daughters teacher,"I feel mostly sure I did the right thing but it's 4am and I'm second guessing everything.

A few months ago my daughter, K (15), had a weird thing where she was getting numbness and tingling in her legs and occasional bouts of nausea. She was diagnosed with a folic acid deficiency and has been on supplements. Mostly seems a lot better.

Last week though, she came home from a school trip extremely upset and with such bad pins and needles she was struggling to walk. She told me that it had hit, quite suddenly, on a school trip and when they got the bus back to school she asked if she could just stay on it to go straight home. The teacher said no (rightly) and took her back to school but she didn't contact me. By the time they reached school K was being propped up by other kids who eventually had to semi carry her to the bus stop and then did the entire hour long bus journey by herself. Neither me or my Co parent were called. One of us could have got her but nobody got in touch. Rather than explaining that it's a safeguarding thing, the teacher said ""I can't let you leave because I cant lose another child"". I asked what she meant and apparently another child fell asleep on the bus to the trip, missed the stop, and ended up at the wrong stop. The teacher found the child and brought them back to the trip and then told the kids not to tell anyone in case she (the teacher) got in trouble.

I contacted the schools safeguarding team because regardless of how they *actually* handled the lost kid, joking that 15 year old kids should not tell their parents something in case an adult gets into trouble is... less than ideal. And I know that school policy is to call home if a kid is unwell. Instead they made her walk a lot further, propped up on other children and let her leave school, knowing full well she had an hour long journey, when she couldn't walk properly. 

The school safeguarding team responded very quickly and are doing an investigation. I'm not trying to get anyone fired here (and am assured by teachers I know that it's unlikely anyone will be) I just want to be clear exactly what happened and why I wasn't contacted.

Today K came home from school very upset. Apparently she needed ear defenders and SEN was shut so she was sent to the teacher to get earplugs (she's the music teacher). Rather than just handing over the earplugs the teacher told K that the head of year was ""stressed out about the end of year trip"" because of  K and got upset with K for telling me. K said that I was upset that nobody called me and the teacher asked why she should have to be the one to contact me. 

Here's where I might be TA.  I sent a quite angry email about this.

I got a follow from the school and they've assured me they'll be investigating. It sounds as if this teacher may have former for this kind of thing and she's about to go on mat leave. Maybe I should have just left it? Next year is K's last year at that school anyway so K may not even have her again.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-23,"AITA for complaining about my daughters teacher I feel mostly sure I did the right thing but it's 4am and I'm second guessing everything.

A few months ago my daughter, K (15), had a weird thing where she was getting numbness and tingling in her legs and occasional bouts of nausea. She was diagnosed with a folic acid deficiency and has been on supplements. Mostly seems a lot better.

Last week though, she came home from a school trip extremely upset and with such bad pins and needles she was struggling to walk. She told me that it had hit, quite suddenly, on a school trip and when they got the bus back to school she asked if she could just stay on it to go straight home. The teacher said no (rightly) and took her back to school but she didn't contact me. By the time they reached school K was being propped up by other kids who eventually had to semi carry her to the bus stop and then did the entire hour long bus journey by herself. Neither me or my Co parent were called. One of us could have got her but nobody got in touch. Rather than explaining that it's a safeguarding thing, the teacher said ""I can't let you leave because I cant lose another child"". I asked what she meant and apparently another child fell asleep on the bus to the trip, missed the stop, and ended up at the wrong stop. The teacher found the child and brought them back to the trip and then told the kids not to tell anyone in case she (the teacher) got in trouble.

I contacted the schools safeguarding team because regardless of how they *actually* handled the lost kid, joking that 15 year old kids should not tell their parents something in case an adult gets into trouble is... less than ideal. And I know that school policy is to call home if a kid is unwell. Instead they made her walk a lot further, propped up on other children and let her leave school, knowing full well she had an hour long journey, when she couldn't walk properly.

This keeps happening and I am struggling to help the situation. So I(19 F) am dating boyfriend (19m) and have been for a few months now. We both are very humorous especially when it comes to joking around with each other about one another. Now situations such as this has happened before, but tonight in particular has really made me upset/sad. We were joking around as usual, cuddling chatting in bed and having a good time. We planned on watching a movie, maybe getting dessert and just staying up for a bit. As we were joking around I was getting a chuckle out of his low muttering with random words sticking out to me. I told him how funny it sounded and he began doing it more, choosing the select words I hear and making me laugh more. Here is where I am probably the asshole. He mumbles around and chooses to say the words “man titties” ( I know, out of the ordinary but that’s just our humor) and I began to laugh. I then responded with “like yours” in a jokingly manner and he immediately stopped and shut down. Now here is the thing, my boyfriend in no way has “man titties” and it was simply a deflection joke that I really should not have made. But immediately after he turns around and stops talking to me entirely, resulting in him falling asleep beside me. And honestly I’m hurt, situations like this have happened before, we will be joking around, having fun, and then I open my mouth and say something that just completely ruins the mood. Whether that’s something taken out of context, or just offends him. I never want to intentionally offend my boyfriend. He is the most incredible person I have ever known, and I don’t want to lose him. But I feel like every time I try to talk or joke back it always blows up in my face or offends him. Maybe I should just stop joking entirely, so that I don’t risk getting him hurt. But I feel like that’s unfair because I take joking/offensive comments made by him all the time because I know he doesn’t genuinely mean it. It’s all a joke. So then I ask, am I the asshole?

i am the last server there, the bartender is turning off lights, and it’s now an hour after close. i have been waiting patiently for them to leave so that i can clean off their table and go home myself. i am tired and getting irritated at this point. if i wasn’t working all day the next day i might’ve been more relaxed about it.

she has her child in their car carrier on the table. they are all standing up, so i take that time to go over and politely ask if it’s okay if i clean off their table quickly and then she can place her kid back. she moves her child and i start picking up the trash and go to throw it away. i am about to wipe down the table when she puts her kid back. i do not say a word and just walk away.

a man at the table starts calling me disrespectful, the worst server they’ve ever had, how he never wants me to serve them again, and storms out. i am standing there speechless. i couldn’t get a word out before everyone else follows. the worst part is, i was serving that guy water the whole night, so he was not intoxicated to my knowledge. 

the stress of the whole situation brought me to tears. the restaurant itself brings in horribly mannered customers and workers. the drama itself is enough to bring any sensible person to insanity. i consider myself very kind and understanding to all. it wasn’t like you had the entirety of the restaurant to yourselves!

to make it worse, they started saying i had been rude the night before when i wasn’t even serving them. it bothers me because this is my only job despite applying for others. i do not make enough $ to have people threaten my character, and if i had defended myself i would be jobless. 

i asked myself if i was the problem. i even asked another server to please tell me if i did something wrong so i could do better. yes i am mentally spiraling over this.

I recently found a job that pays extremely well and aligns with my sports and school schedules, so I decided to treat my brother to ice cream with my newfound riches (first paycheck). I picked him up from his friend’s house to surprise him, and on the drive to the ice cream store he told me that he was jealous of my job, and that he deserved it more. I was curious and asked why, and his reasoning was “you always get what you want”. Now this can and cant be true — our parents are divorced so I have more privileges, but i also have more responsibilities, and in the past he’s seen all of the privileges as me having more than him and that’s that. I told him that I earned my job and it took a lot of bad paying jobs to get here, so I don’t understand why he thinks that. He said that it’s unfair that he can’t just get a job now at 14, and i gently told him its because (in our state) they prefer to hire 16 year olds. I tried sympathizing with him by saying i understand its frustrating, but when you start working you’ll wish you never got hired in the first place. He ended up going on a rant about how mom never gives him what he wants and that I always end up being picked over him.

I understand that he’s still just a kid, he hasn’t even entered high school yet, but he has a hard time understanding that he cant just be an adult right when he wants to be (and I get it, we’ve all been his age before). But i wanted to point out that his behavior regarding getting his way is out of control, and being told “no” is okay sometimes, but he didn’t listen and just continued to blame me for him not having friends and mom being mad at him all the time.

135,1e9yawe,AITA for accusing my friend of being toxic,"So I am a 36M and my close friend of around fifteen years - “David” (35M) - recently separated from his wife (34F) of over seven years.

Since then, I’ve noticed patterns of behavior from David that have started to concern me.  We started working at the same restaurant.  David told me that his goal was to see what women who worked there he could “get with.”  He “settled on” a fellow server, “Tracy,” a 23F.  The age gap between them kind of surprised me, but hey, they’re adults.  He started really fixating on her and it seemed like his mood was dictated on how much attention she did or did not give to him.  He also started sharing with me sexually intimate details - talking about how she sucked his dick the night before, or he ate her out this night, etc.  I told him he didn’t need to tell me every detail.

One night, David got off work a little earlier than me and told me him and Tracy were going to have a drink at another bar and that I should join.  Within thirty minutes of me being there, Tracy went inside to use the restroom and David told me “Hey man, so I’m gonna need you to fuck off because I’m gonna try to fuck Tracy.”  I was pretty shocked by this, as it was very unlike him.  But I left anyway.

Another night, he had invited me to come join him for a drink when he got off work, and when I arrived he was sitting with two (young) girls, trying to flirt with them.    These two young girls were patrons he had waited on, and after they closed out he said he was about to get off and if he could join them.  I guess they said yes. David completely ignored me the entire time except one time he walked passed me and said “dude, this is great - it’s like practice for me.”  And that word practice just seemed really gross to me.

A couple of weeks ago, David and I were hanging at a bar with another one of our coworkers, and he brought up Tracy. He said that if he had had his own place by now, he totally would have fucked her.   I had enough.  I called David out on how he kept talking about Tracy and how she seemed less like a person to him and more of a conquest.  I also told him he kept worrying about how he doesn’t want to seem like he’s pressuring her (which he kept bringing up because of the age gap) but when he keeps talking about her this way, that he probably IS pressuring her.  I told him his behavior has become toxic.  He was upset by this, saying he is just looking for someone, that his ex-wife is seeing other men, why can’t he see other women?  I told him competing with her was unhealthy.

I’ve talked to some other friends as well, and they seem to be of the mind that he is just going through a rough patch.  So maybe I’m overblowing all of this.  Maybe David is in fact going through a rough patch and I was a dick for calling him toxic.

136,1e9xzlc,AITA for leaving the trip early after being embarrassed me at dinner?,"Last year, my friend, Kelsey, moved to a new city about 4 hours away. She invited me up to stay the weekend and I said sure. While planning, she asked what I wanted to do. I said I don’t mind, she could arrange whatever. As long as I can hang out with her, it’s all good. The one thing I did plan was for us to go to a concert that Sunday afternoon that both of us were looking forward to!

Saturday, we went out into the city and were walking around. She’d point to various shops and I’d say sure. We’d go in, look around.  I thought we were having a good time. She did ask me a couple of times what I wanted to do and I said I didn’t know, if she knew of anything fun, let me know. But I also said just what we were doing was nice. All in all, we walked around, got a bite to eat, looked at a few shops and then it was time for dinner with her family. We were supposed to meet them at a specific train station, however they missed their train. Kelsey seemed irritated but I figured it was due to that and worried we’d miss our reservations. I was trying to assure her it’d be okay, even called the restaurant to say we’d be a little late. When her parents arrived, however, she went and sat next to her mom on the train, glaring at me the entire way to the restaurant. I was really confused as it was a 180. 

As we’re sitting down to eat, her mother asks what we did that day, Before I can speak, Kelsey says “nothing. She didn’t know what she wanted to do.” I chuckled a little and was going to say I had a good time, when Kelsey interrupts and says “it’s not cute. It was actually really annoying.” I was taken aback because she said nothing about being annoyed all day. She was making little jabs at me for not coming up with ideas. Even her parents were side-eyeing her. It was pretty embarrassing. I really didn’t know what to do. If she had said something earlier, we could’ve talked. But I didn’t want to make things more awkward for her family. The whole dinner, she gave me nasty looks 

Eventually, we part ways with her family and go back to my hotel. She’s still irritated. I asked where this came from and why she didn’t bring it up all day? She told me that it shouldn’t be up to her to plan this. I was taken aback because never once did she ask me to plan anything. 

Come morning, I reached out to her to ask what time we were leaving for the concert. She gave me an attitude. I finally said “you know what? I’ll forward you your ticket and sell mine. If you’re still this irritated with me, I don’t think we should go”. Suddenly, she started crying, saying I was being unfair, that I should just apologize. I said I did apologize at dinner AND the hotel for not coming up with things to do, but I was also happy with what she did and she should’ve communicated better.

I did as I promised and left. I was able to get a refund from the venue for my ticket. I got an early train back. Kelsey is still very upset with me and says she wasn’t wrong.

But I didn’t want to make things more awkward for her family. The whole dinner, she gave me nasty looks 

Eventually, we part ways with her family and go back to my hotel. She’s still irritated. I asked where this came from and why she didn’t bring it up all day? She told me that it shouldn’t be up to her to plan this. I was taken aback because never once did she ask me to plan anything. 

Come morning, I reached out to her to ask what time we were leaving for the concert. She gave me an attitude. I finally said “you know what? I’ll forward you your ticket and sell mine. If you’re still this irritated with me, I don’t think we should go”. Suddenly, she started crying, saying I was being unfair, that I should just apologize. I said I did apologize at dinner AND the hotel for not coming up with things to do, but I was also happy with what she did and she should’ve communicated better.

I did as I promised and left. I was able to get a refund from the venue for my ticket. I got an early train back. Kelsey is still very upset with me and says she wasn’t wrong. AITA?",0.0,0.9628129601478577,1,0

So rather than pay for more therapy sessions, I suggested for each anger outburst from either of us, it would be $15. She reluctantly agreed with this, and she had to pay up today. She flared up at me for some nonsense (being quite disrespectful), to which I made the money gesture with my fingers, and she called me an asshole. I left and when she texted me, I told her to e-transfer me. She again asked me why I have to be an asshole?. I really think I'm in the right here.

138,1e9xmxs,AITA if I leave my bfs family vacation early,This is my 25f 2nd year on my bfs 25m family vacation. The 1st year was not a walk in the park but I thought I learned and prepared for this one. For context the vacation is a lake trip about 1.5 hr from home and everything is completely paid for by my bfs parents. I am very different from my bf as in I am very introverted and not the best sharer while he and his family are very open and nothing is off limits. The main objective of the whole vacation is to get drunk but I am not a drinker and I also don’t like my bf drinking because he can’t do so without blacking out because otherwise “what’s the point”. Either way I prepared to participate and brought 1 boxed twisted tea for myself as well as 2boxes of other canned hard drinks and numerous loose variety cans left from previous parties to share. Last we had the issue of every drinking the alcohol I brought because they only buy beer but don’t actually like to drink it. After about an hour of being at the house my boyfriend his friends and his brother were drinking straight out of the bag. When I confronted my bf about it later he said he would buy me something else but made a big deal about it. He even wrote my name on the box basically just to be a dick. It was embarrassing and not even effective as everyone STILL drank from the pack. the next morning I took out a paddle board I had bought before the trip to blow up to use. Everyone came out while him and his dad blew it up talking using it. I made many comments about how it was brand new and I just bought it obviously never used it. Later in the day while I was napping they all decided to take it out and use it without asking or even telling me. When I got up my bf graciously offered me a “turn” on my own board. I declined clearly irritated. Once it started to rain and I was alone w my bf I expressed again how I was upset. He basically brushed off how I felt about it and stood his ground no one was in the wrong because why bring it if no one could use it and if I was really upset he will just go take it away from everyone and tell them I don’t share. Aside from the pushing of clear boundaries he constantly blames me that he can’t have fun because I won’t do anything even though I tell him to go do whatever the activity is that he wants to do. His family is constantly taking my photo and posting online after I said I don’t want my pictures taken and actively dodge ones I see coming.

139,1e9xf2x,AITA for not going to a party when the original plans were getting ice cream? ,"I (20F) have been friends with Kim (20F) for 5 years. I have always had a difficult time in big crowds due to my autism and tend to hang out in smaller groups. I’m especially uncomfortable around people I don’t know well. Kim is aware of this. Even though both of us are at different points of our lives now, we still try to get together. I know she’s made a new group of friends through work but I hadn’t met any of them. 

 6 months ago, Kim began dating this guy, Paul. She asked if I wanted to meet him and I said yes. We agreed to meet up for ice cream. 

We waited a bit for Paul to show up at the ice cream place. That’s when he texted Kim that he was with a large group of their friends and asked if he could bring them along. She told me “I’m texting him yes, you need to meet everyone!!” I was about to say I’m not really comfortable being around that many people but she had already sent the text saying “yes”. I decided to try to suck it up and make it work, as I didn’t want to be difficult.

It was a lot. At least 10 people showed up. They all introduced themselves and I tried to keep up with the conversation but began to feel very uncomfortable. They didn’t seem too interested in talking to me, more each other which I get as they don’t know me. and I’m fine with Kim hanging out with her friends. But I was very much on the outside of the entire situation. I felt very uncomfortable. Even the cashier noticed and (privately) asked if I needed to call someone to pick me up. I said no.

Eventually, everyone is ready to leave. Kim, Paul and I were supposed to go back to Kim’s place to watch a movie. That’s when Kim announces “we’re going to (insert other friend’s house) for a little get together”. More people would be there. I pulled her aside and said I really wasn’t comfortable with this and asked if we could just go back to her place. I pointed out I felt super anxious and was getting over stimulated. She told me I’d be fine. I said I really wasn’t up for it, so I’d just head home and see her later. She got irritated and said “let’s just go!”

We went back to her place, Paul went with their friends. As we settled in to watch the movie, Kim kept looking at her phone and talking about how much fun it looked like everyone was having. I encouraged her to go, have fun, it’s just not my scene. She got mad and asked why I couldn’t just “suck it up”. I pointed out me sucking it up was hanging out with her friends and being uncomfortable and left out for a few hours at the ice cream place. I pointed out I didn’t mind then but the party was never a part of our original plans and I would’ve told her from the jump I wasn’t going to that part of the night. Finally, I told her to just go to the party and I’d go home, I don’t want to keep arguing or have her resent me.

I went back to my place. She didn’t text me all weekend. Tonight, she finally did and said I embarrassed her in front of her friends and Paul. That I could’ve sucked it up for one night.

140,1e9x5nh,AITAH for screaming at strangers?,"I was out for dinner at a nice, small restaurant.  A few tables away was a group of 5 women and a very young little girl who were already eating.  Pretty soon after we sat down, the little girl started screaming and no one at the table did anything. They didn't shush her or pick her up or take her outside. They just kept eating while she screamed for about 20 min and then they took her out of the high chair and let her run around the table. 

She wasn't really screaming at this point, but she was running around near/in the hallway to the bathrooms and outdoor seating and the waitresses had to walk around her, so I kept looking over at them and I think one woman didn't like it because she started shooting dirty looks at me and my adult daughter. 

This went on for a while. Their whole table had finished eating and paid the check, but they sat there chatting while the kid ran around. Maybe half an hour or so. In the meantime, we got our food, ate, paid the check and then we happened to be walking out just after them. 

We were close enough to hear them complain about us staring at them. My daughter yelled ""that's because you suck"" and booed at them. That started a yelling match. The woman who had been giving us dirty looks started yelling that we had been giving dirty looks to a kid. My daughter yelled back. We started to walk away and one of them yelled to me and said I should know better because I'm a mom and I should remember what it's like to have a little one. I said I do remember and I never let her scream for half an hour in a restaurant. She said it wasn't that bad. I was so frustrated with the stupidity of the whole thing and I kind of snapped and doubled down on the stupidity. I said ""yeah, everyone loves listening to screaming"" and started screaming as we walked away. 

A friend said my daughter is an AH for not ignoring them talking about us and I'm am AH.for screaming.  So, I'm coming to the experts for the verdict: AITAH?

ETA: we definitely looked over at the table, but we didn't shoot them any dirty looks. We weren't staring or scowling or anything, just reactively glancing over.

142,1e9wwxd,WIBTA for Not Taking My Brother To The Taylor Swift Concert with Me? ,"Backstory: I (F19) am a lifelong TS fan, like from when I was 3 or 4, so my family has always been up to date with TS's songs, albums, etc. In the fall with the Ticketmaster mess I was unable to get tickets and sad/upset about it. I had asked my brother and parents to use their ticket master accounts to also sign up for to be fans for the pre-sales but they didn't. Well last summer about 2 weeks before the concert in my city I got selected for a Ticketmaster sale where they were selling about 200 random tickets that didn't get sold after the site crashed. Long story short I was able to get 4 tickets, one went to me (F18)(these are the ages from that summer), one went to my brother M(16), one went to a mutual friend (F15) (we played our sport together),  and one went to a lifelong family friend F (21). Leading up to the concert was fun but a blur, I made a ton of friendship bracelets and had to figure out what my outfit was gonna be (if you're unfamiliar these are both a big part of being a fan and going to the Eras Tour Concerts) My brother was excited, but didn't want to dress up or make/wear any friendship bracelets. I literally had to tell him I would give the ticket to another friend if he wasn't going to dress up at all. In the end he worse a shirt that said getaway car with a picture of a vintage car on the back and wore the 2 friendship bracelets I made for him and I was happy that he did that. The concert was amazing, I don't think I sat down the whole time and I could barely talk after. My brother seemed to have fun and knew the words to about half the songs but it was like he was having the time of his life like me and the other girls. 

The Situation: I was able to score 4 floor tickets to the second to last night of the tour. (asked fam again to sign up for pre-sales they didn't and said I was crazy cause there was no way, they even all told me not to buy the tickets once I knew I would be included in the pre-sale) Originally I thought it might be nice for my whole family (mom dad brother and me) to go and make it a family thing since they've indulged me being a fan and making them listen to the songs for almost the last two decades. My dad was interested and said he would go if the whole fam does but said he feels weird about taking a ticket away from someone who is probably a much bigger fan then he is, my mom is short like 5'3 and decided she didn't want to go cause its floor seats and she think she wouldn't be able to see anything (honestly make sense). Cause the whole fam was no longer going I said it might be nice to just take a friend and sell the other tickets. I don't need the money, my family does fine, but I was a student athlete in college but had to leave cause of an injury so now I don't really have a job (im recovering from this injury and the doctors are worried a full or even part time job could impact it, Im know that sounds weird but im not going to go into all the injury drama here). For anyone who has questions, no my parents don't make me pay rent, or food or anything like that im just talking spending/saving money. I am ethically conflicted about selling them at the market rate but I paid under 1,000 per ticket and they are selling for minimum 2-3,000 each and I bought them knowing if I couldn't go I could at least for sure break even. Anyway back to the brother, he says he wants to go but if he did he would likely miss school or we could have to take a late Friday flight and drive 3 hours to the city or fly in Saturday morning of the concert, which I don't really want to do. Also, my parents would come with us, and we would likely stay outside the city cause hotels are at like 1,000 a night right now. My parents and brother are also talking about going and doing college tours on Sunday and either flying back late Sunday or Monday so that he could tour at least one if not two colleges. I on the other hand don't want to overdo myself and would prefer to just sell one or two tickets and suck it up and stay in a hotel so that I don't have a long car ride back after the concert (my parents would drive but I get very carsick so its not like I can be sleeping). When my aunt heard I have tickets she said she would be interested in going with me as she is a fan, she probably knows about as many or maybe a few more songs than my brother but unlike him who is fed but after living with me (a fan) for years, she's always down to talk about my theories on what album comes out next, what the best outfits are, and is prepared to have friendship bracelet making dinners before we go (if we go together). She is with me on the just pay for a hotel for one night cause getting out of the city is a pain and we could fly out anytime Friday and come back whenever Sunday. It's the same timeline but not as much squished in and I love my family but traveling is stressful and I just want this to be fun, for example if I wanted to get there early to get merch my brother would make a fuss and my parents would tell me not to spend the money (this is what happened last time) my aunt would be fine as long as she could sit somewhere while I was in line lol. 

I just feel like as much as I love my brother and as fun as it was to go last time, I just feel like he wants to go but he isn't and huge fan and it would be this big inconvenience to fly out, get ready, then drive like 2 hours to the concert, two hours back to the hotel after, and then possibly do college tours the next day? or even day after. And the concert itself was fun with him last time, but it was a fight to even get him to wear a themed shirt, and my aunt is sending outfit options/ideas as I am typing this out. I would consider taking both of them but then that's 5 people to travel with, so minimum 2 hotel rooms (possibly 2 different hotels?) and its much harder to sell one ticket alone then a pair. My parents want me to take my brother but it would just make this so much more complicated and I feel like he would just harsh my vibe honestly. I want to be extra and have fun and go all out but he just does not seem into it, but I also feel bad cause he's my little brother and I know he thinks he basically already owns one ticket (he's talked about selling his to make money or selling this one and getting worse tickets on resale for cheaper and keeping the extra $)

I don't need the money, my family does fine, but I was a student athlete in college but had to leave cause of an injury so now I don't really have a job (im recovering from this injury and the doctors are worried a full or even part time job could impact it, Im know that sounds weird but im not going to go into all the injury drama here). For anyone who has questions, no my parents don't make me pay rent, or food or anything like that im just talking spending/saving money. I am ethically conflicted about selling them at the market rate but I paid under 1,000 per ticket and they are selling for minimum 2-3,000 each and I bought them knowing if I couldn't go I could at least for sure break even. Anyway back to the brother, he says he wants to go but if he did he would likely miss school or we could have to take a late Friday flight and drive 3 hours to the city or fly in Saturday morning of the concert, which I don't really want to do. Also, my parents would come with us, and we would likely stay outside the city cause hotels are at like 1,000 a night right now. My parents and brother are also talking about going and doing college tours on Sunday and either flying back late Sunday or Monday so that he could tour at least one if not two colleges. I on the other hand don't want to overdo myself and would prefer to just sell one or two tickets and suck it up and stay in a hotel so that I don't have a long car ride back after the concert (my parents would drive but I get very carsick so its not like I can be sleeping). When my aunt heard I have tickets she said she would be interested in going with me as she is a fan, she probably knows about as many or maybe a few more songs than my brother but unlike him who is fed but after living with me (a fan) for years, she's always down to talk about my theories on what album comes out next, what the best outfits are, and is prepared to have friendship bracelet making dinners before we go (if we go together). She is with me on the just pay for a hotel for one night cause getting out of the city is a pain and we could fly out anytime Friday and come back whenever Sunday. It's the same timeline but not as much squished in and I love my family but traveling is stressful and I just want this to be fun, for example if I wanted to get there early to get merch my brother would make a fuss and my parents would tell me not to spend the money (this is what happened last time) my aunt would be fine as long as she could sit somewhere while I was in line lol. 

I just feel like as much as I love my brother and as fun as it was to go last time, I just feel like he wants to go but he isn't and huge fan and it would be this big inconvenience to fly out, get ready, then drive like 2 hours to the concert, two hours back to the hotel after, and then possibly do college tours the next day? or even day after. And the concert itself was fun with him last time, but it was a fight to even get him to wear a themed shirt, and my aunt is sending outfit options/ideas as I am typing this out. I would consider taking both of them but then that's 5 people to travel with, so minimum 2 hotel rooms (possibly 2 different hotels?) and its much harder to sell one ticket alone then a pair. My parents want me to take my brother but it would just make this so much more complicated and I feel like he would just harsh my vibe honestly. I want to be extra and have fun and go all out but he just does not seem into it, but I also feel bad cause he's my little brother and I know he thinks he basically already owns one ticket (he's talked about selling his to make money or selling this one and getting worse tickets on resale for cheaper and keeping the extra $) 

 Would I be the asshole to just take my aunt with me a sell the other two tickets rather than trying to take my brother?",,1.0261523723602295,1,0

I (21f) have been dealing with some health issues for almost a full two years at this point. ER visits, a bunch of antidepressant recommendations and therapy referrals, appointments filled with Drs telling me it’s all in my head. I gave up on the idea of anyone actually figuring out what was wrong with me and just tried to live with it after 10 months of no actual help from medical professionals.

It’s been hard to handle school and even harder to balance work too bc of how sick I’ve been but I’m doing the best I can.

150,1e9vang,AITA for keeping money from a item I sold,"I (M18) am in an argument with my cousin (M19).

Context: 
Me and my cousin split a gym membership when we can bring a guest in. It’s about $15 a month. My cousin recently got a new, well paying job and had taken over the payments for a few months when I had forgotten and/or my job wasn’t letting me pick up any shifts. So I owe him about $50-60. Right about now I’ve been surviving off $60 a week that I get IF I go to work on Sunday, so I haven’t gotten to paying him back.


Now,
Last week, I was on the process of helping my cousin do some summer cleaning. While sorting out his bedroom, he rediscovered a modded DS with some cool games on it. After playing on it for a while, reliving some memories, he decided that it wasn’t a keep and to get rid of it. He decided to give it to me, and I said that I could get some decent money off of it on EBay (and finally pay him what I owe   him). I said okay, and that if I got it to sell, I’d finally pay him what I owe him. I put it up immediately and got a few texts, with one guy saying he could pick it up ASAP. My cousin left to go hangout his friends and said that if I don’t sell it I could just give it to my little brother to play with. After I left, I went to the pickup site that me and the guy off EBay decided to and sold the whole thing for around $250. After getting the money I ended up paying my friend (who I’d owe $40), my cousin (who I ended up paying $75, about 15 more than I owed him), and got my self a 4for$4 deal from Wendy’s. When I got home I told my cousin that I’d pay him, but then he asked where the rest was, to which I was quite confused. He demanded that I pay him the entirety of the amount that I ended up selling it for and that it was his game system and therefore it’s his money. I rebutted by saying that he’d gave it to ME and I ended up selling it, and that if he really wanted the money he’d had sold it his self. 

After going back and forth for about 10 minutes, we settled that I’d send him another 20 and we’d be good. 
So in the end, I sent him around $95 and I was personally left with abt 100 after paying my other friend. But I can already feel that he’s still bitter about the whole interaction.

AITA?

TL:DR: Cousin got mad that I sold the item that HE gave me and demands money back, we both end up about 50/50

After I left, I went to the pickup site that me and the guy off EBay decided to and sold the whole thing for around $250. After getting the money I ended up paying my friend (who I’d owe $40), my cousin (who I ended up paying $75, about 15 more than I owed him), and got my self a 4for$4 deal from Wendy’s. When I got home I told my cousin that I’d pay him, but then he asked where the rest was, to which I was quite confused. He demanded that I pay him the entirety of the amount that I ended up selling it for and that it was his game system and therefore it’s his money. I rebutted by saying that he’d gave it to ME and I ended up selling it, and that if he really wanted the money he’d had sold it his self. 

After going back and forth for about 10 minutes, we settled that I’d send him another 20 and we’d be good. 
So in the end, I sent him around $95 and I was personally left with abt 100 after paying my other friend. But I can already feel that he’s still bitter about the whole interaction.

AITA?

TL:DR: Cousin got mad that I sold the item that HE gave me and demands money back, we both end up about 50/50

I came home from work today and proudly told my partner that I've lost another pound. I'm trying to lose my last 10-12lbs that hormonal changes in my 30s gave me.

Then he proceeded to tell me that the reason I've gained 12 pounds over the last 5 years is that I'm carrying water weight and that I need to stop eating crap. Meanwhile, I've been super diligent, especially over the last few months about eating high protein, low calorie foods like chicken, fish, tofu, and beans. I've limited my sugar intake to one fancy americano a week, and completely stopped gluten and most dairy. I eat pretty clean and and work out at least 5x/wk.

And I have a friend my whole friend group calls giggles cause she has the most disgusting laugh ever snorts and all but she’s always laughing. She laughs at anything and everything. Back to the party though, we started drinking and talking and cracking jokes and of course she was laughing. It was to the point where she was laughing for about 20 minutes straight and about 5 minutes into her laughing I started recording her because it was a moment we probably wouldn’t remember. Yesterday my girlfriend was looking in my camera roll for some pictures I took of her and she found the video and I didn’t think it was a big deal when she started watching it but when she hit the 5 minute mark and realized that there was more she was pissed she went on about how having a video of another girl that’s that long is “ridiculous, obsessive, and cheater behavior” but I truly don’t think it’s that big of a deal but she’s pissed at me and won’t answer my texts and calls. Am I the asshole?

Before any of this happened though, she had what I can only describe as a fascination of my sister 24F who got engaged last year. She first learned of me having a sister when I showed the engagement photos my sister had given to me. After that, she followed my sister on Insta and other social media apps and liked all (if not, a lot) of her posts. She also went and followed a lot of people who my sister followed which sister and I thought was weird but shrugged off and didn’t think much of after.

After what happened between me and my friend, I confided in my sister since she’s literally my best friend. She was the first person I came out to as bi and even though we’ve had more than our fair share of disputes, we’ve had a lot of great memories and I value her input on everything I do. When I told her what happened, she told me that she never really got a good vibe from my friend, mainly because of how obsessive she seemed over all the posts my sister had been making. I asked my sister to block her on everything and also all other people who helped my friend carry out what she did and my sister agreed.

After sister blocked my friend, I messaged my friend in a group chat and said ‘If you want to disrespect me, you disrespect my sister. Sorry but she’s gonna be blocking you. You weirded her out from the get go anyway.’ I then also blocked her and since then, mutuals of me and my now, ex-friend have told me that she’s began practically drooling and obsessing over a new person, which just proves mine and my sister’s suspicion that she has some weird sort of parasite thing going on. That’s not relevant really but it’s just something I observed. But I have been told that I don’t have a right to control who my ex-friend does or doesn’t follow and that making my sister block her when she was her ‘inspiration’ was vindictive of me. I don’t think it was and I find it hypocritical because what she did to me involved isolating me from all of my friends and turning everyone against me so I think having one person (my literal flesh and blood) turn their back on her is fair game.

154,1e9uu18,AITAH For Making My Mother Depressed?,"My mother (56) is depressed because her sister-in-law (58) said she wouldn’t visit if invited because I (32F) haven’t visited her recently. Despite my mother visiting them frequently and attending all their events, my lack of visits has caused tension.

Preface 1:
My maternal family is culturally close and old-fashioned, sharing all personal matters. My mother’s sister-in-law is dominant in this dynamic, especially since my grandmother lives with her, making their house a central family hub.

Preface 2:
During my adolescence, I was emotionally neglected, belittled by my parents, and bullied by extended family and schoolmates. This led to social anxiety, an eating disorder, chronic depression, and bipolar II disorder, all of which required psychiatric treatment. My home environment was toxic, with constant arguments and poverty. My mother’s belief in prioritizing others’ opinions over my own further damaged my self-esteem.

Over time, I gained confidence through work, improved my health, and developed social skills. Recently, my husband and I moved into a section of the family home we share with my mother and sister. Since then, I hosted my aunt and her family twice and visited them five times. However, after becoming pregnant in February, I struggled with confidence due to weight gain and acne, leading me to isolate myself.

In the months of my absence (March-July), I still made efforts: sending dinners, desserts, and communicating via text. Despite this, my aunt was displeased, and today she told my mother she wouldn’t visit if invited unless I visit her house. My mother visits them multiple times a week and attends all their events. She highly values their opinions, sometimes more than mine or my sister’s. Notably, none of the extended family congratulated me on my pregnancy.

My aunt’s comments upset my mother, who felt she was losing her family and cried, saying that she could die today. She believes my isolation is a problem that needs fixing, even though she knows about my emotional state and past issues, which my husband and I have explained to her multiple times.

155,1e9ukax,AITA - asking my housemate and his girlfriend to whisper at night ,"My housemate’s long distance girlfriend is visiting our country and is living in our small three bedroom house with us for two and a half months. My housemate and I both have rooms on the middle floor and the bottom floor is an open plan living room and kitchen. There is very little noise insulation from the rooms and I can hear everything from my room (particularly in the living room as my bedroom is directly above it) to the point where I can follow along with their conversation when they are talking a lot of the time.

Since she has come to visit, almost every night, the noise has been bothering me. They both talk naturally quite loudly as it is, and often are laughing as well as other things like playing video games, using the kitchen, showering sometimes, all in the evening at 11-2am. 

Even when they are in his room having a normal conversation it bothers me and it’s making it difficult to sleep. I ask them every night to be quiet and i really don’t know what to do because I can’t keep dealing with this noise every night. It’s not like it’s excessive noise like shouting or playing loud music, but because of the house layout, it’s very difficult. 

Is it unreasonable to ask them to whisper when they are awake talking past midnight and to not be using the living room to play video games together at night time? When it was just him it was usually okay, but now it’s both of them it’s starting to really get to me, especially considering she is a guest here and I am paying rent to live here and I’m not able to sleep properly.
