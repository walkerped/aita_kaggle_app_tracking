0,1eb5s66,AITA for planning to move to California for my relationships best interest? ,"My partner (30M) and I (27F) have been dating a year and we really want to get married in a few years when I graduate nursing school in 2026. We want to move to Northen California where one of my friends live in a few years as well.


 I  have lived in Central Texas my whole life and I have a great relationships with my mom and dad and my friends here. I see my mom and dad at least once every 2 weeks. 

Why we want to leave Texas: 

my partner might be trans they are not sure yet, and they want to try hormone therapy, however they don't feel safe doing so in a red state like Texas. They don't want me to share they might be trans with anyone.
My partner works in tech and are very confident they can WFH or find a new job there and I think I can find a nursing job there as well.
My best friend who is also moving to California had to have a abortion under terrible circumstances that I am not allowed to mentioned here and that has also scared me of this state. 
I take birth control for pain and worry that  will be 
Banned

I am left winged and my dad is right winged. My dad is actually trans himself but doesn't want to transition or seek therapy because he is afraid of how others will react. I have the frontier go wild pass (cheap flight pass) and I plan to use it to visit Texas often. I decided I would rather live in California and visit Texas than the other way around. My friends and family are accepting of me planning to move in a few years except for my dad and sister. 

The conflict:

 My dad has been crying telling me I am riping apart our family by moving and that it is selfish for me to go to California. My dad was divorced by my mom and has abandonment issues because his father abandoned him. He keeps texting me telling me how selfish I am and he is literally sobbing, I plan to still call him often and visit often but this is what I want to do with my life right now.
I feel like such a jerk to my dad, AITA for moving away to experience new things and live in a safer place for with my partner?

1,1eazlnf,AITA for possibly breaking my friend's trust?,"Hello, and Iâ€™m a non-binary teenager in high school. My friend (we will call her Gee) recently tried to fix things up with her ex (we will call him Tom). Tom was a gaslighter, and I witnessed him lying myself. He would talk behind her back and lie about never dating her in the first place. He was overall a shitty person. She wanted to have closure with Tom, and when she told me she dmd him I knew it was a horrible idea and it wouldn't end well.

Tom at the time was dating my Kylie's (my friend) bff Amy, and Kylie told me all about how he was controlling and manipulative and controlled Amy. Although I didn't get proof of it, I believed her because she told me this after I opened up to her about how Tom is a red flag. I also found out Tom mentioned Gee to Amy, so they already knew about her. She also told me that Tom has been calling Gee crazy behind her back and saying that she was an asshole ex.

Gee knows how heâ€™s a bad person. But recently, while trying to clear things up with Tom, he explains how Kylieâ€™s friendgroup actually made rumours on him. He said that they created groupchats about him on snap, just so they could talk bad about him, and that they had to complain to the teachers about them. His mother read outloud on call about how they emailed the teachers about how they were harassing him.

He sent screenshots of the groupchats, but unfortunately I never got to read them because it was on snap and they get auto-deleted every 24 hours. Gee then later went to Kylie in insta dms, who was at the time recovering from surgery, and straight up said â€˜I know youâ€™re lyingâ€™. She was aggressive towards Kylie, who was constantly trying to get her to stop dming her because she needed to rest, and she could instead go talk to Tilly, the friend who was called a whore unrightfully.

Tilly then explains everything more in detail. She tells her that heâ€™s been lying about them and that he himself made a groupchat about her, and that she saw it in person. Amy was in that groupchat as well, talking bad about her. But Geeâ€™s still believes Tom, and she's romantically interested in him (again).

Hereâ€™s why I could be the asshole: I went and told Kylie what he said to Gee. Kylie is my friend, and I wanted to give her closure because she deserves to know what has been said about her. But I feel like Iâ€™m breaking Geeâ€™s trust, and that Iâ€™m also involving myself into a situation. Kylie and Gee are both my friends, and I just want to know Kylieâ€™s perspective but also let her know of what he did as well. Idk who to believe at all. So, am I the asshole?

If you have any questions and if anything is unclear, please let me know in the comments! I might have missed some things because of the 3000 character rule.

P.s, If you're wondering why I was being shown DMS, it's because my best friend Gee usually tells me everything and I was also a messenger (sort of) for her and Kylie (I told Gee about the things he said abt her).",POO Mode Activated ðŸ’©,2024-07-24,"AITA for possibly breaking my friend's trust?

2,1eaxoco,UPDATE: AITA for what I (26F) said to my BF (28M) in front of his friends?,"So, a lot of people private messaged me and helped me work through everything regarding my now ex, including being a shoulder to cry on when I realized it wasn't going to work out, and I guess I felt I owed them an update if they were interested. Not to mention the great advice I received in the comments on the original. I am deeply thankful to so many of them, a few in particular who disagreed with my take also helped me see where he may have been coming from and helped me to figure out how I was going to talk to him about everything.

So I did apologize for bringing it up publicly, I know that many people disagreed with me that I should, but personally, I've always been the type to want to handle any grievances I may have with a loved one privately, rather than publicly, and I didn't like that fact that I allowed myself to break that rule, around his friends no less.

He thanked me for that but really didn't want to dig into why he felt the need to make a joke out of it. I asked if it was because I had been bringing her/her music up more than usual, due to her being active in the media currently, but he denied this. Still, I continued to press, explaining that we needed to move past this one way or another because if he continued to mock/ridicule my interests it was going to make me slowly resent him, something I really didn't want, but couldn't deny would happen if he continued to act like a bully.

Eventually, after a lot of pressure, he explained that this had all started because he had complained to his friends privately about me last year, during the lead-up to her album release, and they didn't like the fact that I was a fan of this artist and made some political assumptions about her based on her lyrical content from over ten years ago, teasing boyfriend for having a 'wannabe trad-wife girlfriend' and other things that he was resentful of, including but not limited to asking if I had daddy issues, or if I had a history of sleeping with older men. I am heavily sanitizing the language used, because some of what was said was disgusting, honestly.

Basically, it boiled down to him trying to shame me into not liking the artist anymore so he wouldn't have to deal with his friends anymore, rather than just shutting them down. I couldn't be in a relationship like that, I just couldn't. The fact that every time I had felt awful about myself and my interests for the past year and just thought I was being oversensitive to a joke- it was actually the point to make me feel bad? It destroyed any hope I had for the relationship.

I won't lie, I've been pretty heartbroken. The breakup was shortly after the first post and I've just gotten around to updating, so yeah, no big blowout with dramatics, no secret affair, or anything, just a man trying to make me feel small because he didn't know how to tell his friends to piss off.

I 21m recently figured out that Iâ€™m Bi and have started seeing a guy that lives a couple of hours away from me (not in the us) and itâ€™s going well we have seen each other 7 times the last 2 weeks.  He 24m invited me to his place and offered to pay for my train ticket and even upgraded me to first class. Ngl it feels good to be on the other side and be treated like this.

Here is where the problem start. My trip is booked and Iâ€™ll be going in a week. My friends that I have known since I was 5 wanted to travel with me to a city thatâ€™s 30 min away from the city that week and to make it cheaper they wanted to split the cost. I told them I was already going to be there and I would meet them up some of the days. They asked how I could afford to be in first class and I told them that the guy Iâ€™m seeing offered it to me. They got mad and demanded I get him to refund the ticket so we all can split the cost. 

I told them that they are being entitled to expect me to just cancel a ticket that Iâ€™d been offered just so I could split the cost. They called me an Ah and told me not to bother meeting up with them. To that i said no problems donâ€™t want to be around entitled ahs 

I told my sister about the situation even tho she agrees that they are wrong, I shouldnâ€™t have called them entitled Ahs. And that this isnâ€™t something to throw a long friendships over something so small.

7,1eanhoo,AITA? Unintentionally got a friend and coworker in trouble yesterday.,"I'm pretty jumpy, I've had to deal with PTSD from an abusive upbringing and also have high anxiety. I won't give a direct age but I'm in my late 30s.

It's pretty common for folks to spook me at some point, it isn't hard. I usually laugh it off and tell them it's probably gonna happen again.

So I'm at work yesterday and a coworker and friend (outside of work) spooked me. We had the conversation and I thought that was it. 

Well they then intentionally scared me several times throughout the night, I guess they were trying to test me or something.

The thing is at some point she scared the crap out of me to the point I ended up yelling and throwing my clipboard. It just happened.

I yelled loud enough that my lead in the offices heard and they ended up coming out and yelling at my friend.

Now my friend is pissed off saying I was just overreacting and got them in trouble and that I should be able to control myself better.

I've gotten a lot better (used to wake up screaming at night) but their comment makes me wonder if I need to redouble my efforts with my anxiety.
