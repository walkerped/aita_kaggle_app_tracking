0,1eb5s66,AITA for planning to move to California for my relationships best interest? ,"My partner (30M) and I (27F) have been dating a year and we really want to get married in a few years when I graduate nursing school in 2026. We want to move to Northen California where one of my friends live in a few years as well.


 I  have lived in Central Texas my whole life and I have a great relationships with my mom and dad and my friends here. I see my mom and dad at least once every 2 weeks. 

Why we want to leave Texas: 

my partner might be trans they are not sure yet, and they want to try hormone therapy, however they don't feel safe doing so in a red state like Texas. They don't want me to share they might be trans with anyone.
My partner works in tech and are very confident they can WFH or find a new job there and I think I can find a nursing job there as well.
My best friend who is also moving to California had to have a abortion under terrible circumstances that I am not allowed to mentioned here and that has also scared me of this state. 
I take birth control for pain and worry that  will be 
Banned

I am left winged and my dad is right winged. My dad is actually trans himself but doesn't want to transition or seek therapy because he is afraid of how others will react. I have the frontier go wild pass (cheap flight pass) and I plan to use it to visit Texas often. I decided I would rather live in California and visit Texas than the other way around. My friends and family are accepting of me planning to move in a few years except for my dad and sister. 

The conflict:

 My dad has been crying telling me I am riping apart our family by moving and that it is selfish for me to go to California. My dad was divorced by my mom and has abandonment issues because his father abandoned him. He keeps texting me telling me how selfish I am and he is literally sobbing, I plan to still call him often and visit often but this is what I want to do with my life right now.
I feel like such a jerk to my dad, AITA for moving away to experience new things and live in a safer place for with my partner?

1,1eazlnf,AITA for possibly breaking my friend's trust?,"Hello, and I’m a non-binary teenager in high school. My friend (we will call her Gee) recently tried to fix things up with her ex (we will call him Tom). Tom was a gaslighter, and I witnessed him lying myself. He would talk behind her back and lie about never dating her in the first place. He was overall a shitty person. She wanted to have closure with Tom, and when she told me she dmd him I knew it was a horrible idea and it wouldn't end well.

Tom at the time was dating my Kylie's (my friend) bff Amy, and Kylie told me all about how he was controlling and manipulative and controlled Amy. Although I didn't get proof of it, I believed her because she told me this after I opened up to her about how Tom is a red flag. I also found out Tom mentioned Gee to Amy, so they already knew about her. She also told me that Tom has been calling Gee crazy behind her back and saying that she was an asshole ex.

Gee knows how he’s a bad person. But recently, while trying to clear things up with Tom, he explains how Kylie’s friendgroup actually made rumours on him. He said that they created groupchats about him on snap, just so they could talk bad about him, and that they had to complain to the teachers about them. His mother read outloud on call about how they emailed the teachers about how they were harassing him.

He sent screenshots of the groupchats, but unfortunately I never got to read them because it was on snap and they get auto-deleted every 24 hours. Gee then later went to Kylie in insta dms, who was at the time recovering from surgery, and straight up said ‘I know you’re lying’. She was aggressive towards Kylie, who was constantly trying to get her to stop dming her because she needed to rest, and she could instead go talk to Tilly, the friend who was called a whore unrightfully.

Tilly then explains everything more in detail. She tells her that he’s been lying about them and that he himself made a groupchat about her, and that she saw it in person. Amy was in that groupchat as well, talking bad about her. But Gee’s still believes Tom, and she's romantically interested in him (again).

Here’s why I could be the asshole: I went and told Kylie what he said to Gee. Kylie is my friend, and I wanted to give her closure because she deserves to know what has been said about her. But I feel like I’m breaking Gee’s trust, and that I’m also involving myself into a situation. Kylie and Gee are both my friends, and I just want to know Kylie’s perspective but also let her know of what he did as well. Idk who to believe at all. So, am I the asshole?

If you have any questions and if anything is unclear, please let me know in the comments! I might have missed some things because of the 3000 character rule.

P.s, If you're wondering why I was being shown DMS, it's because my best friend Gee usually tells me everything and I was also a messenger (sort of) for her and Kylie (I told Gee about the things he said abt her).",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-07-24,"AITA for possibly breaking my friend's trust?

2,1eaxoco,UPDATE: AITA for what I (26F) said to my BF (28M) in front of his friends?,"So, a lot of people private messaged me and helped me work through everything regarding my now ex, including being a shoulder to cry on when I realized it wasn't going to work out, and I guess I felt I owed them an update if they were interested. Not to mention the great advice I received in the comments on the original. I am deeply thankful to so many of them, a few in particular who disagreed with my take also helped me see where he may have been coming from and helped me to figure out how I was going to talk to him about everything.

So I did apologize for bringing it up publicly, I know that many people disagreed with me that I should, but personally, I've always been the type to want to handle any grievances I may have with a loved one privately, rather than publicly, and I didn't like that fact that I allowed myself to break that rule, around his friends no less.

He thanked me for that but really didn't want to dig into why he felt the need to make a joke out of it. I asked if it was because I had been bringing her/her music up more than usual, due to her being active in the media currently, but he denied this. Still, I continued to press, explaining that we needed to move past this one way or another because if he continued to mock/ridicule my interests it was going to make me slowly resent him, something I really didn't want, but couldn't deny would happen if he continued to act like a bully.

Eventually, after a lot of pressure, he explained that this had all started because he had complained to his friends privately about me last year, during the lead-up to her album release, and they didn't like the fact that I was a fan of this artist and made some political assumptions about her based on her lyrical content from over ten years ago, teasing boyfriend for having a 'wannabe trad-wife girlfriend' and other things that he was resentful of, including but not limited to asking if I had daddy issues, or if I had a history of sleeping with older men. I am heavily sanitizing the language used, because some of what was said was disgusting, honestly.

Basically, it boiled down to him trying to shame me into not liking the artist anymore so he wouldn't have to deal with his friends anymore, rather than just shutting them down. I couldn't be in a relationship like that, I just couldn't. The fact that every time I had felt awful about myself and my interests for the past year and just thought I was being oversensitive to a joke- it was actually the point to make me feel bad? It destroyed any hope I had for the relationship.

I won't lie, I've been pretty heartbroken. The breakup was shortly after the first post and I've just gotten around to updating, so yeah, no big blowout with dramatics, no secret affair, or anything, just a man trying to make me feel small because he didn't know how to tell his friends to piss off.

I 21m recently figured out that I’m Bi and have started seeing a guy that lives a couple of hours away from me (not in the us) and it’s going well we have seen each other 7 times the last 2 weeks.

Here is where the problem start. My trip is booked and I’ll be going in a week. My friends that I have known since I was 5 wanted to travel with me to a city that’s 30 min away from the city that week and to make it cheaper they wanted to split the cost. I told them I was already going to be there and I would meet them up some of the days. They asked how I could afford to be in first class and I told them that the guy I’m seeing offered it to me. They got mad and demanded I get him to refund the ticket so we all can split the cost. 

I told them that they are being entitled to expect me to just cancel a ticket that I’d been offered just so I could split the cost. They called me an Ah and told me not to bother meeting up with them. To that i said no problems don’t want to be around entitled ahs 

I told my sister about the situation even tho she agrees that they are wrong, I shouldn’t have called them entitled Ahs. And that this isn’t something to throw a long friendships over something so small.

7,1eanhoo,AITA? Unintentionally got a friend and coworker in trouble yesterday.,"I'm pretty jumpy, I've had to deal with PTSD from an abusive upbringing and also have high anxiety. I won't give a direct age but I'm in my late 30s.

It's pretty common for folks to spook me at some point, it isn't hard. I usually laugh it off and tell them it's probably gonna happen again.

So I'm at work yesterday and a coworker and friend (outside of work) spooked me. We had the conversation and I thought that was it. 

Well they then intentionally scared me several times throughout the night, I guess they were trying to test me or something.

The thing is at some point she scared the crap out of me to the point I ended up yelling and throwing my clipboard. It just happened.

I yelled loud enough that my lead in the offices heard and they ended up coming out and yelling at my friend.

Now my friend is pissed off saying I was just overreacting and got them in trouble and that I should be able to control myself better.

I've gotten a lot better (used to wake up screaming at night) but their comment makes me wonder if I need to redouble my efforts with my anxiety.

9,1ebgg09,AITA for how I reacted to my ex’s passing?,"So I, (17m), was in a relationship with my first long term girlfriend from the time i was 13 until I was 16. It was very emotionally dependent and draining relationship. We both had a lot of family issues and struggled with substance abuse. We relied on each other more than we should’ve and it created a very toxic relationship for the both of us. When I turned 16, I got into therapy and was making an effort to get better while my girlfriend, who was 17 at the time, only began getting worse. She made no effort to get better and found comfort in her suffering. Due to this, I broke it off with her after months of trying to help her get sober. It was extremely hard for me. I was incredibly attached to her but I could feel myself being dragged down with how miserable she was. 

Cut to now, a little over a year later. I have a boyfriend, (18m), who I have been with for 3 months now. He knows the bare minimum about my ex since I never like to go into detail, but he does know about my relationship with her. Here’s where I may be the asshole. 

A few weeks ago, I had found out from my ex girlfriend’s mom that she had passed away. She wrote a letter to me saying that I was the love of her life and that she regretted not getting better with me every single day. This destroyed me. I was inconsolable for days. Despite trying my best to move on, she was my first love and I will always have a soft spot for her and everything she did for me. 

During this period, I tried my best to communicate with my boyfriend that I needed space and that I was in the right headspace to talk about it yet. At first, he was very patient and understanding but after a week or two he began to get very upset with me. He said that I was neglecting him and that I shouldn’t be this caught up over an exes death. I got frustrated when he said this and lashed out a bit. Ever since, he’s been saying i’m neglecting him and that he doesn’t want to speak to me until, in his words, “i’m over that bitch”.

So, am I the asshole here for grieving the death of my ex?

Edit: To give some more context, my ex girlfriend was also a childhood friend of mine. This is why her mom contacted me when she passed (since someone asked). We grew up in the same neighborhood and were the only kids around the same age. 

To give more insight into my relationship with my partner, he is aware of that. We have known each other for 9 months. He confessed at the 3 month mark of us knowing each other but I wasn’t ready then. We started dating at about the 6 month mark of us knowing each other. Despite this situation, we never had any previous problems revolving around jealousy and such. He’s always been very understanding of mental and health issues due to my past trauma. He’s one of the main reasons I was able to due so well in therapy, which is why this sort of reaction felt out of character for him. ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-24,"AITA for how I reacted to my ex’s passing? So I, (17m), was in a relationship with my first long term girlfriend from the time i was 13 until I was 16. It was very emotionally dependent and draining relationship. We both had a lot of family issues and struggled with substance abuse. We relied on each other more than we should’ve and it created a very toxic relationship for the both of us. When I turned 16, I got into therapy and was making an effort to get better while my girlfriend, who was 17 at the time, only began getting worse. She made no effort to get better and found comfort in her suffering. Due to this, I broke it off with her after months of trying to help her get sober. It was extremely hard for me. I was incredibly attached to her but I could feel myself being dragged down with how miserable she was. 

Cut to now, a little over a year later. I have a boyfriend, (18m), who I have been with for 3 months now. He knows the bare minimum about my ex since I never like to go into detail, but he does know about my relationship with her. Here’s where I may be the asshole. 

A few weeks ago, I had found out from my ex girlfriend’s mom that she had passed away. She wrote a letter to me saying that I was the love of her life and that she regretted not getting better with me every single day. This destroyed me. I was inconsolable for days. Despite trying my best to move on, she was my first love and I will always have a soft spot for her and everything she did for me.

10,1ebgfa3,AITA for excluding my girlfriend from my birthday celebration because of what she said?,"I (23M) just had my birthday this past Sunday. I celebrated in part by meeting up with my aunt (45F) for brunch. My aunt and I share our birthday and have always spent at least part of the day together. It’s a tradition that’s really important to both of us. 

A couple weeks ago, my girlfriend (23F) said she wanted to throw me a birthday party, especially since now we have enough fun money to spend on something like that. I said that would be great, but it probably couldn’t be on my birthday-day, since I was meeting my aunt for brunch and then had to go into work early the next day, so an evening party would have to end early too. 

We then had a long discussion that turned into an argument over having a celebration on the actual day or not. It became clear that she wanted me to reschedule brunch and that was my line. I told her that time with my aunt on our birthday is more important to me than spending it with anyone else (part of her reason for having it that day was that a few friends would be in town then but not the following weekend). 

I told her part of the reason why it matters, which is that my aunt was a twin and her twin died when they were teenagers. Their birthday was hard for her and then, when I was unexpectedly born on the same day (I was premature), it made the day easier for her to handle. She never put all that on me as a kid, but told me when I was an adult how grateful she was that we were “birthday buddies” and that it had felt like a blessing. My aunt is an amazing lady and I have always loved sharing our birthday. I was even more glad when she told me all of that. 

When I told this all to my girlfriend though, her first reaction was that it was “messed up that your aunt uses you as an emotional crutch and that you’re a grown man who can make his own plans”. I think my feelings must have shown on my face because she tried to backtrack or qualify her statement or whatever, but I wasn’t having it. I told her that there was no need to throw me a birthday party at all. 

What I ended up doing was having the brunch as planned with just me and my aunt, and then my parents had a cookout with a lot of our family there. I didn’t invite my girlfriend and when I explained why, my family was kind of split. They all agreed that what she said wasn’t nice or true, but some thought that it also wasn’t kind to exclude her from my birthday entirely when it had clearly mattered to her. 

She and I have hung out both before and after my birthday and there is a tension there. Part of me wants to address it but I also don’t feel bad about what I did, so I don’t know if bringing it up would do much good. 

AITA?

Editing to clarify some things:

- girlfriend and I started dating last December, so it’s been nearly 8 months

- I didn’t want to write out the very long conversation we had where we tried to make plans around the existing time constraints (the brunch was already planned and we knew what the out of town friends’ schedule would be - that sort of thing) but we did try to consider it from every angle before it became clear to me she wanted me to move the brunch 

- the cookout was planned after I told her that she didn’t need to plan any birthday party for me. Basically, my mom called asking if I had plans and offered to host a cookout that day. My family has cookouts/get togethers at least twice a month, so they’re very lowkey, even if there’s a birthday happening, and also my girlfriend had been to several of the cookouts before, so my family was a little surprised she didn’t come. 

- I appreciate that y’all think our birthday buddy tradition is sweet - it has always meant a lot to me. I do want to make it clear that I’m not just doing it to make her happy - it’s something I also look forward to every year. Growing up, my aunt was the cool aunt that all the cousins wanted to hang out with, and I loved this special thing we did (and don’t worry, she does fun/special things with all my cousins and her own kids now, one of our fun/special things just happens to be our birthday.) She has never treated me like a replacement for her twin and she is in no way the AH in this situation.

12,1ebfwkq,AITA For turning my teenage niece away at the door and telling my sister to wake up because of how my niece treats my own daughter?,"My sister Teresa has a sixteen year old daughter Quinn. “Quinn” and I used to be very close when she was younger, and loved having auntie-niece time together. However, since becoming a teenager, Quinn has become very snarky and sarcastic in a mean way.



I particularly don’t like the way she behaves towards my own daughter Bella (she is six.) Quinn crosses the line. A particular episode of verbal cruelty at a birthday party was when I’d had enough and told Quinn “I don’t want you to come over until you can start being nice to Bella.” Teresa was present when I said this.



We live a short walk away from each other. A few days ago, Quinn arrived and wanted dinner, and I turned her away at the door and told her “I don’t like how you treat my daughter. Unless it is an emergency, you are not welcome over.”



Teresa called me because she said I was a horrible person for turning Quinn away because she is sixteen and my niece was upset.



(Teresa has stopped trying to do anything serious about Quinn’s verbal attitude and has justified it in the past with statements along the lines of “That’s just how some teenagers are,” “It’s a teen thing. Teenagers shouldn’t be treated like young children,” or “Quinn’s almost an adult. It’s not your place to parent her like some child.”



I brought up Teresa’s past words and told her she is correct that Quinn is an adult who doesn’t need to be scolded by me. And I have a right to protect my child from an unkind adult. Quinn is already having issues with the school emailing home or friends making excuses for why they don’t want to see her. And it’s time to Teresa to wake up and do something about her daughter.



Teresa and I have both given our sides to mutual friends and acquaintances, and they are divided. Some are saying that Quinn’s attitude is not okay, but I was wrong to turn her away at the door because she’s still sixteen and my niece.



They said being a teenager and rapidly going from childhood to adulthood is already a rough transition. And according to Teresa, Quinn appears to be having issues at school, and I should try to have more patience with her and see what may be going on outside of home.



Regardless of the reason, I feel I had to set a hard boundary with Quinn’s behavior. It isn’t an easy time, but at sixteen, you still know right from wrong.

13,1ebfi2q,AITA for complaining about the other shift at my work being lazy?,"I started working with a big store recently and my job isn’t independent, we are a crew of more or less 15 people and there is a night shift that takes place before the morning shifts lefts.

Almost EVERY SINGLE DAY the night shift let us stuff to do that they didn’t complete but how some my shift always completes our tasks and theirs.

I got to re do a job they didn’t do correctly and that their manager let’s call her Kyla couldn’t even correct them on so I complained with my co worker.

Apparently the night shift manager heard me complain and my shift had a small talk on team work, I knew quick it was about my comment…

We all have a general boss in both shifts (Sam) and I over heard Kyla clearly talking badly about me with Sam. The same woman who gave us that talk about team work in the morning.

“It’s just a little bit of help she is so over reacting” Kyla said and I gave Sam a side eye so she knew I was listening.

They walked away and the night team manager gave them a talk about the job they performed incorrectly the other day.

Kyla is completely in charge of nights shift performance and it wasn’t just a little help, it’s almost every single day something to pick up after.

Obviously Kyla is miss performing her task as manager and I’m getting shamed for complaining to do others people’s job.

But Kyla can talk crap about me and others with Sam and don’t have any consequences but my whole shift gets a talk on team work. Dang wonder when we are having the talk about managers talking crap about the employees that dare to complain…

The night shift even gets paid more than the morning and seem to not performance well on their job.

One of my coworkers mentioned that they heard Kyla talking crap about a lot of workers and other said that she seemed to be mad at someone.

I said it was me and she things is that one task I had to complete but I said that is almost an daily event and they even get paid more than us and there is no reason for us to do their job for them.

I’m sure I’ll be confronted tomorrow about that comment of them getting paid more.

I feel like Kyla is talking crap about me to every manager and a job I used to like today makes me uncomfortable.

15,1ebepuq,UPDATE: AITA for prioritizing my sister over my girlfriend?,"First of all, thank you for all your comments and opinions. I made sure to read all of them. I also appreciate everyone who offered their condolences for my parents' deaths.

Regarding my sister, physically she is well, but emotionally she is struggling. Some days are better than others. She used to be happy, talkative, and full of energy. Now she is quiet, shy and anxious. The other day, we went out exploring Paris together (with my brother and his girlfriend). She was very happy and laughing, but all this positivity faded the next day. I was considering therapy for her, and now it's a priority. Many of you mentioned therapy in your comments to help her get through her grief and fears, and for that, I thank you. I am now looking for a therapist experienced in such situations.

For those concerned about my sister's life and future, I want to say that a few days ago, we had a family video call. It was with me, my brother, our grandparents, some uncles and aunts, and my father's lawyer. We discussed my father's inheritance. Since my brother and I have good university degrees and careers, we decided to divide everything left to us from our parents 50-25-25 in my sister's favor. Her part will be saved in a bank account until she becomes an adult. Additionally, my family is contributing significantly to my sister's account. So, thankfully my sister's financial future is secured.

Regarding my girlfriend, we met today after work. She started by apologizing on behalf of her friends and sister. She swore that she didn't push them on me. She was emotional and venting to them and they took it upon themselves to harass me. She actually likes my sister and feels sorry that she had to deal with all this loss at such a young age. She thought since I have a big family, I might accept giving them my sister's custody. She is not ready for that responsibility. This time, I listened to her until she finished, acknowledged her worries and demands, but simply I don't agree. I told her that my sister is staying, and will require the majority of my time until she gets used to her new life. That's why it will be unfair for me to stay in a relationship without being able to invest time and effort in it. We broke up in a respectful way, wishing each other the best.

My life has changed drastically. I now have many responsibilities: parenting, disciplining, school... I need to get used to my new ""single parent"" life. Until then, I am not going to enter a new relationship for the sake of myself, my sister, and my future partner",UPDATE,2024-07-24,"UPDATE: AITA for prioritizing my sister over my girlfriend?

So, thankfully my sister's financial future is secured.

Regarding my girlfriend, we met today after work. She started by apologizing on behalf of her friends and sister. She swore that she didn't push them on me. She was emotional and venting to them and they took it upon themselves to harass me. She actually likes my sister and feels sorry that she had to deal with all this loss at such a young age. She thought since I have a big family, I might accept giving them my sister's custody. She is not ready for that responsibility. This time, I listened to her until she finished, acknowledged her worries and demands, but simply I don't agree. I told her that my sister is staying, and will require the majority of my time until she gets used to her new life. That's why it will be unfair for me to stay in a relationship without being able to invest time and effort in it. We broke up in a respectful way, wishing each other the best.

My life has changed drastically. I now have many responsibilities: parenting, disciplining, school... I need to get used to my new ""single parent"" life. Until then, I am not going to enter a new relationship for the sake of myself, my sister, and my future partner",,0.1088409274816513,0,0
16,1ebeiui,AITA For not inviting my dad to my Graduation? ,"So, I (22M) just finished my 3 year studies of Recording, Mixing and Production and I'm graduation this Friday. I received 2 tickets and I could have applied for 3 more tickets if needed, I didn't... 

My mum and Girlfriend will be coming to my graduation, but not my dad for multiple reasons. 

1. The main reason is me and my dad have never had a solid relationship. He always favoured my sister and never had time for me, never did things with just me or took any interest in what I like. After his 2nd affair on my 1st stepmums best friend (yes he got with my step mums best mate while she was dying of cancer), me and my dad had a big argument and I didn't speak to him for 10 months. Fast forward in time and I grew numb to his pathetic ways of showing his fatherhood. 

2. He has shown no effort in being there for me while I have been away studying at university. However, he had no problem helping my sister with her shopping or meeting up with her for a drink when she was at university. I am living further away than she was but even when I'm home he doesn't make the little bit of effort to see me, just one text a week to ask if I'm drinking at the weekend... pathetic. 

3. Him and my mum don't really get on, they're civil with each other but as soon as they're not together it becomes very bitchy and uninteresting to say the least, so I don't want my graduation to be full of awkward silence and forced conversations between me, my mum and my dad. 

My mum is and will always be my biggest supporter, me and my girlfriend have only been together for 1 year but in that 9/10 months I've been away, she has helped me more than my dad has in the last 5 years, so I think she deserves to be there, where as my dad, does not. 

Have I made the right decision or should I have stiffen up my upper lip and invited him? 

Thank you for reading if you made it this far

17,1ebef9u,AITA for calling out my ex’s girlfriend ,"I need some advice on this I figured I’d come here. A little background I(18F) and my now ex (20M) have known each other for a while we started flirting a while back but after that we both ended up in separate relationships not losing touch but not texting as much and not flirting. 
We got out of our relationships around the same time and started talking more. A few months later we started flirting again and eventually he asked me out under the condition we start things slow and a month or so later he asked me to be his gf. A week after that he broke things off saying he wasn’t ready for a relationship(not the truth but that’s a different story). 
here we enter into my dilemma. Three days later he started dating a different girl(hurts but whatever) but a week or so after that I went to target with a friend and I saw him as we were about to leave I said hi and he ignored me as a girl rounded the corner and pulled him away. My friend shot me a weird look and when I caught her up to speed she mentioned how she had saw them walking around a few other isles with her giving me dirty looks. 
So I politely texted him asking that he please tell her not to give me dirty looks cause I didn’t do anything and I find it disrespectful. He blew up telling me not to talk about his girl not everything is about me and that she doesn’t even know who I am. It caught me off guard especially because the texting style wasn’t like his. I let it go and he blocked me. 
My friend reassured me that I didn’t do anything wrong but I keep thinking back on it if I should’ve handled things in a better way. It’s been about two weeks now and I thought how better to handle this than going to strangers on the internet.

18,1ebe6co,AITA for refusing to change my flight,"Flying from the UK to the US next month to visit LDB.

I asked him multiple times to check the dates I planned on visiting worked with him and he said they were fine.

A week later he told me he remembered his entire family had booked a beach vacation the week I visit and they’ll already be at the beach when I land, so LDB said he would wait an extra day at home for me, pick me up, and then we’d drive and meet them the next day. 

Today, LDB told me his family are cutting their trip short by one day, which means by the time we drive 4 hours to see them, we’ll only have two nights and one full day.

Because of this, he asked me if I wanted to change my flight to the morning so we could get to the beach earlier to see his family. The original plan was for me to fly into a major airport and then fly the next day at 2pm and land in his hometown around 4pm.

Bear in mind I land in the US at 7pm the night before and by the time I’ve been through passport control, baggage etc, I won’t be at the hotel until 10pm - which will be 3am for my body clock. The new flight he has suggested the next day is at 6am, meaning I’d be up at 3am to get to the airport for a flight with a layover which lands at 12pm - saving a total of 4 hours.

I said I don’t want to change my flight because it was his error not checking the dates and I don’t want to be a zombie for the first few days of the trip from lack of sleep. I also told him he was only thinking of himself and his needs.

19,1ebe3jv,WIBTA for having my brother walk me down the aisle?,"Getting married in September. Wedding planning has been fairly smooth but I've been having a hard time trying to decide my plans regarding walking down the aisle. I was originally leaning toward nobody walking me down the aisle but I've since changed my mind as I think it's a sweet tradition.

My dad has been in out my life for all my life. Went to prison when I was 1 didn't get out till I was 12. He's been pretty solidly around for the last few years and been has done a really good job being present in mine and my kids lives. But, I'm not sure I want him walking me down the aisle

My mom could be a good option because she's the person who raised me and sacrificed so much for me. However, I don't think this would be something she'd be into as she hates attention being on her and gets very emotional.

Another sweet option I considered was having my son (12) walk with me down the aisle. My mom actually did this, having my older brother walk her down the aisle when she married my ex-stepdad. The thing holding me back from this is that he's still not 100% impressed with me getting married, despite the fact he likes my partner and I already have 2 kids with him.

The thing I'm leaning most towards is having my older brother walk me down the aisle. He and I are close and he's done so much for me over the years. I consider him the epitome of what a good big brother should be. After my son was born he became the main male role figure in his life and went out of his way to be involved in his life and make sure he didn't feel like he was missing out not having a dad around. The main reason I want my brother to walk me down the aisle is that I know how much it's going to mean to him and I think it's a nice way to show him how much I value and love him.

However, I was telling my paternal half-sister my plans to ask my brother to walk me down the aisle she reacted negatively. She basically told me I would be an asshole to do this considering how much effort our dads put into to be in my life and that this would really upset him. I think she's also concerned because he's a few months sober now and she doesn't want any news that's going to rock the boat.

On top of this I'm worried that my younger brothers who I'm also close to are going to be a little upset that I chose our older brother instead of one of them.

20,1ebdrwc,AITA for not cleaning up meals I didn’t even eat?,"I recently moved with my partner (A) to a town closer to his parents (S (mom) + J (dad)), and his sister (P) and her boyfriend (N). Up until recently they have been really nice and welcoming and this weekend his parents planned a camping trip. Despite us offering to help with the cost of the sites they declined and we thanked them several times.

I have celiac disease (no gluten) and have other restrictions so I opted to bring my own meals, snacks, and drinks on the trip while S, J, P + N shared food. We also decided I would serve A, S + J a meal on the last day after P+N had left. 

S, J, P, + N did a bunch of cooking throughout the entire trip and had many parts to their meals as they hadn’t prepped anything.
I on the other hand, did a TON of prep before, maybe 30 hours total and didn’t have any prep or clean up during the trip. 

So with this in mind, when time came for them to clean up from their meals, I spent 2 min cleaning mine and then hung out while they spent 15-20 mins.
I thought this made sense since they had their own food and gluten gives me rashes.

Sunday was weird in which I spent the day vomiting and P+N decided to stay for dinner Sunday. I had only made enough for 4 large portions so I said we’d need to supplement with salads. S and P got WEIRD about this and didn’t have any of my dinner. made 24 hot dogs and kept talking about how they had to cook so much food because I didn’t make enough. J, N, A and I had dinner I made and then I got nauseous and left to get sick. I was also hurt at the way S and P were acting so took this time to hang out in the woods for ~20 mins to get out of my head but texted A that I would do the dishes when I got back. A offered to do them for me as he hadn’t done prep leading up so I accepted.

When full camp clean up came I unhooked and tied up ropes, loaded stuff into cars, did a dumpster run, etc. so I helped quite a bit with the after math of the camp itself that wasn’t food related.

When we were leaving S was saying bye and was extremely cold towards me. I didn’t understand why so when we got back from camping I sent a message that said “hey thanks again for the camping trip, sorry I was so sick yesterday” she responded that she didn’t believe I was sick. 

S then called A and said that by not helping prep and clean up from things and only thanking them when the site came up, I was ungrateful, not helpful and lazy. She cited that I had some bottled water, used some paper towel, and had some candy in addition to her providing the site and so as a thank you I should have contributed to the meals. A told her that was ridiculous and one quality about me is how helpful I try to be, so he’s with me here.
I ended up sending her my full 1/6th of the total cost, plus an extra $50 for candy, water and paper towel and then her response was “it’s not about the money” but I no longer want to accept any offers at face value.

So me (31 M) and my best friend (31 F) been going through a real rough time. We have been friends for over 11 years, she been with me in good/rough times.

Except that my best friend, let's call her M been real unlucky in the dating department. She's quite a conservative person by nature, never the partying type and not very welcoming of socializing with whatever man she gets to talk with. She knows herself too well and never compromises herself despite being little depressed from the lack of men in her life. While me, quite the opposite of her, had my fair share of women in my life, which she finds very interesting that I had that much women. I am also currently engaged to a very beautiful petite and kind lady.

So a lot of the time it is me supporting her during her rough times of being single, even offered being her wingman which she hesitantly agreed to cause she's very embarrassed about it and I believe it became a very complex subject to her that created a huge insecurity. She's quite pretty actually and do get attention from men, just not her type of men. She's a bookworm and your casual joe doesn't really interest her. I wouldn't say her standards are high, but given that she's an academic with a PhD in some complicated chemical field somehow made her dating pool chances limited to men in the same academic field which hasn't yielded great results.

So here comes me, we were talking about men and she said something like ""men are useless"" (which imo, she's becoming little bitter towards men, but I never told her that, except that day) where I replied to her jokingly saying ""hold your horses there, aren't you becoming little bitter towards men for being single lol"". And trust me, I was 100% joking, I never saw it coming that it would break her.

Shit went south. She cried. And I stood there freezed not knowing what the hell should I do. It wasn't the first time that I teased her that way, but I guess I picked the wrong day and misread the situation and chose the wrong moment to tease her about it. Now it's been like a month since this happened. She turned completely cold towards me, it's been a whole month of us going back and forth about it every once in a while, she thinks she finally figured my true face and how I really think ofher as just a bitter aging lonely woman and that she can never trust me ever again.

Of course, I had my outburst in response to her outburst, told her she is just projecting her own insecurity at me and that this is really not the truth at all. Obviously this made things even worse. 

I offered distance, that we shouldn't talk till things cooldown, but she refused it, she wants us to be in contact (While she acts completely cold towards me) and that I shouldn't decide how things take shape cause she's the one whose completely hurt. But I think it's her way of getting over me, by not cutting contact she can slowly get used to the distance and eventually let it die.

22,1ebdoo6,AITA for wanting to go back overseas after my mom had a stroke?,"My (32M) mother (62F) had a stroke on May 24th. I flew back to the US from Europe the next day and have since then: spent every day in the hospital and rehabilitation clinic until she went home, fixed their insurance (it updates on Aug 1st), learned all the rehabilitation exercises for her, helped organize a few caretakers (family friends as well as new folks from online) set a schedule for meds, food, exercising, bought equipment, etc., set everything up for my parents. My dad is 81 and still works at the office/warehouse my parents co-ran, but is trying to hand it off to a friend of his as soon as possible. He works 6-8 hours a day, and I watch my mom for \~12 hours a day right now, from 7-7ish, which was very difficult to juggle being caretaker (food, meds, exercises, bathroom) and case-worker as I navigated insurance, PT/OT, and potential caretakers for weeks. This has taken a pretty hard toll on me mentally, but I have things set up to where we can have a caretaker at my parent's house 4 or even 6 hours a weekday if need be (my mom doesn't want us to hire caretakers, and is pretty adamant against it, but I'm looking into it regardless).

I recently started therapy and have been really digging into how much I don't have a great relationship with my parents. This goes past the scope of this subreddit, but needless to say, staying here for much longer while I do this is not what I want/need. I'm trying to find a new job in my city and start up a new masters, and I need to take a german course to brush up on that before I do (courses start end of September). I told my dad today I plan on leaving August 6th, to which he understood how I felt but would much prefer I stay til the end of August, citing how hard it's been on him as well, which I understand - but I feel like this has all been placed on me as my personal responsibility (as the only child...) and I'm conflicted and torn between staying and going. I told my mom (as gently as I could) that it just felt like a lot of responsibility for one person, and she said that was what you do for family, and started crying.

If I was very close to my parents, it would be a different story, but I'm not.

My (32M) mother (62F) had a stroke on May 24th. I flew back to the US from Europe the next day and have since then: spent every day in the hospital and rehabilitation clinic until she went home, fixed their insurance (it updates on Aug 1st), learned all the rehabilitation exercises for her, helped organize a few caretakers (family friends as well as new folks from online) set a schedule for meds, food, exercising, bought equipment, etc., set everything up for my parents. My dad is 81 and still works at the office/warehouse my parents co-ran, but is trying to hand it off to a friend of his as soon as possible. He works 6-8 hours a day, and I watch my mom for \~12 hours a day right now, from 7-7ish, which was very difficult to juggle being caretaker (food, meds, exercises, bathroom) and case-worker as I navigated insurance, PT/OT, and potential caretakers for weeks. This has taken a pretty hard toll on me mentally, but I have things set up to where we can have a caretaker at my parent's house 4 or even 6 hours a weekday if need be (my mom doesn't want us to hire caretakers, and is pretty adamant against it, but I'm looking into it regardless).

23,1ebch0q,AITA For telling people I don’t want to watch their kids over my summer break?,"
I (17F) am on my last summer vacation before I turn into a senior and have to go to college. The entire time I have been home I’ve had to watch over 5 kids AT THE SAME TIME. I will say three of those kids are my siblings, Lex (13F), Landon (4M), and Oli (2F). And I don’t blame my parents for making me watch them since they both work during the day and stuff. Lex also helps with watching kids too. But the other two kids belong to two different Aunts of mine. Personally I never agreed to watching them. The two other kids are Mel (8F) and Ben (4M). Ben’s mom is my dad’s sister and when she came over one time she said exactly this, “So Ben is going to come everyday and his dad will pick him up later”. She didn’t even ask if he could?? She just went ahead and established it. My mom knows too but my aunt kept telling her that she used to take me and Lex to classes years ago so my mom thinks this is just returning a favor, which wouldn’t that mean my mom needs to return the favor?? But than for Mel her mom is my moms sister (bit of a patten here), Mel’s mom would usually ask Lex if she could stay and she would say yes for some reason and sometimes i wouldn’t mind but Mel has a big problem with my brother for some reason, always having an attitude and being rude to him. With me having mental issues I get really mad at times and I end up lashing at her about it but my mom says I need to stop that and that she only a little girl who doesn’t know better. So I had to be fine with her, but then her mom just started leaving her without telling anyone and that kinda made me pissed. But anyways I really want to tell them to find a babysitter or something because one day I had to go to the DMV with my mom but my Aunts did not care and left them with my 13 year old sister alone at the house, she still a child too?? I told my mom that I’m tired of watching kids but she told me that i better not say anything to my aunts because my parents do agree we shouldn’t be watching this many kids by ourselves. What do you guys think am I being TA or should I say something? BTW we are not getting paid at all.

(Update+more info)-For the people that have been saying I need to get a job, I’m currently applying for a job at a panda express and will get the call pretty soon if I get it or not, both my parents have been suggesting I should get one. Also I do want to say for the people that think I don’t want to watch my siblings is completely false. My parents provide food, a house, and everything I need so the least I could do was to help with THEIR kids. What I’m upset about were the extras, I love my cousins but sometimes I need a break every once in a while. Please don’t say my parents are the bad guys. Both my parents think it’s wrong that their sisters are dropping their kids off to us but they don’t want us to say anything because my aunts have had a hard time in past ig so this is just something nice we should do for them.

24,1ebcgaz,AITA for being a bad friend?,"AITAH for thinking my friend is a little dramatic at times?

I (17f) go to high school with a friend who I met in middle school. Since I’ve met her, I’ve know she was a little more extroverted than I was. Violet (not her real name) (17f) talked to a lot more people, did more extra curricular, and was an AP student besides in English. I helped her with all her science work and other classes, such as English, history, and any other thing we were in together.

After she joined theatre with me, my friend group immediately took her in, and we’ve been friends since. Recently, we both moved schools and lost touch with the rest of the groups besides the few friends I keep in contact with. In the past two years, she’s dropped most of her girl friends to hang out with the guys, gotten more involved with school activities, and started complaining about every little assignment she has to do.

I still send her my answers for the classes we have in common, and she saves everything I’ll do for next year since she’s ahead of me in math. But after I send her answers, she stops talking to me for a bit and complains about everything and anything. Today in class, she started crying about her mom. As someone who is currently having issues with my mom, I tried my best to comfort her because I know it feels to be left alone with no one to talk to, but I felt wrong about asking her what it was about.

But she told me that her mom was making her get her nails done for prom. She told me her mom had said she would like them different than what she had on, which was a light purple shade. Her mom offered to pay, but since it was important, she would like her to have a color that matched her dress. Violet was sobbing, cursing, and just spitting words about her mom because she was being cruel and disrespectful about what she wanted.

I was at a loss of words, considering my own mom had just threatened to kick me out of the house because I wanted to leave for college as soon as I graduated. But I kept my cool, because I just wasn’t sure what to say. I pay my own bills, car insurance, car payment, phone bill, lunch, gas, and a little bit of electricity to keep my door closed, and my friend was upset her mom wanted her to have different nails for prom in two months.

Violet immediately calmed down when her group of friends came by and she tried to play it off as “hormones and her period”, and I left it as that. I moved back to my desk after giving her a piece of chocolate and continued with my work. I feel like an asshole for thinking she was being dramatic, but I know we have different lives. She’s very materialistic and active, while I typically keep to myself and do smaller activities without any interaction with anyone.

But at the same time, I feel things could’ve been handled differently.

Am I the asshole or a bad friend?

EDIT: this has happened multiple times, such as not getting a role, position in volleyball, or friends not listening to what she wants to say. ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-24,"AITA for being a bad friend? AITAH for thinking my friend is a little dramatic at times?

25,1ebcgab,AITA for constantly disappointing my friend?,"I need an outside perspective on this, so please be honest. Me and my friend have been friends for years. At the beginning of our friendship, I had no extra curricular activities so I would call her almost every day for hours. We would mostly play Roblox or talk about shows or stuff because we met when we were like 12. I started to pick up country as well as track and I became really busy. It was slow, but over the years I started filling my time with doing stuff that was actually meaningful. Her, on the other hand, having no extra curricular activities would (request) to call me every day. I would constantly turn her down because I was busy and I didn’t find any interest in staying on the phone with her(or anyone) for hours anymore. I think it’s very important for the story that I mention I TRIED to talk to her, but she NEVER texted me back or invited me anywhere in person. She acted as though texting literally didn’t exist and we couldn’t talk unless we called. If we ever had a conversation, she would always bring up if I could call. And when I did call her and I said I was tired or didn’t want to talk anymore, she would be like “Just 30 more minutes!” At first I didn’t mind that much, but I started to get really annoyed she didn’t except that I have other things to do. 

I have literally never had this problem with anyone else ever. I thought after a while she’d take the hint I just didn’t want to call someone and 
especially to play a game I haven’t wanted to play for YEARS. Sometimes, she won’t ask to call me for 2 months, but she won’t text me at all in those 2 months either. Yesterday, she made a joke about me in front of all my friends saying “ [My name] is so busy, she always says she’ll do things and then doesn’t.” which annoyed me because 1. If she as a problem with it why doesn’t she have a conversation with me and 2. If you want to talk to me text me but I’m not going to call you for hours everyday. But, I thought that I might be being a bad friend because she’s putting all this effort in to call and I keep turning down all her offers pretty much 8/10 times she asks me.

 I sent her a big paragraph talking about how “I’m sorry if I haven’t been spending time with her” and that “I’d like to talk to you more but there’s just a lot going on right now” and that “I would understand if she was upset but that I’m thankful she is understanding.” And then I sent another message saying “Hopefully we can talk more soon” to which she responded “yay”. Now, I might be totally wrong but I was even more annoyed that she had so much to say earlier today, but now when I talk to her all I get is 3 letters??? I was trying to apologize for disappointing her at times and bring up the issue in a mature way so she could bring up her concerns and we could talk about it. A few hours later she sent my a meme that said “that one friend who is always ‘to busy’” which confused me because earlier she said nothing. So am I the a-hole?

26,1ebcdn2,AITA if I reach out to my ex best friend after months of not talking?,"Hi! Looking for some insight on a situation I’ve run into. I had a best friend of over 2 years who abruptly cut contact with over seemingly no reason. 

We were incredibly close and talked to each other every single day. We had a few problems since we both met at bad times in our life, but nothing I ever thought would end our friendship. At the time of our friendship, I was in and out of an incredibly emotionally abusive relationship. Due to this, I heavily relied on my best friend. They were also going through some hard times (won’t disclose) and I thought how close we were brought comfort to each other. 

We would often talk about future together and things we wanted to do with one another. We were so close a lot of our friends even speculated we were dating. We both were actively trying to get better mentally, and I thought things were going well. Here’s where things went wrong:

Over 6 months ago, they had randomly stopped messaging me. I sent multiple messages over different days asking for some kind of reply. I knew everything was okay because they would still post on their instagram story. I thought this was weird and I didn’t understand what had happened. From what I recall, we had no argument the few days prior. Then after days of me messaging, they blocked me on seemingly everything. I took this as a sign of them of them not wanting to talk to me again and made no attempt to contact them unless they contacted me first. I would constantly read over my our messages to the point it began negatively affecting me mentally. My therapist advised me to delete all messages with them and move on, which is what I attempted to do. I still missed them and thought about them often but I didn’t obsess over what happened the way I used to. Until recently. 

A few days ago I was on the old instagram account I used to use when I was friends with them (I switched to a private account with only close friends to step away from social media). During this, I came across a post of theirs on my feed. This confused me because from what I knew, I was blocked. I don’t know what came over me or why I did it but I liked the post. I thought nothing of it and tried to continue my day. Later that day, I checked my story views and saw that their sibling (who I knew) and two of their friends had viewed my story. The only person from this lineup who followed was their sibling so the other two didn’t make sense. After this, I tried following my ex friend to which I got no interaction. 

Here’s where I might be the asshole. I want to reach out to them. My therapist has seen how I obsess over this and says if it could bring me closure in any way I should do it.

30,1ebc50d,AITA for arguing with my mother for not standing up for me?,"I (16F) live in the southeast side of America with my parents. We moved here about an year ago.

Anyways for the first time, my grandparents decided to visit us (they live in the west side).

They came, and it was fun.

During a conversation though, my grandfather kept on complimenting me on how smart I was. It was all fine up until that point. But then he kept on saying how I should be a doctor. I just brushed it off since that’s what old people say. But I still told him how my dream job was to become a lawyer. I was taking after-schools classes and electives related to it. It all started when I joined the debate club when I was in sixth grade and completely became obsessed with researching and debating against others, hearing their arguments, objecting with mine, etc. 

But then my grandfather laughed right at my face and told me how lawyers were all scammers. How all they did was steal money from people and that only idiots became lawyers. He also mentioned how all lawyers eventually end up broke and that if I became one, I’ll be crawling back to HIM and will beg him for money. Basically that I’ll regret it all and waste my life for nothing. So he talked bad for another 5 solid minutes until he switched the conversation back to doctors and how successful I’ll be with a “brain like mine.” He acted as if he didn’t just insult the dream job I had been preparing for almost five years of my life.

Honestly, I was so pissed that I couldn’t even say anything.

But what pissed me off even more was the fact that my mother did absolutely nothing about it. In fact, she nodded along with my grandfather and agreed with him. Mind you, she has always been supportive of my decisions. 

So I stomped back into my room in pure anger.

Later when they all returned to their individual rooms, I argued with my mother on what she did. Just sitting there and not even bothering to defend me. I also told her the next time if he were to ever bring it up again, she WERE to defend me when I argued against him (which I will).

31,1ebc1i2,AITA for telling my roommate I'm moving out early,"My roommate (23F) and I (23F) were classic childhood friends. Over one summer, my roommate (We were both 11) moved to another state with her family. We ended up following each other on social media but didn’t talk much after that. We both ended up at the same college. We were never close but would hangout on occasion. After we graduated college, I was living with my best friend and was considering moving. My roommate texted me asking if I was moving back to my hometown because she needed a roommate. I decided to move in with her at the end of August last year.

We became pretty close once we moved in and spent a lot of time together. I struggling with finding a job post-grad and worked a various jobs for around 8 months to pay my bills. This issue left me feeling depressed and lost in life. I told my roommate once before that I was considering moving back in with my parents because I was struggling to pay my rent each month. She was understanding, but tried to say she was also struggling with money. It felt unfair since she works a salaried job and I was busting tables every night for tips.

Fortunately, I ended up landing a job in April, but since it was entry-level, the pay still wasn’t great. After many nights of tears towards my living situation, I decided it would be best for me to move back in with my parents and then move-in with my boyfriend. We were already planning on living together once my lease was up.

I texted my roommate to let her know I was planning on moving out to live with my parents, and I’d really like to talk more about it in person. She replied hours later and said that it sucks but she understands. I texted back saying I really care a lot about her and don’t want this to ruin our friendship. We had plans that weekend so I asked if she still wanted to hangout.

*Radio silence.*

I texted again if we could talk in person and she finally replied with a huge paragraph about how she felt I was inconsiderate of her feelings for telling her twice now that I’m going to move out. She said she has a history of getting trapped with bad roommates. She understands money is the issue, but she’s really worried about someone new coming in. She made excuses for not having time to talk and cancelled our weekend plans to hangout with someone else. I was really hurt by her reaction. I asked again when she can talk in person.

The tension in the apartment only got worse because she refused to speak to me. I texted an apology because she would immediately go to her room to avoid me after work. After that, she stopped texting me updates about her day, we stopped hanging out on the weekends, we stopped planning trips together; basically our whole friendship felt like it was over.

Ever since that one text, she’s been treating me like I’m a disposable person. I feel used by her and like she was only friends with me because I was convenient.

32,1ebbv03,AITA for refusing to go to a Wedding because my mum wants to control what I am wearing?,"My cousin is getting married and despite them knowing that for over a year they have only just (the wedding is on the 3rd of August) given my mum an invite. They invited my mum and my sister, but not me. However, my sister isn't around, and my mum asked if I could/would come instead since I was already planing to visit home. They and I said yes. So I ordered a few dresses on ASOS because I didn't have much time and found one that fits perfectly, is very cute and perfect for the wedding. I send some pictures to some friends, my sister and my mum.

Everyone complimented it and loved the dress except my mum, who completely lost her shit! She said all of the dresses look awful, they are disgusting and whatnot. They are pretty standard dresses, and the reaction is not justified at all, at the same time, I was hurt because I liked some of them and immediately have lost all interest in the wedding. She started sending me mad ugly dresses that I would never wear which I found insulting. I am 31 YEARS OLD(!!!) I am should be able to wear what I want?

Based on that reaction, I told her that I didn't want to come anymore, I wasn't super interested in the first place and would have only come to accompany her but now I didn't feel like doing that anymore. I also had other reason which I shared with her:

- I am broke, so spending money unexpectedly on transport, clothes (that only she likes and I will never wear again), and cash as a wedding present isn't working for me. I am having a tough year and can barely pay my rent and bills.

- I am the only cousin/younger person there. None of the other cousins are invited, even though the pride is much closer to them. I haven't spoken to her in the last twenty years, and it's kind of strange that I should come and give her money. 

- I am visiting them from a different country and have already booked my flight tickets with hand luggage only before the invite. I refuse to pay an extra £130 to bring a dress, shoes, etc. for one day.

  
And just to be clear, this is not a very glamorous wedding, so what I am wearing isn't even such a big deal, but my mum just needs to control me until she gets whatever she wants and I am sick of it. I should be allowed to wear whatever I want and feel comfortable. I am not even talking about some crazy outfit choice it is a lovely red dress.  

Anyway, we have been fighting for three days now, and she keeps sending me ugly ass dresses and refuses to accept that I do not want to come anymore. I am supposed to visit and stay with her for the next three weeks, and she completely ignores my feelings or the fact that I won't play this fucking game. She now got my sister involved and asked her to bring all her dresses before she leaves so I got something to wear. We aren't even the same size and don't have the same style. I keep telling her I am not going, and she is still trying to force me. Any suggestions also welcome thanks!

They had given accidental clues and stuff before that so we had a pretty good clue as to what was happening. The day they told us me and my brother didnt take it well he cried alot and i went to a friends house and cried there. Time skip about a week my father started hanging out with my moms best friend(35f) alot more then he usually did in that past week which was a little suspicious but i didnt do anything about it. My mom and her best friend were selling things at our towns rib fest

Saturday went fine nothing was out of the usual that night but when i woke up on sunday the calender was torn of the wall and when i asked my father about it he said “me and your moms best friend are no longer friends” i thought he was joking since he made jokes like that all the time so i shrugged it off and went about my day. I had made plans with my friend to go to the ribfest and when we got there i said hi to my mom and her friend but when i saw her friend she told me she wasnt coming over anymore almost guiltily which again wasnt weird as shes going through her own problems with marriage so again i shrugged it off and went home and my dad was pretty angry with something so i asked him what he was so angry about and he said he had cheated on my mother with her best friend and thats when it all clicked for me all the signs and stuff that were shown. I said “that checks” and went off to play video games with my friend, my father came to check on me and i was giving him short answers like “ok” and “yea” and i wasnt in the mood to talk with him. 

The next day he had work which was fine i went about my day normally but when he got home my mood changed and i was glaring and ignoring him and giving short answers yet again. And the same the next day so i sent him a text last night about how i dont wanna talk to him and that i still love him cause hes my dad but what he did was kinda a bad move on his part and that ill need a week or so to collect my thoughts about him and probably forgive him.

35,1ebbc8t,AITA for trying to get my boyfriend to eat more age appropriate food?,"My bf “John” has always had childish taste in food. On our first date, he took me to a 5-star restaurant and ordered spaghetti with red sauce off of the kids’ menu. I didn’t think much of it–in fact, I found it endearing at first–but now that we’re moved in together it bothers me. Every time we go out, it’s mac and cheese, grilled cheese, fruit cup, etc. My job requires me to attend a lot of dinners, and I’ve sometimes brought my sister instead of John as my plus one because my co-workers laugh at his eating habits. The waiters at our favorite restaurant know to bring out a kids’ menu, which is really embarrassing.

John is an all-around great guy. He’s smart, funny, active, good-looking, and good with kids. He has a good job that pays well, and he’s financially responsible. You’d think he would be unhealthy due to his eating habits, but he’s actually quite fit and strong (though tbh he would look best if he lost a few pounds). Because of these things I’ve been willing to look past the eating habits, but recently inspiration struck.

John was away on business for a few days. My job requires more travel than his, so usually if one of us is away, it’s me. This is the first time it was just me in the apartment, so I took it upon myself to throw away all of the childish food. I threw away his frozen chicken tenders,  boxed mac and cheese, peanut butter, jelly, white bread, all the normal staples in his diet. I threw away no more than $50 worth of food (generous estimate) and I bought him $200 worth of high quality food. The day he got home, I cooked a healthy, balanced, ADULT meal for him, complete with an appetizer, an entree, a side, and a dessert. I figured he would be a bit upset about his food being gone, so I wanted to show him how wonderful it was to eat like an adult.

When John got home yesterday, he thanked me profusely for cooking the meal and tried everything I made. He thanked me again and told me he would try to get used to it more, but he had to take baby steps and wanted one of his “safe” foods–a PB&J. When saw the ingredients for it were gone, he asked me if I knew what happened to them. I told him the truth, thinking he would understand, but he was really upset. He said I had no right to tell him what he could and couldn’t eat, and that I betrayed his trust by throwing away all of his food. I tried to reason with him, but he said he needed time away from me. He was nice enough to let me stay in the apartment (it’s in his name), but he packed a suitcase and went to stay with his parents. He has since not responded to any of my texts/calls since he left. 

I’m wondering if the people of Reddit think I’m in the wrong. Did John overreact or do I need to apologize right away?

37,1ebbbeu,AITA for asking to change the date of a New York trip I had suggested separately because my friend has taken over and turned it into her birthday trip?,"My friend and I were planning fun summer activities. I suggested a day trip to New York, with tourist attractions in mind. Later, my friend decided she wanted to do the trip on her birthday. She's incredibly indecisive and has changed her mind multiple times as to what she wants to do for her birthday, therefore, I worry that she'll change her mind and I won't get to go to New York at all. 

I think it's unfair that she's turning the trip that was my idea into her birthday trip. I'm worried I'll have to take a 3 hour train journey all the way to New York, only to do things she wants to do because it's her birthday. Despite the idea of a New York trip being mine in the first place. 

She wants to do an activity that only she likes that will take up almost 2 hours. She's saying it's unfair if we don't do it because it's her birthday. I don't want her to spend the whole trip dictating what we do because it's ""her birthday and so she gets to decide"". 

Additionally, her birthday is on a Sunday so everything opens later and closes earlier. I suggested going in the week to get a longer day but she said it wouldn't be on her birthday then and won't budge.

I originally just wanted it to be a short day trip that we don't have to extensively prep for or take massive suitcases and get super stressed. 

Am I the asshole or is it unfair that she's turned the original trip into her birthday event?

39,1ebb2y6,AITA: I told my roommate I won't take care of her dog,"I (25 F) have one dog. When I got into a relationship and would visit my new boyfriend I would bring my dog back and forth with me. I did not leave it home with my roommate (Kim) to take care of when I did this ever. This was a personal decision of mine as I feel he is my responsibility so if I am able to take him I will. I would only ask her to take care of my dog when I would be physically out of town unable to care for him/ bring him with me, and if she couldn't, I would find another way. But she usually did.

A couple months ago, she got a boyfriend (Jerry) and a new puppy. Jerry has a dog of his own and a roommate as well. We have all (my bf, me, Kim, and Jerry) been on multiple outings together with all of the dogs. They get along great.

Well, Kim started to leave her new dog home with me and my boyfriend (who has moved in at this point). At first we did not mind taking care of her pup. We would let it play with our dog and feed it when she wasn't home. After about a month of this she stopped giving us a heads up that she wouldn't be home, expecting us to care for her new pup. She would also spend most days at her boyfriends house without taking her dog with her. Sometimes it would come around 9:00pm and we would go ahead and feed the dog then she would come home. Every once in a while she will bring her pup with her to Jerry's, but usually she won't. Her pup would chew things up, among other annoying puppy things. Her pup is also quite skittish around people, and in my opinion, it is because it does not get any attention. We bring our dog out and about with us often and are out of the house a lot. Kim's pup stays in its cage most of the time unless Kim is home or we are home at night. She will even leave it in the cage sometimes when she is home. I feel terrible about this but it shouldn't be my responsibility to take care of this dog that isn't mine.

I told her that if she is in town she needs to care for her own dog, or get rid of it because we will no longer take care of it if she is in town. (We understand dog sitting if she is out of town or on a trip).

40,1ebb27g,AITA for telling my friend I'll bring someone else to a concert,"Background info: We have been friends since preschool, so basically our whole lives. She bails on plans a lot because of her children/fiance and she is constantly late if she does make it. 



I saw there was a concert in town that I thought my friend and I would like to go to. We are moms and we rarely get a night out together, especially without our children. I used to work at the venue, so an old coworker was able to get me free tickets. AWESOME.  
  
So I ask my friend about a month before the concert, so she has time to plan, since she has kids and a fiance. She says she can go, she is going to have her fiance's mom watch the kids and her fiance would drive us so we could drink and not worry about driving.

Ok great. 

Well her fiance's mom has plans the following day, and didn't know that we would be home so late (because my friend told her it would only be about 2 hours) Her fiance's mom said she would still watch them but it would need to be at her house instead of theirs. Well here's where the whole plan blows up. Her kids don't want to stay at grandma's house, they are ""scared"". These children sleep in bed with their parents and are 5 and 7.  I won't even get into all my issues with that............  
  
All that aside, I said ""this can be solved if your fiance just stays home with the kids."" My husband is watching our daughter... so seems like a normal solution.  
She said ""no, he doesn't want me to go alone"".... red flag much? He won't let her go out with her best friend to a concert, unless he drives us?? So to her, that wasn't an option and wasn't providing any other solutions she just was being wishy-washy.   
  
So instead of argue about it anymore, I said I'll just invite someone else and that I was disappointed because I wanted to go with her, not my other friend. It seemed like she never wanted to go and that she was just coming up with excuses. So I said ""in the future, I may not ask you first, since it seems like you have a hard time following through with plans, even when given ample time to prepare.""  
  
Now shes mad at me and says I don't put effort into our relationship. Huh??? I feel like I'm being gaslit.

She immediately got angry and called me a bitch and said I was fat and lazy and she needs the cart because she has trouble/pain walking. I tried to ignored her and reverse but she got in front of my cart and continued to berate me.

I heard her go to an employee and start calling me more names pointing and complaining about me not letting her have it and that i’m “abusing the carts” and they’re for people who really need them.

I’m 8 months pregnant as i’ve gotten further along in pregnancy not only has it been painful to stand/walk long distances i’ve also on multiple occasions started to feel very faint as if i’m going to pass out, getting dizzy, sweating profusely,etc. I’ve been checked out by my doctor she says sometimes it just happens and it’s just an unfortunate symptom some women get in pregnancy and is possibly because of blood volume levels, low iron, or sudden blood pressure decreases. I do need those cart just as much as the elderly woman does unless I want to risk myself and my child’s safety by passing out.

43,1ebb0wg,AITA for bringing up something small my dad did a long time ago to defend my little sister?,"Okay so I (19M) and my dad (54) side of the family were recently on the phone (They’re in Florida, I couldn’t go because my grandfather on my mom’s side died unexpectedly and I had to go to the funeral) and my littlest half sister who’s around 7, we’ll call her S, was upset because they wouldn’t play her version of hide and seek. She’s rather heavy and therefore kinda slow, and so she wanted to play a version of hide and seek where if the seeker catches you, you become a seeker and help them, so she can catch people easier and can still be involved if you get caught, which is what they do at their school. Instead they were playing a version where if you get tagged you just go to an area and wait out until the hider or seeker wins (Said area is also base), and she can’t really catch anyone that way without help. My dad was laughing and acting like her version was stupid. 


Years ago I had basically ran into the same problem. I was a big kid and therefore a lot slower than most other people, like my cousins and  siblings. We would play hide and seek a LOT (Basically any time we went somewhere that was big and fairly empty), and they would play the version where if you get caught you just go to the base and wait. So if I was the seeker I would basically never win (I only won once) and if I was the hider I was usually the first guy to get caught. For the record I don’t really have fun when I’m playing a game and losing over and over, it usually kills my mood. So one day I tried bringing up playing my version of hide and seek, so that way I actually had a chance at winning. My dad and former stepmom (I should mention my dad divorced her a while back, now has a new wife that I’m rather close with) for some reason acted like my game was stupid and laughed it off, though my dad made a “compromise” with me where we 
could play my version sometime. However they never did, and when I would bring it up my dad would say “Remember the compromise.” And tell me to play their version. It really bothered me when I was younger but as I grew up I didn’t mind as much. I have no idea what their intentions were as they’re not the kind of parents to make their kids miserable.


I told dad that they should play my version with her so she could catch some people, and explained that it hurt me how they would never play my version growing up. I wasn’t angrily telling him off, I was just explaining that she was probably feeling what I’m feeling, as we’re both on the Spectrum. My dad was quiet and then just hung up. I texted him and he sent me this really long text explains that he “didn’t like how petty I was being.” Which really confused me as I had made it clear I wasn’t holding a grudge and was just explaining something to him.

Not even a week ago we had watched the puppy and dogs from 11-7 for $50 while my mom went on a family outing to a theme park. Now she has plans to go to the zoo, and needs us to watch them all day again.

I declined upon her first asking, neither my partner nor I had any interest in doing it again, especially for that pay, when I know my mother is being paid to puppy sit as well. Despite our polite rejection and reasonings as to why, she decided to ask me again today. Today I responded with, verbatim “I’m sorry you guys wanna go to adventureland and the zoo and sea world and disney land all the time now, maybe you guys should’ve put that into consideration before promising someone you’d watch their puppy for them, none of these are necessary outings.”

I understand I sounded a little harsh here, but the constant asking after politely saying No several times was starting to annoy me. However, I do not feel my mother’s response of “Lose my fucking number you ungrateful human” was necessary or called for in this situation. I personally believe she should’ve have agreed to watch her friend’s puppy if she is going to be having all of these spur of the moment outings that aren’t necessary at all. I think she should be upfront with her friend and not rely on us to watch the dog, especially if she is going to pay us less than she is being paid.

She based this opinion solely on the premise that she is not a cat person despite my cat keeping her distance away from my sister and never doing anything to get in her way.  My cat was a birthday gift I got when I was five years old and she was one of my closest companions growing up. She helped me cope with times such as my parent's divorce and my diagnosis of depression. A couple of weeks ago, my cat started feeling sick and refused to eat so we immediately called the vet. 

Over the phone, they told us that it was most likely kidney failure and to prepare for the worst as we may have to put her down. We made an appointment at 5 pm knowing we would lose our cat in a couple of hours. This was unfortunately the only appointment time we could get but it happened to be at the same time my sister was getting her graduation photos. We didn't want my cat to have to suffer for any longer so we took the appointment time and my Mom was able to reschedule my sister's graduation photos for a different time. My Mom and I decided to spend the rest of the day spending time with my cat, but within our last hour with her, we started crying. 

While I understood that my sister and my cat weren't the closest, I thought my sister would at least feel bad for our loss. Instead, she proceeded to yell at us and say how selfish it was for us to reschedule her senior pictures and that we always ruined her plans. She followed it up by saying that she was ""happy our cat was dying"" and ""is relieved she will never have to see her around the house again after today"". After these comments and many comments similar to these, I immediately started yelling at my sister and we got into an argument in which I called her ""heartless for hating a cat that never did anything to her"". My sister was able to get her old appointment time back and went to get her pictures while my Mom and I took my cat to the vet.

Me (F38) and my husband (M39) are together for a long time. First we dated for about 3 years, then started to live together, and then about 6 years ago we married because we wanted children. 



Our family life is good. I love him, and he loves me, and we don't have big conflicts and incompatibilities. Our goals in life and professional spheres also align well, he originally got a degree in philosophy, but later started working in HR and now at a good middle management level. I am a corporate accountant. We don't have a lot of time to spend together because of intense work but when we do we enjoy it.



We have a 4 year old boy who we love so much.  One day I was playing with him and saw him eating booger from his nose. As children do it I just gently scolded him and thought nothing of it. After some days I saw this again and again scolded  but this time he said to me that 'dad said it's fine'. I was surprised and after some asking I found out he saw his dad doing it, and dad said to him that that's fine and nothing bad.



At this time I recalled that when we just started living together I also saw my husband do it  - many years ago! I was disgusted and told him off, I was so upset we didn't talk for days, but in the end he apologised and said I will never see him doing it again  - that's why I forgot about it.



I confronted my husband and asked about what  kid told me. He was not upset or disturbed. He said that kid told the truth, that he saw him eating  booger from the nose, and he simply didn't want to lie to the kid and said it's ok. When I asked why he does such things, and recalled the story from our past, he said that he knows how it upsets me and he kept his word. But it doesn't mean he stopped, because apparently he just likes eating boogies. He enjoys it. He just doesn't do it when I'm around! And he thinks it's ok to do because it's not hurting anyone.  



He said that I have no right to be so controlling and prohibit to do him what he likes in privacy, that it's not harmful and I have no say. He said he understands my concerns that kid can be bullied for such thing, and he will not do it in front of kid same as he doesn't do it in front of me for all this time, and as he doesn't do it in public.



I'm shocked by his answer. I think it's disgusting. I know it's not a compulsion, because he can control this, as he only does it when he believes it's ok to do it. I offered therapy but he said he sees no point because he likes it and he's not harming anyone. He said if something I can't see or hear concerns me so much maybe I need therapy.



I was shocked by his answers, but maybe he's right, and I'm too controlling, and should find it in myself to let go?

February 23. Cried because he didn't like the breakfast of cream cheese and tomatoes that was prepared for him.   
March 23. Cried because I played a Hamilton song, told me I don't love him and he hopes rats eat my face (?).   
March 28. Cried because he didn't want to bring a jacket to Florida.

51,1eba426,AITA for not thinking of inviting a friend to a big road trip,"A few months ago, a friend organized a group of 16 friends from college to go on a big road trip together to Canada for a few days. She made a group chat 2 months before the trip and after she organized it, we went on the trip.

A few days after the trip, I talked to a friend who went on the trip and he told me that he recently talked to Ben. He said that Ben was really hurt by not being invited to the trip since he's friends with most of the group and that he only found out about the trip shortly before the trip was supposed to happen. Ben also said that he felt like everyone was trying to hide the trip from him and that he cried while we were on the trip.

For context, after Ben graduated from college, he moved to Texas while the rest of us are still in Pennsylvania. I will say that Ben has made trips to visit us in Pennsylvania after he moved, and so another aspect of him feeling hurt is the fact that he feels like none of us are keeping him in mind and putting in the amount of effort and care that he puts into his friendships with us. If he was aware of the trip and invited to it, he might have flown out to join us.

Personally, I do feel bad that Ben didn't get an invite and I understand that he felt left out and would have felt a lot more appreciated if someone invited him. I plan on apologizing to him. But at the same time, although we were close in college and we make an effort to see each other when he comes back to Pennsylvania, when he is all the way in Texas, we don't really communicate or actively talk that much. We'll catch up sometimes, but it's not like we're constantly texting since we don't have much in common to talk about. And when we did talk, the trip just never came up in conversation; It wasn't like I was purposely trying to hide it from him (I feel like everyone on the trip will relate to my last few sentences). And since I wasn't the one who organized and planned the trip, I feel like it wasn't my place to invite other people or my responsibility to inform him. Also, he wasn't the only person who's friends with a lot of us but didn't get an invite. I could think of a couple of other people in a similar boat, and they also live close to the rest of us so they could have easily made the trip. They just didn’t get invited. But those people didn't feel hurt.

The friend who told me all of this also told me that Ben expressed it like this isn't something that he can easily forgive and forget. I tried putting myself in his shoes and so I asked myself: would I have felt left out if I was in his shoes? Yes. Could someone in the group have mentioned the trip plans? Yes. But would I have felt so hurt to the point where I would find it unforgivable? Honestly, probably not.

I'm open to criticism and would appreciate feedback. My question now is AITA for not having thought of bringing the trip up to Ben somehow? And does everyone share a portion of the blame for not inviting Ben?

She made a group chat 2 months before the trip and after she organized it, we went on the trip.

A few days after the trip, I talked to a friend who went on the trip and he told me that he recently talked to Ben. He said that Ben was really hurt by not being invited to the trip since he's friends with most of the group and that he only found out about the trip shortly before the trip was supposed to happen. Ben also said that he felt like everyone was trying to hide the trip from him and that he cried while we were on the trip.

For context, after Ben graduated from college, he moved to Texas while the rest of us are still in Pennsylvania. I will say that Ben has made trips to visit us in Pennsylvania after he moved, and so another aspect of him feeling hurt is the fact that he feels like none of us are keeping him in mind and putting in the amount of effort and care that he puts into his friendships with us. If he was aware of the trip and invited to it, he might have flown out to join us.

Personally, I do feel bad that Ben didn't get an invite and I understand that he felt left out and would have felt a lot more appreciated if someone invited him. I plan on apologizing to him. But at the same time, although we were close in college and we make an effort to see each other when he comes back to Pennsylvania, when he is all the way in Texas, we don't really communicate or actively talk that much. We'll catch up sometimes, but it's not like we're constantly texting since we don't have much in common to talk about. And when we did talk, the trip just never came up in conversation; It wasn't like I was purposely trying to hide it from him (I feel like everyone on the trip will relate to my last few sentences). And since I wasn't the one who organized and planned the trip, I feel like it wasn't my place to invite other people or my responsibility to inform him. Also, he wasn't the only person who's friends with a lot of us but didn't get an invite. I could think of a couple of other people in a similar boat, and they also live close to the rest of us so they could have easily made the trip. They just didn’t get invited. But those people didn't feel hurt.

The friend who told me all of this also told me that Ben expressed it like this isn't something that he can easily forgive and forget. I tried putting myself in his shoes and so I asked myself: would I have felt left out if I was in his shoes? Yes. Could someone in the group have mentioned the trip plans? Yes. But would I have felt so hurt to the point where I would find it unforgivable? Honestly, probably not.

I'm open to criticism and would appreciate feedback. My question now is AITA for not having thought of bringing the trip up to Ben somehow? And does everyone share a portion of the blame for not inviting Ben?

53,1eb9kcl,AITA for parking my car in front of someone's house on a public street?,"I (27M) often stay at my girlfriend Sarah’s (25F) apartment during the weekend. Her apartment does not have guest parking but the apartment is on a public street with free parking so that's where I park. The apartment is surrounded by houses both adjacent and across the street, and most of these houses don't have a driveway. One of these houses without a driveway belongs to Neighbor Dude (late30s/early40sM). I will again be clear, none of these home owners have any legal ownership of spots on the public street.

A few months ago I pulled into an open spot in front of Neighbor Dude's house. I get out of my car and begin walking to GF's apartment when a car coming down the road stops. Neighbor Dude rolls down his window and asks (nicely, I'll grant him) if I'd be willing to move my car somewhere else as it's in front of his house. Mind you, I'm carrying 4 sizeable bags of stuff for the weekend (clothes, food, hiking backpack, work backpack) and there's several inches of snow on the ground. I sigh and begrudgingly oblige. There were no more spots nearby so I had to drive  
my car an extra block away. 

  
Fast forward to recent incident. I again park my car in the same spot. I start walking away from my car but notice Neighbor Dude and his wife pull up behind me with his wife making annoyed ""what do you think you're doing"" gestures toward me.

for an event but beyond that I really don't care that Neighbor Dude and his wife have to walk 5 extra feet carrying groceries. I calmly tell Neighbor Dude: ""This is the second time you've asked me to move my car. This is a public street and I have somewhere to be. I'm not trying to be a d\*ck but I'm not moving my car."" Neighbor Dude just says okay and we move on. The next day I go out to my car and see some insults written in the dirt on my back windshield including ""asshole.""

54,1eb99tc,AITA for staying out late?,"So, I (19 F) and my boyfriend (19) have been hanging out and dating for about 3 months now. Due to the nature of his jobe he often works all day and can't see me until late which is fine due to me being a bit of a night owl. He lives around 20 minutes away and normally I stay till around midnight  though I have stayed out till 2 or 3 a few times. 

Now I still live with my father, I'm in school but I'll be paying him rent once I leave, and he still pays for my car insurance (I put gas in it and try to pay for repairs) and in return I babysit, I clean, cook, and generally try to do whatever he asked. We talked about me staying out late and he said he wants me home around midnight for the month of June because of a family road trip, I agreed and attempted to follow curfew (I missed it by 30 minutes at most). He said it's because hes worried about my health and worried about my sleep schedule.

After July though, I still tried to come home but there were 3 times when i just got too tired and stayed at my boyfriend's house and I told my dad where I was. Recently, I did it again because I needed to be out of my house. I felt trapped and angry and my mental health was awful. So I left and told him I needed air, he said it was fine as long as I was safe. He texted me around 2 to come home but I didn't see the message cause I genuinely fell asleep.

55,1eb9653,AITA For complaining about my friend behind her back?,"My (14f) best friend (lets call her Jane) is very insecure (she's always very conscious about her appearance, sometimes will barely speak to me for a few days because it's too ""embarrassing"" and needs lots of reassurance constantly). One way this affects her is that she much prefers texting to talking in real life, because she can articulate herself better when not worrying about her tone of voice or expressions, etc. 

However, Jane texts A LOT. As soon as I come home from school she will start messaging, and continue conversations for hours. As someone who finds social interaction very draining, I come home wanting time to myself and find this exhausting. I never told her about this though, because I thought she would become off with me, and not talk to me anymore. The most I've said is stating a few times that I hate texting, but she didn't pay much attention. 

This went on for a few months until I came home one day really needing to be left alone with my own thoughts (it had been a very bad day). Jane immediately started spam texting me. I felt months of built up frustration, and in the heat of it all I grabbed my phone and messaged another friend (who had also been texting, but not nearly as frequently) that ""Jane won't stop texting me 😭"".

My friend thought I wasn't being serious and jokingly asked Jane if she had stopped texting me yet, with a screenshot of my message. Que three humongous texts from Jane about how betrayed she felt, that I made her cry and that I ""never want to talk to her anymore"".  

I sent her a long message back about how sorry I was, and that it was a terrible thing to do but she just replied with ""ok"" and isn't speaking to me anymore.

I understand that saying what I did was a bad thing to do, but I can't help but think that if she acknowledged my needs more and didn't take everything I say the wrong way, I wouldn't have ever sent that text.

56,1eb8zuh,AITA for not agreeing to my stepfather “giving me away” during my wedding?,"I 27F am getting to my fiancé in early next year.

My mom married “Phil” when I was almost 22. I was very supportive in her relationship as Phil is a great guy and my parents have been divorced forever. It was time that she found someone and I was happy that she isn’t alone anymore. I however made it very clear that while I would love and respect him as her husband, he will never be my father. More like a relative. To which she and him both said they understood.

Last year, when I got engaged, I made it very clear to her that while he is her husband, he isn’t my father and will not be participating in the wedding as my “father” i.e. not be giving me away or in any other rituals of the wedding. 
He can sit with the family etc,  but just not follow the duties of my father. She wasn’t very happy about it but that was that.

Fast forward to today, we’ve started talking about the guest list and ironing out the details of the wedding when my mom said that as per my culture(I’m not American or catholic) Phil will have to give me away. 

I called that bullshit (not in those exact words) because when my mom remarried, my grandma was the only one who gave her away and that caused no problems.

When she realized that this didn’t work, she told me that it would be very insulting to Phil if he doesn’t get the respect he deserves. I said yes, and he’ll be attending the wedding but not as my father like I’ve always made very clear. She went to say that I’m not accepting of her relationship, I’m making a mess of her life as this will cause a strain on her relationship with Phil etc. 

We got into fight to which she said fine - the best solution is that you get married in city hall so that we can avoid all this to which I said, I don’t want to. 
She then said, she’ll let Phil know that because of this it’s best if he doesn’t come to the wedding and I said that’s her call. I would want him to be there, but that’s up to her.

We ended the call on a bad note and haven’t talked since. It’s been a few days now.

I am very close to my mom since she’s done a lot for me as a single mother and don’t want to hurt her. At the same time, I don’t think it’s fair for her to keep expecting all this from me, While I respect Phil, I don’t want him to participate in my wedding like a father.

So AITA?

Answering some questions from the comments 

1. I don’t have a good relationship with my real dad. He’ll be invited to the wedding as a guest out of courtesy, it’s his choice if he wants to attend.

2. My mom will be paying for half the wedding. I intend to pay for myself, but she won’t have it as she said she’s been saving up for it. This was a reason I wanted an intimate wedding, I don’t want her to get any financial strain. 
I will still try telling her that I want to pay for half of the wedding but I’m not sure if she’ll budge

3. For those who said she’s being manipulative, I know she’s not. My mother is one of the most selfless people. She’s met Phil when I was 8 or 9 and he wanted to marry her then too, but she said no because she thought I wasn’t ready then. 
She told me about Phil only when I was around 19 and then he started coming around. 
She’s not manipulative or selfish- she genuinely believes that it’s the right thing to do.

4. In my culture, both, mother and father of the bride give her away. I told my mom I want it to just be her who does that. 
I don’t want my father, since he’s never been a part of my life and I don’t want Phil because I don’t see him as my father. 
To this she said, Phil will be giving me away as her husband not my father and this still doesn’t sit right with me. 

5. I agree with those suggesting to talk to Phil. While that’s the logical this to do, I don’t have that good of a relationship with him. We are cordial and respectful, but it’s not a close relationship. 
I believe me talking to him for something he isn’t asking for will put a strain on our relationship and my mom won’t like it. It makes no sense doing something that my mom won’t like since she’s the only person who matters to me

My friend asked me if me and her will work out but i told him im not physically attracted to her but i liked talking to her. He got mad at me because his girlfriend only recommended her best friend if there was a possibility that me and her friend Mary would like each other and be in a relationship in the future. Now his girlfriend and he thinks im a scumbag for talking to her without the intentions of dating her. I told Mary"" Hey my friend just told me that I'm wasting your time but for me I just want a penpal but you might not feel the same and want a relationship"". She said she's open to talking and not being in a relationship however the last statement about the last boy she talked to says otherwise. I clarified to her that i just want to be friends and she says she fine with it. 
I like talking to her but I dont see her romatically but now my friend and his girlfriend think im an asshole because this is a waste of her time. 
Where did I go wrong and what should I do? I didnt have the intention of wasting her time but am I wasting her time knowing nothing will come of this. I was going to visit her country with the intention of just hanging out but now my friend and his girlfriend dont like me. I dont want to ghost her because the last boy did that and I geniunely like talking to her. I figured there would be no harm no foul if things fizzled out naturally, but if things keep going maybe shell get attached and i should end things before it gets to that point. We have been only talking for 2 days. Did i fuck up since the beggining by talking to her? What should I do now to make things right?",0.0,1.0325289964675903,1,0

Context: Me (26m) and my wife (27f) have very different “intimate” needs in quantity. When we got together almost 10 years ago, we had almost the same needs.over time her needs diminish at the beginning I put it down to the stress of studies/work, routine, household chores, etc. When we started living together I took care of the household chores in the apartment.I did all the dishes, cleaning, laundry and cooking so that she could concentrate on her studies (I started working)but that didn't help matters for us. we had very little rapport and I felt neglected. we discussed it several times and we finally consulted and we realized that her needs were less physical than mine and that mine was very physical but not necessarily sexual, just more kisses or hugs, helped to satisfy this feeling of being abandoned.


So now things are going well between us. I kept everything that is in charge of the house, I like having the management of the home (the meal ready the way I want it, the dishes are always done the way I want it, the cleaning is done the way I want it), since I finish work before her I have 1 or 2 hours before she comes home. Things are going better between us, we don't have more intimate relationships but when we do, we both enjoy it without pressure and I take advantage of the time without her to satisfy the more ""physical"" part of my needs with ""solo time""



Story: It was a normal day, leaving the apartment I kiss my sleeping wife on the forehead.during the day, the same, everything is normal I enjoy chatting with her normally, what she does/what I do/one of my boring colleagues/one of her colleagues made a mistake/send memes the basic things.

When I returned in the afternoon I had time, not much cleaning, the week's meals were done. so, as I had a desire and time, I took this “for-me time”.  Later my wife came home. I greeted her at the door normally and straight away, she wanted us to go and “cuddle” in bed. Personally, I was still ""tired"" at the moment and I simply told her that for the moment I didn't want to and told her that maybe later or if it was urgent to go to the bedroom. 


she went and then when she came back she seemed a little frustrated. she said that she had seen my sex toy in the bathroom (I had left it to dry after washing it) when she went in to wash hers  and we had this exchange: 

Her: ""it's annoying I really wanted to have sex and couldn't you wait a little for me?"" 

Me: “well why the fuck should I have waited for you?""

Her: ""Well so we can have an intimate moment together I don’t know?!""

Me: ""well sorry but at the moment it's not really my problem. I didn't see why I should have wait for you?""

For this reason, when they found out a month ago they were expecting a boy, they asked me if I would be okay with them naming their son Logan. Reason? My name is Logan and they didn't want to make me feel any kind of offended or annoyed that they were using the name too. I told them I had no problem with it at all. Lily said the name was always on their list but me joining the family made it more special, which was sweet.

They decided on the full name a week or two ago and they announced it over a family lunch on Sunday.

Shit hit the fan immediately. MIL and FIL asked them what they were thinking naming their son after a woman. They expressed a lot of displeasure about my name being a boys name traditionally. But said the name was now directly linked with me and their grandson should only be named after men. Josh told his parents they were being ridiculous and wouldn't they be glad Logan was being reclaimed as a boy name in the family if they were so offended. They said it was still on a female in the family now.

Tommy then tells his parents it's not their decision and the only person they would have accepted criticism about the choice from is me, and I had no problem with them using it. They said they should care about how it looks. Tommy said it doesn't look bad in any way. That people won't care today.

It escalated. Lily tried to calm them down by saying their Logan will love being named after his amazing (and only) aunt. For whatever reason my ILs decided that I needed to step in and they told me I should make it known I am no longer okay with another Logan and I should do it for him if nothing else. I kept eating through most of this so wasn't involved at all. I just said I was good, thanks. But they didn't like that and pressed the issue. Josh told them it was nothing to do with me. ILs said it was because Tommy and Lily made it my problem. Tommy and Lily apologized over ILs. I said it was fine. But please leave me out of it. I gave my blessing. I won't take it back.

61,1eb8d59,AITA for telling my friend that I dont like her best friend?,"
I (17F) have a very close friend, Lorina, who I have been good friends with for over 10 years. Lorina’s best friend, Sabi, was also a close friend of mine but I have recently cut her off. 

To start off with, Sabi has always been a very blunt and outright person, saying whatever she feels and whatever she’s thinking. In previous years, I didn’t mind it and quite simply, I just ignored it. She’s always make subtle comments about what someone was wearing, the method they did something, or their hair , the way they spoke or just anything. Sometimes it was directed at me like “why do you do that” and she’ll laugh or I’ll give an idea on something and she’ll find it funny and laugh in my face. Sometimes Lorina would join in too (not to the degree that Sabi would) but again, I simply ignored all this to not avoid any drama as it was exams.

Earlier this year, Sabi left the school and Lorina and me stayed together. Lorina was much kinder to me this year and I told her about how I was feeling before when Sabi and her were together with me. She apologised and Lorina improved (sabi and lorina are still best friends). Lorina was a lot more kinder to me and mostly stopped the subtly comments and “banter.” 

I didn’t really speak to Sabi that much this year and I’m glad I didn’t because I felt so much better. I wasn’t scared of speaking anymore and thinking about what her opinion would be on what I said.

I recently saw sabi and lorina together. Lorina said hi to me and sabi completely ignored me as if I wasn’t there so I acted like she wasn’t there either. 

Me and a group of friends, including lorina went to the park. Sabi also happened to be there. Sabi didn’t speak  to me and I didn’t either. I later found out that sabi had broken the strap of my bag when she was okay fighting with another person at the park. She didn’t apologise or anything but instead was just laughing and she was blaming the other girl and the other girl was blaming her. I just walked off in silence because who gave her permission to touch my bag. I later came back looking for my bag strap because I was thinking maybe tape or something but sabi had stretched it then thrown it in the bin. 

That was the final straw. I hadn’t liked sabi for so this year because she’s always given off this negative energy and “Idc” vibe that I had only just taken care of. So, I blocked her.

Lorina asked me what happened between me and sabi. I simply told her I didn’t like her anymore and I don’t want a friend like that in my life anymore for the above reasons. I also told her that if I had communicated my feelings with sabi before, maybe none for this would have happened.  But, I was too scared to speak to sabi as I didn’t know what to say. 

Now lorina is a bit upset and I just wanted to know if AITA with the way I dealt with the situation.

63,1eb88sj,AITA for insisting on going on a specific hike that takes a whole day?," 
I (M22) have been wanting to go hiking at a place about an hour away from our house for a few months now, ever since the weather has gotten nice. I work ten-hour shifts from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. and have three days off every weekend. For context, we have two children: a three-and-a-half-year-old and a one-year-old. My wife (F23) is a stay-at-home mom, and recently (two weeks ago) she started a new business cleaning homes on my days off to make a little extra money for our goals. On these days, I watch the kids while she works.

I understand that taking a whole day for the hike (probably about five to six hours) is a big ask, but I do my best to give her breaks. I make dinner most nights, hang out with the kids, and give her time to herself whenever she asks for it. I often take the kids hiking or biking through trails and forests because my wife doesn’t like hiking due to her fear of ticks and bugs. This way, I can do something I enjoy and spend time with the kids.

When I first planned this hike, I wanted to split it into two days. There are two routes: a shorter one and a longer one that totals over twelve hours of hiking. My plan was to hike six hours in the evening, camp, eat, sleep, then wake up early around 5-6 a.m., hike the remaining six hours, and head home. My wife wasn’t comfortable with this and wanted me to check out the area first since I’ve never been there. So her condition was that I take the short route first and then, if all went well, I could do the longer route later. However, I haven’t been able to go on the first hike yet, and I’m worried I won’t be able to do either of them. This is something I’ve wanted to do since last winter, and I’ve been seriously planning it for about three months, asking her for permission for about two months.

Despite all this, every time I ask to go on this specific hike, it’s always a no. We often have family functions or activities that take precedence, like her aunt’s birthday party or camping trips with her parents. It feels like everything else is always a higher priority than something I would like to do, even though I love hanging out with my kids.

I do get breaks occasionally and go fishing or on shorter hikes, but nothing like the one I really want to go on. I try to be considerate by making dinner and spending time with the kids before I head out. I also sometimes wake up early to go fishing before the kids wake up and come back a couple of hours after they wake up.

And I know people online, especially on Reddit, like to ream into dads about not doing very much, but I genuinely try to give my wife as much support and time to herself as she needs. I understand the challenges of being a stay-at-home parent, having done it myself for a while with just one child, so I can’t imagine how hard it is with two.

So, AITA for insisting on going on this specific hike that would take a whole day?


Edit: Just to clear some things up for context, my wife doesn’t work every day that I’m off. She only works when she has clients. I am not expecting her to miss work for my hike. That’s idiotic. So far, there is only three hours on Thursdays and four hours on Fridays. She might pick up occasional clients on Saturdays, but usually, she wants to do something together as a family on Saturdays. With her or ours. I can’t take a day off work because my company lost a contract, and I now work for a new company without any vacation bank. I have to wait until next year to get my vacation banked. Additionally, I take the kids by myself overnight at least once every two weeks so that my wife has time to herself and doesn’t have to handle the kids at night. I take the kids camping by myself. Her parents will also occasionally take the kids overnight. I have tried to go hiking then, but she wants to spend time together alone, which I totally understand and want as well, so we do. They have taken them around four times in the last two months. I was more insistent on going on this hike before she started working.

65,1eb7t8n,AITA for ignoring my mom?,"for context, my mother has been having issues with my dad since i was just a baby. i’m now 15 years old and nothing has changed, so she decided to leave the house in may for good. 

before she left, our relationship was  strained because we were always arguing. she never cared for my feelings and it always seemed like she just wanted a power trip. she had BPD as well.

i used to have a close bond with her, but once i was in 8th grade i started standing up for myself and going to my dad for advice. we started to bond over this, because she victimized him the same way, yet still made him seem abusive to her family for reacting to her tactics. unfortunately, they took her word for it and thought my dad was the problem. 

the issue is that she’s still doing this even after leaving. i have lost a lot of respect for her this past year, since she’s done things like take my doorknob and menstrual products away because i forgot to do the dishes. now, i don’t even want to talk to her. i have tried to get through to her about how hard it has been since she left, and how she needs to stop thinking about just herself. she never wants to listen. she says i’m jealous because she’s happy, but this is false. i’m just trying to tell her that being petty and taking us to court to place PFAs instead of speaking civilly with my father is not the solution. 

all of the disputes over text or call that we’ve had since she left, added on to the previous truckload of trauma she had given me has led me to ignore her and i leave dry texts, as well as not really answer her calls. i feel bad for doing this to her, but i know that it’s the only way i can keep my peace. 

yesterday, she cornered me about how I’ve been acting when i wasn’t expecting it. she told me i’ve been a horrible daughter to her and that i shouldn’t be letting our relationship crumble over this. she says i don’t make the effort i should be making to try and talk or fix things with her. she told me ive been being disrespectful and letting my attitude get the best of me, which is true but also justified. when she was talking, i remained quiet and said “okay” because there was no point in defending myself at this time. she would just continue to put words in my mouth and put her feelings over mine. every time we have one of these conversations, she throws in the accusation that im being manipulated by my dad, but im really just opening my eyes and seeing things for how they are. 

she even admitted to seeing texts between my friends about her and that wouldn’t be possible unless she went though my instagram, so i told her off for invading my privacy after i logged her out previously. she tried to save herself by saying that i hide from her and she had to find out about me through my conversations but i wasn’t having it and hung up. she hasn’t spoken to me since, and now she only calls to talk to my little brother.

66,1eb7qw3,WIBTA if I tell my wife she needs to pace herself when she drinks?,"My wife (44) doesn’t seem to know when to stop or pace herself when it comes to drinking.  Recently it starts off as a beer or two in a 1-2 hour span starting at 7pm (we were at a concert) but then goes straight to gin and tonic, then Tito’s, then another Tito’s between 9pm-10pm.  The harder stuff hits her later where she is not a fun drunk but obnoxious, annoying, and frustrating.  And when this happens we get in a big fight because I get annoyed at all the nonsensical statements/actions/questions.

This isn’t the first time either.  During our anniversary she drank all 6 glasses of wine because she chose a prix fixe wine pairing and her voice started to get loud and arms started swinging wildly and “I don’t care what they say, Imma do what I wanna do!!!”  attitude.  The next day I got upset at her and I told her I spent the anniversary trying to calm her down and take care of her and it ruined the anniversary for me.  She even admittted she didn’t want to “waste the wines” even though she said she didn’t want to drink all of the wine after the 3rd dish (admitted to me after she was recovering from her heavy hangover). 

There were other times when the drinking was excessive including when I met one of her drinking friends (4/5 matinees), when she wanted to visit her old bar on two separate occasions, and when I was on a work trip and the place was all inclusive (lost count with all the drinks she had).  It always ends up in a fight and I do not have fun.  Her excuse is that she doesn’t do that a whole lot which is true because I don’t take her out for a while after her binges and when we do go out, if the fight was recent she doesn’t order anything past 3 and she watches what she drinks, but after this argument I really want to tell her that aside from her knowing she can’t have wine because she now knows she becomes “not a nice person” (her words, not mine) that she limit her drinking to 3 and/or drinking water.  She also said one time she has to take care of our daughter, take care of the home and she’s taken care of and she’s not hurt or anything which I don’t get because it’s not like she drinks when looking after our daughter.  I think she was saying because she looks after our daughter and is a SAHM she deserves to let loose.

67,1eb7m41,AITA for kicking out my niece?,"So basically last summer and this summer I’m taking care of my little niece, She’s a teen so she has a phone.

I have had a dog last year and two this year and my sisters family has an extremely big dog (a Great Dane) and one of my dogs is a mid size JRT and one shortie corgi. Last year my corgi and their dog were playing and my dog isn’t usually aggressive to anyone but their dog started barking at my dog so she reacted.

Since then my dogs are not welcome anywhere with them, they asked me if my niece could come to my house in NYC because she’s never been there and wants to go there with someone young but not a minor, I said yes of course and she was here approx 3 weeks and my cousin was in her room every night calling her dad  (my brother in law) telling how horrible I am and how I’m so boring and how she hates my dog, since she’s been here my dogs are not being welcomed anywhere near her and I live in a loft so it’s not extremely big and she always yells at them.

She also asked me to bring her to expensive restaurants like Carbone etc
and shopping sprees which has cost me over 3k+ and I’m not getting reimbursement ;)

I have to work during the day and she hates staying home alone and insisting that I had to stay home so we could go shopping and I couldn’t ever go out with my friends.

After 3 weeks I had it and told my sister that she had to go home but they were on vacation but I kept insisting and they came up and took her and now they’re not talking to me, my friends and mom are agreeing with me but my dad and her side are saying that I’m the ahole.

68,1eb7jjp,AITA for no longer dealing with my father’s legal issues?,"I (23F) have never had a great relationship with my father (49M). Throughout my entire childhood, he was abus1ve, and I never truly felt a loving bond between us. He was controlling, manipulative, and often resorted to physical and emotional abus3. This left deep scars, and as soon as I was able to, I distanced myself from him.

Last year, my father was arrested in front of us. Despite our rocky past, I was the one who got him bailed out and put together all the evidence and videos to help his case. I felt obligated to help, mostly for my mother’s sake and to prevent further family disruption. I invested a lot of time and effort, hoping it would make things better while also working and going to college. 

Now, he expects me to assist with everything related to his case. He’s constantly calling or texting, and blaming me when things don’t go his way in court. It’s become a huge burden, and it’s affecting my mental health. I’m constantly stressed and anxious, and it feels like I’m trapped in this never-ending cycle of trying to fix his problems.

I’ve tried to visit my mother and siblings, but it’s always uncomfortable. Every visit turns into discussions about his case. He hijacks family time to rant about his legal troubles or to belittle us (only the women of the family), reminding us that he doesn’t need us and that we were a mistake. It’s emotionally draining, and I leave those visits feeling worse than before.

I’ve reached a breaking point. I want to support my mom and siblings, but being around him is too much for me to handle. I feel guilty for not wanting to help anymore, especially since I started this whole process, but I can’t continue to sacrifice my well-being for someone who has never shown me any love or respect.

69,1eb74xb,AITA for not cleaning the floors,"My (25f) boyfriend (25m) have been together for nearly 2 years now. We have gotten in an argument earlier because I told him I didn’t want to clean the floors of our apartment. 

For context, I’m 32 weeks pregnant and we have a rather large apartment with 3 rooms, a large living room and kitchen but a small bathroom. 

He works night shifts, which I drive him to, that starts at around midnight and he gets home at around 10 am, but takes the bus. That being said, I usually manage to fall asleep at around 2 am. 

On to the issue, he asked me earlier if I could pass the vacuum in the whole apartment. I told him that I would try but since I am rather far along this pregnancy, it is hard for me to stand up for more than 15 minutes without having back pains and feeling dizzy. He told me that I was over-reacting and that he heard that women who are pregnant want to be up as much as possible. He says that we can do alot more than I currently am doing, which made me rather upset. 

Note that although I am pregnant, I am the one who cooks ALL the meals, I clean the dishes, I fold the laundry because he only collects the clothes from the dryer and tosses them onto the floor. All I have asked him to do is clean the floors (because he has dust allergies) and clean the cats’ litter boxes (although I must remind him every time, to which he huffs and puffs). I have asked him to cook at times when I get too tired, but he often says “he doesn’t know what to cook” so I end up doing it. 

Anyways, my question is, AITA for not wanting to clean the floors considering everything I do already?

EDIT: People have asked me if I contribute to expenses. I do. We pay each our halves of the rent and I pay the electricity bill, he pays for the internet bill. The government sends me an amount of money (about $800 per month) because I stopped working ( we live in Canada). 

Also, for people saying he needs to learn how to cook, he does know how. When we first met, he used to cook for us all the time when I went over to his place. His excuse is that he doesn’t have any ideas for meals and he did admit to being lazy on cooking. It’s not his favourite, whereas I enjoy cooking but it’s getting rough for me to do so as I am usually up on my feet for 45 minutes to 1 hour when I do so.

She is not close to her family and it was asked of me to come up for a few weeks and do this. My son will be back on call a week and a half after she gives birth. 

She is suppose to give birth in about a month and I was talking about logistics of the whole thing. I asked were I would sleep  and she informed me that I will need to get a hotel. This shocked me since they own a nice home. 

I thought it over and decided I do not want to do this. I was already going to be doing them a huge favor by being a live in maid. I was going to use all my PTO for this and now I will have to also live in a hotel. This isn’t even a culture I am a part of. 

I informed her that I will not be able to come up for the time she wanted if I have to stay in a hotel. I am willing to come up for a weekend at most if I can not stay in their home.

I got a call from my son and he is pissed. He told me that Sierra has been crying since and that I am being a dick. That I am disrespecting her culture and rejecting her from the family. That he knows I could afford this ( I could but I don’t want to pay thousand of dollars to be a maid)

72,1eb70am,AITA: The Public Property Pup Poop Puzzler,"I (30F) and my 2 dogs (10M) and (3F) were on a stroll on the sidewalk in our neighborhood. I'm walking on the sidewalk, both leashes are less than 5 feet.

We are walking by a huge lot with these signs butting up to the sidewalk that say things like ""no pee, no poop"" ""Be Respectful"" ""No Dogs."" The signs are on BOTH the street side and the house side of the sidewalk. I'm pretty nonconfrontational so I could go to the other side of the street but that side is full sun all day and by 9 AM it's hot as hell. AND I don't have to. We can use that particular sidewalk if we want. 

Play by play:

My dog, (10M) suddenly stops and lets out a poo. It happened very fast, like pull on the soft serve handle too hard, fast.

Now, that's irrelevant because even if I knew he was going to poop, I would let him and then pick it up. Her lot takes up the entire block and I wouldn't drag my dog trying to clench a turd down the street. Or have him poop on the sidewalk because that seems worse. He's old and I just wouldn't do that to any being. 

A woman comes out and loudly asks in a harsh tone ""which of y'all can't read?"" 

I was taken aback by the question so I said, ""I'm sorry?"" Giving time to pause my book and give her my attention. She gestures between the 3 of us, ""which of y'all can't read?""

I now understand that this is a rude confrontation about the dogs and so I switch up from politeness to responding ""well the dogs for sure can't read."" 

She starts rattling:
1. my dogs can't go to the restroom there because her dogs go to the restroom there
2. Accused me of being someone she's confronted before (not true).
3. No dire reason why they can't poop on the weird publicish strip of grass off of the sidewalk. She just doesn't want them to.  

Had she been calm, I definitely would have had a polite conversation with her. But I found her passion about the weird publicish strip of grass unnecessarily aggressive.

I just sorta kept picking up the poop and then said, ""well since we are making requests, can you park your cars in such a way that they don't block the sidewalk?"" At this point, I'm just making the point that we all inconvenience others and our choice to live in this subdivision right on top of others means we don't get to have it all our way. 

She said, ""that has nothing to do with your dogs"" and I responded ""no it doesn't but since we are here making ridiculous requests of others I thought I'd try too.""

She continued the ranting and as I walked away, I said ""ma'am I think it's ridiculous that you expect people to drag their dogs away from here when they stop to poop, I'm not going to drag my dog to get to another person's yard but I'll always pick it up. I wish you many blessings.""

She kept yelling but since I blessed her she was also obligated to bless me back like the good southern folks we are.

I happened to have the book at home and we agreed to meet a few days later so I could give her the book. We had planned to meet at exactly 3 in the afternoon at a busstop in the city, that is as far away from my home as it is from her's. (The city i live next to only allows public transports and bikes at certain times of the day.) 

On the day we we're supposed to meet, at 2:50 p.m. Maya sent me a text, not asking me, but telling me that we would meet up at another spot, about 15 minutes away from the old location. I  didn't think too much of it and told her it was fine with ne, but I'd obviously take longer, because the spot was further away. 10 minutes later, the agreed upon time for the original meeting she called me and asked where I was and said that I needed to hurry, because her bus home would arrive in a few minutes. I in turn told her that I couldn't make the bus drive faster. Long story short, that conversation ended in Maya yelling at me through the phone how I didn't value her time and me explaining to her that it was not my problem if she missed her bus when she was the one to suggest the time and place and then spontaneously change up on that. 

When I stepped out of the bus it was still a three minutes walk to where she was waiting and her bus was about two minutes away, so if I had run a bit I would have easily made it in time for her to catch her bus. However, I casually walked there, with no intention to do her any more favors after how she had acted and when I arrived her bus had already left and she said word for word(translated though): ""Don't say a word asshole, you're the reason I have to wait."", and took the book out of my hand. For context: She had to wait 14 minutes for the next bus.

We barely know each other, she's a friend of a friend, and I did her a favor by lending her a book and going out of my way on a free day to meet in the middle, I tolerated her in my opinion disrespectful behavior and still went through with it. But I did see intentionally not spare the effort of running after she rushed me although she had spontaneously changed the meeting place, making her miss her bus. She's currently holding my book hostage as compensation for ""wasting her time"".

74,1eb6ul4,AITA for not getting a job while living at home? ,"I’m 18. I just graduated from high school a month ago. I’ve applied to two jobs (one of which I was, and still am, particularly interested in but they’re VERY full), but I’ve never had a job before. 

My dad has saved $80K for my college, but I chose to do community college for a year or two which is saving a LOTTTT of money. I realize how privileged I am to have this. 

I live with my mom and stepdad. They want to start charging me rent. Only $100 a month. I’m going to get that from my dad, because my mom asked me to do that and he doesn’t mind doing it.

It’s not that I don’t have money for myself. I have $1,400 saved up from selling stuff, Christmas, bdays favors etc. I save pretty well.

My mom, dad and stepdad collectively pay for my living expenses, phone, and car… most of the time, even gas. 

I do want to emphasize that I’m not a crazy expensive child (well, adult) though. I rarely use my car, I take quite quick showers, I never do anything like smoke vape drink etc… like I’m AT LEAST a good kid. If not lazy. 

My mom gets mad because I don’t do things around the house. But I do. She asks me to do stuff every day and I always do it. Yes sometimes she has to ask twice. In my defense I often forget. Sometimes it’s like I don’t even hear her. I don’t do this on purpose. She will ask me to do something when I’m done eating, for example, and I completely forget she asked me to do anything at all. 

And when I’m in a good mood and I actually feel like getting up, I do stuff around the house willingly. This usually happens for one day every once in a while. I’ll get a lot of energy and will vacuum the entire downstairs, do the dishes etc for no reason other than I feel like it. 

I don’t believe I have the confidence or energy to get a job. She always gets very pissed when I bring this up and mentions that “they TRAIN YOU.” 

But it honestly feels like I’m just too stupid. I’m not academically stupid— I finished high school with a 4.0– but when it comes to physical tasks and a lot of things that require common sense I can be very stupid. I’m too scared to embarrass myself and too lazy, to be honest, to want to have a job in the first place anyway. 

She also brings up a good point, which is that more people will think I’m stupid at my first job the older I am when I get it. This worries me. 

It’s not like I don’t have aspirations for myself, but I’m getting so lazy that I honestly just dream of being a housewife. I kind of just want to get married. If I had my OWN place I would 100% have the energy and motivation to clean and keep things pretty/tidy. In fact I find it kind of fun.  

But here for some reason I just can’t bring myself to do it. I only come downstairs to eat. I’ll literally stay and eat for hours on end. Just go on my phone and eat… pure brain rot.

Sometimes I hate being this way but honestly I love it. 

I believe I may be the asshole because a lot of people can get a job and function normally at my age, and contribute to the household, but I am just overcome with laziness.

Am I in the wrong? Am I partially in the wrong? Is my mom in the wrong? Would love some insight. Ty

75,1eb6mxc,AITA for Pulling out of hen/bacherolette party,"One of my best friends is no longer getting married. She has been in an abusive and chaotic relationship on/off for the last two years and he has now left her as he cannot pay for the wedding as he has gambled the money. She is considering getting back together with him if he apologises.

Originally a boozy weekend away was planned. I was involved in the planning and know we can cancel without losing money and that others are planning not to go. A message today was sent saying we should go ahead with this in four months time to cheer her up.

I have replied saying I cannot do it for personal reasons which I will explain to my friend. These are:

- Her Mum and sister hate me and a weekend in their company will cause me undue stress, I am very anxious at the moment and social occasions are particularly triggering this (left another hen party a day early as my stomach was so upset with anxiety)
- I will need to borrow money to attend, I got married a month ago and have debt due to this...the cost is going to increase per head due to reduced numbers
- I am currently trying not to drink due to being exhausted, overworked and stressed alcohol is making it worse

I've been calling, texting and visiting my friend since the news.

If it was her hen party and a one off thing in her life I would break my back to go. However I'm struggling to justify it due to the reasons above. It's till some time away and I feel the need to cheer her up is just now, not four months down the line.

I have been told I am a bad friend by the sister and Mum and now I am very nervous to address this with my friend. They said becuase she attended my wedding and my hen party (a night in iur town) recently it is expected I should be doing this for her. 


I do feel a bit guilty being selfish and would appreciate some external opinions.

I (30f) come from a family of twins. My mom (59f) was a twin, my dad's (58m) father was a twin, and four siblings who are twins to each other. The first pair were my brothers Alan (35m) and Adam and the second pair were my sisters Bella (32f) and Julia. When I was born it was just me and the disappointment in that was made known throughout my entire childhood. My mom prided herself on being a ""twin mom"" and I didn't fit the aesthetic so she didn't put that much effort into me. My siblings were constantly off doing twin things and I was almost never included. 

Whenever my dad would try to get my siblings to include me, my brothers would were quick to say that they were against it while my sisters would reluctantly let me come but made it obvious that I wasn't wanted and had such a terrible time that I wouldn't want to come. My dad had to work a lot so my mom was mostly in control and would almost let her twin children get their way. 

But was hurt so many times growing up but by the time I was in middle school I gave up and developed really good friendships to fill the void. Fast forward to high school and my siblings really wanted to do an overseas trip on my parents' dime but my father refused until Bella and Julia suggested that it would be a good way for me to finally bond with them as they were going to go to a country I was interested in. My dad agreed under the condition that I go to and that's when they started buttering me up and showering me with attention. It took a couple months but I finally was convinced that my siblings loved me so when they mentioned the trip I agreed. 

However when we got there they went back to their old ways and started ignoring me and all the fun activities that were scheduled were only for two or four people due to a ""mistake"" with the booking. As the non-twin I was the odd one out and didn't get to do anything but since it was too late to get a refund for anything and the return ticket had already been purchased my parents told me to just make the best of the situation. My dad was the only one who tried to make it up to me but I was done with my siblings after that.

Fast forward to last year and my siblings were in a bad car accident. Adam and Julia didn't make it but I didn't feel sad about it. Just in shock. Julia was supposed to be Bella's MOH and she recently asked me to be her MOH but I quietly refused. At first I said that I wouldn't be able to give Bella the time she needed but her other bridesmaids said that they could pick up the slack. Bella, Alan, my mom, and a few relatives said that it would mean a lot if I could do and eventually I just snapped and said that I knew full well Bella has never liked me and that I don't care about fostering a relationship with her now that the sister she wanted is gone.

78,1eb6dq1,WIBTA if I told my friend to stop telling me that she's sick all the time?,"I (28F) have this friend (30F) at work. We gotten close and talked about everything since last year. We joke around all the time. Both of us can tell each other anything. 

In the last several months, she's told me (mostly out of the blue) that's she's sick. She tells me that it's her stomach issues. She also tells me she has heartburn and acid reflux. It doesn't help that she has anxiety too. I feel for her. 

I told several times to go to a doctor but she says none of them listen to her. I'm iffy about that because I've had one bad doctor all my life. I don't know if she's overreacting or telling the truth. 

It's just come to a point where it's affecting me. I'm getting drained listening to her talk about her health issues when she can just go to a doctor. I just want to tell her, ""Please stop telling me you're sick unless you're going to do something about it."" I'm right in the middle where I want to tell her this and her get mad at me (she's told me that I'm her emotional support person and I'm completely fine with that) or just let it go and I'll get over myself.

She told me she trusts me and doesn't trust doctors. I believed her and told her.

79,1eb6a89,AITA For D.I.Y-ing My Shirt,"For my (19F) birthday, late 2023, my close friend Eve (19F, fake name) asked me what I wanted and I told her I needed some big t-shirts, BECAUSE I wanted some more t-shirts that I could cut the neckline off to make off the shoulder.

Flash forward to my birthday and Eve DELIVERS. She ate with most of what she got, most of the t-shirts are perfect and so comfortable - except for one. One t-shirt is big and baggy, which I love, but the neckline is weirdly tight and restricting. I have this weird thing that, things too tight or high on my neck makes me nauseous. I had not worn the shirt since the first time I tried it on, which is a shame because it's one of my favourites that she got me. It's so cute, the design is perfect, it's my favourite colour and it's the perfect size, but I cannot wear it because the neckline ruins it and makes it uncomfortable. On tiktok, I kept seeing people cut the neckline off their tops and I have been obsessed with this trend, I have done this with a few of my shirts before (which is why I asked for a certain type of clothes so I could do this). This shirt is literally perfect to do this for, so I cut it off and I now LOVE THE SHIRT. It's absolutely perfect. It's so comfortable and is now one of my favourite shirts to wear.

It had been like a month or two since I cut the shirt, and I have posted me wearing it - in a tiktoks or my snapchat private story - and I have received a LOT of compliments each time I wear it, with people asking me where I got it. Eve had commented on these tiktoks / replied to my stories saying nothing about the fact i cut the shirt, but would say something like ""awww you're wearing the shirt I got you :)"", ""wonder who got you that shirt ;)"" etc. Out of nowhere on facetime one day, Eve tells me she can't believe I destroyed her shirt. She says she's angry and hurt that I cut it because it was a shirt that she bought me. I'm sympathetic but this confuses me because I literally asked her for clothes that I could purposely do this to. I thought the issue would drop, but on two other separate occasions she lets me know that she is annoyed I did this.

There are some circumstances that I would understand why she would be annoyed, for example if it was her shirt that I borrowed/had, it was an old shirt of hers, it was an expensive shirt, if I ruined the shirt, if I hadn't told her that I wanted to do this to my clothes, it was a sentimental/meaningful shirt - but none of these apply here.

Honestly, I don't get why it's that much of a problem because it's MY shirt, I just cut the neckline off so I would actually be able to wear it and now I wear it loads, I had asked her for shirts l that I cut DIY and pre-warned her that I planned to cut them, if I hadn't of cut the neckline, I wouldn't wear it and it would've been a waste of money.

81,1eb67v6,AITA for causing the neighbours to call the cops ? ,"
Hi everyone ! 
First of all, thank you for reading and honesty all feedback is welcome I am completely lost. 

I (27F), had to move in with my mother (58F) a few months ago. I have several painful chronic illnesses that make me incapable of taking care of myself/a home on my own. So she invited me to live in her guest room so she can keep an eye on me too. I warned her I was not in a good shape physically and mentally ( being in pain all day every day takes a toll on you). 

Here comes the problems: my depression symptoms have been taken as contempt. (Not saying hello, sleeping a lot, ect). 
But sherry on top; 10day ago I had one of the worst flare up/pain crisis of my life. Each heartbeat made the pain worse, no medication worked, nor the TENS or heat pad. Anyway, I was in so much pain I yelled. I couldn’t deal with it, the white hot searing pain, my whole body hurt. I didn’t realise I was yelling that loud and so much. It scared my mum’s neighbours (we live in a flat, thin walls). And those neighbours called the emergency services for me. Where I live, it’s procedure to sent the cops for a welfare check at the same time if the neighbours call for yelling/emergencies. 
So while I was being carted off to the A&E, my mum was interrogated by the cops. They kept me for several days at the hospital. 

Now I’m the bad guy in the family, because my mum had to endure the cops because of me.  They really don’t want to understand that the pain was so much I lost touch with rationality. I feel like they still judge me to the standard of my bratty emo teenage years. For context I have sooo many doctors and am trying a new treatment at the moment, it’s just a trial and error waiting game now. 

Absolutely not trying to paint my mother as TA here, just get perspective on the situation to open the dialogue with her 

Edit: English is not my first language so I corrected some terms. Sorry about that 

Edit 2: apparently police interrogation and police questioning are not synonymous. The police just questioned my mum in our living room, she was not carted off to the station. The matter was quickly put to rest when they saw my medical file and the nurse told them I was indeed sick not a victim of abuse.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-24,"AITA for causing the neighbours to call the cops ?

82,1eb5xmd,AITA for not changing concert plans to pick up roommate from the airport? ,"Months ago, my sister, cousin, mom and I bought tickets to a concert about an 1.5 hours south of my city (right next to my parents house). A month before the concert, my roommate sent me a link to tickets and said we should go. I told her my family had had tickets for months but she was welcome to join and come with. Our tickets were GA and we wanted a good spot, so we needed to get there early. I gave her a quick rundown of our plans. She didn’t mention any issues, just that she would be arriving on a flight that day. I suggested taking the rail system (that is free, and drops off 10 min from our apartment) grabbing her car and meeting at my parents. That was the end of the convo that day. 

A week before the concert, as she is packing, she starts asking me about “how this is going to work with her flight.” After some back and forth of me again explaining I have had plans with my family for months, it became obvious she assumed I would move my plans around to accommodate her flight to pick her up. 

I was going to head to my parents around 11am. She asked for me to wait until 12:30 to drive south to pick her up, drive north back to our apartment, then turn around and go south right back to my parent’s house. Missing the entire tailgate and time with my family to spend 4 1/2 hours picking her up. 

I tell her no, so she’s now insisting that I pick her up on the way to my parents house (now she won’t have a car), so she’ll stay the night at my parents house with us and then my sister will drive her to work the next day and I will drive all the way to her work and pick her up the following evening. This was another 3ish hours of me (and my sister, who barely knows her) driving her around when all of this could be avoided if she would just get on the free rail system. I also had plans the next day that would need to be cut short in order for me to pick her up. 

Finally, I put my foot down and tell her that she needs to just get on the metro after her flight, go to our apartment, grab her car and meet us at my parents house. I was so tired of all the back and forth.

She leaves way later than she needs to and my family wasn’t willing to wait any longer. They think she was trying to “punish us” for not picking her up. We already were an hour later than we were supposed to leave waiting for her, so I called her and told her to just meet us at the venue since she was going to pass it anyway on the way to my parents house. She was obviously upset. 

When we got to the venue, she immediately told me how annoying the entire day was for her and was in a bad mood. 

The whole negotiation of her trying to convince me to change my plans to pick her lasted for about a week leading up to the concert and was full of tension. It made it such a stressful day it really took a lot of the fun out of a previous family plan.

The difficulty is that my sister (F32) has 2 children who will be 6 and 8 at the time of the wedding. They are also not the best behaved and my sister and her husband find it hard to control them... which makes me want them not to come even more as I don't want to risk them running wild while they make no attempts to stop them. For some background info - I am not close to my sister at all and she is one of those people who when you meet up, it's all about her so she doesn't even really know me. They also leave it to us to look after them a lot when we're with them. We only see each other when all the family are there but haven't had a disagreement or anything and we only really talk to say happy birthdays etc.

  
Anyway, I messaged her to say we had found our venue and to give her 2 years notice that it would be child free so my niece and nephew can't come. She has kicked off and called it incredibly upsetting and in our recent messages, said that she won't lie to them and they'll also be really upset despite not understanding the situation properly. We love our niece and nephew but allowing them to come would change the dynamics completely. It's also not that we don't like them, it's that we want a chilled, adult only wedding and children do add a layer of stress. There will also be one child on my partner's family who won't be invited either. My sister keeps going on about being 'immediate family' and 'close family' and while she respects a child free wedding and isn't bothered about children entertainment, she'd expect her kids to come. She does also find it hard for childcare as her partner's family don't live nearby but they do have a childminder. My mum has also messaged me to say she disagrees with our decision but when I explained, did say she kinda gets it due to us not being close and her not making any effort. 

  
I am considering responding to say that while we are sisters, we are not close at all and the wedding is our day and yet again she's making things about her. But I also feel really bad as I do understand it is a harsh decision, especially when they find it hard to get cover for looking after the kids. I feel like it could also end our relationship potentially. I'm also considering whether I should just let them come to end the argument but it's not what we want at all.

We were staying at a hotel and had the blue 'Room Service please' handle sign up for the last two days and no room service came in. Theres a 'please give privacy' side thats white for us. However my father has seen some where its reversed. The staff is also majority mexican so I wrote 'Limpia la habitación Por Favor' which is just the spanish translation as far as I remember from high school spanish classes and my mother tore it down and called me an asshole and a racist

I’m doing that occasionally and only if I truly like what I see, I always love the big smiles I get from the people and how happy it makes them. I’m complimenting men and women alike.

Last week I went out with my (F37) friend “Abi” for some coffee. 
I saw a woman in a very bright pink outfit. I normally dislike bright pink but that woman made it work, made it look haute couture even.
I gave her a compliment for that outfit
She beamed, said “Thank you!” and we went on with our ways.
“Abi” then asked me, if I knew who that was and I told her no. I just wanted to compliment her style.
“Abi” then went on about how I oppressed the woman and made her probably uncomfortable and how sexist it was (???).

I have a 12yo nephew named Colin and he and Roman are inseparable. Colin has always been a bit more emotional than Roman. He has arguments with his dad (my brother) and one thing Colin started to do is either walk away while my brother is talking to him or turn his back towards him. 

I wouldn't tolerate that. I also have a 10yo son named Ollie who looks up to both Colin and Roman. Last week, I was telling Roman that he didn't take care of his jobs (take out the trash, his laundry and shower). He was argumentative with me and I said I'm not arguing with you. You're going to do it or I'll take away your iPhone. While talking to him, he walked away midsentence. Then I heard him shut his door.

I said oh fuck that. I went to his room and regulated. On Monday, I was telling Ollie to go clean his room and reminded him to put deodorant on before going to his friend's house. He got mad and argumentative by saying that he knows and was going to do it and didn't want me to remind him. This is out of character for him  because he's very attached to me.

89,1eb4648,WIBTA for asking my friend for a refund?,"I have a friend who ran a small business making a very specialized piece of gaming equipment. I wanted to support his business so I placed an order with him. The piece is labor intensive and we collaborated on the design and materials. He was excited to make it and I was excited to receive it.

My friend was having a hard time financially at the time so I paid for it in advance, which I realize was a mistake. It was a significant amount of money for me (equivalent to my rent). This was early 2023 and it was meant to be completed within a few months. 

For the first few months I got occasional updates on its progress, but after that the updates got more and more sporadic. By the end of 2023 when I asked how things were coming along, the response was always “I’m waiting on one of the parts” or “One of your parts just arrived!” or “I’m swamped with \[x,y,z\] but don't worry, it's top priority.” 

This friend has moved on to his next business venture and has seemingly forgotten about my order. When I ask about it, he never fails to come up with a different reason—every single time. The last time I texted him about the possibility of just being paid back and cancelling the order, his response was: ""Hey \[flitty\]. I did NOT mean to let this go unread. My productivity has been shot since having to deal with the old man’s death. I still haven’t settled his affairs or paying for the funeral so my priorities have been fucked. Let me look at where I am and get back to you asap. By the way..."" and then he invited me to a party related to his new venture. This was 2 weeks ago. (I asked around and nobody has heard of him recently losing a family member.)

I’m starting to feel bitter about how much I paid and how I’ve gotten nothing in return. It's hard because this is a good friend. At this point I don’t want the equipment anymore, I just want a refund. I don’t want this to affect our friendship, and I have actually started avoiding hanging out with this friend group because I get stressed out about interacting with him. When I do see him, he always acts very friendly to me as if nothing is wrong.

To be fair I do believe he started building it at the very beginning right after I paid him, so it’s not as if zero labor went into it. But the last legitimate update I got was some fuzzy close-up photos last summer, so who knows.

TL,DR: I paid a friend a significant amount for some customized equipment, 1.5 years later have received nothing but increasingly questionable excuses, so much time has passed that I no longer want it, and I feel I am owed back what I paid.

Context: I am more financially aided by my parents than she is, any problem I have, simply not valid. 

So yesterday I got in an argument with my father, which was Petty, but it pissed me off, I cannot stand indecisiveness. So I stayed home all day and I was talking to her, she begged me to vent to her because I sounded off.

So I explained to her exactly what happened, she just started attacking me how I am an asshole to my dad, these aren’t real problems, I’m a crybaby, she has to pay rent to her parents, shes moving with her bf, comparing her life to mine and telling me that I don’t have the right to complain about anything until my problems are similar to hers.
 
It pissed me off because I listen to her, give her advice, and regardless of what I believe to be a bitch fit and a real world problem, I still validate her feelings and analyse the pettiest problem to respectfully give her my honest opinion and advice.

I told her that she is a wrong for dismissing my problems, because I am always listening to her shit. 
she begged me to tell her what my issue is, then attacked me for it.

I let her know that I completely acknowledge it was a Petty issue and I just needed to vent, it isn’t serious, but the real issue here is is that she justifies her dickhead behaviour towards me as being an “honest” friend that, her words, every once in a while needs to bring me off my high horse down to Earth. 

she told me that I told her my problem and she gave me an opinion. She’s not gonna lie she’s not gonna sugarcoat anything, she is going to be 100% honest because that’s what a true friend does.

The last thing I’ve said to her, is this. 

Clearly you don’t WANT to understand what I’m saying, so if you’re just gonna continue to argue, don’t even reply to this.
You see an easy target you attack, you enjoy arguing and anyone can see that, someone feels like absolute shit and you use the friend card because you’re honest and blunt but still manage to make the other person feel even more shit, that’s what I’m talking about when you take things too far, a good friend as you would call yourself, takes others feelings into consideration and not dismiss them to your liking. I acknowledged my wrongdoings, something you’re incapable of. Your honesty and just being such a good friend overall has led me to think that between venting to you and bottling up my feelings and issues, I’d choose the latter, because every time I have expressed myself to you, even really serious issues in my life, you dragged me through the mud like today and made it worse. 
So take a look In the mirror, because you look fucking delusional saying you’re a great friend. 

And of course she could not understand this paragraph and kept arguing so I muted her and I haven’t talked to her since.

92,1eb3waz,AITA for bowing out?," Sorry for the long post. 
I (35f) am married with 8 children and 9 siblings. This past February I had an argument with my ex-sister, R(51f), her daughter, T(35f) and ex-brother S(41m) over a disrespectful remark made by T. Our brother, A, died a week later and the day after the funeral S told me I was ""dead to him"". I in turn said ""OK same to you"". T never apologized for remark and R is going along with it. I removed and blocked them all from every aspect of my life and have been less stressed since. 

Our sister K (45f) is getting married next April. K and R are ""best sisters"" and I still talk to most of my siblings. I don't ask about R,T or S and don't ask any of our siblings to take sides. K asked me to be a bridesmatron for her wedding, and I agreed. R is also a bridesmatron and T is the coordinator. I unblocked both R and T on my phone to get proper correspondence with the group. There are 7 bridesmaids in total.

K wanted to have her engagement party ON MY EXACT BIRTHDAY and I told her I'd be out of town and that wouldn't work so she moved it to the following week. The bridesmaids had a meeting and we were planning bachelorette party, bridal shower and other events critical for the bridal party and were asked for ""blackout dates"". My anniversary is 3 weeks before her wedding and my husband and I will be going out of the country for our anniversary. I gave those dates as my blackout dates. 

My phone died and when I finally got it back on they chose those dates for the bachelorette party weekend, I won't be making it. I expressed this to the maid of honor, K's daughter, D (22f) and bride. K made changes in the bridal party and made a new group message to add and remove people. D posted the dates chosen and the are set, even after our discussion. I replied"" I'm not about to play childish games. When we were asked about ""blackout"" dates I gave yall mine and you specifically chose mine. I'm good on the petty behavior."" D said ""How is that petty when that was in the previous group chat? All I did was copy and paste it. It's too early for this enjoy your day. And why are you trying to make something about you when it's about my mama?"" I said ""I'm not making it about me, but as I stated 'We were asked about 'blackout' dates'. I wouldn't be inconsiderate and schedule an event at the same time you have a previously scheduled trip. But yall have it."" 

After considering all of the stuff I have going on and the knowing how my ""family"" is, I decided to bow out of the wedding. Not only have I bent over and unblocked people that were unapologetically disrespectful to me, I realized that it was rude of me to ask her to change her engagement party dates and bachelorette party weekend. Now K is mad at me and calling me ""petty"" for bowing out. Will she miss me at these events, no. Will she be happy I'm not attending, I get the felling she will be.

K asked me to be a bridesmatron for her wedding, and I agreed. R is also a bridesmatron and T is the coordinator. I unblocked both R and T on my phone to get proper correspondence with the group. There are 7 bridesmaids in total.

K wanted to have her engagement party ON MY EXACT BIRTHDAY and I told her I'd be out of town and that wouldn't work so she moved it to the following week. The bridesmaids had a meeting and we were planning bachelorette party, bridal shower and other events critical for the bridal party and were asked for ""blackout dates"". My anniversary is 3 weeks before her wedding and my husband and I will be going out of the country for our anniversary. I gave those dates as my blackout dates. 

My phone died and when I finally got it back on they chose those dates for the bachelorette party weekend, I won't be making it. I expressed this to the maid of honor, K's daughter, D (22f) and bride. K made changes in the bridal party and made a new group message to add and remove people. D posted the dates chosen and the are set, even after our discussion. I replied"" I'm not about to play childish games. When we were asked about ""blackout"" dates I gave yall mine and you specifically chose mine. I'm good on the petty behavior."" D said ""How is that petty when that was in the previous group chat? All I did was copy and paste it. It's too early for this enjoy your day. And why are you trying to make something about you when it's about my mama?"" I said ""I'm not making it about me, but as I stated 'We were asked about 'blackout' dates'. I wouldn't be inconsiderate and schedule an event at the same time you have a previously scheduled trip. But yall have it."" 

After considering all of the stuff I have going on and the knowing how my ""family"" is, I decided to bow out of the wedding. Not only have I bent over and unblocked people that were unapologetically disrespectful to me, I realized that it was rude of me to ask her to change her engagement party dates and bachelorette party weekend. Now K is mad at me and calling me ""petty"" for bowing out. Will she miss me at these events, no. Will she be happy I'm not attending, I get the felling she will be.

93,1eb3rr9,"AITA for being ""insensitive"" about my (24M) friend's (24F) breakup by asking if a trip is cancelled?","Context, 4 of my friends and I are going on a mini day trip. We are all working now, so this was super hard to plan. Finally found a time where we were all free and set the date for friday.

One of my friends had invited her boyfriend, however on monday she confided in me that she was planning on ending things with him because he is unemployed, and has been for the past 4 years with no change.

Honestly, I really wish she had never told me, but she did, and I felt obligated in a way to just give her my two cents on the situation, and comfort her a bit.

They live together, and she is planning on doing this today.

I was thinking about our day trip the whole time, and if this meant it was cancelled, but I didnt want to bother her about it so I just left it.

She has been messaging me throughout the week about this, and I finally just asked what this means for the trip, and she took it as me not caring about what she says is a ""big deal"".

I apologized but she was still uspet, and brought the rest of the friend group into the situation.

All of them sided with her saying that;

1. as the first person she told, I should be more sensitive
2. does the trip really matter over a big ""life"" decision for a friend

I have been comforting her, giving her my opinion, talking with her about her options, since fking monday, I asked- what I believe to be- one valid question about a trip we have been planning for weeks, why am I being outted as a jerk for this? I feel like this is a valid concern to have, not just for me but for everyone.

Only person who seems to understand me is one other person.

This isnt a friendship ending thing, I think she's just upset, and I understand this is a big deal for her, and I understand that our friends are also trying to console her in a sense. I'm not angry at any of them, I understand where they are all coming from too, but I just want to know if this was really wrong of me to ask.

96,1eb35mm,AITA for insisting my fiancé skip a celebratory trip with his soon-to-be ex-employer right before our big move to Canada?,"Me and my fiancé are moving to Canada from Europe. I’m moving first as I already got my employer transferring me, my fiancée will follow in a month (he’ll finish his job in Europe, and handle shipping our things, moving out, etc.). Since my fiancé’s job is not as easy transferable between countries as mine, we agreed to survive on savings and my income for some time, so that he can improve his English and get some professional certifications, which is totally ok with me.

Today he told me he wants to fly to a 10 year celebration of his current employer (they have a big celebration in a foreign country with activities like horse riding, helicopters, etc.). His plan is to fly a few days before my departure to Canada, and return after I’m gone.

Just for context: his current employer is a shady online casino, and their practices are unethical if not illegal.

His reasons to fly are (together with my reasons not to):
- He deserves to celebrate their success (he has no equity in company, it’s not his success)
- He wants to rest and have fun (we are going on a weekend getaway to rest and celebrate my birthday just 3 days before this)
- He’s a team lead, and his 2 subordinates “will feel sad” if their team lead is not there, but everyone’s else is (me feeling sad is fine?)
- We might need something from the company in the future as they have “connections” (the fact that out of 4 years in there he only has proof for 7 months of employment is enough “help” from them for our emigration process)
- They might be offended by him not being there, as they’re still gossiping about somebody missing 5th anniversary (who cares)

I don’t understand him having any loyalty to this company and wanting to attend this event at all, but especially now that he’s leaving the company. I’m also frustrated that he wants to leave me packing alone.

Finally, I consider our situation an emergency, and I sacrifice a lot for our emigration success (working extra hard for promotion, starting masters to get extra points for PR, practicing immigration English exam, etc.). I think this trip does not align with our current priorities, and he should rather invest all his time and efforts in polishing his skills and preparing for the next job.

98,1eb31yt,AITA for refusing to move in with my grandma even though it's probably the right thing to do?,"Over the years, family members have lived with my grandma. Relatives who have been living with her for the past few years are moving overseas, and a topic of conversation that has come up is who should move in with her to replace them.

We live a few doors down from her so my dad has taken it upon himself to find that person, he has decided this person is going to be me. And I could not be **more against** it. He is very stubborn and once he has made up his mind, it’s made up, so there’s no way he’s taking no for an answer.

Why do I not want to?

About a year ago my relatives went overseas for a couple of months, and I was responsible for staying with her during this time. I HATED it. I love my grandma and we get along, but I couldn’t stand how quiet it was, and more importantly the loneliness I felt. To go from living in a house where between my parents, siblings and pets there’s so much noise and life to absolute quiet was a change I did not like. I felt disconnected from them when I didn’t want to be. I felt incredibly lonely during covid and I am really scared of the toll that loneliness may have on me if I move because that feeling will become permanent. So it’s not as if this is some idea in my head, I’ve already had some experience with the reality.

On a practical level, I’m still in school and not due to finish for another year, so I wouldn’t be in the best position to financially support my grandma or myself, and I shouldn’t be responsible for financially supporting a house I don’t want to live in. Not to mention I am *26 years old* and my father does **not** have the right to make such big life decisions for me, *especially* without my input. 

She has no medical problems that require her to have constant supervision or anything like that, she’s just old. I also don’t understand why it can’t be another family member instead – several have come and gone over the years who were able to provide and I have a huge family, it’s not like I’m the only grandchild.

I can’t help but point out his hypocrisy. My other grandma (my mom’s, aka not his) lived alone for years until she passed away and he seemed to have no problem with it, and this is an issue my mom has with this too (which is why I haven’t included her in the post).

Whether I’ll get my way is one thing. But I’m feeling guilty for wanting to say no to living with my grandma. I know she doesn’t have many years left and I feel incredibly selfish for feeling this way. But what’s just as, if not more selfish than that is my dad thinking he has the right to make such a decision for me. Her needs shouldn't come at the expense of my own happiness.

Personally, I am not the type of person who expects friends and family to pay me back when I spend money on them unless it's agreed upon to do so.

Lmk if I'm TA though.

102,1eb2oj7,"AITA for giving my 17-year-old son a lot of money to make up for my past mistakes, even though my husband thinks it's too much","

I'm 32, and my husband is 34. We’ve been married for three years. I had my son when I was 16, and I deeply regret some of the choices I made and how I treated him during his early years. I’ve always felt immense guilt and love for him and am determined to make things right.

Recently, my son came to me with an ultimatum. He told me that if I wanted his forgiveness and to rebuild our relationship, I needed to give him a significant amount of money. He didn’t offer any other options or conditions. He said he would save the money for his future, but if I couldn’t agree to give it to him, there was no point in continuing our relationship or talking to me. He also asked that I spend more time with him, which I happily agreed to.

I make good money and don’t see why spending it on my son is a problem. My husband thinks I’m being excessive and that I’m enabling my son rather than helping him become self-sufficient. He’s concerned that this could set a bad precedent and believes I’m trying to buy my son’s forgiveness.

My ex, who is my son’s father, has weighed in as well. He says he has no control over what our son wants and that it’s ultimately up to me to make the decision. He doesn’t blame our son for wanting this, but he feels I should be the one to decide how to handle the situation.

I don’t see anything wrong with giving my son the money. It’s money I don’t need, and my son is my priority. I believe this is a crucial step in mending our relationship.

AITA for prioritizing giving money to my son and agreeing to spend more time with him as a way to make up for my past mistakes, despite my husband’s concerns and my ex’s perspective?

EDIT: After talking it out with my son, he just wants me pay for him go to college I’ve decided I’ll be paying for his college and will give him an allowance while he's at college, as suggested by a commenter. This way, I can support him financially while ensuring the money is used for his education. I also wanted to mention that I had already given him $2,400. After our talk, he tried to give it back, but I told him to keep it and consider it an early birthday present.

I'm pretty close in age to my niece and nephew so we w always gotten along well. I live fairly close to my mum but my niece lives down south with her partner and I haven't seen her in a year.

It was a lot of stress, I remember once venting privately about it as I was running through all the money I had saved, and my parents found out and were livid I was complaining--again I just was privately venting about my situation and it was indeed stressful thinking about the potential of losing the house and it all riding on my 30hr a week fast food income.

To be clear, I have always been the semi-black sheep of the family. I have autism, and while it seems obvious to me that most of my family has autistic tendencies, they think I am being stubborn and dramatic because ""everyone is like that."" I know I'm the least favorite child and grandchild, but let's continue.

I do not cook for myself. While I can make very, very basic meals, it's very stressful and I always worry about burning myself. Generally, my fiance cooks for us both, as he enjoys cooking. My grandma thinks this is entirely unacceptable, because what if he dies suddenly and I need to fend for myself? (I'm not saying she's wrong, and I'm working on it, but she berates me every time she sees me.)

For Christmas, she got me a cookbook of complicated recipes full of mushrooms, which I don't eat. I asked if it was maybe for my sister, who loves both cooking and mushrooms, and she said, ""Well, it was originally, but we found something better for her.""

The ""something better"" turned out to be a trip to a fairly local cave attraction. The cave doesn't have an entrance fee, so really what they were gifting was the drive to and from there, about an hour each way. They were right, though, it was better. For me.

Expensive, thoughtful gifts kept coming. She rented my parents a massive beach house for a week in mid-July because they love the beach. She got my brother a car because his was falling apart. I think my cousins went on a cruise with them to the Carribbean.

108,1eb1gb7,AITAH for laughing politely at my partner's jokes?,"I (28F) have always been shy and socially anxious.  After hanging out with friends, I'd get feedback that I was too quiet and didn't talk enough.  Over the years I learned that laughter helped to ease a lot of different social situations.  I could laugh along with the group and participate in social interactions without having to share too much or feel vulnerable.  When men said inappropriate things in public or hit on me when I was way too young I could laugh it off a bit and walk away without creating a confrontation.  As a result, I developed a habit of using laughter to smooth out social discomfort.

My partner has been aware that I do this, because I've described it before in other situations.  But he has recently discovered this also happens in our relationship and now it's really bothering him.  When we first started dating and he made jokes I didn't find funny, I wouldn't laugh and he would ask me what was wrong.  I communicated many times that nothing's wrong, I just didn't find that joke particularly funny or relatable.  It started to get a little exhausting and as a result, I started giving him a polite laugh to acknowledge that I heard the joke and to encourage him to keep sharing things with me.  It felt uncomfortable to have to repeatedly justify that there's nothing wrong with me or the situation just because I didn't find his joke funny.  I know his intent wasn't to gaslight me, but I have a history of experiencing that and it was making me feel like there was something wrong with me for not laughing in those moments.  I thought a polite laugh could help meet both of our needs and keep the conversation moving.

He recently saw me politely laugh at something a stranger said to get out of an awkward interaction and asked me if I ever force laughs with him.

He has communicated that he feels lied to and insecure about his ability to make me laugh now.  It seems that he feels this was a breach of trust to use that type of social nicety with him.

AITAH for using polite laughter to make those social interactions between us less awkward?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-24,"AITAH for laughing politely at my partner's jokes? I (28F) have always been shy and socially anxious.  After hanging out with friends, I'd get feedback that I was too quiet and didn't talk enough.  Over the years I learned that laughter helped to ease a lot of different social situations.  I could laugh along with the group and participate in social interactions without having to share too much or feel vulnerable.  When men said inappropriate things in public or hit on me when I was way too young I could laugh it off a bit and walk away without creating a confrontation.  As a result, I developed a habit of using laughter to smooth out social discomfort.

My partner has been aware that I do this, because I've described it before in other situations.  But he has recently discovered this also happens in our relationship and now it's really bothering him.  When we first started dating and he made jokes I didn't find funny, I wouldn't laugh and he would ask me what was wrong.  I communicated many times that nothing's wrong, I just didn't find that joke particularly funny or relatable.  It started to get a little exhausting and as a result, I started giving him a polite laugh to acknowledge that I heard the joke and to encourage him to keep sharing things with me.  It felt uncomfortable to have to repeatedly justify that there's nothing wrong with me or the situation just because I didn't find his joke funny.  I know his intent wasn't to gaslight me, but I have a history of experiencing that and it was making me feel like there was something wrong with me for not laughing in those moments.  I thought a polite laugh could help meet both of our needs and keep the conversation moving.

He recently saw me politely laugh at something a stranger said to get out of an awkward interaction and asked me if I ever force laughs with him.  I truthfully explained that I did and why, and listed many other situations where I find laughter helpful in that way.  He has communicated that he feels lied to and insecure about his ability to make me laugh now.  It seems that he feels this was a breach of trust to use that type of social nicety with him.

109,1eb16up,AITA for Charging Bachelorette Party Guests Only for Activities They Attended?,"My sister, Sarah (34F) and I (38F) are the matrons of honor for our other sister, Kelly (37F) and recently planned her bachelorette party. Kelly lives in a big city in Washington, but decided to have her bachelorette party in Boston, which is the nearest big city to our home town, where Sarah and I still live. 

The planning process was rough. Kelly’s friends from Washington continually tried to insert themselves into the planning process, with one girl even going so far as to send us an entire slide deck with the party completely outlined from activities to décor and extras. Later, this girl even booked an event that was in direct conflict with one of the events that we had already booked without asking us. However, it is important to note that despite this level of intervening these friends never once mentioned budget and in fact were continually suggesting unnecessary extras (e.g., “swag bags”, costumes, décor). 

The party arrived and everyone had a great time, but of course it’s when the bill arrives that things take a turn. We had a few large items that needed to be settled up after the fact - the Airbnb and a limo ride. For each item I divided it’s cost by the number of people that attended it (minus the bride of course) and then gave each girl a total based on the events she attended. So, if someone did not sleep at the Airbnb but did come to the limo ride her bill would only be for her share of the limo ride. When the girls from Washington received this bill they were not pleased. They believe that I should split the cost of all items evenly across all people that attended any event during the bachelorette, regardless if they attended that particular event, or if there was even room for them at that particular event. So if someone did not sleep at the Airbnb but did do the limo ride they would be billed for their share of the Airbnb and limo ride. They believe that this is even more justified because it reduces their bill and they had already incurred significant costs for flights. They had also assumed that everyone in the group would be attending all events even though that was never discussed and makes zero sense, since if everyone slept at the Airbnb and did the limo ride we would have been over capacity in both cases and needed to upgrade to a more expensive option. They also believe that as the matrons of honor we should incur additional costs as part of our matron of honor duties. They have sent me an amount of money using their methodology based on total estimates that they came up with for the costs of these items (not the actual receipts). They also are not paying Sarah for the cost of their food at the Airbnb, believing it should be part of the additional costs that we incur as the matrons of honor.

112,1eb0ide,AITA for changing my mind about taking a puppy from my friend's dog?,"

My friend has a lovely dog. A few months ago, she decided to search for a female for her dog to have puppies. I really love her dog so much (I love dogs and I always mentioned I would love to have a dog), so she said she will give me one puppy as a gift (she told me she doesn't want to hear objections from my side cause she knows how much I love dogs). I was happy and excited about that. It would also be a benefit to her and her husband, because their dog will be always close to his puppy and they mentioned they will take him to visit us more often, so the dogs can play together. 

It sounds lovely, but I am not sure I have a lot of time for this.

After taking care of another friend's dog for more than a week, I realised that I'm not ready for that. A dog needs much time and attention, and me and my husband have full time jobs and we like to travel. I don't wanna ask our friends or  parents to take care of our dog every time we travel. Is not correct and it isn't their responsibility.

Another important thing is that we're thinking to have a baby in the near future. It will be too much for us.

I don't wanna take the dog and then make him feel lonley. A dog deserves all the attention in the world.  Also, I don't wanna take the dog under pressure. Now I feel like if she gives me a puppy (even if I pay for it, and I really wanted to pay!) I need to be always available for them to visit us or to hang out with the dogs.

Her dog is a very popular and loved breed and I'm sure all the puppies will be sold quickly.

She and her husband are expecting us to take the puppy. 
So I don't know how to tell them I changed my mind, but I know they will get upset...

What should I do?

116,1eaz4bt,AITA for acting like my boyfriend’s stepsister to prove a point? ,"My (27f) bf (26m) “Matt” and I have been together nearly four years, and moved in together earlier this year. 

His stepsister “Clara” is currently staying with us for a few weeks on and off and that’s where the problem arises. Clara has always been a “princess” type. That’s her thing, whatever. But it’s always annoyed me how Matt reacts to it. He goes along with it completely, he is her doormat from the second she arrives until the second she leaves. I always figured that’s his choice and his business so I never said anything about it but since she’s been staying it’s really been bothering me. 

He carries her things like a pack mule, runs around every morning trying to get her the breakfast she wants, makes reservations at restaurants he hates just because she likes it, and gives her free use of his credit cards to buy whatever she wants. There’s other things but these are the type of things.

I feel so awkward when he’s fawning over her like that. I’ve spoken to him about how he acts around her and his excuse is always “what am I supposed to do, that’s how she is”. I asked him if he doesn’t find it inconsiderate and annoying and he said no. I don’t believe him. I don’t believe he could not notice that the way she acts is inconsiderate. 

So I tried an experiment. I started acting like her. Last week, the last day she was here, I said I wanted fresh fruit for breakfast. When Matt didn’t say anything, I asked if he’d go get some, which he did. When we went out for lunch I didn’t even offer to pay. When we went to run errands after lunch I made him drive 30 minutes to the next town over to go to a particular shopping centre, and I took longer than usual choosing products. I also made him drive home. I could see he was a bit annoyed by me but he didn’t say anything. Later, I suggested we order take out instead of cooking and when he said ok I asked to order on his app. Clara got home after we ate and Matt spent most of the evening playing video games with her because he was clearly upset with me by this time. After she went to bed, Matt confronted me, asking if I was ok because I had been acting odd all day. He said I’d been treating him like he works for me which he didn’t appreciate, but if I was stressed or upset we should talk through it. I told him that I had spent one day treating him exactly how his sister does, and he hated it, so he can’t say he doesn’t notice how she is. Matt got mad and said that was an insane thing to do, and he noticed because that’s not my personality. He called me childish and said I’d wasted a day for nothing. 

It’s been a few days and things have been awkward. Matt has been spending evenings gaming or with friends and has been cold to me. I don’t think I did anything that bad but my girlfriends say testing him like that was stupid when Matt treating Clara like a baby really doesn’t affect me so I should just ignore it. Now I feel bad. 

Edit - Clara is also 26 (a lot of people asked) ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-24,"AITA for acting like my boyfriend’s stepsister to prove a point?  My (27f) bf (26m) “Matt” and I have been together nearly four years, and moved in together earlier this year. 

His stepsister “Clara” is currently staying with us for a few weeks on and off and that’s where the problem arises. Clara has always been a “princess” type. That’s her thing, whatever. But it’s always annoyed me how Matt reacts to it. He goes along with it completely, he is her doormat from the second she arrives until the second she leaves. I always figured that’s his choice and his business so I never said anything about it but since she’s been staying it’s really been bothering me. 

He carries her things like a pack mule, runs around every morning trying to get her the breakfast she wants, makes reservations at restaurants he hates just because she likes it, and gives her free use of his credit cards to buy whatever she wants. There’s other things but these are the type of things.

I feel so awkward when he’s fawning over her like that. I’ve spoken to him about how he acts around her and his excuse is always “what am I supposed to do, that’s how she is”. I asked him if he doesn’t find it inconsiderate and annoying and he said no. I don’t believe him. I don’t believe he could not notice that the way she acts is inconsiderate. 

So I tried an experiment. I started acting like her. Last week, the last day she was here, I said I wanted fresh fruit for breakfast. When Matt didn’t say anything, I asked if he’d go get some, which he did. When we went out for lunch I didn’t even offer to pay. When we went to run errands after lunch I made him drive 30 minutes to the next town over to go to a particular shopping centre, and I took longer than usual choosing products. I also made him drive home. I could see he was a bit annoyed by me but he didn’t say anything. Later, I suggested we order take out instead of cooking and when he said ok I asked to order on his app. Clara got home after we ate and Matt spent most of the evening playing video games with her because he was clearly upset with me by this time. After she went to bed, Matt confronted me, asking if I was ok because I had been acting odd all day. He said I’d been treating him like he works for me which he didn’t appreciate, but if I was stressed or upset we should talk through it. I told him that I had spent one day treating him exactly how his sister does, and he hated it, so he can’t say he doesn’t notice how she is. Matt got mad and said that was an insane thing to do, and he noticed because that’s not my personality. He called me childish and said I’d wasted a day for nothing. 

It’s been a few days and things have been awkward. Matt has been spending evenings gaming or with friends and has been cold to me. I don’t think I did anything that bad but my girlfriends say testing him like that was stupid when Matt treating Clara like a baby really doesn’t affect me so I should just ignore it. Now I feel bad.

117,1eay0l2,AITAH for not sticking up for my husband. ,"My husband (33m) and I (33F) have been married for 5 years, together for 7. 
Recently, my husband went away to on a research conference aboard. He was gone for a week. I was at home with our two children and two dogs by myself. 
The night he left, he knocked on my neighbours door ( my friend) with the intention to ask if they could keep an eye on me (I have depression  and anxiety) he was worried about my wellbeing with all the added pressure while he was away. 
My neighbour was already in bed and her daughter answered. He didn't tell her why he wanted to talk to her mum and basically said don't worry. He then left for the airport. 
I didn't  know he had knocked ect.. 
The next day the neighbour messaged me to asked why he knocked and I obviously couldn't give her an answer. 
She then told me, her daughter was worried by his behaviour because it came across as hostile and if he was to knock again the he need to drop the attitude.  This was very direct and I didn't know how to react. 
I just said okay I would speak with him because at that point I didn't know why he had knocked. 
When he came back, I had forgotten about it an told him about a week later. 
He was very upset because that was never his intention. 
He then blew up at me saying that I should have stuck up for him. Because it didn't matter if I knew why he knocked, I know he's not actually like they how they described him. 
He even went on to day say that I am so desperate for friends that I will allow people to say what ever they like without defending him. I am a people pleaser, I know that about myself and I hate confrontation. So I avoid it. 
He hasnt spoken to me in two days now. Should I have stuck up for him? Have I been an AH? 
For context, my husband is a genuinely lovely partner. We both work full time- and we both split household and parental responsibility.  50/50. I have no issues otherwise.

120,1eawz26,AITA for telling my dad and stepmom to suck it up and accept my maternal grandparents are getting equal honors at my wedding?,"I (26f) am getting married this year to my amazing fiancé. We/I have made some choices that have been unpopular and might make me TA.

My dad and stepmom have some really bad blood with my maternal grandparents and vice versa. My mom died when I was 6 and my brother was 4 and my sister was 3. Out of the three of us I'm the only one who remembers mom. My younger siblings don't. And when dad remarried when we were 9, 7 and 5, they quickly went from calling her by her first name to mom. I didn't. My grandparents called her our stepmom, which is where bad blood quickly set in. My dad and stepmom said they (grandparents) should acknowledge her actual role in the family, which was as the new mother in our lives. They told me my grandparents should be encouraging me to accept stepmom as mom.

Dad tried to cut my grandparents from our lives but my grandparents fought back in court and got one day a month with us in court. Dad and stepmom hated this. They also told me I wasn't being fair to my stepmom. I told her so many times she wasn't my mom and they told me that wasn't kind, or fair. That she was doing her best and she loved me as her daughter but was rejected constantly by me. 

We were in therapy for three years. There were a lot of discussions, including about my grandparents, which only worsened my dad and stepmom's toward my grandparents. Specifically, the fact I said twice in therapy that I would rather live with my grandparents. That I craved the connection to mom more than the family they were making.

Things kinda settled much later, when I was almost ready to move out, and so I stayed in touch and tried not to be too unappreciative for the fact my stepmom tried. I knew my siblings loved her just as much as I loved mom so for their sake as well. But I always felt more connected to my grandparents and I never felt a real connection to my stepmom even though I don't think she's truly bad.

While planning our wedding my fiancé and I did a lot of talking about what our wedding would look like and whether we'd go traditional or not. He knew I wished mom could be there. He knew I was missing her throughout this and he suggested I include my grandparents in her honor. So I asked both dad and grandpa to walk me down the aisle. And both my stepmom and my grandma were included like a mother of the bride might be. All four would be seated at the ""parents"" table too. This is what felt right to me and my grandparents are on board. My dad and stepmom complained and accused me of disrespecting them by including my grandparents so much. They said I was using my grandparents to diminish their roles in my life. I told them no. I was honoring my mom and my grandparents in my life by doing this. When they didn't let up I told them to suck it up and accept it or step back if they want. They called me a bridezilla and told me I was taking out petty childish emotions with my actions toward them.

122,1eawmeu,AITA for leaving my mom on her birthday because she wouldn't stop talking about my half siblings?,"My mom turned turned 60 last week and I took her out to dinner to celebrate. It was her, me (21f), my girlfriend (22f) and my mom's best friend. I also spent most of that day with her and we went shopping, etc. During dinner she talked about how my half siblings should have come. I told her she had the option to invite them if she wanted them there but I couldn't and wouldn't make contact with them.

Couldn't, because I have no contact info for them and we are not social media friends. Wouldn't because they have been very clear they want no contact with me.

To explain why. My mom was happily married to my half siblings dad and they were a happy family. Then he died. My half siblings were 12 and under at the time. Mom ended up in a cycle of quick marriages that ended just as fast and almost 5 years later I was born from one of the failed marriages. My half siblings didn't see me as a sibling or as a member of their family. They view me, have always always viewed me, as an accident. As someone who should ever have existed. They did not want me to exist. They did not want another reminder that their dad was gone and mom was throwing herself at all kinds of men. They wanted a neater family, where all the siblings had the same two parents. Me sharing only mom was less neat, it was more complicated. I didn't have much to do with the oldest. He stopped coming around once the other two moved out of the house. But before that he'd come and he ignored me. I got used to it. The other two were close to each other and because of the age gap too, I was the outsider. It was rough being on the outside when I was small. And mom was never very stable or steady. According to mom's best friend the death of her husband was always going to be the death of the woman and mom she was. She loved him and she found she never loved or found happiness after him. Each new husband was a distraction at best.

The contact with my half siblings lessened so much over time. They are not very close to mom either. But they check in on her from time to time. They speak to her occasionally. They send cards and stuff for birthdays and Christmas, for her though and not me.

I attempted to make contact when I moved out by sending a follow request on social media, but they never accepted. That was it.

So back to the birthday dinner. I had told mom ahead of time and told her if she wanted my half siblings there, she'd need to invite them herself. She didn't. Then during dinner she kept saying how I should reach out, how we should be close, I should have invited them and all kinds of stuff like that.

124,1eawihi,AITA for not believing my own family when they say i’m a narcissist?,"Hello everyone, i’ll try to make this post as short as I can.

My family and I (22F) have a very complicated relationship. But right now i’m having an issue with my brother.

My brother is two years younger than me, my mother always has his back, he’s always been condescending and protected, he’s never actively supported me in any of my beliefs or passions (which i do believe i have done for him) and has not shared much on his personal life with us since he was 16. Because he is so withdrawn from the family, my parents always seek him out to try and make him trust them more. I did too, until i realized that i shouldn’t beg for his attention anymore, and it wasn’t doing me any good.

We all live together and today i got into a pretty fucked up argument with my brother, it started as a stupid fight (like a lot of the times) but this time the way he disrespected me made me feel so bad i started crying, i couldn’t take it anymore and i left. My mom of course saw the state I was in and confronted me. After i explained the fight she hugged me and told me she’d talk to my brother afterwards, I asked her not to but she didn’t pay me any mind. 

I went to the bathroom to get cleaned up and i could hear through the door a part of the conversation between my mom and my brother.He was pretty calmly telling my mom how i thought i had a huge ego problem, how i always acted superior because I was close to getting my degree, and just how better than them i think i am, he even mentioned talking about it with an uncle we have (who i thought i was close with) and he agreed. My mom didn’t say anything regarding that but she did tell my brother she understood.

I was shocked to hear this, as I actually have a pretty low self esteem, i think i’m failing in my academic life and think very little of me in almost every aspect. To be called a narcissist was one of the things i didn’t expect to be said about me. I cried a lot thinking, Could I actually just be a narcissist? Am i really in the wrong here?

",No A-holes here,2024-07-24,"AITA for not believing my own family when they say i’m a narcissist? Hello everyone, i’ll try to make this post as short as I can.

My family and I (22F) have a very complicated relationship. But right now i’m having an issue with my brother.

My brother is two years younger than me, my mother always has his back, he’s always been condescending and protected, he’s never actively supported me in any of my beliefs or passions (which i do believe i have done for him) and has not shared much on his personal life with us since he was 16. Because he is so withdrawn from the family, my parents always seek him out to try and make him trust them more. I did too, until i realized that i shouldn’t beg for his attention anymore, and it wasn’t doing me any good.

We all live together and today i got into a pretty fucked up argument with my brother, it started as a stupid fight (like a lot of the times) but this time the way he disrespected me made me feel so bad i started crying, i couldn’t take it anymore and i left. My mom of course saw the state I was in and confronted me. After i explained the fight she hugged me and told me she’d talk to my brother afterwards, I asked her not to but she didn’t pay me any mind. 

I went to the bathroom to get cleaned up and i could hear through the door a part of the conversation between my mom and my brother.He was pretty calmly telling my mom how i thought i had a huge ego problem, how i always acted superior because I was close to getting my degree, and just how better than them i think i am, he even mentioned talking about it with an uncle we have (who i thought i was close with) and he agreed. My mom didn’t say anything regarding that but she did tell my brother she understood.

I was shocked to hear this, as I actually have a pretty low self esteem, i think i’m failing in my academic life and think very little of me in almost every aspect. To be called a narcissist was one of the things i didn’t expect to be said about me. I cried a lot thinking, Could I actually just be a narcissist? Am i really in the wrong here? But because of the things i mentioned above, i don’t think I can be, i borderline hate myself, i don’t know how the fuck i portray this image that i feel superior. I never brag about school (there’s nothing to brag about), never bring up any other accomplishments (there aren’t many).

125,1eawamm,AITA for not staying with loose/stray dog? ,"My back story is that I work nights so that I am able to be home with my son during the day while my husband works. I get off work and get home within about 5-10 minutes before my husband has to leave. This is relevant to my decisions in this situation, which is why I'm bringing it up. 

On my way home from work one morning, I turned onto a neighborhood street and came across a dog in the middle of the road eating garbage or roadkill or something. This street does not have any kind of shoulder really, so I pulled as far as I could to the side and put my hazards on, and got out to try and grab the dog. As soon as I opened my door, the dog started growling at me and when I took a few steps toward it, it took off running down a side street. 

I got back in my car and turned down the street the dog had run down, hoping maybe I'd scared him into running back home, but unfortunately he  was just standing in the middle of the road on the side street. I got as close as I could to him as I could with my car and took a picture just in case he ran off again, which he did once I got out of my car again. I figured it would be less safe for the dog (and for myself) to be chasing it around in the wee hours of the morning, so I went back to my car.

Once I was back in my car I called animal control, gave them a description of the dog and told them where it was. The woman I spoke with at dispatch said she would send an officer out to try and catch the dog. Hung up the phone and realized while I was sat in my car the dog had wandered back to the street to finish eating whatever it was in the road. I thought about what to do at that point, and then I realized I'd been there trying to catch this dog and on the phone with animal control for about 25 minutes. Needing to get home and thinking an officer would be out shortly, I left, hoping that the dog would be ok.

After I got home I posted on the local Facebook group the picture of the dog and a brief description of what happened, and said to contact animal control about the dog. Sometime during the day someone had commented that the dog didn't make it, that they'd seen it's body on the side of the road. After that comment, there were bunches of people saying I was an awful person for leaving the dog there to die, how could I be so heartless, they wouldn't have been dissuaded by growling and would have taken the dog themselves to the shelter, and that I needed to ""do better.""

I feel awful for this poor dog but I also feel like I did the best that I could at the time? I don't know. ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-24,"AITA for not staying with loose/stray dog?

one time i talked about my little sibling and how they make me the happiest, he ignored me and put a disgusted face (remember he is a middle aged man and my sibling is 3 and also my parents broke up long time ago i think it was back when i was 4)(I have a really big age gap with my sibling i’m in college)

I told him how i was making origami and how happy i felt because it was a good distraction he told me i should be doing productive things such as reading a book or learning a new language (reminder i’m in college and i study my ass off but he is not here so he just talks bc he has a mouth)

One time i told him i’m sensitive he told me i’m weak and how crying would never take me anywhere and how i should be focused on school and that i should eradicate my feelings (I told him i was crying because i missed my grandparents who raised me and loved me, they passed away)

i just assumed he was mad, but then he brought up how my grandparents raised me and look i felt like he was looking down to them it felt like him trashing them, the ones  that raised his only daughter, the ones who loved me so much, the ones who were there for me when i was sick, and that’s something i’m not going to tolerate, next he trashed my mom, and my mom told me one of the main reasons she divorced him is that he said ""your family is trash my family is the one that is worth it"" and look my dad hates his family the only one he cared was his mom so i don’t know how he has the face to say that, i want to hate him. i was so mad  that i blocked him but should i just look pass everything he does bc he is paying  college and he never financially neglected me (i forgot to mention he used to scream at me bc i never called him and because i’m friends with a lesbian).

127,1eaw4g3,WIBTA for asking my family member to leave me alone? ,"TLDR; my distant family member keeps messaging me daily and asking to meet up but I really don’t want to, and Im going to ask him to leave me alone. 

I (24F) have a great-cousin (around 40M) who messages me pretty much on the daily. It’s usually every morning: ‘Morning love how are you’. I know he has struggled with mental health problems and loneliness and I really don’t want to make him feel isolated, so I usually reply with ‘not bad thank you, how are you?’ Or something along those lines. 

He’s now started buying me things, unsolicited of course, like candles or air fresheners and asking me to meet up, go to the cinema etc. I’ve only seen him maybe 10 times in my life and the last three have been in the past 5 years. 
We have a really close family but me and him aren’t close. 

I don’t really feel close enough to meet up with him or accept gifts. I just wouldn’t feel completely comfortable. 

I ask him sometimes ‘is everything okay? You have been messaging a lot recently’ and he will say things like ‘trust me you don’t want to know my problems’. I’ve had calls from him in the past at about 1am when I’ve been sleeping. He has also said self depreciating things about his weight/how no one likes him etc. 

I’ve offered comfort in the past but it becomes too much for me, especially when I have a lot on myself.

Me and my friend were playing online on Mario Kart. I had just barely hit a set amount of points online, (by only a hair), then a communication error happened.

I was obviously a bit angry at this discovery, and texted my friend that I was going to join a different lobby to regain my points, and asked him not to join, because I wanted to regain my milestone on a win.

After one race in the lobby, I was only 8 points off of my milestone, and I noticed that he had joined. We played through the race, with him in first and me in second. I threw two red shells at him (red shells lock on to the person in front of you if thrown forward), and won the game, regaining my milestone.   

After the race was over, I left the lobby, as it was really late at night, and I wanted to sleep.

132,1eauktb,AITA for ignoring my love interest?,"I 27(M) was talking to a lady 29(M). We were high school friends, but we were never that close. We started talking online again around April in 2023. She was working in another country in Europe while I reside in an arab country.

We grew closer over the months, we would video call and all those online relationship stuff and it was very clear we liked each other. We both acknowledged that we liked each other and started discussing a serious relationship around October of that same year. She then came to visit the country I am in around October too since her family is still in the country, we took this opportunity to go on a few dates.

Everything went great, I took her to the beach, shopping, arcade, restaurants etc. We grew even closer since it wasn't long distance anymore, even for a short while.

She left in November back to the country she works in and this is where things got weird. We were fine in November, but when December came around she grew distant. She would start replying late or just give me dry responses. I asked her about what was going on because I assumed she was going through a hard time with work, and she told me that she was social media detoxing. I asked her why she didn't mention this to me as I was worried why she was so distant all of a sudden and then she told me ""now you know"". So from December until the end of January she was very distant and throughout that time I would ask from time to time what was wrong because it was obvious it wasn't just about social media detoxing. One day I had enough and told her ""can you actually talk to me instead of just dismissing me? I can tell something is wrong, can we actually talk about it instead of ignoring the issue?"" she then again dismisses me and says ""It is just your imagination. Nothing is wrong""

So from December until January she was being distant and I had no idea why. February comes around and I am tired of whatever games she was playing, I left one of her dry responses on seen and we did not speak for months as she never texted me after that.

We don't talk from February up until May, but she would send me snaps on snapchat of random stuff.

Around late May I was on vacation and she replied to my IG story asking ""When will you be back?"" I told her I would be back by the end of the week. We talk for a bit after that and then she says that we haven't talked in a while. I told her last time you told me you were detoxing so I left her alone. We have a disagreement about the situation and her stance on it is that I didn't try hard enough, I asked a few times and that was it. My stance was that I already knew something was wrong, I asked and was patient with her, but ultimately I gave up because she would not address the situation.

The conversation goes back and forth for a while, but she ultimately admits that she was going through something, but did not tell me. She has not even told me what that something was.

We started talking online again around April in 2023. She was working in another country in Europe while I reside in an arab country.

We grew closer over the months, we would video call and all those online relationship stuff and it was very clear we liked each other. We both acknowledged that we liked each other and started discussing a serious relationship around October of that same year. She then came to visit the country I am in around October too since her family is still in the country, we took this opportunity to go on a few dates.

Everything went great, I took her to the beach, shopping, arcade, restaurants etc. We grew even closer since it wasn't long distance anymore, even for a short while.

She left in November back to the country she works in and this is where things got weird. We were fine in November, but when December came around she grew distant. She would start replying late or just give me dry responses. I asked her about what was going on because I assumed she was going through a hard time with work, and she told me that she was social media detoxing. I asked her why she didn't mention this to me as I was worried why she was so distant all of a sudden and then she told me ""now you know"". So from December until the end of January she was very distant and throughout that time I would ask from time to time what was wrong because it was obvious it wasn't just about social media detoxing. One day I had enough and told her ""can you actually talk to me instead of just dismissing me? I can tell something is wrong, can we actually talk about it instead of ignoring the issue?"" she then again dismisses me and says ""It is just your imagination. Nothing is wrong""

So from December until January she was being distant and I had no idea why. February comes around and I am tired of whatever games she was playing, I left one of her dry responses on seen and we did not speak for months as she never texted me after that.

We don't talk from February up until May, but she would send me snaps on snapchat of random stuff.

Around late May I was on vacation and she replied to my IG story asking ""When will you be back?"" I told her I would be back by the end of the week. We talk for a bit after that and then she says that we haven't talked in a while. I told her last time you told me you were detoxing so I left her alone. We have a disagreement about the situation and her stance on it is that I didn't try hard enough, I asked a few times and that was it. My stance was that I already knew something was wrong, I asked and was patient with her, but ultimately I gave up because she would not address the situation.

The conversation goes back and forth for a while, but she ultimately admits that she was going through something, but did not tell me. She has not even told me what that something was.

133,1eaug4h,WIBTA for cancelling a hangout with my long distance bestfriend ,"I **29 M** (Canadian), and my best friend Roger **28M** (American) are in a long distance friendship. We're each other's best friends. We met on a double date when I was acquaintances with his Ex.  Since then I'm much closer to Roger than I am with his ex. We've known each other for 6 years at this point and have been close for 3.5-4 years. We connected during the pandemic and have been very close since . We live far apart but in the same time zone and speak regulary on facetime like when we game online.   
  
I have been teasing and asking Roger to visit me for roughly a year at this point (b/c I've only been working for 6 months at an okay paying consistent job at this point and need to save some money before I would be able to visit him). Roger has been seeing Ben for about 2.5 months by the time they arrive.  They're not even official.   
  
So when he told me he was visiting with Ben, I was happy because I'm available for the entire weekend cause I'm off work for the summer. Though Roger only wants to hang out for 2 days *(but really its 1.5 cause his return flight is at 9PM on the day last day I'm hanging out with him*). I wanted to plan with Roger but he told me Ben has a list of things he wanted to do. 

  
I feel a little hurt because I don't think he's not really here to see me despite him telling he is. He told me that my city was his 3rd choice for a weekend getaway with Ben. I'm off and available for all the days Roger and Ben are here for. He doesn't even want me to pick him up at the airport when he arrives in the morning, and wants to spend his first day he arrives with Ben only. I understand they're sort of a couple, but Roger and Ben live 1 hour away from each other by car. and see each other nearly every week for 1-3 days. I live 1.5 hours away by plane from Roger and we call once a week. So now he's doing the planning with Ben first because it's Ben's first time here. So the places I wanted to take Roger would overlap/be similar. I have to plan around them. 

I personally don't think Roger is here to see me and that its more so that I just happen to be here. When I told Roger that I don't think he's here to see me, he said I want to introduce you to Ben and the other days are reserved for bonding with Ben.  
  
So would I be the asshole to cancel hanging out with Roger because I'm a little hurt that I have to plan around them, and that they can see eachother all the time but he only chooses to see me for 1.5 days and not the full duration of the stay. 

I also looking for advice, if I'm wrong to feel like this and if there was some solution to it.

*Side note - Last time Roger was here, he was with his former significant other and it was during the pandemic where restrictions were lifted at the time but when they arrived, the restrictions came back in. So many places and exhibits were closed. Roger primarily stayed in the hotel room during his last visit.*

135,1eato6l,AITA for wanting back my money and getting upset about it?,"Some time ago I (F23) stayed in another city, 3 hours away from home due to my job.

During my stay I met a guy (M25), let's call him Daniel, we started dating a bit but already in the beginning he seemed kind of toxic. He would kick me out of his place after me being there for around one hour because he wanted to hop on some online games, he stood me up one time too but that's another story.

  
Anyway, one evening my friends and me planned on going out and I asked Daniel if he wanted to join. He had some struggles after changing his bank with transferring his money, so he said he couldn't come with no money.  
I really wanted him there, so I borrowed him 50 bucks for the night. 

This must have been around 1,5 months ago. He told me he transferred the 50 bucks, I got home for good after the two months stay in the city and still didn't have any money, didn't want to be pushy though, so I waited two weeks to ask about the money. He said apparently he typed in the wrong IBAN, he will try again now.

4 days and still no money later, I texted him once again, asking about it and he said he transferred it. Since this day I message him every day, asking to send me a screenshot from the transfer but he always said he will later, never sent anything though.

  
Today I've had enough and shot him a big text, saying that it's sad he borrows money from a woman without paying back, especially since he always talked about how great his salary is. I wrote that I wish him the best and I hope for his future he will learn how to treat women.

Another thing I wrote was that I need every cent I can get, because my rent is due in a week and I can't afford it.

He then sent a voice message saying it's not his fault that I can't handle money well, and the 50 bucks he owes me won't pay my rent either. He got really toxic, said he can't believe what I just sent him, saying I won't see my 50 bucks ever again. 

Mostly though he talked about how it's my own fault that I can't afford my rent, not his. He said things like ""When your bank account is empty when rent is due, it's your problem not mine and you should question how you handle finances"" or ""If you think you won't get back the 50 bucks, okay. But I can't do more than transferring the money which I did"". The whole voice message is just him being a dick.

(I was supportive the whole time he wanted to do SO, but wasn't thrilled about it and didn't tell him that) he went to the recruitment office, told them got a list of new jobs and put in for some really cool ones that fit his personality and his vision more.
So I said, ""I'm happy for you, this is going to be so good for you, and honestly I didn't want to say anything before because I wanted you to choose what was right for you. But I didn't think SO was right for you"" (he said your body and mind is totally shot, guys knees are all messed up by the time they're 40)
""YOURE TOO SWEET to have to go through all that""
And he took it as an insult, saying that I just thought he was too soft and too weak and I didn't believe in him.
Its been a few days he didn't talk to me at work, won't say I love you, hasn't spoken to me in days and told me ""Is it not okay for me to not like something you say bc it comes across a different way than you mean it.""
""I'm not just making it up in my head when something comes across like that bc I've brought it up to other people and they agree that it doesn't seem nice or caring when you talk to me about me the way you do.""

141,1easiqy,WIBTA if I asked my friend to pay my medical bill?,"This situation involves my friend ""Chloe"" (20F), her boyfriend (who is also my friend) ""Dylan"" (20M) and myself (20F).

Chloe texted me 2 days ago to ask if I could accompany her to an event today that she was going to speak at. I said of course. Today I asked where she wanted me to meet her to go to the event.

She was confused and said she didn’t know she was giving me a ride. I replied confused and apologized for misunderstanding her and misinterpreting her invite, I just thought she would pick me up since she invited me and asked me to go with her. She said it was all good, chalked it up to miscommunication, and said she would get me.

When she came to get me, her boyfriend, Dylan, was in the passenger seat. I said hi to them, opened the door, and put my bag in the back seat. I was about to get in the car when Chloe started driving and ran over my right foot. Dylan said, ""Wait hold on, she's still getting in.""

Chloe had been fiddling with the maps app on her phone and hadn't seen that I was still getting in. She apologized, said she wasn't paying attention, and asked if I was okay. I told her that I felt fine and that she just ran over my foot. I was wearing Crocs so I didn't have much protection between my foot and the car.

She panicked, came out of the car to check on me, and I told her that my foot hurt a bit but that I felt fine due to the adrenaline rush of realizing ""holy shit my foot just got run over"". I assured her I was okay for now and she continued apologizing the next couple of hours. I assured her I was okay (with a bit of pain building up) but I didn’t want to say anything since she already felt terrible.

We hung out at the event which included walking and I could feel my foot getting worse but it was bearable. Afterward, Chloe and Dylan dropped me off. At this point, my foot was very swollen and I wasn't able to go to work which consisted of walking a lot. I ended up having to contact my manager so they could swap my shift with a coworker.

My family has medical insurance and after calling my mom and boyfriend to let them know what happened, they suggested I ask Chloe to pay for whatever is left of the medical bill after insurance. I have a doctor's appointment lined up (which Chloe helped find) with X-rays. My boyfriend asked Dylan to drive me (with Chloe's permission) since my boyfriend has to work and he is also friends with both of them.

I feel bad asking her to pay since we’re friends and it was an accident, her family is well off but recently has been going through a financially straining situation, and I feel like I shouldn’t ask since she feels really bad about it and gave me a ride to her event, aka already doing me a favor.

143,1eas6iv,AITA for helping my friend get rejected?,"For context, I (16M) live in NJ and Chris (16M) moved from here to GA where he meets Jen (16F) and Lew (16M).

I have known Chris since the sixth grade. He moved down to GA before eighth grade for his dad's job. For the past four years, Chris had not developed any crushes on any girls, but in February, me, Sam (16M), and my other friends Eve (16F) and Pete (17M) were introduced to Jen without knowing that Chris had a crush on her, although we had our suspicions. Jen joined our friend group and played video games with us often.

About two weeks after we met Jen, Chris personally told me that he had a crush on her, and I told him to let me know anything that he needs off his chest about it. I offered genuine advice and truly believed in him. Sam, Pete, and I all believed in Chris because this was the first time he liked anyone in the history of our friendship, he was being less mean, and he was brighter and friendlier than before.

In March, I was in a call with Sam and Jen joined. She said that she knew that Chris liked her, but she didn't like him back. We began to help Jen figure out how to reject Chris. Some time into the call, Lew joined the conversation.

Our conversation progressed to planning to stop Chris from making advances on Jen. We thought to prevent him from going any further with Jen as soon as possible for the sake of his heart not being broken. We made a group chat and I sent screenshots of Chris and I's texts to communicate his feelings toward Jen to the group. Over the next two days we planned how Jen would tell Chris and turn him down after school. She does, and Chris is sad for a little bit, but everyone stays friends.

In May, Lew decided to reveal everything to Chris. He shows the group chat and everything all in front of their lunch table at school. They all make fun of him, and he’s humiliated. He texts everyone involved, upset that Sam and I helped Jen, and that Jen asked us for help, and he also texts Pete saying, ""thanks for not being fake."" Chris is especially mad at me for sharing our texts, which I understand, as well as for not planning on telling him about it. I decided to take most of the blame out of the four of us involved just to make it simpler and spare them. In my apology I mistakenly downplayed the situation, which made him more upset. Chris and I didn't speak for two weeks, but eventually everything went back to semi-normal. He alluded to it sometimes and we argued about the situation once or twice.

Two weeks ago, Sam and I, along with Pete and Eve, flew down to GA to visit Chris for a week, which has been planned since March. The whole trip, Chris was passive aggressive toward me and Sam. He didn't allow Jen or Lew to see any of us while we were there, either. Sam and I made plans to meet up with Jen and Lew, but we never did. We think the trip might have been better if we never helped Jen.

I've been home for a week and Jen has since shared that Chris doesn't want to talk to us anymore. I'm okay with that, but AITA for helping Jen in the first place?

Edit: For some added context, Jen asked me and Sam for help. She didn't know how to deal with it and she said that her social anxiety makes it hard for her to deal with things like these. She wanted to let Chris down easy and turned to us for advice.

Chris's advances included constantly setting up dates with Jen that she would either not agree to or avoid by saying that she was busy or sick. Even after, he would just move dates back until they fizzled out. He would never take no for an answer, and he would tell us that he still thinks he has a chance with her months after this happened despite Jen being firm in her rejection.

For Chris preventing us from seeing them, Jen and Lew both wanted to see us. They invited all of us as a group to go see a movie, but Chris shut that down and took us to the movies without them.

The owners were there and took both of them from me to go play or whatever. I said be careful with my chi. He has terrible recall and also screwed up knees called luxating patella. He’s got it in both knees. His surgery is scheduled for October (one knee) bc that’s when my husband gets his bonus check. He’ll get the other knee done a few weeks after. 

Well, the owners fell in love with my dogs. And I guess me saying my chi needs surgery, they decided to put together a fundraiser and raffle. They said it would benefit a dog that needed surgery. I showed up to support whatever dog needed surgery and throw a couple bucks. Come to find out, the dog is mine. They made a big show of it. Me and my husband are regulars, we’ve been so supportive of them since they opened and their causes, we take care of their bartender (we tip well) etc. 

I know I should feel appreciative? But like WTF? We don’t need money lol. My dog is just fine waiting til October. He’s not dying. Giving us money isn’t going to speed up his procedure. I was so embarrassed! I said “no no, this isn’t necessary please give this to an animal that really needs it!” But they were all like awwwww. Like I’m being humble? I went outside to smoke a cigarette and somebody said “wow so funny y’all buy shots for people but can’t even afford to pay for your dog’s surgery. Priorities, I guess.

I dragged my husband out to the car after leaving cash for our bill and WTF’d the entire way home. We’ve had several texts from the bar manager and the owners telling us to come get our money! My husband said I’m being an AH for not getting the money and just donating it to a good cause. I refuse to be used as a promotion for donations when WE DON’T NEED DONATIONS.

145,1earvew,AITA for making my boyfriend’s sister pay for herself? ,"I 24 Female have been in a committed relationship with my significant other, 26 Male, for over 6 years. I have met his family really early on in our relationship. I have always envied close friendships between girlfriends and s/o siblings, since i’ve always wanted to bond and be like an older sister or cool friend they can rely on. But my boyfriends sister who is 18 Female, can be a little to herself and doesn’t share much with anyone, but she is very funny and nice, and doesn’t care much for typical teenager things like makeup, or partying or other things. My boyfriend has always been the one paying for our meals, but it became recent where his sister began to tag along more often with us, ever since she graduated high school. It wasn’t too big of a deal. Sometimes my bf paid for meals or I paid for all 3 of us. Recently we all started going on trips together, we have done 1 trip to Socal, and then a long distant one to Oregon. (FYI we are from NorCal). The SoCal trip was with their parents, so they pretty much paid for everything. Our Airbnb stay, also our tickets to Disney Land, and pretty much most meals we had all together at a family. Besides the tickets, me and my bf paid for everything else, food, fast track passes, etc… for our trip to Oregon we also paid for everything, including flight tickets, train tickets, airbnb accommodations, food, activities, etc… it has never been an issue. But after some time we realized that she may be spoiled, and that no one has ever really tried to give her responsibility to pay for her own things. She shares a bank account with her parents. (She does have a job and she’s been working for over 1 year.) So technically when she does pay it comes out from the parents credit card. My bf and I are planning to go on a trip to Florida, we have a comedy show we will attend as an anniversary gift to me, and since we were in the area we wanted to check out Disney World. This got the attention of his sister, even though we did mention to her that we will be going and if she wants to come she can, she in a way assumes everything will be paid for. Their parents know about this trip, and they know she will be coming along, but in this scenario they did not offer to pay for anything. So this concerns my boyfriend and I, because we would have to pay for a bigger accommodation place plus 1 extra ticket to Disney World, + meals. At this point we want to save as much as we can, and if by now she doesn’t realize that to have fun she needs to contribute then I'm not sure how she will ever learn. I love her and everything, and sometimes she can come off a little selfish. Going back to her sharing bank accounts with her parents, sometimes we ask for her to use the card to pay, whether it may come out of her bank line or the parents. So would it be rude of us to ask for her or the “parents” to pay for our meal once in a while. So AITA for wanting her to pay for herself?

I don’t make any money and my only bank account is a joint account with my husband. My husband has three bank accounts. 1. Joint account with me 2. A personal banking account 3. His business account. I only have access and password to the joint account. My husband is a great provider. He puts money in the joint account twice a month for bills/living expenses/etc. and then adds more money whenever I ask for it. We aren’t millionaires, but I don’t want for anything and he will buy anything I want. I do a lot of giving to foster children and their families and he fully financial supports that. My name is on the mortgage, cars, etc. I just say this to point out I don’t have access to a lot of things, but he also loves me and takes care of me. 

So I already have two of my husbands emails on my phone. One email receives all the emails from my step daughters school and the other email receives all of the emails from my step daughters church group. I added these emails to my phone 10 years ago. I handle all of the kid stuff and he would forget to tell me he got emails and we would miss things for my step daughter. So I moved his emails to my phone. I don’t have access or know the email to his business email.

Now to the point, my husband has one other email account that is attached to the paypal account. He’s had this email for years, but I have never had access to it. Tonight I asked him for the password and went to add it to my phone. I have four different things coming in the mail (one is a bookbag for a foster child and school starts soon so I need the info ASAP) and because I used paypal to purchase them I don’t have access to the shipping info without his email address. I just assumed it would be fine so I didn’t ask permission. I just asked for the password.

Edit: I do have my own email account. But since I’m not the BIO parent to my step daughter and she has two active parents I can’t be on the school email list. As for church email list.. My husband set it up that way. 

This really upset my husband. He told me he did some research and me having access to his emails was a red flag for a controlling wife. He told me he was uncomfortable with me having access to his emails so I deleted the accounts from my phone, but… 

AITHA for…
1. Having his emails on my phone 
2. Being hurt by this and thinking that he must want to hide something from me? Or maybe he wants to separate himself from me more? 

Thanks for the advice.

148,1earbwj,AITA for asking my boyfriend to acknowledge when others are out of line even though it was not the best way to do so? ,"I've been having ongoing issues with my boyfriend's tone when he speaks to me. Sometimes he suddenly shifts to a dismissive, ""I don't give a fuck"" attitude, which really hurts me. Whenever I bring it up, he denies it and says it hurts him to apologize because he wasn't trying to be mean. This makes me hesitant to bring up issues with him, as I know this will be his reaction, but this also upsets him.

Recently, we had a fight after some people said they would introduce their daughters to him if he didn't have a girlfriend. I know it's not his fault what others say, but it triggered something in me. I started wondering why he's so nice to others that they feel comfortable making such comments, but often snappy with me. This isn't a one-time thing; other people's mothers have made similar comments multiple times. He has also cheated on one of his exes in the past.

I wanted to discuss how I would like him to respond to these situations and it led to a massive disagreement. I wanted him to acknowledge that the comment was out of line and to call the mother a bitch in private, just to put my mind at ease. He refused, saying he doesn't have to call her a bitch just to make me happy, out of respect for her.

I understand it's unreasonable to expect him to say that just to make me feel better, but at the time, I felt it would have eased my mind, especially given how he treated me the past week. He acknowledges that calling her a bitch is disrespectful, but hasn't been respecting me, his own girlfriend.

149,1ear8ho,AITA for kicking my roommate out now that she’s quit taking her meds,"  
My roommate (let's call her Sarah) and I moved into my parent’s vacation home about two years ago. Sarah was in a toxic living environment and I was in between jobs and my parents didn’t make us pay rent. 

For context: We were friends in high school and have a large group of mutual friends. 

The first six months were pretty miserable. Sarah’s mental health was terrible. We barely make small talk and the only time she’s tolerable to be around is after she smokes weed. Sarah works a lot and so I do all of the cleaning, like, *all of it*, including pickup up after Sarah. 

Sarah’s OCD makes it hard for her to find food to eat and I was often the one tasked with either ordering or preparing food for her. During this time it was extremely hard for me to think about the future while I was stuck basically taking care of my roommate. 

Sarah recognizes none of this. She never says thank you, or sorry, or even cleans up after herself without being asked to. I was feeling pretty burnt out–AND THEN Sarah got a girlfriend and started seeing a psychiatrist all within a few months. Things weren’t perfect, but Sarah had emotional support and her meds were working!

Things were kind of nice for a while, Sarah and I were friends again. We watched movies and had inside jokes–we had fun! She started doing more chores. I mean we’re human and would get annoyed with each other sometimes, but overall it felt manageable. 

I started writing again, and even made plans to go back to school. It was even good enough that I planned on continuing to live with Sarah while I was in school for the next few years. 

But then a few months ago Sarah stopped taking her meds. She didn’t really mention why, just that she felt extremely depressed afterward. She stopped talking to most of our mutual friends and stopped hanging out with her GF on her days off. She started snapping at me over small, simple things. Like yelling at me when I ask her what she’s cooking, etc. 

I had the flu in June and wasn’t able to clean the house. It became disgusting, and Sarah would comment on it without doing anything to fix it. I got fed up and went to stay with my parents. I was only supposed to be there a week but it felt so nice to be away that I stayed for six. During that time I got a job that will be a great opportunity for me, but it would require moving closer to the city. 

I’m afraid of what will happen if I tell Sarah that I’m leaving. First it means that she will need to find somewhere else to live. (With her Mom probably, who is an emotional and financial leach). Second, I fear it will make her mental health deteriorate even further. 

I’ve offered to help Sarah out with therapy but she has no interest in going. I’ve offered to help her update her resume to get a better job but she doesn’t want to do that either. At this point I feel I’ve done all I can do.

Am I the asshole for not wanting to deal with my roommate anymore?

151,1ear4d5,AITA about my dad’s health and guilt for him? ,"My dad who got diagnosed with kidney Cancer last year has been a world of joy to deal with…everything I do comes with consequence. 

I cook/cooked for him ( I use Cookunity for him now, since I got a FT job), pay his bills, clean his clothes, take care of house hold chores when I can/ cleaned his upper portion of his house (stage 3/4ish hoarder), and basically didn’t finish college last year to help him recover from a stroke he had in April, then subsequently diagnosed with cancer in October. 

For a while now I’ve pitied him and got him donuts because he doesnt go out as much. As of recently he’s been DEVOURING sweets. He mainly has asked for Tapioca/Rice pudding, or donuts….but he’s a diabetic… 

A few weeks ago I bought him a half dozen of donuts on Wednesday to keep him happy over the weekend, and then he calls me saying he finished it by Friday or a Saturday.

He’s a very literal person, when his doctor said sugar isn’t bad for him, he derails himself and things he can intake as much sugar as he wants and as long as his glucose meter doesn’t hit 200, he’s “fine”.  He fluctuates hard too, can be in the 100’s to just under 300’s. The most consistent he was recently was when I sick and couldn’t bring him anything. 

So that was a little backstory,

Today I brought him a half dozen of donuts today (dumb but guilt at the same time) and he has an ant problem and they apparently swarmed the donuts before he got to them. I for one hate to see donuts go that way, money wise, but I think the ants are doing him a favor. Like he didn’t even acknowledge that I brought them, I said a few choice words because they are donuts, like at minimum he could’ve said “thanks for trying but he said it would’ve been nice if I could eat them.”

And the first thing he tells me is “I’m not thinking with my head” and where I put them in the living room. The only two places that don’t really have ants are his room and the bathroom and the only reason his room probably doesn’t have ants anymore is because he rarely eats in there anymore. 

As I’ve gotten older I’ve really noticed my dad is an insane narcissistic and even helping him it’s always a damned if you do, damned if you don’t. My memories with him are pretty
much blacked out from what crap times I’ve had with him. 

This is pretty much put a nail in the coffin of “big” sweets/guilt for him, at minimum I’m going to keep small sweets for him for his diabetes if he needs it for low glucose…idk I’m irate 

Sorry for poorly condensed storytelling.

I brought my dad donuts and ants swarmed them the same day and then my dad was pissed he couldn’t eat then and told me I wasn’t using my head” on placement of the donuts in the living room. Even though the ants can practically get them anywhere in the house if given time. 

When my dad told me it’d be nice to eat them instead of at least thanking me for trying. I blew up on him about something as small as donuts but also him not caring about his health, but I try and do things besides care for him because I feel guilt about for him but he doesn’t make it easy at all after he says what he says to me a lot of the time.

Me, friend 1, and friend 2 are good friends, but we didn’t invite friend 3 (21F) since I’m the only one who is “close” with her. I’ve hung out with friend 3 a handful of times, and the four of us only hang out all together occasionally, like going to the club or having dinner (maybe three times in the past year). 

We decided not to invite friend 3 for a couple of reasons:

	1.	I am closest with friend 3, but friend 1 and 2 aren’t. Since the trip was to celebrate friend 2, it didn’t make sense to invite friend 3 if she and friend 2 aren’t close. Friend 1 and friend 3 also don’t talk at all outside of our group outings.
	2.	Friend 3 doesn’t drink, but the rest of us do. We planned to go to bars and clubs, and we didn’t think friend 3 would have had a fun time since she doesn’t drink. She only participates in other party favors at the clubs. Not that it’s a bad thing, but I think it would be a little awkward for her if we are all drinking and she’s just there. 
	3.	Friend 2 and friend 3 almost moved in together around the time we planned the trip, but some drama happened, so that didn’t happen. Friend 2 and 3 seemed a little upset at each other after this. So, I chose not to include friend 3 since friend 2 didn’t seem happy with her, and as mentioned before, they aren’t close in the first place.

We came back from the trip to Miami a while ago, and friend 3 is clearly upset but won’t say anything. We’ve all met up once since then, and she was fine at first but then suddenly seemed really upset. It was like she flipped a switch and even gave me a crazy dirty look at the end of the night.

153,1ear3h7,AITA for not going to my friend’s wedding? As part of the groom’s party,"So I’m supposed to be part of my friend’s grooms party this November. We were best friends since freshman year of high school and we’re now both 31. After high school we definitely drifted a bit, especially after I moved away from the state. Over the past few years we only saw eachother 3 times and talked only occasionally. 

Now for where the problems really begin.

My friend has a long term girlfriend and is now engaged. As long as I can remember, he’s cheated on her. It seems like it’s at every chance he gets. 

A couple of months ago we had his bachelor party in a different country. I hadn’t seen him in over a year. I figured that maybe he’d have changed since he’s on the verge of getting married but no. He was cheating the whole time, and seemed like he was really trying to.

The first night, I’ll admit we were all drunk, but I brought up the idea that maybe it’s not the best idea to get married. (We had the conversation again when we were sober but it went in one ear and out the other.)

Why live with a lie for the rest of your life?When you get married, you’re essentially betting half of your money and assets that you won’t get caught. Do you want to live like that? You think she’s that stupid?

Not to mention he was extremely rude to the locals, which drove me crazy. He was very loud and obnoxious which clearly bothered other tourists in areas where people are just chillin. Speaking inappropriately around families etc. just an overall turnoff and embarrassing behavior to be around.

At the end of the first night, I blocked his phone number and was going to leave to enjoy the rest of my trip alone, but decided to stay the next morning. We communicated over WhatsApp during the trip so I didn’t realize that I had blocked him until after the trip, his fiancé messaged me, asking me to call him.

At that point, and even still, I didn’t care to unblock him. I feel like it’s a waste of money to go to the wedding. I also don’t want to stand on the altar and act like everything is ok when it’s all a big lie. 

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-24,"AITA for not going to my friend’s wedding? As part of the groom’s party So I’m supposed to be part of my friend’s grooms party this November. We were best friends since freshman year of high school and we’re now both 31. After high school we definitely drifted a bit, especially after I moved away from the state. Over the past few years we only saw eachother 3 times and talked only occasionally. 

Now for where the problems really begin.

My friend has a long term girlfriend and is now engaged. As long as I can remember, he’s cheated on her. It seems like it’s at every chance he gets. 

A couple of months ago we had his bachelor party in a different country. I hadn’t seen him in over a year. I figured that maybe he’d have changed since he’s on the verge of getting married but no. He was cheating the whole time, and seemed like he was really trying to.

My (19M) parents have always been protective over us especially my baby brother ""Danny"" (14M) because he's autistic. Danny has a boyfriend ""Carter"" (15M) and because my parents are usually working I usually end up being the one to drive them around and ""chaperone"" their dates or making sure they're not up to anything at home. I usually just leave them whereever and just stay in the area so I'm not third wheeling them.

Over the weekend they went to the movies and they wanted to watch some rate R horror movie.They told our parents and Carter's mom they were going to see something way more tame. I just payed for the tickets and then went and hung out with my girlfriend till they were ready. Everything seemed to be fine while dropping off Carter and taking Danny home. Yesterday my parents get an angry call from Carter's mom yelling about how we let Carter see a r rated horror movie and how he he gets nightmares and night terrors. She apparently has to wash his  wet bed sheets all week.

Hed apparently told her after the third time she caught him with wet sheets. My parents were pissed saying how irresponsible I was and for going on with the boys lie.

Before getting married I thought we would be looking for a home we could fit in with my two kids or he would move in with me. I work in the area where he lives which is about 45 minutes from my home. He owns a small 1 bedroom home but doesn't want to drive the 45 min to stay at my home. He is the director of a company and travels across the country periodically. He may stay with me five or six times a month if I'm lucky. I have two kids from previous relationships and he does great with them and will keep them for me some while I work but we have no family time together and if he does come over it's after 10 p.m. usually. 

I am so tired of his job hours and him constantly working and refusing to come to my home to see his family because of work. He will tell me no before he will tell his boss no. We had a vacation scheduled recently and he canceled it the day before due to a work trip he agreed to go on. Every time I get upset he throws it in my face that if I wasn't such a b*tch all the time maybe he'd want to be around me.

159,1eap9tc,AITA for trying to talk finances with my partner?,"My fiance and I are having a large disagreement over a financial conversation that came up recently, to which I need some unbiased insight.

I am currently making top dollar in my field of work and the area we live, while my partner has just finished school and begun work in a field with much higher earning potential, albeit starting out at almost exactly same salary as I am making now. My partner is prone to expensive tastes, spontaneous vacation planning and generally wanting to live life through experiences while I am a bit more conservative, but don't typically mind splurging on something so that we can do it together even if I think it would a better financial move to not go on this trip, buy this thing, and so on. I've finally started making some traction in terms of finances, savings, etc. and am trying my best to stay out of debt, while she now has $100k of student loans to deal with. She has expressed that she wants to remain separate financially while keeping a shared account for family expenses, bills, etc. that we both contribute to as the nature of our financial relationship through the years has been more or less 50/50. She has also made gracious comments in the past about her earning potential, along the lines of being generous.

I asked if then, in the future, does that mean we are living off of my budget and not yours? Does this mean that if you choose to take an expensive vacation that is out of my price range does that mean I am expected to go in to debt, stay home or would you assist in the cost so that we can do whatever the thing is together? She did not like that idea one bit and is now accusing me of being greedy, lazy, after her (hypothetical) money, and many other similar claims. I felt this was a genuine question to ask and am in no way only with her earning potential. We've been together for years and she has not made much the entire time up to this point. It really isn't a factor for me, but what is hurtful is I would think this to be a non-issue. Of course I want my partner with me, why wouldn't she? She is essentially taking the stance of, ""I went to school for years for this, I worked extremely hard for this, I am the woman, why shouldn't you just work harder. Why should I ever have to pay more than 50%.""

What is the take on this? I feel it was an important conversation to have, but we probably should have tackled it sooner. I grew up on the notion of ""household income"" although it was my father as the primary earner. It's not uncommon to have a wage inequality in a relationship.

162,1eaomtw,AITA after friends cancelled plans?,"Me, my bf and my bro are part of a friend group where we all met at comic con and now attend those together, go for drinks and get togethers etc.
This weekend we had a comic con on Sat & Sun, and had planned to have drinks together on Saturday after con and have a nice evening/night all together. This was planned in the group chat for a year for anyone who could make it. 

It only turned out us 3 and 2 others could make it. Person A & person B, who came over together as they’re very close friends. The actual comic con isn’t any good. The only reason us 3 came was because we did this same con & ‘afterparty’ last year and had a lot of fun in the after part.

A & B asked if we could stay the Friday night at the hotel we were all going to stay at, we found an airbnb instead that was cheaper and would allow us to be able to stay Friday night too so we did that. they then dropped out of Friday night.

Saturday, we ask if they’d like to come to the airbnb for drinks etc instead of their hotel, they said yes. (We were still happy to do it at hotel if not) 

they say let’s go for food together once we’ve gotten changed. They left to get ready at 4, we got back to our place at 4:30 and let them know that we’d be a little while, no response. 5:30 we’re ready and let them know. 6:00 they say they’ve been sat and done nothing since they got back, and for us to go for food without them, they’ll be round soon. 

We go get food and bring it back to eat so that we’re there and ready if they come round. I tell them. We hear nothing from them until 7:30 and they say they’re getting food. 8.30 asked for their ETA. 9:00 they say they’re tired and not coming. 

We’re annoyed. So we told them that it was a bit of a d*ck move and unfair. 

Person A sends a defensive and angry message about the fact she has a liver problem that makes her tired after food. She then leaves the group chat (consisting of only the attendees) without letting us say anything else. 

Sunday, we’re all feeling upset and don’t want to go to con. We only go to try find them and talk to them in person. We find them, and person A doesn’t even want to talk to us. We ask why we can’t just discuss this like adults 

Person A then says we changed all the plans by getting an airbnb and not telling them (we told them weeks ago, she just didn’t read the message). And that it’s not all about us. We told them it’s literally the whole point of the weekend and always has been. She also kept saying that we just don’t understand her liver problem. And we kept trying to explain we’re not upset at her feeling tired, or her liver, or her not wanting to come round. It’s the fact we had to pry for any sort of info of what’s happening. And their reaction since then has made us even more upset. 

Person A then storms off and leaves all group chats and that’s the end of it.

they won’t talk to us all I can do is have it all going around my head constantly brewing, and it’s making me wonder who’s the problem here. ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-24,"AITA after friends cancelled plans? Me, my bf and my bro are part of a friend group where we all met at comic con and now attend those together, go for drinks and get togethers etc.
This weekend we had a comic con on Sat & Sun, and had planned to have drinks together on Saturday after con and have a nice evening/night all together. This was planned in the group chat for a year for anyone who could make it. 

It only turned out us 3 and 2 others could make it. Person A & person B, who came over together as they’re very close friends. The actual comic con isn’t any good. The only reason us 3 came was because we did this same con & ‘afterparty’ last year and had a lot of fun in the after part.

A & B asked if we could stay the Friday night at the hotel we were all going to stay at, we found an airbnb instead that was cheaper and would allow us to be able to stay Friday night too so we did that. they then dropped out of Friday night.

Saturday, we ask if they’d like to come to the airbnb for drinks etc instead of their hotel, they said yes. (We were still happy to do it at hotel if not) 

they say let’s go for food together once we’ve gotten changed. They left to get ready at 4, we got back to our place at 4:30 and let them know that we’d be a little while, no response. 5:30 we’re ready and let them know. 6:00 they say they’ve been sat and done nothing since they got back, and for us to go for food without them, they’ll be round soon. 

We go get food and bring it back to eat so that we’re there and ready if they come round. I tell them. We hear nothing from them until 7:30 and they say they’re getting food. 8.30 asked for their ETA. 9:00 they say they’re tired and not coming. 

We’re annoyed. So we told them that it was a bit of a d*ck move and unfair. 

Person A sends a defensive and angry message about the fact she has a liver problem that makes her tired after food. She then leaves the group chat (consisting of only the attendees) without letting us say anything else. 

Sunday, we’re all feeling upset and don’t want to go to con. We only go to try find them and talk to them in person. We find them, and person A doesn’t even want to talk to us. We ask why we can’t just discuss this like adults 

Person A then says we changed all the plans by getting an airbnb and not telling them (we told them weeks ago, she just didn’t read the message). And that it’s not all about us. We told them it’s literally the whole point of the weekend and always has been. She also kept saying that we just don’t understand her liver problem. And we kept trying to explain we’re not upset at her feeling tired, or her liver, or her not wanting to come round. It’s the fact we had to pry for any sort of info of what’s happening. And their reaction since then has made us even more upset. 

Person A then storms off and leaves all group chats and that’s the end of it.

163,1eaohh9,WIBTA if I refused to go to the gym with my sister after hearing her talk behind my back?,"I (19F) and my sister (30F) started going to the gym together for the past two weeks. I’m not the most active person mainly due to laziness. My mom has been urging my sister to take me to the gym, so I finally decided to go with her as I know it would be good for my health and make my mom happy. We have been going consistently three times a week, hitting legs, arms, abs, and doing cardio. I also work at a coffee shop 3-4 times a week, so on my days off, we go to the gym.

On Sunday, I had work but we had plans to go to the gym after. I was feeling extremely exhausted and needed to study for an exam once I got home, so I asked if it was okay if I skipped our gym session. She said it was fine but asked me to take her to a different city to pick up her car, which she left at a friend’s house the night before when she came home drunk. She ended up forcing me to take her once I got home from my shift, despite being exhausted. 

The next day, I had plans with my boyfriend for breakfast and texted my sister saying I would go to the gym myself that night instead. She replied, “You know if you actually want to lose weight you have to take it more serious.” I said I know and mentioned that my diet has been relatively good the past few weeks.

I know this is horrible timing, but I got food poisoning that day from something I ate the day before. I was feeling sick and miserable and couldn’t go to the gym. Today, I had work from 6:30-3, and I planned on calling out but was scared of getting written up or terminated due to my workplace's strict policy on callouts. I ended up leaving early due to stomach issues.

My sister asked if I went to the gym yesterday, and I said no due to food poisoning, which she seemed fine with. However, later at dinner, my dad asked my sister if we’ve been going to the gym. She replied, “No, she keeps making excuses. Yesterday we were supposed to go, but she said something came up and decided to hang out with her boyfriend. Then today, nothing.” My dad responded, “Well, today she has food poisoning and she even had to leave work early because of it. That’s probably why,” and my sister was silent.

I’m wondering if I was supposed to go to the gym with her when I was feeling physically ill. We never made plans to go today, so I don’t know why she mentioned that. Would it be wrong to tell her I won’t go to the gym with her anymore because I heard her talking behind my back? Am I overreacting? Maybe a little, but the situation rubbed me the wrong way. I only canceled twice, once due to poor planning and the other due to food poisoning. I wish she was more understanding.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-24,"WIBTA if I refused to go to the gym with my sister after hearing her talk behind my back?
