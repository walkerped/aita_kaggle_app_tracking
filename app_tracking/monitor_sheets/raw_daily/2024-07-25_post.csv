0,1ec008s,AITA for requiring a girlfriend to move to me for a relationship?,"So for backstory, one of friends who I am considering a relationship with lives really far away in southern Florida. I live in Northern Indiana. We both agree that if we get into a relationship it canâ€™t stay long distance, and one of us will have to move towards the other. This is a huge thing to accomplish so we both feel we will need to compromise in someway. Now I absolutely cannot move to Florida. Itâ€™s too much for me. As a lesbian and a trans woman I already donâ€™t feel too safe where I live, and I would feel extremely unsafe in Florida. Iâ€™ve expressed this concern to her and she says that Iâ€™m trying to guilt trip her into moving so I donâ€™t have to give up my friendships. I do feel really bad as Iâ€™m almost forcing her to move to me if we wanna be in a relationship. But I absolutely could not stand the thought of living in Florida and having to oppress my true self just to feel slightly safe. However my friend, she is extremely mad, will barely talk to me, and thinks Iâ€™m being awful. Am I the asshole here?",POO Mode Activated ðŸ’©,2024-07-25,"AITA for requiring a girlfriend to move to me for a relationship?

1,1ebqxrv,AITA for telling my boyfriend his poop wasnâ€™t green?,"Iâ€™m not sure entirely where to start so Iâ€™ll try to set the upcoming scene.

I am 23 (F) and my boyfriend is 27 (M), We have two young children together and have been together for years. I work full time and also do all of the household cleaning and more than half of the cooking. I am solely responsible for grocery shopping, caring for the kids, and anything in between. He contributes financially at times. 

Over the last few months he has had really bad stomach issues, weâ€™re talking liquid diarrhea. He NEVER cleans the toilet after so itâ€™s streaked with runs of poop all over the inside, the back of the toilet, under the toilet seat, and honestly sometimes the walls. Iâ€™ve been very patient with him and since I do the cleaning I am typically scrubbing his slimy shit off the toilet. Sometimes I have to actually scrape it off because he does it when I am not home, so by the time I get home itâ€™s fully dried and stuck to the toilet and walls. Iâ€™ve asked him to please flush several times, and maybe try to aim in the actual toilet? Iâ€™ve had some close calls myself but Iâ€™ve never fully shit on any other surface in the bathroom. He always gets annoyed and tries to say it wasnâ€™t him, when I know itâ€™s him. 

Anyway, last night is what really tipped me over the edge. I got home from work and detailed cleaned both of our bathrooms. Top to bottom it was spotless. Then I heard my boyfriend scuttling to the bathroom, I reminded him I literally just cleaned it so if he poops all over the toilet to please just clean it. I left the toilet brush out, Clorox wipes on the counter, and even febreeze for good measure. He was in there for probably an hour, and I did hear a lot of disturbing noises but I was hopeful he would simply take what I said to heart. After he finished I let the air settle a bit then I went in to check. I know this might sound childish but Iâ€™m so tired of cleaning up poop. I take a look at the toilet and it has poop sprays all over the inside and along the upper part of the actual seat. The seat that I sit on has poop on it. I call him in and ask him to please clean up his mess. He got incredibly offended and annoyed. He tried to tell me that poop on the toilet was yellow and his poop was actually green. I explain to him he was the only person in this bathroom and he literally just pooped, I heard the whole thing. He refused to clean it and called me insane for assuming it was his poop. Telling me I donâ€™t even know my colors. 

Long story short I was pretty frustrated and cleaned all the poop up again. I told him that I was fed up with cleaning up after a grown adult, especially their poop. Am I the asshole for asking him to not poop all over the toilet, and am I the asshole for explaining to him it was in fact his poop regardless of his color expectations?",POO Mode Activated ðŸ’©,2024-07-25,"AITA for telling my boyfriend his poop wasnâ€™t green?
