0,1ec008s,AITA for requiring a girlfriend to move to me for a relationship?,"So for backstory, one of friends who I am considering a relationship with lives really far away in southern Florida. I live in Northern Indiana. We both agree that if we get into a relationship it can’t stay long distance, and one of us will have to move towards the other. This is a huge thing to accomplish so we both feel we will need to compromise in someway. Now I absolutely cannot move to Florida. It’s too much for me. As a lesbian and a trans woman I already don’t feel too safe where I live, and I would feel extremely unsafe in Florida. I’ve expressed this concern to her and she says that I’m trying to guilt trip her into moving so I don’t have to give up my friendships. I do feel really bad as I’m almost forcing her to move to me if we wanna be in a relationship. But I absolutely could not stand the thought of living in Florida and having to oppress my true self just to feel slightly safe. However my friend, she is extremely mad, will barely talk to me, and thinks I’m being awful.

1,1ebqxrv,AITA for telling my boyfriend his poop wasn’t green?,"I’m not sure entirely where to start so I’ll try to set the upcoming scene.

I am 23 (F) and my boyfriend is 27 (M), We have two young children together and have been together for years. I work full time and also do all of the household cleaning and more than half of the cooking. I am solely responsible for grocery shopping, caring for the kids, and anything in between. He contributes financially at times. 

Over the last few months he has had really bad stomach issues, we’re talking liquid diarrhea. He NEVER cleans the toilet after so it’s streaked with runs of poop all over the inside, the back of the toilet, under the toilet seat, and honestly sometimes the walls. I’ve been very patient with him and since I do the cleaning I am typically scrubbing his slimy shit off the toilet. Sometimes I have to actually scrape it off because he does it when I am not home, so by the time I get home it’s fully dried and stuck to the toilet and walls. I’ve asked him to please flush several times, and maybe try to aim in the actual toilet? I’ve had some close calls myself but I’ve never fully shit on any other surface in the bathroom. He always gets annoyed and tries to say it wasn’t him, when I know it’s him. 

Anyway, last night is what really tipped me over the edge. I got home from work and detailed cleaned both of our bathrooms. Top to bottom it was spotless. Then I heard my boyfriend scuttling to the bathroom, I reminded him I literally just cleaned it so if he poops all over the toilet to please just clean it. I left the toilet brush out, Clorox wipes on the counter, and even febreeze for good measure. He was in there for probably an hour, and I did hear a lot of disturbing noises but I was hopeful he would simply take what I said to heart. After he finished I let the air settle a bit then I went in to check. I know this might sound childish but I’m so tired of cleaning up poop. I take a look at the toilet and it has poop sprays all over the inside and along the upper part of the actual seat. The seat that I sit on has poop on it. I call him in and ask him to please clean up his mess. He got incredibly offended and annoyed. He tried to tell me that poop on the toilet was yellow and his poop was actually green. I explain to him he was the only person in this bathroom and he literally just pooped, I heard the whole thing. He refused to clean it and called me insane for assuming it was his poop. Telling me I don’t even know my colors. 

Long story short I was pretty frustrated and cleaned all the poop up again. I told him that I was fed up with cleaning up after a grown adult, especially their poop.

2,1ec9xtp,AITA for not helping my younger sister just because she has Cancer?,"Okay so before the story I want to give background. Our dad is pacific islander, and our mom is just white. My sister (14) and I (17) were both born in the US. Our parents divorced when I was six I think. However I continued to live my dad until I was 11, whereas my sister stayed with my mom. I live with my mom now because my dad wanted to move back to the islands, but I didn't want to leave my friends. However I know much of my family who still do live on the islands, and keep in touch with my 'roots' I guess. This is mostly thanks to my dad. My sister doesn't. Okay so onto the story.

About four months ago my sister was diagnosed with Sarcoma which is like a kind of bone/tissue cancer. She's had to go through a lot of procedures and spend a lot of time at the hospital, and I've spent a lot of it with her and helping her, and while I don't mind helping her, when she did get diagnosed my Mom expected me to drop literally everything to be there to help her. Meaning if she's at the hospital, I'm at the hospital. If she's undergoing a surgery or 'stressful procedure' I have to stop everything I'm doing (including school) and sit in the waiting room as support.

But all that I could handle and it was annoying but whatever. However recently the doctors finally decided they wanted to do Chemo, and my sisters hair has begun to fall out. She shaved it, but is extremely upset about it, because she really loved her hair. The other day my mom suggested that I shave my own hair so a wig can be made out of it for her. For reference my hair goes down to below my butt. However the thing is you're only supposed to cut your hair when a family member dies, and it's a tradition my entire family (dad's side) upholds. And to be frank, I like my hair and have no desire to shave it, as I have been growing it out since I was a kid.

I explained this to both my sister and my mom, but both are instant that I should do it, and that a tradition like that is meaningless, especially since my sister might die anyways. I told them no. They've both asked several times more, and my sister even begging. I once again reiterated why I wouldn't, and that asking me too was insulting.

Now my sister is upset and saying that I obviously don't actually care that she's struggling and aren't being understanding. However I've bent over backwards for her, so the fact she's going so far hurts. But she's also never asked me of anything like this before and is really upset, so I just don't know, AITA??",Not the A-hole,2024-07-25,"AITA for not helping my younger sister just because she has Cancer?

3,1ec9s01,AITA:for sending a list of things my brother needs to clean before my friends arrive to hang out and if he doesn’t do it within time I’ll clean it but send him a cleaning bill? ,"My brother and I are living with my parents(financial reasons), my parents are away on a very long vacation(two months) and it is up to my brother and I to look after the apartment and our family dog. I’ve lived like this before just my brother and I and wanted to pull my hair out because I can’t stand how unclean he can be. Just an fyi by brother is one year younger than me and we are in our late 20’s 
I’m quite a clean person, I like to clean up after my self. What I don’t like is to clean up after people that don’t help around the house. This summer I made a chore sheet that “split” the responsibilities down the middle, for example, I clean the kitchen sink, stove, fridge, vaccume kitchen floor, look after the recycling bin and normal bin, wash bed sheets, towels, water all the plants in the apartment(20), brush my dogs teeth everynight(he has dental problems) and wipe down surfaces while my brother feeds the dog once a day(roam eater), empties the dish washer and vacuums apartment. We both have one bathroom to look after. 

Now the problem has arisen that I am having friends over and would like the apartment to look clean so instead of asking him in person( because I get attitude when I do) I sent him a series of photos of messes he has made that I would like him to tidy before my friends arrive. I told him if it’s not done before they come I will do it my self but will charge him a cleaning fee because I don’t do that shit for free. He got mad saying i ask way too much of him and I’m too much of a neat freak.

I know people will ask what are the things I sent that he needs to clean up are: his clothes are not in the laundry hamper but on the floor of the laundry room, he cleaned the lint holder for the drier in the sink and left the sink clogged with lint, left his bandage wrapper on the entrance table, didn’t put away clean bed sheets(I washed for him), hasn’t thrown away his stale bread or the empty dog food bag, left bowl and pan in sink instead of dishwasher, left  his cup and bowl on the coffee table, hasn’t put clean garlic press he used and washed away , and lastly hasn’t put away washed ziplock bag. 

I have given him plenty of warning my friends are coming(72 hours), the things I sent him is his own mess that have been left out for over a week. I have held back from telling him these things before because I wanted to let him do it in his own time but now there is a time limit. So am I the asshole?

6,1ec8jap,AITA for buying my little brother's favorite game and not letting him play?,"I, (at the time 16f) had just recently had my 16th birthday, one of the gifts I received was a two gift cards for one store, adding up to about 40 dollars in total. About month later I decided to finally use it to by Minecraft for my switch. (Yeah ik Minecraft on the switch is lame but thats besides the point) I had Minecraft before, on my tablet when I was around 10 or 11, I loved the game and was extremely happy and passionate about making my own builds and letting my creativity take course, so I decided to buy it again. Although I also knew my brother (7m) was extremely into Minecraft, going as far as to play some extremely horrible rip off of it on his own tablet. At the time I thought me and him could take turns playing it every once in awhile, But once I got the game, I was practically hooked. I had started building a whole detailed neighborhood with an underlying love sick story, along with a separate map with a highschool.  I didn't want to really share because he wanted to play on my world, which required a split screen. I hated the lag it caused and the constant random stuff he would do especially without my permission, break my builds, constantly harass me to help him build his house- which he put no effort in, and complain how I have better building experience then him, and drop different items onto me so I either find them later on or get them in my inventory. Even still, he and I played together for about a week. After awhile he would start yelling at me for being on the game without him and would forcibly hook up his controllers even when I tell him not to. And when I tell him no, he suddenly turns to the parents and complains how I'm a horrible sister for not letting him play. Hell within the first week my dad threatened to just throw away the game from how many arguments it started. I even vividly remember my dad asking what I was doing in my room and to which I replied ""drawing"" which i was on my desk which faced away from the tv.  My brother then yells ""NO SHE WASN'T"" and takes out my switch screen from the dock and presents it, which still had the game running because I had fell asleep the previous night without shutting it off while my tv did shut off. I didn't get in trouble for this but it still filled me with rage. 

So, am I the asshole for this?

My grandma begins to berate me saying “well why didn’t you say this before he started eating!” After that comment I began to get a little annoyed so I was snippy with my response and said “well it’s not like all of the icing made is on that singular piece of cake.” That’s when all hell began to break loose. My grandma and uncle both begin to berate me together saying that I should’ve known better than to serve him a piece of cake (which I didn’t do considering I just made it and he again, willingly SERVED HIMSELF) and that I should have spoken sooner to let him know how much sugar was in the icing (4 cups of powdered sugar in case you’re curious). After this I completely snapped saying “aren’t you the same people that allow my cousin to yell at me for being allergic to peanuts, continuously downplay my fatal allergy that nearly killed me, and also eat peanuts in my house without a care in the world, which then results in me having an allergic reactions?” They were pretty silent after I said that, but I also didn’t give them that long of a chance to respond because I left the dining room to get away.

8,1ec8gsr,AITA for messing up my friendship ,"my two friends recently ended their friendship with me. let's call them joe and bob. so there are a few reasons as to why they decided to end it. 



firstly, when we were at the mall one day, joe went up to a guy and asked for his number. he said yes and gave his number. when this happened, i was super happy for her and hyping her up. they texted and snapped for a while but nothing too serious. about a week later we decided to do a ""loyalty test"" on the guy from the mall. so i started texting they guy through my phone. also keep in mind that both joe and bob were completely fine with me doing this. a few months go by and joe confronts me saying that i never should've texted the guy and it made her feel really uncomfortable. she also told me that i shouldn't have been snapping him because it felt wrong. obviously i apologized to her and i told her that after that day we did the ""test"" i never texted him and i unadded him on snap after a while (we did snap.) she told me that she was really mad and what i did was really messed up. i wanted to ask her why she didn't tell me this the day we decided to do the test since she seemed completely fine with it. and now she brings it up after months. 



moving on. secondly, bob used to like this guy and we all knew about it. occasionally the guy bob likes would text me and joe (in a friendly way) and we would send screenshots of it to bob so she doesn't feel left out. anyways last december he texted me and we have a few casual convos (again, friendly way) and i told joe about this but not bob. so a few weeks later joe decided to tell bob that he texted me. when bob heard this she was really upset and mad. they confronted me about this through text and told me that what i did of not telling her was messed up and broke ""girl code."" i completely acknowledged my mistake and apologised to the both of them. after this they stopped talking to me for a month and started talking to me again. 



thirdly, i have avoidant attachment so when i get close to someone i feel like they would leave me so i ghost them for a while (i know it's weird) so sometimes i would ghost joe and bob and then come back texting them again. they confronted me about this a few times and i said i would not do it again so i finally stopped. 



it's been almost a month since we talked and yesterday they called me telling me everything i've done to them and just completely lashing out on me. anytime i would try to speak they would cut me off and add on to the list of things i have done. what i really don't get is that it was about half of the stuff we already solved before and i apologised numerous times and the rest of the stuff were from months ago, so i don't understand why they just didn't confront me about that then. anyways, they told me that if we tried to be friends again we lost our spark so it wouldn't work out. 



i understand that the things i did was very wrong. but should of joe and bob accepted my apology and forgave me for my mistakes?

The first month was a little tough to make friends who I hung out with outside of work but I managed to be really close with John 24M. Me and John would hang out a lot and I knew he had a crush on me but I told him we were platonic and he respected that. 

I met Kara 25F through another friend at work and she told me people were mean to her and nobody liked her, so I decided to hang out with her. She was your basic sanrio girl who likes everything cute. We hung out a lot but sometimes her anxiety would get the best of her and I would try to help her. The one thing that made me upset is she didn't like hanging out in a group with John. She told me he made her uncomfortable and normally I would not invite him but nobody else had a problem with him except her.

A couple months later Johns ex invited him to go out and he wanted to bring me and another friend so it wasn't award, this was two weeks before Kara needed off the same day. She asked me a couple days before if I could and I told her I had plans. She found out all three of us hung out with out her and flipped on only me.

We own a house together and pretty much live like a married couple.

This year he has been sleeping in, turning off his multiple alarms in the morning and complaining about going to work, which I get it sucks and one hour travel is not fun. I’m a morning person and I get up pretty early, at around 4:30-5am so I can take my time getting ready for work to leave at 7am, it also takes me an hour to get to work but I don’t have a car so I catch a couple of buses which means I don’t have any time allowances and have to leave on time to make my bus. 

Sometimes when I’m up in the morning, if I notice the time and realise Leo needs to get up, I will go and wake him up. 60% of the time he says “Nah I can’t be f***ed going in early, I’ll leave at 6am” and he’ll go back to sleep.

I feel like it’s not fair to put the blame on me, it’s not my job to wake him up every morning and when I remember to, I do, but sometimes I have other things on my mind while I’m getting my own self ready for work.

She does not have children of her own yet. She was very happy for me and did everything she could to support me during my pregnancy.

Things went wrong and I ended up giving birth a week early. She’s still out of town, I insisted she stay there, and she calls frequently to say hi. My baby is very premature and has to stay in the NICU, I just had major surgery and the pregnancy hormones are hitting me real hard.

16,1ec7pzc,AITA for not going on Vacation with my dad who was never around?,"I 21(F) grew up with my mom 53 (F). My biological father refused to be in the picture from the start. I now have a 3 year old girl with my fiance 22 (M). My mother is very supportive of us and very helpful if either of us needs to work late.

I am a intern at a hospital. I am studying to be a surgeon, one day a woman came in that had been in a serious car crash. My senior resident put me on the case and I realized this woman had a last name exactly like my fathers. At the time I didn't think anything of it. After the woman came out of surgery (I can't disclose this information of what it was for and from) I saw my father in the waiting room. I walked into the waiting room and out loud said the paitents name. My father looked up and said ""Yes. That's my wife."". As soon as that came out of his mouth it hurt all over.

I explained the situation and about how stable she was and if she was going to be ok or not. As I am about to walk away two men walk into the room and over to where we were standing. These men turned out to be my **older** half brothers. Eventually his wife left the hospital and everything went fine. Not even a week after the woman was out of the hospital my father showed up and requested to see me. He thanked me for saving his wife and handed me flowers. At that point I broke down into tears. He said that it was ok and shes fine. I then had to cover up the reason I was crying and said ""No one has ever thanked me."". He left still not having a clue I was his daughter.

I told my mom everything that had happened and she reached out to my father. Asking if he would like to see me and possibly meet his grand-daughter. He figured that would be ok and came over the following week. Instead of coming alone like planned he showed up with his wife. My mom acted like nothing was wrong and played with my daughter. I talked to my father and his wife (Who I refuse to call anything but her name). A little background information: I wear glasses and my hair up to work, so my father didn't recognize me **at all** when he visited.

We all ate dinner together but then the hospital paged me. My mom said she would take my daughter to her house after she cleaned the kitchen. My father the whole time didn't ask my profession, He was so shocked to see me come downstairs with my glasses and hair up. He actually gasped when I came downstairs. He said that this was really awkward for him now and that him and his wife should get going.

I went to work and a couple of weeks later I decided I would take a week off of work. My mom started to build a relationship with my fathers wife and word got to him I was taking vacation the same time as his family was going to Fiji for vacation. I ended up getting an invite for my fiance and daughter. I refuse to accept it. I think my father only wants to be in my life now for my daughter and the fact I saved his wife. AITA for not accepting his offer? (Sorry for mis-spelling I typed fast)",Not the A-hole,2024-07-25,"AITA for not going on Vacation with my dad who was never around? I 21(F) grew up with my mom 53 (F). My biological father refused to be in the picture from the start. I now have a 3 year old girl with my fiance 22 (M). My mother is very supportive of us and very helpful if either of us needs to work late.

I am a intern at a hospital. I am studying to be a surgeon, one day a woman came in that had been in a serious car crash. My senior resident put me on the case and I realized this woman had a last name exactly like my fathers. At the time I didn't think anything of it. After the woman came out of surgery (I can't disclose this information of what it was for and from) I saw my father in the waiting room. I walked into the waiting room and out loud said the paitents name. My father looked up and said ""Yes. That's my wife."". As soon as that came out of his mouth it hurt all over.

I explained the situation and about how stable she was and if she was going to be ok or not. As I am about to walk away two men walk into the room and over to where we were standing. These men turned out to be my **older** half brothers. Eventually his wife left the hospital and everything went fine. Not even a week after the woman was out of the hospital my father showed up and requested to see me. He thanked me for saving his wife and handed me flowers. At that point I broke down into tears. He said that it was ok and shes fine. I then had to cover up the reason I was crying and said ""No one has ever thanked me."". He left still not having a clue I was his daughter.

I told my mom everything that had happened and she reached out to my father. Asking if he would like to see me and possibly meet his grand-daughter. He figured that would be ok and came over the following week. Instead of coming alone like planned he showed up with his wife. My mom acted like nothing was wrong and played with my daughter. I talked to my father and his wife (Who I refuse to call anything but her name). A little background information: I wear glasses and my hair up to work, so my father didn't recognize me **at all** when he visited.

We all ate dinner together but then the hospital paged me. My mom said she would take my daughter to her house after she cleaned the kitchen. My father the whole time didn't ask my profession, He was so shocked to see me come downstairs with my glasses and hair up. He actually gasped when I came downstairs. He said that this was really awkward for him now and that him and his wife should get going.

17,1ec7kc2,AITA for escalating to the manager?,"I (24F) went on vacation with my boyfriend and two of my friends and their partners to a resort town somewhere near upper Klamath lake.  My friends and I decided to explore the town's offerings while our partners went off to do outdoorsy activities.

We stopped by this cafe and I was talking about setting up a winter vacation to Boston since I have family there. We wait for our drinks and then our drinks are called when I'm talking about the loose plans for the boston trip. The server (male in late 20s) interjects and says ""If you're going to Boston I don't think you should go to the Liberty Bell."" I say I wasn't planning to and try to grab my drink.

The drink spills a bit then I call the manager and say ""This guy's holding my drink hostage and ranting about the Liberty Bell.""

The manager, an older man, takes the drink out of the worker's hands and asks what he was thinking.

I roll my eyes and we pick out a new dessert store and I say that the service there was better because my drink wasn't being held hostage. My friend again says ""Oblivious, not hostage.""

18,1ec7hm9,AITA for telling off my parents for giving my young kids a hard time about speaking a foreign language in front of them?,"Burner for privacy. I am American. My wife is from a foreign country, though she did her post-secondary studies in the US.  She comes from a small country, the language of which is not widely spoken elsewhere.  Once our relationship got serious, I decided to learn her language.  I’ve always had an interest in languages and a facility for learning them (I speak two others besides English and my wife’s).  With her and her family’s help, I’ve become near-fluent!   When we had kids (twin boys, 8), we decided to raise them to speak both languages, partly so they could communicate more easily with their relatives on my wife’s side and partly as a way to keep them connected to m wife’s culture.  A few years ago, we bought a small vacation property in my wife’ country, where we spend a couple of weeks each summer, which has both helped my and my kids’ facility with the language and has in turn been made more enjoyable *because* we all speak the language.

For reasons I can’t quite get to the bottom of, this has always seemed to irritate my parents.  They were sour about the fact that some of the toasts at our wedding were in my wife’s language (we translated).  My mother, a former teacher, claimed that attempting to raise the kids bilingual risked causing language delays generally.  I told them that I appreciated their concern, but that we had done our research and felt like it would be good for the kids, but they kept bringing it up for the first few years of the kids lives, until it was clear they were both highly precocious in verbal skills. 

These days, we speak a mix of both languages at home.  The kids will often speak to each other in wife’s language, often preferentially so when they are just sorting something between themselves.  The problem is that my parents get annoyed when they hear it.  They justify it on multiple grounds, all flimsy in my view: that if they are watching the kids, they need to know what they are talking about in order to properly supervise; that they could be using it as a “secret language” to say disrespectful things; that if we allow it with them, they’ll do it at school and anger teachers or peers.  It’s never proved a problem for anyone but my parents.

Parents were over recently and one kid spoke to the other in the foreign language. I was in the other room and heard my mom gently reprove them to the effect of “it’s rude to speak in a language we can’t understand; I need to tell you this because you’re parents won’t.”  At that point I had enuogh and I stormed in and told my parents that they need to drop it.  They can have lots of 95% English time with their grandkids, or they can insist on 100% English and have 95% less time.  My dad got upset and said that they were only looking out for the kids because we have a “blind spot” about this and that I should apologize to my mother.  I rolled my eyes and said “sorry” in my wife’s language, which got a laugh out of my kids, but caused my parents to up and leave.  AITA?

My parents both want me to go, but there's something that they don't agree on. My mother wants me to study outside of the city (or even in a different country) but my dad thinks that I'm not ready. He wants me to stay and enroll in a nearby university, so choosing one has been a little bit of trouble.

I don't resent either of them, but recently even the smallest of actions have resulted in one of them thinking I'm picking a side, which makes me feel like I'm walking on eggshells. After my results came in, we received a list of universities that could possibly accept an application from me. Later the same day, my dad asked me why I hadn't told him about what choices I made and that I only cared about my mother's opinion, so I told him that I hadn't chosen anything yet. I wanted to take my time and do some research, so after getting a brief idea of which universities I'd be interested in, I went to sleep.

Suddenly, my mother woke me up in the middle of the night to tell me that my father refused to eat dinner and left the house, and that he was angry at me. She asked me exactly what I said to him, so I told her the same thing, that I hadn't made my choice yet. After answering her questions I went back to sleep. The next day, my mother asked me to explain myself to my father to resolve things between us. Unfortunately it went wrong. He told me that I didn't have to explain myself and to leave him alone, then asked me to leave and shut the door behind me. I wanted to say something, but I couldn't get my voice to come out, so I simply left. Once again, he didn't come to have dinner with us. My mom attempted to comfort me and told me to try again the next day, and so I did.

This time, my mom had asked me to apologize and tell him that she's no longer getting involved with these matters, that he should help me choose on his own. I asked her why she couldn't tell him herself, and she told me that she currently doesn't talk to him. i found it understandable, i mean, it wasn't the first time this happened. So I walked into my dad's room, and apologized for making him feel left out. Unfortunately, he didn't accept my apology and told me that I wasn't treating him with enough respect, and that what our family needs is more gatherings to actually share our thoughts. I didn't disagree with that, but it still kind of upset me that my apology wasn't accepted. I didn't talk back to him, and I constantly apologized for hurting his feelings, so I don't know what I did wrong. 

I understand why he is upset and I've been trying to see things from his perspective, but I still don't quite understand him, even though I really want to.

We will normally goof around when we meet and play video games. He said he enjoyed my home because it was welcoming and he could decompress when he was stress (we only been to my house).

He was the first friend I ever invited to my house in my life. we have been talking for a few months before this and when you talk to him he is literally uncle from avatar the last air bender. We will normally goof around when we meet and play video games. He said he enjoyed my home because it was welcoming and he could decompress when he was stress (we only been to my house). When final exams were coming up I was catching up and redoing work to get the best grade, he kept wanting to hang out but I let brushing him off because i was struggling in this one class. 

I promised to hang out during the summer but during the last week I didn’t see him. I passed and I texted him but got no reply for days, later I was walking to the gym and knocked on his door to check on him. His dad opened the door, keep in mind I am a 6”3” Black Male and I rarely get intimidated by other men, this man’s presence made me feel small and he was towering over me. I swear my voice was getting Higher, I lost all testosterone in my voice when talking to him. He wasn’t mean, he was kind and said Rob had “an incident” and is in a mental hospital but didn’t specify, I knew he had some mental stuff but not much about it, later his mom replied using robs number and said the same thing. They said he would be back in June but as of today I haven’t seen him. Should I be worried? I want to check on him again but I god damn his dad is intimidating as hell.

24,1ec6btw,WIBTAH if I call in a noise complaint on my neighbors son who has a disability ,"I feel horrible even writing this, but I am starting to lose my mind. I live in a sub division that is backed up to another residential road. There is a family that lives behind my house on the main road that our sub division stems from and ever since the summer started, they literally lock their son outside ALL DAY, sometimes until 10 at night and I am not exaggerating when I say he is screaming the entire day. He has noise cancelling headphones on and is typically just sitting on his back porch, screaming. He looks emotionless. It is concerning that he’s out there all day every day in the heat. And he is yelling so loud we can hear him in our house. I wake up to the sound of him screaming at 8AM at least 4 days a week and it’s already very hard to sleep. 

I am reaching a boiling point because I am 21 weeks pregnant and my husband, son and I all have Flu A which has been miserable. We have horrible headaches and body shakes. We just want to rest but it’s impossible because all we can hear from our bedroom is this kid screaming. I can hear it from my living room as I’m typing this. I have never thought about complaining about the noise until today. I just want to sleep. I was released from the hospital less than 24 hours ago and I am dying to just get some sleep. 


The parents are NEVER outside with this kid. I am concerned for him and now I am concerned that I won’t get any rest during one of the worst sicknesses I’ve ever had to have while pregnant. 

Would I be the ass hole if I call in a noise complaint or a wellness check? 

EDIT: I did call in a wellness check but the police didn’t do anything because he is inside (likely eating dinner as it’s 6 pm here). They advised that I call CPS if this persists and that I record videos of the yelling. I do have some recorded but I plan on getting some videos early in the morning and past 9pm.  

Another edit: I am sorry that I didn’t come off as more compassionate to the child in this post. It has been months of this behavior and I have always tried to be patient and not judge this family or assume the worst, but at this point something has got to be wrong because I can’t fathom leaving my child out like this every day in the heat. I have been concerned for this child since the beginning but I understand the difficulties of raising a disabled child and I don’t know what resources this family has used or could use. Please forgive me, again I’m fresh out of the hospital with a bad fever and the worst flu I’ve ever had WHILE being pregnant with complications. I truly don’t mean to come off like I don’t care about this poor kid.

26,1ec5ryz,WIBTA if I went on vacation without my husband?,"Update: Thank you everyone for your input!
I talked with my husband more and told him I was feeling conflicted. He reassured me and encouraged me to go on the trip. He reminded me of how he went on a couple week-long trips alone a couple years ago too. I wasn't able to go because I was in school at the time, but I didn't want him to stay home from a trip just because I couldn't come, and I didn't get upset that he went without me. Likewise, he doesn't want me to stay home from a trip just because he can't come. So I'm going to go ahead and go on the trip. 

It was especially good to hear from people who have gone on solo trips without their spouses and had no issues. However, I still appreciated the input from people who are against the idea. Every person is different and every relationship is different, and what might work for one couple might not work for another couple, and that is totally okay :) 



Hello everyone. 

My (25f) husband (28m) broke his leg back in May. Originally we were planning to go on vacation near the end of July to visit another married couple that we're friends with. They live in another state. However, while my husband's leg is healing well, it is taking a while to heal.

We were planning on driving, but my husband thinks that the long drive would be too uncomfortable on his leg. That is likely because the drive takes two days, about 10 hours each day. 
Unfortunately flying is not an option because tickets from where we live are very expensive, and it would be too expensive to buy two tickets.

However, while it would be too expensive to buy plane tickets for both me and my husband, I would be able to afford to buy a ticket for myself to go visit our friends, without my husband. I would be gone for a week.

I would like to see these friends, as we can only see each other once a year due to work, school, and the extreme weather conditions during the winter where my husband and I live, which makes travel out of the state nearly impossible during the winter. 
It wouldn't be the end of the world if I couldn't see these friends this year, but I would definitely like to, if possible.

I am wondering if I would be the a-hole for going without my husband. I already asked my husband, and he said he is completely okay with me going without him. He and I are always very open with each other, so I know he is telling the truth. He is also able to take care of himself on his own. But I still feel pretty bad at the thought of leaving him behind. So what do you think? Would I be the a-hole for going on vacation for a week without my husband? ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-25,"WIBTA if I went on vacation without my husband?

27,1ec5oqo,WIBTA if I fired my bridesmaid?,"
My friend, Maria, has been my friend for about 7 years (we met in 2018) We weren’t super close when we first met but always friendly, then around 2020ish when her relationship started to fall apart we got very close and I supported her a lot. We hung out every weekend for months and eventually I helped her end the toxic relationship she was in. We were pretty inseparable at that time. Whilst she was single we continued to be friends until one day she meets a guy around the end of 2021, he lived about 1hr away from us so she spent a lot of time travelling to see him but I was genuinely just happy that she was happy and didn’t mind that we were spending less time together. 

It started to get weird when she began to get annoyed and upset at me for continuing to hang out with mutual friends (people she had introduced me to) when she was out of town. All the plans we made were in a group chat that she was in so she could see them being made but that also meant she was invited to everything we did but she chose to be with her partner instead. Lots of comments were made in a half joking half serious way about how it was a mistake to ever introduce us and how in her head we all just stop existing when she’s not around. I put this down to her own anxiety and continued to do what I could to make her feel included but the comments never stopped and we began to grow apart again.

For the last year or so I’ve seen her a bit more than I did in 2022 when she was busy with her partner, they live together now so they have more time and it’s been nice as long as I hang out with her one on one. If we hang out with the mutual friends previously mentioned the comments about how she’s no longer part of the group start again and it’s really exhausting. But the one on one time has largely been nice so I’ve felt a bit closer to her again. 

So now we’re at the present day, wedding is one year away and I asked the girls to be my bridesmaids about 2 months ago. Maria was excited when I asked but I have since had ZERO enthusiasm from her. I managed to find the most amazing wedding dress in a vintage store and she hasn’t replied to the photo I sent in the bridesmaid chat, everyone else said it was stunning etc etc but nothing. I organised a “get to know each other” drinks for my bridesmaids a few weeks back which I had to chase her for an answer on and I could see she was reading my messages. Surprise surprise, she didn’t show. Since she became my bridesmaid I’ve had four different friends tell me that she’s been quite cold and rude to them and seems to be quite jealous about me having a wide friendship circle and therefore won’t make any effort to get to know them (she also has a lot of friends who I’ve always tried to get to know) and to put the cherry on top she bumped into my Fiancé the other day with the mutual friend and the mutual friend chatted to my Fiancé and she just blanked him.

28,1ec5hj0,AITA for lashing out when my brother joked about my hygiene?,"

Hello everyone. never posted here. please tell me if I'm wrong.

I (20M) have been struggling with depression since I was a child, and I mean 10, 11 years old. 

I've never been too big on personal hygiene, because I've never had an ounce of energy to do so, as I've always spent the little energy I had on school work, didn't even have the energy to socialize.

And so, I've always had problems like dandruff, bad breath, stinky armpits, my uniforms being nasty and etc. Didn't help I had a neglectful mother.

The issue starts here: my brother (25M) never had an issue with pointing at this specific trait of mine and laughing, and I always DESPISED these jokes because I genuinely see myself as less than human at times, and this year I've been severely struggling with seeing myself as a worthless, dirty parasite that needs to go extinct, and part of this belief of mine comes from the fact that I basically lived (and still live sometimes) in filth. 

My room isn't always messy, as my friends have pointed out; they say I just owe a LOT of stuff, and that's true, I kinda don't have enough space for it all, but when it gets BAD, I start leaving dirty dishes and food all around, because I can't get myself to do something about it.

My brother and sister in law, whom are both very close to me and I love them so much, never EVER let me see the end of it. They're always pointing and laughing, saying I'm flithy and that I live in a garbage dump, and etc. and once they start, they simply won't stop.

I'm really, really trying to change myself. I've restarted treatment this year, trying to eat better, and trying my best to make my room clean so I don't feel miserable. But when they do that I can't help but feel like a dirty worm that lives surrounded by shit.

 I've never complained about these jokes, even once. but today, a day that it's going well and I'm doing fine and feeling okay, therefore don't have my self worth down at subhuman level, I've finally said something. except instead of saying ""please do not make these jokes, they make me feel bad"" I said something stupid like ""please just shut up, you don't understand how it is to have depression since I was a child"" and so, my speech seemed garbled and meaningless? I mean, I could've phrased it way better.

SIL said something like ""you know it was just a joke right? we joke about everything"" and brother started going like ""yeah but does your depression make you leave mayonnaise packets all around??"" and pointing everything single thing he could until I felt stupid and like a stupid asshole who can't handle the fact he's a dirty little rat who won't take accountability for being filthy.

I do not like it when my parents see that I am not feeling well because they can be pretty insensitive, especially my dad. But that day I was so sad that I could'nt help myself, so I cried in front of them. My dad (41m) said the usual hurtful things that he thinks will help me get better like ""oh you did not think you would stay forever with him did you ?"", ""it's because of the social media"", ""you need to toughen up""... 
My mom (42f) did not say much because she just doesn't really know how to comfort me. 

There was a moment that day when I was crying really hard and I just wanted to be alone in my room. Earlier, my mom had taken a card out of my wallet because she needed it to do some of my administrative work, as I am still young and don't really know how it works. This is the moment she chose to enter my room and spend minutes trying to make the card fit in my wallet. I just wanted to be alone to cry and i insisted for her to leave my room but she still struggled with the card. At that point I was losing my mind, I was feeling extremely bad and I just yelled at her to leave which made her say angrily before she left : ""why do I always have to adapt to others ? When will others adapt to me ?""
I feel like she could have waited for me to be calm to come in my room or that she could have left faster by just leaving the card on my desk, but maybe it was insentitive of me to yell at her as she was just doing what needed to be done in the house, plus it was specifically for me.

31,1ec50f8,AITA for creating another group chat for work related topics?,"
I’m part of a group of 5 health psychologists at a hospital, we have a group chat to talk about who sees each patient and other work related topics. Two members of the group Andy and Tamara are leaving next week permanently but will still be working for the hospital (Tamara is currently at another hospital site) and 3 new people have joined.  I used to be very close with Andy and Tamara until a month ago when they inexplicably cut me off, isolated me from my friend group and started excluding me from outings, ignoring me, being mean to me while laughing with others (even creating another FRIEND group chat without me) apparently because I stopped asking about them and being interested in their lives, when I was going through a very rough patch in my life. It’s been hard, I’ve been feeling pretty lonely since it’s the first time something like this happens to me.

Last week Andy didn’t come to work one day and I needed to communicate with my other two coworkers and the 3 new girls who weren’t part of the old group chat, so I started a new one. I also thought that since she was sick, I wouldn’t bother Andy with work related things so I obviously didn’t include her or Tamara in this case since it was about this hospital site. Today we had a team meeting and they passive aggressively told a “joke” about how we had excluded them and already wanted them to leave. They asked who created the group chat and everyone said me, so they just laughed it off and said “oh it makes sense she would do that”. This was in front of my boss, so of course I felt terrible, I don’t want to be seen as someone who is dividing the team or excluding others when clearly it wasn’t my intention. They’ve been talking crap about me to my other colleagues and even the 3 new girls so I feel frustrated because they kind of validated all the claims of me being “problematic”. After all it’s easy to believe that if one person gets cut off he or she is the problem. 

I really didn’t mean to exclude anyone, I just needed to get things sorted for work that day. So, AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-25,"AITA for creating another group chat for work related topics?

34,1ec4osw,AITA for not doing more around the house because of a severe back spasm?,"I (27f) have been dealing with a severe back spasm. It started a month ago and over the past week it’s gotten severe to where I can barely get out of bed. I’ve been crying in pain and the spasm will make it hard to breathe at times from how much pain it is to expand my lungs. I went to the dr 3 days ago and he gave me strong meds to help, told me it may take as long as it took to get to this level of pain for it to get back to the norm. He told me to rest my back. My fiancé (29m) has been pushing for me to take care of my health. 

Prior to going to the dr he has been upset that he has to do much more around the house. We have a puppy at almost 4 months old still being potty trained. When the pup has an accident I am unable to bend over and clean it up. I told my fiancé I will need him to help me with the things I can’t do at the moment. He said he figured and he would do it. 

At the start he was annoyed he couldn’t sleep in and we couldn’t rotate walking the pup in the morning like we used to. I told him I can’t do much right now but I would be doing all I physically could. He still wasn’t happy with that but “understood”. 

It happened again 5 days ago and we got into an argument. I cleaned the whole house in extreme pain feeling nauseous from it. I then had a talk with him about how he hasn’t been considerate of my back since it started hurting and kept expecting me to go on as normal when that wasn’t possible. He thought about it and apologized. He said he would do better and for the next 2 days it seemed like he was. 

The morning after getting my meds I had woken up before him and noticed our puppy had an accident in the kennel. I was not able to take care of it myself so I gently woke my fiancé up and told him I needed him to wake up and get the puppy cleaned up because I couldn’t. He blew up at me for not getting it myself and how it’s unfair he can’t sleep in and rotate. He continued to be mad and lecture me for the next 2 hours before calming down and apologizing. 

I feel like I’m TA for not doing more. He told me he thinks I’m “milking it”. He blurted out that his back hurts too but he still gets stuff done. He said “you don’t see me complaining”. I wish he was more considerate and picked up the slack for me instead of playing video games and getting mad when things pile up that I usually help with. But I also feel like a bad partner for it mostly being on him. Him 80 and me 20 %.

He blew up at me today for not jumping out of bed when he needed help with the pup. Told me to just go back to sleep then got mad that I tried to and said there’s stuff to do.

35,1ec4o4i,AITA For telling my SIL to go f herself at her baby's sip and see,"My wife's sister, Jen (33F) and her husband, Matt (35M) welcomed their first child about 4 months ago.  Jen didn't want a baby shower but decided on doing a ""sip & see"" for close relatives to meet the baby.  This happened last Saturday.  My wife has met the baby before this, but it was my first time seeing them since the birth.  

About 2 months ago, my dad passed away unexpectedly in his sleep.  It's been a really difficult time for me.  But I'm in therapy and on anti-depressants, both of which are helping.  I wasn't really looking forward to attending the sip & see, but it meant a lot to my wife that I come with her and she kind of pressured me to come since I hadn't seen the baby yet.  

The event was just close family, about 15 of us total, and very informal.  About an hour into the event, Jen asked me if I wanted to hold the baby.  I told her I didn't really want to, but she pretty much shoved the baby into my arms.  She then sat next to me and told me that she was sorry about my dad and that they regretted not being able to attend the funeral because of the baby.  I thanked her and told her not to worry about the funeral, I understand.  

She then went on this weird tangent about a new life springing from death and renewal of energy.  I had no idea what she was talking about and just kind of nodded along.  Then she said that she hopes seeing and holding a beautiful baby will help me get over my loss.  It was a weird comment and I looked at her and told her ""No, this is not helping me get over the death of my dad.""

She got defensive and told me that it was supposed to be a joyous day to celebrate a new life and that I should be happy and not dwell on my dad's death.  I didn't want to cause a scene in front of everyone, but I was pissed.  I handed Jen her baby back and leaned in close to her and whispered, ""Go f\*\^% yourself, Jen.""  

I then got up and walked over to my wife and told her that I needed to leave.  I told her she can stay if she wants, but I need to get out of there ASAP.  She asked me why and I told her I would talk to her about it on the drive home or later if she wants to stick around. 

By that time, Jen had gotten up and was on a warpath.  She came up to me, still holding the baby, and poked her finger at me telling me I have no right to talk to her like that.  That got everyone's attention and now everyone was looking at us.  Matt came over to ask what was going on, my wife was confused, Jen was basically yelling, the baby was starting to cry.  It was a mess.  

I told my wife I need to leave and she needs to make a decision right then.  She ended up coming home with me.  I explained what happened on the drive home and she said she understood why I was upset by Jen's comments and agreed she was out of line, but I shouldn't have said that to her.

36,1ec4b4x,AITA for not paying for a trip I won't be going on?,"A few months ago, my (27M) GF's close friends had planned a weekend road trip to a nearby city. The Airbnb (non-refundable) was booked \~3 months prior, for 9 people in total. I didn't know her friends very well, but I agreed to go because she wanted me to accompany her, despite me having already visited the city.

Since then, a lot has happened (unrelated to this trip) that made me realize my relationship was toxic, leading to me breaking up with my GF. She asked me not to communicate with any of her friends thereafter, and we went completely no contact. I've had no communication with her or her friends since the breakup, which happened over a month prior to when the trip was scheduled for. Her friends were aware of our breakup from the moment it happened.

However, to my surprise, I received this message from her friend a few days ago:  
**""*****Hey. Since the trip cancellation was last minute and a number of us are not earning, the cost of the trip will impact us negatively. We’ll have to charge you for your portion of the airbnb so as to alleviate pressure for our group, especially the several of us with financial pressure and large investments this year. I hope you understand.*****""**

1. Is a month's notice really considered ""last minute"" enough to warrant expecting me to pay my share?
2. As far as I know, only 2 out of the 8 people aren't earning since they're in grad school. They, however, have held high-paying jobs for 4-5 years before that. The rest of the group earns well too. Since I'm not going, the cost will be divided among 8 people instead of 9, adding about $20 more per person. With a total budget of $350-400 per person for the weekend, is a $20 increase significant enough to make a fuss over? Are they guilt tripping me? It's not like their selections of Airbnbs, budgets, or plans would've changed had I never intended to go.

I didn't respond to the message, and blocked her and her friends on all platforms. AITA for not paying $200 for a trip I can't go on?

**TL;DR:** Booked a non-refundable Airbnb for a 9-person weekend road trip with my GF's friends. Broke up shortly after and have had no contact with her or her friends since. Her friends are now claiming that I owe them $200 for the Airbnb as my absence is costing them an extra $20 per person. They’ve known for over a month that I wouldn’t be able to make it due to the breakup; it wasn't a last-minute cancellation. AITA for not paying?

**UPDATE**: I unblocked her and sent her the following message -

Hey. I understand that the group is facing financial pressures, and I empathize with the situation. However, it is not my responsibility to pay for a trip that I am effectively uninvited from as a consequence of the breakup. This was not a cancellation on my part, nor was it last-minute.

37,1ec48ei,AITA for telling my mom no when she asked me for money…. Again. ,"This is a doozy. Sorry for any grammar mistakes, please try to understand 🫶🏻

I (f17) have an interesting relationship with my mom (f54). My dad (m59) divorced my mom when I was 9 and the court placed me with my mother. My mother was incredibly unavailable when I was a kid. She is also an extreme hoarder and impulse buyer. When I turned 16, I moved in with dad. 

When my mother first found out that I was planning to move in with my dad, the typical questions came up. “Why?” “What did I do?” Etc. 

It’s important to note that my mother lost her job in January of 2023 and chose to wait a full year to start working again. She was living off of unemployment and money she had saved up. She went through over $20k in savings and college funds within 3-4 months - those two and my father paying her child support. 

About a week after we told her I was going to be living with my father, she started saying things like “because you’re moving in with your dad, I can’t afford to live in my house. So, I have to sell my house and move somewhere else.” I tried to dismiss as much of it as I could because it was close to time for finals in school and I didn’t want the stress. 

In March/April, my mother started to ask me for aid with paying her bills. I felt bad because of the comments about her having to sell the house because of me, so I paid bills for her. I (her att 16 year old daughter) paid over $1,500 in bills for her over the course of those 2 months. She promised me she would pay me back once she was in a more stable position. She has also used my card to pay for over $300 of stuff without my knowledge or permission. 

On my 17th birthday, my mother kicked me out. (I was still living with her since the moving in with my dad situation hadn’t been signed off yet). We had been cleaning and I threw out some Tupperware that we never used. My mother took my phone, debit cards, and kicked me out with only my keys and license. It was 6:30pm when this happened. 

After, my mother agreed to keep me at my father’s house for the next 2 months (May + June). During this time, I made no attempt to contact her as I didn’t want to deal with her. She also never gave me any of the money I had given to her. 

At the very end of June, she paid me back *some* of the money. She still owes me over $600. As of today (July 25th) my mother has asked me for another $100. She has made it clear to me in the past that I “can say no” when she asks for money. I told her I would not be giving her any more money because I am not currently working and need to save up for my college classes. Her response to that was “I’ll pay you back, I have no gas.” To which I did not respond. We got into a car accident a few weeks ago and she says she’ll pay me back all of what she owes me with the settlement money. 

 So, AITA for refusing to give my mom more money, even if it’s “for gas” and she’ll “pay me back”?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-25,"AITA for telling my mom no when she asked me for money…. Again.  This is a doozy. Sorry for any grammar mistakes, please try to understand 🫶🏻

I (f17) have an interesting relationship with my mom (f54). My dad (m59) divorced my mom when I was 9 and the court placed me with my mother. My mother was incredibly unavailable when I was a kid. She is also an extreme hoarder and impulse buyer. When I turned 16, I moved in with dad. 

When my mother first found out that I was planning to move in with my dad, the typical questions came up. “Why?” “What did I do?” Etc. 

It’s important to note that my mother lost her job in January of 2023 and chose to wait a full year to start working again. She was living off of unemployment and money she had saved up. She went through over $20k in savings and college funds within 3-4 months - those two and my father paying her child support.

38,1ec39cw,AITA for embarrassing my uncle at the family gathering?,"Background: I (26M) have an uncle Jake (28M). Growing up, we weren’t any particularly close since my parents have some issues with my grandparents. Not trying to brag on an anonymous account online, but I have way more luck with women than Jake. Yes that’s important to the story. Jake is the type to watch some of those ‘alpha male’ youtubers and read similar bullshit online, which obviously influences the way he approaches women, and it obviously causes exactly the opposite effect. Meanwhile I’m just being polite and respectful, and to be completely honest, I’m not really obsessed with the whole dating thing, at least not to the degree Jake is.

Another important bit of information: in high school I got in a particularly nasty MVA and became permanently disabled. It isn’t a turn-on by any means, but apparently I have enough selling points, like not being a total jerk and having some sense of humor.

A few days ago we had a family gathering and my grandparents started asking questions about the younger generation’s plans for marriage as usual. I jokingly told them that I have a hard time choosing between a few candidates (which is only partially true, but I’m not delving into my love life in this post, the point is, Jake knows about this too). It elicited a heated response from Jake, something along the lines of ‘why does he get all the chicks’. I replied with ‘oh I don’t know, they must be after my disability check’. This seemed to anger him even more and he became progressively more pissed, saying that it’s unfair that I have it easier with women. I jokingly told him ‘well you know, damaged goods come with a discount’, referring to me being slightly less picky about dating partners. It made him blow up completely and he said a bunch of really mean words addressed at me personally and at women in general. He practically screamed at me, calling me a ‘crippled loser’ and a worthless waste of space’. I was just listening to his rant, not saying a single word, which apparently only riled him up more. Honestly I did it on purpose since I know how much he hates being ignored, but also because I couldn’t come up with a witty comeback in time like I usually do when a verbal fight ensues. Eventually he stormed off, not without saying ‘I wish you died that day’. His parents/my grandparents followed him and the family gathering was more or less ruined.

Afterwards grandma sent me a text saying that I shouldn’t have bragged about my love life, knowing that Jake has issues with dating. I replied that I just answered her question and if she knew about his issues, why’d she ask us in the first place about something that is sensitive. She said that I should still be more considerate since he’s ’practically like a brother to me’. Now I’m curious about whether I should’ve handled it in a more mature way and not be unnecessarily witty.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-25,"AITA for embarrassing my uncle at the family gathering?

I’ve spoken about this to her and many other friends that for right now I want to be by myself and to please not come to me with their issues as I am not in the right mindset. 

For the last couple of months, my friend has been in a very negative mood. I have tried my best to help her by being patient, listening to what she has to say, giving her advice etc. Up until recently that I have crashed. She hasn’t really stopped. I understand family and personal issues don’t go away but, I assumed she would understand that I wasn’t okay. Despite my friends always trying to keep conversations positive with her in the chat, she would always dismiss any achievement anyone made and only replied with, “Oh” or “ok”.

Early in the morning, I woke up with 26 messages thinking something had happened. I check, it was my friend sending me huge rants about her family issues and her own as well.

She then proceeds to call me names and that she forgets how “perfect” I am because I can bottle up emotions and that I have an illness that I can use as an excuse to be a jerk. That I don’t understand the pain she is going through and I need to be a better friend. The world doesn’t revolve around me and there will be people who will do much worse.

40,1ec2rup,AITA For Not Showing Up to a Group Dinner?,"So this definitely was big miscommunication, but I want to know if I am at fault here. So I (23M) meet up with my friend group every Wednesday to walk around the lake to get some exercise and get dinner afterward sometimes. One of the other guys David (28M) invites half that group to his apartment afterwards for movie and board game nights. I am not part of the half that is invited, because I don't know him as well and am one of the newer people to the group. Also his apartment isn't that big. 

So yesterday all of us get to the lake, and one of the other guys John (25M) says that he's planning on going to a taco place for dinner after all of us finish. He said the movie group had gone before. John, by name, asks everyone in the not movie group (both by name) if they are want to come, but he doesn't mention me at all. So I just assume I'm not invited and that everyone else is and drive home. Well once I get home, John texts me asking where I am and that everyone was waiting for me at the taco place. I reply confused saying I wasn't invited, so I just didn't go. He said it was an open invitation and that everyone else went; I pointed out he mentioned everyone except for me to go, and he said ""get hearing aids."" I just didn't respond cuz I had packing to do cuz I move at the end of the month. 

But now I fear I've created drama in a situation that could have been avoided. I thought it would have better to assume I'm not invited if I was than assume I was invited if I was not.

At first I used to feel a little embarrassed about me needing to use it for so long and there have been times when he’s needed to use it while I was in there but overtime I’ve become less embarrassed about it. That also might have something to do with that he doesn’t do anything on time. And I mean any chore. Used dishes in the sink for weeks, trash not taken out for weeks during his turn, bathroom not cleaned as well. He does these things only when he’s about to have friends over but when not for us. His roommates should have to live in a mess. We had an argument about these things and I said everything that I mentioned and he said that I leave the bathroom dirty by leaving hair everywhere.

3 years ago Hubby had an issue with his work, made a complaint, went through mediation and was subsequently let go. I 100% supported him in this process, it was quite traumatic for my partner and myself, as he had a major falling out with his boss whom he had worked for many years and who he considered a friend, so took a big hit emotionally as well as financially. 
He took a few months have a break and process everything and got a stop gap job at local hardware, taking a 100k+ pay cut from his previous role. 3 years on he is still there earning well below his earning potential in his profession. 
With cost of living pressures, financial commitments (entered into on our previous income level) and retirement planning I prompt him (every now and then) to look for a higher paid role but he just deflects and never takes action.

50,1ec23wd,AITA for not letting my parents see their only grandson because my toxic mother won’t take accountability?,"I (27F) haven’t seen my parents for over a year, don’t worry I will go into detail. But before I do let me give a little context on our past.
When I was 9 years old, my mother went to prison for fraud. She had multiple counts and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. 

When my mother got out of prison she continued her old ways, she used my name to get a $40k loan and gave me $5k and said she would keep the rest for all the times she bought me things. Even after that she continued to make a tally for every single time she bought me something or bought something for our son.
So when we did have issues in the past she ALWAYS said it was because I was money hungry when in reality she stole money from me.

So now that you’re all caught up, back to the story. 
I had my first son and my parent’s FIRST grandchild a little over 2 years ago. My mother was ecstatic after begging me and my older brothers to “give her a grand baby” for YEARS. So after giving up on my brothers having kids you can imagine she was pretty excited. She was a great grandma BEFORE he was born. She would talk/sing to my stomach, and brag about being grandma to everyone. I truly loved it.

When my son was born my mom and dad fell in LOVE. my mom and dad came over as soon as we got home from the hospital. But my mother never respected our request. I.e My son was a preemie and we requested they wash their hands before holding him or letting him suck on there fingers etc. my mother didn’t and would say she’s had kids and it’s fine. Things like that.
As my son continue to get older, my father was very involved and engaging with my son. My mother one the other-hand, slowly started becoming less engaged with my son and more engaged with her online friends that she had never met and the popularity she was growing on Twitter (32k followers).
Honestly I could go into the many occasions she neglected to pay attention to her grandson besides for a photo to post to her followers or when I had to beg her to put her phone down, BUT this post would be longer then it already is. 

I did my absolute best to help build the relationship with my son and his grandparents by offering days where they can take him or we could all go out, but my parents proceeded to say “we are not a daycare service” and that’s honestly what started all of the drama. I was tired of begging my mom to try. 
In fact my mother went and posted on Facebook that I cut her off because of money and that I was mentally ill. Her post got a lot of attention and a lot of support for her “terrible experience “ and on top of that I got a text that my mom was getting a lawyer for grandparent rights. I was livid, and explained that we need some space after the lies and rejection she gave. 

Despite all our efforts she has continued to text me to belittle me even to this day

But if she doesn’t actually miss her grandson, am I keeping that from her and being to harsh?

A few more things my mother has done: 

-she forced me to file for bankruptcy for the loan causing issues for me to get a home, car, credit cards etc
-left me at the hospital alone because she was too tired
-counting every cent she ever used on me as leverage 
-tried to turn my in laws against me (they know she’s crazy)

51,1ec23o4,AITA for not inviting my child free friend to my twins’ birthday party?,"My 34F twins turned 5 this month. They both started school last September and I put them in separate classes as I wanted them to be more independent. When it came to inviting kids for their birthday, I invited both clasess, as at my kids school if anyone has a birthday they will invite the whole class, with some of the parents being kind enough to invite both twins despite one not being in the class. The guest list was just under 50 kids because of this. 

The twins are now at an age where they will remember their birthday, so I wanted the guest list to reflect who they would want although previously I have invited my friends and their kids to the twins’ birthdays, including child free friends as honorary aunties and uncles. 

Planning their 5th party was a bigger effort than I thought and although I originally planned to do it myself at home, I rented a soft play centre my kids love. I also invited a few family friends who had kids around my twins’ age, but not the child free friends as it was a soft play centre and I didn’t think it would be fun for them and I was being charged per person turning up so wanted to cut costs as they wouldn’t be using the soft play area.

I got a call from my child free friend Lily who mentioned that a mutual friend told her about the twins’ birthday and she was upset she wasn’t invited as their auntie. I explained to her it was a soft play centre and that was a kid activity. The twins’ have their own friends that they wanted and I didn’t want them to feel like it was my party.

Most of my other child free friends weren’t really that bothered about not being invited, but Lily and a few others said they wanted to be involved. 

My husband thinks we should throw a family party fans invite the child free friends to compromise- but to me it seems like a apology when I don’t really think we’ve done anything wrong by not including Lily and other child free friends. 

I will apologise if I am in the wrong but I don’t really know how to navigate this as me and my husband are one of the first in our friend groups to have kids, and I guess it was slightly unexpected for them not to be invited as they have been included on every other birthday of the twins and their big milestones.

52,1ec1loq,AITA for wanting my best friend to pay me back more than she owes me?,"I 15F and my bestfriend 15F are both in highschool, and obvioudly minor however I think Im feelinf one sided resentment towards her and am lashing out in petty stunts. Like paying back exactly the amount Im going to use rather than just half overall.

Essentially, me and her went to get our nails done and once we got there the place said they only accept cash, my bestfriend (lets call her Lisa) forgot her card, and as some may know, getting your nails done usually costs a little under £50 (mine costing £50, and hers £45 this time) . And because I didnt want her left out I took out money for both of us (£100) and at my age thats a lot of money. I told her as long as she pays my back the next day its fine. She was saying things like ""oh my god, thank you so much. Tomorrow I'll give you back £50, mostly because I cant be asked to take out £45 when on the ATM £50 is an option.""

I took that as she was just so grateful that I went above and beyond for her so she'll pay me back extra, which made me really pleased.And at that point everything was fine.

Next day rolls around, and we're at a different shopping centre with our friends. Me and Lisa run off to a nearby ATM, however, this time £40 is an option. So what she does is completely take back her word, or at least the promise I interpreted. So she takes out £40 and dumps a load of coins in my hand to make up the fiver. Excuse me?

And a bit o backstory, Lisa gets £90 per month, but because, in my opinion, shes not financially very smart, she likes to blow it all; literally its been what, 2 days since this and she onlt has £6 left. Whereas I, get £10 per week and extra money for chores my parents set for me. And I like to save it to be able to afford situations like these. Therefore, having way more money in comparison.

I 15F and my bestfriend 15F are both in highschool, and obvioudly minor however I think Im feelinf one sided resentment towards her and am lashing out in petty stunts. Like paying back exactly the amount Im going to use rather than just half overall.

Essentially, me and her went to get our nails done and once we got there the place said they only accept cash, my bestfriend (lets call her Lisa) forgot her card, and as some may know, getting your nails done usually costs a little under £50 (mine costing £50, and hers £45 this time) . And because I didnt want her left out I took out money for both of us (£100) and at my age thats a lot of money. I told her as long as she pays my back the next day its fine. She was saying things like ""oh my god, thank you so much. Tomorrow I'll give you back £50, mostly because I cant be asked to take out £45 when on the ATM £50 is an option.""

53,1ec1ka9,AITA for refusing to discuss my nephew with my parents?,"My husband (30m) and I (28f) have custody of my 7 year old nephew going on 5 months now. CPS removed him from the custody of my sister and BIL (both 33). My husband and I stepped up to take nephew. We have a case worker who works closely with us and with sister and BIL. Being honest, for the sake of the post, I suspect my husband and I will be raising our nephew for the rest of his childhood.

To give some but not all context. My sister has two kids with BIL. Nephew and my 4 year old niece. She was born with cancer and while they removed it quickly then, it returned a year ago and caused a very bad shift in dynamic between them and my nephew. They were quick to anger with him, ignored him in favor of my niece and the only time they really appeared to interact with him was when they forced him to visit his sister in the hospital. During one of those visits he wanted some attention, they scolded him, he started to cry, they got mad at him for upsetting his sister, started yelling until a nurse came into intervene. Then the hospital social worker was called in and by the end my nephew said he just wanted her to die so he could have them back and my sister and BIL lost their shit even more. They could not be calmed. They called my nephew all kinds of names and wished he'd die instead for sucking up attention from his sister.

When CPS were looking to place him with family, my parents also wanted to, but they were denied because it was believed they would not listen to the case worker and would take him to see his sister and that's a no no because he cannot have contact with his parents outside court ordered supervisors and his case worker. So we took custody.

My sister and BIL have made zero efforts to focus on their son since losing custody and have expressed no remorse or regret for what happened. They also turned down help offered by CPS, including therapy and supports to allow them to spend more time with nephew and not just niece.

My parents hate that my husband and I got custody over them. They hate that we're not defying CPS orders and bringing him around his parents and sister. They hate that we tell them nothing about how he's doing or what he talks about. They have asked me repeatedly if he regrets what he said and if he misses his parents and sister and wants to go back. They have also asked what his therapist (court appointed) has said. They wanted to attend therapy sessions and the case worker said not to, which we had already done, but she wanted me to know it was an official thing too and could back myself up if needed with it. There is technically nothing stopping me from talking about him since they're blood relatives. But given everything I feel it's best not to.

My parents told me recently he's their grandson and just because I have custody, it doesn't mean I can work against the rest of the family. That I should not be keeping things about their grandson from them. They told me they know I can talk about it.

Y and I were talking about who talks the most about other people and I mentioned person A. I said it as non-offensively as I could. I said that person A tends to let their mental instability and extreme anxiety get the best of them, which leads to the story (that they are spreading) getting twisted and distorted as it spreads. I clarified to Y that it isn’t A’s fault, given that everybody talks and it is like a telephone game. I have mentioned this to A in passing as well, that they tend to switch up the story unintentionally. At that time, they simply brushed off my comment. 

The next day, I get news from person X that Y told A what I said, that A is the biggest mouth, except Y conveniently left out what I said about it not being A’s fault and all that.

58,1ec1bdy,AITA for telling my daughter (28F) that she isn't trying hard enough to cure her sickness,"I am 50F, ages are fudged so my kids don't find the posts. 

My daughter (28F) has been diagnosed by 3 different doctors with depression. In December she saw a psychiatrist that said she has something called ""Double Depression"" and he is recommending outpatient treatment. Long story short, that didn't materialize and now she's looking at next steps.

The conflict starts here: a few days ago she told me that she got a call from the new psychiatrist and she has an appointment next month. She said that her family doc also is concerned she has a heart condition from the chronic stress of CPTSD because her resting heartrate is 120BPM (she's otherwise healthy), and it affects her ability to move/stand/sit upright for long periods of time especially on bad days. I asked her if she thought they were finally going to figure out what was actually wrong with her this time or if she's just expecting the doctor to give her a magical answer. I asked her ""At the end of the day, how many conditions do you actually have again? It seems like the list keeps getting longer and longer"".

I told her that she reminds me of my siblings who keep saying they have certain disorders or conditions and there's always a new one, and they just never work on actually getting better. I feel like she's even given up on giving up and now she's essentially ""quiet quitting"" her life and wasting away. I told her the only people that ever actually beat depression are people who try because they want to live, and it upsets me that she isn't happy or trying about the gift of life.

She got upset and told me first of all that she doesn't have a ""team of doctors"", she has a family physician with minimal mental health expertise and an online therapist she sees once a week for an hour, that expecting her with no support to undo a lifetime of illness in less than a year is unfair. She said she is trying, but that it's not good enough for me. She said that because of my anti-medication stance and pro-spirituality stance, all I do is assume she's popping pills because she wants to be numb in bed all day, but in actuality she spends her days working online, writing, talking to people online, she walks around the house, and does chores here and there when she can, when before she didn't leave the bed for days time. She said ""I can't make any progress in the eyes of someone who thinks I'm lying about everything."" Since she was a kid she's had a tendency to read about things online then act them out. The other day she went ""something's wrong with my head"", couldn't explain what, and fell. The next day she said she realized she forgot to take her medication and got something called ""brain zaps"". She has a word for everything. It's never just that she tripped. Then she stopped responding to me.

I'm worried that she's going to stop giving me updates about her health. I just don't want my daughter to be sick, she is such a brilliant girl and she is wasting her life with this stuff.

She said that because of my anti-medication stance and pro-spirituality stance, all I do is assume she's popping pills because she wants to be numb in bed all day, but in actuality she spends her days working online, writing, talking to people online, she walks around the house, and does chores here and there when she can, when before she didn't leave the bed for days time. She said ""I can't make any progress in the eyes of someone who thinks I'm lying about everything."" Since she was a kid she's had a tendency to read about things online then act them out. The other day she went ""something's wrong with my head"", couldn't explain what, and fell. The next day she said she realized she forgot to take her medication and got something called ""brain zaps"". She has a word for everything. It's never just that she tripped. Then she stopped responding to me.

I'm worried that she's going to stop giving me updates about her health. I just don't want my daughter to be sick, she is such a brilliant girl and she is wasting her life with this stuff. AITA?",1.0,1.0606154203414917,1,1

60,1ec17re,AITA for not going to church?,"Hello, I have a dilemma, I always hear these stories and now I felt the need to find another opinion on this.  

I am 18F and I recently told my parents that I no longer believe in God. I stopped doing so at 13 when I realized I didn't believe in God, I just acted like I did because my parents had made me believe that. Now I feel like they are heartbroken and trying to look for something in me that I never was. 

My parents say that they are not forcing me to be the perfect Christian or anything like that, but they want me to still go to church even if I don't believe, to do it for them, I don't like to go because my mind ends up wandering into horrible thoughts ( I have depression).  I cried the entire time there. 

Whenever they talk about what God did in their lives I am happy for them, but I don't feel any connection to their stories. I am grateful to them for the life they gave me and they feel that I am ungrateful to God. I think they try to accept it , and understand me but I don't think they do it in the best way. I don't know how to talk to them. 

They told me that they want me to go to Christian camps with young Christians "" like me"", to go to Christian youth meetings, to go to spiritual retreats and that when I do all that they will let me believe in whatever I want and that they will not pressure to believe anymore after that.

But I don't want to do it. I did those things (except retreats) my entire childhood and they never made me feel comfortable or understood. They make me feel stupid and ungrateful for the life I have to go to places like that. But I'm fed up and if I have to do all that I think I will do it... but I'm not sure. 

I don't know if I'm acting wrong by refusing these things, they are my parents, I love them and they love me... but am I wrong not going to church?

61,1ec13zn,AITA for not planning what the groom wanted for his bachelor party?,"Last weekend one of my best friends (26M) had his bachelor party. I am the best man and the wedding party is 8 of us. Most of us have been friends for awhile. We all live in the same city. I love the groom but he can be a bit of a diva sometimes. 

Groom told me how awesome he thought it would be to have his bachelor party in Barcelona. As the best man, I looked into it. But after discussing it with the group, 4 of the groomsmen told me verbatim that they won’t go because they can’t afford that kind of trip so if the plan is Barcelona they would be out. 

This put me at a tough decision because the groom told me what he wanted to do. So it’s either we roll with Barcelona with only half the group, or we do something else where everyone can attend. I decided on the latter and it would be more important to have everyone together. So I planned a weekend in the city that we live in. On Friday we went to dinner, a casino and then a strip club. On Saturday I booked a trolley party bus to take us to our cities MLB team’s game. It drove us around a bit before, took us to the game, drove a little bit after before letting us out by some bars. Everyone had a great time, even the groom. 

It wasn’t until afterwards that I heard through another friend that the groom said he had fun all weekend but was “slightly underwhelmed” in that it didn’t “really feel like a bachelor party” because we stayed in the same city and did things he “can do whenever he wants”. I am a little hurt he talked about it behind my back to someone. So am I an asshole for not doing what he explicitly said?

I text and asked her to be straight up with me, made it clear that it was not about the money but the principle of it all. She denied denied denied, giving a story about her card declining and her not realizing it. I sat with it for a bit, but knew I couldnt swallow the BS. I have been asking since (about 2 weeks now) for her to just be honest. She told me today that she will not be apologizing or taking any sort of responsibility bc it was “simply a mistake”. I feel like she is lying and am not sure how we can move forward if she wont take any sort of accountability. AITA for wanting to block her? How do I trust someone who cannot and will not be honest, or at the very least even apologize when they do fuck up and use my literal earnings without talking to me first. Its like she is ready to throw it all away to spare her ego… while all i am trying to do is protect myself from being treated like a doormat. 

context: she has been a serial klepto since HS, recently went and stole her moms cc and blew hundreds while on vacation (after/while moving back in w her mom and staying on her couch). I had also been covering *some* of her expenses when able, as she has not been able to keep a job since moving home (including smoke, gas for her car, food, wine, etc.) and I have been HAPPY to do it.

63,1ec11r0,AITA for telling my girlfriend to stop feeding and pampering her roommate?,"My girlfriend (F22) rents an apartment as a college student and since she has some bills to pay, she decided to get a roommate. According to my gf, this roommate (F28) isn’t a student anymore and is working and has a decent paying job. So naturally, I was relieved that she will have someone to split the bills with. But as time pass, things didn’t went exactly as I expected. 

For further context, her roommate has a job, but whenever they have to pay their bills, this roommate is always late, to the point that my girlfriend or I have to pay for it with our own money in the meanwhile. This made me wonder how in the world she can't designate money for their expenses if she has a job, and it turns out that she lives a luxury lifestyle, purchasing expensive items to the point of incurring numerous debts as a result. That is why she freeloads the majority of the time.

Moreover, my gf would complain to me that this roommate is very lazy, to the point that my gf is the only one cleaning their apartment every time. I would always tell her that she should be frank with her roommate about this issue but she would always dismiss me saying that she hates telling people to do their chores more than once, and that is why most likely she would do it herself. 

The worst part about this is when my girlfriend cooks her own food or our food when I am in her apartment hanging out, her roommate would also wait for us to finish cooking and she would lay in her bed guilt tripping us to give her a dinner. I would always tell her that it is okay to give her a food as long as she would give money as a contribution, but the thing is she doesn’t give anything to my gf. 

Every time that this happens, me and my gf would argue because I hate seeing her roommate freeloading off my gf like that. My gf would later say to me that she is just doing it because she can’t eat if the people around her aren’t eating too, she says that she would feel guilty. 

Recently, I just lashed out because I can’t take it anymore and my gf and I had an argument where I questioned her about why is she allowing a grown-ass woman to freeload off her allowance. Then, she said that she is just doing that because of the guilt thing and then I went home. Right now, I am feeling bad that I might have acted rashly.

Fiancée and them are close, and I'm close with them too. My sister and I are not close and I never wanted her in the wedding. To be honest I have some big doubts about inviting her (and our parents) too. But as of right now they are.

But of course the decision not to ask my sister or give her some role in the wedding, has been controversial.

For background. She's 25 now and I'm 28. She's the golden child and became the golden child when she got sick (cancer) at 4. From that point on our parents went from making me feel like neither of us was the favorite, to them showing very clearly she is. They turned her into a spoiled, entitled brat and honestly, I kinda hate her. She's very difficult to be around. She does not have any good relationships because of her entitled attitude. Our parents and a large percentage of our family treat her like she's still a sick 4 year old who can do no wrong and deserves to get everything she ever wants. She had the police called on her when she was 16 because she stole like $200 worth of fabric, that was used for a fashion design class our high school had, from the high school and they pressed charges, but mom and dad were able to work out a deal to stop her suffering any consequences. She was kicked out of a cousins wedding last year because she showed up in a white dress, with all kinds of glitter and sparkles on her, and she was posing like a model on the aisle and even stood at the alter to do some more poses. It resulted in a huge fracture in the family because a few who sided with the cousin getting married were called some pretty shitty things. It didn't shock me. My sister cannot stop being the center of attention.

Given all this you can image she wasn't happy to learn she wouldn't be a bridesmaid too AND to make the whole thing worse, when asked by her and my parents what she'd be doing, I told them she'd sit there like the rest of the invited guests. They said she's family, my only sibling, and should be in the wedding party. Either a bridesmaid or make her my best woman.

68,1ec0lsd,AITA for insisting my friend can't take an art class where my son is modeling?,"Update at the bottom.

My (43F) friend Joan (45-ish F) is ""that friend."" She is just very extra in every sense. She's outspoken. Loud. Always the center of attention. I have to admit me and my friends think she can be fun to be around to a degree, but is often a bit much.  My husband can't really stand her.

She is also something of a cougar (self described). She's divorced and is always chasing younger men (mostly unsuccessfully) and her talk tends to be on the bawdy side.

One of the art museums in our city offers classes, all kinds. One of the classes they frequently offer is a Figure Drawing class. Fine, I'm not an artist (I've tried! I can't draw a straight line) but I know that is important to those who are. A year or so ago my son Sam (19M) actually volunteered as a life model for those classes. The museum had put out a call for models and since they were looking for athletic types (there was some kind of Greek athletes theme to the class I think), he and his best friend who is also a teammate at school volunteered, they basically dared each other, I think. Sam actually enjoyed doing it, and they paid pretty well. Sam actually thought it was highway robbery to just hang around and be still with his clothes off for an hour twice a week and then get a check. Hey, more power to him, he has never been shy.

Well, even though I never mentioned the classes OR Sam's involvement, Joan has signed up for this class. What?? Joan always likes to insert herself in ""community things"" and thinks she is some kind of society maven, but as far as I know she has never had any artistic leanings whatsoever.

I think this is just an excuse for her inner cougar to come out and for her to have an excuse to be around naked young guys. Ewww. In fact I know that's the case.

When she mentioned she was taking the class, I said ""Oh. Wait, no, Sam is modeling in that class."" Joan gave a faux-shocked face and said ""Ohhh IS he?"" and smiled with raised eyebrows. Ewww again.

Joan has never said anything OVERTLY wildly inappropriate about Sam before, but she has made some comments about him (and his friends) that I'd consider more than borderline. I would rather that she not be involved with this at all, or that Sam would not model for the upcoming round of classes.

Would I be an asshole if I ""stepped in"" and put an end to this in one way or the other?  My husband agrees that it is all very cringy, but I also think I would be an asshole if I didn't just mind my own business and stay out of it.  I really want to insist she not take it though, or that Sam doesn't model this round. I definitely don't want to tell Sam that he can't do it, but it might come to that.

# --UPDATE--

Many thanks to everyone who commented, a lot to think about.

I will clear up some things here and give an update.

1. Yes I will admit I'm judgmental about Joan. She is not really my friend to a great degree, but is very ensconced in my friend group which is quite tight. Some others do find her equally unappealing, but others find her an ""absolute hoot"" and so she is tolerated by the group. Personally, I distance myself from her and will be doing more.
2. Her cougar status: She does date (when she can) young men in their early 20s and such. But she certainly seems to like (and look at) those even younger.
3. She has known Sam since he was about 12, I think.
4. Another incident or two that I think shows what kind of person she is: A couple of neighborhood boys went to her house to help her move some things, attic/garage. These are friends of Sam, he wasn't involved but they related the story. The boys were told more than once they could ""take off their shirts so they don't get all sweaty and dirty."" In fact she encouraged it multiple times, I don't think they did, though. The last time our group was together in a restaurant there was a commercial for the Olympics on the TV. Joan commented ""I love the Olympics. I've been watching that cutie Tom Daley in his teeny Speedo since he was a teenager."" Thanks Joan. But you get the picture.
5. She did know Sam modeled, and although she never asked ME ""So which class is he in?"" or anything like that, I have every belief that she ""researched"" it. She never had one bit of artistic inclinations before.

I took the advice of many and just talked to Sam to give him a heads up. It gave him a major case of the Icks. WITH gagging sounds, and usually nothing bothers this kid at all. Trust me he does NOT consider Joan a MILF. She has no kids so she's not an ""M""... and ""ILF"" doesn't apply at ALL. Sam is not interested. He beats the girls off with a stick and is as grossed out by the idea of her as I am.

Solution: Sam says there are two groups on each day there are classes, And he said that it will be easy to find out the student roster and he'll just day-of swap with his friend Dax who is the other model. They have swapped before and the instructors don't care as they are very similar types. Joan won't even know until he doesn't show up :)  She'll be surprised, but maybe not disappointed as Dax is a very good looking young man as well. If she has no ill intentions, fine, she'll still get to draw with a good model. If her intention WAS just to get a peek at Sam in the buff, OR just to get under my skin about it, she will have been thwarted.  Good enough for me.",Asshole,2024-07-25,"AITA for insisting my friend can't take an art class where my son is modeling? Update at the bottom.

My (43F) friend Joan (45-ish F) is ""that friend."" She is just very extra in every sense. She's outspoken. Loud. Always the center of attention. I have to admit me and my friends think she can be fun to be around to a degree, but is often a bit much.  My husband can't really stand her.

She is also something of a cougar (self described). She's divorced and is always chasing younger men (mostly unsuccessfully) and her talk tends to be on the bawdy side.

One of the art museums in our city offers classes, all kinds. One of the classes they frequently offer is a Figure Drawing class. Fine, I'm not an artist (I've tried! I can't draw a straight line) but I know that is important to those who are. A year or so ago my son Sam (19M) actually volunteered as a life model for those classes. The museum had put out a call for models and since they were looking for athletic types (there was some kind of Greek athletes theme to the class I think), he and his best friend who is also a teammate at school volunteered, they basically dared each other, I think. Sam actually enjoyed doing it, and they paid pretty well.

For short, i want to be an AH so my sister stops speaking to me for as long as possible. Asking her clearly doesnt seem to be enough so i may straight up start insulting her and making her angry whenever i see her, just so she'll leave me alone.

My sister 25F and I 20F really do not have a good relationship. My mom was sorta abusive during our childhood (a lot better now) but she took the most of it according to her. Because of that and the fact that i probably was an annoying kid when i was around 10, she resents me a lot.

Now, she knows very well how to push my buttons and has done so frequently since i can remember. It was ok at first but now we cant see each other for more than 20 minutes without a mocking remark or an attempt at humilation. She loves to talk to me as condescendingly as she can muster; frequently calls my friend group ""special magic unicorns"" cause two of them have dyed hair; makes sure to point out any imperfection i have as soon as she sees it, always calls my work/studies ""cute""/""adorable"" or ""chinese thing"" (I work in animated movies. We're French) etc...

If i dare point out that she is being annoying, and i always do so as calmly as i can, she starts saying i'm always mean without reason and i treat her like she's a tormentor when she just wanted to help/be nice/compliment me. Often, she'll start crying.
Ive already tried to tell her that i wanted to stop speaking to her but on the next day she was sending me instagram reels again (minion memes).

It's hard to avoid her as my parents invite her over quite often and i spend my week ends at their place. She also seems to want to talk to me all the time despite me giving her the cold shoulder (she invited me to her 25th birthday?? I wont go of course but i dont see why she would)
Anyways. Ive been trying not to upset her and to back down when she gets angry/sad but im debating if i should stop caring about her feelings and just push her away for good so she stops speaking to me.

I love her like she is my own and I am so proud of her and how far she has come.

I am very involved in my church and we were planning an event for moms/kids. It coincided with my monthly sack lunch ministry for seniors so in the morning we’d all make the lunches and then we’d do other things. Make friendship bracelets, run around, grill, tie dye, etc. 

My DIL is not religious but she does like to give back so when I invited her she accepted. We got the lunch supplies and she helped with the lunches. She even offered to go deliver them to the organization we work with since she has a big car. 

This is when the church organizer Cathy started an issue. She thanked my DIL and said that would be all we needed from her all day and she can go home after. I said no, DIL is here to spend the day with me and have fun with everyone.

Cathy had the gall to make an ugly face and said “She’s not anyone’s daughter.”

I said that’s ok, she’s my daughter in law if Cathy didn’t know.

Cathy made another ugly face and said that didn’t count and that she didn’t even “belong” here which ruffled my feathers. Everyone should be allowed. If one of the dads wanted to come join us I would have said yes. Who cares. 

We got into an argument and my DIL ended up crying. Again she JUST lost her mom. She left and told me to have fun and I rounded on Cathy and told her that what she’d just done was as unchristian as I’d ever seen. And that if she can’t find it in her heart to welcome EVERYONE to our events she should NOT be the volunteer organizer. 

Cathy told me tough cookies if I don’t like it to take it up with the church office. And a few other members overheard and as I got ready to load up my van for the sack lunches a few helped me and got to talking about how awful Cathy has been. After I left they all cornered Cathy and said they would ALL talk to the church office.

Well she isn’t the organizer anymore and she has been for over 2 decades. She ended up confronting me after Church raising her voice, getting in my face, etc. She told me I had ruined her life over my DIL not belonging to the church and that she hopes I was happy.

71,1ec0fqd,AITA for having too much to drink and falling on my face? ,"This happened about a year ago, and I still don't like to share this story because I have a lot of shame associated with it. My friends and therapist say I'm NTA, but they're biased because I'm just so goddamn delightful otherwise.  :)   

So here was the deal.  Last February 2023, I (then 42F) had just returned from a weeklong trip out of town to visit family with my two children (then 6M and 3M), and (for reasons not relevant here) it was a challenging, emotional trip.  My husband (then 44M) did not attend, as he does not attend visits with family.  A few days after I returned, I went out with a girlfriend for dinner & drinks, and the critical point is that I ate too little and drank too much.  My friend and I went outside and while I was waiting for the Uber, I tripped with my hands in my pockets and fell on the sidewalk, meeting it nose-first.  I got lucky in that my nose was the only thing to hit (no teeth or anything) but my nose bled - a LOT - and my friend kindly took me to the restroom and got both of us cleaned up from the copious amounts of my blood covering both of us.  I wasn't blacked out, so I remember all of it - I was mostly just humiliated by the whole episode.  

She and her husband left in their Uber and I left in mine.  On the way home, she texted my husband (which was a bit awkward, because he doesn't like her and she knows it) to say ""hey, your wife took a spill and hit her face on the sidewalk, I'm a little worried she might have a concussion - please keep an eye on her.""  When I arrived home, he greeted me by saying ""What the fuck happened,"" and I responded, ""What do you care?  You don't love me anyway.""  (Yes, there's a lot of background to the relationship issues, but I want to stay more or less focused.)  He packed a bag and his musical instrument, got in the car, and drove off to spend the night in the hotel.  Kids were asleep upstairs.  I got myself some Advil, drank some water, and went to sleep on the couch.  

The next day, I was fairly horrified by my behavior; our plan for the day had been that I'd bring the kids to see him play a gig the following afternoon and then we'd all go to Dave & Buster's.  So... at the appointed time, I packed the kids into the car and we went to go see him play the gig.  I wasn't quite sure what else to do.

When we addressed it during a big row a few months later, I said that it was messed up of him to just walk out when he knew I'd hit my head and was drunk, especially with the kids sleeping upstairs.  If I HAD been concussed, I could have died and the kids would have been in real trouble given that he never contacted us and just went to his 2 PM gig.  His response was to say that he didn't sign up for this, referring to my ""self-destructive behavior.""  

I was so embarrassed about going out and having too much to drink that I really didn't tell anybody about it for a good long time.  So: AITA?

74,1ec01fh,AITA for telling my friend he’ll never make it as a bodybuilder? ,"My friend and I are 21m. He's been going to the gym for 4 years, and wants to pursue a professional bodybuilding career. As an aspect of this, he wants to hop on steroids.

I think that would be a bad idea, because obviously steroids come with a risk of health issues, and I don't believe he would be able to succeed in bodybuilding, so the risk would be for nothing. 

The reason I don't think he'd succeed is:

1) really narrow shoulders and really wide waist. A big part of bodybuilding is getting the v taper wide shoulders narrow waist look. Just due to bone structure, no matter how muscular or lean he gets, he won't have that. 

2) a big gap between his two pecs and uneven abs, which like the narrow shoulders/wide waist goes against the aesthetic standards that competition judges are looking for 

3) he's really, really tall (6'8), which is a negative when it comes to bodybuilding, since the taller you are, the more area your muscle mass is spread out over, and the smaller you look.

So, I feel like he won't succeed in bodybuilding anyhow, and so taking steroids will raise the risk of health issues for no actual gain since he won't succeed anyhow. Since I'm not an expert, I asked a mutual friend of ours who has actually competed in and won bodybuilding competitions, and he essentially agreed with my thoughts. 

I asked this mutual friend to go with me and talk to my friend about why hopping on steroids would be a bad idea since it would be for nothing. He agreed, and we talked to my friend.

I think that would be a bad idea, because obviously steroids come with a risk of health issues, and I don't believe he would be able to succeed in bodybuilding, so the risk would be for nothing.

76,1ebzvbd,AITA for putting someone with anxiety on the spot?,"I was at a bachelorette party this weekend. There were 12 people there who all know the bride, but only 4 of whom I knew before the weekend.  
  
Some of the bride’s friends are super into the tacky stereotypical bachelorette stuff, which I find super cringe-worthy. There were adult party games and drinking games involved. I don’t love either one, but I’m willing to do mildly awkward or embarrassing things for a laugh as part of the game, if that’s what the bride wants. And she’d banned photos/phones during the games, so a much better atmosphere.  
  
One of the drinking games involved vaguely and occasionally more explicitly sexual stuff. “Georgia” was super extra into this game. She was super on top of everyone when they pulled a card, like hovering and insisting that p\*\*\*es be drawn bigger, asking super detailed questions about someone’s first time, etc. I found this uncomfortable and cringe-worthy.

After about ½ the game, the card that I drew that said something like “kiss the person to your right and give them a nice b\*\*b squeeze”. As I was trying to come up with an entertaining alternative (if I’m uncomfortable with doing something, I suggest a funny alternative instead), Georgia was catcalling, talking about using tongue, how long the kiss should last, etc. Basically, gross and unwanted. I jokingly called “you’re welcome to take my place”. But then I thought that \*would\* be an entertaining alternative. Get two girls who are super into it to do it. So I walked over and held out the card and told her now’s her chance. My friend, the person on my right (who will do pretty much anything with anyone), did a sexy walk over to Georgia saying  “I’ll even give you a few extra seconds” and making kissy sounds. Instead of engaging or laughing but refusing, Georgia starts breathing heavily and runs out crying. (Apparently, the idea of kissing a stranger gave her a panic attack, we learned later). The other friends I didn’t know start saying things like “omg, how could you. She has anxiety. Why did you have to push her like that?”  It very much killed the vibe, game was over, everyone dispersed and hung out in their rooms instead. There was still some tension the next morning.  
  
Honestly, I went that route because in my experience, saying “no, I simply refuse to do that” always makes the game awkward. Fun alternatives make people laugh. And Georgia was clearly into it.

  
Where the AITA might come in is that someone had previously mentioned that Georgia has anxiety. But she was so super into the game and egging everyone on. I’d expect her to be sitting back or quietly refusing to do some things if it made her anxious. Like, I find most of the typical bachelorette games so uncomfortable, but I’d never bully others into doing it if I wasn’t willing to do it myself.

We were doing some heavy drinking, when someone came up with a game they called secrets or something

The game goes like this, someone whispers a question to anyone they choose (example: who is the ugliest person here?), and the person answering chooses the person who best fits, the person whose name is picked doesnt get to know the question unless they take a shot, the person who answered can take a shot too to stop them from hearing the question, it keeps going until someone taps out. The person who was picked then has to ask a question to someone, thats how the game goes.

I thought it was a terrible idea at the start, because its not like we are all super close friends, and alot of the questions were targetted at specific people, or they were asking the most awful, mean questions.

Someone asked me ""who has the most fucked up teeth here"" and it was clearly geared towards this one girl there who was on the quieter side.

I said fuck that and told them Im not playing, and everyone kept telling me I had to take 5 shots because I refused to answer the question.

I said nah again, and the dumbass who asked me that question said it out loud and it made it so awkward because everyone knew it was basically just meant for that one person.

Somehow I am the bad guy for turning a small game into a big awkward situation by not just playing along.

79,1ebzn2k,"AITA For wanting my partner to take on more chores, despite him working more?","This is an issue I (23F) have been having with my bf (25M)

We used to live in an apartment, where we split the chores 40-60, because I work part time and he works full time. It worked wonderfully, I never felt too stressed, and still felt supported.

Then, he obtained some property with his family (So he owns a percentage) but the property is unfinished, so we've been living in a trailer for a year and a half now. At first, things were alright. He was working less, but still split things 40-60 though at this point I was out of work due to the move/lack of transport.

A few months in, he and his friends started work on our place, and I things were getting messy quicker. One day, after it had been a couple days since the dishes got washed, I asked what his plan was. It was then he informed me that the chores were my issue, as he was busy handling building. I didn't like that he decided they would be on me without any discussion, and I couldn't argue much as his friends were there. Plus, I had no issue taking the brunt of chores since he was working more and had a lot on his plate 

That lasted a week before his friends left, and since then due to permit issues we have gone stale on construction. No big deal, except chores never went back the way they were. This time, the excuse was that he's still working and I'm not working at all, and now the mortgage bills were all on him (Since I don't have ownership)

Fair enough, right? Few months go by and I get my license. Yay! I can finally start working, get a job right away. But chores don't change. This time, it's because I'm working less than him *and* he hated his job. I say OK, I can see how stressed he is, and although it's not ideal I put up with it.

Then he left that job because he hated it, and decided to take a break as he'd been working hard since 14- Which is true, man is one of the hardest workers I know... When he's at work. This 'break', due to an early inheritance, lasted about 5 months. In that time nothing changed. I was working part time, him not at all, but *this time* the reason was because he still had to pay all the bills. And then he got a job again a couple months ago and now it's back too ""I work more than you and pay the bills""

I'm not a gold digger. I'm not here trying to live rent free on his property. I pay my own phone bills, subscriptions, car insurance and gas. To help with costs I am the sole provider of food, although the food bank helps a lot. I do all the errands, as he despises running errands. All he is covering is rent and internet, as utilities are covered by his parents who also live on the property.

81,1ebzk10,WIBTA if I don’t lend money to a single mom in financial need?,"A couple of months ago I started chatting with an old (good) school friend of mine again. Back info to my friend: She had a planned child at 19 years old with her boyfriend. She willingly stopped her training at a supermarket for that, knowing she’d need to start full time again. She was committed to the point of letting her daughter have his last name. In reality he was cheating on her with numerous girls, tried to hit on me and when I was trying to tell my friend she refused to believe me and blocked me everywhere. Two years later she herself caught him red handed, unblocked me and apologized. We now text casually maybe 3–4 times a month but not more than that. I see her as an acquaintance at best. 

She is now a single mother with a 3 year old daughter, unable to finish her training at the supermarket because she doesn’t have the time. She gets unemployment money and child allowance from the state as well as alimony from her ex. 

She started asking for money two months ago. It started with small sums like 20 € (~ 22 $) up to 100 €? (~ 108 $) “. The state has currently cut her money since she forgot to deliver some form (which she didn’t but they try to sabotage her, in her own words).

I am currently living off my partners income since I am in between two university courses and am waiting for my state run scholarship (which covers my half of the rent) and have a side job lined up in October. Until then my partner is financially supporting me with 200 € (~ 217 $) for household relevant expenses like gas, groceries etc. whenever he’s not at home and I urgently need something. “Fun expenses“ are not necessary imo. I want to cover them myself starting with October again (I already have an overfilled closet and makeup drawer).

Usually I am really happy to help friends in need, but in her case I sense that she stacks up her debts and possibly won’t be able to pay them back (since she asked for 4 times now and the number gets bigger every time). I denied in the friendliest way possible when I was still living off my own savings from university (before my partner stepped in) and even sent her my bank app with my well protected 240 € (~ 260 $) left, since I didn’t want to make her feel like I am cheating her. She asked me for 100 € (~ 108 $) and replied I had enough for her and she’ll definitely will pay back everything at the start of the following month. I still denied since it was everything I had at that time and asked her to ask someone more financially stable.

I was pushed by the family for Jarret's sake to lift the order, even though I didn't feel safe. And then from that point since she moved in, Jan has had it out for me and I guess Jarret too.

83,1ebyzy6,WIBTA for confronting a group of girls harassing my friend.,"My friend went through a hard time a while ago and I think I have more disgust for the people than they do.

My friend was sadly cheated on (which was a shock to all of us) and she was obviously hurt by it. I love my friend so I was there for them through it all. At first I was very angry at their partner but as time has gone on  i've actually realised I don't hate the guy, he owned up to his wrong and has been trying to make it right ever since. They took some time apart and now are making things work. HOWEVER the girl he cheated on with (it was a few times they slept together and it lasted 3/4 months) and her friend have been an absolute nightmare. She knew they were in a relationship so she's not 'innocent' and although she doesn't have an loyalties' to my friend, it's still vile.

The girl who my friend's partner cheated with (lets call her Samantha) and her friend (lets call her Mandy) have been harassing my friend for over a year, they've even gotten other people from their pathetic group involved, messaging and cyber harassing my friend and a few of our other friends. My friend never had a problem with Samantha (Samantha was stalking her on socials for months prior and was the one who told us the news). She even told me she doesn't care for Samantha, she could've been anyone, it's her partner she was angry with. Samantha and Mandy will make fake accounts spreading lies about how we're threatening them and sending them 'abuse'. Neither my friend(s) or I have contacted, messaged or spoken to them once, not once!!! My friend has also encouraged us to ignore their DMs but i've had enough. They so desperately want to break up my friend and her boyfriend and get a reaction out of us and I just don't understand the obsession. My friend is very respected and anyone who knows her literally loves her, she's the sweetest thing and didn't deserve any of this. She's very successful in her career and from what's heard from my friend's partner Samantha has no career and is a single parent so I can understand if jealously is at play here. The lies from Samantha and Mandy attack my friend's character and that's something that doesn't sit well with me at all. It's been over a year and a half and yet they still are messaging a bunch of people, spreading lies, saying my friend is practically bullying and threatening Samantha.

84,1ebyv8v,AITA if I pee in the kitchen sink?,"English is not my first language, but I read posts like this, and my aunt, who is a teacher, told me to write here to get help with a problem.

I am M17. My parents died in a car accident a year ago, and my sister F28 got custody of me, so I moved in with her. We have different fathers, we barely know each other. I tried to communicate with her, but she usually ignored me. She works from home for several hours a day.

The apartment has an en suite bathroom, and my sister spends A LOT of time in the bathroom. I don't know what she can do there for so long. If I get up in the morning, she is already there, comes out after any hours, and if I go to bed, I don't wait for her to come out of the bathroom after her evening shower. I really don't know what she does there.

The problem is that I can't pee while she is in the bathroom. I tried to knock on her door, ask her to go outside for five minutes, or even tell her I wouldn’t look, but she wouldn’t let me. So I made the stupidest decision of my life: I started peeing in the kitchen sink.

I would put away all the dishes, try to pee right in the drain, and then wipe the sink with a sponge and detergent. I was so ashamed because I didn’t like the act of doing it. As for pooping, I usually either held it in or walked to the nearest mall.

Then my sister found out I was peeing in the sink. She was furious. So furious that our neighbors called the police because of her screams. I learned a lot of unpleasant things about myself. Part of me knows I’m being disgusting. But I told her that if she’d let me use the toilet, this wouldn’t have happened.

Eventually, my sister kicked me out of the apartment with my things. I had to ask a police officer for a cell phone and call my paternal grandmother. She lives in the suburbs, but it's better than nothing.

I currently live with my grandparents. My grandpa thinks I was a real man, and my grandma calls me a ""nasty bastard."" I know I was nasty, but I had good reasons for doing so. And I told my grandma so, but she still says so.

My aunt (my sister's, not mine) teaches English at the university I want to go to. She heard about my situation and is willing to help me with housing. And she suggested that I write to Reddit and let them judge.

Edited: I should probably clarify a few things. My sister lives in an apartment building, so I couldn't go outside every time I needed to pee. And she didn't have a set schedule for when she worked and when she showered or did other things. I tried peeing in bottles, but my hands were shaking after the accident, and that was a problem sometimes. And I did wash the dishes first, then pee, then clean the sink.

85,1ebybpk,AITA for wanting more help during the summer with our baby? ,"I take care of our baby almost all the time. I feed him, bathe him, change him, and get up with him multiple times during the night. Essentially, I do everything. My husband occasionally helps out with the baby, but it's rare. We also have an older child, and my husband tends to spend more time with him because he finds it easier to manage older kids. He will take him to the dr, play with him, etc. 

We both work full time, but have the summers off.  During the summer, I would love to sleep in some mornings. However, that's never possible because the baby wakes up early. Meanwhile, my husband often sleeps in until ten, and when he wakes up, he usually goes to work out or spends hours playing video games. He does have a stressful job as a coach during the school year and works a lot during the summer at camps and other activities. In contrast, I stay home with the kids, visit my parents, and generally have a more relaxed summer.

When we're both home and not working, I sometimes ask him to get up with the baby or skip his workout so I can take a nap or have a break. Sometimes when I ask he does it, and other times he gets mad. Says he'll just do everything and has a lot of aggression. He argues that ""he doesn't expect me to help with yard work or his other responsibilities, so why should I expect him to help with mine?""  I don't even like to ask him anymore because of his reactions and most of the time it lasts a short while because he can't handle the baby. 

Am I being unreasonable to want him to occasionally skip his workouts or help more with the baby? I'm exhausted and feeling increasingly frustrated with the situation.

88,1eby6i6,AITA For suggesting a baby name to my sister in law when she asked for one?,"i've never used reddit before so bare with me. I ,17f, have a brother (24). His wife, my SIL (23yrs old), is 5 months pregnant. Recently, both my brother and her came over to stay at my parents house for a few days. I haven't really met with her much due to them living a few states away and i was too busy with school to visit. But because it's summer break, i've been trying to form a relationship with her. 
She's a little shy and timid, but we get along super well as we share similar interests (baking, video games, movies, etc.) A few nights ago, my mom asked casually if my brother and SIL had settled on a name yet. They said no but said they wanted to find a name that has roots in our heritage. 
For context, my grandmother came over to the states from poland when she was a teenager. My mother grew up learning polish but not being taught how to properly speak it. She can say a few greetings and simple phrases like, ""How are you?"", ""What's for dinner?"", etc. But she always expressed how she wished she took the time to learn proper Polish. Well, recently i joined my mom to take a simple Polish class once a week. One of the firsts lessons was to identify common Polish names/ titles, so that we could get the accent down. 
Well, when my brother said he hoped to find a good Polish name, my mom perked up and said that if they needed help, she could always make a list. The next day, around noon, me and my mom where sitting on the couch watching TV when my SIL shuffled into the room. She sheepishly asked if we could help her with baby names. 
My mom and i where happy to help. After a few minutes of shuffling through a few names, i suggested Tomasz (Toe-Maz). My SIL's family all lives in Ireland and because Thomas is an irish name, having the polish version could be a nice blend of the cultures. SIL seemed to really like the name and thanked me and my mom.
Now here's where i don't really understand what happened. I guess shortly after, SIL texted my brother the name, he agreeed and said he liked it. Then after, SIL called the rest of her family and announced the name. I guess there was some sort of disagreement on the name or what version to use (??) and it ended in my SIL telling her family to ""suck it up and deal with it."" As far as i know, SIL's family has always been the 'keep everything Irish' type (her words not mine). And didn't like the idea of the baby having both a polish first and last name, (SIL took our last name). 
Well a few days after that, i got a strange text from SIL's younger sister (She's 20 i think) saying that i shouldn't have suggested a name and just let SIL think of her own name. She basically blamed me and my mom for giving SIL ideas. My parents got a few more calls and texts from SIL's parents saying that they better make SIL change her mind or 'else'. What ever that means. My brother and SIL assured my mom and i that they wouldn't blame us or change the name, stating that they were already planning on going low contact with SIL's family when the baby was born. and that this was just the final straw. 
But now i feel bad that i caused this whole thing to start. Ever since my SIL has gone low contact with her family, my parents and i have been receiving calls and texts saying that we caused this and influenced SIL to leave them. I've just been ignoring them, but the more there are the more i feel guilty. So aita for suggesting the name?",TL;DR,2024-07-25,"AITA For suggesting a baby name to my sister in law when she asked for one? i've never used reddit before so bare with me. I ,17f, have a brother (24). His wife, my SIL (23yrs old), is 5 months pregnant. Recently, both my brother and her came over to stay at my parents house for a few days. I haven't really met with her much due to them living a few states away and i was too busy with school to visit. But because it's summer break, i've been trying to form a relationship with her. 
She's a little shy and timid, but we get along super well as we share similar interests (baking, video games, movies, etc.) A few nights ago, my mom asked casually if my brother and SIL had settled on a name yet. They said no but said they wanted to find a name that has roots in our heritage. 
For context, my grandmother came over to the states from poland when she was a teenager. My mother grew up learning polish but not being taught how to properly speak it. She can say a few greetings and simple phrases like, ""How are you?"", ""What's for dinner?"", etc. But she always expressed how she wished she took the time to learn proper Polish. Well, recently i joined my mom to take a simple Polish class once a week. One of the firsts lessons was to identify common Polish names/ titles, so that we could get the accent down. 
Well, when my brother said he hoped to find a good Polish name, my mom perked up and said that if they needed help, she could always make a list. The next day, around noon, me and my mom where sitting on the couch watching TV when my SIL shuffled into the room. She sheepishly asked if we could help her with baby names. 
My mom and i where happy to help. After a few minutes of shuffling through a few names, i suggested Tomasz (Toe-Maz). My SIL's family all lives in Ireland and because Thomas is an irish name, having the polish version could be a nice blend of the cultures. SIL seemed to really like the name and thanked me and my mom.
Now here's where i don't really understand what happened. I guess shortly after, SIL texted my brother the name, he agreeed and said he liked it. Then after, SIL called the rest of her family and announced the name. I guess there was some sort of disagreement on the name or what version to use (??) and it ended in my SIL telling her family to ""suck it up and deal with it.""

89,1eby3h9,AITA for refusing to help my sister financially?,"My 35-year-old sister, a single mother of three from 3 different marriages, has lived in Sweden for 16 years. After marrying at 19, she occasionally sends a few hundred dollars to our parents. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, she’s faced business failures, tax evasion issues, and had a large sum of money confiscated.



Her second daughter had bruises and claimed they were from her third partner, who also S abused her. The school reported this, leading to a lawsuit. Despite breaking up with him, my sister considered reconciling. She borrowed about $3,000 from me with promises to repay, but didn’t. She ignored my inquiries while posting on Facebook.



She met a man who promised a ticket to Vietnam for New Year but didn’t deliver. I bought the ticket for her and her children. After returning nearly broke, she met a US man online, brought him to live with us, but broke up with him after he covered her expenses.



She was meant to return to Sweden but stayed in Vietnam. I lost the ticket money and covered her living expenses for five months, while also handling home renovations. My 69-year-old mother and aunt help support her, adding to the family tensions.



1st argument: The conflict started when my sister brought a new man from America into our home. Given her pattern of becoming involved with new people while still considering others, I jokingly commented on how long this relationship would last. She interpreted this as belittling and mocking, accusing me of disrespect.



2:  my sister's second daughter, who is often irritable, yelled at me for putting my feet on her chair. I responded with raised voices, leading my sister to reprimand me for being uncultured and uncivilized.

3: An argument erupted over my sister’s frequent purchases of unnecessary items despite our mother’s warnings about her lack of funds. My sister lashed out at our mother, calling her disrespectful and condescending.



4th: After my aunt bought bread without butter, my sister threw a tantrum, claiming the bread was for dogs. My mother went to get butter for her. Upset by the situation, I responded loudly when my sister asked about my moving plans. She saw this as disrespect and threatened to leave, accusing the family of not respecting her.



5th Argument: My sister often criticizes Vietnam, describing it as dirty and without a future, and belittles Vietnamese children. She also frequently compares her third husband unfavorably with previous partners, praising his manliness and respect.



6th Argument: She frequently threatens to leave Vietnam and sever all ties with the family, claiming that since our father’s death from COVID, she feels abandoned and views everyone in our house as strangers. She insists that if she leaves, she will cut off all contact and won’t care about our well-being.

She told me that those dresses made her look fat and triggered her past body dysmorphia and insecurities.

She asked me if she could modify her dress to define her figure, but I said all the bridesmaids had to wear the same dress and I didn’t want her to stand out.

It always felt like my parents were more understanding when he got a bad grade (encouraging him to try harder on the next exam) while if I got a grade below my average they got angry while criticizing that it was because I had not studied enough. 

Sudying has always been a source of pressure for me (I've had stress attacks, anxiety episodes and quite a few nights crying silently in the bathroom.) So my parents' opinion of my grades affects me quite a bit.

Now me and my brother are currently on summer break (he from highschool and I from university). The problem comes when my dad needs us to help him clean the house. He usually comes to ask for my help first and I help him if I can, it's important to note that he always comes to me first, never goes for my brother. One time he came to ask me to clean the kitchen while I was cleaning my room thoroughly and told him that I couldn't help him at the moment, he looked sad and went away. 

I didn't give much thought until a couple of seconds later, he came to ask me again. I told him I didn't wanna help him right now, since I was already busy cleaning my room and he started saying things like ""why wouldn't you help your father?"" or ""am I gonna have to clean the kitchen by myself.""

I was curious whether he would prepare them or not (because he never prepares them for me when he buys them) and he did not. They sat on the counter for an hour before I finally just prepared them.

So I thought it would be fun to put up posters on my wall of the movies I don't like as a reminder of the few exceptions to my cinematic horniness.I also think it would be fun to watch the collection grow as I watch more movies and see the increase of my taste level. However, when I told my bf(15m) he was appalled by the idea saying it would cause awkward encounters with the people who enter my room and see a film that they actually enjoy. Which I understand but I typically don't have people in my room very often. What made me start to question this was when said ""just sating, you'll look like a psychopath"" I knew that it was kind of out there but in my opinion calling me a psychopath was too far and insulting to call someone who has had mental health issues. I really wanted to argue with him and tell him not to call me that ever again but that would be our first fight and I thought maybe I should save it for a bigger issue. The reason I want to do this is because of the story behind it and my cinematic experience. But I don't want to do it if it makes me eligible for a mental hospital residency. I know there are people who have wierder things in their home and frankly it's not his room but I wanted to ask reddit, are my decor ideas really that crazy? Fyi I guess this is more am I the psychopath then am I the asshole.",0.0,1.0624750852584839,1,0
96,1ebwks3,AITA if I served expired chocolates and am not even sorry?,"There's a community of parents in our kindergarten (parents meaning mothers) who meet once in a while to do some work in the school garden, organize some activities for children etc. We were planning one such little kid show and it came to me to host the women in my house. They came over, it just happened to have been my birthday a couple of days ago, so I offered them a box of chocolates I received to go with the coffee. Most of them said no, they were on a diet, they did not eat chocolate, they only cared about congratulating me for my birthday and not about chocolate etc. 

After they left I put the chocolates away and ate one and thought, well, this is kind of meh (it did not taste bad or anything, just not very intense) and checked the back of the box and saw it expired 6 months ago. I thought: well, I guess grandpa was shopping in bulk again and had this box at home a little too long before giving it to me. I ate some more of the chocolates (they were not so bad) and threw the rest away. 

I went about my life and forgot about everything until yesterday (more than 2 months later) when one of the mothers from kindergarten stopped me when I was picking up my kid. She said: ""Sweetheart, I think it's time I told you why everyone's been giving you the cold shoulder."" 

(I didn't notice, I have a full time job and try to do as many activities with my children as possible, so I don't analyze whether someone says hello politely enough or whatever.) 

She continued: ""It's because what happened and how you gave us those expired sweets. It destroyed the trust we had in you and we were all very upset and discussed it a lot in the past months."" 

I stared at her because I was totally in shock she would bring up something so insignificant from a relatively long time ago. I came to my senses and thanked her for telling me and that I appreciated her honesty. 

I went home kind of in shock, not at my devious deception of these honest women, but at how petty I think this is even to mention? If this happened to me, I would just eat the chocolate, think well, this is kind of meh and never think about it again? Let alone DISCUSS it with the fellow victims? Oh yes, indeed, I too was taken advantage of by this evil hostess, let's form a support group. Accuse the host of destroying your trust? WTF. Not to mention they had to deliberately go and turn the box over when I was in the bathroom or something to find out the expiration date and confirm their worst fears. 

I did not do it on purpose, I never check the expiration honestly just as I know the person who gave the chocolates to me did not do it on purpose. I think they massively overreacted.

I (16m) live with him and I'm his oldest and only bio kid. But my cousins/raised as siblings also live with us. They're my dad's niece and nephew from his sister. She's a mess and not in their lives. My mom died when I was 7. 

Dad has dated a little since mom died. Never as serious as he is with Jess. I'm not sure if she's divorced, a widow or whatever. She has three kids too. Their dad isn't around as far as I know. They're closer to my cousins ages (11 and younger). Jess and dad were getting pretty serious and a few weeks ago they sat us all down and asked for our blessing to moved in together and get married. But they said they wanted it to be a unified effort and for us to come together as a family, not a blended family, to commit to being parents and kids, brothers and sisters, no steps or adopted mixed in. They said they do not want us to be ""that family"" where kids are steps and halfs and it's like they're not just family. The other kids were hell yeah.

We were long distance for three years, and he moved across the country to live with me. He got a job as a pharmaceutical technician about two months ago at (insert pharmacy chain store), and he chose the location because it was relatively close to my work (15 minutes). We are currently sharing my car, so his work being close to mine was a must. However, his work is on the opposite side of town, in a bad area, and almost 30 minutes away from home. 

This week, I got a new job making a lot more money (I'm a lawyer), and I'm really excited for this opportunity! It is also only 13 minutes away from home. However, it's in an opposite direction from my fiancé's job, turning a 13-minute commute into almost an hour. There are no bus stops close to us, so he would have to buy a bike and do a combination of biking and bus riding, and if he does buy one, there's a good chance it will be stolen considering where he works. 

I tried to talk to him about transferring stores or working at a different pharmacy, but he told me that he really likes his coworkers and he doesn't want to leave his job. I'm glad he's enjoying work, but practically, it makes more sense for him to work closer to my work, or at least closer to home. 

He got mad at me for pushing him about it and told me he's just going to buy a bike and ride the bus, even if it does take 1-2 hours.

I have apologised but she hasn’t, she just texted me a bit and tbh… I don’t feel like going but I know that not going means making things worse with our friendship and she will tell the others her version (which include personal issues with my bf). I have even thought of faking a fever.

The argument was because I acted clumsy at a moment I was overwhelmed (I went to her place for advice when she was busy) and she yelled at me through audio saying I was wrong and other things. She went too far from my and other friends’ view.

I have apologised but she hasn’t, she just texted me a bit and tbh… I don’t feel like going but I know that not going means making things worse with our friendship and she will tell the others her version (which include personal issues with my bf). I have even thought of faking a fever.

But I just don’t feel like it, it’s not pride. It’s different.

104,1ebuqfo,AITA for getting mad over the fact that my boyfriend went to the birthday of a friend but not mine,"I, 19 F, invited my boyfriend, 19 M (soon 20 M) to my birthday. This event was important to me because, well, it was my birthday, but it was also the first time since elementary school that I organized something with friends since I grew up pretty lonely. 

My boyfriend did not go to my birthday, not because he had something more important planned that day, he was completely free, but because he did not want to meet my friends, especially a guy friend he is jealous of and do not like, even if he had never met him, because he knows that he criticized him. 

I asked him several times if he really would not come because I really wanted him to, as this little party was important to me and I love him so I wanted him to be there. 
He insisted on the fact that he would not come.

I knew that the next day, a friend of his also celebrated his birthday. But he told me that he would not come because it would be disrespectul as he is not coming to my birthday and he was not really motivated to go. 
But the day after my birthday, he told me that he would go. It was a surprise party and the gf of his friend thought that there would be only 3 person so she begged him to come. So he did, bringing three friends of his so there would be more people. I was invited too so I came. Actually, even without him and the friends he brought, there would have been enough people. But the gf did not know that. 
I was really mad because he went to this birthday and not mine even though I am his girlfriend so I am supposed to be more important. He told me that if there were gonna be only 3 people at my party he would have come, that the circumptances were exceptional, that he would have felt uncomfortable around my friends and that l was allowed to not come to his birthday (later this year) for the same reason. But he is my boyfriend, even if I feel uncomfortable around his friends which will probably be the case since i have jealousy issues (I am working on them), I will come to his birthday because it's important. He understood why I was upset but he also told me to understand his pov.

105,1ebuoa3,AITA for kicking my cousin out of my apartment and threatening to call the cops?,"Sorry for the length.

I (28) kicked my little cousin (25) out of my apartment yesterday and I feel guilty about it. I agreed to let him stay with me “a week or 2” while he supposedly waited to move in with his girlfriend but I got fed up and told him to find somewhere else to stay. When he resisted, I started bringing his stuff outside and told him he needs to find somebody to come pick him up or I’m calling the cops.

My cousin has been struggling since adulthood and I feel for him but also, as I always tell him, it’s mostly self-inflicted. He struggles to find jobs due to record/background check issues and when he does, he blows it with outbursts or not being able to reliably get there or something goes wrong. He instead bounces from dream to dream to try and “make it big” whether it be basketball, boxing, and now, wrestling. Meanwhile he’s jobless, basically homeless and literally broke. He goes from friend to friend, girlfriend to girlfriend, and relative to relative to have a place to stay. His options seem to be running out because he came to me for the first time.

He spent the entire time at my apartment watching endless wrestling videos on his phone or my living room TV, talking on FaceTime (out loud with no headphones…), or listening to annoying rap music. I work from home and had to work from my secondary, more cramped desk area or in my bedroom instead of my living room desk where I usually work. And I have to be honest. It felt some type of way to work all day and then see him sitting on my couch watching WWE and talking on the phone all day long. Add on top of that all the food he was eating and that he drank up all my almond milk (like 3 half-gallons by himself), used all my protein powder, and knowing he wouldn’t be reimbursing me for any of this (he never pays anyone back for anything)…I was getting pretty annoyed.

I was very passively asking to try and confirm his plans with his girlfriend and was lowkey getting frustrated at how non-committal and non-chalant he was being. I kept asking for a specific day and time she was moving, even offering to help them with the move, and he wouldn’t give one. I started to think that he hasn’t actually worked out a plan with her yet or even worse, isn’t actually moving in with her at all. On top of this, I’m leaving for a trip with my parents and sister in a few days and of course I don’t want someone staying here while I’m gone.

He’s done similar things before with other people. He got kicked out of my aunt’s and grandparents’ houses for outbursts. In my grandparents’ case, they gave him til the end of a month to find somewhere else to go. He told them he had a place but then when the night came threw a fit, leading them to believe he hadn’t found a place like he said. They had to call the cops to get him to calm down and leave. I started to feel he was doing the same here so I ramped up the pressure and started asking more directly, and I admit more rudely, what the plan was with his girlfriend.

He wouldn’t give a straight answer and eventually asked why I was so keen on “getting rid of him”. I expressed my concern that he doesn’t actually have a plan to move in with this girl and told him that if he was thinking he could stay longer than what I agreed to, he was wrong.

He started yelling and was getting very angry and this was when I threatened to call the cops. My cousin has bad anger issues. He punched a hole in the wall in one of my aunt’s bedrooms which got him kicked out of there. He’s punched several different holes in the walls at my grandparents’ place during his time staying there and tried to break into their house in the middle of the night when they tried to lock him out after that month was up (hence the cop call). He even punched/attacked both of our older cousins at different points while they all lived there and one of them had to get stitches. So yes I was thinking about the possibility of him getting violent but I hoped the cop remark would keep him in check. 

I told him I’m not as lenient as his mom or our grandparents and that he needs to go. And that’s when I started bringing his stuff outside and putting it all outside my front door. I told him if he can’t tell me exactly when that girl is moving to her apartment and coming to get him, he needs to call her or a friend or something and get picked up right now then. And that if he punches a wall or does anything violent, I’m not gonna bother fighting him or trying to reason with him like my grandparents and cousins did. I’ll just call my apartment security and the cops.

He did eventually calm down and got some guy to come get him and his stuff and then sent me a long email (he doesn’t have a phone plan to text) about how I’m “just like the rest of the family” and don’t believe in him or support him, that I “got mine” and don’t care about him, etc. 

I feel bad about it all. Most of my family is extremely fed up with him and refuse to let him stay with them. He’s always looked to me for advice and support and I know he in a way looks up to me. He has a lot of problems emotionally and honestly mentally too. I don’t want him to think I gave up on him or something…but man my rent is $1800. I have bills and expenses and debts. I make a good enough salary to support myself without worry sure but the budget is tight still. I can’t afford to and don’t want to have someone staying with me for free for very long especially when they have no foreseeable plan to contribute anything or pay me back or even leave.

His last comment that really ticked me off was when he called me an empty shell of a human being.

I went berserk. 

I used to like painting until he said he won't buy me more paint because i'm wasting it on garbage art that looks awful. (This was literally my second time painting, I was 8)

I used to like baking and he told me my baking was burnt and nasty (it wasn't burnt; me and my neighbours that i gave some of the baked goods to loved it.)

I used to like cooking and my mom said it wasn't good and I probably should stop before i poisoned them (they had a good laugh at my moms 'joke')

I used to like sewing and my mom said she wouldn't teach me since there's no point and I'd end up quitting anyways (she's referring to my other hobbies that i gave up but i had reasons for it.)

I liked skip roping, basketball. I liked dress designing, I liked embroidery. I liked hairstyling and doing nails. I liked writing novels and books in general, i was interested in ballet, gymnastics too. I liked writing poems. I had so many things I liked doing.

I was in 3 clubs (FMP: future medical profession club, baking club, photography club) before my dad told me he wouldn't drive me anymore because it's too much work and i should study more instead.

I had to cancel plans because my parents wouldn’t allow me to go out with friends.

I had interest in cardiovascular medicine and they told me i was too stupid for it, too stupid to also do engineering, how i’d never make it as a scientist. writing doesn’t pay enough, and my designs are ugly so no one would buy clothes i make etc.

they ruined my interests and now they are upset i have none.

i no longer have the interest to go out with friends or do anything quite literally.
 
At the end of this i was crying. Genuinely in shambles. My parents were shocked and just didn’t say anything.

i got up and went to my room and called my friend to vent, she basically told me that she understood what i meant but i can’t speak to my parents that way and that they want the best for me, that they were looking out so i didn’t waste time on unnecessary hobbies that would do me no good.

i hung up on her and texted the group chat and i basically got the same response. Am i going insane? i still don’t think im wrong at all?

110,1ebttx0,AITA for asking my roommate's friend to compensate me for the expenses i made on my apartment?,"I (20F) recently graduated and moved back home after staying in a different city for college. I stayed in an apartment with three other females, two of which will continue staying in the apartment as they are not yet done with their studies. My roommate (i'll call her sarah for convenience) was a good friend for the first few months but during the last three months or so, she became EXTREMELY rude and inconsiderate to a point where she would ignore all other roommates, throw sand in my closet and laptop and I even found my electronics in the garbage one day.

As they wished to continue with the lease, we found replacements for me and the other girl who was leaving. the girl replacing me is Sarah's best friend (Kate). she has been generally nice to me but I am afraid sarah has manipulated her and fed her lies about what went down between the two of us.

(it is not common in my country for students to work while studying).

kate is now claiming that some of the things that i am asking her to pay for are not present in the apartment even though i have confirmed with the other flatmates that they are indeed there. the house equipment and utensils alone cost around $25 and i can agree to her paying me a lesser amount for these things but she is trying to drive the amount down by making baseless arguments. (She is trying to get the price down to about $30 instead of $100).

i am supposed to speak to her regarding this tonight but im afraid sarah will involve herself into the situation. they are both law students making them very good at arguing (sarah is extremely overpowering and prides herself in being manipulative) and kate's father is a lawyer by profession so i do not want this to go legal.

I (20F) recently graduated and moved back home after staying in a different city for college.

My roommate (i'll call her sarah for convenience) was a good friend for the first few months but during the last three months or so, she became EXTREMELY rude and inconsiderate to a point where she would ignore all other roommates, throw sand in my closet and laptop and I even found my electronics in the garbage one day.

112,1ebsy1l,AITA for removing myself from a conversation that I don't feel comfortable with?,"
I (22M) had an argument with my girlfriend (21F) yesterday/today. In the evening she went out partying with a friend. One or two hours into it she asked if her wallet is at home, but I couldn't find it. I asked if I should come there and help search and she just said ""maybe"", after 10min, maybe less, she texted me that she found it but without card and id. I asked her again if I should come over there to support her and she just said ""idk man"", half a minute later sent me a number to block her card and asked if I can call them. As I was calling she texted me again (it was like 1min later) and asked me if I'm on my way yet. I told her no but I can come right now. She then said wtf and stuff like ""is this not important enough for you?"", ""can't you call while on the way here?"", ""are you for real?"". I don't know why she got so mad because I wasn't sure if I'm still needed there. (this all happened in less than 25min)

That really stressed me out, I rushed to put on some clothes, ran out the door and realized I left the keys inside. My girlfriend also didn't bring a key because I was supposed to be home. I told her and when her friend called me, she took the phone and got mad at me, cussed me out, said stuff like ""how can you be so fucking stupid"", ""how can you be so dumb"", ""you're so shitty"", all kinds of insults, so I said I'm not talking to her unless she stops yelling and insulting me, she got mad at me for that too.

After that I still asked her if I should come there or if it's okay if I call a locksmith, she said to do that and that's it.

After that we didn't text a lot, except me checking in once. Around 4:30am they came home and when they did I asked my girlfriend if they can both sleep in the bedroom so I can sleep on the couch. I also told her that I am too emotional right now to have a talk about this, that she is also too drunk and emotional and I don't want to be yelled at, so I want to distance myself from the situation and clear my head.

She started arguing that I put my feelings above hers, that I'm unsupportive, that we never agreed that it would be okay to push an argument like that into the next day, when we actually talked about that in the past. I tried to be as calm as possible, but she was disrespectful and kept repeating herself. Because of that I tried to interrupt her to tell her I am really not having this conversation right now. After the third time of trying to get a word out she yelled at me to shut the fuck up and that was it for me. I told her enough, she won't talk to me like that and that I will be leaving. 

I grabbed some clothes and went outside for a walk. She sent me an audio where she was gaslighting me and lying about the things I said, then a few minutes later said she's breaking up with me. She said some more hurtful things over text to me, told me I was inconsiderate, I should care more about the people in my surroundings and so on.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-25,"AITA for removing myself from a conversation that I don't feel comfortable with?

Mom talked to me about the why and what can she do to make me feel like I can drop them. She has told me using them won't make me suddenly have a bio dad (he didn't want a kid so he left mom when she was pregnant).

Her husband told his daughter I'm her big brother so she was getting upset that I'd say stepsister, because she learned about it in school like last year and she was upset because step means not real, which is how SHE said it.

It's been such a big fight for the past five years and my mom has given up. She told me I need to go and live with my grandparents. I said fine. My grandparents were eager to have me live with them. Then mom got mad at me and told me I'm making her do this and I should be willing to compromise and work on a solution for me to stay.

She responds”go get them back” 

I asked her if she could compromise
 She said nope.

So I’m begging my boss for hours. Now I look bad to my workplace. 
Hopefully I get them back 

Am I in the wrong?

Edit: originally I just said I couldn’t come to the city and explained why.

She was mad at me for that.

I then explained she didn’t tell me , and couldn’t go to the city.

She then said she was pissed as I told her I took the days off to spend with her and now I can’t come, but it’s not all her fault.

* She often leaves underwear with heavy blood just on the bedroom or bathroom floor
* If she's had to resort to using toilet roll it's sometimes left in the toilet without flushing

The children in therapy with her are her 15 year old son and 13 year old daughter. She plans to go with her 12 year old son later as well. But does not want him involved in therapy with the 15 and 13 year old. The reason for therapy is her husband is her second husband, her first passed away 7 years ago. She remarried 4 years ago and has an almost 4 year old and an almost 1 year old with her husband. Her children from her first marriage have not taken to her younger kids like she had hoped. Not mean but indifferent? She says there's no showing of affection at all to the younger kids and it's concerning.

During therapy some weeks ago she asked her son (15) if he loved his two (full) siblings more than his two (half) siblings. The therapist stepped in and told my sister it wasn't the right question and she should refrain from asking questions where the answers can be taken very unfavorably by the asking party. My sister ended up arguing with the therapist over this for the last 3 or 4 weeks. A week ago or thereabouts her son told her the answer to the question is yes, he will always prefer his full siblings. The therapist wasn't happy with my sister holding onto this question because of course, she didn't like the answer and she told her this was very clearly coming.

My sister has bad blood with the therapist now. She has complained about her non-stop for two weeks. She was outraged that the therapist dared tell her not to ask questions and described it as the wrong one. I told her the therapist was right. My sister asked how.

i was  quite confused as I have never been in any sort of public conflict, i don’t say anything at first, and she’s still telling me to move, which I do, I move back around few steps, like 5 or something, despite this she was still having a go at me and her tone was becoming a lot more aggressive, I try telling her that “I’ve done nothing wrong and that it’s not that deep”, now this is where I messed up by undermining her feelings by implying she’s overreacting.

However, A was completely silent. After a pause, she said ""Well, I'm probably gonna end up telling my Mum."" At first I thought she was joking, but her serious expression made it clear that she wasn't.

She's my mother's older sister's daughter, and though she and I don't communicate much over the phone, we get along extremely well when we do get to see each other. We've lived in different states all our lives, but she's probably the one I get along with best amongst all my cousins.

Which is why I'm genuinely feeling horrible about this. I have phonophobia (fear of loud sounds like firecrackers) and I have always had it since I was a baby. I don't know what caused it, just that every year my country celebrates Diwali (for those of you don't know, its the Hindu festival of lights and they burst crackers all day every day for 2-3 weeks atleast) I have to cocoon myself in a corner of my room and jam my ears with loud music and headphones. I've suffered from this a lot my entire life, and I had to work a lot to just stop crying from the torture of having to hear fireworks. and when I was younger my parents were very unsympathetic towards me about it, they ranged from calling me a coward, a scaredy cat, pathetic, to purposefully baring my ears to surroundings where firecrackers are being burst, not letting me listen to my music when I'm scared, etc. They even joked about my phobia to extended family causing THEM in turn to give me unsolicited advice about how sound won't physically harm me, I'm not being brave enough, yk the usual boomer complaints.

But my parents wanted to honor him, mom specifically, and she decided Arthur was perfect because it was ""vintage"" unlike grandpa's first name.

I hated my name always. Sometimes I get teased for having a grandpa name. Not as much anymore because old names are being used more for younger kids. But when I was younger it got really bad. My friends helped me come up with a nickname to use instead. It's Dex. When I meet people I tell them my name is Dex. Teachers call me Dex, my friends and everyone at school calls me Dex, neighbors call me Dex. My dad calls me Dex. So does grandpa. But my mom? She's really mad that I use Dex all the time now. She argued that Artie would be better as juvenile as that is. I told her that's not any better than Arthur. Mom said Arthur looks so much better than Dex on documents and at work. I told her she can change her name to Arthur then.

Lately it's been really bad. She heard me and grandpa talk about how I want to change my name and grandpa told me he'd make that my 18th birthday gift, giving me the money to have it changed. I told him that was great because I really wanted to get rid of Arthur. Grandpa told me he felt the same way. He also said Arthur had been his grandfather's first name. That's why it was his middle name. He had hoped it would end with him.

Mom came at me when we got home from my grandparents house and she told me I was not changing my name to Dex. She said I have a perfectly good name, not something like Dex, which isn't even a real name. I told her I'd rather have a fake name than Arthur. She told me to go by Michael then. But changing my name in three years is disrespectful and she raised me to be better. She told me my name is fashionable now (like I care) and that I shouldn't take people named Ryder, Sonny, Brycen and Indigo seriously. I told her not to insult my friends names. She told me not to insult her. Dad had to step in and told mom to stop. Mom said I was fighting with my own mother over a nickname and it shows how disrespectful I am.

I (41F) live with my mother (78) and father (76), I help take care of them as my mother is blind and my father rather frail. I work from home and am able to pick my hours so I am available most days to help them out with chores, driving places, etc etc.

Today was a working day for me. My room is my office, and I tend to keep my door and window open so I can get a breeze, or else my room gets really stuffy and I get too hot.

My dad dropped in to say hello, which is fine, but he kinda lingered. I was polite, but continued on with my work. He then asked me why I was in a bad mood. I said I wasn't in a bad mood, I'm just busy. He then proceeded to continue asking me why I was in a bad mood. I continued to insist I wasn't in a bad mood, I was just busy and trying to work.

Unfortunately, his insistence that I apparently didn't know my own feelings started to annoy me. So I snapped at him, telling him I wasn't initially angry but he was frustrating me, and to please leave as I was busy and working.

So now I'm the bad guy, because he was ""just wanting to make sure I was ok"" and I yelled at him. So AITA?

And for the record, he's been doing this to both me and my mom for decades, so this isn't some kind of old-age dementia or Alzheimer's or whatever. While he may not be physically very strong, his mental acuity is still sharp.

My sister didn't see it coming despite warnings that it could happen because she went behind his back. The story basically goes, she married him knowing he had absolutely no interest in having his mom, stepdad or half siblings in his life. He didn't like his stepdad. He didn't want half siblings. That was something everyone in our family knew. He was open about having no desire for contact. My sister married him, had kids with him, and then decided he was wrong to deny his family for being steps and halfs, so she was making contact and introducing the kids behind his back. She argued with him when he found out and said if nobody else, his half siblings deserves to be included because they're the most innocent in his family. They didn't ask to be born and weren't a part of any of the wrongs his mom and stepdad did. He told her he wanted nothing to do with them and they weren't his real siblings anyway. He also told her she had gone behind his back and betrayed his trust and he was not going to stand for it or allow their kids to see ""that man"" as grandpa or ""those kids"" as aunts and uncles.

My sister doesn't want her marriage to end but has also been pissed at her husband because he's ""correcting"" stuff she told their kids about the stepdad and half siblings and has told their kids they (stepdad, half siblings) are not family and stuff. She's mad at him for that because the kids are more resistant now to contact with their paternal side and don't call them grandparents/aunts/uncles anymore. But she also doesn't want to divorce her husband.

It's a mess. It's crazy. My parents are encouraging her to open up and stuff. To talk about it. I'm less sympathetic and patient. It's six months on from him filing and I can't be around my extended family without hearing about this. My sister goes from badmouthing her husband to saying she hopes he calls off the divorce and they can work out and be a family again.

My sister also tries to talk to me just 1:1 about it. I think my reason for being so indifferent to this, annoyed about hearing it, is because she knew how he felt. She knew what his boundaries were re: his family. She had a choice not to marry him. She had a choice not to go behind his back.

I do, however, feel bad for the kids caught in the middle.

Friend #3 who’s also been apart of this childhood friend group told me friend #1 thinks I’m upset with her, which I’m not life has just been busy. I’ve also reconnected with a couple of other old friends from high school and trying to hang out with them more since our schedules line up better. 

I’m unsure whether or not I should just let the friendship fizzle out or try to continue the friendship between friend 1 and 2. I feel bad for not messaging them and checking up on them these last few weeks but they’ve never really done the same to me in the 11 years we’ve been friends. Am I the a**hole?

126,1ebpd0m,AITA for telling my mom she shouldn't have housed her family after a storm?,"My mom comes from a big family - she has 7 siblings and was raised mostly by my grandfather. At some point, my grandfather became sick and she became the sole carer for him despite her siblings all living in the same house. Soon, she and my grandfather started their own business and managed to thrive off of it, which I think her siblings held some resentment against her claiming it was ""favoritism"". When my grandfather died, the will gave my mom the company and some land, while the other siblings got some small pieces of land.

The thing is, when this all happened, her siblings all ganged up on her and started lynching her and basically ripped her off for her part of the will. She lost the house we all lived in taking care of my grandfather along with land titled to her, but managed to keep the company. So they lynched her then cut her off. Using resources that were rightfully hers, some of them started their own small companies that competed with ours. Mom basically lost everything. Fast forward a few years later my mom got back on her feet and we're living relatively well off, especially because us siblings have worked hard to support each other.

A storm recently passed by our area and it devastated a lot of people, and one of the siblings with their family came to our house with a bunch of clothes and stuff. We recently renovated the house so we have some spare rooms since my siblings all moved out too, but I got into a bit of a heated discussion with my mom when I told her she should've turned them away to go to one of the government's evacuation sites. I told her *they* turned her away, took her rightful land, and basically spoke ill of her to everyone. I said where are the other siblings that helped them lynch her? They can go to them.

She needed them to help with grandad's sickness and they didn't do anything, then got mad when she got the company and land. I didn't think they deserved her grace and forgiveness. The two of us even went out *during* the storm to buy groceries because we didn't have enough for everyone. It also seems like they don't have plans to leave anytime soon despite the storm being gone and the areas have been cleared already. I feel like they're leeching off my mom's kindness when they didn't show her any.

She said we should feel bad for them because of the storm, but they didn't feel bad for her when they basically threw her out. My dad's on my side.

We heard rolling loud was coming to our city for the first time and were super excited and bought tickets like 6 months in advance, and we planned on going with each other only but if we happened to see people we knew there then that would be fine. 

A couple months after we bought the tickets she tells me she doesn’t want to go anymore and she’s selling the tickets. I’m pissed because i don’t feel safe going to things like that alone and i didn’t have anyone in mind to go with at the time. I keep my ticket though because i figured I’d regret not seeing it. 

Over the next couple of months i made a new friend (let’s call her T) and she was planning on going alone too so we decided to go together and i thought everything worked out. I didn’t mention this to my friend because to my knowledge she wasn’t going and didn’t have tickets so it would be useless info for her. 

A couple days before the festival my friend msgs me saying hey when can i pick you up to go? I’m like ….. you told me you sold your ticket and weren’t going so i made plans to go with another friend (T), you can join us if you want. My friend was pissed when i said i wouldn’t go with only her for any of the 3 days. This is where idk if AITA because maybe i could have put in more effort to spend time with her atleast one of the days but she didn’t want to join me and T and i would not want to put T in the position my friend put me in so we just ended up not spending any time with eachother during it. 

We talked a couple months after about it and she was still mad, and said i should have spent at least one of the days with just her. I told her you were fine with leaving me to go by myself in the first place so whats the problem? AITA?

My mom has always done her best to never speak poorly about my dad whenever I am around. I visit my dad and step-mom every summer. In the past, I have been bad at expressing myself and making boundaries. If something was said about my mom that made me uncomfortable, I just wouldn't comment. About a year ago, I started to practice making boundaries more often and trying to prioritize my emotions more. In the past year, I set a boundary with both my dad and step-mom and said that I would appreciate it if no bad comments were made about mom near me. They agreed not to.

My mom is disabled. She has days where she is in constant pain and she still holds her temper, and does her best to be a good mom to me and my bro who both have our own mental disorders that she has helped us with. She has always been understanding and does not undermine our feelings. My dad and step-mom haven't always been the same. The other day, my dad and I were watching a show where a character became paraplegic. I spoke up, expressing my sympathy and saying that I hoped he would come to a point where he could miss his old self, but still adjust to his new self. My dad said, ""That's all so true. Unfortunately, some people like being the victim. Even if they don't know it."" I felt that that comment was heavily targeted towards my mom (who has never referred to herself as a victim, nor acted like one). I froze in the moment and didn't say anything, because like I said, Im still working on the communicating thing; it gives me intense anxiety, to the point of anxiety attacks. Obviously I want to stand up for my mom who has done so much for me.

Later, I couldn't sleep due to the guilt of not saying anything. So, I sent a text to my dad, something that he has suggested me doing in the past. The text said, ""Hey, I'm not trying to make this a big deal, but earlier today when I was talking about Manny on Baywatch, you made some comments like, 'quote stated above', that felt really targeted towards mom.

132,1ebo5a5,AITA for asking my room mates girlfriend to contribute to rent?,"My partner and I live in an apartment, and our room mate is my partners younger brother. We all currently pay $193/week for rent. 

Over the last 6 months, he has had a new girlfriend who has been coming over consistently every week for around 2-4 days each week. 

Since she basically lives with us for a few days each week (using electricity, water, using kitchen, fridge, all of our stuff) we figured it would be fair for her to contribute. 

After some maths (our rent divided by 4) we thought $20 a night would be fair so it would  be $40 per week that she comes over. This is compared to the $173 that each of us would be paying each week (plus bills), and her $40 would include paying for all bills so that’s all she needs to pay. 

Keep in mind she doesn’t pay any of her own bills or rent as her parents pay for all of this. She has a job with almost full time hours so she can definitely afford $40/week. 

They have responded and don’t believe that paying per night is fair. Instead they want to split all bills by 4, and she would cover a quarter of all monthly bills. I’m not opposed to this, but we have just got a $1000 government grant so we don’t have any out of pocket expenses for electricity for the next 6 months, so her cost for electricity will be 0. I don’t think it’s fair to her also to take advantage of our credit. If we take this route, she will be only be paying $40/month ($10 per week) compared to the $40/week we proposed which I think is too low. 

What do you think is fair? Am I caring about this too much? 

TLDR: Do you think it’s fair to charge my roommates girlfriend $40 per week to stay at our house 2-4 days per week? 

",Asshole,2024-07-25,"AITA for asking my room mates girlfriend to contribute to rent? My partner and I live in an apartment, and our room mate is my partners younger brother. We all currently pay $193/week for rent. 

Over the last 6 months, he has had a new girlfriend who has been coming over consistently every week for around 2-4 days each week. 

Since she basically lives with us for a few days each week (using electricity, water, using kitchen, fridge, all of our stuff) we figured it would be fair for her to contribute. 

After some maths (our rent divided by 4) we thought $20 a night would be fair so it would  be $40 per week that she comes over. This is compared to the $173 that each of us would be paying each week (plus bills), and her $40 would include paying for all bills so that’s all she needs to pay. 

Keep in mind she doesn’t pay any of her own bills or rent as her parents pay for all of this. She has a job with almost full time hours so she can definitely afford $40/week. 

They have responded and don’t believe that paying per night is fair. Instead they want to split all bills by 4, and she would cover a quarter of all monthly bills. I’m not opposed to this, but we have just got a $1000 government grant so we don’t have any out of pocket expenses for electricity for the next 6 months, so her cost for electricity will be 0. I don’t think it’s fair to her also to take advantage of our credit. If we take this route, she will be only be paying $40/month ($10 per week) compared to the $40/week we proposed which I think is too low. 

What do you think is fair? Am I caring about this too much?

133,1ebnt5e,AITA? Wanting to receive random compliments in long term relationship ,"I (20F) have been dating my boyfriend (20M) for the past 2 and a half years. As we have grown closer to each other and spend most nights of the week together, Ive noticed some changes. Some are a given when you spend so much time around a person- you have less to talk about, you become accustomed to silence, etc. But what Im strugling with is a topic that has come up twice this past week. I have noticed I have been receiving significantly less attention and, notably, almost never receive compliments. This wasn’t a problem at the beginning of our relationship- he would always compliment my looks and tell me how pretty I am or say that he likes my outfits and so on. I brought up that I have noticed he doesn’t compliment me anymore, and how I would like him to try to start doing it again more often. I explained that I wasn’t asking for anything crazy, just that I wanted to hear him say that he thinks I look pretty or compliment my outfit or anything random like that. He was very confused and seemingly annoyed, saying that he is ‘not a mind reader’ and me expecting to receive compliments every now and again is ‘unfair’. He said that I must specifically tell him when I want complimented, and I must also say what I want the compliment to be about. He explained that all I have to do is ask, while I think he is missing the point. I explained I wanted the compliments to be random, at literally any point of the day, focusing on how I want to be told I’m pretty. He emphasized how I was being unfair, and how I must tell him exactly when and how I want to be complimented. While I understand this reason if it were something very specific, I don’t think being asked to be called pretty is that much to ask.

135,1ebnbqd,AITA for planning my dads funeral?,"AITA for planning my dads funeral?

Me (27F) and my sister (29F) got a phone call from our cousin on Monday this week that our dad passed away unexpectedly. He lived in the midwest and my sister and I live in the southwest in different states. Nobody knew of any health issues or anything going on, and he was supposed to show up for work on Monday. My uncle went to his apartment and broke down the door to find him unresponsive. They called me to let me know and i called my sister to let her know. My cousin told me his family would find a funeral home to do the service and that they would give my info to the cops/medical examiner so they could tell me what was going on. 

Its been 72 hours since I heard the news, and I set up a GoFundMe to help with funeral costs (since we wanted to get it done asap we aren’t sure the insurance would pay for it yet). My sister and I have been scrambling to figure out plans and also ask my dads sister what she thinks would be best for cremation/burial etc. My sister and I are the only ones on the will and on really any documents to determine what to do for him. 

At first, my aunt said we should cremate him and have his ashes in his town as well as his hometown (halfway across the world). Not 24 hours later she changed her mind and said she wants a proper burial with a priest and everything. I had also asked multiple times for her to give me info of the funeral home she talked to so I could set up the date and get funding to them (she never sent me details).

Cut to today, my mom calls me (my parents have been divorced for almost 2 decades at this point) and says my aunt called her and bitched her out about the fact I set up a GoFundMe (even though my other cousins asked for me to set up a way for donations) and said I haven’t done anything with the funeral home plans and that we are “dropping the ball” on everything. They also want us to instead of cremate, send our dads body back to his home country and bury him there. They told MY MOM (who again didn’t have anything to do with my dad at this point) that we shouldn’t even be a part of any of the process. It has been not 3 days since he died and while we are trying to figure out everything else and getting the death certificate on top of planning a trip halfway across the country we have been working our asses off trying to coordinate with everyone. 

We are the only ones on the will. The will doesn’t state specifics on what he wanted post death. We are trying our best while also grieving the loss of our father. Im grasping at straws here trying to not drink myself into oblivion because he was my best friend. We have a million things to coordinate and figure out as this is all new to us. But according to family we need to have everything figured out in 20 seconds or else.

136,1ebmy0x,AITA for telling my friend it’s her fault she keeps getting her heart broken?,"My (20F) friend (20F) grew up rich and essentially got whatever she asked for. I’ve been to her house and met her parents, and it’s very evident that she’s been pampered her whole life and has basically never been told no. I mention this because there have been many situations where things don’t go her way, and she wounds up crying and even gets close to throwing a tantrum.

In terms of getting her heart broken, she will start talking to someone, but they will tell her that they aren’t as interested as she is, or don’t mind talking but don’t want to make things official. However, in her mind she’ll believe the situation will somehow eventually go her way. For example about 6 months ago, she started talking to someone, but they clearly said they don’t want anything serious. For whatever reason, though, she believed that they will eventually end up dating and even talked about the person as if they were dating, along with doing over the top things (planning their future wedding, etc.)

This has happened about 4 times now, and each time when things end between them, she will go on a long 2 hour rant about men, along with how she keeps getting her heart broken. Last week this happened again, and I finally told her that the reason she keeps getting her heart broken is because her expectations are too high. I also told her that she needs to change her mindset by not assuming things will change when the person has already revealed they don’t want anything serious.

She then starts telling me that i’m putting all the blame on her and that i’m not on her side. I told her that at this point, she’s made the same mistake four times, and it doesn’t make sense doing the same thing but expecting different outcomes. I assured her I’m there talk, but this is the fourth time and it’s too much.

137,1ebms51,"WIBTA for ""ruining"" my friends future?","Fake names and a throwaway account

So my friend, Sophie (17F) invited me (17F) and one other friend, Petunia, (17F) to her vacation house (would be an international trip) for our high school graduation. We are part of a small friend group of 5 people, and then a larger one with 15ish people. The problem is, I don't like Sophie and she doesn't like me. Like every time we are in the same room we fight about something, and she always ends up crying once someone else agrees with me/I make a better argument. So I get scolded by some of my other friends (99% of the time Petunia) for not being sensitive enough (this girl has yelled at me, complained about me behind my back, etc.) when I literally always make sure to keep my voice level and soft and never accusative.

Now I'm reconsidering going on that grad trip with both of them. I'm already going to East Asia with them and 10 of my other friends as a big grad trip, and this was just meant to be a small one with the three of us. One of my close friends, Emily, told me that I'm an AH by ditching premade plans because I would be ruining somebody else's paid vacation knowingly, when I should have mentioned it when I was invited. Also another friend who Emily had told my plan to ( who is closer to Sophie) told me that Sophie needed me to come so that she could show her grandparents that she had better friends than her brother did. Her grandparents had withdrawn their offer to pay for her college once they found out she was lesbian, and this trip was partially a way to fix that. (Her brother had the same problem but instead of being gay he was an addict, and their grandparents paid for his tuition after they met him) Basically, if I don't show up, I might be messing with Sophies future and if I, knowing that, still refused to go, I'm a terrible person.

Also couple details I might have forgotten: I haven't agreed to anything yet, I've just said that it's really cool that she was gonna take us there. (no dates or payments were finalized) Also, I've know Petunia for mb 15 years and she's known Sophie for about 2 years.

Tldr: Don't wanna go on a grad trip planned by two friends, but wanna plan another one with the rest of the friend group that excludes them. Also, hoping to find a place close enough to provoke one into annoying the other and maybe ruining her vacation.

Edit: Just clarifying that the East Asia trip is confirmed for the start of summer, and the secondary trip would either be Sophie's house or one that I plan myself, happening after the East Asia one is done.

139,1ebmnw0,WIBTA - Wedding Guests Oh My!,"So, me (26F) and my fiance (26M), we'll call him Josh,  are currently wedding planning and making a guest list. My Dad (Ken) has a girlfriend (Tara) who he has been with for about six years, she's a lovely lady and we get along well. My issue is, my Dad and I are not super close, we talk at least once a week, but growing up he wasn't really around and had a lot of issues. He also is pretty much a 'my way or the highway' kind of guy, and doesn't like not getting his own way. This relationship is the most serious one he's had my entire life, and he seems genuinely happy and has grown a lot as a person since being with Tara. 

  
Regarding the guest list, my Dad, Tara, and Tara's adult daughter are absolutely invited and considered family with seating at a nice table etc. But my concern is regarding Tara's extended family. My dad considers her family (Tara's parents, sister's, neices etc.) to be his family too, he's very close with them and spends a lot of time with them. However, because they've only been together since I've been an adult, and I don't spend a lot of time with my Dad, I don't really know these people beyond polite conversation at Birthday's/Christmas etc. I do not speak to any of them outside of these occasions, and I don't even know half of their names (this is exactly the same for them to me). 



The conversation hasn't come up yet, but I am sure my Dad will be offended if I don't invite at least Tara's parents. Me and Josh have 2 young kids, and my Dad makes a point of telling them to call Tara's parents 'Granny' and 'Grandpa' (my kids don't lol). He always speaks about them as though they are MY family, and as though I should know the ins and outs of their lives. Once again, Tara's family also don't view me in this way, it is literally just my Dad. 

  
Josh and I have decided we are not inviting any of them. It's not a cost issue, we could afford it, and we have space, and we don't dislike them, it's more a matter of we don't have a relationship with these people and don't care to have random people there on a day that is meant to be about us and celebrating with our loved ones. For reference, we are inviting any guests to have +1 if they are coming alone, or are a close friend with a long term partner even if we don't know them. I feel this is different because that's more at the benefit of our friends who may not know other guests, so at least they aren't alone. 

  
Not that this would affect my decision, but my Dad isn't contributing anything financially to the wedding, and has been a dick to Josh in the past so I don't particularly feel generous to accommodate him lol.

However, because they've only been together since I've been an adult, and I don't spend a lot of time with my Dad, I don't really know these people beyond polite conversation at Birthday's/Christmas etc. I do not speak to any of them outside of these occasions, and I don't even know half of their names (this is exactly the same for them to me). 



The conversation hasn't come up yet, but I am sure my Dad will be offended if I don't invite at least Tara's parents. Me and Josh have 2 young kids, and my Dad makes a point of telling them to call Tara's parents 'Granny' and 'Grandpa' (my kids don't lol). He always speaks about them as though they are MY family, and as though I should know the ins and outs of their lives. Once again, Tara's family also don't view me in this way, it is literally just my Dad. 

  
Josh and I have decided we are not inviting any of them. It's not a cost issue, we could afford it, and we have space, and we don't dislike them, it's more a matter of we don't have a relationship with these people and don't care to have random people there on a day that is meant to be about us and celebrating with our loved ones. For reference, we are inviting any guests to have +1 if they are coming alone, or are a close friend with a long term partner even if we don't know them. I feel this is different because that's more at the benefit of our friends who may not know other guests, so at least they aren't alone. 

  
Not that this would affect my decision, but my Dad isn't contributing anything financially to the wedding, and has been a dick to Josh in the past so I don't particularly feel generous to accommodate him lol. 

  
TLDR: WIBTA if I don't invite my Dad's girlfriend's parents - who I don't really know well or have a relationship with - to my wedding because my Dad considers them his family and would want them there.",0.0,0.04442828893661499,0,1
140,1ebmmmn,WIBTA If I changed the locks on my Ex?,"Ex and I were doing long distance, going into the 8th month. It was hard, but we’ve been talking about marriage and our plans to get her to move to where I was. We were making it work up until 4 weeks ago. 

After my last trip seeing them, we were in a bit of a rough place, however, I was going too see them again in 4 weeks for a quick trip. 2 weeks after I left, I got a call. They kissed someone else on a night out. Colleague crush. We discussed this a couple of days after finding this out, had a hard conversation, but ended up planning for me to stay longer than I intended during my next visit, to work on our relationship. 

Weekend after, they asked for space. They had been thinking about what they wanted, and felt that they had flipped their whole life around. How they were living in my home, surrounded by my things, and it didn’t feel like they had a life anymore. 

The weekend before my return, they went out drinking a few times, and I didn’t really hear from them. One of those days though, their friend was having a party, and they asked how big “our” TV was in order to take it to said party, even though I had bought it before we had even met. 

3 days before my return, they broke up with me. They mentioned that this trip would be a bad idea, and that I should just cancel it, or not stay the week. The tickets were bought however, and I wasn’t going to pay to change them. 

Upon my return, they met me at the door and gave me one key, the one to my apartment, and left. I realised that I wasn’t given the key to actually enter the building, and quickly went to the door to ask for it, and was met with “I don’t give a shit how you get into that door, I live here, I pay rent, you fucking figure it out”. Luckily, I sorted it out. Once I got into my apartment, there was enough evidence to see that their crush and them had been spending time in my apartment, even before they actually broke up with me. More with the building CCTV.

I’m pretty much half way through my visit now, haven’t seen them since I arrived, and the only conversations we had were to ask me to leave earlier, that they just want to be home, and how their life and work has been difficult not being at home. There was even an accusation that I was staying here longer to either spite them, or in hope that we would get back together. 

The disrespect and feelings I felt to know my apartment was used for the affair/dates, sleeping together in my bed, watching my TV, I can’t even explain it. I know if I change the locks and pack their stuff, I’ll be blowing up their life, but if I don't, I'd know once I left they would just continue using my things? They aren’t on the lease, we just had a verbal agreement on the rent, they pay 60% of it and their main possessions are clothes.

141,1ebmb0t,AITA for telling my sister she should have asked before using my dead cat’s litter box?,"Last week I had no choice but to euthanize my cat due to heart failure. I rushed him to the vet after I found him on the floor struggling to breathe only to be told any kind of treatment would basically still be a death sentence. He was only 5, and it came completely unexpected to me and was highly traumatic. It fucked me up so badly that I made myself sick and slept the rest of the day. My sister (I live with her in her house so she lived with my cat as well) went out and adopted a cat the SAME day, after she had learned about his death. I had no idea she had done this until the day after when she told me. I was shocked she brought a cat home not even a full 24 hours after mine had died.

Fast forward a few days and I realize she had taken my cat’s litter box (in the garage, not indoors) to use for the new cat without asking me. This may seem trivial because it’s just a litter box, but it was still mine that I purchased for my cat and I hadn’t planned on taking care of it until I could fully process he was gone. 

I explained to her why I was so shocked about all of this and why she didn’t at least ask me first, and she responded that I was being hurtful and venomous.

142,1ebm5xg,AITA for doing my nails somewhere else? ,"
My younger cousin (F20) started doing nails 3 years ago as a way to cope with the pandemic. 
I started getting my nails with her for some occasions like a friend's wedding or my birthday. The thing is that I always had to come back because they would always chip or break no matter what I did.

Last Christmas I got my nails with her and when filing them, she  did it a little too hard and I got blister on 3 of my fingers, she did some type of polygel and by 1 am in the morning they were all gone. When I sent her a picture of my bare hands she told me that maybe my nails were not meant for that kind of treatment 

Mind you, she would always charge me complete prices and most of the time I had to bring some of my own materials (nothing fancy, just like acetone or cotton balls), and on top of that she would take an obscene amount to time to finish my hands. We would sometime take 4-5 hours. I Know this things take time but not that much. 

A month ago my brother told me his friend had opened her own home studio, I had an upcoming trip and I decided to go to her. I had THE BEST MANICURE EVER, she was so detailed and precise, my bf was amazed and he decided to get his nails there too. I posted pictures and my cousin told me that I was not supportive of her or her business, I told her that with the trip I was not risking having broken of chipped nails and she told me she was still learning and I should support her because we are family. My aunt also jumped in the picture to tell my mom I should always choose family first and my mom just told them that I'm free to go wherever I want. 

She is still mad at me and everytime I post a picture of me and my nails are there she always comments or sends me a message saying ""okay just go to her then"", I told her she was being immature and took her off my socials.

143,1ebltot,AITA for booking my wedding first? ,"ATIA for booking my wedding before my cousin’s wedding? 

Background: I started dating my fiancé in late 2018. We got engaged in June 2024. 

My cousin Frank, and his girlfriend, Kim, started dating around the same time we did,  but still, after us. They got engaged August 2023. 

Kim and Frank booked their wedding in Dec 2023 for early Dec 2025, nearly 2 years in advance. 

I recently got engaged and have always dreamed of a fall wedding. My fiancé and I decided we did not want a particularly long engagement because his cousin is getting married in 2026 in a foreign country. 

Our dream venue had an opening for Nov. 1 2025. We jumped on it and are excited. 

However, my family (namely Kim and my aunt) is extremely upset. They can’t give me a clear reason why, other than we “disrespected them”. I think it’s because that our wedding is now before K and F’s and we haven’t been engaged as long. 

But it’s not my fault Kim and Frank had a 2 almost 3 year long engagement. I shouldn’t have to call and ask permission to book my own wedding? 

The guest lists only overlap by 8 people. No flights are needed.

144,1eblp7w,AITA for declining to go to a concert with my friend even though he got the tickets because he thought I would want to go?,"so, I (28 F) and my friend (26 M) occasionally go to concerts together because he gets free tickets on the regular and I'm an avid concert goer so I like having the opportunity to see live music for free. I will call him Max for the sake of this post. We just got back from a concert the week before this happened and I also am starting to unpack a few feelings considering this event.

A few weeks ago, Max told me that a particular band that I like was coming around to the venue we go to and he offered to get the free tickets. I told him that I didn't think I could go because I had made some tentative plans with my family. He got the tickets anyway.

I was kind of okay cool, whatever. Originally, I thought, maybe if my plans with my family fell through i might be able to go to the concert but it is what it is. I told him not to count on me and that he should try and find someone else to go with him. This is where I feel like maybe I AM the asshole because I talked to him about how my plans with my family were tentative so he knew that there was a chance I might be free that night. 

Now fast forward to this week. I finish my summer semester classes this week and am currently in the middle of finals and submitting homework assignments and studying for exams. I had strict deadlines to meet. He knew I was doing homework and essentially busy.

I was taking a short break and had decided I wanted to have a small celebratory girls’ night out after finals with some friends who are in town that i never really get to see and i texted him as much. the only nights that would work for me and my friends would be a Thursday night or the same night I had made plans with my family. (and is also the same night of the concert). 

At this point I texted Max and said that I would 100 % pass on the show hoping he had found someone else to go with since the show is still over a week away. I wanted to leave that night open for my family and if that fell through, I was going to try and do the girls night since most of my friends would likely be able to make it. 

he responded back by saying it was a ""kick in the nuts"" for him and that he ""would have loved to treat his favorite person to a nice trip and a show"". I started to feel guilty because he got the tickets because I like the band. 

maybe 40 minutes later he replies to my original text reiterating how it was a ""kick in the nuts"" and that he had no interest in seeing the band and equated my turning him down to ""a horse kicking backwards type s\*\*t."" He goes on to say ""I’ll get over it. I have no interest in the band but I started listening a bit just cause"". 

These words and a few others along the same lines have me kinda scratching my head but also feeling guilty and for what? wanting to see my other friends or my family?

I love her very much and I don't want to lose her, but I'm feeling like only I give up on things, and that only she can do things. Sorry for my English, I'm Brazilian.

149,1ebks81,WIBTA for telling my friend not to come to a concert? ,"So, my girlfriend and I had bought tickets to 4 different concerts over the past couple of months. Recently my friend has been talking to me about wanting to go to these concerts, and actually bought tickets to one of them. The thing is, he doesn't even listen to any of these artists and it feels a little out of the blue. It's frustrating because me and my girlfriend have been preparing for these concerts and have been looking forward to these for awhile. The last 3 concerts we have gone to it was with friends so these next ones were supposed to be special with just my girlfriend and I. He hasn't asked me if it was even okay if he went, i understand a concert is a pubic environment but he never asked me. Another thing is that he doesn't have a car, and most of these concerts are about an hour away from our city. I'm not sure what to do, and it's kinda hard to tell him that id rather have this just be between me and my girlfriend and I. Am I the asshole?

Edit: just to clarify, i’m fine with him coming to the one he already bought tickets to, it’s the ones that he hasnt bought tickets yet for that i’m wondering if i should say something about. and just to make it clear, he does want to go with me and i am his only way there.

151,1ebk0db,AITA for getting an unexpected Buzz Cut?,"This is admittedly silly and fairly low stakes…

I got my haircut today. I’m a middle aged man with thinning hair. Most of the time I get a fancy, over priced crew style cut. Short on the sides (#1 guard), scissor cut on top - also fairly short. When I wear a navy blue shirt I get mistaken for a cop, if that’s any indication. I’m not btw. 

Anyway, it’s summer, it’s hot, I sweat a lot and we’re about to go camping at the beach. My hair was too long for my liking and I wanted it cut before we went. I couldn’t find time to get with my normal guy, so I stopped somewhere else today and got a #1 buzz cut. It’s short, and my top looks kind of bare, but I don’t think it looks bad. I kind of dig it. I’ve wanted to buzz my head for years, but haven’t. 

My decision was not met kindly by my daughter (6) and my wife (eternally 39). When I picked my daughter up from camp this afternoon she had a full on meltdown. She was screaming on the floor “MY DADDY IS BALD!” The counselors came over to make sure she wasn’t hurt. I had to explain that I got a hair cut she didn’t like. It was ridiculous and kind of embarrassing. This isn’t the problem.

When I got home with my kids and my wife answered the door the look of disgust on her face when she saw me was staggering. 

She was really annoyed. We are going on vacation with her family in a couple of days - she said I should have thought about how we are going to see her family; that she has to look at me while it grows back in (this has been stated several times throughout the night); and that she doesn’t want to be in pictures with me looking the way I do; that I’ve known she doesn’t want to be with someone who is bald (for the record we’ve been together for 17 years, married for 10 with 3 kids - nobody’s going anywhere :) Like I said - low stakes) 

She also said she resented me being annoyed about my hair maintenance when it takes her so long to do hers - none of her routine is on me - it was there before me and will be there long after I am, statistically, dead. She’s got GREAT hair. 

These were all said mostly in a somewhat lighthearted (kinda sorta) manor, but I feel like that’s kind of hurtful? Yes? 

She’s barely looked at me. My daughter was cool after I let her have some fruit snacks and she likes how soft and fuzzy it is. 

My wife also said I should have known she’d be upset. And maybe a part of me did, but not to this degree. I mean I kind of knew I was going to do it and didn’t say anything other than I was going to get my haircut. So maybe I purposefully withheld that information. 

Anyway, am I the asshole here? My insides say probably not, but I’m also willing to accept that maybe I’m not seeing this clearly. 

Anyway - I get my haircut every 3 - 4 weeks so it’ll be a quick turn around, but it feels like I got caught draining the bank accounts to fuel my erotic Hummel figurine habit (this is a joke. It’s not a habit. I can stop whenever I like).

153,1ebjmxf,AITA for questioning my best friends loyalty to our friendship ,"So for some back story…I dated an abusive person for some years let’s call him J. J had a best friend T. After our breakup I was still friends with T who had a new gf I had known from high school let’s call her A. For reference this is how myself and A became best friends. 

A few short years later A and I were pregnant at the same time( she had married T)  we talked here and there over social media but weren’t at the best friend stage yet. After our little we’re about 3 we had begun a friendship that hasn’t stopped or slowed down at all. It’s now been about 4 years of constant contact kids birthday parties and a girls trip. We call each other soul sisters because we really get each other and haven’t found others who really do.

Fast forward to 10 months ago we did our first girls trip just the two of us she planned it for my birthday and we had a blast. After that she started to become distant and reply backs were few and far between. I was busy myself buying a house and moving and dealing with family issues. After everything settled I’ve invited her and her family numerous times to our house that is now only 15 mins away from their home (before we were 45 mins away) we moved in November and she still has yet to come see our home or even come by. Our conversations have dwindled for no apparent reason. 

A few weeks ago I was scrolling through social media and happened to see a post by J’s new gf C of them at the beach with A and T. Mind you they’ve been so completely busy they couldn’t make it to my new house to visit or meet my new puppy or let our littles play nothing. Barely any contact  

A hates J or so she tells me either because she truly does for what he had done to me or she’s telling me that to make me feel better. 

I confronted her about the situation feeling very hurt that she doesn’t have time for me but has time for someone very triggering in my life. 

Her response basically was gas lighting how much she loves me and our friendship and how J was going through family stuff and needed his friend T( they hadn’t really been close since the breakup between me and J. And I’ve been the one invited to the littles birthday parties not J) 

Naturally I forgave her thinking maybe she just has too much on her plate and it’s not her wanting to do that but her husbands want to see his friend. I let it go. 

It happened again. I have tried not to let it get under my skin but I can’t help it at this point. We call each others kids our nieces and nephews and now Js new gf is commenting on A’s social media how much she loves As littles who call me auntie. 

I’ve since found out they’ve hung out at least 2 more times since the first time and I have barely heard from my best friend and she still has not seen my house or anything. We’ve been moved in for 9 months now. I don’t know how to feel but I feel like maybe the friendship has run its course and I just need to accept that and move on because she’s clearly trying to ghost me or just hopes I’ll go away.

156,1ebims2,AITAH for smoking instead of spending time with my sister?,"So for context, I (19F) have really bad anxiety, adhd, and I’m an introvert. Often times when I go out in public I only stay out for a few hours as I tend to get overstimulated very easily and that drains my social battery a lot faster. One of the ways I cope with this is by smoking weed as it calms me down and helps regulate some overwhelming emotions

So my sister (18F) is going to college very soon and yesterday she wanted to spend some time together before we both left. We wanted to go shopping but each wanted to go to different stores. I got ready and everything and we went to my store first. After spending maybe an hour in there, my mom called us to come bring her mustard and parsley as she was at a cooking event. We ended up going home for the mustard and then to the store to buy parsley because we had none before going to her. By this time it’s been around 45 mins by the time we get to my mom. When my sister drives she plays music super loud which is fine, but gets overwhelming after a while. When we get to my mom all the girls there wanna stay and chat so by that time we’ve been out over 2 hours. 

We still had to go to my sisters store, but when she shops she takes around an hour to 90 mins and she wanted to go to 2 stores. I knew I would not want to go as my social battery was pretty low and I knew I would just become a bitch if I was out for another 2+ hours. I told her I would still go I just probably wouldn’t talk a lot and be very quiet, and she said that she doesn’t if I’m “gonna be boring and pout the whole time” so she drove me home. I told her that I would be more talkative if I could have an hour to myself to recharge, and I’d gladly go out with her after but she was mad at me. She told me ‘you’re not socializing with anyone though so what’s the deal’ and I told her that I’d be socializing with her, to which she said that she doesn’t count and my ‘rules’ don’t apply to her because she’s my sister. I still told her I’ll go out later if she wanted and she said she didn’t care

Later on she ended up going to the gym and getting food by herself, and I was home alone so I smoked a bowl outside my house. She came back 2 hours later, saying the entire house reeked like weed and that she seriously couldn’t believe that I’d smoke any chance I got. She told me I’m an addict and everyone in the house knows when I smoke because everyone can smell it, they just don’t say anything because they’ve ’given up’. She says that I would rather stay home and get high than go shopping with her even though she’s leaving for college soon. AITAH?

",Asshole,2024-07-25,"AITAH for smoking instead of spending time with my sister? So for context, I (19F) have really bad anxiety, adhd, and I’m an introvert. Often times when I go out in public I only stay out for a few hours as I tend to get overstimulated very easily and that drains my social battery a lot faster. One of the ways I cope with this is by smoking weed as it calms me down and helps regulate some overwhelming emotions

So my sister (18F) is going to college very soon and yesterday she wanted to spend some time together before we both left. We wanted to go shopping but each wanted to go to different stores. I got ready and everything and we went to my store first. After spending maybe an hour in there, my mom called us to come bring her mustard and parsley as she was at a cooking event. We ended up going home for the mustard and then to the store to buy parsley because we had none before going to her. By this time it’s been around 45 mins by the time we get to my mom. When my sister drives she plays music super loud which is fine, but gets overwhelming after a while. When we get to my mom all the girls there wanna stay and chat so by that time we’ve been out over 2 hours. 

We still had to go to my sisters store, but when she shops she takes around an hour to 90 mins and she wanted to go to 2 stores. I knew I would not want to go as my social battery was pretty low and I knew I would just become a bitch if I was out for another 2+ hours. I told her I would still go I just probably wouldn’t talk a lot and be very quiet, and she said that she doesn’t if I’m “gonna be boring and pout the whole time” so she drove me home. I told her that I would be more talkative if I could have an hour to myself to recharge, and I’d gladly go out with her after but she was mad at me. She told me ‘you’re not socializing with anyone though so what’s the deal’ and I told her that I’d be socializing with her, to which she said that she doesn’t count and my ‘rules’ don’t apply to her because she’s my sister. I still told her I’ll go out later if she wanted and she said she didn’t care

Later on she ended up going to the gym and getting food by herself, and I was home alone so I smoked a bowl outside my house. She came back 2 hours later, saying the entire house reeked like weed and that she seriously couldn’t believe that I’d smoke any chance I got.

157,1ebi77k,AITA for stealing a pack of sanitary pads from my sister,"A few weeks ago I bought 2 packs of sanitary pads from a grocery store and used 1 pad. A few days ago my older sister didn't have any pads so I brought the pack that had been on my dresser downstairs to the family bathroom so that she could share them with me. Today my sister was at work and texted my brother that she was having an emergency and needed him to deliver a pad to her place of work. He was busy so I was going to do it. The pack of pads in the family bathroom was empty as she had used all of them so I didn't think we had any more pads in the house as I had checked all of the bathrooms and only found tampons which she doesn't like to use. I asked her if bringing her tampons would be okay and she said no because she's scared of them. I asked her if she could send me money to go out and buy her some pads and bring them to her place of work, she told me to ask our dad for money. I did this and went to our nearest grocery store and bought a pack of pads and on the way back she said she no longer wanted me to deliver them to her place of work and to instead just put them in the family bathroom so that she has them when she gets home. I did this. Later in the day I was unpacking an overnight bag I'd recently used to do laundry and found that I had the pack of pads (that was full except for one pad) that I had forgotten I'd had. I swapped this pack with the unopened pack in the family bathroom as I wanted a full pack for myself. The 3 packs were the same kind of pad with the same amount but were from different supermarket brands. When my sister got home she noticed that the brand didn't line up with the store I'd bought the new pads from and was very mad at me for ""stealing from the family"".

Why I may be the A: The pads I stole were the ones bought with my dad's money so I technically did steal from the family.

Why I don't think I'm the A: The pads I bought with my dad's money cost the same amount as each pack I gave my sister so I spent twice the amount that I stole and I didn't think it would be a big deal I just wanted a whole pack for myself since she had previously used the whole first pack and the one I swapped the new pack out with was pretty much whole just minus 1 pad. I also think I was kind to her for having spent my own money on the first pack I gave her which she used and for having gone out to buy another pack and I would have delivered the pack bought with my dad's money to her if she hadn't changed her mind. I don't think me swapping the packs negates the fact that I was nice to her.

Please let me know if I am the A because I honestly don't think so but she was very angry at me and saying a lot of not nice stuff and it made me feel really guilty.

158,1ebhx6i,AITA - moved home and asked dad to do one chore,"

After family dissolution, my dad was living alone in a fairly big house. He was down due to everyone moving out and let the place rot. He kept his room and bathroom, but otherwise let the cats overtake the house and never cleaned the kitchen but dishes. 

 I got done with college and realized, I cant reasonably afford to live alone. I had the opportunity to have a place to go rent-free and cleaned up the home with the help of other family and began to take on regular cleaning. 

 My dad was enthusiastic about me living there; the work that had been done, etc. He initially helped with pets, and agreed to clean up after the cats. He does dishes as well.  

It then became apparent that he wasn’t doing what he agreed. He stopped cleaning up after cats and only scooped litter every few days. I asked him to kindly to continue that and to make sure he is checking for throw-up / hairballs each day and he agreed to do it. He doesn’t do this. I noticed a hairball and I didn’t say anything (which I normally would) A few days went by and he had not been doing what it. I asked him if he could take care of it and he lied to me by saying he hadn’t checked “for that day” and that he’d do it later. (Didn’t)  He was, it seemed, hoping other animals would “clean it up”. 

 I brought it up to him that he doesn’t really do his fair share at all and I really needed him to take responsibility for, at the very minimum, that small portion of what needs to be done. He sat at the dinner table eating his food and  pretended he didn’t hear me. I have now been given me the silent treatment for days.

 To put it into perspective, every single day (to keep up with the level of dirtiness from multiple dogs and cats) I dust, sweep/vacuum the kitchen, living room, and foyer, deep clean at least one room in the house, and wipe down the kitchen surfaces. He has no job, is in fine physical health,and literally spends 3+ hours LITERALLY just lying in bed. 

The only thing I could think from his perspective Is that maybe I have encroached too much on his personal space and should never have thought it was a good idea to return in the first place. As much as he initially seemed enthusiastic, he now acts as though I am a nuisance, like a bug or something , in his home.

 From my perspective, having a home (it was gifted to him by the way and for which he pays $0 ever for bills or anything) brings inherent responsibilities, whether someone else lives there or not. I can’t win because if I do all of the work to have a clean home, I am using all of my free time and energy and essentially become like a maid for him, and if I just let the house rot, I have to live in a disgusting,  unsanitary environment outside of my personal spaces.

159,1ebhwkx,AITA for ignoring my boyfriend and his mother?,"AITA-

32F here...

Two days ago my 39m boyfriend complained that I did not contribute to the bills enough ( Only because i have to get the baby stuff and milk and food and everything we need out of my money i make, while his goes to bills.) and did not work as much as him. Even though I work, I still come home and clean and take care of our kid. While all he does is work, come home, play video games, and plays with are son. 

So yesterday I asked him to bring me a soda pop from the store after work and he forgot, so he sent five dollars to me even though I told him not to that I would get one at the end of my shift if I made the money.

Today was a bad day at work and I only ended up making 35.50.....so I messaged him and told him how much I made and what he wanted me to get, he said just gas and cigarettes. ( I asked him because of the previous convo we had about how he feels I don't contribute to the bills.) So I put the $5 with what I made got gas and cigarettes out of it and only had $13 left, so I decided not to get my soda pop.

 I'm already irritated because I have not eaten and once agian can't get my favorite soda because money is tight and he wants me to start paying more of the bills. I come home and I'm pretty upset and he tries to get me to tell him what's wrong I tell him I don't want to talk about it and to leave me alone. 

He keeps pressuring me to tell him so finally I snap and say "" I'm hungry and want a soda pop!"" 

He gets mad and starts yelling at me that I should have eaten before work and that he gave me the money for the sodas.

I tell him that he is always complaining about me not giving money for bills that I decided to not get the sodas because I only had 13 bucks left and that I sent it to him to try to help with bills like he had previously said he wanted me to do. (Even though this time it was only 13 bucks most of the time after gas cigarettes and sodas along with food and baby stuff I'm left with very little anyway around $30 or $40)

He goes on to yell at me that ""It's my fault I'm unhappy because I just did not get the things I wanted, and that all my unhappiness in my life was because of me and my actions and decisions""

I told him "" okay cool"" and have been completely ignoring him. 

As well as his mother who after the fight and after he left for work I over heard talking on the phone defending him and saying that I keep her son out all night working ( he only works from 430 to 10 pm) 
Not that I blame her a mother will always defend her kids and I'm not one of them it still hurt my feelings because she knows he never cleans or does what he says he will do because we stay in her house and help her pay her bills so she can keep her house 

So am I the asshole for ignoring them completely and just focusing on my son and TV?

I know he's grieving,  but I tell him he shouldn't be driving and I felt uncomfortable him inviting me to tag along with them?? 
I said as much,  he got very upset and defensive (again,  he's drunk) and told me I was massing it a bigger deal than it was.  He got very flustered and left yelling out the window that I need to meet up with them. 

I don't want to. I have too much to do,  that he often interrupts but I kind of want to make sure he's OK.

There was a time that my aunt approached me and mentioned that one of my younger sister's kept passing by suspiciously everytime there are a group of adults conversing. She explained that she suspects my sister was eavesdropping and whatever info she picks up she reports to her Mother; which is my stepmom. Who works abroad. I fully thought that my aunt was overthinking it as she had just moved in after a divorce and she had a hard time because my stepmom prevented her from getting an area of the house for herself so there's some hate going on between the two of them. 

Yet, one night while I was cleaning the kitchen sink I noticed another aunt of mine call my youngest sibling, she was the baby of the fam. They invited her to their room to talk about how much they'd pay for her once they take her to a buffet since someone's birthday was coming up. After a while I kept hearing someone's footsteps going up and down the stairs a lot and when I glanced behind my back it was that sister of mine who suspectedly likes to eavesdrop on people. I payed it no mind but around the 4th or 5th time she passed by behind my back I started getting suspicious of her actions and secretly started monitoring what she was doing. I may have confirmed my aunt's suspiciouns as I witness my sister go inside the bathroom, pretend to wash her hands and stare at her nails for more than 5 minutes. She then proceeded to turn the water on and when it was almost full she turned it off and got out. Next thing she was hanging around near the door to my aunt's room, casually pretending like she was picking up any mess she finds. Not suspicious enough? She doesn't even clean!. So by the 7th time that I caught her passing by me I raised my voice a little and asked ""what are you doing over there?"" She flinched, told me she wasn't doing anything and ran off. Apparently my voice was loud enough for my dad to hear so we spent a good amount of time arguing why I raised my voice at my younger sister.

164,1ebhjgz,AITA: Husband doesn’t stick up for me with the kids,"I’m the primary disciplinarian. I have two sons 13&16. We live in a very urban area. My husband lets them get away with too much because “boys will be boys”.. the question is… they outright disrespect me to my face when my husband (their bio father) is present. Saying things like “when you get old we will take care of you, not mom” they say all sorts of things that are of equal weight. “If someone said something bad about you we wouldn’t stick up for you. Probably dad but not you” I brought it to his attention, he says “I ignore it because I don’t want to give it any credence” yet I’m always the bad guy. He says it is important to him that he is their friend. I think the exact opposite. Who’s the asshole? (Tried to keep it short and simple.)

Edit: we are both bio parents married 17 yrs. And yes I do activities with them like hiking, beach, going to the mall, pool etc. 
Discipline for skipping school, talking back to teachers, refusing to do chores, staying up til 4am playing video games, arguing with me when I’ve made a decision (I.e. no video games during school week) 
He has RARELY is left home with the kids. He often leaves as he was army, now he is heavily involved with the VFW (veterans of foreign wars) which is a lot of time away from family. 
I haven’t cooked or done laundry for a few years now. Feel walked all over, cooking for kids who are ungrateful, being the only parent actively parenting and working. He does the cooking now. I was a SAHM til they entered school. Breastfed, homemade baby food, kept house clean, cooked every day, went on trips to parks, zoos etc regularly. ( I also am the one who exercises the dogs, take them to parks ponds etc)   
I can’t “give up” they’re my kids, and if I did they would fail school, be on video games 24/7 and speak to adults however the hell they want to, break stuff in the house (excessive rough housing)

165,1ebhic6,WIBTAH if I uninvite my sister from family vacation?,"Context: My father (68 M) was diagnosed with late stage frontotemporal dementia 2 years ago. He can’t do anything independently (eat, bathroom, shower, etc.) and needs continuous supervision. Last Monday, my mother (64 F) who is the primary care provider for him underwent right hip replacement surgery and is in the recovery process. My sister (31 F) is currently unemployed, does not drive, has lived with my parents her entire life, and has yet to take on any care taking responsibilities for my mother or father. I am primarily responsible for taking my mother to appointments, grocery shopping, etc. I live 30 minutes (1 way) from my parents house.

I (25 F) moved out when I went to college and have lived with my fiancé (26 M) for 6 years. We are going on family vacation with his side of the family next week for 4 days. It is a small beach vacation 3 hours away from home. Any vacations are open invitations, which normally includes me and my sister along with his side of the family. This time was no different, so when my fiancés mother booked the trip in May it was implied that she would be coming as well. The following month in June, I found out my mother scheduled a hip replacement surgery two weeks before the trip. This was not an issue as we expected her to be recovered enough to care for herself and my dad. However, recovery is taking longer than expected and she is not able to do most tasks independently as of today. The vacation is 4 days away.
My sister is very excited for the trip and hasn’t volunteered to stay back to care for my mom and dad nor do I believe she intends to. I do not want to leave my mom and dad alone with no support.
I think I will be the asshole If I ask her to stay back to care for them instead of doing it myself. Rescheduling is not a possibility as I was not the person responsible for booking.
