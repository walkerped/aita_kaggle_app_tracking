0,1ecaivb,AITA for not letting my roommates cat come out of their bedroom? ,"So I (23F) and my girlfriend (22F) live together with our roommates. Them being (23F) and (22F). Recently a lot has happened between my girlfriend and I and the roommates.

Also my girlfriend and the roommate go way back into high school. Everything was fine with them. My cat (3F) has anxiety and behavior issues.

I really enjoy the freedom and alone time at my mom's, after school I come home chill, nap, read webtoon, and draw. I don't have to deal with people, lectures, or toddlers. I really like being that way, my mom leaves me alone, we rarely talk, and I get to eat what I like, when I like. My Nana is usually busy so I am home alone except for my nana's MIL (78f).

I just really want freedom and no responsibility. At my dad's, I have a bedtime and have to get up when his family does. They try to get me to do family things and my little sister's are always in my business. My dad and step-mom have rules on diet and try to track my water intake and vitamins and won't let me eat like I do at my nana's.

My gf comes from an abusive/neglectful home and she spends 90% of her time at my house instead of at her moms house. My parents let her stay because they know I love her a lot and they also know she doesn't have a great home situation.

But because of this she is pretty close to my sister, who took a year break before going to college.

We're all pretty close. But my sister came home and said she feels uncomfortable being around my gf and she doesn't want her to come to our house anymore. My parents and I asked why and she said she caught her stealing food (and this isn't the first time) and it makes her really uncomfortable. She basically said stealing is bad and she doesn't want to be involved with stealing.

It turned into a whole argument. I said she's a CHILD, she doesn't control the money she has and my sister wants to blame her for stealing food when her family doesn't have money? 

My sister said she could have asked for the money, but my gf is super prideful. She once use to wait outside high school for hours for her mom to pick her up because she was too embarrassed to ask us for a ride. She does not like accepting help.

6,1ed22s6,AITA for wanting the bigger bedroom?,"Almost every year my parents take their family (my family + my brother's family) on vacation. We have rented the same place for several years. The place has one bedroom & bathroom downstairs. It also has three bedrooms upstairs. One bedroom is the master with a king bed, private bath, sitting area and balcony. Another bedroom is pretty big with a king bed. The final bedroom has two twin beds. Both of those bedrooms share a bathroom.

When we started staying there, my parents took the master. My family took the two bedrooms upstairs and my brother (no kids yet) took the bedroom downstairs because he didn't want to share a bathroom with anyone. I don't think my SIL loved the arrangement. I offered to use that bedroom, but they would need to share a bathroom upstairs.

After my brother and his wife had a child, they moved into the master. My parents moved downstairs. The steps were becoming too much for them, anyways. 

The last time we went, my daughter slept on a mattress on the floor in the larger king room (where I was). My brother's family had the other two rooms. My SIL & child in the master and my brother in the twin room. Unfortunately, my mom passed away last summer, and we didn't go so it's been a couple of years.

My dad wants to keep the downstairs bedroom and none of us have an issue with that. Now my daughter is now almost a teenager. My brother and his wife have a second child.

I didn't want to ask my daughter to sleep on the floor again. She could try sharing the big bed but we move around a lot in our sleep (and snore) so I don't think we would get much sleep that way. 

I proposed that my daughter and the oldest cousin share the twin room. However, his parents don't feel he is ready to sleep in a room without one of them so my brother and his son will be sharing the twin room. 

The other option I came up with was that my family could take the master. That way we could try sharing the bed and if that doesn't work, we would have the couch as an option. We would also have more space for privacy (my daughter is a lot older than her cousins). My brother's family would have the beds they need in the other room and only have to share a bathroom with each other.

When I proposed this solution, my SIL said she assumed she would get the master again and that my daughter would sleep on an air mattress (I don't have an air mattress but when I pointed that out, she offered to bring one.) We can't even move the actual mattress over we did last time from the twin room because both of those will be used.

My SIL's main reason for wanting the master is that it has a bathtub, and the other bathroom does not. I totally get that because the boys are so young - but I feel like not asking my daughter to sleep on the floor is more important. We used that bathroom when my daughter was younger.

8,1ed1hyk,AITA for refusing to clean up after my partners family dogs?,"So I (M18) had to move in with my partners (F17) house with her family about 8 or so months ago because of family troubles of my own. Bernadette's (fake name) mother and I sat down went over the conditions of me moving in, I handle my own messes and so on so forth (plus a few extra rules that were sprung onto me afterwards but yk). 

I obviously follow the set rules and go beyond because I appreciate them letting me stay here, but prior to me moving in they had two dogs, 1 puppy and 1 older dog. Now I'd like to say, I am the worst with bad smells, put me in a room with just a mildly bad fart and I will be sweating and grasping onto my soul as it leaves my wimpy body. HOWEVER, the puppy created a lot of mess (poop) in his first 7 or so months of being with the family and I unfortunately had to clean up a good portion of the death that had been expelled from the growing beast. 

About a month ago they brought home another one... Cutest thing alive but instead of Sharknado it's SHITnado with this thing, on top of cleaning up after really everyone else's mess on most days (not in the list of rules agreed on btw) me and Bernadette's little sister are unfairly made to clean up the shit almost everytime.

Reddit, I am struggling so much rn, and this literal shit mixed with life is so hard to handle. I just wanted to know if I'm in the wrong for feeling like this?

To add more context. I put a good chunk of my income into rent, I refused to live here without paying rent, it was also Bernadette's parents who offered the opportunity to me, I did accept but that was under different terms that I accepted.

I'm not at all disrespectful, I take everything that is asked of me to do with a spoon of bloody honey and do it immediately. I like to help but it gets hard when I'm also and individual person living through all my own bullsh*t.
",No A-holes here,2024-07-26,"AITA for refusing to clean up after my partners family dogs? So I (M18) had to move in with my partners (F17) house with her family about 8 or so months ago because of family troubles of my own. Bernadette's (fake name) mother and I sat down went over the conditions of me moving in, I handle my own messes and so on so forth (plus a few extra rules that were sprung onto me afterwards but yk). 

I obviously follow the set rules and go beyond because I appreciate them letting me stay here, but prior to me moving in they had two dogs, 1 puppy and 1 older dog. Now I'd like to say, I am the worst with bad smells, put me in a room with just a mildly bad fart and I will be sweating and grasping onto my soul as it leaves my wimpy body. HOWEVER, the puppy created a lot of mess (poop) in his first 7 or so months of being with the family and I unfortunately had to clean up a good portion of the death that had been expelled from the growing beast. 

About a month ago they brought home another one... Cutest thing alive but instead of Sharknado it's SHITnado with this thing, on top of cleaning up after really everyone else's mess on most days (not in the list of rules agreed on btw) me and Bernadette's little sister are unfairly made to clean up the shit almost everytime.

Reddit, I am struggling so much rn, and this literal shit mixed with life is so hard to handle. I just wanted to know if I'm in the wrong for feeling like this?

9,1ed19i9,AITA for not taking one of our friends on a graduation trip to Europe?,"I (17F) am going to be a senior this year. I have been part of a close friend group of myself and five other girls since our freshman year. Another girl, Sarah, sort of joined our group at the beginning of this year. She hangs out with us at school, but not much outside of school. We do invite her to stuff, but her mom is kinda strict and doesn‚Äôt always let her go. It sucks but there‚Äôs nothing any of us can do about it. We haven‚Äôt had the chance to get super close to her as a result. 

We‚Äôre planning a trip to Europe for two months next summer after we graduate. We were planning to include Sarah since she‚Äôs going to be an adult by then and her mom can‚Äôt stop her, but we‚Äôve been having some issues. Her mom doesn‚Äôt want her to go, so she‚Äôs not giving her any money, so her budget is much lower than the rest of us. We would have to either cut costs somehow or pay for part of Sarah‚Äôs costs. We‚Äôve been planning this trip since our freshman year and Sarah‚Äôs budget doesn‚Äôt fit our plan. She‚Äôs also not really fit enough to do everything we want to do, like walking tours and hiking. 

We‚Äôve tried to work out a solution, but nothing really works. Sarah suggested going somewhere cheaper like Latin America or Southeast Asia but we don‚Äôt want to change our years old plan for her. We offered to cover her accommodations, but there‚Äôs really not much we can do for her since we don‚Äôt have unlimited budgets either. We offered some other solutions to make the trip cheaper, but she honestly just doesn‚Äôt fit into the plans we‚Äôve had for years. She wants a vacation, we want to travel. The things she wants to do don‚Äôt fit any of our budgets. She mainly wants to go to super touristy places like in Italy and Greece and relax while we want to see as much as we can at a much faster pace. 

Eventually, we told her that her budget and plans don‚Äôt really fit with ours and we would be going without her. This was last week and she‚Äôs been completely silent in the group chat and didn‚Äôt come hang out with us at all since then until today. We were at my house this morning and she said she feels left out. She feels like we never fully accepted her because she wasn‚Äôt able to hang out with us as much because of her mom and now we‚Äôre leaving her out of this trip because of her financial situation. 

She started crying and said that she‚Äôs never had a close knit friend group and thought this might be her chance to have one but we never accepted her. That‚Äôs not true at all. We tried to accept her and we include her in everything. It‚Äôs not our fault that she can‚Äôt come hang out with us most of the time or that she can‚Äôt afford to go on this trip. She left first and hasn‚Äôt said anything despite all of us texting her both in the group chat and privately.

It got to the point where it honestly seemed like Jane was just doing these things to have a reason to complain, so I eventually stopped giving her advice but would still let her vent

Recently, Jane switched jobs after years of complaining about her old one and how she felt underpaid and under appreciated, which I do agree that she was. So I helped her get a new job at my old place of employment with a significantly better salary. My old boss had left but I was still in touch with one of my old coworkers, Sarah, who told me to let Jane know that the new boss will sometimes call employees after hours, but they are in no way legally obligated to answer and wouldn't be penalized for not taking a call. Sarah said that neither she nor any of the other coworkers have ever answered a single call and to tell Jane to do the same so he doesn't keep bothering her. I explained this to Jane before she got the job and asked if she was sure she wanted to take it knowing that the boss might try to call her after clocking out but that she in no way was responsible for picking up. She said she understood and still wanted the job, so I set up an interview for her and she ended up getting it

A month in, Jane started complaining to me that the boss keeps calling her requesting things during off work hours. I told her that both Sarah and I had warned her not to pick up so that she wouldn't keep being bothered by him and asked why she picked up anyway. She scoffed and said ""Because I'm a good employee, so why wouldn't I pick up?"" then continued to complain about how annoying it was to work at a place where people condoned that and how she should have just stayed at her old job

This is where I may have been the asshole. I got very upset at that comment because I worked hard to secure an interview for her, so I said ""Actually, the only person condoning that is you. You knew before taking this job that the boss might try that and you were warned to just ignore it but chose not to, and now you're complaining about something you don't actually have to do. You always act helpless and like all these situations just unfairly happen to you, but you're actually causing most of your misery yourself and I can't help you anymore""

I ended up going home while Jane texted me saying she couldn't believe my lack of empathy and abandonment when I knew she had had a rough life. I told her she knew that I also had a very hard life but I am now an adult who takes responsibility for my problems and that she should do the same.

15,1ed03jp,AITA for explaining something to my gf in ‚Äúmakeup terms‚Äù,"I 20 F and my gf 19 F were having dinner with her family last week. For context, she has 5 siblings and her grandparents were there so there were 11 of us in total. My gf and I are also both neurodivergent (I have adhd and she has autism) so sometimes when we‚Äôre trying to explain things to each other we‚Äôll have to say it multiple times because something got lost in translation. 

We were sitting at the table at her house and there were several conversations going on around the table. One of her brothers (15 M) and I play the same video game (Valorant) and were talking about our experiences. My gf was listening to us and asked me to explain a situation I was telling her brother about. I tried to explain it but I could tell it wasn‚Äôt clicking. The only video game she plays is Stardew Valley which I have never played so I wasn‚Äôt able to think of a comparison that would make sense to that. My gf loves to do her makeup and is super good at it. I watch her do it all the time so I figured I could find a comparison with makeup. 

I told her the equivalent would be like having to do your eyeliner and get it really straight and clean and instead deciding to take some lipstick and just kinda doodle on your face. Her mom overheard our conversation and asked what we were talking about so I told her we were talking about a video game and that my gf wouldn‚Äôt get it so I was explaining it in makeup terms. Her mom and one of her sisters got really mad and started yelling at both me and my gf‚Äôs brother saying that we were sexist and disrespectful and treating my gf like she was too stupid to understand what we were talking about. 

I realize looking back that saying we were explaining things in ‚Äúmakeup terms‚Äù may not have been the best way to phrase it but I‚Äôm honestly not sure how I could phrase it any other way. 

My gf has assured me that she‚Äôs not mad and that it was actually a perfect way to explain it and that she understood what I meant but her mom and a few of her siblings are still really mad with me. Usually we have dinner with them on Sundays because they have a family dinner but I‚Äôve been uninvited until I apologize to her mom which feels weird and dumb to me. It had nothing to do with her and I have no idea what nerve I struck with her. 

My gf refuses to go to the dinners without me because her family stresses her out which is part of why we live together so early in the relationship (we‚Äôve dated for almost a year) I don‚Äôt want my gf to miss out on family time because of me even if she didn‚Äôt want to go in the first place but I truly don‚Äôt think I should have to apologize to her mother for explaining something to my gf.

Her mom overheard our conversation and asked what we were talking about so I told her we were talking about a video game and that my gf wouldn‚Äôt get it so I was explaining it in makeup terms. Her mom and one of her sisters got really mad and started yelling at both me and my gf‚Äôs brother saying that we were sexist and disrespectful and treating my gf like she was too stupid to understand what we were talking about. 

I realize looking back that saying we were explaining things in ‚Äúmakeup terms‚Äù may not have been the best way to phrase it but I‚Äôm honestly not sure how I could phrase it any other way. 

My gf has assured me that she‚Äôs not mad and that it was actually a perfect way to explain it and that she understood what I meant but her mom and a few of her siblings are still really mad with me. Usually we have dinner with them on Sundays because they have a family dinner but I‚Äôve been uninvited until I apologize to her mom which feels weird and dumb to me. It had nothing to do with her and I have no idea what nerve I struck with her. 

My gf refuses to go to the dinners without me because her family stresses her out which is part of why we live together so early in the relationship (we‚Äôve dated for almost a year) I don‚Äôt want my gf to miss out on family time because of me even if she didn‚Äôt want to go in the first place but I truly don‚Äôt think I should have to apologize to her mother for explaining something to my gf.

On our first date I got so nervous I told him all the disorders and disabilities I have, yet he stayed, so I was happy. But recently we get into fights regarding my well being.
The main reason are my Tourettes, neurodivergency and suspected OSDD-1b.

I do not only see, but he often tells me that my tics or my stims annoy him. And he even fights with me over them.

I'm also gonna get tested for said OSDD, and he doesn't understand why I would want that. 
I just want to exact reasons and want to get better, or at least not get worse....

18,1eczrg4,AITA  for not having enough toys for all the kids?,"Well, not toys, b8g toys.

So alittle context. My(33f) family (hubs 34m, Oldest son 12m, younger son 3m) was lucky enough to buy our dream house out in the country. Over the past 2 years, I have been building my dream yard. I'm talking a rc track, trampoline, swimming pool, tree house, play houses, bikes, little tykes outdoor toys..  you get the point. We have went all out with things outside to keep the kids off of screens as much as possible. Our latest addition is 2 powerwheels, a metal, go cart style one with 2 seats and a jeep with 2 seats. 

A year ago, we had a family move in across the street, our ONLY neighbors for miles. They are a small family of 4 (Tara 26f, Josh .27m, 5f, 3f) who we have become very close with. Unfortunately, they are not quite as fortunate as us so they are welcome over to play anytime, weather we are home 
or not. 

NOW. This past weekend, Tara's sister, Emily(30f) and her kids(9m, 7m, 5m, 3f) were down and spent some time at our house so all the kids could play. You'd think we have more than enough for all of them, but apparently not. Things were great for the first few hours. The kids mostly swam or played on the trampoline, but 9, 7 and 5 went in our garage and saw the powerwheels. I pulled them out and we were taking turns but 9 was throwing a fit when it wasn't his turn. The only one allowed to drive the big one was 12.

This caused a fight between Emily and I. She demanded 12 let someone else have a turn. I told her no because it was not meant for younger kids. She then switched to asking why I would have them. I told her I bought them for MY kids. She then started yelling about I shouldn't buy things like that if I don't buy enough for all the kids. Tara ended up dragging her back home.

19,1eczd1q,AITA For calling out a creep recording me and my friends,"So for context, I went to visit my two friends at their city for drinks & a movie. They're a couple and I've known them for four years now, and I've always enjoyed their company. I have really bad trust issues, but over time I was able to open up and allow it back into my life, until yesterday. 

So we were sitting at the table in the bar, chatting and ordering our drinks. When this guy and his (I presume) Girlfriend sit on the table next to us. I'm facing them, with one of my friends opposite and the other next to me. I don't take any notice of anything, until I see that he has his phone aimed at us. I assume he's taking a picture of his partner or whatever and try to ignore it. 

Then I see that his partner is ducking down and against the wall so his phone has got a clear view of us. I was so shocked. I really REALLY try to ignore this and hope that I've got the wrong perception of it. I decide to look at him for several seconds, to which he suddenly tilts the phone down and starts looking aimlessly around trying to act as if he wasn't!

So this 100% confirmed that he was recording us. The reason was unclear, maybe we looked ""different"" and obviously that needs to be chastised and humiliated? Was it turning him on? I wish I knew why the pr*ck was doing it. 

So I'm not one for confrontation of any kind, but in this scenario I spoke up. I thought to myself 'why should we have to move because of someone else's inappropriate actions'. So I look at the guy and ask him politely to stop recording us. 

This is when things took a HUGE turn, when both my friends look at me like a crazy person! They start calling me crazy and that I'm seeing things! The guy starts freaking out, he's getting extremely defensive and keeps reiterating that he wasn't doing anything. But at this point, I'm not focused on him, I'm focused on my so called friends who decide to take the side of some random creep who was recording us. 

I felt so angry and upset I walked out. I'm currently refusing to talk to them. I feel so let down and heartbroken. I put my trust in people again just to find out they don't have a single bit of trust in me. I also never stand up for myself, so what felt like a moment of strength turned into betrayal and humiliation. I just needed to vent this out, and someone to tell me I'm not wrong for what I did.

 My dog does not take well to fireworks or loud ""bangs"" of any kind, she gets super anxious and is on the edge whenever she hears a loud bang. Every fourth of July I like to take extra care of her, to make sure she's doing alright. I don't get mad at the fireworks on the fourth of July because its to be expected, its a holiday with fireworks and such. But this year, my neighbors have dragged out the fireworks, to the point my dog has made holes around the yard for herself to hide in. I've let her inside on various nights because she has become so scared to the point she tries to breakdown the door. 

With all of that into account, I have come to the point I want to tell my neighbors to fuck off with the fireworks. It's about to be august! Fourth of July was ages ago. But I keep deciding not to go to my neighbors and voice my anger. Im afraid its not my place to tell them what to do. 

Thinking about it from my neighbors perspective, they're just enjoying the fireworks without knowing the effects it has to everyone else in the neighborhood. They haven't been bad neighbors to me, aside from this instance.

I adore his mother and despite being in a bit of a financial conflict I agreed, as he said it was for a concert ticket and that him, his brother and father were all contributing so I assumed it wouldnt be so much if split between four people. 

He proceeded to tell me it was going to be around 35‚Ç¨ and I stated how that was quite expensive for one concert ticket split between four people. As I was surprised about that I asked how much the ticket would cost. He told me it was going to be 70‚Ç¨, which of course then it made no sense to pay 35‚Ç¨ if it was split between us four. 

He then informed me that it was for 2 tickets. One for his mother and one for his father. 

Now I should mention that his family is quite well off, they are financially stable and afford many luxuries. I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre almost upper middle class.

Of course I dont mind contributing to a gift if its someones birthday, but honestly speaking I am not willing to pay for a second participant, especially if that other person can easily afford that themself. 

I told him as such and that I thought the way he phrased and explained it all that I was misconceived into what I was supposed to contribute to. 

He then started being incredibly rude and saying how it was obvious his dad would be joining his mom at the concert. That I should ‚Äòjust pay 15 and he‚Äôll do 55 cause its for his mother‚Äô acting as if I hadnt been willing to pay. 

I wanna state that I will gladly pay for her gift but I am unwilling to pay for someone who the gift isnt for and who will just be accompanying. 

I would also like to make it clear that I am in a paid apprenticeship and a student. My salary isnt enough to sustain myself so I receive help. 

Me and my boyfriend are on top of that long distance and are planning to see each other next month which already has me spend a lot on train cost + his country has a higher cost of living. 

WIBTA for refusing to participate in paying for his dads ticket? 

Feel free to ask question in case I forgot any details or something seems unclear! 

I could really use some insight and second opinions on this.

24,1ecz53f,WIBTA if I told a coworker how she chose to display a gift on her desk upset me?,"I (32F) work in a fairly small office setting with a total of 8 office employees. Because we work so closely together, we typically get everyone something small for holidays and birthdays.

Last Christmas, I got everyone personalized Funko Pops. For those unfamiliar, they are small figurines of pop culture figures that are typically displayed in their boxes as they are collectibles. In this case, the figurines were customized to resemble the individual they were gifted to and were a huge hit. Everybody loved them and how personal they were.

Over the past several months everyone has kept them proudly displayed in their boxes on their desks. Until today.

My coworker (62F), came in to my office just excited as can be. She said I had to go to her desk to see what she did. She proceeds to tell me that she finally got around to taking the little figurine I got her our of the box and cut up the box to get her name off of it for the figurine to hold like a nameplate.

My heart just dropped when she told me she cut up the box as it is part of the customization and collectible. I told her I was busy with a project and couldn't break away to come look quite yet.

I 100% recognize that it is hers to do what she wishes with and that she doesn't understand the ""in the box"" concept and logically I am not upset. Emotionally, I cannot bring myself to look at it right now, an item that I spent time customizing that has now been cut up and part of it thrown away. After seeing how excited she was. I know she would expect me to just gush about how cute and clever it is and I don't know if I can do that quite yet.

WIBTA if I told her that what she did stung me and why? Or would a little white lie to avoid looking at it until I am feeling more neutral be a better option?

  
EDIT: Thank you for the quick responses! I appreciate the perspectives that this is her enjoying and showing appreciation for the gift. How she shows appreciation for this particular item is just different than how I do and that is perfectly acceptable. Me being an ass would only take away from it. My jets have been cooled.

Over the past several months everyone has kept them proudly displayed in their boxes on their desks. Until today.

My coworker (62F), came in to my office just excited as can be. She said I had to go to her desk to see what she did. She proceeds to tell me that she finally got around to taking the little figurine I got her our of the box and cut up the box to get her name off of it for the figurine to hold like a nameplate.

My heart just dropped when she told me she cut up the box as it is part of the customization and collectible. I told her I was busy with a project and couldn't break away to come look quite yet.

I 100% recognize that it is hers to do what she wishes with and that she doesn't understand the ""in the box"" concept and logically I am not upset. Emotionally, I cannot bring myself to look at it right now, an item that I spent time customizing that has now been cut up and part of it thrown away. After seeing how excited she was. I know she would expect me to just gush about how cute and clever it is and I don't know if I can do that quite yet.

WIBTA if I told her that what she did stung me and why? Or would a little white lie to avoid looking at it until I am feeling more neutral be a better option?

  
EDIT: Thank you for the quick responses! I appreciate the perspectives that this is her enjoying and showing appreciation for the gift. How she shows appreciation for this particular item is just different than how I do and that is perfectly acceptable. Me being an ass would only take away from it. My jets have been cooled.

25,1ecz10d,AITA for telling my mother to stop using my hair products?,"I (17m) have been growing out my hair for the last 8/9 years and it has grown to an amazing length of roughly 30 inches. My hair is quite thick and coarse however it is quite dry and slightly damaged. Because of this, I bought sulfate-free shampoos, conditioners and hair masks. These products cost more and I tend to run out of them in about two months. I pay for these myself, using the money I earn. 

Earlier today, I noticed that the bottles had been switched around and a lot of the product was not there. My mom (50f) is the only other person with long hair in the household so naturally I asked her. She seemed quite pissed off at me for asking that question so I tried to approach the situation lightly. I told her about them being sulfate-free and how I won't be able to keep on going out to restock them and spend excessive money. I followed this up by saying 'Could you please use a different shampoo we have?'. This caused her to start screaming at me, saying how I'm selfish and don't like to share anything and how I keep everything for myself.

I have never done anything like that before. I usually pay for the groceries, gas + electric bill, contribute to the water bill and any other expenses we have. This is the one time I asked her to let me keep something for myself that is for my health. 

My hair is very important to me and I know how some people may find that weird mainly because I'm a guy however, I like it clean, healthy and smooth. I follow this hair care routine for an amazing woman who I love. She asks if she can braid my hair and I let her have free reign since it always puts a beautiful smile on her face (and makes me feel like a Disney princess). However if I can't maintain my hair to the standard I do, it will look horrible and our special moments together won't happen anymore.

For some people, it may just seem small and shampoo but honestly, to me it's something really important so I do hope you consider every aspect.

27,1ecykah,AITA For staying home from a planned family weekend getaway,"This has all just literally happened in the past few hours.  My husband (37M), myself (35F), and our 2 kids (8 & 6) were supposed to travel out of state to spend the weekend at his mom's lake house.  One of my husband's cousins is there with his family and they have 2 kids the same age as ours.  My husband has been really looking forward to seeing his cousin because they haven't seen each other in over a year and they're really close.  

I've had a rough time the past few weeks though.  I've been struggling with my mental health for a while and am seeing a therapist for depression and also on medication.  We had a work meeting earlier this week and they announced upcoming layoffs so everyone is on edge at work.  I also got news the other day that my aunt got diagnosed with cancer.  Then, last night I discovered that my thighs and torso are covered in chigger bites from a hike I took with some friends the other day.  It looks like I have chicken pox and I feel itchy and gross.

Long story short, all I want to do this weekend is stay home.  The last thing I want to do is go to a lake and have to put on a swimsuit when I look like this.  I am also just not in a good place to socialize or be around people, even if they are family who I love.  

My husband took today off work so he could get us ready to go to beat traffic.  I could only take a half-day so I went to work this morning.  My boss told my department this morning that our team could be cut by up to 40%, they just don't know who it will be yet.  I'm freaking out.  

I texted my husband about it right after my boss told us and he responded with ""Sounds like a great excuse to get to the lake ASAP and start relaxing to take your mind off things.""  But by the time I got home, I really just didn't want to go.  When I got home and explained to him that I feel like I need to stay home, he just said ""Fine, stay home"" and kept packing the car.  

I tried to apologize to him and give my reasons for wanting to stay home and he cut me off and said ""I'm not going to force you to do anything you don't want to do.  But I do need you to know that I'm frustrated and upset that now my weekend is going to be much more difficult because of this and I don't really feel like talking about this right now.""  

I swear he packed the car faster than I've ever seen him before and rushed the kids and dog into the car while I was fighting off tears.  He didn't even give me a hug or kiss before they left.  I called my sister to vent because I was so upset and needed to talk to someone.  She told me that she doesn't really blame him because this has been planned for a while and I'm backing out at the very last minute.  

I've tried calling and texting my husband but he won't answer or respond even though I know his phone is connected to his car.

My wife and I work 9-5 and my step son goes to school 8am to 3pm (he's on summer break now).

I take turn cooking with my wife, one day I'll cook dinner and the next day she'll cook, just to keep it balanced for the both of us since we get pretty tired after work.
We always make sure to have left overs ready for launch the next day so the kids can heat it up in the microwave and have something to eat when we're not home.

On the weekends I do yard work and wash the vehicle, my wife cleans the house instead.
This has been working fine for us so far.

Last week I approached my step daughter and asked her if she could go easy on the cooking in the middle of the night because we're trying to make the food last.
She seemed to have understood what I told her but I noticed things didn't change and she keeps cooking in the middle of the night and also during the day even though we make sure to leave plenty of cooked food which everyone in the house eats.

My wife agrees with me and told her if she gets hungry during the day or night she can make herself a sandwich or have cereal if anything.
It doesn't help the fact that she doesn't wash any of the dishes after she cooks so when we get home from work we have to wash a bunch of plates, pots and utensils on top of the ones used for the meals we already prepare for them.

Today my step son got into an argument with his sister because he found her at 9am cooking the steaks for the family BBQ tomorrow. She was searing them on the stove which caused a small grease fire on the burner (I don't know what the heck she did) which cause the smoke detector to go off. Apparently her boyfriend was craving steaks and they forgot they were supposed to be for the BBQ (nobody believes that since we were planning it for the past 3 days).

I'm pretty upset that she cooks all the food at night or during the day but at the same time I don't like having to tell people they shouldn't eat when they're hungry, it doesn't feel morally right to say that. My wife said I wasn't being unreasonable and she agrees that there should be rules when it comes to cooking and making the food last.
She brought up a valid point when she mentioned that me and her are the only ones paying for all the house expenses as we're the only people working.

She was there for me wholeheartedly, and we became incredibly close because of it. Jane is very religious, and while I‚Äôm not, I went to church with her and supported her beliefs. She met her now-husband at church, and they decided to get married after dating for a short time. I was genuinely happy for them and excited to attend their wedding.

Although, I don't really know many of her friends. We‚Äôre a youngish group, all under 25, and many of us are still studying and don‚Äôt have a lot of money. Jane had a pretty extensive bridal registry with expensive items that I couldn‚Äôt afford. I got her something small but still felt bad about it. When she sent out the wedding invitations, she specified that only married couples were allowed plus ones. I was fine with that since it was her wedding, but it meant I had to attend alone since my long-term boyfriend wasn‚Äôt invited.

On top of that, I have severe food allergies. I never expect special treatment but do like to know beforehand so I can plan accordingly. I asked Jane if it would be possible to have a special meal prepared for me, and she assured me it was taken care of.

When I arrived at the wedding, I didn‚Äôt know anyone except for Jane‚Äôs bridesmaid (who was busy) and one other girl from church. It was awkward, but I tried to make small talk and enjoyed the ceremony. During the reception, I realized I was seated at a table with strangers. When dinner was served, I reminded the waiter about my special meal. The dish looked exactly like everyone else‚Äôs, which was concerning because of my allergies. I started eating but quickly felt sick and realized the meal wasn‚Äôt safe for me.

Feeling unwell and with no other food options, I decided to leave. The wedding was running much later than expected, and I had a long drive home through a remote area. I also have mild night blindness, which makes driving at night challenging. I went up to Jane, apologized, and explained that I needed to leave earlier than anticipated. I didn‚Äôt go into detail about my food issues or how sick I felt. But she looked visibly disgusted at me. 

Since the wedding, Jane hasn‚Äôt spoken to me. I sent a message afterward, but her reply was brief. I later found out she moved to another country, overseas, which she didn‚Äôt mention to me. I feel terrible about leaving her wedding early and wonder if I should have reached out more or handled the situation differently. Afterall, I don't think she knew my circumstances.

I feel awkward reaching out to her now but I guess I should just try to explain everything better? It might not even help though. ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-26,"AITA for leaving my friend‚Äôs wedding early? I (22F) have a friend, let‚Äôs call her Jane (23F), who supported me through a very difficult time a few years ago. She was there for me wholeheartedly, and we became incredibly close because of it. Jane is very religious, and while I‚Äôm not, I went to church with her and supported her beliefs. She met her now-husband at church, and they decided to get married after dating for a short time. I was genuinely happy for them and excited to attend their wedding.

Although, I don't really know many of her friends. We‚Äôre a youngish group, all under 25, and many of us are still studying and don‚Äôt have a lot of money. Jane had a pretty extensive bridal registry with expensive items that I couldn‚Äôt afford. I got her something small but still felt bad about it. When she sent out the wedding invitations, she specified that only married couples were allowed plus ones.

34,1ecx9ju,AITA for trying to help my friend,"
At work I (29) had a group of friends, we were all very loyal to each other and cared about each others feelings. 

I went out with 2 friends I used to work with and C who I still work with but not really friends outside of chatting at work sometimes. Me and C weren't drinking as we were driving but the 2 other girls were. C mentioned something about my good friend at work, B, that she had bad b.o, and one of the girls agreed, both said it in a nasty way. I was shocked as I had never noticed it before, and very annoyed that they were saying nasty things about her at all, especially to me since they knew I was goid friends with her. As one of the girls later reminded me I was very defensive for B and kept defending her, then I was talking with the other girl about how I felt so bad for B because she has such bad body image already, and how she shouldn't because she is very pretty and nice personality. 

I felt I needed to tell her as I would want to know if that's something people were saying about me, especially if it's something that can be easily fixed. 

When I went to work on Monday, I saw myself and B's friend E (B's best friend at work) and said to her about what happened, my main concern being worried about how B would react as I was worried she would spiral about her appearance. We both wondered how to say it to B in the nicest and most helpful way. I suggested bring her to dinner and saying in a gentle way what C said and that we're telling her because it's something I would want to know, and I've had problems with sweating alot so I know good deodorant to use. 

I saw E again on Wednesday and we talked about it again, she said her mom suggested we don't say it to her because we never noticed a B.O problem with her. I said that since I knew about it I know I can't not tell her. Then E said something about saying to B that C was talking bad behind B's back, I thought that was already a given seeing as how I said about telling B what C said already, it wasn't my main concern, how B would react and feel was. 

I was off work the next day, then on Friday me and B had the same shift at work, we had lunch together and I felt like she was in a good mindset and I was going to say to her what C had said (in a kind way obviously), the only reason I didn't was because I felt because I had involved E I should wait to say it with her or at least consult her. 

I went home from work and saw on instagram that B and E were at dinner. Then B left the group chat saying she was sure we'd find out why soon. I sent her a ? and she said E told her what C said and that I was 'basically trying to protect him' and how she's done with me. E never spoke to me since then so I don't know how she came to that conclusion. I never wasn't going to tell B that C said that, I was never close to him and only sometimes talked to him at work.

I wasn't implying that she couldn't. I just thought because she has so many and already barley have time for them it maybe worth asking just in case. I wasn't trying to imply anything. I Honestly have no idea how she feels because of the interpretation and being shut down so quickly like that.

We had known each other all throughout highschool but we got really close junior and senior year. I'm gay and go to a Catholic school so I didn't really have anyone to go with to prom. I didn't want to go alone so I asked Jocelin if she wanted to go together as friends. She said she was contemplating whether she wanted to go with a group of friends and for the time being it was yes but there was a chance it would change. With that said we starting planning our outfits.

 There was this one vintage Jessica McLintock dress on eBay that she liked but it was too expensive. I helped her get the dress by absolutely bombarding this poor seller with offers below asking price till she lowered the price of the dress and sold it to her for cheap. The dress was mint green so I got a vintage mint green tuxedo shirt to match. She said that her accessories were all going to be pink so i should get a pink suit. I didn't have a pink suit but I did have a peachy beige suit that I thought would work and she said it would probably be fine. About a month before prom she decided that she didn't want to go together anymore and gave me $20 to pay for the shirt ( the shirt was 15 + shipping) the next day she asked what I was planning on wearing and I said the mint shirt with the suit because our outfits as it was didn't really match that much anyway. She asked why I took the $20 then if I ""wasn't going to buy a new shirt"" and I pulled the money out and said she could have it back if she wanted. She declined. The week before prom I had again asked her if what I was wearing was ok and she said she was fine with it. 

Fast forward to prom, we both took pictures and got food with a mutual group of friends and I could tell that she was upset. All night anything I asked her or talked to her about got short one word responses. I decided to ignore it. The next day people were messaging me saying that all night she had been posting pictures of me on Snapchat and Instagram with captions like ""ugh this is so annoying"" or ""this is unbelievable"".

My grandmother passed away and the trust indicates that if any family member wishes to buy the house, they must do so within 3 months. We are almost at the 3 months. My uncle called me to say that he doesn't want to buy the house but he might need to because my aunt might be losing her job and need to find a job closer to where the house is located. However she wont know if she is losing her job until 2025 (long outside of the timeline to purchase). And then not put it on the market until the following spring. My uncle wants to know if I would be willing to wait until they find out if she loses her job before he decides to purchase it. He said he will get the house evaluated and if the house loses value, he will still honor the initial estimate.  
Morally, I understand his dilemma. My aunt and uncle took care of my grandmother during her final years (my mom would have done it, had she not passed away). I almost instantly said yes, that's fine. I can wait 10 months. However, he told me to sleep on it. Realistically now that it's settled, some of this is turning me off. My uncle is very wealthy and has all the means to buy whatever lawyer he wishes. I do not. I cannot afford a probate lawyer to help me if in the event something goes haywire while we are outside of the agreement of the trust. I also am a little confused as to why my aunt ""needs"" to live there? It's a 4BR house. Why does she need a 4br house? Why can't she just get an apartment? We have never been close family.

My uncle called me to say that he doesn't want to buy the house but he might need to because my aunt might be losing her job and need to find a job closer to where the house is located. However she wont know if she is losing her job until 2025 (long outside of the timeline to purchase). And then not put it on the market until the following spring. My uncle wants to know if I would be willing to wait until they find out if she loses her job before he decides to purchase it. He said he will get the house evaluated and if the house loses value, he will still honor the initial estimate.  
Morally, I understand his dilemma. My aunt and uncle took care of my grandmother during her final years (my mom would have done it, had she not passed away). I almost instantly said yes, that's fine. I can wait 10 months. However, he told me to sleep on it. Realistically now that it's settled, some of this is turning me off. My uncle is very wealthy and has all the means to buy whatever lawyer he wishes. I do not. I cannot afford a probate lawyer to help me if in the event something goes haywire while we are outside of the agreement of the trust. I also am a little confused as to why my aunt ""needs"" to live there? It's a 4BR house. Why does she need a 4br house? Why can't she just get an apartment? We have never been close family. I can count on my fingers and toes how many times I've seen them outside of a wedding or funeral. AITA for wanting to sell it now instead of next spring? ",0.0,0.01115064974874258,0,1
39,1ecwvcx,AITA for not allowing my nephew to sleep in the same bed as her GF?,"Im taking care of my 18yo nephew for 2 weeks while my sister is on her honeymoon.  
I love my nephew and iv always been the ""cool aunt"" iv always covered for him I always was someone he could come to.  
However, since he stayed in my place, hes been bringing this friend over to my place and i found them kissing semi nude on the guestroom. I told him i was going to make a huge effort to keep him out of trouble BUT that she was not to enter the living area again.

I woke up a few days ago to them making breakfast and they said that she just got there.

No way in hell thats real.

They are both ""adults"" and to be fair, if he was a bit older i wouldn't even mind him having a girl over as soon as they are respectful. 

We are now at our family lake cabin, and he has been begging me not to embarrass him by not allowing them both to share a bed. I said no way.

The girls parents gave her permission to come over to the lake, but im sure they would not agree to this.

40,1ecwm8a,AITA for taking money from my Cousin??,"My wife thinks I am being an asshole on this one. Please assume the facts I am giving here are true. 

10 years ago, my Uncle stole $20,000 from my grandfathers estate that was due to be split and then go to my father and then me. This money was proceeds from sale of some land that was supposed to be split evenly, and somehow my uncle was able to manipulate the transaction so my father did not know the sale was taking place, nor did my father receive funds. The family decided to ""let it go"" and not prosecute. 

Recently it was discovered (because my uncle passed away) that there is a trust account where I am the trustee of funds my uncle left for his son. (my cousin) I am the trustee because there were other deaths and I am the only one ""left around"". My cousin is well off, doesn't need the money in any way.

Because of my autism, I have a special interest in the children‚Äôs show PAW Patrol. It is a huge aspect of my life and personality, and I find myself often collecting merchandise from the show. One of my spare bedrooms is decorated completely PAW patrol based, and the walls are covered in shelves where I display my figures/plushies.

Onto the story now, my older sister (29f) asked to stay with me for a week or two with her two kids (11 and 9 m) because I have an empty room, and her and her husband had been having really bad arguments nonstop and she needed to take a break and make sure it wouldn‚Äôt affect her children‚Äôs emotional health.

Early Wednesday morning, they came to my place and I settled them into the guest room (different from the room I keep my merchandise.) and had to go to work at about 7:00 A.M.

I came home from work later on to the children asleep on my couch and my sister having a shower. Once I had went into my merchandise room to check up on it, it was a mess.

47,1ecvrny,WIBTA if I didn't pay my portion of utilities for a month?,"Hi all, 

The decision has not been made yet, so I am asking just to see if this would be a dick move, or if it makes sense.

I shared a house with 3 other roommates. We split rent evenly, then each pay 1/4 of the utility bill each month. My one roommate, Chantelle, has the utilities in her name and we each pay our share.

I moved out completely on the first of July. I wanted to end the lease at the end of June, but Chantelle said she wanted to wait until the end of July because she was not ready to move. I am mentioning this to clarify that there would have been no way to fill my room because we rent the whole house, not room by room, so unless we all had decided to end the lease in June, then there is no way to fill the individual rooms/floors. 

I came back mid-July to spend a day cleaning the floor I lived on (did the whole deep clean this day). However, I was not there at any other point, and my stuff was gone (I had some stuff in the garage still but I picked it up on the deep clean day - this did not impede my roommate's ability to park in the garage). 

It is the end of July, and she has asked that I pay my part in utilities. In my mind, I was not there using water/wi-fi/electricity. I would be okay with, at most, paying for a portion of the electricity since the AC was still in use throughout the whole house, and my fridge was still on. I also paid rent for the month despite not being there - the rent is not the issue, I was obviously a bit upset I could have saved a month's rent if we all moved out in June, but oh well.

50,1ecvlld,AITA for attempting to abandon my responsibility of taking care of my elderly grandmother?,"For starters, I know this is a ride of a title. 

In April, my grandfather (87) got into a terrible car accident, and ultimately passed in the following weeks. I had been living with them prior, and took up the care of my grandmother (87). 

For multiple years, I (21F) have believed that she needs significant care that I nor my grandfather have been able to care for aptly. I myself am chronically ill and my grandfather was very up in age, she is unsteady and gets herself into physically challenging issues. She is on a slew of medications that are very hard to keep up with (15+). She doesn‚Äôt have the physicality to get up throughout the day or turn herself. She has previously gotten bed sores and other complications due to this inactivity. She also has short term dementia. 

During the stay in the hospital, I took a month leave to care for her (and at the time the potential for his at-home hospice care), and have since taken on the larger burden of things for her. I am finding it impossible to maintain decent work hours with her behavior and demanding needs. 

I feel terribly as my mother (60), stepfather and I originally moved here to help them when I was ~15. We stayed throughout my time in high school (2017-2021). My mother moved back across the country to live near my sister (35)  and her children (4 & 7) when I went to university. I moved back during my freshman year (2022) as I fell very ill and could not complete my schooling. 

I feel trapped in this responsibility. No one in my family is willing to help. My sister (who is currently being made to be trustee and financial power of attorney) cannot move here as her husband is on parole. My mom is refusing to move her to care for her mother, despite working from home. My remaining family works full time jobs and has children. 

My sister has threatened me with blackmail, claiming that she ‚Äúknows more than (I) think (she) does‚Äù, but has given no detail as to what she think she knows. She claims that this is the least I can do. 

I have given everything up for my family. I gave up my childhood to parent my mother, cooking all the meals, drawing up my mother‚Äôs baths, doing laundry and all cleaning, and going even as far as having to sing her to sleep. I gave up my dream school, as my mom begged for me to choose the closer option, despite her moving across the country the day I moved into my dorm. I opted out of returning to school right off to help my grandparents while I could. 

My mother is insistent that we cannot put my grandma in a home as that will eat up her assets and we will be unable to pay for the mortgage.

Her friends all have kids around the same age   as ours, but the husbands do not want to what they want to do or are too busy doing other things. Her mother lives alone.

It's hard for her to tell them after a long week at work, we just want to hang out as a family and do what we want to do, when we want to do it. Having other people there and coordinating is pressure we dont want.

54,1ecv62j,AITA for playing DND with my GF's ex? ,"Background: My Gf (26F) and I (24M) have been dating for around 2 years, but before that we were friends for years and then roommates for years. We have a great relationship, we still goof around like we always have, we communicate well, we often discuss futures together, it's the best. However there's one argument we sometimes circle back to that I want to get other perspectives on. 



Before we started dating, GF was seeing ex (26M) for like two years on and off. The relationship ended poorly and they no longer communicate in any way. Before they broke up, however, he was often around the house where GF and I were roommates and we became pretty friendly, eventually discovering that we both love DND and starting a group together with a couple other friends. We discussed starting this group while they were together and made a start date (waiting for one of the other members of the party to move to our city), then they had their final break-up, then a few months later we started playing. At this point my GF and I were just normal, casual friends and roommates. Around 3 months into our DND campaign my GF and I went on a trip to Europe with some friends and by the time we came back we were together. 



As our relationship developed, it was too early to put any labels on it and certainly too early for her to make an ask of me like stopping this game I love for such a new relationship ‚Äì as time went on it got trickier. We got more involved and fell more in love, but the group was going on longer and the story was getting deeper and more profound.

In-person (I've tried online and really couldn't get into it), and D. in a group that's gone on as long as this one has (for anyone who doesn't know DND, meeting semi-regularly for two years is extremely rare and coveted). It's a special opportunity, and though it's a little awkward every now and then to play with her ex, it's really not that social of a group save for like 25 minutes of chit chat when we're getting ready to play. 

  
My GF doesn't love this setup and is uncomfortable with having this guy in her life in any capacity.

From the start he has been very flirty with me, even before meeting IRL. I have never really been flirted with before and I have a hard time understanding hints so I really didn't want to think that he's flirting if he isn't. But I'll give some examples.

He made me feel like someone can love me before I could even love myself and I developed feelings for him rather quickly, but then as time went on, stuff he did threw me off.. after 'flirting' with me he would randomly talk about a girl he used to like, or a date he went on.

All was fine.

Then my mom said she could use a dryer but she is on a low budget. So I decided to give the dryer to my mom because I can afford a new one. 

Now my ex found out that I promised it to my mom and is completely furious about it.

Edit 2: I'm seeing several comments saying I should've told her beforehand. The thought of telling her that she and her dog aren't welcome anymore, therefore no one else in the group is, just feels... mean but if anyone has suggestions on how I can word that for future references feel free to do so!

I don't like dogs, never been fond of them but I don't judge people who have dogs as long as they are responsible. I have a group of friends and we like to host events at our houses like parties, potlucks, game night, etc. About two months ago, my friend got a service dog for her seizures and I was already planning on hosting a potluck but I didn't want a dog in my house (she sheds a *lot*), so I decided to chose a camping area where we can all have fun and enjoy since it would be so fucked up to deny my friend from coming over with a dog that she *needs*

This has been going on ever since my friend (let's call her Sarah) got a service dog. Today was my turn to host and one of my friends (say, Jacob) suggested we do a game night. I told them that I would rather have events outside of my house and, well, we don't have anything to connect my Ps4 outside with. I suggested maybe we can do a movie night instead and go out to the movies

Jacob was confused and asked why I stopped doing game night at my house and I explained that I don't want *animals (I'm so sorry I said pets, that was wrong of me, I didn't catch that) in my house, let alone a dog that sheds. No one batted an eye but Sarah started to question me, like if she's no longer welcome in my house, if I am ableist and I told her that I would rather host things outside of my house if she's going to need a service dog. The times we all spend together are arranged in advanced. I chose to do things away from my house so that I wouldn't have to have the dog in my house. If I had a the type of arrangement that meant coming over to my house, I would make myself put up with a hairy situation but I don't have to in this current arrangement

Sarah was not having it and started to call me ableist and unfair to her and her dog, that I've changed ever since she had her service dog and I was baffled about everything she was saying. We ended up not hosting anything and it ended up being so awkward that everybody started to leave the group call. I honestly can't tell if I should be ashamed of myself.

A band I have worshipped for 10 years, who rarely play live, are playing in the Netherlands in November. My sister has been living there for 5 years and I've never visited. I bought tickets to the concert, soon I will have to get tickets for the plane and accommodation. I made a rough budget for everything landing me at $2600 roughly, for 5 days there. For context I'm Canadian.

My wife says I'm selfish for wanting to go. We just had a baby in May, we have a 2 year old boy, we both recently have completed some big jobs (we're both freelancers), so money is OK right now. Not the best, but OK. I've explained all the points above, and told her that I'm getting somewhat under the pressure with the family, etc. A trip like this would be a great reset for me.

More context: we live in the same city as our parents, so my family and her family have always been there to help us out with the kids, enthusiastically. We also are about to go on a mini vacation to a cabin in the summer as well.

My wife's main point is that I want to get away, and that's what bothers her. So, AITA?

EDIT:

The internet has spoken, I am the asshole. I humbly accept the label. Thanks all for pitching in, though this one seems like a lowball now in retrospect.

My friend has always described herself as a people pleaser and has actively worked to undue those tendencies which is amazing for her. I‚Äôm so proud. Personally, I have always been a matter of fact person and say how I feel about things. 
Recently my friend and I have had a few disagreements about things where I feel like she doesn‚Äôt try to meet me half way. Last week after a spat, i explained to her I never receive an apology from her but i will apologize for my part in things. She said that wasn‚Äôt true but I told her we will have to have a talk about that when we have time. 

Currently I live almost two hours away from our home town. While visiting my home town, i was supposed to drop something off my for fiance but I was 40 mins on the road when I realized I forgot. I knew my friend was also traveling and would be passing by my town to go back to our home town just a few days later. I explained the situation to her and I asked her if she could pick up the item and deliver it to her friend who lives close to her whenever she got back. She agreed. A few days later, when I call and ask her when she was going to be in town to pick up the item and she said she didn‚Äôt have time. I asked if she just had a moment to pick it up since I‚Äôm just off the freeway. She insisted she didn‚Äôt have the time. No apology or anything. I got off the phone because I was annoyed and needed a moment. I called her back and expressed I was frustrated mostly because I get frustrated when people flake.

She told me I didn‚Äôt need to tell her how to smooth things over and that I didn‚Äôt properly communicate the importance of what I asked. I asked her if she felt like if things aren‚Äôt important she can blow them off. She said I offended her because that‚Äôs not the type of person she is.

I was taken aback because what I was upset about was not that she couldn‚Äôt do it but because she didn‚Äôt care she couldn‚Äôt do it after agreeing to it and is making it my fault for her forgetting and not prioritizing it.

61,1ecu51u,AITA for eating my boyfriend‚Äôs leftovers? ,"This is from an old relationship, but after reading some stuff on the thread, I guess I started wondering whether or not I was in the wrong. 

My ex 29M and I 23F (at the time), had eaten Thai takeout the night before. I paid because I was the one that suggested we eat in since I was tired of cooking every day. I think he had ordered Pad Thai and I ordered Pad see ew. 

The night we ordered in he had put away his leftovers and fell asleep before I did. I finished my dinner and later that night was craving food. I (without thinking and being kind of careless) figured he wouldn‚Äôt mind if I ate the leftovers since I usually made him breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. I eat, enjoy myself, and go back to bed. 

We wake up the following morning and I‚Äôm working in the living room while having coffee. He went to the fridge looking for his leftovers, and obviously they were gone because I‚Äôd eaten them. He was pretty livid. I apologized profusely and asked if he wanted me to make him breakfast, but he began to ask me if I‚Äôd vomited. He asked me how I could eat that much and kept telling me I must‚Äôve purged the night before. 

Back story my ex knew I had and was struggling with an ED. I had a history of bulimia and other disordered eating. 

Eventually we got to the point where he told me he didn‚Äôt believe me no matter how much I said I really hadn‚Äôt purged. He went and picked up the scale we had in the bathroom and told me to step on it. He said he wanted to see for his own eyes what my weight was so he could find out if I had purged or not. That being said‚Ä¶ I broke down bawling. He said it was a joke, but it really broke something in me deep down that hadn‚Äôt been triggered around my weight in years. I can see how this could be more of an internal issue and how I took the joke too personally, but it still feels as if that experience was unjustified on his part. 

So I guess I‚Äôm just asking if it was my fault and IWBTA since I ate his leftovers without asking?

I don‚Äôt want to hurt her feelings because she is a kind soul and I feel like I should just keep quiet but already asked. She said sorry if I overstepped. Idk how to be less of an AH to answer‚Ä¶ I know social media sucks so that‚Äôs why i try to post less and I‚Äôm usually too busy to think about it. But once in a while is nice. I never would post other people‚Äôs kids unless they are playing with mine maybe, the rest of the family never posts anything because they think it‚Äôs not their place. I think it‚Äôs wise. 

When my first was born I specifically asked that no one posts until we do. Especially because everyone visited 1-2h after I gave birth and i had to wait for them to leave so I can even eat‚Ä¶ I should just be thankful for the nice photos probably and think positive. My boy is autistic too so that makes milestones very hard to achieve if ever. But thanks anyway if you know how I could feel less of an AH asking her. ",0.0,1.0028060674667358,1,0

And the gym assigned them with a female trainer (I guess F29 ) .. so he never told me(F24) except she‚Äôs a celebrity trainer from their hometown (My bf is an Indian) . So, one day he showed the video he recorded from the gym. The video is his friend is lifting and the female trainer is coaching him from the side.. that‚Äôs it.  So I saw her face..

67,1ecsofs,AITA for not inviting my sister to my wedding?,"So my (31F) fiance (33M) and I are getting married this summer.  We've been planning our wedding for what seems like forever (over a year) and are starting to iron out final details like seating arrangements.  Everything has been going smoothly until my sister (29F) requested she bring a special guest.

But first some context on my sister that I feel is relevant.  My fiance is technically one of my sister's exes.  BUT, they were broken up when we got together, and their relationship was not particularly serious. They dated for a little less than a year, and my fiance and I didn't go on our first date until about five months after they parted ways.  This did lead to some initial awkwardness between my sister and me, and she started to act differently.  After taking some time to be single, she decided to travel, started an OnlyFans and generally became interested in self-exploration.  Family and I were supportive with all of this (my parents don't know about the OF), and my sister seemed to be ok with my fiance and me being together.  It's now been about three year since then and while we are not incredibly close, we have a good relationship.

NOW, the special guest.  Part of my sister's self-exploration was seeking therapy and ways to improve her mental health.  She got very into the idea of getting a pet, especially a non-traditional one.  After discussing it with her therapist, she decided on a pet goat... you can see where this is going.

Sister has become INCREDIBLY attached to said goat, taking it on walks, cooking it home made meals, and generally treating it like her own child.  Again, my family and I were all supportive of this as it was a positive influence in her life and goats are harmless.  But my sister wants to bring Buttercup to my wedding.

I thought she was joking when she told me she wants to bring Buttercup. I obviously did not picture a barn animal at my wedding.  It will be indoors, and I know my sister will want Buttercup next to her at all times.  But it gets more complicated, as my fiance and I initially said absolutely not, and my parents (who are paying for half the wedding) have gotten involved and want us to allow Buttercup to attend.  At this point I'm torn, part of me wants to say OK to prevent another fallout with my sister that will include my parents, but the thought of a goat being in my wedding photos makes me feel like the wedding will be a joke. Also, this animal is constantly going to the bathroom and I don't even know what arrangements I could make to keep the venue clean in the event of an accident (it's a converted barn so it's not like this would be happening in a formal event hall or church or anything, but still).  This is supposed to be a big wedding with lots of friends and family from both sides, so at this point picking a different venue or not taking my parents money is out of the question.

68,1ecsj5a,AITA for blaming my unhealthy eating habits on my parents?,"I [16F] blamed my parents last night for causing me to have a supposed eating disorder due to my upbringing. 

For context: I have never had a good relationship with food since I was young. My mother [40F] would always narrate stories of how I refused to eat any meals like rice, pastas or chicken until I was 5 years old, after several of my teeth were pulled for cavities. When I was 8 years old, my dad [43M] took my to a routine doctors appointment, where my paediatric doctor told me I was underweight. In my fathers mind, I suppposed he heard that I was different and always going to be different; he began asking if I was anorexic and when the doctor replied that it may be the case, he bolted us out of the doctors office and never spoke of it again. Since I just moved schools around this time and struggled to make friends due to bullying, I stopped eating lunches at school and when my presents discovered this, I was shouted, ridiculed and grounded for some time. 

Now, I still have a difficult relationship with food. I still now only eat a proper meal a day, skipping out on breakfast and lunch at school because I didn't want to spend money on food at the cafeteria. We didn't grow up poor, but my parents always reminded me that I should save more money than I spend so I wouldn't be struggling with bills and living paycheck to paycheck like we were. I guess the stressful situations in my life, often caused by my parents would cause me to stop eating. 

So, when my parents began commenting on my appearance like they always do, saying how it would be less embarrassing if I looked more like my cousins, I finally snapped. I told them how their neglect of my eating habits only caused it to worsen, and how the insane amount of responsibilities that I had to deal with only made me stress. I guess I can see their side, seeing as they did their best to provide us with food on the table.

So redditors, AITA? and if so should I apologise to my parents. We're currently not speaking as they have cut out and removed access to my money.

EDIT: For those asking what type of disorder it may be or what reasons could cause me not eating, it's probably often caused by a lack of desire to eat, and even when I do feel hungry I don't feel like eating due to things like textures of food. Also, for those saying that my eating habits are my fault as I should know what a good eating habit includes, I would like to say that I do but I still don't want to eat at times, especially when I realised if I eat a bit during the day it can suffice throughout the whole day/night. 

UPDATE: I did apologise to my parents for my behaviour and outbursts but it hasn't stopped their distant treatment towards me; I still haven't gotten my money back which isn't good as I would need it if I needed to buy food since I work throughout the week.

I also love making decorations. My BF is a DJ, and bake in my free time. So when we plan parties i take on 90% of the planning and sorting. I always ask my sisters to help but they always say theyre too busy. On the rare occassion they do offer some input or if they want to provide something, It always gets used.

I would like to visit my parents this year for Christmas. 

My partner is supportive and would be joining too. His parents live in the same area as we do so we plan to split the holidays and spend Thanksgiving with his family local to us.

My parents are moving away to be closer to my mom‚Äôs dad who is currently living independently but is aging and will eventually need assistance in the next handful of years. My grandpa used to live in the same area as my parents but moved away several years ago to seek independence and because he disagrees with the political climate of the previous state has lived in (he and my parents are very conservative). 
I have mixed feelings about the dynamics surrounding my parent‚Äôs and grandpa‚Äôs moves from CA to AZ, which is probably better suited for another post. 

But my main question is‚Ä¶ AITA for asking my parents to contribute to our flights (~$300 round trip per person) to visit them for Xmas? Granted we would have free rooming with them/my grandpa. I would offer to contribute to food $$ when there. I am also not sure how to approach the finances of Xmas gifts. Typically we get them smaller things/not crazy expensive. I almost want to ask them (and my grandpa) if they could put any gift money they were planning to spend towards the cost of our flight. But I feel like that would take away from the Xmas festivities?
Cost of living is expensive where my partner and I live, we are conscientious of how we spend our money. I also have minimal-to-no available time to take off of work. Right now we are prioritizing building our life together and I‚Äôm just not really sure how to approach this visiting during the holidays thing. My parents have indicated that they don‚Äôt plan to travel anymore for the holidays and I doubt my grandpa will travel over the next coming years.

I‚Äôm not overly bothered by it, he‚Äôs only betting small amounts under $10 doesn‚Äôt have any other gambling addictions. He also loves to talk about the upcoming draws, and when someone wins, he‚Äôd always be upset and talk about ‚ÄúCan you believe it? They won xx$! Why not me?

He also LOVES to discuss what we‚Äôd do with the money if we won. Pretty much every single time he buys a ticket. So, almost weekly! 
I am not into lotto, I‚Äôm more of a pragmatic person. Honestly, I find these conversations quite annoying. I have entertained it multiple times and it was nice to dream about traveling the world and helping out our families, friends, charities, etc. But talking about it again and again just really irritates me.

73,1ecqwcm,AITA for calling my roomate stupid for bringing back a hookup.,"

So I (22 F) and my roommate (22 F) have been living together for about a year. This is their first time living outside their parents home while I've been living on my own since I was 18. She is queer and hasn't had a lot of experiences with women, so she started joining dating apps. I encouraged her to do so and go out to meet more LGBT people. So one day she comes back home while I'm in the living room and tells me that she has someone coming over in 2 hours. I ask who and she tells me that's its a girl she meet on a dating app. 
While I wasn't too happy with the late notice I let it go and was excited for her. The girl came over and we greeted each other then they both went back to my roommate's room. I decided to head to a friend's house to binge watch a show and to give them space. 
I need up texting my roomate a little while later because I had forgotten about our trash that needed taken to the road. They text me saying that they had left for work, which I was surprised about since her date had brought alcohol over for the two of them. 
My roomate then proceeded to tell that the two of them had been drinking and she had left her date at our place by herself while she went to work and a friend was coming over to make sure the date got back safety.
I was livid she had never meet this girl nor knew or meet the ""friend"" and had left this drunk girl outside our place with no one home.
I had to drive home by myself and stay at our house by myself all night. I ended up laying into them saying that they are stupid and if they ever did anything like again I would kick them out. 
My roomate doesn't seem to understand what they did wrong and stated that the date told them it was ok to go ahead to work, which personally made me even more mad and I stated "" If you ever put me or my household into that kind of danger again you won't have a place here"". Which seemed to scare or upset them. 

AITA?


EDIT

Sorry if I confused people. I was trying to shorten the story down. To clarify some things from the comments:
1. Me and my roommate spoke about guests, and I told them I don't have an issue as long as they give me a 24 hour heads up just so I know. Vice versa with me. 

2.  She just stated that she left the girl there at the house. She later explained that she planned to leave the girl there inside the house, but the date insisted on waiting outside. 

3. I did blow up at her original, and later on, I tried to calmly explain why I was upset, but this turned into a bigger issue with her yelling at me and then ignoring me several days after. It all boiled over after that point. ",Not enough info,2024-07-26,"AITA for calling my roomate stupid for bringing back a hookup.

74,1ecqo3d,AITA for using my dog to scare the neighborhood cats?,"My (33f) neighbors have cats. Lots of cats roaming the entire neighborhood freely. Our house is on the corner and we have a few cats that use our backyard as a cut through and hangout spot. It‚Äôs annoying to say the least, can‚Äôt put a bird feeder out, cat poop in the yard that my dogs eat, etc. 

I‚Äôve talked to my neighbors but, even though their cats match the descriptions of the cats in my yard, apparently these are shockingly all not theirs.

We put a fence in and got some backyard chickens in a little section that roam during the day and are locked in a coop at night. Unsurprisingly, I hear commotion and see my neighbors not-cat attacking the chickens, so I just instinctively yelled to my dog and said ‚Äúcat! there‚Äôs a cat!‚Äù‚Ä¶ and my dog bolted into action and chased the cat away. Nobody saw it. I felt bad, but I mean‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what else to do. When they‚Äôre there and I yell at them or something, they just do the tail whip and stay in place like little gremlins. I‚Äôve had to throw rocks to get the cats to leave. Then they shit in my yard during the night. 

So I‚Äôve just started letting the dog out every time I see a cat. Well‚Ä¶ today, my dog cornered my neighbors cat. She would‚Äôve gotten it had I not told her to stop, but she‚Äôs very obedient and just kept it cornered. No cats were harmed. I yelled at the cat to get away and saw where it dug under the fence to get in. 

My neighbors MIL saw the whole thing, and it‚Äôs their cat. I like my neighbors (generally) and I feel guilty but idk what to do.

76,1ecqc7p,AITA for continuing to share location with my friends against my fianc√©'s wishes?,"So my fianc√© and I share location with each other and I am happy to do so. He voluntarily shared his location with me way before I started sharing with him. It was a personal hang up I had about sharing locations with a boyfriend that caused my delay in sharing mine back. He took that to mean that I don't share my location with anyone whatsoever as a personal boundary. Sometimes I would share my location with him for a day (if I was traveling somewhere for work), but would always turn it back off. I finally shared my location with him permanently about a year ago, once I knew we were getting married and all was well.

A few months ago, the location sharing thing came up and I mentioned I share with my two best friends, Amanda and Emma, and have for some time. He was not happy about that and asked when it started and why. I explained it was a safety thing from when I was single and going on dates and because of the work travel. I probably put my foot in my mouth on that one a bit. He feels really hurt because I was so restrictive about sharing my location with him, even once we were back together and really locked in, while sharing it with others. He feels unrestricted access to your location is a marker of intimacy. I continue to share my location with the three of them, and it has come up several times in these past months. He now has formally said he would like me to stop sharing location with Emma / has asked me when it is going to stop.

For perspective, I have known Amanda for 15 years and Emma for 3. He and I have known each other for about 5 years because we dated in the past, broke up, and came back together eventually (right person, wrong time kind of situation). During the time we weren't together is when I met Emma. To add more context here, he is not a huge fan of Emma and is definitely more upset about the location sharing with her than he is Amanda. He tends to have a problem with a lot of things about Emma. I think it is partly because she is someone I met when I was on a single girl rampage and she is still somewhat in that space. I think it is also because when he and I first started dating again there were several situations where I prioritized Emma over him and it hurt him. To provide more context here, there is a significant age gap between us, and I explained to him that it is common that us millenials share location with friends. That's not something people his generation commonly do with anyone but maybe a spouse and their children, so he finds it strange.

I feel like I am between a rock and a hard place because my friends will know if I turn my location off, and then I will have to explain it.

78,1ecplyr,AITA for Confronting my friend while high,"I COMPLETELY EDITED CUZ I DIDNT REALIZE HOW MUCH IT MADE SENSE LOL
Just for some background: 
For a while now I‚Äôve been hanging out with three girls, Hailey, Gianna, and Maddie. They all happen to do drugs but I do not so I don‚Äôt know what being high is like or any of that. One of my closest friends (of a year), Maddie, decided to invite my friends Gianna and I to a musical festival. 

At first it was fine but when we got to the festival, we were just walking around but we figured out she was bringing Hailey, another friend of ours, however, none of us knew she was coming which was odd. We found it odd cuz Maddie invited her and didn‚Äôt tell us despite Hailey being a close friend. Maddie also brought her boyfriend. 
We continued to walk around and Maddie was w her bf and they were walking behind us, not talking to us. Later on that night she ended up leaving w him to go get eyedrops due to the fact she had gotten high earlier that night.
We had tried to calm her down at an isolated spot but she was alr being yelled at by her mom (from what she told us) on the phone and she was crying. So when she eventually left we were a bit upset that she left us with her boyfriend (ultimately we didn‚Äôt believe she was going to get eyedrops) and we left it at that. Later she came back but left us again but I think it was because she had to go home, even tho she told us she would leave at 10. 

The next day, Gianna and Hailey were a bit upset by what happened n we decided that I would text Maddie abt how upset we were and how we felt she left us for her boyfriend.

She continued to tell me that she was greened out, stressed, and that her mom was yelling at her so she couldn‚Äôt rly do anything. When I tried to express how we were upset she got mad and said she didn‚Äôt want to talk about serious shit nor did everything have to be serious. I replied with that I didn‚Äôt wanna make an issue out of anything and I just wanted to talk and resolve it.

She ended up blocking me alongside the other two girls, and a couple weeks later she decided she would friend 

Gianna n explain the situation in which Maddie explained how she was high n basically tje same thing she told me. She said that she wanted to talk to Hailey as well but when asked if she would talk to me, Hailey refused to and said she wouldn‚Äôt bc I was self absorbed, problematic, and that at least they weren‚Äôt as self absorbed like I was. I tried to send her an apology due to the fact I felt like I was being judgy when I confronted her instead of understanding her but she chose not to read it. I expressed to Gianna that it wasn‚Äôt that I didn‚Äôt care about the situation, is was that I couldn‚Äôt do anything if she blocked me on everything. I had tried to apologize for everything Maddie was mad at me for or stating I was and she just wasn‚Äôt hearing it so I don‚Äôt know what to do.i did end up apologizing through Gianna but Maddie didn‚Äôt wanna hear it. 

My main issue with the problem is that I wanted to know if I should‚Äôve reacted differently, and was I the asshole for reacting the way I did?

AITA? Should I have reacted differently in the situation in the first place? What should I do now? ",Asshole,2024-07-26,"AITA for Confronting my friend while high I COMPLETELY EDITED CUZ I DIDNT REALIZE HOW MUCH IT MADE SENSE LOL

So when she eventually left we were a bit upset that she left us with her boyfriend (ultimately we didn‚Äôt believe she was going to get eyedrops) and we left it at that. Later she came back but left us again but I think it was because she had to go home, even tho she told us she would leave at 10. 

The next day, Gianna and Hailey were a bit upset by what happened n we decided that I would text Maddie abt how upset we were and how we felt she left us for her boyfriend.

She continued to tell me that she was greened out, stressed, and that her mom was yelling at her so she couldn‚Äôt rly do anything. When I tried to express how we were upset she got mad and said she didn‚Äôt want to talk about serious shit nor did everything have to be serious. I replied with that I didn‚Äôt wanna make an issue out of anything and I just wanted to talk and resolve it.

She ended up blocking me alongside the other two girls, and a couple weeks later she decided she would friend 

Gianna n explain the situation in which Maddie explained how she was high n basically tje same thing she told me. She said that she wanted to talk to Hailey as well but when asked if she would talk to me, Hailey refused to and said she wouldn‚Äôt bc I was self absorbed, problematic, and that at least they weren‚Äôt as self absorbed like I was. I tried to send her an apology due to the fact I felt like I was being judgy when I confronted her instead of understanding her but she chose not to read it. I expressed to Gianna that it wasn‚Äôt that I didn‚Äôt care about the situation, is was that I couldn‚Äôt do anything if she blocked me on everything. I had tried to apologize for everything Maddie was mad at me for or stating I was and she just wasn‚Äôt hearing it so I don‚Äôt know what to do.i did end up apologizing through Gianna but Maddie didn‚Äôt wanna hear it. 

My main issue with the problem is that I wanted to know if I should‚Äôve reacted differently, and was I the asshole for reacting the way I did?

AITA? Should I have reacted differently in the situation in the first place? What should I do now? ",1.0,0.9864128232002258,1,1
79,1ecpl0b,AITA My husband wants me to be more supportive in his recovery.,"My husband and I have been married for 7 years. His drinking was never a problem when we were dating, after we married this revved up due to mental health issues and we've been on this ride ever since.

In the first year, I wasn‚Äôt mad. I was confused and life was chaos. I didn‚Äôt know what was happening. He would binge drink in the middle of the day. I never saw it, just a passed out guy on the sofa wasting away.

In the first 2 years, he lost one job, got an OUI, missed our first anniversary away. He entered his first outpatient substance program.  I supported him through court, worked two jobs and provided health insurance. We got into individual therapy and couples therapy.

Years 3-5 were better. I was at least living with someone who admitted he had a problem. We were in a cycle of binge drinking once every 3 months. He didn‚Äôt drink often, but when he did it was a secret pint of vodka alone within 20 mins. I rarely found the evidence. COVID happened and honestly it was one of the better parts of our marriage. I was pregnant with our first child due in June of 2020 and the lockdown forced my husband to lean on his crutch of alcohol.

The week I had my son, I lost my grandfather. I didn't get to say goodbye. My husband relapsed within the first 3 days of having my son home and the same day as my grandfathers wake. I spent one of the first nights with my baby alone.The next day I had to pretend it didn‚Äôt happen for the sake of my own family's grieving. It was incredibly isolating.

We fell back into the 3 month cycle again. When my son was 2, I packed up the kid, the cat and a bunch of clothes and moved back home. My husband went on a week long bender and landed himself in rehab April of 2022. A month later he came back and I moved back home.  Things were good for months, then I got pregnant again. We had to find a larger place to live and we bought a house. We closed the week of Christmas. I almost don‚Äôt blame my husband for relapsing then. He had two more smaller relapses in February 2023, then maintained sobriety for over a year.

He relapsed again in March 2024. Since then, he has gone to a crisis center, the ER twice, attended an anxiety IOP, got a sponsor, attends AA daily, started a 3 week trauma program. Last week during the internet outage,  the trauma program was cancelled for obvious reasons. My husband kept mentioning that it was so weird no one followed up to his emails, calls or to their initial email saying there would likely be no program today. It affected people on a global scale and he took it personally. I brought it up several times, but he said nothing was wrong. He drank that night.

Years of love, encouragement and support feel wasted. I feel foolish for trying this long, but I want him to succeed. We still live in the house together with our kids, cats, have shared accounts, but my attitude and outlook are poor.

This past month was my birthday. I had invited a friend for a visit and a weekend in a beach town about an hour away from my beach town. We were driving to our hotel when my brother called and hung up because he didn‚Äôt like my friend. I sent him a few texts to ask what was up and he asked if I would drive mom to the city the following weekend but did not say why. I asked why, what was going on, and he didn‚Äôt answer. I said I would drive my mother anyway but started messaging to figure out if my mom even wanted to go because she had not mentioned going to the city that weekend.

I eventually get a call from my brother, and he says that he, Paula, and mom are going to Europe in two weeks and will be seeing Taylor Swift. I ask if that‚Äôs what he wanted me to drive down for. He says yes. I am upset at this point because I am now realizing I am being excluded from a trip to Europe that he and my father had been planning for my mom without including me.

I text my brother and say not to bother talking to Paula about going on the trip. I text to Paula saying I feel bad about feeling left out and frustrated about my brother‚Äôs actions. She ended up apologizing but hasn‚Äôt spoken to me since.

81,1ecphti,AITA for hiding my identity from my childhood bully?,"This all started about a year ago. I (m18, but 17 at the beginning of this) started college. We had to fill out a form to see who we would be matched with for dormmates. I guess they put the people with the same living situations together. (I phrased that so badly.) When I met my dorm mate for the first time, I realized pretty quickly that he (m18, also 17 at the time) was my childhood bully. For context: I grew up fat and gay. I was a victim of childhood obesity. I was constantly mocked and bullied by a boy in my grade. It got so bad to a point where I became homeschooled after a year of the torment. Anyways, when I arrived to the dorm, he introduced himself to me, and I realized he didn‚Äôt remember me (or at least recognize me.) I decided that I wanted to see how long I could go without him finding out about our past. Since my childhood, I had thinned out a lot (I‚Äôm still chubby, but nowhere NEAR how I was during my childhood), and obviously my face matured a lot. We started to become friends overtime, but I still had a little bit of resentment for him since he made my childhood a living hell. Eventually though, that resentment went away. I really enjoy spending time with him. Time skip to now, and I finally came clean to him, and told him about our past, and he got really upset at me. He told me that I should‚Äôve told him sooner, and that I‚Äôm an asshole for keeping that hidden for the past year.

82,1ecpdtd,WIBTA if i defend my friend and his gf,"ATTEMPT 3

I (16M) have a couple of close friends in a really tight knit group of 8 people. My friend ""Simon"" (not real name) has a gf, ""Sam"" in our friend group as well. Our group doesn't really mind them dating even though ""Sam"" has had some rocky dating with someone who was once in our group before.

There is a guy ""Dogbreath"" (not real name) who is also in our group, he never seemed to like relationships in our group but was never directly vocal about it. I never really liked Dogbreath and i was on pretty good terms with both Simon and his gf, Sam so this could be just my innate bias showing.

Last night, after most people got off for the night, Dogbreath and Sam got in a really petty argument over a small thing. Sam was working on a specific thing she needed for a hobby she liked, and during conversation, she slipped in that it took her a whole day. Dogbreath took notice and said ""the thing was easy, how did it take you a whole day?"" Sam replied, ""Maybe stfu."" It should be noted that Sam really enjoys this specific hobby of hers.

Dogbreath instantly went on a rant about how it was a joke and how Sam had gotten soft since dating. This went on for a bit until Simon stepped in as a defense for Sam. Simon said that what he said was a bit of a dick move considering that Sam really cares for this hobby of hers. Dogbreath then goes on a 4 hour long rant about how dating is stupid and how Simon has changed. Simon pointed out that he isn't even trying to apologize or even admit he was wrong.

It gets to the point where, as we are all teenagers, we spread into racist and sexist shit. It eventually boils to where both Sam and Simon leave our group session and Dogbreath still spouting his mouth to the rest of us about how he was in the right and how dating makes you soft as a person.

Here is where I think i would be the asshole. I really want to talk to Dogbreath and completely tear a new one off him. Dogbreath has a history of starting arguments and not finishing them, relying on other people to sweep it under the rug as a joke. Think of Jack Doherty hiding behind his security as a good visual of this. I think that i might make things even worse because this was all over such a small and petty sentence and i dont want that. These people have been some of my closest friends for close to 3 years now.

Here are some things to know about Dogbreath:

1, Dogbreath has started many fights before, not just with Simon and Sam, but with most of the people both in and outside of our friend group.

2, while he was not responsible for Sam and her previous bf breakup, Dogbreath was directly responsible for the fight that eventually led to Sam's EX leaving the group for good.

88,1ecncje,AITA for deciding to leave my cousin's wedding a few hours early?,"My cousin and I have been super close our entire lives. She ended up becoming best friends with someone (I'll call her Emily) I knew long before she met and never clicked with (didn't trust her, didn't like her, didn't want to be around her), which is fine. People can be friends with whoever they want to be friends with whether I like that person or not. However, it became a huge issue when my cousin told Emily extremely personal information about me during one of the worst times of my life. 

Emily ended up telling a bunch of our mutuals the private details of my life that I didn't want to share with anyone. I was devastated and felt so betrayed that my cousin would be the one to abuse my trust like that. We didn't speak for an entire year. Once I was ready to repair my relationship with my cousin, I decided that I would never be in the same room as Emily again. My cousin and Emily had a falling out because of this too but became friends again years later. Surprise, Emily screwed her over again, and they fell out again. They haven't spoken for about three years. 

My cousin got engaged about two months ago and is getting married in October. She mentioned to me that she was thinking about inviting Emily. I told her that it's her wedding and she can invite whoever she wants to, but I also reminded her about how strongly I felt about Emily and that I meant it when I said I would never be in the same room as her again. 

Well, Emily got invited and I just found out two days ago. She RSVP'd 2-3 weeks ago and my family kept it a secret from me so my cousin could ""tell me on her own when it fit into her itinerary."" Which, fine, she's planning a wedding and maybe uncomfortable conversations aren't on the top of her list of things to do, but I still found out. Again, she can invite whoever she wants to her wedding, but I set a very clear and very strict boundary about Emily. 

I decided that I'm going to compromise, go to the wedding, celebrate my cousin for a while, but leave a couple hours early so I don't have to spend any more time than I'm obligated to in the same room as Emily (small wedding, small venue). My cousin is livid about my decision, sent me scathing and insulting text messages, then blocked me on every platform. I don't even know if I'm still invited to the wedding at this point. 

I don't think leaving early is a big deal and I think my decision is a fair compromise for both of us. I'm willing to bend, but I'm not willing to break. I really have no ill will towards Emily. I'm over the situation, and I hope she lives a happy and fulfilling life, but she is the reminder of all of those feelings of betrayal and hurt, and this entire situation brings up new feelings of betrayal and hurt, and I really don't think I should have to throw the boundary I created with her completely out the window.

Ex got pregnant **after**¬†breakup. (21f/22m)  
Our relationship is toast. We abandoned ship.  
She ""always wanted a baby"" at a young age. (her family has a history of that) we agreed 27 but whatever.  
Our relationship was good at first but soon was the rocky mountains. 2 abortions didn't help. Constant scrutiny  
She said last time would be the last time. I said okay.  
Bam! Again. Damn fertility window. Plan B said not today.

Your choice, but still doesn't mean I want this baby, I'm sorry.  
(we're not ready for sure)  
How am I gonna deal with the post abortion depression? I'm sad you don't want a baby with me.  
Fine I'll pay for your breasts you've been wanting. $6k (yikes)

Months later. I've saved up a little under what I need to pay it and I don't want to evaporate 6 months of saving my hard earned income. My rent just went up $300, I have a business now, no degree etc.

I'm thinking of just saying F it, as wrong as it is. I rather pay for a doctor visit, a physical therapist, and pour some life into me before I go back to square 1. I struggled hard enough to get here.  
It won't ruin me but...the deal was so wrong to begin with.

My family doesn't know but presumably I will have to tell them because they will likely hear of it anyway; it'll get some weight off my chest though. Her family will probably hate me though. It'll be embarrassing for awhile.

But then he moved in with his wife and her kids. My dad focused only on them once we all moved in together. He was always with them, never with me. He focused too much on them. I tried talking to him but he was never ready to listen. Until last year. We sat down and talked.

He'd been talking about why he was paying more attention to them and why it was important to him and how he wanted us to be close to (me and the kids) and then he talked about how he knew from the moment he met them that they were meant to be his kids and he was meant to be their dad. But he always told me that becoming a dad to me had come with a lot and he wasn't always sure of me and stuff like that. How it took time. He said it wasn't ever natural or instinctual with me at the start but he was making it clear it was with them. I told him that fucking hurt and made me realize I wanted nothing to do with those kids. He twisted himself in knots over it and we set up a day for us to have some 1:1 time. Just us. An entire day. Like he did with them.

Then his stepson ended up in the hospital, so it couldn't happen. Dad apologized a hundred times and promised it would happen soon. But then his wife's relative died and she was going out of state to the funeral so of course he couldn't leave the kids and take me for a day while she was gone. And then he took a day off work while I had a day off school and we were just about to go when his stepdaughter's school called for an urgent meeting. Dad's wife was going but dad told me he had to be there too. 

I told him to forget it. I was done. No more chances. He was clearly going to put them first and I was going to accept it and spend the next two years distant with all of them and preparing myself to move out and be independent. Dad tried to convince me to change my mind. But I did not. He tried to spring it on me unplanned and I had plans, I told him that, and I told him he was useless to me. He waited until my plans were over and picked me up because it was raining. I was going to walk. He insisted he wanted just me and him for a few. But of course his stepdaughter needed to be picked up and I laughed and told him even a car ride was too much and it's why I was done.

93,1ecmw21,AITA for renegotiating a verbal deal to buy my brother in-laws kitchen?,"My wife and I, along with our two young kids, were looking for an apartment to rent early this year since our current lease wouldn‚Äôt be renewed past the end of June. Finding an apartment in our city is extremely challenging, but luckily, we found my wife‚Äôs brother Peter‚Äôs apartment available for rent starting July 1st. 

Peter agreed to recommend us to his landlord but wanted us to buy his kitchen and appliances for 5000‚Ç¨ before doing so. This kind of arrangement isn‚Äôt technically legal but not uncommon either. We agreed, thinking it was worth it to secure the apartment, avoid double rent, and help out family.

In May, we visited Peter and he informed us that their move-out date might be delayed. He said they might need the apartment for an extra 2 weeks to 2 months. Despite asking for a precise date to arrange alternative accommodation, he couldn‚Äôt give us one. They had a new lease starting September 1st but hoped to move earlier. 

By late June, Peter indicated they might need the apartment even longer, essentially asking us to take over the rent whenever they moved out to avoid paying double rent. My wife was furious, pointing out that Peter was making his problem our problem. 

Then, the landlord offered us a rental contract starting August 1st, so we arranged temporary accommodation for July, including a 500‚Ç¨ stay in a hotel and the rest in an unfurnished apartment. Peter later confirmed they‚Äôd move out between mid-July and August 1st. We insisted that if there was any overlap, they‚Äôd cover our temporary rent, which he agreed to since it was cheaper than his current rent.

In early July, Peter said we could move our belongings (just 10 boxes and two kids‚Äô beds) into the apartment on July 30th, the last day of our temporary rental. He is getting the keys to his new place on the 27th, but moving his stuff on the 31st. However, he then told us there wasn‚Äôt enough room in their apartment and suggested storing our things in the attic (5th floor) instead of the apartment (1st floor), making it much harder for us.

I was extremely upset. We had been very accommodating, but Peter‚Äôs actions felt inconsiderate. My wife was also angry. We haven‚Äôt finalized the kitchen purchase and are now considering renegotiating the deal. The original agreement was just verbal and not legally binding.

94,1ecmmsl,AITA for not buying my wife a plane ticket so she is missing the family vacation ,"
My wife is horrible with money, at the beginning of our marriage we pulled out money together and she would use all of it. Her job is pays shit compared to mine. So when we combined the money she went crazy. I had many conversations with her over it and even tried to get her to take a money finical class.

Overtime it got worse and worse. About a year ago I learned she was in bad credit card debt. I gave her he chose of divorce or we separate our money and she needs to fix her debt ASAP.

To her credit she took it seriously and she is fixing her credit card debt. We have separate money and I pay for the bills while her only worry is to buy groceries. 

My family has a big vacation coming up and everyone is invited. The trip is to Europe and plane tickets are going to cost 1000+. My parents are going to pay for the resort so the only think needs to be paid is the plane ticket and fun money for the trip.

I plan on going. She informed me that she will not be  able to afford the ticket. I point out the trip is in about four month so she should be able to save up. She informed me that she needs to use it for her credit card debt in order to get I paid off. I told her ok and I‚Äôll inform the my family side that she can‚Äôt make it.

This started an argument that I am not willing to pay for her ticket and me going on vacation without her. I told her this is her own fault and if she was responsible with money we would be here

95,1ecmegn,AITA? My girlfriend had to force my best friend to keep in touch with me,"I (15M) have been with my girlfriend (15F) for almost two years. Even though our relationship has been amazing, I‚Äôve really struggled with fitting in at school and making friends due to me being a bit ‚Äònerdy‚Äô and having weird interests (I really like jazz music and jazz theory). I used to have a very close friend, but she moved away at the start of the year, leaving me pretty much alone. My school is also mostly girls, so there aren‚Äôt very many other guys my age to be friends with. I‚Äôve had a few experiences with being bullied or kicked out of friend groups and it‚Äôs led to me being pretty introverted and staying off most social media. 

So a few months ago, I finally started making friends. I got especially close with one guy in my year (15M). We hit it off well and since we were in many of the same classes, we became friends pretty quickly. He was dating one of my girlfriends‚Äôs friends at the time, so the four of us would go on double dates together. Right before school broke up for the summer, him and his girlfriend went through a pretty rough breakup and I was there to support him through it. After school ended, I invited him over and we spent the day together. I ended up opening up to him about how I have a pretty bad fear of rejection, especially when it comes to texting people, and that I would really like for him to text me over the summer as we‚Äôd both be going away. He was going to have some conversation with his ex and I also asked him to update me about that (I can give pretty good advice). I‚Äôve lost contact with many friends over the summer before and I told him I didn‚Äôt want this to happen with him. He was really understanding and told me he‚Äôd text me.

So I‚Äôm now pretty deep into the summer and I haven‚Äôt heard from him once. I told my girlfriend I was angry about this and she told me that I should text him. I refused because I hate texting people first and thought it would be a bit desperate after what I saw as him clearly ignoring me. The next day (which was today) I got a text from him asking how my summer was going. I told my girlfriend and asked her if she had something to do with it. She denied it, saying she had asked him how things were with his ex and he‚Äôd independently brought me up. I asked her to send a screenshot, and she admitted that she had been lying. She had asked him to text me and said that I was ‚Äòwondering why‚Äô he hadn‚Äôt texted me yet. She caved in and sent the screenshots. 

Now I‚Äôm not mad that she asked him to talk to me, but I am angry that she lied. I‚Äôm also pretty pissed off at my friend for this, so I replied sarcastically with something like ‚Äòhow sweet of you to text me after my girlfriend made you‚Äô. I‚Äôm not really sure if I‚Äôm justifiably angry or if I‚Äôm subconsciously trying to sabotage another friendship. I don‚Äôt know if I was being petty by not texting my friend first, but I did ask him to text me. I‚Äôve been ignoring my girlfriend after telling her I‚Äôm angry that she lied.

Anyways, my dad just recently got remarried in April without us even knowing ( we didn‚Äôt even attend the wedding ). He just entered the house one day and a girl was with him. He introduced her as his wife. I was pretty pissed off especially that exam season was just on the horizon. I tried to fake a smile and greeted me, but then later on I figured out her age.. let‚Äôs just say it is was inappropriate .. the age gap was too big and she was way closer to my age than his. I am a 17(F) and I just felt disgusted and yelled at my father when I knew ( I know yelling at him was a mistake but I was just too angry). 

I immediately packed my books and went to my mom‚Äôs place without his permission. Stayed there for two months and refused to speak to him. I only contacted him once or twice and in either case I was in tears. He said that I am ruining his family and that my siblings weren‚Äôt as dramatic. That I am rebellious and that he failed to raise me and much more. Well, one of my sisters was 8 and the other was diagnosed with ADHD .. so I felt that that was the reason they weren‚Äôt able to make a stand. I even later talked with them 1 to 1 and they said they know it‚Äôs wrong but what can we do now, she is legally his wife .

Now that exam session has ended I‚Äôm spending  half of the vacation at my dad‚Äôs place. He wants me to interact with her and act like nothing happened. I stopped hanging out with my family especially with her. I made it clear many times how disgusted and embarrassed I am.

In simple words ,he wanted her because she was young, beautiful, and willing to be a housewife.

99,1eclpr0,AITA for renegotiating a deal with my step-brother?,"My wife and I have two young kids and we were looking for an apartment to rent at the start of the year as our current apartment would not be renewed past the end of June. At the moment, it is really difficult to find an apartment in the city where we live, but amazingly we found the apartment of my wife‚Äòs brother, available for rent July 1st. We spoke to him and he said they would recommend us to the landlord but they were also selling the kitchen and appliances, and that they wanted the new tenant to agree to purchase it before they would recommend them. This is technically not legal, but it‚Äôs not uncommon. We agreed and were happy to be done with the apartment hunting. They wanted 5000‚Ç¨ for the kitchen, which is what they paid when they moved in a few years ago. This is much more than what we would pay normally but decided it was worth it to guarantee the place for us, we wouldn‚Äôt have to pay double rent for a month as the move in date was perfect, and it‚Äôs for family.

A few weeks later (in May), we visited my brother in law to see him and the apartment. He told us that the date had changed and they would need the apartment for longer. We asked him how much longer they would need and he said between 2 weeks and 2 months. We asked him exactly how long so we could organise some other accommodation and he couldn‚Äôt tell us. Apparently they had signed their new apartment for September 1st, but were told by the landlord that they might be able to move in July 1st. That was why they had advertised the apartment for that date. We left it there but later in June, he told us they might need it even longer. He was hoping that we could just move in whenever they move out and take over the rent so they wouldn‚Äôt have to pay double rent.

My wife was mad at this and told him that he is making his problem our problem. At this time, the landlord of the apartment contacted us and told us we can sign the rental contract starting August 1st, and we organised some accommodation for July, including four nights in a hotel for 500‚Ç¨ and the rest in a nearby unfurnished apartment. Later, my brother in law contacted us and told us they would like to move out sometime between mid-July to August 1st, and we said that‚Äôs fine, but they would have to cover the rent for our temporary apartment if there was any overlap, because we needed a place to stay and he was being inflexible. He accepted this as the intermediate rent was cheaper than his current apartment.

Now it‚Äôs late July and we are ready for the move. Earlier in the month my brother in law said we could move our stuff (we don‚Äôt have much stuff - 10 boxes and two kids beds) into the apartment on the 30th which is the last day of our intermediate rental. He is also getting the keys to their new apartment on this date, but their stuff is being moved on the 31st as it is cheaper. We were happy with this arrangement but this morning, he told us there is not enough room in their apartment for us to move our stuff there. He said we should put it in the attic (5th floor) and then just move it down in the day we move in (1st floor).

I just about blew my top at this. I feel like we have been very accommodating during this whole ordeal and he has been an asshole. My wife is also very angry. We haven‚Äôt discussed the kitchen but are considering renegotiating the deal. It was just a verbal agreement at the start of the process, and not technically legal. My wife said she will ask for all the receipts and we can look up the current market price before making the offer. I would prefer asking them to remove the kitchen entirely and we would sort ourselves something from ikea.

So, are we being assholes for thinking of renegotiating the kitchen?",TL;DR,2024-07-26,"AITA for renegotiating a deal with my step-brother? My wife and I have two young kids and we were looking for an apartment to rent at the start of the year as our current apartment would not be renewed past the end of June. At the moment, it is really difficult to find an apartment in the city where we live, but amazingly we found the apartment of my wife‚Äòs brother, available for rent July 1st. We spoke to him and he said they would recommend us to the landlord but they were also selling the kitchen and appliances, and that they wanted the new tenant to agree to purchase it before they would recommend them. This is technically not legal, but it‚Äôs not uncommon. We agreed and were happy to be done with the apartment hunting. They wanted 5000‚Ç¨ for the kitchen, which is what they paid when they moved in a few years ago. This is much more than what we would pay normally but decided it was worth it to guarantee the place for us, we wouldn‚Äôt have to pay double rent for a month as the move in date was perfect, and it‚Äôs for family.

A few weeks later (in May), we visited my brother in law to see him and the apartment. He told us that the date had changed and they would need the apartment for longer. We asked him how much longer they would need and he said between 2 weeks and 2 months. We asked him exactly how long so we could organise some other accommodation and he couldn‚Äôt tell us. Apparently they had signed their new apartment for September 1st, but were told by the landlord that they might be able to move in July 1st. That was why they had advertised the apartment for that date. We left it there but later in June, he told us they might need it even longer. He was hoping that we could just move in whenever they move out and take over the rent so they wouldn‚Äôt have to pay double rent.

100,1eckwhe,AITA for telling a large girl we don‚Äôt fit in the passenger seat,"For context, I‚Äôm Filipino and male 21 from the motherland. Here we have Jeepneys we use for our daily commute.

At this specific event, Im seated in front, to the right of the driver. The front fits 3 people including the driver, while the back fits 16, 8 each side.

15 minutes into the trip a large girl (approx in her 30s) gestured to the driver to stop, indicating that she would board the jeepney.

Now I‚Äôm no big dude, I‚Äôm 70Kg at most and 5‚Äô10. When she sat next to me. Literally, my right ass cheek is barely sitting on the hard ass seat while my left ass cheek is dangling on nothing. To add insult to injury, my balls is resting on the seatbelt buckle

She then had the audacity to tell me to move further so she can sit in a commanding way

That paired with the nonstop 2nd hand smoke coming from the drivers cigarette and the 9 hour internship I just did made me reply to her with

‚ÄúWala na akong maupuan, Hindi tayo kasya dito‚Äù

Which translates to

‚ÄúI have nowhere else to move/sit, we dont fit here‚Äù

She then began crying and calling me fatphobic

As for my tone, try to imagine if you were tired, in pain, uncomfortable, hot, and keeps on coughing then an entitled woman commands me to move (Im definitely mad)

AITA?

EDIT:

Just to add some details I missed

1. The jeepney Im in and others as well were indeed very full. Its the rush hour. It just so happened the guy who sat next to me got off a few meters before the woman gestured the jeep to stop. So there is 1 free seat in the jeep the moment the woman was about to board

2. From left to right, the front consists of the driver, the stick shift, me, then the woman. So I‚Äôm in the middle. Plus unlike in cars there is no cupholder or anything I could rest my left butt on. Its just a straight drop to the floor from the edge of the seat

3. I saw a comment here about clapping, i don‚Äôt really understand, but if it meant that I was apploaded by the other passengers, then no, its 6pm, everyones too tired to care. Plus I dont think they heard what we said. 

4. Yes the driver couldve prevented her from boarding, but its their livelihood, the more passengers the more income they have.

5. I endured about 20minutes in that position, I held onto a handle in the front dashboard and the drivers seat to help balance myself. I only have a sling bag so my stuff is secure. Then she got off. Another 40 minutes later, I got off.

6. Yes I couldve just got off. But either I waste 40 minutes of my time waiting for another jeepney, not to mention the time it would take to travel to where Im currently at to my house (40 minutes) plus the fare I would have to pay again OR I just suck it up.

7. She didn‚Äôt really cuss me out, instead, she went like (i forgot her exact words), ‚Äúhow dare you body shame me‚Äù in a crying tone and proceeded to sniff and wipe her eyes with her hanky. Then it was silence for us.

8. For the ‚Äúcommanding way‚Äù, I meant she told me to move in a grouchy/grumpy/karen-y/so-tired-that-Idgaf tone (I apologize, my english doesnt compare to native speakers). Plus, I forgot her exact words but what she said was something along the lines of ‚ÄúTumabi ka pa nga‚Äù 

Tumabi ka ‚Äî move aside
Pa - more
Nga - (idk what it really means since I use it to emphasize different expressions, but in this case it sets the sentence in a demanding manner especially with the way she said it

9. She wasnt exactly morbidly obese, but she could occupy the entire front passenger seat (which fits two). 

10. This occured at the southermost city (Muntinlupa) of the province where Manila is situated if some are wondering.

102,1eck6sl,AITA for refusing to engage in discussions about my care for my mother's youngest child with my maternal grandparents?,"The background might be confusing but I'll try to make it simple. Seven years ago my mother left my family (dad, me, two brothers and younger sister) for months. It was sudden, unexplained for like 3 months and my dad was really worried something had happened to her. But she told him she had found someone else she wanted to be with. Dad only spoke to her once during those months and that was when he found this out. Following that was nothing. Until almost a year later, maybe 10 months after she first up and went, she came back and told him she wanted us to be a family again and she regretted leaving him. Dad refused to take her back. Mom then went MIA for another 2 months. Then she came back and told us she'd originally left because she got pregnant with someone else's child and hadn't wanted us to know. But once she realized dad wouldn't take her back regardless, she decided to take her kid back off whoever and told us all about him.

My parents divorce was messy. Dad had to do a DNA on the kid, who isn't his son, and he also had to legally sever his parental responsibility because he and mom were married, which made him the defacto father and mom tried to put him on the birth certificate. But she had him under her maiden name so it was a mess. But dad severed any rights or responsibilities and he never interacted with mom's son or agreed to be responsible for him.

I'm now 20f and my siblings are 17m, 15m and 14f. We did not have a relationship with our mother after she left our family. We do not have a relationship with her youngest and we only saw him once, very briefly, when he was a baby.

My mom left again, leaving her youngest behind. His father is unknown. DNA didn't find him. My maternal grandparents were denied the opportunity to take him and my dad was asked if he would, and he said no, then I was asked, and I said no, so he went to a foster family. This happened 4 months ago. My maternal grandparents decided to ask my dad to raise their grandson as his son and raise him as our sibling. But my dad put my foot down and said no.

After he put his foot down they turned to me and told me I could do it, with their financial help. They gave me the sob story of he's innocent, he's so young, he doesn't have anyone else, he's miserable in foster care, and that he should know us all and have a relationship with us. I said no. I told them I do not care. He is not my responsibility and I feel nothing for him. After this they asked me to sit down and discuss care options for him. I said no. I told them it has nothing to do with me. They argued that it does, they argued that he's my brother whether I want him to be or not. I told them I do not care and he can stay in foster care because I won't raise him. They tried shaming me for my coldness and I brushed it off. They also shamed me for not seeking any visits with him so he can get to know me. They said it would be a good influence on my younger siblings, who also want nothing to do with him.

This is in 2018. I lived with 7 other housemates. 5 of us moved into an apartment where 2 of them already lived for some time. We purchased our own groceries but didn't have designated shelves, it was just stored in the kitchen wherever it fit. But we never had issues with food theft, thankfully.

At some point, the pantry/counter was getting full to the point we were starting to store overflow in our rooms. Some housemates started commenting on it. I volunteered to toss out whatever was expired to make space. This was agreed upon by everyone in the group chat. I spent a day going through the pantry and found a surprising amount of expired food, not just months-old, but things like packets that expired in 2007 and a whole case of pasta roni from 2001. I left some cans that were expired, kept some expired things from the past year that looked and smelled okay, but trashed the really old stuff that had been there for a long time (in the  back, some had been there since we moved in). Our pantry space nearly doubled.

Days later, one of the 2 housemates that had lived there longer realized that their food was gone and asked why I threw the older items out. I told them it was part of the expired food cleanup.

105,1ecjohy,AITA to not let my husband bring his mom to work?,"my husband (30m) works as a lecturer in local university. sometimes he has classes in another city (approx 1 hour away), and whenever he does, he always bring his mom (60ish). his mom waits in the car and after his class ends, they go shopping to nearby mall or eat at restaurant.

I said to him and his mom, he shouldn't do that because he looks unprofessional if his collague or student know that. he can go out with her on weekend or any other time.

while on the other hand, his mom is a widow and really enjoy quality time with my husband.

AITA ?

ETA : 
1. MIL can accompany him on weekend or any other time. I just thought why doesn't she join him AFTER his class instead of waiting the whole time.

2. some comments remind me that he always reschedule or changes it to online class whenever his mom can't accompany him. maybe thats why I thought it was weird. 

He said the student never complain because they prefer online class anyway.thats why I forgot to include it in the OG post 

ETA 2 :
I know from my post I am an asshole and weirdo for asking, I clearly have no idea about academia, and it has nothing to do with me. I just thought it was weird because in my logic I compare it as I bring my parent to my cubicle/workdesk, and you guys saying that's not the case and I understand.

but those who said I am a jealous bitch to my MIL, immature, and controlling, jeezz it's not like I never let my husband met my MIL on weekend or dinner. And we just got home from her house today eating dinner so no argument or anything


",Asshole,2024-07-26,"AITA to not let my husband bring his mom to work? my husband (30m) works as a lecturer in local university. sometimes he has classes in another city (approx 1 hour away), and whenever he does, he always bring his mom (60ish). his mom waits in the car and after his class ends, they go shopping to nearby mall or eat at restaurant.

I said to him and his mom, he shouldn't do that because he looks unprofessional if his collague or student know that. he can go out with her on weekend or any other time.

while on the other hand, his mom is a widow and really enjoy quality time with my husband.

AITA ?

ETA : 
1. MIL can accompany him on weekend or any other time. I just thought why doesn't she join him AFTER his class instead of waiting the whole time.

2. some comments remind me that he always reschedule or changes it to online class whenever his mom can't accompany him. maybe thats why I thought it was weird. 

He said the student never complain because they prefer online class anyway.thats why I forgot to include it in the OG post

In 2010, I and husband adopted Sam. He comes from a family that have been practicing consanguine and incestuous marriage (marriage between siblings, cousins and close related family members),¬†for many generations. His bio mom didn't do the best during her pregnancy with Sam (she drinks alcohol, smokes cigarette and using drugs). She also tried to abort him multiple times. Sam survived but have to deals with the consequences, which is tons of health issues, both congenital and acquired.

I and my cousin, Vivi are really close, because our moms are twins. We spent our childhood together and we were living in the same house for several years. But since she got married and moved to S.Korea, we only talk every once in awhile.

Vivi's daughter, Val, was diagnosed with Leukemia when she was 9, 7 years ago. She went into remission, but relapsed.

Vivi knows about Sam's health issues, but since Val's Cancer diagnosis in 2017, every time we talk about our kids health struggles, she'll always saying things like ""I'm grateful that he doesn't have Cancer"", ""It's a great thing that he doesn't have to go through chemo"", ""You know, they're (Sam's diagnoses) better than Cancer"", ""You'll never know how painful it is to deal with Cancer"", ""Even tho Val never had any surgery, but she's dealing with Cancer, it's worse"", and etc.

I tried to tell Vivi that, ""I'm grateful Sam doesn't have Cancer, I'm so sorry for what you're going through. But please know that Sam is also struggle with his health, he also experience constant pain and also have to go through many procedures. He's disabled, and I will appreciate if we support each other without comparing between the two."" But she continues to do the same.

Vivi contacted me early in the morning and told me that Val is sick with influenza B. And started her attitude again with saying ""I'm glad that Sam doesn't have Cancer, so he wouldn't know how a common virus could be life-threatening with Cancer.""

I told her, ""You know it isn't true. You know he is immunodeficient and you know what it means. And you don't have to be 'glad', Val isn't the only one who's suffering here.""

She called me an AH for saying such a thing and there are not a single one of Sam's diagnoses could be compare to Cancer.

(When Sam was younger, he went through a few rounds of chemotherapy to treat another condition, he's also on antibody and immunoglobulin therapy, and some other regular infusions and bunch of medications. I know those probably aren't comparable to Cancer and chemo is poison, but they are not side-effects-free.)

I reached my limit of 3000 words. I'll answer any questions. If I'm the AH, I will openly apologize to Vivi.

I (24 m) have a boyfriend (25 m) we are both from different backgrounds and states, we met each other through social media, during pandemic in 2021 and since then i moved to his parents house and been living there, im not going to lie i don‚Äôt have to pay for anything only for what i want to buy and the same goes to him (mainly because i just got a job as a teacher since October of last year).

Recently his dad has been throwing hints for us to start paying for stuff like the electric bill, which im not opposed to, but he hasn‚Äôt talked to me or my bf about actually paying for anything but this has caused my bf to take it as a ‚Äúyou have to start living on your own‚Äù and he wants us to go to a house his parents own like literally next week he just told me today, and we have nothing to go live on our own, not a fridge, a stove, or even a microwave.

So he wanted me to tell my parents to buy us things, only to start living there as soon as possible, the thing is my parents are not in a situation to spend a lot of money and even if they did i personally don‚Äôt think is their responsibility to pay for our stuff, he is defending himself saying that his parents have given us the house and the things of our room (bed, tv, a mirror, AC) and he thinks that my parents wouldn‚Äôt mind paying for something as little as a fridge because i‚Äôve been living for free at their home, i told him that if he wanted we can wait until i go back to work so i can take a credit and buy those things we are missing but he wants to live there asap because he doesn‚Äôt want anyone else living in that house.

Now he is debating if whether living together alone is a good idea or just end things, and tomorrow ill try to talk to my parents about buying us the fridge.

3. also I didn‚Äôt save money because I didn‚Äôt know he was even planning to move anywhere he literally told me yesterday 
4.  I didn‚Äôt came to my parents house to ‚Äúhide‚Äù i came to visit because I haven‚Äôt seen them since February 
5.  Im not ending my relationship because im asking my FILS for a fridge, he wants me to ask mine for one

108,1ecivmd,AITA for Asking for Money from my Moms Boyfriend,"My father died a couple of years ago, and after she moved out of their home, sold it, bought a trailer, and settled back in a different town to be closer to my brother and his children, I encouraged my mom to date.

My mom has been dating a fellow for about a year. I do not know my moms bf personally. What I do know, after many many conversations with my mother, is that he is a multimillionaire who is incredibly generous and gives openly to other people literally all of the time. Like, pays for peoples house remodels no strings attached kinda generous. Me and my mom are close so she shares a lot with me. 

I don't ask for money often, but for the past few months I cannot afford my rent, the therapy I need for my mental health, about half of my medications, and I am relying constantly on the good will of others for food. I own a cat and a dog and buy their food before mine if I have the money. Due to specific circumstances out of my control, I cannot work for about 3 or 4 months. I am working with a attorney to solve this.

So, I ask my mom; ""Hey, mom, I don't like asking this, but is it possible you can ask your bf to help me out a little. Like, no judgement if he says no, it's not his responsibly to care for me, but I would really appreciate you asking him.""

""No I can't do that.""

""Why not?""

""Because I think it's wrong to ask people for money and I have more pride then that.""

""Mom, I appreciate that maybe *you* wouldn't feel proud about it, but this isn't really about you, it is about me. You know how difficult I am struggling right now. I have personally had to ask for money every single day for the past two months just to make ends meet. I don't feel good about that. If I could work, I would. But I can't. Could you please reconsider.""

""No, I am absolutely not doing that. I think it is wrong to do that and I am not going to ask for money. I know how hard it is for you right now, and if I could help you I would, but I am not going to do that.""

""I am not saying for him to give me ten grand, mom. I am asking for, honestly¬†*anything*¬†he would be willing to give me, and once again, there is no issue if he says no. I understand it's uncomfortable, but not being able to eat consistently is pretty uncomfortable for me too.""

""No I will not do that. I am setting a boundary like¬†***you***¬†taught me (yes she actually said that), and I am saying this is a boundary. I refuse to do that. ""

Maybe I have a weird take on it, but if my child was starving and suffering, I would do *literally* anything to stop that from being the case. In fact, my mother has been quoted as saying ""I would do ANYTHING for my kids."" But apparently asking a non-committal, no strings attached question from a millionaire who has literally said to her ""If you ever need money just ask and I have your back, no questions"" that's her Meatloaf (rest in peace) moment.

109,1ecirrp,AITAH to take over the family house and refusing to pay other siblings?,"UPDATE: I forgot to mention, the agreement has a clause the mother will still have the legal rights to live in this house, and we will be her legal caretakers till her death. 

We lived as expats abroad where I met my husband , and a few years ago we decided to relocate to his home country in Europe. 

He has a mother and three other siblings. They had a family house where nobody lived for the last  2 years, prior to that one of his youngest siblings lived there rent free for 8 years. His mother lives with her partner now. So everyone has their own houses now. 

The house in question was the property of their father who passed away 10 years ago. They could not register heritage because the house and land accumulated a huge debt for not paying taxes for years, it was equal pretty much to the value of the house. 

Nobody was interested to pay and save this house, so upon the death of the mother the house would be just gone to auction. 

Now when we came , my husband with the lawyers found a way to reduce the debt by refusing the heritage. So all the siblings including my husband refused legally the heritage , their mother became a sole heir. Due to her being an old woman with low income , the debts were reduced to just the principal amount without the accumulated interest, and now the debts were about 20% of the market value of the house. 

Again my husband asked the siblings who wanted to share the cost of saving the house by paying the debts and registration fees. Nobody wanted or didn‚Äôt have money for it. So then we decided instead of buying a random house, we can pay the debts and renovate the family one. It needed complete renovation . 

The mother was over the moon that one of the children actually wants the house and it would not be gone to auction after her death. 
When we paid the debts and the lawyers, the mother signed the papers to handover the ownership of the house to us. 

Now when we renovated the house and it all looks nice and not falling apart any more, the family drama started as if we forced the mother to give the house to us for free. All siblings are asking us to pay them ‚Äútheir share‚Äù. We are at the breaking point of telling them , that if they want , they can first compensate us what we spent for paying debts and lawyers , and then we put the house on sale and walk away. Nope, they just want us to pay them. 

I guess they hoped we would pay the debts for the house to be registered under their mother‚Äôs name, and then everyone would receive heritage upon her death. All three siblings went NC with us, trash talking to the extended family how we robbed them.  we are still in contact with his mother but she is heartbroken that the family is broken  now, before we always had sweet family reunions. They all made her feeling guilty and accuse of favouritism.

111,1ecifyw,AITA for backing out of a trip with my friend because I didn‚Äôt want to be bothered with her kids? ,"For context, a few weeks ago I planned a girls trip to the beach with one of my best friends to relax since we both have been stressed out with work, school and life in general. We agreed on where we wanted to go andI went ahead and booked our hotel. Over the course of those few weeks, we discussed the trip and talked about what we were planning to do while we were there or whatever. The night before our trip, she calls me to go over some traveling details and during the conversation she randomly says, ‚Äú Oh I don‚Äôt think I told you but my kids are coming. I forgot to tell you‚Äù. She has three small children, one is on the spectrum so she requires more attention and care, which is totally understandable. I don‚Äôt have any kids yet, but of course I try to be empathetic to my friends and family who do have children and have to bring them along when plans change. The issue is that my friend did not tell me until that night before our trip, as many times that we have talked, that she was bringing her kids. I love her kids but the plan was to have a carefree weekend to ourselves and to do adults things in which we couldn‚Äôt do if she has to be responsible and keep a close eye on her kids the whole time, and more than likely I would be inclined to help because I don‚Äôt want to see her stressed.  After we talked I took a while to think if I really wanted to still go and I decided I didn‚Äôt want to.   The trip would essentially be a ‚Äúkids‚Äù trip because everything would revolve around them and that‚Äôs not what was planned. I called her back and told her that maybe we should reschedule but I presented it as if I wanted her to be stress free and actually have fun without worrying about her kids so I didnt sound too selfish. She seemed like she felt a way about it. But I felt a way she didn‚Äôt even tell me they were coming before then and when she finally did I felt like I couldn‚Äôt say no because it was last minute. And to be honest, I wanted to have fun with my friend, but I didn‚Äôt sign up to help babysit. Am I wrong for doing that ? 

Edit: Just wanted to add some extra info as I see a few of the same questions being asked and I wanted to clear up some things‚Ä¶

1. My friend‚Äôs ex is not in the picture anymore unfortunately, has been for some years. He has mental issues and was abusive, so no he doesn‚Äôt not keep the kids.

2. She does have parents and other family members and friends that have watched her kids before. She actually lives with her parents currently and has a decent support system. 

3. We did communicate with each other that it was a girls trip from the very beginning and no she did not communicate that her kids were coming at all. She also did not mention her parents or a sitter backing out at the last minute which is why she had to bring her kids.

4. I have extended her grace in other situations, however, she told me ahead of time that her kids would be present so I was mentally prepared and cool with helping her out as she knows I would help her. I know she has a lot on her plate so
I try to be understanding as much as possible especially because she is a single parent now. I never made her feel like she didn‚Äôt have my support or that she shouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable asking me for help. This was just not one of those situations that it was expected. We went on a trip last year and she didn‚Äôt bring the kids, her folks watched them for the weekend.

5. I didn‚Äôt ask her what she had planned on doing with kids while we were on the trip because as I stated before she stays with her parents and they usually watch them and if they are not available another family member does keep them.

For context, a few weeks ago I planned a girls trip to the beach with one of my best friends to relax since we both have been stressed out with work, school and life in general. We agreed on where we wanted to go andI went ahead and booked our hotel. Over the course of those few weeks, we discussed the trip and talked about what we were planning to do while we were there or whatever. The night before our trip, she calls me to go over some traveling details and during the conversation she randomly says, ‚Äú Oh I don‚Äôt think I told you but my kids are coming. I forgot to tell you‚Äù. She has three small children, one is on the spectrum so she requires more attention and care, which is totally understandable. I don‚Äôt have any kids yet, but of course I try to be empathetic to my friends and family who do have children and have to bring them along when plans change. The issue is that my friend did not tell me until that night before our trip, as many times that we have talked, that she was bringing her kids. I love her kids but the plan was to have a carefree weekend to ourselves and to do adults things in which we couldn‚Äôt do if she has to be responsible and keep a close eye on her kids the whole time, and more than likely I would be inclined to help because I don‚Äôt want to see her stressed.  After we talked I took a while to think if I really wanted to still go and I decided I didn‚Äôt want to.   The trip would essentially be a ‚Äúkids‚Äù trip because everything would revolve around them and that‚Äôs not what was planned. I called her back and told her that maybe we should reschedule but I presented it as if I wanted her to be stress free and actually have fun without worrying about her kids so I didnt sound too selfish. She seemed like she felt a way about it. But I felt a way she didn‚Äôt even tell me they were coming before then and when she finally did I felt like I couldn‚Äôt say no because it was last minute. And to be honest, I wanted to have fun with my friend, but I didn‚Äôt sign up to help babysit. Am I wrong for doing that ? 

Edit: Just wanted to add some extra info as I see a few of the same questions being asked and I wanted to clear up some things‚Ä¶

1. My friend‚Äôs ex is not in the picture anymore unfortunately, has been for some years. He has mental issues and was abusive, so no he doesn‚Äôt not keep the kids.

2. She does have parents and other family members and friends that have watched her kids before. She actually lives with her parents currently and has a decent support system. 

3. We did communicate with each other that it was a girls trip from the very beginning and no she did not communicate that her kids were coming at all. She also did not mention her parents or a sitter backing out at the last minute which is why she had to bring her kids.  There was no other reason  she had for bringing them, she just said that they were coming and she ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to tell me.

Intially, most people automatically assume I'm straight and divorced but eventually find out that that I'm neither. I downplay my kids' adoption because I don't want my kids to feel different from their peers since no one in their circle of peers is adopted. I find it to be a personal circumstance and no one's business. It's almost like asking my sons are circumcised. 

I believe adoption is a beautiful thing. However, the reality is that most adopted kids come from unfortunate situations and those situations can stigmatize adopted kids. People who don't have adopted kids don't understand that because they view the world through their lenses and how the world should be and not how it really is.

My kids are very happy and have a ton of friends. Last month, a gay couple moved on the block and they have three adopted boys who are within the same age range as my kids. The more that I got to know ""Mike"" and ""Dave"" the more I disliked them. However my kids liked their kids so I let it be.

Recently my kids stopped playing with their kids because they grew uncomfortable with being asked about their own adoption by Mike and Dave and other people who didn't ask before. My kids don't want to compare and contrast their adoption experiences for adult's entertainment and curiosity and then be judged. As a result, my kids stopped playing with Mike and Dave's kids.

This led to simmering anger towards me and eventually it came out when my 10yo declined to go to their son's birthday party. Actually no one showed up. They told me that they were so disappointed that I, as a gay man and dad, didn't show support to their family by coming to their kid's party.

114,1echykn,AITA for not initiating conversation with my ex?,"Context: I typically never initiate conversation to anyone, it's kind of a habit of mine even when I love and care about them.

My ex and I decided to keep in touch and stay on good terms after the breakup. The breakup was rough, end of a 2-year relationship.

I loved her deeply, but I have found myself to naturally move on from her. She's taking a bit longer. We both have fell into some bad habits. She has it worse though. She texts me regularly, and I naturally always respond, especially when she vents and I end up checking on her to make sure everything is alright. These conversations typically last hours. While I usually only initiate text when I'm struggling and need a friend to talk to

However, she also initiates text with me, a LOT. Even if it's just friendly. While I always typically keep the conversation going, I always reply, never initiate.

She told me that sometimes it makes her feel undervalued by me and as though I care for her less, despite all the times I try be there for her during her struggles.

Now, let me get this straight, I text her more than ANYONE, even family. I never initiate conversation to any of my significant others, just a way I walk with life. I don't even regularly text, let alone initiate conversation with friends I literally grew up with. My sister does the same too so I assume this is a common thing.

However, I think she may have a point. I never make the conscious effort of initiating and being friendly to her FIRST. I never start conversations while she regularly does, which I understand how that can make her feel undervalued and less cared about.

I'm a bit lost. On one hand, I'm moving on from her, so it's natural for me to not initiate conversation. And since I'm moving on, I start to focus more of my time to myself and start prioritizing about myself and my mental wellbeing first, meaning yes, I do probably care less for her compared to when we were together (where I'd constantly initiate). But on the other, I can understand how I can come off as careless or an asshole for not initiating conversation with her, like she does to me.

Am I (m27) for allowing my child (7) to choose a restaurant where we eat lunch but not inviting her papa (other parent, nb 30).

They normally see our children once a week in public with a professional or me looking after them.
This week they saw them twice because their father (m, idk the age) was in the town (he lives in an other country) and we met him together so the children could see their granddad.

In my family it is tradition that the child with the most important repord card or certificate  (unrelated to the grades, some classes are more important like the forth which decides in which ongoing school you can go, the 9th, 10th and the 13th with wich you can apply to work places) gets to choose a restaurant where we eat lunch or dinner.

My child will get their first real end of the year report card and chose an Italian restaurant with very big but good quality pizzas (Both of my children and I normally split one and get full).

My ex asked if they can come too, and I said, that they can, but that I won't share our pizza with them and won't pay for them.

Now they are mad at me because I should go to a place with lower costs or pay
so they can attend.

I have a little less then double the money they have after taking away rent, elecltricity and heat (for me ajd both children for food, day care, hockey of the small child, clothing etc.).

I feel like I shouldn't restrict the only time a year my child gets to decide the place we are eating at wothout any compromises. And I feel like I shouldn't have to pay my ex anything. Since I'm raising the children if someone pays for someone THEY shoud pay US child support.

120,1ecgntu,AITA for what I did to elevate my stress,"AITA for not wanting to be a part of my nieces life.

I (29F) have a 14 year old niece. My middle brother got custody of her when she was 10 due to her mom putting her in unsafe situations. 

A bit of family history: I grew up with both parents and both of my brothers being addicts. I knew that was not the life I wanted for myself and so I put all I could into my schooling. My dad drank his whole life and passed away 9 years ago. My mom got into drugs. My oldest brother was also a heavy alcoholic until he took his life 2 years ago. Which leaves my nieces dad whom started out on weed at a very young age and progressively moved up to heroin until 5 years ago. 

Now back to my niece. She lives with her dad, his GF, and her 10yr old son. Her dad doesn‚Äôt know how to parent her and lets her get away with everything. I was the one that noticed one day she had posted a video of herself smoking in closet. She denied it and her dad took her side. She then started stealing beer from the GF mom‚Äôs house when they would visit. I found several beer bottles and cans in her room one day when I was helping to find the hamster that got out. I pointed this out to her dad and still did nothing. Over the years it‚Äôs gotten worse. I‚Äôve tried to help in any way I could. I was driving out of my way after work for 45min to make sure she was doing her homework because she started failing. No one seemed to care, so I stepped up and tried to help. This went on for months. Her dad would just contradict everything I said to her and made me look like a bitch in my nieces eyes. She now states that I hate her because I don‚Äôt want to be apart of their drug addict lifestyle. 

I spent most of life with it and I gave 110% of myself to trying to help only have it backfire and thrown in my face, so I stopped having any relationship with her. I do however spend a lot of time with my step nephew which only seems to enrage them even more. I take him to the movies, fishing, play board games, buy him new things, and do what I can to be there for him. They see this as me favoriting him over her. So AITA?

Recently, she cheated on her bf and got pregnant. She lead this guy on to think it was his baby only to reveal a few months after giving birth it wasn‚Äôt. She left him and went to live with this new guy. Her 4 other kids lived with her but went to their dads every so often. This guy has proven to be an abusive person. He has k/o dogs over the simple fact of them acting like a dog. 

After the dog incident, 4 of her kids went to live with their fathers , court granted. So she had to arrange a time and place to be able to see those kids.

She started going off on how my mom is refraining her from seeing her kids when it‚Äôs her fault in the first place. After that whole fiasco we decided she can‚Äôt use our house anymore. She was very angry. They stopped talking because Violet said such awful things.

I'm a 24-year-old female, and my boyfriend, also 24, and I have been together for 8 years. I'm a photographer, and recently, my boyfriend's sister, who is pregnant, asked me to take maternity photos. I agreed, even though she didn't offer to pay, which was fine since she's family. However, she ended up canceling the sessions last minute four times in a row. I could have booked other paying clients during those times, so this was frustrating.

After she canceled again yesterday, I asked my boyfriend to talk to her. He sent her a message asking if she had canceled again, and she apologized, asking for my account details to compensate me. Shortly after he gave her my account, his mom started texting him, calling me an ass for supposedly charging for photos I didn't even take, and saying that family shouldn't charge each other. She also threatened to be even worse towards me.  To make matters worse, I found out that his sister and mother were talking negatively about me with his grandparents, which makes me feel even more alienated.

For context, a few weeks ago, I asked her husband for a couple of plastic bags he sells, and he charged me for them without hesitation. 

This made me feel like there was a double standard in how they view family obligations. Now, I'm conflicted. I feel bad because I never intended to cause tension or appear greedy, especially since I didn't actually ask for payment; she offered it after repeatedly canceling. 

However, I also believe that my time and work should be respected, even by family.

125,1ecg128,WIBTA for visiting my grandparents?,"Reposted with edits from r/BoomersBeingFools, original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/s/ExjrLiZfMb

My (22 NB) parents (55 M & 55 F) have never gotten along with my paternal grandmother, Casey (77 F).  To be fair, she is moody, very particular, a picky eater, and a general grump; she always has been, so it‚Äôs not an age thing.  Her saving grace is my paternal grandfather, Will (77 M).  He has a heart of gold and the patience of a saint, and he‚Äôs probably the only reason they still have contact with their children.  They‚Äôre definitely financially secure and give what they can to their grandchildren, but they‚Äôre not wealthy by any means.

My mom in particular has never liked Casey.  We lived with them for a year while my dad was job-hunting, and things soured very quickly.  They disliked each other before, but now they positively can‚Äôt stand each other.  When I graduated college earlier this year, my parents made Casey feel unwelcome at our celebrations and spoke poorly about her afterwards to our family.

The problem is, I love Casey.  I find her funny, intelligent, and someone I admire and want to learn from.  She taught me how to garden, cross-stitch, do genealogical research, and all sorts of other hobbies I still love today.  She has always been kind to me, and I love spending time with her and Will.

I am in the process of job hunting after graduation and living at home, and I wanted to visit them this summer before I find something that occupies all my time.  They live in Colorado, so it‚Äôs a great opportunity to get outside, enjoy the weather, and visit old friends.  I asked my parents about this possibility, and my mom immediately said that my grandparents would have to pay for the plane ticket and all other expenses.  I have my own savings ‚Äî not much, but enough for a plane ticket without breaking the bank ‚Äî but my parents said they would not allow me to pay for it.

I am not going to demand my parents cover my trip to visit Casey and Will, but I am so tired of their bad blood ruining my chance of having a good relationship of my own.  Casey has always put aside her disagreements with my parents to spend time with me, but my parents cannot seem to do the same.  Casey and Will aren‚Äôt getting any younger, and I want to enjoy spending time with them while I can, and I‚Äôm more than willing to do so on my own dime.  WIBTA for booking the trip with my own money against my parents‚Äô wishes?

TLDR: My parents won‚Äôt let me visit my grandparents unless my grandparents pay for the trip, but I want to go anyway and pay for myself.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-26,"WIBTA for visiting my grandparents?

They‚Äôre definitely financially secure and give what they can to their grandchildren, but they‚Äôre not wealthy by any means.

My mom in particular has never liked Casey.  We lived with them for a year while my dad was job-hunting, and things soured very quickly.  They disliked each other before, but now they positively can‚Äôt stand each other.  When I graduated college earlier this year, my parents made Casey feel unwelcome at our celebrations and spoke poorly about her afterwards to our family.

The problem is, I love Casey.  I find her funny, intelligent, and someone I admire and want to learn from.  She taught me how to garden, cross-stitch, do genealogical research, and all sorts of other hobbies I still love today.  She has always been kind to me, and I love spending time with her and Will.

I am in the process of job hunting after graduation and living at home, and I wanted to visit them this summer before I find something that occupies all my time.  They live in Colorado, so it‚Äôs a great opportunity to get outside, enjoy the weather, and visit old friends.  I asked my parents about this possibility, and my mom immediately said that my grandparents would have to pay for the plane ticket and all other expenses.  I have my own savings ‚Äî not much, but enough for a plane ticket without breaking the bank ‚Äî but my parents said they would not allow me to pay for it.

I am not going to demand my parents cover my trip to visit Casey and Will, but I am so tired of their bad blood ruining my chance of having a good relationship of my own.  Casey has always put aside her disagreements with my parents to spend time with me, but my parents cannot seem to do the same.  Casey and Will aren‚Äôt getting any younger, and I want to enjoy spending time with them while I can, and I‚Äôm more than willing to do so on my own dime.  WIBTA for booking the trip with my own money against my parents‚Äô wishes?

TLDR: My parents won‚Äôt let me visit my grandparents unless my grandparents pay for the trip, but I want to go anyway and pay for myself.",0.0,0.10811837017536163,0,1

127,1ecfv8y,WIBTA to move across country? ,"I (27F) have been married to my husband (39M) for almost a year now. dating for 5Y and engaged for 2Y For context, he is a manager at a local business that he‚Äôs worked at for many years. I have been at my place of employment for almost a year and a half now. I am in a career that I got my degree in with benefits, PTO, sick days, and great insurance. 

Recently, I had a job interview for another field office in my agency I work for that is on the west coast. We live on the east. 

For context - I have been unhappy at my place of employment for several months now. Have spent many nights crying, being miserable, and feeling lost. He has been the one pushing for me to put in applications for other places. Whenever I mentioned these places I‚Äôve applied for and their location, he has never made any comment on them. I was always upfront about taking opportunities if they were to come my way. 

I applied for this position and got a virtual interview that I honestly thought I did badly on. I told him as such, and didn‚Äôt have my hopes up for hearing anything from them. He also knew this. I wound up getting a job offer for that position on Tuesday of this week!! I relayed the great news to my husband and his response? ‚ÄúOh dang!‚Äù

No congratulations, no I‚Äôm proud of you, no nothing. Yesterday I mentioned to him that I know he probably didn‚Äôt anticipate me getting this job (I didn‚Äôt either) and that he isn‚Äôt willing or comfortable to move and I can understand that. I explained to him that I‚Äôd be open to a long distance relationship. My career is one that has yearly promotions. I said I would be fine with adjusting to a move, seeing if we‚Äôd like it, making sure I liked it, and if anything, I can always come home. The job offer is one that can truly make me stand out in my field and give me experience for higher promotions as well as supervisor potentials within two years. I explained this to him and he said we would discuss later. By the time I got home from work, he was asleep, and was very cold to me this afternoon when I left for work. 

He is now texting me saying he never agreed to a move. That he bought a house (a few years ago) and he isn‚Äôt going to move. He is accusing me, saying I knew he wasn‚Äôt going to want to move (this was never clear to me), and being rather aggressive in his tone. 

He has winters off as his job is seasonal. A big part of why he doesn‚Äôt want to move is he wants a job that is seasonal and so he can have several months off and not have to work. I‚Äôm not saying it to be rude but it‚Äôs also unrealistic, but also mentioning it as he would have a lot of time to come see me, for me to see him, vice versa. We don‚Äôt have any kids. 

I‚Äôm posting this to help get some insight AITA for wanting to move? I am annoyed at his complacency and have told him I don‚Äôt have the luxury of being a manager somewhere. I have a job that is going to require a move if I want career advancement or new opportunities.

130,1ecfod4,AITA for accusing my dad of playing favourites?,"When I was 19 my dad took in my boyfriend (Ross) at the time after his folks kicked him out.

But dad kicked Ross out too after a while because he was apparently being rude to my step mom, my little step brother (Sam, now 20), and he apparently treated the family like his own personal slaves while refusing to get a job/go to school. I think dad was overreacting but he broke up with me so I moved on. 

Well, Sam got his girlfriend Ava pregnant and she was disowned by her crazy religious parents and Sam asked dad if she could live with us. Dad said of course. 

Ava‚Äôs pretty quiet and keeps to herself. She stays in Sam‚Äôs room 90% of the time, hardly talks to us and she certainly doesn‚Äôt help out either. She‚Äôs not even 6 months pregnant yet and is very healthy so I don‚Äôt see why she can‚Äôt but I don‚Äôt say anything.

My older sisters came over with their kids the other day and Ava suddenly broke down. Sam was at work so she was pretty inconsolable and even broke something. My dad and step mom managed to put her to sleep and when Sam came home he told us that she got extremely overwhelmed. The next day she ‚Äúapologized‚Äù and of course everyone forgave her but her apology didn‚Äôt sound very genuine and she was hiding behind Sam the whole time. 

A while later, dad said that we should go up to the cottage with Ava for a mini vacation. I was honestly put off. She‚Äôs not a child, she‚Äôs 20 years old. And no offense, but she knew how her parents would react if she got pregnant but she fucked around and found out. That aside, she has made life incredibly difficult for the family. Arguably, she‚Äôs more of a pain in the ass than Ross ever was and seeing my dad go all soft with her is mind blowing. 

I swear, yeah Ross was kind of annoying, but he wasn‚Äôt that bad. Dad just didn‚Äôt like him because Sam didn‚Äôt like him. But because Ava is Sam‚Äôs girlfriend, he‚Äôs completely fine with her not pulling her weight. I questioned my dad about this and he looked at me as if I was crazy.

My mom continued to whore around with other dude while my dad was at basic training. About a few months later my mom technically kidnapped me from my dad and his family and ran off and changed everything including her face book, phone number, and everything.

She refused to buy me basic items I needed for school and self care, and when I found out I had a dad I would beg and beg to see him, to which she refused.

Since the beginning my mother has never been able to be a mother or act like it, and no one but my dad noticed. When I was a baby they had me when my mom (17) female and my dad (18) male, they stayed together for me, but once he started basic training, she became more of a whore which my grandmother took me as they were both not ready for a kid at such a young age. My mom continued to whore around with other dude while my dad was at basic training. About a few months later my mom technically kidnapped me from my dad and his family and ran off and changed everything including her face book, phone number, and everything. Once my dad finds me, he then calls the police and takes me back with a 50/50 custody agreement from court. For a year after that while my dad got deployed my current step mom at that time was forced to take care of me with another kid which was my adopted sister, my mom was no where to be found to take care of me or even help. My step mom at that time wasn‚Äôt happy and had to force my mom to legally take care of me, my mom then again cuts all context with my dad and refuses to let him or any of his family to see me despite the custody agreement they have signed. In those years, my mom had 3 more kids, despite being under 30yrs. She refused to buy me basic items I needed for school and self care, and when I found out I had a dad I would beg and beg to see him, to which she refused. Once I was able to see my dad my aunt had to buy me my basic needs including hair brushes, hair ties, and shampoo and conditioner.

133,1ecfk8u,AITA for asking a family friend to walk me down the aisle instead of my ‚Äúfather‚Äù?,"I (23F) was adopted as a baby. My mother and her now ex-husband (‚ÄúMarcus‚Äù) were planning to raise me together, but they got divorced when I was around three or four. 

Since then, Marcus has barely been a presence in my life. I see him roughly twice a year, he makes no effort to contact me (calls/texts/ect.), and whenever we‚Äòre together it‚Äôs extremely awkward and uncomfortable. I don‚Äôt remember the last time we talked one-on-one, besides phone calls. I‚Äôve tried to get closer to him, but he showed no interest in that so I eventually gave up. He even showed up late to my high school graduation, took a few pictures, and promptly left. 

My mother is in every way the best mother anyone could ask for, but Marcus has never been a parent to me and I‚Äôve accepted that. 

When my fianc√© proposed, I was so happy and immediately got to wedding planning. I really kind of forgot about who would walk me down the aisle until a few days ago. Once I thought about it, though, the answer was obvious.

My mother‚Äôs friend ‚ÄúSam‚Äù has been close to her since I was eight or nine years old. During those years he‚Äôs become a father to me, been there for me during hard times, helped me move into my college dorm, ect. I asked him to walk me down the aisle, and he said of course.

 I didn‚Äôt know if Marcus was expecting to walk me down the aisle, but my mother advised me to tell him just in case. I called him and said something like, ‚ÄúSince you‚Äôre not walking me down the aisle, do you want any other special part in the wedding?‚Äù He seemed distracted and said something along the lines of, ‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs okay, whatever.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt seem upset, if anything he seemed detached.

Later my mother‚Äòs parents (who are kind of old-fashioned) told me Marcus was offended that he wasn‚Äôt walking me down the aisle, and they said since Marcus legally adopted me he should be the one to walk me down the aisle. I‚Äôve never had a great relationship with my grandparents, and when I wouldn‚Äôt budge on this issue they seemed pretty pissed.

My mother and fianc√© agree it‚Äôs my choice who walks me down the aisle, but my grandparents are still trying to get me to change my mind. Most of my aunts/uncles/cousins agree with them. Marcus hasn‚Äôt spoken to me since (no suprise there though; that was my entire childhood). 

I really don‚Äôt think I did anything wrong, but so many people disagree. AITA?

She took my invitation and joined the party. Everything was going well. As I was still quite inexperienced being the dms, I was quite a perfectionist and wanted everything to go as smooth as possible. I tried my best to understand everyone's opinions and took critisms and complaints of theirs pretty well. I even drew their characters as a way to make them more involved with the story.

She's complain I was rushing her IN PARTICULAR and that it was giving her anxiety. When I told her to try and interact with other players, she said she has abandonment issues and don't want to.


I don't know what happened in the process, but we went back to the topic of her autism, ADHD, depression, and anxiety.

You don't understand how many times, how many problems that we don't even mention that she blamed it on those following things. It's almost as if she was asking for attention or even pity.

But the worst part of it is that even if I try to adapt and say that I understand, she doesn't reciprocate the action back to everyone else. Out of everyone in the party, she consistently puts on the least amount of effort. And when I try to bring it up, it ALWAYS just go back to her rambling about how it's her autism's fault, or her depression's fault, or it's her anxiety's fault, or her adhd's fault, or that she is scared of being abandoned. So I told her, that she might be the problem. And let's just say, after that, she just kind of exploded... She said I was an asshole for thinking this way, and how could I have said it, and how much of a jerk i was for not understanding her problems and more of the synonyms of her earlier remarks.

Sometimes I just don't feel like caring anymore. For a friendship to last a long time, I believe both sides have to learn about adapting to anothers needs.

140,1ecep2g,AITA for having a security camera in my bedroom? ,"*EDIT: thanks for all of the suggestions :) I really appreciate ideas on how to further upgrade my security but I do not have a door since my bedroom is the storage area / part of the downstairs lounge area converted to a bedroom, this means that I cannot install a door or any locks at all :/*

TLDR; I installed a security camera in my bedroom awhile back. A bunch of my family members were caught going into my room and now they are mad that I have one.

Okay so I moved back into my parents house  for university to save money and to rekindle a familial relationship because everyone but my dad and sisters were estranged. I have a dog, so I decided to get a nanny cam to watch her while I‚Äôm at work because she‚Äôs sometimes destructive or getting into things she isn‚Äôt supposed to. I decided to leave the camera on at all times when I wasn‚Äôt in the house (I go to my bfs house every other week) due to my personal items being taken from my room and I also noticed things just looked like they were rifled through. I asked my dad if this sounded like a good idea and he agreed, and I also literally ordered the camera through his Amazon account so he was well aware.

For backstory, before I moved out the first time there was a long history of my family stealing my stuff without asking and just generally snooping around. They wouldn‚Äôt return it either, or they would just act like it was an accident (freshly washed underwear somehow ending up in my step sisters dirty laundry and her excuse was that it got mixed up in the wash??) 

Fast forward to today, over the time that I was gone my step mom, my step sister, and my sister were all in my room looking around or rifling with stuff. I told my dad and he talked to everyone even though I didn‚Äôt ask him to. Only my sister is home so I went to talk to her about it when I got home to see what was going on. She said she was only returning paints that I loaned her months ago that she forgot about. She was upset and called me weird and said that she‚Äôs uncomfortable with being recorded. I pointed out how we have security cameras outside the house so I‚Äôm not sure why it‚Äôs an issue with having them in my room specifically, when she is never in there normally. Then she spilled the beans how she overheard my step sister and my step mom talking about how it‚Äôs weird that I have a security camera in my room and that ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our house we can go wherever the fuck we want‚Äù. This made me upset because to me it‚Äôs just for my peace of mind and of course to have proof of rifling through my stuff when I‚Äôm gone. My only boundary is that my personal space is PERSONAL SPACE, but it has been disrespected in the past hence the idea to keep the cams on.

Anyway, am I the asshole in this situation? My gut tells me I‚Äôm being gaslit but I literally don‚Äôt know lmao.

141,1ecefp4,AITA telling my older daughter not to take from her younger sister?,"My (34m) wife(34f) daughter(14f) & I had a big fight tonight over something stupid. I got home from work I heard a louder than normal sound coming from my daughter ‚ÄúAmys‚Äù room. I went in & found she set up a TV on her bookshelf. I ask where it came from, she said she took it from the backporch. In fairness, we rarely use it. I say you need to ask for something like that. She said she asked mom. I say well I would‚Äôve liked to be involved in that discussion. 
I should note it‚Äôs very common for Amy to take things she wants from all of us. Clothes, devices, mom‚Äôs makeup. Mostly small annoyances that the wife & I have gotten on her about. 
It really spiraled next. 
I noticed a small toybox next to her bed that was from her sisters (5f, Molly) room. I asked & she said she took it. I say did you ask? Amy says ‚Äúno, but she wasn‚Äôt using it‚Äù with teenage attitude. Mollys toys were in there. I told her thats not okay & she needs to put it back. 
30 min later my wife ‚ÄúAlly‚Äù comes out annoyed & asks  what‚Äôs going on? Amy text her to complain that I told her to put it back. 
I told her my thoughts & she just rolls her eyes, says I‚Äôm making a big deal. I reiterated that Amy does this often & she needed to ask about the toybox. 
I call Amy out ask ‚Äúdid you text mom just to complain that I told you to put Mollys toybox back?‚Äù
I get ‚Äúit‚Äôs not fair, she doesn‚Äôt use it!‚Äù With a dose of teen attitude. 
Amy just got a new bedroom set at Christmas. Most of Mollys stuff is hand me down from Amy. I say that‚Äôs not right & she can‚Äôt just take it. 
Amy argues not all her things are new & since she gives Molly stuff she should take stuff. Just nonsense. & I‚Äôm getting no support from wife. 5 min of this & Amy just gets more disrespectful. 
I got mad. Clearly she won‚Äôt rationalize it any other way than hers. I raise my voice yell at Amy. 
As soon as this starts Ally swoops in & tells Amy to not listen to me & she‚Äôll just buy her one. I‚Äôm really not ok with that because it feels like rewarding Amy‚Äôs behavior. I say no. Now Ally is mad at me & Molly starts to cry. I hate that. I tell Amy to go in her room to close the door & continue the conversation. Wife swoops in says she doesn‚Äôt have to talk to you if she doesn‚Äôt want to. Amy takes this for gospel & starts replying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to talk to you‚Äù. 
I‚Äôm no longer yelling. I say Amy doesn‚Äôt get to decide she doesn‚Äôt have to talk to parents about an issue. I say ‚Äúok we can talk about this later‚Äù Any sticks to ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to at all‚Äù Which Ally then supports! 
This is not the 1st time Ally tells Amy she doesn‚Äôt have to listen to me. She once told Amy she didn‚Äôt need to study for a test after I told her to. Ally just gets annoyed that we‚Äôre fighting & gives Amy her way to end it. 
Thats really what I‚Äôm hurt about but Ally & Amy say I‚Äôm an asshole. 
I feel like my parental role is completely undercut & the more it happens the more Amy thinks she doesn‚Äôt need to listen to me

143,1ece7u9,AITA for exploding at my roommate because of her feral cat? ," For privacy I will be using fake names. I, Vanessa, 18 Female and my boyfriend Kordell, 19 Male have had consistent but small issues with our friend/roommate Ashley, 20 Female. 

For context, Ashely and my boyfriend have grown up as neighbors since they were younger and this is how I met her. Coincidentally we also work at the same job. At first Ashley and I got along very great. My boyfriend and I were already planning on moving out together as Ashley was planning to move out from her parents house as well. Because we were such good friends (so i thought) the idea of all of us moving in together was smart so that we could save money. 

Fast forward and we all move in together. We all agreed to be good roommates by occasionally hanging out and dividing chores and other basic boundaries. Although soon after we moved in we noticed changes with Ashley and her behavior due to her friend who we‚Äôll call Bailey. My boyfriend and I have had our experiences with Bailey and we both agree that she is not really a good friend to us or to Ashley (if you need context ill post an update) but we decide to stay out of that and let Ashley handle that. 

Although, Ashley isn‚Äôt the confrontational type so she basically just lets Bailey walk all over her. Since Bailey and Ashley have been hanging out more Ashley has not been at the house a lot causing my boyfriend and I to take care of all the house chores and duties since we just moved in such as setting up the mailbox, unboxing, buying necessities, etc. As well as watching her cat (which we didn‚Äôt mind because we own one as well and we would expect her to do the same if we weren‚Äôt home). 

Ashely has been causing me to doubt our friendship because when she texts me that she will be coming home that night she ends up flaking even when i text her and ask if she is still coming she does not text me until the next day which affects my boyfriend and I as we always cook to prepare us all meals. She has done this many times and she also has been more distant and not inviting us to parties or plans even though we invite her to everything. This had me doubting our friendship so when i asked her if we were still close she responded with ‚ÄúWell I think we‚Äôre more than just roommates‚Äù. This really upset me as I‚Äôve always defended her when people created false rumors of her or if they were talking shit and I was always there for her when she needed me. 

But anyways, Ashley ends up going on a 2 month trip to florida with Bailey. This was very surprising to me as Ashley never wanted to go on a trip for that long and she has confided in me that Bailey guilt tripped Ashley that ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt stay for two months then ill have to pay more money for the rental and I don‚Äôt want to do that‚Äù. Mind you, Bailey has already taken Ashley‚Äôs money and spent it on a more expensive place than they agreed on and didn‚Äôt even ask Ashley for permission when she made the reservation. 

Anyways, time goes by and Ashley leaves and we are left to take care of her cat. This would‚Äôve been an easy task for us if her cat wasn‚Äôt the actual worst. The cat whose name is Butters is what we like to call ‚Äúbipolar‚Äù. This cat will come up and nudge on your leg but if you pet it more than once she will bite or scratch you so bad you bleed. And clipping her claws is impossible as she goes feral. This cat has also progressively became more and more aggressive to my cat to the point she will attack her at least 3 times a day. Literally the other day my cat was using the restroom and Butters took that as an opportunity to pounce on her. 

The cat has become such a chore to live with as if we try to close our bedroom door at night or keep her in her room she will scratch and meow and pound at the door until you let her in. And when you do let her in she will choose one spot to sit in and if you come in a 5 foot radius she will hiss and attack. It‚Äôs become such a big issue we have to put a hand towel in between our door at night and close it so we don‚Äôt get waken up by the pounding on the door at night. 

Among other things our last straw was when Butters  peed on our bath math when our bathroom is literally upstairs and far from the litter that is always kept clean and we know she uses. We contacted Ashley‚Äôs sister first as we are friends with her and she had just spent the night and we were just complaining about it with her. We told her that we would be taking Butters back to Ashley‚Äôs parents house as Ashley has said before if we ever have problems we could take her there. The sister told us that the parents were not willing to take the cat into care as it was not their responsibility. We contacted Ashley and told her whats happening and let her know that we can no longer take care of the cat until it is put on some kind of calming medication because it is affecting us and our cats wellbeing. 

Mind you a month before this we already talked to Ashley about the situation and she agreed to have Butters looked at by a cat specialist and put on meds. Because even Ashley knows how aggressive she is. Ashley responded to my message with a simple ‚Äúi know she‚Äôs aggressive but im coming back in two weeks‚Äù. This really upset my boyfriend and I as we‚Äôve been helping out so much just for her to be disrespectful and basically go onto to tell us that theres nothing she can do because her parents said if Butters is taken back to the house Ashley will have to move home. 

Ashley also gets upset that we texted her sister first as she says ‚Äúand you and kordell can text me not my sister‚Äù even though we only did that because the sister is the one who is presently at the parents house and willing to take the cat and I literally texted Ashley a few minutes after I texted her sister. Long story short Ashley‚Äôs mother picked up the cat, took it to the vet, and dumped her back at our place with instructions to administer the cat prozac and another medicine into wet food everyday and to give my email to the doctor to contact them updates. 

This infuriated me as it should not be my responsibility to do this as I am not getting paid to do so and I also no longer trust Ashley to ever watch my cat as I‚Äôve noticed unreliable and lazy tendencies from her. My boyfriend and I also have adhd and anxiety where we are uncomfortable with touching and mixing wet food as we are sensitive to smells and textures and we are also both not wanting to clean the throw up and shit the doctor said would happen as a side affect.

 I know this was a very long explanation and im sure I missed details and messed up grammar as I am just very upset right now please comment if there needs to be any details or clarification.

144,1ece5r7,WIBTA if I went to an amusement park without my sister? ,"I (15F) have worked at an amusement park for the last 2 months. One of the perks of working there is free admission on my days off. I‚Äôve wanted to go there on those days multiple times over this period, especially because I was only working 2 or 3 days a week and spending the rest of the days at home. 

The issue is that my sister (11F) wanted to come with me. I hadn‚Äôt worked enough hours to get her a ticket myself, and my brother who also gets free tickets was running into issues with getting them. Because of this, I haven‚Äôt been to the park outside of working at all. 

The plan was to go to my department after my shift tomorrow and see if I had enough hours to get my sister a ticket, and if I did, we would go on Saturday and I would just process out on the way out. They removed my shift after I got home, so now I‚Äôve got a whole day to myself with pretty much nothing to do. I still have my ID. 

Here‚Äôs where I may be TA. I asked my grandmother (who I‚Äôm staying with for the summer) if she could give me a ride to the park when she takes my sister to a field trip to the local skating rink with the summer program she does. She agreed. On the phone with my mother, I told her the plan. She mentioned that while my sister was going to do something fun, she would probably much rather go to the amusement park. 

Now I‚Äôm wondering if I WBTA if I went to the amusement park without my sister. My thought process is that it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôd be sitting at home bored out of her mind and I haven‚Äôt even told her I‚Äôm going.

Edit: I had an AWESOME time at the amusement park. I met a nice family and we all hung out and rode a couple rides. I‚Äôm very glad I ended up going. ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-26,"WIBTA if I went to an amusement park without my sister?  I (15F) have worked at an amusement park for the last 2 months. One of the perks of working there is free admission on my days off. I‚Äôve wanted to go there on those days multiple times over this period, especially because I was only working 2 or 3 days a week and spending the rest of the days at home. 

The issue is that my sister (11F) wanted to come with me. I hadn‚Äôt worked enough hours to get her a ticket myself, and my brother who also gets free tickets was running into issues with getting them. Because of this, I haven‚Äôt been to the park outside of working at all. 

The plan was to go to my department after my shift tomorrow and see if I had enough hours to get my sister a ticket, and if I did, we would go on Saturday and I would just process out on the way out. They removed my shift after I got home, so now I‚Äôve got a whole day to myself with pretty much nothing to do. I still have my ID. 

Here‚Äôs where I may be TA. I asked my grandmother (who I‚Äôm staying with for the summer) if she could give me a ride to the park when she takes my sister to a field trip to the local skating rink with the summer program she does. She agreed. On the phone with my mother, I told her the plan. She mentioned that while my sister was going to do something fun, she would probably much rather go to the amusement park. 

Now I‚Äôm wondering if I WBTA if I went to the amusement park without my sister. My thought process is that it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôd be sitting at home bored out of her mind and I haven‚Äôt even told her I‚Äôm going. I won‚Äôt intentionally keep it from her, but I‚Äôm not rubbing it in her face either. 

Edit: I had an AWESOME time at the amusement park. I met a nice family and we all hung out and rode a couple rides. I‚Äôm very glad I ended up going. ",0.0,0.02098418027162552,0,1
145,1ecdvnp,AITA for disrespecting my dad?,"I (24F) got into a really bad argument with my dad (64M).

I graduated a couple of years ago and live with my parents working to pay off my loans before moving. My mom (46F) works and pays the bills while my dad is unemployed.

My dad and I have never had a good relationship and I would say he is emotionally and verbally abusive while I was a child. But anyway my dad wanted these alarm buttons that people can use for safety (they make a super loud noise, around 140 decibels). So I ordered a pack of these buttons just to get him to stop talking about it.

His justification was since I go to work at 3am every day I could have one to use for when I leave in the morning.

Once he got them he was just playing with them. He kept making them go off and would keep them going for several minutes at a time. Our house is small so anything that happens can easily be heard. Me, my mom and my sister (14F) all asked him to stop multiple times and he would say ""okay, I will"" then start messing with them again.

We have animals who kept freaking out when my dad turned one of the alarms on. I got fed up after the third time of us asking him to stop and raised my voice. I asked him ""Please stop. I don't know why you keep messing with them, but they are safety tools, not toys.""

He got immediately defensive. He said that he isn't treating them like toys and that he is trying to figure something out. I told him that if he wants to see if they all work then at least let me take them outside to test them. He said ""absolutely not, I want them right where I can see them.""

So I started yelling at him ""Can you f'ing stop! The rest of us live here too and you are annoying the \*\*\*\* out of me!""

He then said ""what are you gonna do about it if I don't stop?""

I left the room and heard him say some nasty cuss words directed at me. So I turned and told him to say that to my face and he said,""I didn't say anything, you're just being hysterical and hallucinating stuff."" I left the room after that.

The day after when I was leaving for work he was awake and said, ""sorry for getting into an argument with you"" and left it at that. I didn't say anything and he demanded to know why I had nothing to say in response but I left for work before he could somehow force an answer out of me.

Since the incident (three days ago) we have both ignored each other though he keeps making comments whenever I'm around. These range from ""still ignoring me?"" to cuss words throw in my direction though he denies saying anything.

I also heard from my sister and mom that he has been talking badly about me to his friends and to our other family members saying that I disrespected the man of the house and need to start paying rent/find somewhere else to live since I don't know my place.

I think that I did nothing wrong though. My dad and his friends say that I am out of line and need to apologize. My mom and sister are on my side and are telling me to hold my ground.

151,1ecdfg9,AITA for stopping my brother's funeral ceremony and saving a life?,"I (18F) and my boyfriend (19M) went to my brother's (23M) funeral. He was a member of the  Peace Corps, and unfortunately passed away due to complications with an infection he got in Nigeria. His passing shattered me deeply and I still have not fully recovered. My Mom and Dad (41F and 46M) have gone into a deep depression because of this, even to the point where I could not speak to them without them crying. Due to this, I was in charge of planning and preparing all of the funeral ceremony without my parents, who were  too devastated to help. I bought the flowers, the casket, the venue, and I was even in charge of inviting everyone. I decided to invite just family as well as a few of mine and my brother's mutual friends, so they could also say goodbye. For some backstory, one of these friends, who we will call Orion, has cardiovascular issues and can't handle heavy grief or excitement. I was so ahead of myself and made the stupid mistake of putting his life at risk by inviting him. Anyways, the day of the ceremony arrives, and I drive to my parent's house so i can pick them up. We get to the venue and begin the ceremony like normal. However, towards the end of my mother's speech for my brother, I notice that Orion, who is next to me, is holding his chest and hyperventilating. I ask if he is okay and he says yes. All of a sudden, however, Orion falls to the ground motionless, and i rush to the ground to help him. I yell at my other friend sitting near me (we will call her Abby) to call 911, as Orion is having a heart attack. I quickly get on top of him and start performing CPR.

I (18F) and my boyfriend (19M) went to my brother's (23M) funeral. He was a member of the  Peace Corps, and unfortunately passed away due to complications with an infection he got in Nigeria. His passing shattered me deeply and I still have not fully recovered. My Mom and Dad (41F and 46M) have gone into a deep depression because of this, even to the point where I could not speak to them without them crying. Due to this, I was in charge of planning and preparing all of the funeral ceremony without my parents, who were  too devastated to help. I bought the flowers, the casket, the venue, and I was even in charge of inviting everyone. I decided to invite just family as well as a few of mine and my brother's mutual friends, so they could also say goodbye. For some backstory, one of these friends, who we will call Orion, has cardiovascular issues and can't handle heavy grief or excitement. I was so ahead of myself and made the stupid mistake of putting his life at risk by inviting him. Anyways, the day of the ceremony arrives, and I drive to my parent's house so i can pick them up. We get to the venue and begin the ceremony like normal. However, towards the end of my mother's speech for my brother, I notice that Orion, who is next to me, is holding his chest and hyperventilating. I ask if he is okay and he says yes. All of a sudden, however, Orion falls to the ground motionless, and i rush to the ground to help him. I yell at my other friend sitting near me (we will call her Abby) to call 911, as Orion is having a heart attack. I quickly get on top of him and start performing CPR. While doing so, I hear somebody yelling my name from just a few yards away. I don's pay attention to it, and just keep pumping. Eventually, the EMTs arrive and take Orion to the hospital.

However, he recently dropped a new track called ""Road Rage"" that I find absolutely evil and deeply disrespectful. In this song, he mercilessly mocks obese people and perpetuates harmful stereotypes. As someone who struggles with my weight, I found it incredibly hurtful and offensive.



My younger brother (22M), on the other hand, thought the song was hilarious. He kept replaying it and laughing at the parts that I found most upsetting. I repeatedly asked him to stop, but he ignored me and continued.



Eventually, I got so frustrated that I ended up shrieking at the top of my lungs for him to stop. Instead of apologizing or stopping, my brother went and told our entire family about my reaction. This led to everyone thinking I was overreacting and being too sensitive. They argued that it's just a song and that I should lighten up.



Now, my relationship with my brother is strained. He thinks I'm blowing things out of proportion and making a big deal out of nothing, while I feel completely unsupported and disrespected by him and the rest of my family.

But serious like I was staying the night over, had a tooth brush at her house, was meeting her friends - the whole thing. In the end, our mutual friend's took my side, she ended up blocked me. Not a lot of closure. Again, maybe a story for another post.

Background: We met through a mutual friend, my really close friend's brother in law. Let's call him ""Dave"" and the close friend ""Violet"" (30F).

Anyway, it's been a few weeks since this all went down and Violet texts me one day saying Dave and her were at a convention and ran into Claire. Violet tells me that Claire kept excusing herself whenever she was around. So, I ask if Claire was there alone. Violet tells me no. But, when I ask if it was a guy with her, she begins to refuse to tell me anything more. Say's ""love ya, but I'm not tellin - not in this"" then leaves me on read afterwards. Like a day or two later she texts me saying Claire and I ""feed off each other's crazy"".

A few days later (today), Violet and I are having a phone conversation. towards the end I ask her what she meant by that random text and she refers to me asking about who Claire was with when she ran into her. She reinterates it's none of my business and that if she wanted me to know, then Claire would tell me. I tell her that's bs, because she (close friend Violet) has told me plenty of things that were ""not my business"" and that typically this sort of gossip about dating seems pretty normal. Like who wouldn't be curious about this sort of run in? After going back and forth, she ended up hanging up on me.



TLDR: My friend ran into someone I dated and think's I'm being ridiculous for wanting to know details about the encounter. AITA?

For context, I have been planning my wedding for about 2 years now, the wedding is in May in Europe. The planning started out fine but as things get closer the more involved she gets, like I want to have my nails a certain color that ties us together, odd but okay you do you.

But lately she has been obsessing over hotel arrangements. At first she wanted to do an Air BnB and was like well you and your fianc√© can stay  here and we will have everyone over for drinks.

It's like she wants to stay wherever she wants to stay (which is fine) but wants me to just not be close to anyone else who flies over, at least that's what it feels like.

While in the shower he said ""I want to ask you something but I dont want you to get mad/sad"".  I told him to just tell me but there's no guarantee as I'm on my period and more emotional than normally. He told me that he didn't want me to take the same days off as him. Preferably that I only took Tuesday or Wednesday off. I told him it was fine because I understood him also wanting alone time. And that was the honest truth.

About 10 minutes later however, I remembered that I don't have the weekends off. Which leaves just 1 day while we are together. Our work schedules are also a bit different so when he comes home, I'm usually sleeping and vice versa.

I decided not to bottle up my feelings and tell him about how it hurt that he only wanted to spend one day together. Also that I understand that we've been around eachother a lot but it also stung that he asked that on the first week I went back to work. He told me it was whatever and that I could schedule off the same days as him if I wanted and I told him that it felt like I was begging for his attention/him to be around me. I also mentioned how he knows my love language is quality time and I started to cry. Whenever we are together, he usually spends most of the time gaming by himself.

He told me that he did want to be around me. He was silent for a long moment and I asked him what was wrong. He told me that he was really pissed off that I was telling him all this because I had attitude all week and was mean. I apologized and asked for him to tell me when I was being mean/had attitude because Im on my period and cant tell. He agreed to.

The discussion ended there and I still feel sad over him wanting me to only schedule 1 full day with him. I think this is partially because most people have atleast 2 days together and its not fulfilling my quality time needs. But I also feel bad for making him feel bad. So,

We got back in contact and dated for 8 months. We broke up and then a week later dated for a day where he broke up with me and around a week later i think we got together for a final time for 24 days. 

Now into the real story!! 
For a few days whenever i had told him i loved him or missed him he wouldn‚Äôt reply and i had to ask him do you? i was beginning to doubt our relationship. and what didn‚Äôt help was my new found information of him being close friends with a girl at his school that i had never known about when we clearly made boundaries about being close friends with girls at school. 
Our relationship was already in a hard place and then he tells me his grandma died. Of course i attempted to be comforting even though im very bad when it comes to emotional people i never know what to say! I of course told him how sorry i was for him and prayed for his family and him. 
Hours go by and im beginning to panic. He‚Äôs active on social media but my messages aren‚Äôt opened? he‚Äôs on the app i texted on but isnt replying and his battery is going down. I‚Äôm honestly spiralling at this point. Is he on call with her? Is he talking to her right now? What is he doing? now looking back i understand that he doesn‚Äôt have to constantly reply to me and talk to me we should have lives outside of each other but in this moment i felt very insecure in the relationship and therefore i acted this way.
i‚Äôm ashamed of this but after my texts being like i love you so much i texted him saying i hate being ignored. 
Now this got his attention! he responded to this with a big paragraph calling me a horrible person and that i have no compassion for him. This hurt me obviously but i mostly felt so much remorse for my actions. 
i apologised a lot for what i had said and how i acted so inconsiderate of him and now we are in no contact. 
I haven‚Äôt been removed of any social media‚Äôs and i have sent him a streak on snapchat that he purposefully didn‚Äôt open but still sent me a streak back. 

Honestly i don‚Äôt know what to do, he was my first love and i was his. In our first 8 month relationship we have never been happier and had the best most healthy relationship. My friends have told me to wait and see if he texts me happy birthday as it‚Äôs in a month but i wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he didn‚Äôt. I was planning on sending him all the gifts i have made and collected over the past two years in the mail at the end of august but maybe this is too much? 

I honestly am so very sorry and it was never my intention to hurt him even more at all.
Am i the asshole? 
What do i do? ",TL;DR,2024-07-26,"AITA for telling my boyfriend i hate being ignored after his grandma died Firstly i am in no way justifying my actions and just want advice on how to move forward. 

To make it clear i have known my now EX boyfriend for 2 years. 
The first time we was in a talking stage his cousins got into a very tragic accident.
