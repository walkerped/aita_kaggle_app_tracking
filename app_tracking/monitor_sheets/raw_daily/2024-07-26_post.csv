0,1ecaivb,AITA for not letting my roommates cat come out of their bedroom? ,"So I (23F) and my girlfriend (22F) live together with our roommates. Them being (23F) and (22F). Recently a lot has happened between my girlfriend and I and the roommates. The reason they started living with us was because they got kicked out and were going to be homeless so we said they could stay with us. Also my girlfriend and the roommate go way back into high school. Everything was fine with them. My cat (3F) has anxiety and behavior issues. Ive decided to get her anxiety meds and reintroduce her to my other cat (4M). Doing this would mean I would have to keep her locked in our bedroom and doing slow introductions. This could take two weeks to two months. Their cat (6F) would go feral for our cats and nonstop attack them so instead we comprised on having all our cats locked up in our bedroom for an hour everyday to let her out. Now here‚Äôs the issue, my girlfriend said that for 1-2 months their cat can‚Äôt come out until my cat can be nice to others and not be so anxious. We‚Äôre making our bedroom her safe space and can‚Äôt keep throwing the other cats in there because it messed with the whole process. They then proceeded to get very defensive and say it‚Äôs not fair to their cat which we replied with ‚Äúwell our cat is also going to be locked up too it‚Äôs not fair either way‚Äù. We kept trying to explain to them why we needed to do this and they couldn‚Äôt wrap their heads around why we were doing this. They came to me crying and shaking and said ‚Äúwhat did we do, why is she doing this to us.‚Äù I told them ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not doing this because we hate you we‚Äôre doing this because we need to have a better quality of life without our cats attacking each other.‚Äù I was trying to be reasonable with them because they were so upset it made me feel bad. My girlfriend walks out on them talking to me. I leave the room because I was being held hostage. My girlfriend was trying to explain so many times about why we had to do it this way. They then exploded on my girlfriend when she told them ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care‚Äù when the roommate kept trying to talk over her and started raising their voice. They stomped away and slammed the door and screamed ‚Äúshut the fuck up you stupid bitch‚Äù.  They have not talked to us since. They said sorry to me over text but not my girlfriend. So AITA? I‚Äôm willing to provide more info/context as needed.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-26,"AITA for not letting my roommates cat come out of their bedroom?

1,1ecabc6,AITAH for lying about why my step-mom asked me to do?,"My parents (15f), got divorced when I was like 5, my dad (34M) started dating the following year and got married after a year, they have 3 kids together. She (36f) lived with us since. I see my mom (34F) on weekends but moved in with her last year at my nana's. I really enjoy the freedom and alone time at my mom's, after school I come home chill, nap, read webtoon, and draw. I don't have to deal with people, lectures, or toddlers. I really like being that way, my mom leaves me alone, we rarely talk, and I get to eat what I like, when I like. My Nana is usually busy so I am home alone except for my nana's MIL (78f).

I just really want freedom and no responsibility. At my dad's, I have a bedtime and have to get up when his family does. They try to get me to do family things and my little sister's are always in my business. My dad and step-mom have rules on diet and try to track my water intake and vitamins and won't let me eat like I do at my nana's. My step-mom also expects me to do household chores and be a ""team player"", and i don't want that, I want out.

So last night, I wanted to go home and asked my mom to get me. My step-mom asked me to stay, because of my dad (he's leaving for a work thing in 2 weeks and she asked me to spend time with him) so I told my mom she wouldn't let me leave.

2,1eca8hb,AITA for leaving my mom out of my will? ,"Lately my mother has been bothering me to set up my will, so I finally did. I plan to divide my belongings between my boyfriend (of nearly 6 years) and my younger sister (21). My mother is furious about my decision and has decided to leave me out of her will because I have ""left her with nothing"". I feel that it is very important to add that my parents are relatively well off, by no means do they need anything from me financially to survive. My reason for this decision is should something happen to me I would like to make sure my bf can take care of himself and can still afford the rent without me and this decision would greatly help my sister as she is only just starting her life and would benefit far more than my mother would. I don't know if I should just leave her some money to make her feel included even though she doesn't need it. AITA? 

EDIT: I left my BF just enough to cover my portion of the rent for a year. Everything else is going to my sister- if this situation changes I'll update the will. üå∏ 

Edit 2: since it's the first time ever setting up a will I asked for her assistance in drafting one up- that's how she knows the contents of it. I admit I should have done this on my own, I just never thought it would be this big of an issue. ",Not enough info,2024-07-26,"AITA for leaving my mom out of my will?

3,1eca776,AITA for telling hubs I won't be the dog sitter?,"I(60F) told my hubs (63M) that I'm done being the one staying home so he can go do what he wants?

So he has Friday night standing bowling thing.  Every Friday. Ok,  cool.  We have 1 dog.  Due to unforeseen issues,  my sons puppy lives with us.  He is an extra large,  aggressive breed. (He's a puppy that weighs 125 lbs at 8 months). Then our other son nearly died from diabetic shock,  and can't live alone until they get him stabilized,  so he comes home with his dog.  So now there are 3 dogs.  I am disabled and home with them all day.  He comes home,  goes directly into his office and usually stays there.  I use to work nights,  so my body doesn't even think about sleep till 3 am. The puppy wakes up to go out between 6 and 7. So I'm pulling 19 or 20 hour days with these dogs.  I'm exhausted.  Hubs does try to go to the office a little later so sometimes I get to sleep till 8. 

Last night he looks at me and informs me he and the sons will be going to the movies on Saturday. This pissed me off. I started yelling and said I am not watching these dogs any more. Once he comes  home from work,  I'm done.  Weekends, I'm not doing shit with or for the dogs.  Any time he's got something else he wants to do,  he better arrange for someone to watch these dogs. I'm tired of being the damn dog sitter and being taken for granted and taken advantage of.  It's going to be very difficult for him to get someone because of the breed of the big puppy. I just don't care anymore. Why should he go do what he wants and I'm here with the dogs and I get sick of letting them in and out,  cause 3 of them don't have to pee at the same damn time.  I'm sick of it and staying to tell at the dogs out of frustration and it's not their fault.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-26,"AITA for telling hubs I won't be the dog sitter?
