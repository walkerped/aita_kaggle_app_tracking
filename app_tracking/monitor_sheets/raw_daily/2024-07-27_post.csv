0,1edmxvv,AITA for storming off after my parents' comments?,"Our city's Pride celebration was held yesterday. I (21) was in the car with my mum when we drove past it all. In the past, my parents haven't had a clear stance on LGBT stuff, so I've not really had an idea of whether they're supportive or not. 

As we drove past, my mum started making comments about Pride. She started by saying ""I'm not homophobic, but why do people need a big celebration to be gay? I don't mind gay people, but why do they need to shove it in our faces? And it's all stupid sexual jokes."" She also told me she'd been invited to go help on a stall with her workplace, to which her response was ""absolutely not, I don't want to be going there anyway. No thankyou."" 

Later that day I was out shopping with both parents, and the topic was brought up again. The conversation went:

D: what time does it finish?
M: why, do you fancy going?
D: (with a snarky laugh): no thankyou. It would be an absolute nightmare. Its full of people dressed stupidly and drag queens.
M: no one should be forced to go *there*. Good God.

On the way home we drove past it again. My mum looked out of the window at it and muttered something about how ""they all belong in a madhouse"". 

I hadn't said anything in response the whole time, in case of them saying anything hurtful to me, and not knowing how safe defending myself would be. But once we got home, I was so upset that I had a huge go at them both (I am trans, but my parents don't yet know.) I,  out of anger and hurt, told my mum she ""needed to shut up about people and accept people do things differently to her"". She told me she was ""simply commenting on people"" which she's ""allowed to do if she wants"". I responded by shouting at her that ""there's no wonder she's always feeling like nobody likes her"". I told her to ""learn to accept other people and shut up being so fucking horrible"". I slammed the door and stormed off.

I didn't speak to her for the rest of the night, or the next day. She since has tried to make me feel guilty, and now I do feel quite guilty about my reaction.
