0,1edmxvv,AITA for storming off after my parents' comments?,"Our city's Pride celebration was held yesterday. I (21) was in the car with my mum when we drove past it all. In the past, my parents haven't had a clear stance on LGBT stuff, so I've not really had an idea of whether they're supportive or not. 

As we drove past, my mum started making comments about Pride. She started by saying ""I'm not homophobic, but why do people need a big celebration to be gay? I don't mind gay people, but why do they need to shove it in our faces? And it's all stupid sexual jokes."" She also told me she'd been invited to go help on a stall with her workplace, to which her response was ""absolutely not, I don't want to be going there anyway. No thankyou."" 

Later that day I was out shopping with both parents, and the topic was brought up again. The conversation went:

D: what time does it finish?
M: why, do you fancy going?
D: (with a snarky laugh): no thankyou. It would be an absolute nightmare. Its full of people dressed stupidly and drag queens.
M: no one should be forced to go *there*. Good God.

On the way home we drove past it again. My mum looked out of the window at it and muttered something about how ""they all belong in a madhouse"". 

I hadn't said anything in response the whole time, in case of them saying anything hurtful to me, and not knowing how safe defending myself would be. But once we got home, I was so upset that I had a huge go at them both (I am trans, but my parents don't yet know.) I,  out of anger and hurt, told my mum she ""needed to shut up about people and accept people do things differently to her"". She told me she was ""simply commenting on people"" which she's ""allowed to do if she wants"". I responded by shouting at her that ""there's no wonder she's always feeling like nobody likes her"". I told her to ""learn to accept other people and shut up being so fucking horrible"". I slammed the door and stormed off.

I didn't speak to her for the rest of the night, or the next day. She since has tried to make me feel guilty, and now I do feel quite guilty about my reaction.

1,1edu9tb,AITA for allowing a minor disagreement to fester?,"**TLDR:** My sister is flaky and I resent that.

Emma (F23) and I (F33) shared a peculiar hobby, when we were young, which helped us develop a strong bond, despite the ten-year age gap. That being said, (aside from her myriad positive qualities) she has always been kinda flaky, which has caused issues between us many, many times.

I moved away for my studies.  We kept in touch and she would always be super hyped for my visits and would pressure me to make plans to spend a day with just her. I'd make reservations/buy tickets/whatever and obviously cover the cost, since she was just a teenager.

HOWEVER, she'd inevitably cancel our plans at the last minute, because a school mate was throwing a birthday party, her boyfriend need her help, etc. Thing is, she never asks to cancel outright, it always comes in the form of: ""Would you mind terribly if I did \_\_\_\_ instead today?"" (or some variations thereof) and well, I don't want to force anyone to spend time with me.

Since moving back, we usually hang out a couple of times a week.

For my birthday this year, I wanted to go to an open-air ballet show and initially planned on inviting my grandparents, but when my sister and our friend, Mia (F25), heard about my plans, they begged to come - wanted to make a day of it and go for dinner and drinks after. I figured that would be fun.

Three days before my birthday, Emma reaches out, concerned that it will be a bit chilly and asks if we absolutely HAVE to go see the performance (which is outside), or if we can just do dinner and drinks. I'm a bit disappointed, but eventually decide that spending quality time with them is more important to me than watching the show.

Day of, Emma sends a group text, asking if we can reschedule the dinner and drinks to later in the summer? Mia expresses a bit of annoyance with having taken time off for nothing, but eventually we both concede that since Emma ""would rather not"", we're not going to insist.

And so, I spend my birthday alone.

A week later, Mia and I are attending the same event, and we both express frustration with Emma's flakiness. We were not being loud, but did spend probably five minutes discussing it. Someone overheard and reported it back to my sister. She confronted us in the group chat, calling us toxic cowards for talking badly about her behind her back instead of confronting her. The thing is, I HAVE confronted her over this sooooo many times.

I apologised for talking about her behind her back, but argued that we didn't ""agree to cancel"", we merely didn't want to force her. She responded that that was ""not a constructive answer"" and that she was going to close the discussion there.

That was the last time I heard from her. It's been two months, and we used to talk daily. It's been awkward for our siblings and multiple family events that would normally take place during the summer have not taken place, because of this rift.

4,1edtyab,AITA for getting into a dispute with my mum over my medication?,"I, 17f, have been taking Vyvanse for ADHD and Autism for the past 5 years, with my mother, 40f, managing my medication. She gives me a pill 5-6 days a week. Recently, my mum won a vacation overseas, meaning I must submit 3 assessments early, including a math exam worth 50% of my grade. The new due dates have been very stressful, especially since one assessment is a huge project requiring detailed, annotated drawings, consuming much of my time. Over the past 2 weeks, I've had more breakdowns than usual and considered skipping the vacation due to stress.

This morning, I asked my mum for my meds, as she promised I could take them both days over the weekend to study. Yesterday, I only managed to finish my main project, spending from 8:30 am to 6 pm on it, then played an online game with a friend until 9 pm, having had no downtime in weeks. Today, I needed to start my math revision, but my mum refused to give me my meds, saying I had ""spent half of my time yesterday playing games."" I explained that I had studied for 9 hours straight and only played for 3 hours afterward. She still refused, claiming I didn't need them to study.

I went to check the medicine boxes, hoping she left my meds there by accident. When she saw me, I calmly said I was looking for my pills, leading to an argument. I accused her of lying and taking my pills, which she denied. I've previously found open pill bottles in her room with my name on them and i think she has been taking my meds for years.

I(22) grew up poor with my dad and a younger sister, my mom died giving birth to her when I was 8. Dad didn't earn much but we managed to scrape by.

When I was 13, a little after I started middle school, dad got into an accident, leaving him with his leg limping. It made him work less and earn less.

When I was 14, time for sister to start elementary school. Public school is free, and she wore my uniform, just had to turn the pants into a skirt by adding more fabrics.

When I was 15 and started highschool, I worked as a waiter at a restaurant on weekdays afterschool. On Sunday, I tend a juice stall owned by a neighbour. We manage to live a bit better.

When I was 18, I got into a college in a different city and studied economy. Depending on my schedule, I worked at a printing shop, tending a small bakery, and tutoring a twin in highschool on weekends.

When I was 20, sister couldn't get into a public school so was forced to enroll to a private school which costed a lot. I had stopped tutoring by then since the twin graduated. With the 2 jobs I had, I worked at a convenience store for weekends, and a nightshift at a karaoke.

Took less class that semester just so I can work more. After only a little over 2 months, I collapsed on my way back home from the nightshift. Luckily, it was near a clinic just about to close, so I was taken there imidiately.

The doctor (my yet-to-be partner, now 28) told me it was fatigue and I needed to rest. Hearing that, I broke down. I don't remember the details of what I said, but I pretty much told partner about my background and why I needed money.

I was offered a job as a housemaid for twice a week. The payment was enough for me to quit from the printing shop and the karaoke. I still don't know why he'd offered me this job.

I started working, we clicked, and we started to hang out more. After almost 2 years, partner confessed to me and asked me to move in. I decided to give it a try.

My parents have talked to my fiance (22m) maybe three times in the 2 years I've been with him. They refuse to see him or talk to them otherwise. They are under the impression that he is the reason why my relationship with them fell apart. Granted, I was a wuss and did not tell them while I lived with them that they thought things were going great but only because it was easier for me to suck it up and bend to their whims than to tell them that I was not happy. Instead I wrote them a letter detailing how from then on I was going to start making my own choices which included suddenly moving out.

Now that I'm living with my fiance (I lived 1 year on my own before moving in with him) things are great for me, and I see my parents occasionally but almost never on my own. When it's just them and me it almost always becomes a lecture about how choosing my fiance if going to ruin my life and that I'm not mature enough to have a committed relationship. When I'm with them + other family they act completely different and pretend things are fine.

My brothers and my grandpa have all spent some time with my fiance and like him, and I love my fiance's family, but all my other family members are disapproving of him because of what my parents have said about him (that he is disrespectful, manipulative, and only wants me so I can essentially be his family's little puppet and that I'm falling for it cause I'm naive). Keep in mind the second time my parents talked to him they called him a p***y over the phone, and had also been upset with me for telling him about how family therapy was going, which I had told him about privately. They then lied to me saying my fiance's mom told them that. I found out later that they were going through my phone without my knowledge.

I know what I did hurt them, and I've tried to apologize, and that is how they continue to act. I do love them as my parents and want them at my wedding, which my fiance fully supports, however when I talk to them about this/seeing if they want to be involved I plan on revoking my invite if they continue to show the blatant disrespect and hate for him that they have been thus far. I'm pretty sure I know how it would go but I would hope that they put aside the hate to be there for me, even if they will not be there for my fiance.

Sorry that was really long, there's a lot to the story, but WIBTA?

9,1edte8f,AITA for refusing to let a teenager hold a spot for his mom in a busy parking lot? ,"I live in New York City and drove to Rockaway beach today. I was driving in circles in one of the public free, lots waiting for a spot to open up. 

I pulled into the beginning of the spot and realized there was a 14-year-old ish standing in the center, holding his phone to his ear and “holding the spot”. I had already been driving around for a while, so my patience was thin, and my friend and I basically just told the kid, you can’t do that and put the car in park halfway in. He said his mom was in the car a few behind us, and we stood our ground and said that we didn’t care. 

His mom ended up getting out of her car and coming up to us and telling us, too bad and that they had the spot. We held our ground and said, “this is not how it works”. A minute or two went by, we were halfway parked in the spot. 

Eventually, the mom and her kid just called us fucking bitches and they left. It left me wondering who was actually in the right. 

my friends and I were honestly a little shaken up because it was tense, but I feel like we were in the right, but I’m not sure. AITA?

EDIT: adding some more facts to the mix so you guys have more context.

this was the kind of parking lot that has like 100 spots total and is one big loop that you drive around, and you could park on the left and the right. They were probably about 30 cars in the loop, trying to find spots. It was completely gridlocked and we were going, 1 mph at most. The only way to really find a spot was if you happen to be the lucky person that was literally going 1 mph or stopped when someone happened to walk up to their car and unlock it. There was no way to like, say “ oh look, those guys are leaving!” and then zoom over there. It was legitimately gridlocked and a game of luck. The kind where, someone goes up to the car right behind you and you’re like damn, the car behind me just got so lucky. There were literally no options beyond waiting it out. The entrance to the lot had a line of cars trying to even get into the entrance, waiting for us to move and make space for more people.

someone called me out for saying he was in the middle of the spot. I mean this generally, but he was about 75% of the way into the spot, and i could not see him until i already pulled fully into the spot that far. if he was standing at the front of the spot, I absolutely would not have pulled into it. I did not understand that he was trying to save the spot until he yelled it to us and I put it in park. I legitimately thought it was just a dude on the phone in a parking lot.

10,1edt84o,AITA for refusing my parents' request to be trustee for my brother's inheritance?,"Throwaway account.  Context: I (45M) have one brother (40M).   My parents (71M,F) both had successful careers and have accumulated enough wealth that they need to do estate planning.  I got very lucky and have had a lucrative finance career that has left me quite a bit wealthier than they are (which they know, roughly).  My brother and his wife both work for non-profits, but have climbed their respective org charts and have a good middle-class income.  My parents have helped them from time to time, for example with a downpayment for a house when they got married and private school tuition for my young nephew.  He’s a little more into shopping and costly hobbies  than I am – but I live an unusually spartan life. Brother and I have a good relationship, though we live on opposite sides of the country, so we only get together a few times a year. 

When my parents last visited me, they pulled me aside to tell me about their estate plans.  They intend to leave everything to my brother and his family, because I’m already financially set and because they don’t want a giant disparity in wealth between their two sons.  I’m entirely fine with that.  It’s their money, obviously; I don’t need any; and I love my brother and his family and want them to be comfortable.  I told my parents as much – so far so good.

Here's where it got problematic.  Parents said, “it’s a lot of money and we don’t want it to just drop in \[Bro’s\] lap.  So we are setting up a trust to receive the money, to benefit \[Bro\] and then \[nephew\].  We want you to be the Trustee. ”  I told them that wasn’t going to be possible.  I don’t want to superintend my brother’s finances.  It seems like a recipe for strife and division. If I just let him do what he pleases and the money is dissipated, he could resent that I didn’t invest it better or exert more control; if I am conservative about disbursements, then he could resent my “heavy hand.”   I also told them that while my bro is not quite the penny-pincher I am, he is far from irresponsible with money (or generally).

My parents reacted poorly.  They claimed that it is not a big ask.  I said that, actually, it is kind of a big ask for me to serve as Trustee for who-knows-how-long , and that the one sliver lining of getting no inheritance should be that I don’t need to be involved in the estate.  I offered to refer them to a professional trust company. They accused me of refusing out of jealousy.  That was too much for me, so I pulled out my banking app and showed them that what was just sitting in my checking account was close to their estate (to be honest, had just received a large deferred comp wire from my firm, so it was unusually large –but, look, I was annoyed at their accusation and wanted to rebut it as quickly and convincingly as possible).  When we parted, it was a little tense and my mom said, “well, I guess we were wrong to think we could count on you.”

it starts when my family arranged dates for me (a softer way to say theyre arranging a marriage for me). i met two stranger before i met my bsf crush. i was suprised to see him, we talked for a bit and weve connected better than the other dates weve had. he was easy going and much easier to talk to than the others. when both familys found out we knew each other, they were considerating to move forward with the arrangement. after meeting for a while, we agreed on proceeding with it, with the deal that we will marry as friends, each others boundaries but still fulfill our duties as a married couple.

for those who might wonder, why not reject the engagement, both our engagement are inevitable, so wether we are together or not, we both will be arrange for a marriage. to benefit the both of us, we decided to make a deal that would also make it easier for the both of us.

It's impossible to get rid of them without clearing the junk/clutter/extra furniture, which he won't do. He's perfectly fine living with pests.

My Dad is also pretty controlling. I'm interrogated about everything. He tells me how to do everything. His way is always better. I could go on, but it's easier to say he's pretty narcissistic and very controlling. Today he admitted that he sees me as a 14 year old, and only tells me how to do everything because I do it wrong.

Going back nearly 20 years our Mum went to West Australia from Victoria to vist Brother & the Grandkids. When she got home she told me my brother had complained that I don't call him very often. (I normally rang about once every 3 months). I never said anything to Mum at the time, but decided to call him as often as he called me. 

Since then the only time we've spoken was when our sister turned 50, he flew over for the cellebrations. Due to my work commitments I couldn't be there the night of the party, but did travel to Sisters place for the night before.

We all had a catch up, all quite ameniable. This was about 10-12 years after i stopped phoning him.

So, we're now around the 20 year mark, and since he complained to Mum about me not calling very often, the Sisters birthday is the only time we've spoken in that time.

Seems to be the fact that he never calls has slipped past his attention, because recently our Sister told me he was complaining to her that I never phone him.

17,1edsnjz,AITA for decline my Step Dad's call when they couldn't find me at my Step Brother's wedding?,"I (27F) was at my stepbrother's (29M) wedding a couple of days ago. For some context, my mum (59F) and his dad (57M) have been together for 10+ years at this point. My stepbrother even included my mum in the family photos at the wedding and thanked her for looking after his dad in his speech. I could not be happier for her as this meant a lot to her. However, I was not included in family photos. This hurt me a little but it was his and his now wife's day so I'm not going to complain and I certainly would never bring it up to them or anyone else other than my partner. Especially not to my mum who was so shocked and happy that she was included. 

Anyways, this leads on to the matter at hand. My stepdad was talking to the brides mother later in the night whilst I was sat near them, half listening and bopping along to the music. The brides mum says to him that its lovely to have my stepbrother in the family and that now she has 4 children instead of two (both her daughters are now married). This is when my step dad turned around and said that he feels the same and he is very proud of his four. (My two stepbrother and both their wives). This instantly felt like a dagger to my gut (I should probably add that my mums previous partner said to my face as a 7 year old that he never wanted to be a father to me when I asked if I could get him a fathers day card, plus my own father left when i was two and was abusive for context as to why this hurt me so much) and my mum started questioning if I was okay. I said I was fine and to leave it but she kept badgering me and then asked me if I had been eavesdropping when I shouldn't have been. I barely nodded when she said she had heard it too and said that it hurt her too but that he hadn't been thinking. Her comforting me set me off with tears that I'd been trying hard to keep in so I got up and said I was going outside for some air. 

  
I went outside and walked a little bit away and had a cry to myself. I even sat on a swing at the small playpark near and in eyesight of the hotel.

24,1edrs0c,AITA for not siding with my friend?,"I (34F) and my friend (22F) met as coworkers at a school in 2019. She saw me through a divorce and our friendship grew over the years. She followed me to 2 other jobs. 

The school I am at is my dream job. I have been here for over 3 years and enjoy everyone. When a position came available, my friend applied and I vouched for her work ethic. She got hired and instantly was sucked into the workplace tea. She started forming hard opinions about our coworkers. I had to talk to her multiple times about being respectful to everyone. 

I started to see major issues with her breaking rules and forming her own rules. When anyone would talk to her or correct her she would argue or roll her eyes. I attempted to open a discussion with our principal to get us all back on the same page, which was successful and appreciated. However, my bestie started saying everyone was talking bad about me behind my back. This wasn’t true. She continued to take stabs at me and make rude remarks when I would follow protocol for student behaviors, etc. 

The final point came between some drama regarding two other colleagues. She wanted to side with one and I told her that I didn’t want to be part of it since I work directly with both women. She called me “sweetheart” condescendingly on the phone and hung up and began ignoring the one. 

After several days of being ignored, that colleague went to talk to my friend. She became defensive and stormed off. Later, my colleague told me that she had tried to talk to my friend and figure out why she was ignoring her and tried to clear the air. I recommended that if they couldn’t handle it, they both needed to talk to the principal. Later, my friend called me upset, claiming that she saw the colleague talking trash about her. She said that she wanted me on her side. I said I love her and I’m here to listen. I gave her the same advice that she needed to handle this with the colleague and if they couldn’t get to a good spot, they needed to go to the principal. I said I couldn’t be involved and can’t jeopardize my job.

She stopped talking to me at work and it began affecting both our jobs making me cover what she was not doing. She then attempted to befriend and bribe my daughter at work offering her toys when I wasn’t around. She would walk away if I began to speak or talk, causing our colleagues to notice, including the principal. 

Now that school is out for the summer, she still continues to show up to places that are routine for my family. My friend is an atheist and now comes to my husband‘s church of 12 years, to sit with her cousins in front of me. She smiles at my family and has been texting my colleague that I am working summer school with, asking if she is going to get my position.

",Not the A-hole,2024-07-27,"AITA for not siding with my friend? I (34F) and my friend (22F) met as coworkers at a school in 2019. She saw me through a divorce and our friendship grew over the years. She followed me to 2 other jobs. 

The school I am at is my dream job. I have been here for over 3 years and enjoy everyone. When a position came available, my friend applied and I vouched for her work ethic. She got hired and instantly was sucked into the workplace tea. She started forming hard opinions about our coworkers. I had to talk to her multiple times about being respectful to everyone. 

I started to see major issues with her breaking rules and forming her own rules. When anyone would talk to her or correct her she would argue or roll her eyes. I attempted to open a discussion with our principal to get us all back on the same page, which was successful and appreciated. However, my bestie started saying everyone was talking bad about me behind my back. This wasn’t true. She continued to take stabs at me and make rude remarks when I would follow protocol for student behaviors, etc. 

The final point came between some drama regarding two other colleagues. She wanted to side with one and I told her that I didn’t want to be part of it since I work directly with both women. She called me “sweetheart” condescendingly on the phone and hung up and began ignoring the one. 

After several days of being ignored, that colleague went to talk to my friend. She became defensive and stormed off. Later, my colleague told me that she had tried to talk to my friend and figure out why she was ignoring her and tried to clear the air. I recommended that if they couldn’t handle it, they both needed to talk to the principal. Later, my friend called me upset, claiming that she saw the colleague talking trash about her.

25,1edrqnt,AITA for not forgiving my sister?,"I (41F) have a much younger half-sister (24F) I'll call Betty. Despite our age difference, Betty and I always had a pretty relationship. She was a sweet and loving kid who got a bit lost after high school and at 20 ended up in an abusive relationship. She started withdrawing from the family and becoming hostile towards all of us out of nowhere.

During this, my mother was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. Betty is my father's daughter, but she had a good relationship with my mom. When Betty decided that she wanted to leave her boyfriend, my mom was the one she called for a plane ticket and a place to stay (didn't end up happening but an illustration of their relationship).

When Betty didn't respond to my mother's diagnosis, I texted her to tell her that hurt me. She said she wasn't interested in communicating with anyone right now and said she didn't want a relationship with me anymore, full stop. 

While we were waiting for further tests that would tell us how bad the cancer was, my mom caught an opportunistic infection. After three weeks on a vent in the ICU, I had to make the decision to take her off life support. The whole ordeal was incredibly traumatic for me. I received a one-line text from Betty a few days later saying she was glad my mother was no longer in pain.

The next time she reached out was months later to ask if I would take her cat off her hands, and then silence for about two years. During this time, she was unbelievably cruel to her parents for no real reason, so I spent every phone call consoling my dad about Betty when, frankly, he should have been consoling me about my mom. 

About six months ago, Betty seemed to wake up to her reality, left that relationship, and came back into the family fold. My dad and stepmother have fully forgiven her. They bought her a house to live in and are pretending that the last few years never happened. 

Betty has made minimal effort to reconcile with me. She ""apologized"" to me once but it was just a list of excuses of why she wasn't really responsible for her shitty behavior. Since then she's texted me once or twice about trivial matters and I saw her a few weeks ago at a family function where we were distant but cordial.

I'm starting to get a lot of heat from my father/stepmother for still being angry with Betty. They think I need to just let the past go because she was young and in an abusive relationship and has (kinda) said she's sorry. I think she was 21yo ADULT when this happened, it was an unbelievably callous way to treat a sister who's always been there for her, and she's made no meaningful attempts to take accountability or to reestablish a relationship with me, so the ball is in HER court, not mine. She's caused me a lot of pain and hasn't done much to atone for that, but there ARE times when I feel petty for still being mad at a dumb kid who fucked up under the influence of an abusive person.

I’m not sure when I had unblocked him but either way I did. Around half a month ago I sent him a Snapchat of a wall he did not respond leaving me on opened. No other communication was done.

I did not add all information as i wasn’t thinking it was important but on further realisation it is important to the story.

I’m 18 F, I still live with my parents since it’s very expensive for me to move out and I’m starting college soon.

I pay rent and the WiFi, and have some personal subscriptions, and now pay for my car and the insurance for it.

I’m a big girl, I have a bigger body type and I’m working of loosing weight and trying to be healthier. I’m used to getting comments from my parents and siblings about my body, but I’ve learned to drown them out and embrace myself, (of course I’m still working on being healthier). Because of my body type I’m somewhat insecure when shopping in person so I tend to do it online.

 I use to always wear baggy clothes and bigger sized shirts, (again because I was much more insecure of my body), but because of the positive posts online and other people and actress being found beautiful regardless of they’re body, I started to accept myself more.

28,1edr2kc,AITA for not helping my mom with our new dog?,"I (21F) am a senior in college. This summer all of my courses are online, and my job is remote until the academic year begins.I love my family a lot and I come home every weekend during the academic year. This is the first summer since starting college that I have been able to be home during the entirety of summer. 

In the beginning of June my parents got a puppy as a Father’s Day gift. When we first got her, my courses had barely begun and it was my orientation period for my new job. I had a lot more time to help out with the new puppy, taking shifts watching her. I had no idea that we were getting a dog. My parents talked about it a lot, but my mom always said it was too much work. One day they went out to “look at dogs” which I asked if they were adopting one, and they said no. I came home and there was a new dog. Don’t get me wrong, I love this puppy and I am so happy to have them.

Once July started, my courses and job were in full swing. Before I only had to dedicate around 4 hours a day on work AND school combined. Now, I spend about 8 hours a day on school, and 20 hours weekly on my job. I often am awake from 8 am taking meetings, and up until 2 am finishing homework and readings. So I haven’t had a lot of time to dedicate towards watching her as much as my mom does (my dad works a 9-5 in person).

Well, my issue is that my mom has been annoyed lately that only she is taking care of the puppy. Today my mom and I had a discussion that left us both in tears because I made a comment that hurt her feelings. My parents were going out to the grocery store and I asked her what time they would get back. I was doing my homework  and also attempting to cram for my exams in 2 days, and project due in 3 days. I was really tired, and I also had plans to take the new puppy to my bf’s house for a playdate, so I was a little stressed. I recognized that my tone was very negative, so I attempted to lighten the mood by saying “you guys take sidequests that might take 10 years” and laughed, because my parents know its true and we always make this joke. 

I think my mom was already mad and she snapped and started yelling at me and crying. I felt really bad and I tried to explain and apologize but she started cussing me out which really freaked me out and I also started crying. My mom claims I haven’t been helping out with the puppy at all, and all I do is sit around in my room doing nothing. That comment really hurt my feelings because I have been trying to graduate early per their request, which is why I am taking so many courses right now. Money is also tight, so that is why I am working a lot. 

I want to talk to her but growing up I found that once she is mad, nothing can calm her down but time. This makes me really anxious and I want to fix it, but I don’t know what to do. This is not the first time she has broken down because of the puppy, but this is the first time it was directed at me. AITA? What can I do?

No one in the family is in California so to go I need to get a hotel. Me, my mom, and brother found an AirBNB that relatively close. Also I should mention my husband is posted abroad and won't be coming, I was going to fly to the US for this. 

The invite came out only three weeks ago and we had to scramble to find a place. 

The issue now is that I have a 4 month old baby who only breastfeeds and won't take a bottle. She had to drink from an open cup one time because I needed to take a driving exam and that is the longest she has ever been away from me. 

They just let us know that no children under 12 are allowed. So I told them that logistically I can't come. They suggested that me and my mother go back and forth to the AirBNB to watch the baby and I said it's just too big of a deal. To fly all the way there, pay for an AirBNB and then go back and forth during the wedding. It just doesn't seem worth it, its a lot of effort to do all of that by myself with a small baby. The airbnb and plane are still refundable at this point. 

My cousin is mad that I'm cancelling as they paid per head and can't reduce the amount at this point. I said they can try and find someone else to invite. I said it's his fault that they didn't write the child rule on the invitation. He said I should not be stingy and get a babysitter, I don't know anyone in that area of California and honestly paying for a babysitter on top of an AirBNB and flight is ridiculous to me. He says it standard to not bring children to weddings...

So AITA for cancelling close to the date because I can't bring my baby with me. 

Edits for clarity: Short notice is because bride is pregnant. I live with my husband in Germany where he is posted. Baby already has passport because she is only US citizen.
Because of the shotgun nature the wedding, the invite consisted of a graphic image without particular guest names emailed to the guests. The RSVP system also let me choose up to three people(so I thought that was me, my baby, and my husband).

The final point came between some drama regarding two other colleagues. She wanted to side with one and I told her that I didn’t want to be part of it since I work directly with both women. She called me “sweetheart” condescendingly on the phone and hung up and began absolutely ignoring one of our colleagues. 

After several days of being ignored that colleague attempted to talk to my friend. My friend became defensive and stormed off. I was not part of any of it. When I came back from lunch, my colleague told me that she had tried to talk to my friend and figure out why she was ignoring her and tried to clear the air. I was unbiased in the conversation, but listened and recommended that if they couldn’t handle it, then they both needed to have a conversation with the principal. Later that night, my friend called me upset, claiming that she saw the colleague talking to me and talking trash about her. I tried to explain that she was just telling me that she had tried to talk to her, and that my friend had walked away. My friend tried to tell me that she wanted me on her side. I told her I love her and I’m here to listen, but I gave her the same advice that she needed to handle this with the colleague and if they couldn’t get to a good spot, they needed to go to the principal. I told her I couldn’t be involved, because I work with everybody and I can’t jeopardize my job.

My friend became very upset with me and proceeded to ignore me whenever I talk to her or had to work directly with her so much so that it was affecting both our jobs and requiring me to pick up what she was not doing. She had attempted to be friend and bribe my daughter at work, which I had told her was not OK if she couldn’t talk to me she didn’t need to be trying to formulate a relationship with my daughter outside of what is professional. She proceeded to ignore me and walk away if I began to speak or talk, causing lots of our colleagues to notice, including the principal. 

Now that school is out for the summer, she still continues to show up to places that are routine for my family, to ignore me. My friend is an atheist and now comes to my husband‘s church of 12 years, to sit with her cousins in front of me. It’s a bizarre situation and is affecting the church, because they are observing her ignoring me.

",TL;DR,2024-07-27,"AITA for not taking my friends side at work? I (34F) and my best friend (22F) met as coworkers at a preschool in 2019. She saw me through a horrible divorce and our friendship grew over the years. She has followed me to two other jobs (total 3 schools as colleagues) as I peruse my teaching degree. 

The school I am at is my dream career. I have been here for over 3 years and have a great relationship with everyone. When a position came available I urged my friend to apply and vouched for her work ethic despite her age. She has always been incredible to work with. She got hired and instantly became sucked into the workplace tea. I went out on maternity leave and she would tell me everything and started forming hard opinions about our coworkers. I tried to give her a big picture background and had to talk to her multiple times about being respectful to everyone (even if you don’t like them). 

I started to see major issues when I returned from leave with her breaking rules and forming her own rules. When anyone would talk to her or correct her she would argue or roll her eyes. I attempted to open a discussion with our principal to get us all back on the same page, which was successful and appreciated.

32,1edqv8a,AITA for putting cones in our street parking spot? ,"I (and my roommate) live in a neighbourhood where 99% of the houses have no garage or driveway. It’s “residents only” parallel street parking on both sides of each road throughout the area. There are red signs all over the neighbourhood, and “residents only” here means your license plate must be registered to an address in the neighbourhood. There are some NOT residents-only street parking about a 10-15minute walk away. We have no issues parking throughout the weekdays Monday to Friday. 

 Both our upstairs neighbours and my roommates vehicle park directly out front of the property and it’s an unspoken rule between neighbours that the spot(s) outside our house are yours. We have never had issues in this regard other than the occasional (neighbours) visitors parking in our spot, mostly on holidays, which is fine as there’s usually a spot maybe 8-10 houses down or across the street. 

The issue at hand is that we have 4 sports fields right in behind our house/street. There is no designated parking garage or lot for these fields. Since summer has started, every single Saturday or Sunday if we go out we will come back to absolutely no parking anywhere near our house, because of sports teams parking to use the fields for sports events. We reported it to bylaw multiple times but they cannot safely tow most the vehicles without damaging the vehicles around it, so they just get a fine, which doesn’t seem to deter them from parking there. 

 We will arrive home with all our laundry (we go to laundromat) and groceries with heavy items and have to park 15+minute walk away. Most times, even busting our ass carrying everything we have at least 2 trips to the car to unload (most days 3-4). It’s even worse if we want to bring our kayaks/cooler/chairs/etc to the lake/beach for a bit before running errands. The street is too narrow to pull over to unload everything, we would literally be blocking two lanes of traffic. So I bought two large traffic cones and started leaving them in our spot when we go out, only on the weekends. 

We aren’t the only ones “blocking” spots, a few other neighbours are too (that’s where I got the idea). In the 1-2 months I’ve been doing this we’ve had no problems. Nobody moves the cone, no notes, nobody has approached us, and we can unload the car without taking an hour to do it. It’s been peaceful! 

Today, we just arrived home and I got out of the car to quickly move the cones, my roommate parked, and as we were starting to unload our items a guy pulled up in his truck, blocking traffic, and started screaming at us, calling us entitled b#@ch, threatening to do things to my roommates vehicle, etc. My roommate and I gave each other a look but proceeded to ignore him. I figured there is no reason to argue with someone so belligerent. He started to get honked at lots to move forward so people could pass and eventually drove away. 

AITA for “saving” the spot? I only planned to do this until the end of summer, as we have had no issues throughout the year (moved here in October). We are nervous about him coming back to do something to her car or our house/yard, etc, but we do have security cameras and a dash cam.

34,1edqfdm,"AITA for not pulling weeds for my chronically ill neighbor?
","My (20F) chronically ill neighbor (72F) wants me to pull some weeds that pop up in our “shared” space. They specifically grow in this little bed of dirt and a gravel driveway (that only she uses.) To summarize it nice and sweet right off the bat, I don’t want to. But we agreed to every other Monday we would pull the weeds, and then trade off. 

Prior to this, she had asked us for a while to pull them, and due to work (both me and my partner (20M) work full-time jobs), I’ve been too busy and forgetful to get to the task. And as a result, a few had taken the area. Though it wasn’t clear to me as most of the weeds are spurge in the gravel driveway and leafy guys in the dirt bed. (To be clear about the driveway, ONLY SHE USES IT. It only has room for one car, and we let her have it due to her age.)

When she had gotten fed up with our negligence, she had begun to ignore us. And while I enjoyed her avoidance as it left me and my partner alone, I finally asked what was wrong and the former was explained followed by various jabs at me and my partner’s lifestyle, my looks and my tone. To which we at last came to the agreement of “every other Monday.” 

The other half of the problem came when she confronted me about making sure “I held up my end of the agreement.” And I had clarified once more that on every other Monday we would, which we had this last Monday and that it was her turn. She, in absolute outrage, rebuked how she didn’t agree to that and that it was completely unfair to her, as a retired, chronically ill, 72 year old woman. And that if we didn’t do it, she would go back to avoiding us. Which, if I am to be quite honest, is okay with me.

But I have been told by my partner that we should be kind to her, since she is old and we are young. So, am I the asshole for not pulling the weeds for my chronically ill neighbor at the time she wants us to? 

Extra info: 

* My partner and I live and pay rent and utilities at this apartment. 
* The landlords have yard workers come by every week to keep up the area.
* The neighbor’s chronic illness is eczema and I think a cold? Honestly, I have no idea what else it is other than eczema. 
* The weeds are fucking tiny man, we had cleared out as much as we could on Monday and there’s literally nothing there for me to see.

She will meet a guy from a dating app, and within minutes of the first date will ask him what he's looking for. Often, a guy will say something like, ""I'm looking for a relationship."" And she will immediately ask him about his timeline. He will say, ""I want to be in a relationship for a few years before getting married, and then wait a few more years to have kids."" She will get pissed, tell him that he is ""wasting her time,"" and that he needs to be dating women a decade younger than him in order to make that happen. 

Recently, she laid out her desire to settle down and have kids very quickly, and the guy said he wanted to continue dating her with those goals in mind, but his job had long hours and he wasn't going to be able to see her as often as he wanted to. She brought him over one night and he seemed like a really great guy, I was happy for her. But a couple weeks later she  said, ""he just wasn't interested enough in me,"" because things ""weren't progressing"" and she told him off and then blocked him. 

I get that she doesn't want to waste her time or energy on someone who is not on the same page as her. But it certainly seems like she is scaring away guys who could be a great partner for her, because she's too intense and wacko from the jump.

I've been debating having a serious talk with her about it, but I don't know her super well and am not sure how she'd take it. Is it an asshole move to tell her she needs to calm the fuck down? 

Edit: Should have included that there are multiple times she's thought things were going well with a guy, only for him to ghost her or leave the date quickly. Last night she was complaining that a guy left her apartment quickly in the middle of an ""amazing date."" I asked what happened. Evidently she saw a toddler walking by her window and started gushing about how badly she wanted a baby immediately. Legitimately didn't understand why the dude bailed shortly after.

42,1edpa9f,AITA for telling my friends that they should focus on improving themselves?,"okay this sounds DUMB AS HELL but this sprouted from something we were supposed to agree on that ended up causing drama and seeing my “friends” expose their true, horrendous colors. and to clear the air, no it was not a “if you’re mentally ill get therapy” situation, they just took it that way and then got offended when they misinterpreted AND denied misinterpreting what i said.
to get to the whole story: i was in an online friend group with a LOT of people. some people were struggling with their mental health, some others ***appeared*** not to. key word APPEARED. one of my closest friends, who i’ll call Lina for privacy purposes, started spiraling into a really nasty hill and she started having bad manic episodes. we were all sympathetic for her; we gave her advice, comfort, sympathy, tips, literally anything a good friend would do. she broke to me that she’s been having trouble trying to take care of herself and finding good stuff to use, so me being the hygiene freak i am, i recommended stuff she could use like which hair products, skincare, shower stuff, etc and also suggested her that we as a group could congratulate her or she could reward herself every time she does something good for herself.  unfortunately for her, she completely ditched that idea and all of my tips and advice went down the drain. she then developed a porn addiction that got so bad it was basically her entire personality. this is still a very sensitive topic for me to talk about and i have no idea if i am a bad person for pointing this out, but she was hypersexual. i believe that nobody should be feeding into hypersexuality or any porn/masturbation addictions but it was almost like she wanted someone to do that for her. matter of fact, another one of my friends was provoking them in terms with their hypersexuality and, as a result, made it seep into their personality and took away the Lina we knew. Nearly EVERY ACTION she did and EVERY JOKE she cracked was sexual. 99% of what they ever talked about was either sexual or depressing. it was obvious that she wasn’t even trying to heal even though she “wanted to” according to her. another thing that another person i know had a problem with was that you couldn’t be positive around her. One of my friends said that they were happy to go to Colorado with their mom and Lina had to drop some miserable shit about how her mom hates her to make it sound sad/attract negative attention. another thing was that she basically spent her time either jerking off or sinking deeper into their suspected BPD (which you NEED to get help for, as you could be a possible threat to others) and me and another friend of mine just had enough and I called Lina out on it. surprise surprise, she got extremely offended that I begged her to better herself so she could actually have a promising future. 2 others followed up trying to defend her but I knew they didn’t even know how to defend her other than by repeating what she said. me and my other friend went into a GC with her and we tried to explain that she misinterpreted the whole message and took offense to something that everyone was supposed to morally agree on, but she just stayed quiet and spewed out nothing but anything that was just her admitting that she was making a big deal out of her life (which we thought she was in immediate danger because of how she explained everything) but she blamed US for taking it too literal, like if we knew that she was making a big deal. she then said that she’s had a porn addiction for YEARS and also tried to make it out that doing weed underage wasnt as bad as being a stoner (which did not make it any better) and i just got upset so we left it for the next day. i had the biggest headache last night because of that. In the morning, i sent another message saying that I wanted to leave on good terms and that I hoped that she actually focused on her mental health and healing for the rest of her life, and guess what she said? she said the most heinous, repulsive shit imaginable. first off, she focused more on calling me and my friend out on shit that we didn’t even do, like “venting over” her and doing the bare minimum, when really her situation was so complex that a teenager wouldn’t be able to do shit. nobody has ever overvented her, if anything SHE was the one overventing EVERYBODY. to top that off, all of that seemed to us like she was begging to be babied, to have everyone coddle her instead of giving her opportunities to heal, and straight up hinted out HEAVILY that she didn’t want anyone using the designated vent channels or anyone even letting out their feelings or remotely typing anything there that wasnt going to dickride the hell outta her or baby her like crazy. it was evident she didn’t wanna heal. she was so mentally ill to the point she already found comfort in it and there was no helping her, probably not even professionally. another person from that group also admitted to being tired of Lina’s tomfoolery, so the 3 of us unionized together and me and my other friend have found out some fucked up shit about her: despite her saying that she couldn’t afford therapy, she actually could. she just didn’t want to get help even though she said she did. shes also apparently a dick to her mom, her teachers, and basically anyone that gets in her way. she also agreed with someone with the fact that we shouldn’t dislike or be uncomfortable with people who are problematic (celebrities, historical figures, etc) if we weren’t directly affected, like how I get uncomfortable around anything to do with n@z1 germany or ww2. that entire interaction was just wild to me but i’m still stuck on if i did the right thing or not, so am I the asshole here?",TL;DR,2024-07-27,"AITA for telling my friends that they should focus on improving themselves? okay this sounds DUMB AS HELL but this sprouted from something we were supposed to agree on that ended up causing drama and seeing my “friends” expose their true, horrendous colors. and to clear the air, no it was not a “if you’re mentally ill get therapy” situation, they just took it that way and then got offended when they misinterpreted AND denied misinterpreting what i said.

43,1edp8ue,"AITA for telling a ""friend"" she wasn't allowed to sit next to us?","I (17F) attend coaching classes with my cousin Alaine (17F). We have a classmate Sharon (17F)

The very day we met, before I even had a chance to know her name, Sharon proceeded to ask me why I had hair loss. I have telogen effluvium, and it's pretty embarrassing when somebody brings it up. But there was nothing wrong with her asking about it, so I brushed it off.

Anyways, things went downhill really fast. Here's some examples of the behavior we have had to deal with on a daily basis.

• She accompanied me to the bathroom unprompted, proceeded to show me her belly cause ""Oh no, my pants are so loose, I forgot to wear a belt.""

• Squeezed Alaina's armfat and said it was cute. It was not appreciated. She did that multiple times.

• Said ""I love you"" to her and said she would faint if Alaina didn't say that back.

• Decided she was automatically invited to my place when she figured I played the guitar, so we could jam together or something. I had to clarify that she was, indeed, NOT invited even though she sang really well apparently...

• ...which she proceeded to do in the middle of class with the strictest teacher (let's call him Mr. B) as he walked through the aisles. Wouldn't stop even though we asked her to stop.

• Alaine has acne, and Sharon keeps bringing it up and suggesting ""remedies."" Primarily, she keeps saying slathering saliva on your face is a great way to get rid of acne. Ironically, we're studying for the pre med exam.

These are the only ones I can think of off the top of my head. The entire class hates her, cause she snitched about what was going on in the student's Whatsapp group to Mr. B. He was really mad cause they had some unflattering comments about him on there, but I'm not going to get into that since I wasn't a part of that group to begin with.

45,1edoske,UPDATE - AITA for ruining my own gender reveal party?,"Thank you for all your replies. Especially those who called me the AH for having a gender reveal. I'm assuming you didn't read my post, but you still cracked me up.

All jokes aside, I've been expected to be a pushover for most of my life (older daughter of divorced parents), so it was good to know I was right to stand my ground on this issue.

After reading your comments, I've concluded that the only thing I did wrong was leaving without talking to my friends and MIL. They were lied to and put in an awkward position after I left. I did talk to them the next day and apologized, but I wish I'd told them what was going on.

A few days ago, my fiancé and I invited my father and his girlfriend over. I told them I was extremely upset with them both, but I wanted to sort this out peacefully.

We still ended up fighting. My father agreed with some points I made, but kept insisting that I was ungrateful and owed his girlfriend an apology. She was quiet at first, but started crying about 20 minutes into the fight.

My father's girlfriend said she threw the party because she cared about me, and that she'd want one if she was pregnant. She started talking about all the gender reveal videos she'd watched on TikTok, and how happy the parents look in them. She told me she genuinely thought I'd love it, and couldn't understand why I'd been so rude to her.

To my surprise, my fiancé was the first to snap at that (he's usually the calm one). He told her to stop calling it my party, since she clearly threw it for herself. I had expressed countless times that I didn't want a gender reveal, and I was well within my rights to leave when she tried to ambush me with one.

The fight didn't go on for much longer after that. Near its end, my father asked me why I hadn't at least played along for a while.

I told him I went there expecting to spend an hour with someone I've been meaning to get to know better, not to spend my entire afternoon entertaining a dozen people (more than half of whom I either didn't know or didn't like) who got together to talk about my child's privates. I didn't mean to upset anyone, but I had to get out. My father didn't argue with that.

There were two main pieces of advice from your comments that I decided to follow. The first was to tell my father's girlfriend she needed to apologize to my friends and MIL for lying to them. She agreed (and they later confirmed she did).

Secondly, neither of them will be allowed to meet my son at the hospital when he's born. My father had been looking forward to this, so it wasn't an easy decision, but I made it clear it was final.

My father called me the next day to apologize for everything, and I forgave him. I don't expect an apology from his girlfriend, but I'm done feeding that fire. My life is stressful enough as it is.

My son will be here in November. He already has a name, and we've just started working on his nursery. I truly can't wait to meet him.

My father called me the next day to apologize for everything, and I forgave him. I don't expect an apology from his girlfriend, but I'm done feeding that fire. My life is stressful enough as it is.

My son will be here in November. He already has a name, and we've just started working on his nursery. I truly can't wait to meet him.

Also sorry for including ""for"" twice in my first post's title.",,0.04546240717172623,0,0
46,1edoi3j,AITA for keeping a spreadsheet of my family's microaggressions towards me?,"I (22) live with my family. I'm in my 'figuring it out after uni' phase and can't afford to move yet. I pay a small amount monthly to help with food/utilities, take care of my space, cook once a week. I'm in a very good situation and leaving isn't an option.

We've always had ups and downs, it was my fault when I was a teenager but I worked on myself at uni and don't blow up/start arguments anymore. They're not abusive, they just don't seem to like me much. Seeing other families who are best friends is always weird because I've never had that. When we fight, we HATE eachother. It's better than it was but I'm still healing from things that happened in my childhood so it's still tense for me.

They're usually hostile, unprompted, and I don't know why. Things like making fun of my voice, imitating my mannerisms, telling me not to 'boom'/stop shouting when I'm speaking normally, triggering my misophonia on purpose, overreacting to minor things like spills, being mean to my dog (this one is the worst, they talk to him the way they did to me as a child and it sets me off). Anything I tell my parents, they forget. My brother will leave a room midway through a conversation while I'm speaking. They've never apologised for hurting me. I don't have space for it all, but there's more. This is just the small daily things, not the big things that have fucked me up long term.

The worst part is they do all these things and get upset at ME for reacting. I've asked them 'please stop doing xyz, it upsets me' and they tell me I'm sensitive or trying to start a fight/bully them or say 'I suppose we just shouldn't speak to you then'. Communication isn't a thing, they take it as an attack every time. I've given up fighting back, I just take it now.

After being left by a few friends + my partner, I've started thinking about the 'if everyone you know is an asshole, you're the asshole' thing. I started believing that I deserved it and this HAS to be a me problem. I HATED thinking that way so I began writing everything down to see if it was really that bad. Every time something happened, I noted it then put it in a spreadsheet with the date and the type (mocking me, triggering me etc). I did this for 3 months and honestly it was a comfort knowing that I wasn't crazy and these things were happening.

One day I was adding to the sheet and had to go and hold my dog when someone was at the door. While I was gone, my mum came into my room with laundry and saw it on my laptop. She was very upset and started questioning me and asking why I hated them so much. I said I didn't hate them but I was sick of feeling like an outsider in my own family. Everything is really tense in the house right now and I feel terrible but I couldn't see another non-confrontational way to deal with my feelings. I love my parents but surely it isn't normal to feel so small and scared of being attacked by them.

47,1edockw,AITA for never wanting to come home again after I go to college?,"I (17 female) am entering my last year of high school. Lately I’ve been thinking of what college I want to go to and I know for a fact that I don’t want to stay in my hometown for college. I want a break from my parents. Specifically my mom and my grandmother. I love them both, but we don’t see eye to eye on things and over the past two years we’ve gotten into arguments more often. I think my parents aren’t really the best people. 
I hear the things they say about me when they think I’m asleep or can’t hear them. It’s hurtful. They say that I’m too babyish (because I watch anime) and that I should grow up and be like the other kids around me. But little do they know that most of the kids around me either smoke, drink, vape, or a combination of the three. I don’t have too many friends either which doesn’t really help my case. For a while I’ve been labeled as this disobedient kid when I truly don’t believe I am. I just think they’re mad at me because I don’t share the same homophobic and sexist views as them.
They told me when I was 12 that if I ever liked girls, they’d kick me out of the house. It genuinely terrified me because I wasn’t gay (they just went through my phone and found out that I had a friend that was gay) and if I had been gay I would’ve realized that day that I can never confide in my parents about any crushes I might have. They say that I want to be a boy when they don’t see me with a pair of earrings on (I don’t). It’s just an honest mistake I make a few times. When I’m in a hurry to get dressed, I usually forget to put on earrings or lipstick. It’s not because I want to be a boy.
They shamed me for liking my ex because they said he was, and I quote, “fat and ugly”. What they didn’t know was that Id already been seeing him in secret for four months before I even came up with the courage to tell them about him, because I knew they’d shame him for his weight. They shame me for my weight and then guilt trip me into eating the food that they don’t want by saying that if I don’t eat the food it’ll be all my fault and that I’ll be the reason why the food is going to waste. They think Im crazy and that I should get a counselor, which hurts because I’m their child. They say this after almost every argument we have.
I want to go out of town for college so that I can’t get a break from them and get a therapist (I’ve been wanting to get one before they even started saying I needed one).

48,1edoayq,AITA for yelling at my adopted mother when I got really pissed with her?,"I (19M) blew up at my mother. I was adopted with two younger siblings- a whole process with one woman who gave all three of us to our adoptive mother. We were all adopted before we were a few months old- it's a whole story of it's own. 

Anyways, I'm a trans guy. I've never mentioned it to my mother (she has no idea), and she still calls me by my deadname and she/her pronouns. I got a call from my younger brother (13M) and he was sobbing. (My brother is AFAB, btw.) He told me that our mom had gotten angry and asked if she really needed to use they/them pronouns for him. He was trying to come out as non-binary, just to ease our mom into it. 

Anyways, this made me horribly upset, and I came home a few months later after my semester ended/classes finished for a bit. I discussed pronouns with my mom, and the moment I mentioned the incident, she blew up at me and told me to go fuck myself. 

I retailed by yelling loudly at her and making her cry and yell at me.

After a bit of discussion with her (and a screaming match/crying part) and my little sibling, we found out that she was apparently supportive of my younger brother, although it didn't seem like that to him- the kid has issues processing emotions. 

So after all that, I drove back to campus and a few days later, whaddya know? A text from my brother, saying that my mom had apologized but tried to make sure he wouldn't be trans, since 'men have hurt her before, and she only ever wanted a baby girl, never a baby boy.' 

(My youngest brother is AMAB and 11. She willingly took in a cis-male child, I don't see the logic.) He also said that our mom had gone on to rant about how much we cost for adoption and how they had given up almost all of their life savings to adopt us.

51,1ednw63,AITA for avoiding my father as he pressures me to get married?,"I (34f) have a boyfriend (34m) I met in early 2022. We originally come from different continents and met while we were working abroad, but we both went back to where we were previously living after some time. 

After being long distance for a while, he left everything and came to my country to find a job and start a family. He lived with me for a few months, met my family, everything was great. Then he found a great job in his country of origin and we decided, for the sake of our future family, that it would be better to accept it and that I would be the one moving there, so he left and I will follow him in a few months. 

When my father (61m) got to know that, he started pressuring me to get married as we would be living in sin and that, for him, is unacceptable. He doesn't know that he lived together with me already and thinks he stayed in another apartment when he was here. Unfortunately I was forced to lie about it as I knew that he would not take it well. His very religious and traditionalist views have made both my life and our relationship quite difficult while I was growing up, but I left home 11 years ago and moved to and lived in three different countries since, so for the past 11 years I haven't been affected by it too much and we had started talking again more often over the past couple years. 

Every time we talk now though, he is telling me that he wants to talk with my boyfriend about marriage. He also told me that if I don't get married I give him a huge disappointment and that is better that I am single than live together without being married. You can imagine that talking with my father won't do anything and there's no way he will change his mind about it, so the only solution I could find for now has been to avoid him as much as possible.

My boyfriend doesn't know about the situation. He has a difficult past and doesn't like pressure at all (like anyone else.. but probably worse). I also want to get married, but I know what he had to endure in the past (he had to go through a quite difficult divorce among other hard things) and I love him too much to pressure him. It has to be his idea, like it has happened with dating, wanting a family and children, wanting to live together, leaving his country for me. It has all started from him.

52,1ednrik,AITA for not bringing “my cat” with me when I move in September? ,"She is NOT being rehomed I am just moving out and mother has told me she wouldn’t rehome her. my mother bought her in 2011. I did not. I was 12. She is a family cat. She just bonded with me.) Hi all l (25f) will be moving in late September to be with my long distance boyfriend (28m) of 2 years across the country. He lives on the west coast and I am moving from the east coast to him. I still live in my childhood home with my mother and step dad. We have 3 cats plus a foster. one of the cats Luna  is my favorite and o consider her “my cat” I pay her vet bills, food, and medication. She is 13 and struggling with Arthritis and is tired a lot and grumpy (yes we’ve taken her to the vet and she takes supplements for her arthritis and she’s healthy just a grumpy  old lady ) I love my other cats as well but I just have a very special bond with Luna. I was considered bringing her but after talking with my boyfriend we both agree it’s a bad idea for several reasons  

 1.) we are driving across country and stuffing my car full. We don’t know where we will put her, how we are going to bring her into hotels and also she HATES the car and just cries and cries when we bring her anywhere. She also known to stress pee and poop and bite. We have to heavily drug her just to bring her to the vet and that only somewhat works. I also don’t know if being in a crate for three days will be good for her and her joints and I don’t want to traumatize her.   

2.) he has 2 cats of his own (I am moving in to where he currently lives) who are NOT cat friendly. they had to stay in the basement because they tag teamed his mothers cat upstairs and injured her. I do not want them to gang up on Luna and hurt her. She already gets annoyed with the two other cats We have one of which she grew up with, and she despises our current foster kitten. I would never ever ask my boyfriend to rehome his cats. Part of the reason he will not move in to my mother‘s house with me is because she said if he did, he’d have to rehome his cats and he said “fuck no” I don’t blame him.  My mother thinks I am an asshole for not bringing Luna with me when I move and that my reasons are stupid and that I should try harder to convince my boyfriend to rehome his cats, my mother and I got into a big argument about it and I told her that it’s not like I’m rehoming Luna. She will be staying in the house that she’s been in for the past 13+ years I do not want to cause her unnecessary stress or traumatize her the only thing that’s happening is I’m leaving. She wouldn’t even let me bring her to the pet friendly apartment. I was living in in college so I don’t know what her fucking deal is. plenty of kids move out of the house and don’t bring their childhood pets with them. of course I’m sad about it, but I think it’s better for her if she stays in a familiar place.  She’ll still have my mom. I told my mother I will still pay for her vet bills as well as medication and food. she still thinks I’m an asshole. AITAH? 

Edit: my mom has no intention of rehoming nor has any issue taking care of her. My mom has no other children and enjoys having something to take care of. She’s particularly fond of special needs fosters and hard to place fosters. she loves Luna deeply. She has a bond with Luna as well. This was no way an easy decision. my mother loves those cats more than me sometimes. Trust me. If you lived with her you’d understand. my mom has been finding anything and everything to guilt me into staying. I know her game. 

Edit: if I haven’t made it clear I’m not just dropping my cat off at my mom’s. I live with my mom currently. I have never lived anywhere other than college.

I also don’t know if being in a crate for three days will be good for her and her joints and I don’t want to traumatize her.   

2.) he has 2 cats of his own (I am moving in to where he currently lives) who are NOT cat friendly. they had to stay in the basement because they tag teamed his mothers cat upstairs and injured her. I do not want them to gang up on Luna and hurt her. She already gets annoyed with the two other cats We have one of which she grew up with, and she despises our current foster kitten. I would never ever ask my boyfriend to rehome his cats. Part of the reason he will not move in to my mother‘s house with me is because she said if he did, he’d have to rehome his cats and he said “fuck no” I don’t blame him.  My mother thinks I am an asshole for not bringing Luna with me when I move and that my reasons are stupid and that I should try harder to convince my boyfriend to rehome his cats, my mother and I got into a big argument about it and I told her that it’s not like I’m rehoming Luna. She will be staying in the house that she’s been in for the past 13+ years I do not want to cause her unnecessary stress or traumatize her the only thing that’s happening is I’m leaving. She wouldn’t even let me bring her to the pet friendly apartment. I was living in in college so I don’t know what her fucking deal is. plenty of kids move out of the house and don’t bring their childhood pets with them. of course I’m sad about it, but I think it’s better for her if she stays in a familiar place.  She’ll still have my mom. I told my mother I will still pay for her vet bills as well as medication and food. she still thinks I’m an asshole. AITAH? 

Edit: my mom has no intention of rehoming nor has any issue taking care of her. My mom has no other children and enjoys having something to take care of. She’s particularly fond of special needs fosters and hard to place fosters. she loves Luna deeply. She has a bond with Luna as well. This was no way an easy decision. my mother loves those cats more than me sometimes. Trust me. If you lived with her you’d understand. my mom has been finding anything and everything to guilt me into staying. I know her game. 

Edit: if I haven’t made it clear I’m not just dropping my cat off at my mom’s. I live with my mom currently. I have never lived anywhere other than college. I am moving because my mom and I don’t get along and honestly I’m “escaping” And my boyfriend is not allowed here. my cat lives with my mom and us already. ",0.0,0.13158868253231049,0,1
53,1edniyf,AITA because I confronted my cousin with his cocky statements?,"My family and I(16f) celebrated my grandma's birthday yesterday. Because she´s such a big opera fan, we went to the restaurant first and then to the opera. To be honest, the opera was pretty boring, but my grandma really enjoyed the evening and that's what counts.

My cousin(14m) had often complained previously about the party, how much this idea sucks, that he don´t want to go there and told me that he would only come if he didn't have to dress up, that he wouldn't let his parents put ihm into a suit cause he thinks they are for mama's boys, shirts suck because they´re uncomfortable and he would look like a nerd and so on. I told him not to be so stupid that he should make an exception for Grandma to make her happy, but he was stubborn and stuck to it, he would never allow himself to be dragged to the damn opera if he couldn´t wear what he wants.

Well, ofc his parents had the final say because he had to spend the evening in a nice suit, a white shirt and a bow tie and while we were at the restaurant I made some comments that he looked lovely in his nice shirt and bow tie and that his mom had picked out a nice suit for him which obviously made him a bit uncomfortable, but he had to thank everyone politely for every compliment.

On the way to the opera, my older sister told me that I should stop rubbing salt in his wounds, but I still made 2-3 comments. Today she told me I had been childish, but I think he deserved it after his stupid talk and cocky statements before that. English is not my native language and I sometimes used Google translate, I hope it's all understandable.

55,1edn8pk,WIBTA if I got our cat neutered while my husband is away?,"My husband (34m) and I (27f) recently adopted a kitten (0.438m) together. I want to get the kitten neutered as soon as possible: he is an indoor cat; I don't want to deal with spraying and other pubescent feline behaviour. My husband is against neutering him, saying he dislikes the idea of altering his physiology. This is not a pedigree cat; my husband has no plans of getting him to sire kittens. I don't believe he understands what keeping him intact is going to entail. I feel like he sees neutering as a threat to his masculinity. I am thinking of neutering the kitten without my husband's consent but feel like that'd be wrong. That's the TL;DR. 

We have agreed before that it's best if he stays an indoor cat. We're living in a house right now but we are renting and ultimately don't have a strong anchor anywhere; we are likely to move in the next two years. Our cat may be moved around quite a lot in his lifetime so it's safest and most comfortable for him if he doesn't get used to roaming, which intact males are driven to do. My husband understood and seemed to agree with me before, when we discussed this ahead of getting the cat.  

Now that it's the best time to neuter, my husband has changed his mind 180 and would like to allow our cat to get out. All of the sudden, Nextdoor posts about run-over cats seem like nothing next to a quick, safe, proven-to-help surgical procedure. 

I think he might see my insistence on neutering our cat as an insult to his own masculinity: in one conversation, he got agitated and said I would neuter *him* if I had the chance. 

Dear reader, while I am a fan of vasectomy as an idea, my husband has never been under pressure to get one or gotten one, and that is not the subject of the present debate. 

So my dilemma is as follows: he's got a work trip coming up in a few days, and I might just take the cat to the vet for a quick snippy snap while he's away. But what broke my heart is that he said none of his male friends who have neutered male cats love their cats. I did see one of those friends interact with his cat (one that has *implants*); it was not great. 

For added context, we don't have kids; have been together for 8 years; we have lived with a cat before, my husband's female intact cat. I thought he hated dealing with her in heat, seeing her suffer, as much as I did; he talked about getting her neutered for the entire three years she lived with us, but life always got in the way. Perhaps he hated the idea of neutering cats all along? (We moved out of the country and that (now older) cat is keeping my husband's grandmother company now. She's fine as far as I can tell.)

However, that was entirely his call to make; this one is our shared responsibility, which is why I'm hesitant to make it on my own. 

Edit to change 'knowledge' in paragraph #1 to 'consent': I told my husband I was considering / posting this as the post was going live. 

UPD: we talked about this again. He has one (1) male friend with a neutered male cat, referred to above, and zero (0) friends with intact male cats. He was just being an idiot relying on the way things used to be in his village when he was a kid and it doesn't help that there's someone else's apparently intact male cat roaming the neighbourhood. He's chronically online but not in the same way as I am, i.e. I've known cats are supposed to stay indoors + be neutered FOR AGES and he watches cats on Reels. We're getting the cat neutered; not getting a divorce, sorry to disappoint — he's a ding dong but he's my ding dong. Thank you all for the comments, I've read some that helped me understand his point of view and get through to him in ways I hadn't tried before!

2. My dudes some of y'all have not been in long-term relationships and it shows.

He keeps pressing the issue and now baby is here is still insistent on doing it. I now find myself just saying no out of principal as I’m trying to make it clear that the decisions lie with me and partner and if we say no to something, that should be the end of the matter. I understand it’s just a sporting rivalry but it’s turning into the principal now. If my son decided to support the same team as his grandad when he’s old enough to make decisions himself if he’s interested in it then I would by no means force him to support the same team as me but while he is a baby, I should be able to have my time with him with things that I am interested in? I think it’s every dads wish to have a son with similar interests as themselves but of course if this isn’t the case, then I’m sure there are plenty of other things we have a common interest in 😀

59,1edmmqt,AITA for getting into a argument with my parents over them messing with my car.,"I (16f) got a car after passing my drivers ed exam, the car was previously my brothers but he moved to a different state and purchased a new car which lead to him giving me the older car. The car isn’t the prettiest, it’s grey and kinda scratched up but I was so happy and loved it. 

To also give some context, I’ve always been a bit of a control freak over my things and all my friends and family are mostly aware of that fact and it’s common knowledge.

So recently I went over to my father’s place for the weekend and the weekend went flawlessly. After that weekend when my father was dropping me off at home, I noticed my car was in my parents parking spot. I seemed confused wondering why it was there, and simply assumed maybe it was my other brother using it which I didn’t mind. 

I come to find my stepdad and mom had been using it due to the fact their car was in the shop. At first I was a little bit annoyed cause I wanted to continue practicing driving but whatever right, I understand how hard it is to get around without a car. Later on we decided to visit my god family so we took my car, I began getting annoyed however when I noticed how carelessly my stepdad was driving. I decided to brush this off. Later on my stepdad got angry when he couldn’t get his phone to connect to my cars Bluetooth and got offended when I attempted to help him. I could feel a bit of anger but once again pushed it off.

What culminated to my blowing up point was when we were going out one weekend, and my stepdad was having Bluetooth trouble, once again I offered help which he reprimanded me. I could practically feel steam pouring out my ears from constantly being reprimanded for trying to be helpful. But this wasn’t the part that annoyed me, it was when my stepdad got so frustrated he proceeded to reset my whole radio to factory settings and changed my settings to Spanish (his primary language.) 

I don’t know why I got so mad about this, but I was beyond pissed and so I made a snide comment saying “Didn’t your parents teach you not to mess with others things.” Which my mom heard and proceeded to yell at me, saying how I’ve “been so rude this whole week” and how if I “continued behaving like a brat”  she would take my car and the keys away from me until I “learned how to share”

I proceeded to tell her that it’s just plain rude to be doing that to someone’s car, regardless if it’s because I’m a child. I also happened to make a comment over how they always do this and how it’s not just my car but also my whole life. My mom got more angry at me for this and yelled at me some more but at that point I checked out of the arguement. 

Now I’m beginning to think if im just being a jerk over something like a car but at the same time I can’t help but feel this issue goes past the car and just how they treat my things.

I proceeded to tell her that it’s just plain rude to be doing that to someone’s car, regardless if it’s because I’m a child. I also happened to make a comment over how they always do this and how it’s not just my car but also my whole life. My mom got more angry at me for this and yelled at me some more but at that point I checked out of the arguement. 

Now I’m beginning to think if im just being a jerk over something like a car but at the same time I can’t help but feel this issue goes past the car and just how they treat my things.

So my question is Am I the asshole?",0.0,-0.007988031022250652,0,1
60,1edmluw,AITA for refusing to help with my (21f) sister’s (23f) baby in the middle of the night? ,"I (21f) am a college student and live with my family still. Last year my family moved into a slightly smaller house, and because my sister and I were gone all the time anyway (me with college, and her with work and staying at her boyfriend’s house), we agreed that we’d share the biggest bedroom. And it wasn’t going to be a long term thing, especially since we’re both getting to the age where it’s time to fly the coop (I would’ve by now but am in nursing school and can’t juggle a full time job to support myself simultaneously).

 It wasn’t a big deal, especially since we’d really only have to OCCASIONALLY be in there together during the summer time. However, in the fall my sister ended up getting pregnant with her boyfriend. She said her and the bf were going to figure it out. It’s a little complicated since he (25m) still lives with his mom and her and him live an hour apart. His mom wanted her to move in because they have the space for her and baby, but his mom smokes in the house so it wasn’t a viable option. So they spent MONTHS trying to figure it out but neither of them were willing to compromise and move and get an apartment in one city or the other. Until literally a WEEK before she was scheduled to be induced. 

My sister agreed that she’d be willing to move to his city and get an apartment there together. However that week came quickly and baby was born. A month later and She still lives here and he still lives an hour away, and only comes to see them 3 days a week (during that time I am expected to get out of my own bedroom and crash on the couch, which is RIDICULOUS to me but). And when he’s not here, my sister gets so unbelievably angry at me for not getting up at 1am to feed and change her child. She claims that it’s selfish of me to not, since she hardly gets sleep as it is and it helps her out a lot. Ive done it a handful of times but it EXHAUSTS me and I remembered that I am young and childless. I’ll help during the day but I am not losing sleep when I wasn’t the one to decide to have a child while ill prepared. 

She’s angry at me for it, which I can kind of understand because we are her support system. But I shouldn’t have to change more of my life (getting kicked out of MY bedroom, losing sleep) than the baby’s father does. And it seems like my generosity is being taken advantage of because neither of them seem to be in a rush to get out.

At some point I believe I heard them saying that they'd leave after the bottle was done (I think it was around 11 at that point). Some of the adults started saying that they should go and stop disturbing our sleep, my dad told them not to leave yet.

62,1edm3ox,AITA for not going to my sisters wedding ,"My (27f) sister (32f) is getting married in a few weeks. Earlier this year i found out i was pregnant, we had already received our invitation to the wedding and i found out i was pregnant afterwards. My sister is having her wedding in another country. Something that me and my partner were aware and saving for, we had never been on a trip together. However, this pregnancy was not at all planned and honestly fell into really bad timing, i had just started a new job and wouldn’t be entitled to any maternity pay after baby. 

I also had a high risk pregnancy with my second, the worry was this was going to happen again and I wouldn’t be well enough to attend the wedding after paying for the travel and accommodation, so we decided it was best overall to let her know that we couldn’t go to the wedding before the rsvp date and make plans to go after baby was here and we could then all travel and see them. 

My sister, while excited to have another neice or nephew, was disappointed I couldn’t go, and tried to help with the cost of travel and accommodation, however this would only be for myself, travelling with strangers on a 10+hour car journey, in my third trimester of pregnancy, with the chance of me having another high risk pregnancy neither my partner or myself was comfortable with me making that trip in my own in case the worst was to happen, I don’t have good relationships with any of the family going and would have been on my own. 

My sister was angry with this and has not spoken to me since that conversation happened. Turns out in this pregnancy my symptoms are worse and have shown no signs of improving, I can barely make the walk to work and definitely would not have been able to travel to a different country. But I can’t help but feel bad because after all, it’s my sisters wedding and I should be there.

64,1edlmh6,"AITA - Spousal Disagreement, No Sorrys Given","Am I the Asshole?

My spouse and I got into it the other morning, and we still have not gotten to a better place. 

He was getting ready to leave for work, and I was waking up heading to the bathroom. We just had a great evening together and our 2T, but I knew when the morning came I had to get down to cleaning the house. I am a SAHM with our 2T and 5 months pregnant with our second. 

In passing I said “Leave the garage door open” in a tone that was direct, rather than “Can you please…” my husband responded with, “I wasn’t going to leave through the garage” and iterated that he did not like being spoken to like a child, and insisted I change my request to  a more ‘please’ worthy statement. He yelled this to me as I was trying to have my moment going into the bathroom. His yelling caused me to start yelling. 

In my mind it was a simple request, and one where he could figure out what I meant. If he was not able to do it he could have said no, and then I could just do it myself. But he kept yelling at me to not treat him like a child, and that I was being disrespectful. 

He went on to threaten not helping me financially, and revoked his before promise to help with my bills. A manipulation move he often pulls when he gets upset at me. 

When he left that morning, I was crying for the next hour, got queasy from the pregnancy, and contemplated even staying wishing I could go to my parents but they are far away. I just didn’t want to be home. But I stayed, did what I wanted to do chore-wise, because I cannot live in a messy house and knew that if I didn’t make any attempts to clean that it wouldn’t get done. 

I tried to bring it up again and he continues to be in his stance of I need to be the one to say sorry. He has shut down from being a productive person, by absorbing himself in his phone. We have been going forward in a cordial way, for the sake of our 2T, which is quite reflective of how his parents act when they get into fights. But his unwillingness to see how his treatment towards me was cruel does not make me want to be apologetic for a simple request.

66,1edl6kw,AITA for arguing that my eyes were open with my mom?,"I (17, M) and my mom (46, F) recently went on vacation. We were in a pretty cramped condo. Our set up was that I slept on the pullout couch and she slept upstairs. The couch is right next to the kitchen so you can see the person in the kitchen.

Anyways, she was on her phone with her boyfriend and went into the kitchen. I had laid down on my side and had my eyes closed for a few moments before reopening them, they were hurting from sunblock. She tells her bf, while looking at me, ""He's passed out,"" and I corrected her saying that I wasn't.

I thought that was the end of it, but when we sat down to eat, we began to argue about it. She thinks that I did have my eyes closed and only opened them after she called me out for being asleep. I said no, that I had them open before she said that. I didn't think anything of it, but she blew up at me.

She started screaming to shut the fuck up and that she wasn't fucking stupid and that I may think she was ridiculous but she wasn't blind.

I was immediately floor by this and then she went off to the kitchen. She started slamming cabinets and throwing cutlery into the sink. This freaked me out and I started to have a panic attack (I don't like aggressive people) and went out to the little balcony we had. 

After a few minutes, she yelled at me to come back inside and began yelling at me again that I wasn’t a victim and to stop crying because I caused all of this. She said some other things about texting my friends for sympathy but not to leave out the fact that I made her feel ridiculous everyday.

I ended up going to the bathroom and having a panic attack, my worse one to date. My limbs were numb, I was shivering, I even started foaming at the mouth.

The next day, we barely said anything to each other.

This morning, we left and started our way back home. Before we left she said that she needed to say a few things to me and started yelling again that she has never been happier to go home and to leave a vacation. She said that it wasn’t her responsibility to fix our relationship and that I must think I’m cute for sulking and not speaking to her.

For some context, she is a single mother and I’m an only child. We only have each other and it’s been like that for nearly 10 years. I don’t sneak out, drink, or smoke. I’m not a problem child, I get good grades and I’m in honors and AP courses. I have been nothing but respectful to her and appreciative and everything she does for me. She went back to college and finished her degree so she could provide for us.

69,1edl0en,AITA for accusing my manager for not picking up rounds at the pub?,"For context: My colleagues and I usually drink at a pub near our office. The pub is usually quite busy, so rather than all of us getting our own drink, we just take turns getting rounds for everyone. We don't really keep track of when it's each other's turn, but I'd say we do it pretty evenly. All except for our manager, who always drinks but we've never seen him get a round.

The incident: A few days ago, a few of us decided to get a drink after work. Not many of us were in the office, so at the end only 3 of us decided to go. The pub was even busier than usual, and since we were a small group we decided to go to a restaurant with a bar for drinks instead. After about an hour, a 4th colleague joined us, she couldn't join earlier because she had to finish off some extra work. At this point we were feeling like going home soon, so she just had a small drink to talk to us for a bit.

Since this is a restaurant, the bill came at the end. The waiter handed me the bill, just because I was sitting closest to the waiter. The 3 of us had 3 pints each, we all drank the same thing. The others said let's split this time which I agreed, but I said let's just split the bill between the 3 of us.

The manager then asked me ""why?"". I told him splitting four-ways was not fair, and I just figured it was easier to just split the bill equally three-ways since the 4th colleague could only join at the end and only had a small drink (and honestly it just felt kind of petty to ask her to pay for that 1 small drink when she only had it to stay and chat with us), but I'm also happy to just each pay for what we had. The manager then said ""I think you're a bit of a dick to just assume we'd split the bill only between the 3 of us."" I was a bit taken aback with his comment so out of instinct I just said ""Well it's no different than how you always drink but you never get a round at the pub.""

His face got red immediately and said he gets rounds all the time I just never noticed it. He then turned to the others and said ""you guys have seen me get a round"". The others stayed silent because we all know he never picked up a round and all of us have talked about it before. I didn't want to fight so I just said ""ok"" and in the end we just paid for what we had.

The other colleague later told me afterwards that he thought I was a bit of an AH because I accused my manager so directly, and that it put him on the spot when the manager asked about the rounds. I said I was sorry for being a bit tactless, honestly I'm a direct person I just say what I think.

For the entire day, all i did was sit around and drink a couple of beers. I wasn't having any fun at all and didn't really feel like i should be here.

In the last two years I developed a migraine with visual aura. Means I start losing vision partly for roughly an hour (increasing in severity) until it comes back rather quickly and is replaced by a headache in varying intensity. 
The frequency has increased from monthly to biweekly in the last few months. My fiance and I (29) have a baby (M6m). I am in the process of trying different medication, but so far the best treatment has proven to be sleep and moving as little and slowly as possible. This - of course - has strained my partner additionally, nevertheless she is very understanding so far. 

Today is the wedding of her cousin which the entire family is attending. I got an aura early this morning with the typical headache. This is unexpected since my last episode was only 8 days ago. However, due to a business trip and both of us getting sick, I did not get a lot of rest during and after that day and it was a particularly bad episode. The bad week and not expecting it is why I am especially annoyed by the quick resurfacing of the migraine. Also, I am used to being able to ""bite through"" if necessary, but the migraine has taught me repeatedly, that this is not a good option. 

So after some deliberation I decided to stay at home today. While still being understanding, my partner voiced her annoyance and now texted me twice if I felt  better and wanted to join for the evening. I declined again, because the headache still lingers and I feel like the setting would increase it again plus make tomorrow bad as well.

74,1edjyud,AITA (35f) for scolding my sister (46f) for badmouthing our father to our other sibling ,"Throwaway. Background: My family members are spread across 3 continents. It’s a complicated story and it wasn’t by choice but has made maintaining family ties more difficult for us.

I (35f) live in America with my brother (40m). Our sister (45f) lives in Europe, where my father (76m) also lives. My sister has a toddler daughter. 

My brother has young kids and his relationship with my father has been strained, in part because my father hasn’t visited America in many years. My father could have made more of an effort, but my brother also iced him out. My father is the oldest and only surviving son in his family, and he would go back to our country of origin every year to take care of his parents before they died. I’ve seen my father more than my brother has, because I take trips to Europe. My brother hasn’t visited Europe in years.

Now, my father is planning a visit to see my brother and his kids. The visit is supposed to be about repairing their relationship. I’ve been encouraging them both to take this step and forgive each other. The fact that my brother accepted my father coming is a huge deal. Until very recently, my brother refused to see my father. 

A few months ago, my sister (45f) told me and my brother that my father, her only relative living in Europe, had skipped her daughter’s 1st birthday celebration. She had rented a hall for a party. She said my father was completely absent and decided to go to a political event in another nearby country that was important to him instead. She made it sound like my father had abandoned his niece and didn’t care.

When I first heard this, I got very upset and saw my father in a different light. I suspect my brother hearing this also made him more hesitant to host my father during his trip. 

I asked my father about it and he said that he did go to a long scheduled political event, that it was important to him and that he had told my sister many times that he had a scheduling conflict. But he did go to my sister’s house the day before (on the day of my niece’s actual birthday) and given my niece gifts, had a photo shoot with my niece and enjoyed cake as a family. I saw the pictures. 

My sister didn’t mention this AT ALL and made it sound like my dad was some deadbeat absent grandfather. My father also visits my sister once a week despite living in a different city.

My dad isn’t perfect and I can understand my sister’s disappointed. But I feel like she’s being dishonest and stoking more divisions among the family by not acknowledging the effort he did make. I told her this and that she should accept who our father is and not try to change him (she doesn’t like his politics) and acknowledge his effort where he makes it. I said she shouldn’t be shit talking our father to our brother during a critical time where I feel she needs to support their efforts to repair their bond.

My sister got furious and cursed me out, said she doesn’t have to explain herself and that I don’t have a right to tell her how to feel. AITAH?",Everyone Sucks,2024-07-27,"AITA (35f) for scolding my sister (46f) for badmouthing our father to our other sibling  Throwaway. Background: My family members are spread across 3 continents. It’s a complicated story and it wasn’t by choice but has made maintaining family ties more difficult for us.

I (35f) live in America with my brother (40m). Our sister (45f) lives in Europe, where my father (76m) also lives. My sister has a toddler daughter. 

My brother has young kids and his relationship with my father has been strained, in part because my father hasn’t visited America in many years. My father could have made more of an effort, but my brother also iced him out. My father is the oldest and only surviving son in his family, and he would go back to our country of origin every year to take care of his parents before they died. I’ve seen my father more than my brother has, because I take trips to Europe. My brother hasn’t visited Europe in years.

Now, my father is planning a visit to see my brother and his kids. The visit is supposed to be about repairing their relationship. I’ve been encouraging them both to take this step and forgive each other. The fact that my brother accepted my father coming is a huge deal. Until very recently, my brother refused to see my father. 

A few months ago, my sister (45f) told me and my brother that my father, her only relative living in Europe, had skipped her daughter’s 1st birthday celebration. She had rented a hall for a party. She said my father was completely absent and decided to go to a political event in another nearby country that was important to him instead. She made it sound like my father had abandoned his niece and didn’t care.

When I first heard this, I got very upset and saw my father in a different light. I suspect my brother hearing this also made him more hesitant to host my father during his trip. 

I asked my father about it and he said that he did go to a long scheduled political event, that it was important to him and that he had told my sister many times that he had a scheduling conflict. But he did go to my sister’s house the day before (on the day of my niece’s actual birthday) and given my niece gifts, had a photo shoot with my niece and enjoyed cake as a family. I saw the pictures. 

My sister didn’t mention this AT ALL and made it sound like my dad was some deadbeat absent grandfather. My father also visits my sister once a week despite living in a different city.

My dad isn’t perfect and I can understand my sister’s disappointed. But I feel like she’s being dishonest and stoking more divisions among the family by not acknowledging the effort he did make. I told her this and that she should accept who our father is and not try to change him (she doesn’t like his politics) and acknowledge his effort where he makes it. I said she shouldn’t be shit talking our father to our brother during a critical time where I feel she needs to support their efforts to repair their bond.

My sister got furious and cursed me out, said she doesn’t have to explain herself and that I don’t have a right to tell her how to feel. AITAH?",2.0,1.0578421354293823,1,0

Now, we’re going to have our “very late” graduation this July, because of that we requested a day off from work and it was granted as long as we make up for it another day to avoid any deductions from our salary.

My other friend, Chloe, was also told to come at 2 pm the next day but also requested to do it next week instead and it was granted.

- I have a knee injury and can’t stand for too long. 

Current situation:
- The official wedding at the courthouse and the ceremony are finished. We now have 30 minutes before the reception starts and after 1,5h the diner starts.

- I just went to sit in my car for a bit (because of my knee) and now I’m thinking to go eat some ice cream instead of going to the reception…

83,1edh1c2,AITA for not inviting the person who got us concert tickets to our group activity?,"For context, here are the people involved: Kyle, Paul, and Dana. Kyle and Paul are close friends of mine. Kyle is really good friends with Dana, but I've only met Dana a couple of times, so she's more of an acquaintance to me.

Last year, Dana got us tickets to Taylor Swift's Eras Tour. We were all very grateful and even planned a thank-you picnic. During this time, Paul and Dana started dating but eventually broke up on good terms, so Paul still planned to attend the concert with Dana.

Fast forward one year, two weeks before the concert, Dana created a group chat with the four of us to plan the trip. She was a bit distant and immediately told us she found her own accommodation, suggesting we figure out ours. At the same time, Kyle and I started planning a friendship bracelet making session (which is a thing for TS concerts), but we knew that Paul and Dana had broken up and didn't want to make it awkward between them since we both didn't know what exactly went down between them. We decided that I text Paul and Kyle would text Dana, and ask them if they would be comfortable making bracelets together. Paul replied to me saying that they didn't end in bad terms, but the less he knows about her the better.

Soon after, Dana got tickets to an earlier concert and went by herself. She wrote in the group that she will sell her ticket and wasn't going with us anymore, and immediately after she left our group chat.

Kyle, Paul and me then started discussing more details for the upcoming concert, and I invited them over to make bracelets. I sent the invitation directly in our group chat because it was easier and didn't think much about it. But then, Kyle took pictures of us making bracelets and posted them, which Dana then saw and felt very upset.

Honestly I found it funny when she called us immature when she's the one making a big deal out of this. But AITA for not inviting Dana?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-27,"AITA for not inviting the person who got us concert tickets to our group activity? For context, here are the people involved: Kyle, Paul, and Dana. Kyle and Paul are close friends of mine. Kyle is really good friends with Dana, but I've only met Dana a couple of times, so she's more of an acquaintance to me.

Last year, Dana got us tickets to Taylor Swift's Eras Tour. We were all very grateful and even planned a thank-you picnic. During this time, Paul and Dana started dating but eventually broke up on good terms, so Paul still planned to attend the concert with Dana.

Fast forward one year, two weeks before the concert, Dana created a group chat with the four of us to plan the trip. She was a bit distant and immediately told us she found her own accommodation, suggesting we figure out ours. At the same time, Kyle and I started planning a friendship bracelet making session (which is a thing for TS concerts), but we knew that Paul and Dana had broken up and didn't want to make it awkward between them since we both didn't know what exactly went down between them. We decided that I text Paul and Kyle would text Dana, and ask them if they would be comfortable making bracelets together. Paul replied to me saying that they didn't end in bad terms, but the less he knows about her the better.

Soon after, Dana got tickets to an earlier concert and went by herself. She wrote in the group that she will sell her ticket and wasn't going with us anymore, and immediately after she left our group chat.

Kyle, Paul and me then started discussing more details for the upcoming concert, and I invited them over to make bracelets. I sent the invitation directly in our group chat because it was easier and didn't think much about it. But then, Kyle took pictures of us making bracelets and posted them, which Dana then saw and felt very upset.

84,1edfzer,AITAH for asking for my money back? ,"
There are 2 colleagues that I work relatively close with. Due to my role in the company I earn significantly more than them. Since I started working at the company, 2 years ago, I have been feeling more and more like I am being taken advantage of financially. 

Out of generosity I have helped them out a few times with money. Sometimes I didnt expect it back and I have let them know and then times when I did want my money back, I did not recieve it. Each time I had to write it off to keep the peace. 

Whatever I bring to eat at work, they have the expectation that I am supposed to bring for them as well. Even if its just a sweet, comments get thrown around that I am eating behind their backs if i bring myself food to eat. They also expect me to order them lunch at least once or twice a week. If I dont pay for this I hear from other colleagues that I am selfish and an asshole for expecting them to pay for their own food. 

Recently, one colleague's child stayed home from school due to being sick. She does sport for a club in the afternoon and sent her mom a voice note crying that she wanted to attend sport training. Because she was home, she needed to be ubered to the training venue and due to the time of the training the cost was more than double the normal uber fees. This colleague didnt have the money and asked me to uber her child and i made it clear i wanted my money back becuase not only did i think it was unnecessary for the child to go to sports while sick but i also thought it was disrespectful to expect someone else to pay so much for a uber ride that wasnt even a need. 

I was called an asshole by everyone by wanting my money back because according to them i earn a lot of money and should do it to help out the colleague.

A little background first. The night before her wedding she had a breakdown and didn't want to marry her now husband. He's in his late 40's, has another older child he doesn't have a relationship with and lives off of Annie. He doesn't work, they both live with her parents... it's a mess and we were all really hoping she was going to back out of the wedding because she could do so much better. But here we are, they are having a baby.  
  
Anyways, she is having a baby shower now and put no registry so my wife winged it on a nice gift of some baby clothes, some burp rags, and some tactile baby toy thing. We spent around $100. Then an update to the invite came to our email:

I have a little problem with the ""in addition to"" bit. It seems really tacky. I get that she can use the help because her husband is just a deadbeat but it seems like a demand and I don't really want to spend anything extra because I don't think you should demand a gift like that. If you wanted or needed those things you should have put it on the registry or maybe asked in a nice way?

I told him I would upgrade it as long as he paid the difference. I made sure to tell him that I would cancel it after one month and he said okay. We used to have the $7 account and I upgraded to the $23, so he would have to pay $16. Fast forward to tonight, where I checked my account and realized that I didn’t cancel the upgrade for this month. I was charged already and told him that he was going to have to pay the money for this month too (total of $32). He argued back, saying that I was the one in charge of canceling it and that it was my fault that I forgot to. I told him that it was his fault I upgraded in the first place and that I never would have had to pay this much had he not asked for an upgrade earlier. My daughter (16) is siding with him saying that it wasn’t his fault and requested I post it here to find out. So AITA?

But since he has a job now he wanted to pay the difference once I said no to this one. I have always been forgetful and they know it… when I told him, he started laughing and started calling me pea brain and that I am very predictable and that he hasn’t even finished the show anyways. So I said, oh ok, then you pay for the second month! He knew all along I did not cancel… then we all started bickering and my daughter posted this to get your opinion. I figured it was important to give you some context even though I as an adult shouldn’t bitch about $16… but really, he has been been talking back to me a lot lately and I have been super stressed this week because of him.

Recently I feel as though he doesn't want to go on these outings with me because he's been getting later and later.

Normally he drives the thirty minutes from his place to mine, or fifteen from work to mine, and then we leave from there. There's been a few occasions when I would go pick him up from his and hang out.

But today its driving me crazy, I have to go pick up my dog from my grandmas ( we couldn't take her on a family river trip because shes reactive and doesn't like water) and I asked him if we would want to go with me. I couldn't go pick him up because it would be really out of the way from the two hour drive to my grandmothers. He said he was okay driving over to mine, taking my younger brother to work and then leave from there.

He asked me two days ago what time he should get to mine, I told him 7:30 am-8 am. it is now almost 8 and he is just now leaving his house and wont be at mine til almost 8:30.

I've asked him to be here earlier and I've told him earlier times and he is still late. It makes feel unimportant and I don't know what I should do or say to him. I've tried to explain that I have time limits on some things, and he says he understands and then goes back to not showing up on time.

90,1ede685,AITA for not helping my friend in a foreign country when I was the host and responsible for their wellbeing?  ,"I invited my college friends to come to my country to visit and tour my home city, and we had a blast. A unwritten rule in my country (potentially exposing myself here to those who know), is that if you saw an old person (anyone really, but especially old people) on the street that fell, you should NEVER EVER attempt to help. This is cemented by an historical case where a poor guy helped a random old lady up on the street who then turned around accused the guy and demanded compensation. The courts ruled in the old lady's favor because ""why would you help her if you did not push her?""

We were on the streets when, and you guessed it, we saw an old man on the ground. I quickly tried herding my friends away, but some of them wanted to go help, especially because they saw passerbys walking like the old man is invisible. I explained to them the story and how as their host I'm responsible for their wellbeing, and most got it. But one of my friends was still grumbling about how heartless I was. I thought I managed to get the group going, but she ran back when I was not watching and decided to help the old man. And what everyone expected to happen, happened.

It was a hassle, the old man claimed all sorts of made-up injuries and asked for about 1400 USD. We had to call the police, who suggested we just pay the old man because he is old, or we might need to open a case and that old man will need to go to the hospital to do checkup, which might get us larger fees since he seemed the type that ""knows"" the doctor. They seem keen on not opening a case even though it very much reached the monetary limit for one, making it very clear to my friend how much trouble it would cause her if they did. In the end, my friend caved to pressure and agreed to pay up.

Here's where I may be the asshole: she asked if we can all help with the money, especially me since she is not rich at all, doesn't want to be penniless in a foreign country, is not familiar with the payment systems while I'm the host and is responsible for her. I refused, for myself and low-key for everyone else when I said Im responsible for your wellbeing, but not your stupidity. In the end the old man took us to an ATM and she paid by herself, and there was barely any money left in her account. I figure it should be fine because we were staying at my house so she gets free breakfast and dinner, and she bought her return ticket before. Many of the activities we planned (like visiting malls and parks) are free, but she stay holed up in my room the entire rest of the trip and refused to talk to any of us, only cryptically posting on her Insta. They are all back home now. The rest of my friends think it's not my fault, but her parents recently texted me to tell me how bad a host I was. So AITA? Should I have helped her pay?

Edit: To all who are curious, here is the original [*case*.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xu_Shoulan_v._Peng_Yu) It said he admits pushing the woman, but in general, I think most people here knows that there are a lot of ways for people to be made to admit, especially when the authorities think its a matter of saving face/ doing it for the public good. While I do very much like my culture (I think we have objectively the best food in the world lol), we also have a lot going on, and a lot to improve.

I’m scheduled for vacation in roughly a month and wanted to visit family out of state that I have never personally visited they have been here multiple times over the years. This is the first time I’ve actually had vacation time to go and visit in the past 10 years. My gf got pissed when I said I wanted to go by myself and thinks because I have a dick I’m going to fuck everyone I meet nooooo that’s family just ridiculous right. For context also she went to visit family for 2 weeks earlier this year I even paid for half the trip and gave spending money. I had to have the trust that she wouldn’t do anything with her ex that lives there however that trust can’t be reciprocated due to her past experiences.

Reddit I need your help am I the asshole in this situation? I’m scheduled for vacation in roughly a month and wanted to visit family out of state that I have never personally visited they have been here multiple times over the years. This is the first time I’ve actually had vacation time to go and visit in the past 10 years. My gf got pissed when I said I wanted to go by myself and thinks because I have a dick I’m going to fuck everyone I meet nooooo that’s family just ridiculous right. For context also she went to visit family for 2 weeks earlier this year I even paid for half the trip and gave spending money. I had to have the trust that she wouldn’t do anything with her ex that lives there however that trust can’t be reciprocated due to her past experiences.

Hospital A is maybe 3 minutes less of a drive and is a large hospital whereas hospital B is smaller, however still good.

My neighbour is pregnant and yesterday she knocked on my door, saying she had complications and needed to go to the hospital but was unable to drive herself. I said of course, I was almost ready to leave for work and hospital B is on the way (a 4 minute detour). She told me that she needed to go to hospital A and I said sorry, but I'm already cutting it close to being late and that hospital A would be a 30 minute detour, otherwise I could call her an ambulance and get our other neighbour (elderly, without a license) to stay with her. Neighbour said she didn't have ambulance cover and reiterated that she needed to go to hospital A.

I apologized, said that I could not do that and after some back and forth I ended up leaving without her.

When I returned home from work I copped an earful from my neighbour's boyfriend saying that I'm lucky her complications weren't that serious.

I should also add, it's not a matter of hospital A being her primary care for her pregnancy, for that she goes to hospital C. She didn't want to go to hospital B because it is smaller.

tldr - I didn't give my neighbour a ride in an emergency because she wouldn't compromise and consider my own needs for being at work on time.

Edit: I was hoping not to have to explain my line of work but it turns out it is important in this context. I'm a support worker, I support clients living with disabilities to attend their own appointments, keep their routines etc. so if I was late to work, this would have an impact on the people I work with.

93,1eddksw,AITA for coming out to my mother (44F) ,"Well I came out and un-came out I guess. So I had gone home for summer holidays from college. My mental health was really struggling. So I was telling my mom I won't marry and all. And after some time she started crying and asked why. So I told her, how their marriage had failed(mom and dad) and I didn't wanna go through it. Then like a dam breaking loose I started crying and all my thoughts started pouring out. And in a desperate moment, I blurted that I am bi. My mom physically retracted me from her embrace and then asked, ""what, how, when?"" Etc. So I just told her, ""I've always known"". Then she tried to explain to me it's all in my head, I don't like men, etc etc. So I just went in my room and locked the door. Then, dad came home. He saw mom crying still( it had been 2 hrs). He asked me why she was crying and I told him. He told me there's nothing like that. I am confused. Then I just left them at that and went to my room even though I tried explaining what it meant and all. The next day, I again see my mom crying, and I can't take it anymore( my mom has raised me very lovingly, in a very very abusive environment), I asked her, ""why she was crying?"". So she tells me that "" She always wanted a daughter(As in my wife would be her daughter) and what if I marry a guy and all"". So I told her, ""That we'll cross the bridge when it comes and she shouldn't be concerned about it now"". But she kept repeating the same thing so I just promised her "" I won't marry a guy every for your happiness"". And she was all happy and jumped. She even said that ""I'll marry the girl she picks for me"". AITA ? 

For context - Ok, so I live in a country/region, where no-one actually leaves their family completely. Also I love my mom a alot.

Yes they do pay for my college, (here you don't start to earn, until after your bachelor's). Also we have a lot of festive holidays so going home is quite common as well.

94,1eddasf,WIBTA if I stop my volunteering because of new coordinator? ,"Hi, I (30F) am a volunteer for an NGO that helps kids in Africa to get an education. I have volunteered with the NGO for about 5 years. I volunteer about 3-5 hours a week while working full-time in a hospital (I am a neurologist). I know it is not much, but I used to like it. 

Lately, I am getting annoyed and pissed. The NGO offers you children for ""long-distance adoption"" and when you adopt you pay for their education and optionally for their health insurance. it is not a small amount it is about 1000 EUR a year.  Well, the problem started when this new coordinator started working there 3-4 months ago. First, she started to bitch me, that she does not like how I write my emails to the adoptive parents, I should make them look prettier and add some ""fluff"". 

But the real buzz killer came when I was writing emails about ending the adoptions and when there was some money left, I offered to return the money to the adoptive parent. She went through several of my emails and told me off for offering their money back. She told me I should try to keep the money at the NGO and try to make them adopt another child (which is years and years long commitment) and return the money only in case they actively ask for it and even in that case I should try to promote other kids. This does not sit right with me at all. These people are kind enough to support a child they have never seen with not a small amount of money over the years and it feels wrong to pressure them to give more if they don't offer by themselves. I always point out the option of adopting another child or making a one-time donation in the final letter/email, but if they want their money back, it's their money. And I really don't like to try to squeeze them for more.

Well she keeps controlling my emails and letters to the parents and pestering me about it not being pretty enough written and ""selling"" enough. So I am thinking about quitting working for this particular NGO even though I like it and I have adopted a child myself.

95,1edd6vr,AITA for passing on giving a toast at my dad's wedding?,"My dad is getting married for the first time in two months and I (23m) was supposed to give a toast to him and his fiancée Rose. But I'm having a hard time writing it because I can talk about how much I love my dad, how happy I am for him, how amazing he is as a dad and how I'm glad he found someone. But I don't like Rose and I can't find anything good to say that doesn't directly link to my dad. Like she makes him happy. She's good to him, etc. Those things I can say. But I find her annoying, she bugs me calling me her son and she knows it too because I communicated with her about it. I hate the way she gives pity for me growing up with just a dad, my dad was a single dad by choice, and how she talks like I always longed for a mom even though my dad and I, and my family, have told her it's just not true. She's also very affectionate and expects me to return it which I don't feel comfortable doing.

I find her intrusive also. She showed up at my apartment (rented with friends) and tried to invite herself in while I was out. My friends told her to call back when I was there. They know how I feel about her. But she told them she just wanted to come in and wait for me because she wanted some mom and son time. They had to call me because she was persistent about staying. Dad and her talked and she apologized but she tried to drop by unannounced and uninvited after that too. But she did leave when asked to the next time. She has also asked a bunch of questions about my coming out as gay.

My dad loves her, my family mostly likes her--with a couple of exceptions.

I just couldn't gush or praise her for being her. Only for her being a partner to my dad. While my dad I can easily express love for.

I told my dad. He was cool with it. I'm shy so he understood it was always going to be uneasy anyway. But Rose told me she was so excited to hear me speak and they wanted me to toast them because I'm the VIP after them. My aunt confronted me over not doing it too because she knows I don't really like Rose... She said it was selfish for me to make it so clear by not giving the toast.

96,1edck8z,AITA for telling my mom she and her husband need to admit they fucked up and find a way to move on?,"My parents divorced when I (18m) was 6. My younger sister was 4 and my younger brother was 3. They shared custody 50/50 of us ever since, though now I don't have a custody thing set up because I'm an adult now and no longer part of any of that. I stay with my dad now.

Mom remarried when I was 11 and my siblings were 9 and 8. Her husband was divorced, had two kids who were 8 and 6. He had primary custody of them but in the summer they'd get longer with their mom. My mom and her husband moved in together a month before the wedding. From that point on they created these really strict, really weird, and really crazy rules that basically made sure we were never a blended family and there was always animosity.

Those rules were;   
If you want permission for something, ask your ""new parent"", not the regular one  
No bio siblings only playing, everyone has to mix  
No closed bedroom doors. We wanna see if you're mixing  
Every day you'll tell the people in the family one thing you love about them  
You must give everyone hugs before leaving the house  
No step/half nonsense in this house

There were others. Those were the most damaging ones. My mom told me she wanted us to be a happy blended family and she did not want favoritism of parents or siblings. She told me I didn't just have a brother and sister anymore, I had two of each. I also had a ""second dad"".

They enforced this too, or tried to. The hugs never took off and I never ever told her husband or his kids stuff I loved about them. I never loved them to begin with.

The rules led to fighting, to us pretty much causing chaos if they took us places. We were all grounded pretty much all the time at their house. We also started doing stuff to make sure family vacations couldn't happen together. Her husband's kids would make plans with their mom to go to her weeks he and mom had a vacation booked for. My siblings and I would ask dad to book his vacation first and put it in their app. 

My mom and her husband would get so frustrated and they'd try giving us these talks. Mom would come to me and say I was the oldest and needed to set an example. And now that I no longer go to mom's house, my siblings don't want to either and make a bigger deal out of it. Mom called me yesterday and told me I needed to help create the family unit they fought so hard for before it's too late. She mentioned me being the oldest again and how I should be there for a week when we can all be a family. I told her no, I don't want to, and we're not a family. I told her they fucked up. They need to admit it and they need to find a way forward because none of the kids they set so many rules for want to be family.

We are on vacation taking our kids to visit her nephews. The relevant parts are that there are 5 kids ranging in ages from 9 to 16. The 12 year old (my wife's nephew) is the one I ""snapped at."" I rented a large home so everyone could stay together. I had tried to redirect his negative behavior until it kept getting worse and worse. I'll explain what I tried

On the first day, he opened the car door while I was driving over 55mph. I laughed it, joked that shouldn't happen, and child locked the doors

On the second day, it was his constant complaining that we weren't all doing the activities that he wanted to do - specifically that he wanted to play pickleball. I tried to explain, as an adult and without anger, that we flew thousands of miles and planned this trip specifically to a national park to see this area. We have a separate part of our vacation for games and hanging out like that. He still pouted and complained, so I (and I think I'm about 80% the asshole for this, had all of us do an extra 1 mile hike for the day- side note everyone including him actually enjoyed that hike the most but it was still wrong of me). 

On the third day, we were all cleaning the house to leave. I heard him ask my son (9 y/o) if he wanted to go wait in the car. My son told him,  ""why? So you don't have to help clean? That's messed up."" I did not say anything and just looked at the two. A bit later, my wife asked him to help the other kids clean. He flat ignored her and stayed on his iPad.

Later that day, we all went to a lake. He was skipping stones. Eventually he ended up skipping them near people. My wife told him to stop, that he needed to either stand on the other side of them or throw them in a different direction. He argued with her that he didn't need to because he had good aim. I interjected and told him ""your aunt asked you to. That should be good enough. Nobody wants rocks thrown near them."" And he threw them in a different direction for about 10 minutes. Then he threw them right near the other people again. So I stopped him, and told him off in a loud voice. Basically I told him ""your aunt told you not to do something and you did it anyways? Why is that? Do you think it's funny? Do you like me yelling at you in front of everyone? Would you like me to force you to go up to that couple and apologize? Do you think people want random rocks thrown near them? Get it together."" More or less. 

My wife thinks I'm way in the wrong because in her opinion, it's not my place to discipline her cousins kid. In my opinion,  I'm the aggrieved because I informed my wife's cousin (the child's mother) of all these events after they happened and she did nothing to prevent the escalation. I think this might be a cultural issue as well, as to me it seems quite normal for any family member to discipline a child.

Please let me know your thoughts, as I am not closed to changing my heart on the matter.  ",0.0,0.9878912568092346,1,0

He was my childhood neighbour and kind of a friend until we hooked up around 6 years ago by his iniciative. He behaved really bad towards me, once when we were in the middle of a physical interaction he stopped and told me he wasn't attracted to me (wtf) just to days and months later keep pursuing me. 

Anyway, as he was horrible towards me I just ended things for good, kept being polite because our families are really close but that was it, I moved overseas and he got a girl pregnant and then married her.

Last month he contacted me and asked me if I could treat his wife because she has kidney issues. I have not being working as a clinical nutritionist for 5 years, since I focused on food industry so I'm not updated on the matter so I told him I can't, specially because in those cases I believe is important to personally evaluate the patient and I'm in another country. 

I know I was capable of doing it remotely because even when I'm not updated I do know how and where to look for the info, but tbh I wouldn't feel comfortable because It's not longer my job and I would do a favor to someone that wasn't nice to me and hurt me.

I'm just done with being nice toward people that hurt me, but I know his wife is not responsible for his actions. I was a little afraid because her health issue is quite serious and if something went wrong they could think I did something out of revenge.

102,1edb9xs,AITA for Canceling My Friend’s Birthday Plans Last Minute?,"
Last weekend was supposed to be a fun celebration for my good friend, who was turning 25. She had been planning her birthday party for months, organizing everything from the venue to the guest list. We had a group chat where she shared updates and asked for input on the decorations and food. I was excited and even offered to help with some of the planning.

However, two days before the party, I got an invitation to a concert featuring one of my favorite bands. The concert was a rare event and the tickets were limited, so I jumped at the chance to go. The problem was that the concert was scheduled for the same night as her birthday party.

I hesitated for a moment, but my desire to see the band overshadowed my loyalty to my friend. I texted her saying I couldn’t make it to her party because I had a ""family commitment"" (a lie) and bought the concert tickets. I felt guilty but justified it by thinking that she would have plenty of other friends there and could still have a great time without me.

The day of the party, I posted a few pictures from the concert on social media, and that’s when she saw them. She texted me, clearly hurt, asking why I hadn’t been honest about my plans. I panicked and tried to explain myself, but she was understandably upset. She felt betrayed that I chose a concert over her milestone birthday.

Now, I’m wondering if I’m the asshole for canceling on her last minute and lying about my reasons. I know I should have been upfront, but the concert was such a big deal to me. AITA?",Asshole,2024-07-27,"AITA for Canceling My Friend’s Birthday Plans Last Minute?

He wakes up earlier than me and goes to sleep after me so he gets a couple hours alone in the morning and sometimes at night. We both work from home so we’re with each other all day everyday. Usually I’m okay and it doesn’t bother me but as of lately he wants to vent about his family stuff non-stop. It’s to the point where he does it if I’m working with headphones on, if I’m on the toilet, if I’m in the shower, exercising, or even if we’re watching tv together he’ll just start venting and then I’m left scrambling looking for the remote to pause it and eventually go back to rewind to figure out where we left off. 

The issues with his family isn’t new nor is it life or death but it bothers him understandably. I try to listen and to engage so it’s not so draining for me but it’s getting to be too much to me. I feel like I have no time to process my own thoughts, feelings, or emotions anymore. I’ll have opportunities to vent about little things like my friends, work, or my own family stuff, but it doesn’t last all day and usually only happens if something big comes up. He’ll show me something that happened at 10 AM and still be talking about it 10 PM. There are brakes in between but it’s very consuming to our relationship. 

Today after work I took a nap and woke up and we started watching tv and he talked over the whole show to vent. I tried to engage with him and started asking I wonder why that happens. He then stated that he’s not feeling supported when I ask questions like that and it’s obvious I’m not trying to engage.  I told him I was feeling overstimulated and it’s almost 11 pm.

108,1ed91u5,AITA for telling my sister to tell our parents she’s pregnant?,"A few nights ago, I went to my younger sister and I told her that I think that we should talk to our mother within the next few days as she’s currently 5 months pregnant and still keeping it a secret. I had previously spoken to her about 4 weeks ago and told her she should try telling our parents (or we can talk to our mother together/get the baby daddy’s mother to talk to our parents) by the end of July so I thought it wouldn’t be bad to ask her again. I had been giving her time at first (I’ve known since she was 2 months) but she’s so close to her due date and hasn’t even been referred to maternity and she just stays in her room all day and never leaves.

I genuinely wasn’t coming from a place of malice but she tends to take anything I say negatively. I had been paying for her appointments initially but she hasn’t been going anymore and I’ve reminded her that the health of her and her baby are so important so so she needs her maternity checkups. There’s only much I can do for her with my limited financial capabilities and lack of knowledge for this and I kept telling her that the only way I can help her is if our parents are aware of it too.

She got mad saying that it’s none of my business (even tho I’m the one that has to cover her financially as she’s not working) and that I don’t care for anyone but myself which is why I keep trying to get her to talk to mom about it without giving her time and not taking her circumstances into consideration. 

Mind you, people already know, including the baby daddy’s family. She even told people about wanting to have a baby shower (but I would end up covering all the expenses). My other sibling even found out from another person at her youth group and I kept reminding her that it’s a matter of time before someone accidentally tells our parents. And it’ll be so much worse if they could out from outside sources.

I understand and sympathize where she’s coming from but I got upset at the time and told her that if I never said any of this to her and left her to do her own thing, in the future she’ll come back and get mad at me for not telling her/not caring for her (She has done this multiple times in the past. She involves me into a problem, tells me to fuck off then gets mad when I actually do and it doesn’t go her way). She immediately got mad and told me that since I don’t give a shit about anyone but myself she’ll tell them now. She took her ultrasounds, stormed out, threw them at my parents and walked away. 

PS: I’ll be completely honest, the day I heard my sister was pregnant, I didn’t mind. When she told me who the father was, my heart dropped and I still feel faint when I think of it to this day. Her baby daddy is her friend that attempted to sexually harass me in the past (in our own house no less.) My sister is VERY aware of this and she still sneaks him into our house knowing how uncomfortable he makes me.
",Not the A-hole,2024-07-27,"AITA for telling my sister to tell our parents she’s pregnant? A few nights ago, I went to my younger sister and I told her that I think that we should talk to our mother within the next few days as she’s currently 5 months pregnant and still keeping it a secret. I had previously spoken to her about 4 weeks ago and told her she should try telling our parents (or we can talk to our mother together/get the baby daddy’s mother to talk to our parents) by the end of July so I thought it wouldn’t be bad to ask her again. I had been giving her time at first (I’ve known since she was 2 months) but she’s so close to her due date and hasn’t even been referred to maternity and she just stays in her room all day and never leaves.

I genuinely wasn’t coming from a place of malice but she tends to take anything I say negatively. I had been paying for her appointments initially but she hasn’t been going anymore and I’ve reminded her that the health of her and her baby are so important so so she needs her maternity checkups. There’s only much I can do for her with my limited financial capabilities and lack of knowledge for this and I kept telling her that the only way I can help her is if our parents are aware of it too.

She got mad saying that it’s none of my business (even tho I’m the one that has to cover her financially as she’s not working) and that I don’t care for anyone but myself which is why I keep trying to get her to talk to mom about it without giving her time and not taking her circumstances into consideration. 

Mind you, people already know, including the baby daddy’s family. She even told people about wanting to have a baby shower (but I would end up covering all the expenses). My other sibling even found out from another person at her youth group and I kept reminding her that it’s a matter of time before someone accidentally tells our parents. And it’ll be so much worse if they could out from outside sources.

I understand and sympathize where she’s coming from but I got upset at the time and told her that if I never said any of this to her and left her to do her own thing, in the future she’ll come back and get mad at me for not telling her/not caring for her (She has done this multiple times in the past. She involves me into a problem, tells me to fuck off then gets mad when I actually do and it doesn’t go her way). She immediately got mad and told me that since I don’t give a shit about anyone but myself she’ll tell them now. She took her ultrasounds, stormed out, threw them at my parents and walked away. 

PS: I’ll be completely honest, the day I heard my sister was pregnant, I didn’t mind. When she told me who the father was, my heart dropped and I still feel faint when I think of it to this day. Her baby daddy is her friend that attempted to sexually harass me in the past (in our own house no less.) My sister is VERY aware of this and she still sneaks him into our house knowing how uncomfortable he makes me.

""NOT the response I should’ve been receiving for either of those messages""
Then i said, ""I'm not gonna act like my response was the sweetest most heartfelt think I could've come up with, but at the end of the day I really don't owe you any specific kind of response""
I'm beginning to feel guilty for the way I'm acting and I'm wondering if it really is justified.

110,1ed8nxt,AITA for telling a guy my friend thinks he's cute at a bar?,"Went out for dinner last night with my(29m) partner(26f) and her friend(26f) but first we met up and had a glass of wine at the friends house.

The entire evening the conversation circled around the friends romantic life and her quest in trying to meet someone.

She had gotten out of a toxic one-off relationship with a ""alpha""-bootcamp style guy and now had a checklist of the guy she wanted to meet: cute, over 30, black (she's mixed if that matters), local (not tourist or on a visa), drivers license, well-paid, drives his own car and some other small stuff.

Overall I think she's quite shallow and feel like she could put some more effort into her own life instead of ""leeching"" (this was the term that she used to describe herself in any relationship in a fun way I guess) of someone else's but whatever, it's a close friend of my partners and I 'm not looking for trouble.

We have dinner at one place and then go for drinks at a bar just around the corner where there's a good vibe.

The entire conversation was non-stop about her finding someone, how we could create a Netflix style reality show for her to choose a guy, and what format it should have, different dating techniques used today etc.

Then she points over at a guy who apparently she thinks fits all the criteriea and seems interested in her also.

I get a piece of paper and a pen and asks if she wants to write down some digits and me or my partner can go drop it off at his table (he is by himself just giving to the live music), she says she doesn't want that because she wants the guy to be the one to approach her.

A half hour goes by and the talk is about how cute he is, and I can't wrap my head around how much easier it would be to just be a bit upfront and stop caring about all these self imposed rules so when the guy all of a sudden walks by behind me I turn to him, taps his arm and says ""hey man, my friend thinks you're cute you know"".

The girls are in shock, the dude is smiling, and says something in a language I don't understand and goes back to his table.

I felt bad thinking he rejected her and the friend gets really upset saying I was really immature and a horrible wingman.

The guy then comes back but the girls say that we must leave.

Apparently he thought she was cute and came back to get to know her but up close she wasn't as attracted to him. She also found out he wasn't local so there goes two criteria.

Personally I feel like it was a home run as she didn't know these two deal breakers until he was up close, but how was anyone meant to know that until they got talking.

The dude clearly appreciated being complimented (as I figured since I remember how nice that clarity is when you're engaging with new people) and yet I'm being called immature, rude, bad friend etc.

I get that I lost my cool and went a bit rouge but after 3 hours of non-stop talking about the same subject I felt like maybe life can just happen, you never know and it's similar to how I met my partner of 6 years.

112,1ed8cfc,AITA for not housesitting?,"Background: I am in the US for an internship together with a person we’ll call B. We said we’d find housing together but our boss knew a couple who would let us stay in a small room at their house for 100$/month. B said that was too small to stay in for both of us, but that SHE didn’t want to continue looking since it was too much work and too expensive. I got the hint, she took the room, I continued looking, and after ALOT of effort I found a room in an apartment with 3 roommates for 900$. This turned out to be a lifesaver, not only because of my roommates who I love, or the pool in the building - but because of B.

I find it really hard to be around her. Examples: B told me she wanted to get a US bank account. I did not at first but then reconsidered it, I asked her if she had gotten one. B said  ”No, I will see how much work it is for you to get it first, and if it isn’t too much work I will do it too”. We went to NYC, she picked a pizza place and bought a 40$ pizza, then complained the whole night that it was expensive, and wanted to blow off the stand up I had booked for us to go back to the hotel to put the pizza in the fridge. When our colleague drove us to a hike she kept asked him much it costs to live there, how rich they are, and said that the houses were ugly. When we went over to the other state side she asked if they were poor, that it looked like they were. B complains constantly that the couple expects her to talk with them, that her rent is expensive, and that everything is expensive in the US (she pays for one meal a week, they cook for her for free the remaining days)

Now, every summer the interns housesit the boss’s house. My friend was excited about this since she doesn’t like the couple, and will pay 100$ less in rent since she won’t be living in their room for that week. I said that I could stay sunday night so that we could drive into work together for the first day (she had said she wanted me to drive in the us since she thinks driving is scary and dangerous here). We were discussing what we were going to do after we had dropped the boss off at the airport. She said she didn’t want to drop me off since that would be a longer drive, so I said I then might take the metro directly from the airport which takes 2 hours home. She then asked me if I was going to stay at the house on the weekdays. I said no, that I was going to stay at my apartment room. She got upset, and said that we agreed to housesit together, and that I am leaving her to do all the work (chores consist of emptying out a leafpicking robot from the pool, bringing in the mail, and watering the plants). I said that I had told her that I would only stay over the first day, but that I could come in and do the chores in that case, but she got more upset and said that she thought this was something we would do together.

113,1ed85mu,AITA for calling my friend an insensitive b**ch?,"about a week ago, i wanted to relive my childhood by hosting a stuffed animal wedding. i decided to make up names, make a wedding slide show, etc for the faux wedding.

i started by making a guest list with names for every stuffed animal attending, each customized like a unicorn named uniella hornika, you get the vibe. i then took pictures of when the ""bride"" and ""groom"" met, turning them into one of those wedding slide shows. i also made fake food, putting together a seafood menu. i then found an AI speech program to make faux wedding speeches from the guests, bride, and groom.

as you can see, i put a lot of effort into it, and was really excited to host it. i then invited 3 of my friends to join a call with me at a specific time to witness the wedding. all three agreed (which is impoetant), and i was super hyped up.

once the time came, i hosted the call, and 2 joined, but 1 didn't. i didn't really mind because it was just one person, and asked my two friends, who we'll call sara and mia to mute their mics. i began to start the wedding, and it was going pretty well until sara began goofing off. she unmuted and began talking loudly and yelling whilst mia chuckled with her mic off. i told her to mute again, which she did, but she put on a memoji head to joke around. i told her to just turn her camera off, and she said ""f*** you"" out of spite, while mia continued to laugh. i had both girls turn their cameras off, and sara didn't interact for the rest of the call, even if i said she could unmute.

at the end of the wedding, i asked what their favorite part was when mia admitted to me that she scrolled on pinterest the whole time. i was obviously hurt and asked sara if she had done the same, to which she left the call.

a few days later, after i cooled down, i confronted sara about it, asking her why she did that. sara told me that the wedding had just been boring and she was bored. when i asked her why she bothered to come she said ""i don't know, i thought it would hurt your feelings if i didn't."" i told her it hurt my feelings more when she did come and didn't pay attention. sara then began getting mad at me, asking me why i didn't get mad at mia too if it was such a big deal (i had already told mia she hurt my feelings the day of the ""wedding""), to which i told her i did. sara then dropped the bombshell, saying that she really didn't care about other people's feelings, and i told her she needs to work on that. sara told me she doesn't want to, and i told her she's being an insensitive b**ch. sara obviously got mad and asked me how, to which i told her she's not just accepting she was in the wrong and can't apologize. sara told me she didn't care and hung up the phone. she then told mia, who was uncomfortable being caught between our fights, so i refused to drag her in.

114,1ed82js,AITA for refusing a gift from my grandma?,"So my(25F) grandma is in town for the weekend to see my brother's(19M) play. She just got in today, and I went over to my parents' house to see her. I love my grandma a lot. She's generally not problematic. However, the past couple of years she's been very obsessed with the fact that I sweat. Now, I don't sweat profusely or anything like that. I sweat when it's hot outside and/or I do something physical like running. Basically, I sweat like a normal person, and I wear deodorant. She's the only person who's ever said anything to me, so I don't think it's me being blind to a problem.

A few years ago, when I lived closer to her while going to college she made a comment about me sweating and how she used to have a sweating problem, too. She got me some extra strength roll on (wet) deodorant/antiperspirant that was supposed to help me not sweat as much. I haven't really used it at all because I don't like the wet roll on kind of deodorants. I've tried them before, and they make my arms feel nasty. I've only used it if I've forgotten deodorant because it's just perpetually in my suitcase.

Now tonight, she got home from the airport and was playing with my dog when she said she had a gift for me. She goes to her suitcase and pulls out these cotton pad things. They're sweat pads for under your arms. I have sensory issues sometimes, and there are certain things that don't sit well with me, and I knew that these wouldn't. I also don't want her to just think of me as the sweaty granddaughter. So I said, ""I appreciate the thought, but I won't wear these."" She was disappointed and tried to convince me to try it. I told her no again, and that sweating is a natural human response to heat and is how we cool down. It's also not that big of a problem. Then when she and my mom were talking she said, ""OP didn't like my gift."" Thankfully, my mom backed me up and said that I don't have to like it.

I know my grandma isn't trying to be mean or anything, but the only time I feel self-conscious about sweating is when she brings it up to me. Other than that, I am perfectly happy (at least in that regard). She didn't say that I was an AH because she would never use that language, but she was clearly taken aback and wants me to change my mind. Usually I would just accept a gift even if I didn't plan to use it, but I don't want this to continue.

She's generally not problematic. However, the past couple of years she's been very obsessed with the fact that I sweat. Now, I don't sweat profusely or anything like that. I sweat when it's hot outside and/or I do something physical like running. Basically, I sweat like a normal person, and I wear deodorant. She's the only person who's ever said anything to me, so I don't think it's me being blind to a problem.

A few years ago, when I lived closer to her while going to college she made a comment about me sweating and how she used to have a sweating problem, too. She got me some extra strength roll on (wet) deodorant/antiperspirant that was supposed to help me not sweat as much. I haven't really used it at all because I don't like the wet roll on kind of deodorants. I've tried them before, and they make my arms feel nasty. I've only used it if I've forgotten deodorant because it's just perpetually in my suitcase.

Now tonight, she got home from the airport and was playing with my dog when she said she had a gift for me. She goes to her suitcase and pulls out these cotton pad things. They're sweat pads for under your arms. I have sensory issues sometimes, and there are certain things that don't sit well with me, and I knew that these wouldn't. I also don't want her to just think of me as the sweaty granddaughter. So I said, ""I appreciate the thought, but I won't wear these."" She was disappointed and tried to convince me to try it. I told her no again, and that sweating is a natural human response to heat and is how we cool down. It's also not that big of a problem. Then when she and my mom were talking she said, ""OP didn't like my gift."" Thankfully, my mom backed me up and said that I don't have to like it.

I know my grandma isn't trying to be mean or anything, but the only time I feel self-conscious about sweating is when she brings it up to me. Other than that, I am perfectly happy (at least in that regard). She didn't say that I was an AH because she would never use that language, but she was clearly taken aback and wants me to change my mind. Usually I would just accept a gift even if I didn't plan to use it, but I don't want this to continue. So AITA for saying no to my grandma after she bought me sweat pads?",0.0,0.04013102501630783,0,1
115,1ed7uye,AITA for being mad about the way my friend is planning my bday party?,"A few weeks ago I (20 F) and my close friend (21 F) were discussing my upcoming birthday.

When I spoke to her today she told me that she would text tonight, but, since it's 12:00am, I am assuming that's not happening. I'm getting frustrated that nothing has been planned, especially since my birthday is on a Saturday and I'm worried we won't be able to get a dinner reservation or that my friends may have made other plans by now.

116,1ed7a5r,AITA For helping my friend finish moving in w/o him knowing?,"My(28f) friend (28M) just moved down the street from me. Weve been close for years, have seen each other through college relationships, family drama, etc. In recent years, weve gotten super close. (Before you ask, hes gay.)

In the past few months, hes really been going through it emotionally and physically. Various small but annoying medical problems, working three parttime jobs, moving to a place he can barely afford and the like. He also has ADHD and anxiety and cant afford therapy/medicine to help things. He is very much raw dogging life.

As I mentioned he recently moved to a duplex down the street from me, been there about a month. I was there along with a few friends to help move so Ive already seen the place and talked with him about future interior design plans, including a furniture wish list. In that month, nothing has changed. His jobs and mental health are shitting on his motivation and ability to do more than the basics. He doesn't even have a mattress, just sleeps on the floor with blankets.

This week hes out of town for a few days so we hatched a plan. I volunteered to plant sit for him. The two friends and I would then sneak in to place new + thrifted furniture, clean, and get him some basics. About 90% of the way through, I texted him to call me before he gets home. (I wanted to give him a heads up before just walking in and seeing things different.) Well anxiety made him call me right then and ask whats wrong. I confessed our shenanigans and he was...less than pleased.

He said it was a sweet idea but he felt betrayed we went through his stuff. I promised him we didn't go through anything-- not unpacking a single thing, just moving a box out of the way-- but I dont think he believes me. Or maybe hes just plain hurt? Idk.

i (F, 19) have been in a relationship with leo (M, 23) for 6 months now. i became homeless, and he allowed me to move in with him after a month of dating which i am so grateful for. when we moved in, we started having small arguments, avoidable ones. 

 my homelessness was caused by a family breakdown. this really took a toll on my mental health. leo told me i should always talk to him about my problems, and he would be here to listen. one night, i was upset and had a panic attack. it was 12am. he asked me what the problem was. it took me some time to calm down but i said i was upset with my current family situation. he got angry at me and said that i shouldn’t tell him at night time and that he had been waiting for ages so my panic attack finished so he could find out the problem. he switched off the light, and went to bed. this happened a week later when i was upset again in the evening. i tried to hide it but he could kd tell something was wrong. i withheld from telling him due to his reaction last time, and told him i’d tell him in the morning, to which he got angry at and said that its annoying and he wants to help but i’m not telling him, and was yet again, angry that i was upset at night. this happened once again, when he was showing me his phone and a message popped up from his ex, who he said he hadn’t spoken to for months. he told me he accidentally sent her a tiktok and she tried to reach out but he told her he didn’t want to speak to her, and showed me those messages. whilst i was happy that he shot her down, something felt off. i was very upset when going to bed. he asked me what was wrong, but because of his reaction to telling him my problems at night time, i withheld telling him what was wrong and said i was fine. he told me that i was shaking and that i clearly wasn’t. i finally told him that i was just upset about earlier and unsure and he got mad at me and said that he already explained he sent the tiktok accidentally, and he hadn’t spoken to her at all since we started dating. he got mad at me once again for bringing it up before bed time, and turned away from me the rest of the night. soon, i found out that he had lied, and was texting her during our relationship. it was all platonic, they were just catching up and whatnot, apart from one message, where he sent her a tiktok which said “seeing horny tiktoks but not sending it to each other 🤝” to which the conversation just was them laughing about how funny the tiktok was. i confronted him about this and he cried, apologised profusely and said he only hid it because he didn’t want me to get the wrong idea, and that he only wanted to date me. and he was only angry because he wanted me to go to bed, and he didn’t want his sleep disrupted. am i the asshole?

119,1ed6zui,"AITA for laughing in my cousin's face when she tried to stage an intervention for my ""drug use?""","I (27M) have a condition which causes me to overproduce earwax. I don't tell people about it because I was bullied for it growing up. Only my wife and parents know. Every other day, I have to put medication in each ear, let it sit, then flush it out with a rubber tipped syringe. This prevents ear infections, vertigo, permanent hearing loss, and worsening of my tinnitus. I have dealt with all of these things to some extent, so I stay on top of my eardrop regimen. If my alarm goes off when I'm with others, I go to the bathroom for 20 minutes and knock it out. If I don't follow my schedule I forget, so I can't put it off. 

Two weeks ago, my mom hosted family dinner. My cousin Kara (37F) saw me waltz off to the bathroom to do my thing, syringe in hand, and asked what I was doing. I said just a minor medical thing. She kept pushing but I didn't want to say anything because she gossips. I told her it's personal and scooted past. When I left, she was standing in the hallway. She asked what took so long and why the toilet didn't flush. I said none of her business. She said she didn't mean to offend. 

Last weekend, my friend called me to invite me out to lunch with some buddies. He said  to meet up at his house so we wouldn't have to drive separately. I arrive at his house to find Kara and my friends sitting solemnly on the couch. Kara said they were here to talk about my ""problem"" and that they just wanted to help. I said there is no problem. Suddenly it clicked in my head what this was about. I couldn't help but laugh a little bit out of shock. She asked what was so funny, and I said first of all why didn't you talk to my wife or my parents? She said she didn't want to involve my ""enablers"" which just made me laugh harder. She looked annoyed and said she was done trying to help. I said that's alright by me She stormed out. 

I explained to my friends. They knew I have a condition but never pressed me on it, I guess when Kara approached them they thought I was lying. Obviously I'd rather they know than worry about me being an addict when l'm not. I thanked them for their support anyways. Kara had apparently reached all of my friends by through my social media. We all got a good hearty laugh out of it, which Kara must have heard because she was, of course, eavesdropping. She burst back in and told me to tell them the truth, to which I said I did. My friend kicked her out. We went for lunch and I thought that was that. 

My mom called me yesterday and told me she had talked to Kara about the whole thing and explained. She said Kara was very upset with me and essentially called me an asshole for not explaining, and laughing in her face and embarrassing her. I said I was embarrassed and that Kara had no right to my info. I think she shouldn't go around snooping and making assumptions. My mom still thinks I should apologize.

Anyway my girlfriend (19F) came over while i was playing and she sees me playing all the time so she naturally got interested and wanted to play too, so she asked if she can play, i said alright and i gave her my spare controller and went into a regular kickoff match. 

We start playing and obviously i lower my skill level since im playing someone who just started playing, so i teach her the mechanics and how to play, and after a few games she seems to get used to it and manages to score some goals and after maybe our 5th match she beats me 3-1 and starts shit talking me and claiming that shes some kind of prodigy and that i must be really trash to be playing for so long since i cant even beat someone who just started playing.

So i laugh and decide to teach her a lesson, so we play another match and i purposely go out of my way to humiliate her, using skill moves and dribbling through her team completely, sombrero flicks over her players, outside the box green timed volleys etc, bicycle kicks, finesse shots, flair shots, basically every rat move in the book.

The game ends 10-0 (i couldve gotten more but i felt bad so i cooled it down a bit), anyway i can tell shes pissed off so i laugh and say “thats why you shouldn’t talk shit to people when they try to teach you young padawan” in a joking manner obviously. She gets mad and starts cussing me out, saying how i was unfair and how she was just joking and how i was an asshole for doing that to her. I was low key shocked because i thought she’d just laugh at the whole thing because shes usually that kind of person.

Anyway she got mad and went home, and she doesnt want to talk to me and now im wondering if i went too far, AITA

EDIT: Thanks for all the replies guys, it was very enlightening and i will try to tone down this kind of behavior in the future, anyways me and my gf patched things up and we’re good now, so happy ending ig :)",Not the A-hole,2024-07-27,"AITA for destroying my gf at fifa?

123,1ed5mej,AITA for not allowing my grandma’s s friend to sleep in my bed.,"Context: Hi, I’m F17. My grandma is hosting a big house party, so things have been hectic. Her friend, ""Jessica"" (F67), is helping out. My grandma has a weird, somewhat unrequited relationship with Jessica, who is very quiet and keeps to herself. 

After work, my grandma picked me up around 9:45 pm with Jessica in the front seat. I assumed she would drop Jessica off at home, but my grandma persuaded her to stay the night. We only have one guest room, occupied by my sister, so I thought Jessica would sleep in the finished basement. 

When we got home, Jessica asked where she could sleep. My grandma pulled me aside and suggested Jessica sleep in my room, saying, ""You wouldn’t want a senior citizen sleeping on a hard couch."" I replied that I had work in the morning and needed my bed, and that if I had known earlier, I could have planned accordingly. My grandma then called me a selfish brat and is still making snarky remarks.

125,1ed4r5q,AITA For Only Paying my Step-sons bill at family dinner?,"
I (31F) have been married to my husband (35M) for two years. My step-son, who is 16, and I were invited to a family dinner by my relatives. My husband couldn’t join us due to a work commitment.

I make a good salary and sometimes cover my nephew’s and other family members’ meals at these dinners as a gesture of goodwill. However, this time, I decided to pay only for my step-son’s and my own meals. Our total came to $250. We had plans to go shopping and have a special outing just for the two of us later in the month, so I wanted to manage our expenses more carefully.

After the dinner, my sister-in-law (my nephew’s mom) complained. She accused me of favoring my step-son over my own family and said I spoil him too much. She was really upset and claimed that my actions showed I care more about my step-son than my own flesh and blood. Her comments really pissed me off. I argued back, saying that they invited us to dinner and expected me to cover everyone’s meal, which didn’t seem fair. I explained that my step-son and I have our own plans and budget, and it was unreasonable to expect me to pay for everyone.

To make matters worse, some family members had to borrow money from others just to cover their share because they felt entitled to have me pay for the entire bill. The family is now split—some are on my side, agreeing that I was justified given the situation, while others think I should have just paid for everyone and discussed it afterward. Many are shocked by the amount and said they wouldn’t have paid the bill either. They argue that it would have been more considerate to cover the entire bill at the time, given that we were all together.

126,1ed3wfa,AITA - My Kid Approached a strangers dog in our front yard,"My (33M) kid is 2 years old.  He loves playing outside and running around so usually every morning we spend some time outside.  Its hot out, so I make sure he is drinking water.  

  
This morning, I opened the door to let him run out and before I stepped out I realized I forgot to grab his water.  I let him out while I went to grab his cup. In the literal 5, maybe 10 seconds it took to grab the water and then go supervise my son I heard a dog barking and a lady yelling  

  
I rush outside and she is yelling at me to keep my son away from her dog. We do not have pets, and so dogs are something he sees from a distance. And I actually agree, it's not okay that he did that and I don't want him near dogs at this age.  I grab him as he is fairly close to the dog, he is saying ""woof"".  The lady is pulling her barking dog to her.  

  
She is laying into me that my son approaching her dog is not okay.  However, This lady let her dog wander well into my yard and well into the area that my son plays in daily.  I did not like this. I ask her what her dog is doing in my yard.  She disregards my question and lectures me that I need to supervise my son better and not to let him approach dogs.  I'm pretty fucking pissed now and tell this lady that this yard is his house and i emphasized that her fucking dog does not have permission to come into my yard.  She calls me an asshole and an irresponsible parent. I roll my eyes at this comment and call her an insane person.

127,1ed3tx2,AITA for not throwing my daughter a bday party?,"Hello fellow Redditors. This one should be quick, but just incase I’ll add a tldr at the end 

AITA for not wanting to have a bday party for my 1yr old? I’ve gotten so much flak and grief for this decision and even though my husband and I completely agree, his family does not. Nothing to dramatic besides some side eyes and some weird comments. 
My husband and I were in agreement for our soon to be 3 yr old and our now 1yr that bday parties before school didn’t really make sense. My sons bday is so close to Xmas and the tiny holidays thought the year provide him with abundance especially when I get word of a good sale- in short were bursting through with books and toys and clothes that outside of grocery money, we literally do not need anything and are drowning in donations and stuff!! Between the both of them they have over 100 books and dressers full of clothes (future sizes in good stock too) and plenty of toys that they end up ignoring. 
They’re so close in age and we’re not sticklers for specific clothing on our daughter for how fast she grows, a bow in hair and some ruffles added here and there turn most boy clothes into gender neutral or feminine but I digress. 

I truly wasn’t trying to be snarky or anything and we celebrated with her first cake and some professional photos but kept it at our house for a nice quiet dinner just the intimate housemate style. I’m so grateful to say my kids are properly cared for and loved 🥰 I just don’t see the sense in so much money going toward something they don’t understand and to only be endowed with more things, though I know are given out of love, become hard to find space for or get broken quickly. I’d rather them get gifts at Xmas and their Easter baskets until they’re older to understand and appreciate. 

To be fair, my son did have a birthday with the family, however it was sprung on us due to my SIL having her bday the day before. So very sweetly she made her day a joint day for our son and she didn’t want my girl to miss out. I truly understand her intentions, but I just wanted a quiet intimate with my last child’s first birthday. 

Is this strange? Bang out of order? Idk… let me know suggestions and judgements. It’s why we’re here. Cheers. 


Edit: omg forgot the tldr

The farm is north 10 min and she is south 10 min. I was under the impression she would get hers and I get mine. Well, this last month she would call me super early Saturday mornings, like I’m still in bed waking up, asking if I’m going to go now. She kept insisting that she would get it for us.

We were out of town one Saturday, share day. We donated our share that week. Monday, my aunt called me to see if I was going to pick up the share. I confirmed that it was Monday and our pick-up day is Saturday. Then she tells me that she told the farmer we would pick up later. Fine whatever but that information wasn’t relayed to me. Then she asked again. I huffed and told her no. I told her I can go later but I’m busy now.

My mom asked me to come over. When I get over there, my aunt already called my mom to tattle on me. When she got off the phone, I told her exactly why I reacted the way I did. She knew her sister well and understood me. All is well, or so I thought. I come back home to finish up what I was working on and get containers together to get the share later. A couple hours later, she comes in my home and ask if I have my containers ready. I said no, I’m working on it now. She starts ripping into me. Asking me what my problem is with her, how can I treat her like this, etc. I said Aunt I will tell you what my problem is. My problem is yo… she stops me instantly and said that my problem has nothing to do with her. I was going to tell her my problem was that no matter what was going on, if it wasn’t on her schedule, she’d get mad. She went off, yelling at the top of her lungs about how I’m a terrible person. I was a kid who got everything handed to them and didn’t work for anything. It finally ended a few minutes later with her calling me a selfish, spoiled bitch. My fight or flight response is freeze. I just stood there and took the abuse, holding my composure but shaking inside. She said she’ll get her own share and slammed to door as she left.

I composed myself enough to text my mom that I’ll get the share today but I’m out and if she wanted to stay in, she had to work with aunt. I’m done. She responded with ok. I left and got our share.
