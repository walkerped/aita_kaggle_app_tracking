0,1edutc2,AITA for telling my colleagues to “stop talking about me” and “worry about their own boring lives”,"I (23F) work in a school, and recently I was told by a close colleague that there is a rumour being spread around staff that I am having an affair with a male teacher, let’s call him Jim (30-35yrs).

Apparently the rumours started when we went out as a group for ‘end of year’ drinks a few months ago, and we (myself and Jim) had one conversation, which I don’t even remember the topic of. And a group of women I work with, who are known to be the gossips of the school, saw this and created this rumour. I know it’s them because they make it a point to ask me about Jim at random times and walk away laughing when I don’t give a response or tell them to stop as it makes me uncomfortable. 

This has escalated to rumours about us kissing, myself and his wife having arguments (even though I’ve never met her) and the most recent one is a few weeks ago people at work went out for drinks again and I didn’t attend, and apparently neither did Jim, which made people jump to the conclusion that we were sleeping together. Of course, this spread like wildfire.

Keep in mind Jim is married with a new born child, and I have no romantic interest, we only ever talk at work and when we do it’s about work.

However next year the Principle has decided to mix up which class staff teach in, and I have been put in Jim’s class, which I have no issue with as we get on well at work, but when this was announced the group of women found me after work and started to make ‘jokey’ remarks about how ‘happy’ I must be, and how I can ‘enjoy some alone time’ with Jim. I was just so sick of being made fun of and spoken about so I said (kind of shouted) to them “will you just shut up, stop talking about me and worry about your own boring lives”. I don’t usually stoop down to people when they’re being mean but I’d had enough. 

2 out of the 3 women started to cry and say how my comments were undeserved and rude and they were only making jokes. They walked away and I got called into the deputy principal’s office the next day as they had reported me. I made her aware of all the things going on and how I had asked them to stop repeatedly, but she just said that I need to understand that it’s all jokes and to not let it get to me and that I shouldn’t have shouted at them. Don’t get me wrong, I can take a joke, but when it turns into making out that I’m a homewrecker, that’s crossed the line in my opinion.

1,1edut5x,AITA for being rude  to  and ignoring my boyfriend's friends?,"



Me (20M) and my boyfriend Lysander (19M) live together and so we both end up spending alot of time with eachothers friends. Thing is Lysander was a sporty Jock kid in school and most of his friends are straight sporty guys and we live in Tennessee. Not that I'm really fem or anything, not that there's anything wrong with that  its just that I'm an average nerdy  guy who was never that into sports and with slightly gayer friends. So  to his friends that means I'm ""the girl"" in our relationship.

They constantly joke about him needing to ask his ""old lady"" for permission to go out drinking or have a boys night  or referring to me and his wife. Or stuff like asking him if he gave his ""lil lady"" some money to get her nails done because sometimes I paint my nails. Lysander digs in on it and makes jokes with him even after I've told him  privately that it bothers me. I end up juts rolling with it to keep the peace with his friends.

I talked to my brother's (23 and 19) and my friends about it and they said I should just straight up ignore his friends whenever they start up and to just pretend they aren't there. So I tried that over the last week and today Lysander confronted me about and he told me his friends thought I was being rude to them by ignoring them and not engaging with them when they come over. I told him that I don't want to talk to people who constantly make fun of me and he gets upset saying that's just them joking around and that's how it's been his whole life. He tells me maybe if I tried to get along with them better and just indulged them I wouldn't be so offended.

2,1edupiv,AITA for screaming at my father for blocking me from contacting my siblings?,"I, (F15) screamed at my father over the phone and it was for a reason. He has blocked me now. He does not live with me, I didn’t even know he existed until I was around 8 years old. I live with my step dad and mum and 4 of my siblings who are related to my step dad and my mum. Around 13, I realised how much of a lousy father my dad really is. He hardly texts/texted me, never tried to see me or be involved with my life etc. I have explained how frustrated and unfair he is to me a few times and last year I had blocked him for the first time and what i thought would be the last. This year I finally got to have full contact with my brother and sister who are also related to my father who live in London. My dad lives in Spain (he moved a few years back) by the way.

Me and my sister planned for me to go on a train to see them both as we hadn’t been able to see/talk to each other in about a year and a half. So this happened, I saw them, and a day later my father yelled and yelled at my brother and sister. This was for not telling him I had come to the see them. I’m assuming he is mad because he’s jealous possibly? He had blocked my sisters apps on her phone so she could not use them for a few days. He can only do this because he had put parental controls on her phone and not told my siblings mother the password. My sister came round my house a week later and i did not know about my dad knowing about me seeing them last week. So my sister told me about what happened, and I lost it. I unblocked my dad and texted him about how angry I am that he took this out on my siblings. Punishing them for no reason. He told me I was lying about this? I knew I wasn’t as my sister and her mother told me! I blocked him after again because I was sick of him just blatantly lying and not even apologising. After my sister went home the next day, my dad had once again blocked my sister apps, including Whatsapp which is the app she is able to contact me on. So she could not contact me and my dad knew this. I was fuming. I called him and screamed at him for blocking contact from my sister and called him selfish. All he said was “wow” and then hung up on me. And then I was blocked. I cried my eyes out, I couldn’t believe he blocked his daughter. I promised myself I’d never call him an asshole or anything mean in a sense because I’m sort of scared he might un alive himself or something if I do. All i called him was selfish and a liar. Which are both true. I don’t know or not if i was an asshole for doing this. I don’t even know if he’ll ever unblock me again.

4,1edujq8,AITA for trying to dissuade my mom from a scam,"Hi internet 
I will just keep it as short as possible. My mom and I are very close, we've gone through a lot together over the years.

Sadly, I lost my father recently and it was hard and my mom found someone on the internet she has an interest in.

I'm happy for her and wish to see her smiling and laughing but the guy she's communicating with is giving me red flags 🚩 

Like a ton of pig butchering flags 
(Love bombing, supposedly successful, shows/talks crypto in the first month, calls day and night nonstop, promises for a happy future, etc etc) 

At first I tried to give subtle hints that this could be a scam but since nothing bad happened, and as long as she was happy, I was alright with just being on the sidelines watching. That is until recently when he started to ask for money to ""teach"" her how to invest without meeting her yet (he cancelled the meeting) 

That was the one red flag I felt I had to step in and tell her ""hey this is a possible scam don't do it"" because it isn't a small chump of change either
 
I tried to show her proof (ex: invalid phone number, incorrect address, no proof of the account linking to them personally, no one named that in the US that matches his info) but she kept denying it and instead criticized me and said I was trying to control her, mold her into someone I want, doesn't understand the business world, a fool that doesn't know anything.

 It hurt, it hurt a lot and even after communicating with the guy and him giving 0 proof on speaker with her right there, she wouldn't budge.
I tried to communicate how she hurt my feelings and also to not give anymore money (if she really was going to go through with this-and she did) until she met the guy.

She rejected my feelings and said I had no reason to be upset since it didn't involve me.

It hasn't been a week and I try not to communicate with her too much when we see each other because I'm still very bitter about what she said to me  
AITA: for trying to get involved because I felt this was a scam that could harm her and giving her the cold shoulder after what she said to me 

UPDATE: I know no one probably asked but I tried to mend our relationship and ended up prostrating myself and begging for forgiveness for being the greatest mistake and failure of her life

It used to be so bad that, back when I was 22, I was hospitalized for one night because of it. It got a lot better and I was finally able to be a normal human being…and then the pandemic happened and it was like my mind exploded. I’ve had to work hard to pick up the pieces ever since then, and even now, it’s a work in progress. Anyway, I have an older sister, “MK” \[34f\] who is in the middle of a big dispute with her boyfriend, “JC” (32m). They met when they were playing baseball together back in college. I never liked JC, and last year, when he lost an arm-wrestling match against my sister and he responded by yanking her ponytail back and hurting her, that’s when I started to hate him.



Last month, MK and I went on a trip abroad to London, and then to Amsterdam. It was just the two of us, and she really needed this vacation. On the second day of our vacation, MK was still adjusting from the jetlag, so she was asleep in her room when I went out to explore London. While I was out, I bought a very beautiful dress for her, just because I wanted to help her feel good about herself. I wanted to surprise MK with the dress on the last night of our euro trip.



As the days went by, my own mental health took a few hits too, and the stress of organizing the trip, remembering this street name and that bus route to our hotel, etc etc, it all got out of hand. So during the Amsterdam part of the trip, my sister and I were sharing the same hotel room, and she happened to find the dress before I got to tell her about it and give it to her. When I came back from my evening walk, I went up to our hotel room, and I found my sister trying out the dress and seeing how it looks on her. She got a bit flustered when I entered the room and she tried to excuse herself and change back into her normal clothes. I ended up throwing a fit because the dress was supposed to be a happy surprise, and I was already feeling pretty irritable due to all the OCD tension. This led to MK getting upset and ranting about how all she know how to do is “fuck up” all the time, and we got into a fight in the hotel room. During the fight, I “threatened” to ship the dress back to the store in London, and I mockingly called her ""princess"" and asked her if the dress made her feel good about herself.",Everyone Sucks,2024-07-28,"AITA for fighting with my sister because she helped herself (without getting my approval) to a dress that I bought for her?

I never liked JC, and last year, when he lost an arm-wrestling match against my sister and he responded by yanking her ponytail back and hurting her, that’s when I started to hate him.



Last month, MK and I went on a trip abroad to London, and then to Amsterdam. It was just the two of us, and she really needed this vacation. On the second day of our vacation, MK was still adjusting from the jetlag, so she was asleep in her room when I went out to explore London. While I was out, I bought a very beautiful dress for her, just because I wanted to help her feel good about herself. I wanted to surprise MK with the dress on the last night of our euro trip.



As the days went by, my own mental health took a few hits too, and the stress of organizing the trip, remembering this street name and that bus route to our hotel, etc etc, it all got out of hand. So during the Amsterdam part of the trip, my sister and I were sharing the same hotel room, and she happened to find the dress before I got to tell her about it and give it to her. When I came back from my evening walk, I went up to our hotel room, and I found my sister trying out the dress and seeing how it looks on her. She got a bit flustered when I entered the room and she tried to excuse herself and change back into her normal clothes. I ended up throwing a fit because the dress was supposed to be a happy surprise, and I was already feeling pretty irritable due to all the OCD tension. This led to MK getting upset and ranting about how all she know how to do is “fuck up” all the time, and we got into a fight in the hotel room. During the fight, I “threatened” to ship the dress back to the store in London, and I mockingly called her ""princess"" and asked her if the dress made her feel good about herself.",2.0,1.0537580251693726,1,0
9,1eel0bd,AITA because I won't let my neighbors watch TV with their sound bar?,"I live in a single story, 2-bedroom apartment. Only one wall of my apartment is shared with my neighbors. This shared wall divides our living room and our Master bedrooms. 

My neighbors, Amber and her son, Connor, moved in about a year after I did. At first things were going well enough. There were some noise disturbances, but nothing I couldn't ignore or felt the need to report. It wasn't until 4 months or so into their own lease that the noise disturbances became more of a nuisance. That was when Robert moved in. Robert moved in with a sound bar. Immediately, from the moment they woke up at 11am, until they went to bed around 2am, every TV show and movie was played through the sound bar. They often would yell, laugh, ect., while they watched TV, which added to the problem, and I have tried everything to get them to reduce their noise, and have even tried ear plugs. 

Now, for you to understand how much of an issue this has been, from my headboard to their TV/sound bar is approximately 30 feet(allowing for the possibility that their TV is not flush with the wall it is against in their room). I know this is the arrangement because I used to visit their apartment. When they start watching TV, I can hear everything on the other side of my apartment.

I have knocked and asked them politely to turn it down. They turn it up. I have banged on the wall and asked them to please turn it down. I get ignored or yelled at and again, they turn it up. I have made complaints to the property manager. I have made numerous reports to the police. The last one was a week ago, so I had decided to take matters into my own hands.

I have a Sony Bluetooth stereo. It has two small speakers and a big square speaker that puts out a lot of bass. Every time they turn on their sound bar, I have Bluetoothed into my stereo, all speakers faced into our shared bedroom wall, and played my own movie to drown out theirs. Whenever they have turned up their volume, I have turned up mine.The loudest I have had to go is 32 out of 50. 

I do want to note that when they are not using their sound bar, I am not using my stereo. I have a much smaller Bluetooth speaker I connect to if I want to listen to music in my kitchen. My TV, which is in my living room, is always between level 7 to 10. No idea how loud it can go, but I typically keep it at a 7 and turn it up as needed, but not past 10. They have never made a complaint about any noise I may be making to the property manager.

Her pregnancy is taking a huge toll on her, she had awful morning sickness and pre existing medicinal conditions that have worsened and she is on sick leave. 

I offered to plan her baby shower as she was unable to, and offered up our place for her and BIL as it was mainly family and a few friends that I know through her. 

The baby shower was a hit, Ana was really pleased with how everything turned out and at the shower told everyone that she is keeping the gender of her baby a surprise, but her and BIL picked out a name for the baby. They want to name the baby Five as the number is the amount of years they have tried to conceive and it took them 3 miscarriages and one termination.

Ana said it’s a reminder of her baby’s older siblings, and I expressed in private after she asked what I thought of the name that it might not be this symbolic for their baby when they grow up to understand the meaning, I did say the word burden which led to Ana getting really upset and left, and my BIL followed her out. 

BIL called me after and was upset and said I made Ana cry and ruined the baby shower.  My husband agrees with me on the name Five, but he thinks it wasn’t our place to say anything and that Ana and his brother had been through a lot of infertility struggles and that I should just let her have the name as there are worse names she could have picked.

11,1eeknut,AITAH for asking my husband to start gaming in the computer room instead of the bedroom?,"I want to preface by saying that I am not anti video game. As long as I get some quality time on the weekend, I'm good.

That said, I really dislike the setup he has right now. He games in our bedroom because we have a big screen in there. We have a tiny room and it takes up most of the wall.

Our bedroom is also the only room that has air conditioning. So in the evenings in summer, we both prefer to stay in our bedroom after dinner. 

He has a setup downstairs but doesn't use it because there is no ac in that room, he has to sit in a chair instead of a bed, and he likes to ""feel like we're hanging out"" while he games.

I really dislike hearing game sounds and having gore flashed in front of my face on a giant screen all night. And I especially don't like it when I'm trying to fall asleep in our bed. I also don't feel AT ALL like we are hanging out when he's gaming. I basically feel invisible lol.

I've asked him to game downstairs so I can use the TV and then go to sleep when I want to. I suggested we get an ac unit for that room, and he can game down there.

But again he insists, he wants to hang out with me. He doesn't wanna be alone downstairs and it's not as comfortable.

Sure, I could sit downstairs until I wanna go to bed. But the only TV is upstairs. So I'd have to be in the mood for painting every single night or something. And even so, he games wayyyy later than I want to be up. So I'd still have a problem when I went up to sleep.

13,1eejta1,AITA for not supporting my mom’s decision to date my boyfriend’s dad?,"My (20F) boyfriend’s (21M) dad recently came out to visit, which resulted in my mom and him “developing” feelings for each other. I know I have no say in what they do because they are adults, but I definitely feel uncomfortable with their choice. 

I have been with my boyfriend for five years now, and when we first got together (at 15) he was living with his dad. His dad was pretty abusive and an alcoholic, which gave my boyfriend a lot of permanent trauma, and caused him to move in with his mom 2 years into our relationship. The only reason we allowed his dad to visit though, was because he claimed of going to therapy and changing. To me and my boyfriend, it seems like a lot hasn’t changed because when he gets angry or drinks, he will act the same way he used to towards my boyfriend. 

My mom has been with multiple guys throughout my life, and all of which have had the same personality and problems as my boyfriend’s dad, so it’s kind of an obvious pattern in my eyes. The only difference now is that I have my own place and am able to choose whether or not I stick around to deal with this kind of stuff if it bothers me.

Again, this is my BOYFRIENDS dad.

Initially finding out that they had feelings for each other caused an insane argument between me, my mom, and boyfriend’s dad. I take most of the responsibility since I freaked out over the discussion due to the situation given, which definitely caused more drama than there needed to be. I have since communicated with both in a more calmly manner, saying that I don’t feel comfortable with their decision based on what I said earlier in this post. They said regardless of how anyone feels, they aren’t willing to change their minds basically, which I didn’t want to agree with at first, but do now because it really is their choice.

So, I’m choosing to remove myself from everything going on and not support it, because to me it’s just a really weird move for my mom to do based on the things given. My boyfriend doesn’t have a huge opinion since he is not close with his dad anymore, or my mom, but he’s choosing to side with me because he does think it’s a bit weird regardless. I’ve also heard his dad talking bad about me multiple times for being upset over this, which only makes me feel weirder that my mom’s ok with dating him. My mom has also known about the abuse towards my boyfriend ever since it was going on, which makes me uncomfortable. 

I feel like it’s fair for me to want to feel this way, but they keep insisting that I’m being rude and dramatic and that I don’t want my mom to be happy.

10. **Fire risk:** Piled up equipment under the stairs despite the landlord's warning.
11. **Dishwasher:** Uses all the cutlery and crockery, leaving the dishwasher full and cupboards empty.
12. **Parking:** Has an abandoned car taking up a street parking spot.
13. **Smoking:** Smokes out back with the kitchen door open making kitchen and living room smell.
14. **Cigarette begging:** Begs for cigarettes from housemates and nearby workers.
15. **Washing machine:** Leaves laundry in the washing machine for days, blocking others' use.
16. **Night disturbances:** Knocks on doors late at night, waking people up with inconsiderate requests.
17.  **Cleaning supplies** Doesn't own or use dish soap, sponges, bin liners or any cleaning materials.

14. **Cigarette begging:** Begs for cigarettes from housemates and nearby workers.
15. **Washing machine:** Leaves laundry in the washing machine for days, blocking others' use.
16. **Night disturbances:** Knocks on doors late at night, waking people up with inconsiderate requests.
17.  **Cleaning supplies** Doesn't own or use dish soap, sponges, bin liners or any cleaning materials.

Bonus point: He's barred from two local pubs and claims he did nothing wrong.

John's main argument is that I shouldn't be ""moaning in the group chat."" My response is that I shouldn't have to complain; we are all adults and should respect shared spaces without expecting others to tolerate such behavior.

17,1eejgh0,AITA for telling my Grandparents to kick my Aunt and Uncle out and let me move in to help with my aunt and uncles kids?,"(using fake names for privacy reasons)

I (15F) Have a good about of cousins (about 37-42 depending on how you count them) and the biggest family we have has 5 kids. These kids (for the most part) are super sweet but most have a disiability of some sort

* ""Mike"" (11m) has severe andger issues and helps out with his siblings a lot (he doesnt like it)

* ""John"" (10m) is severly autistic and is rather clumbsy

* ""Molly"" (6F) is clingy, mostlikely bi-polar, and definitly has a princess complex

* ""Kayleigh"" (4F) has speech delays and is roumored to be autistic (she also isnt bathroom trained)

* ""Baye"" (9 months M) is a baby with skin problems 

Now this family defintly has its problems, and the parents got kicked out of their house a few years ago and moved in with my uncles parents. They got kicked out 3 days after the baby was born and moved in with my grandparents. The living situtation there is absolute hell. My Grandparents are retired and have a 4-bedroom-house. The two of them residing in one of the bedrooms, and the family that moved in taking up two, the last room is the mud room that i put an air-mattress in when I stay (I come over often to help with the kids, makes it more managable for my granparents.)

All the familys (other than the one staying with my grandparents) and my grandparents have a problem with this set up, the baby and the parents have a room and ALL the other kids share a bedroom, the ""Mike"" and ""Molly"" even share a bed, ""John"" and ""Kayleigh"" have their own beds because they're both frequent bed-wetters.

My Grandmother went out with some of the adult females in my damily today while my siblings and I were at work. And my grandmother was complaining about the family staying with them. As-to the dact that the parents are slobbish. Now, this wouldn't be a problem if they are looking for a flat but they are not. they have been there for around 10 months and havent been doing anything about the living situation. My grandparents wanna kick them out but dont want to keep the kids on the street, they would keep the kids but they're at retirement age and don't wantto raise 5 kids.

I want to tell them to kick the parents out and let me live there to help out (they don't live that far away so I would still be able to see my siblings and parents) because its unlike I dont help out, the girls both call me ""mommy"" anyway, but I dont know if I would be the a**hole for saying this because it is technically ""not my buisness"" about whats going on there. and it may be counted as ""disrespect"" to my parents for wanting ti move, and ""disrespect"" to my Aunt and Uncle for trying to get them seperated from their kids that they barley parent as-is.

18,1eejfni,"AITA for refusing to ""pay back"" my friend who thought they were paying my bill for me? ","This happened about a month ago and is still causing some tension in our friend group, so I thought I'd turn to reddit.

End of June was one of my good buddies birthdays, and as such we decided we would head downtown to a nice restaurant to celebrate. This was also around the time of final exams and projects for me, so I knew I wouldn't be able to attend the whole time and let everyone know.

So, the situation plays out like this. Night of the dinner I get dropped off by my mom at the restaurant. Once there I realize I don't have enough cash on hand to pay for what would be a pretty pricey meal (for me) , and I wanted to pay in cash so that it would make leaving early easier. I borrow $20 from my mother, have a great time at the dinner, and then I get a text from my mom that she is back to pick me up at our agreed time. I tell everyone I'm leaving early, get my bill and ask if I can just pay cash. The waitress says sure, no worries, we can do that at the front. So I go up, pay for my ~$30 meal and leave, end of story.

I don't hear anything from my friends until the next weekend when we're all free again, so we plan a more chill hangout. At this hangout, I get told that when my friends were paying their bills, another waitress (we had two to our table, they may have switched shifts or something?) had asked where I went and upon being told I left, told my friends my bill was unpaid. Being the great friends they are, one of them picked up the extra $30, without even calling or texting me to ask. I'd like to think I'm a stand up guy, never stolen or dine and dashed before, so I'm not sure why they went along with paying without even trying to confirm with me. I let them all know that I had in fact paid, and that the waitresses were either disorganized and made a mistake, or they got scammed. Everyone seemed to understand, the one guy who paid seemed a bit bummed cause he was expecting $30, but other than that everything was fine and we moved on.

Now, here's the fucky part. One of my friends has a sister who is best friends with my sister. Somehow, someway, this story made it around our parents and siblings circles and when my parents found out they insisted that I pay back my friend since 2/3rds of the bill was my mom's money anyways. This also got around back to my friend group, that most of my bill that I paid was my mom's money, and now the guy who ""paid"" my bill and a few other friends are calling me an asshole for not forking aver $30 to cover him. The other half of my friend group, my siblings and myself find it ridiculous that I would have to cough up another $30 to cover, when I already paid for my meal and I wasn't the one scammed. I don't see how whether I paid with my money or money I borrowed from my mom makes a difference in whether I have to pay or not, and I am refusing to pay another $30. Am I being an asshole here?

Edit: Since this seems to be a big topic of initial replies, no I don't have/didn't get a receipt. It's common where I'm from for the wait staff to ask if you'd like a copy, and most people I know decline unless they need to write off a dinner or something. I didn't take a copy this time, but this situation might make me ask for it going forward.

Edit2: An update for those that don't want to wade through the comments. Don't see anyone saying I should pay the $30 to my friend which was my main question. I won't be. Also a few comments here I showed to my mom, and she now sees my point better which I'm happy with, so this wasn't for naught. Although she still wants me to pay out of ""principal"". Lots of comments about receipts and splitting bills. 1) I never took receipts before this cause I've never needed them, even if I did I wouldn't have kept it a week let alone a month probably. 2) Our culture is to always split the bill for what we've paid. There was never an expectation that it would be one big group bill. They all paid solo as well. 3) No I didn't ""announce"" that I paid, because in the moment that would feel extremely unnecessary. If you can read in my OG post I asked for the bill at the table, and then walked to the front with the waitress to pay cash. It was evident I would pay, I wouldn't never thought to bring back the receipt to the table as ""proof"" or confirm in our group chat that I paid. 

Most of the negative comments below are aimed at my lack of motivation to clear things up with the restaurant, whether that be calling or driving in. The guy who is out $30 doesn't want to drive in and hasn't called the restaurant, nor asked me to do it with him. He only has dropped sneak suggestions I pay him the full amount and created a weird tension in our group over it. I don't see why I should go about this solo if he isn't even willing to do it himself for his own money. If I could clear this all up that simply, no shit I would. But it's his card that was paid on, I'd assume if this could even be fixed they would need that anyways.

19,1eeje23,AITA for refusing to deep clean a flat I’ve stayed in for free. ,"I have two friends that I met via uni that I’ve kept in touch with over the years. I’m going to call them “Darren” and “Lisa”. The last couple years we have been doing a week here and there for people’s birthdays etc at Darren’s flat. Just an excuse to see eachother. Since Darren is the only one that lives alone it just made sense + I’m from Weston-super-Mare and Lisa is from a small town in Shropshire. Darren lives in Newcastle the city trip just makes sense. 

Darren has had quiet a hectic year and a few months our planned trip before he was very honest about what had been going on. This included the fact he had brought a roommate in who turned out to be a terrible one. I offered for us to get a hotel to make life easier and Darren liked the idea but when we looked at the prices so close to the trip it looked difficult. I wanted to delay because of it and he then said he would make it work. I didn’t fight it because I wanted to go on the trip but didn’t really want to pay for accommodation. This is where I really feel my entitlement caused this. 

The roommate left the week before we arrived as he didn’t want to share the flat. The flat was trashed again by this vindictive roommate When we arrived, it had not been cleaned in the slightest and was in a bad way. Bare in mind, he did tell me it was bad but where I feel I’m not in the wrong - he didn’t tell me he hadn’t even cleaned the flat slightly. I had travelled the entire day and spent the evening, cleaning to make sure we all could even sleep in this flat (Darren’s room was trashed as well).

Darren has spent most of the week trip struggling to keep up with what we had planned and so sometimes we have left him to sort stuff out. Not everything stops just because you take a week off. However, he knew our plans and tonight asked again what time we are leaving. When I said 8am, he lost it. Said we haven’t spent anytime sorting out his flat. I mentioned the bits we have done over the week, especially on the first night. I admit we haven’t exactly hoovered every part of the carpets or done a deep clean of the bathroom but we have never been told we needed to. He pointed out the flat is still not great and we have stayed at his for free. I feel we both have treated him out for dinners and drinks + have cleaned parts of his flat and kept up on dishes.

Lisa felt we should maybe do a bit more tonight but I still feel that I’m being made to do something that I’ve never been told was a requirement. All our stuff is packed up. Any bit of mess that I’ve made, I’ve cleaned up and then some. 

Reasons I think I could be the asshole:
- I stayed in a flat for free and have done about 5 times
-I knew the situation was bad and was warned but we still went she was 
- I refuse to clean someone else’s mess because I wasn’t told I had to until the last day even thought it isn’t my friends mess either.

22,1eeiyw4,AITA for asking my parents to stop telling people I am in hospital?,"Hi all. I (25f) am currently pregnant and have been admitted to hospital a few days ago for a suspected clot in my lung following severe chest pain. I am still in hospital right now.

A few weeks ago, my wonderful maternal grandfather passed from cancer and we are obviously as a family still upset.

2.5 years ago I was in a car accident. I broke my back in 3 places, my pelvis, and 3 ribs. It was during COVID so I was admitted to hospital and had loads of scans all through the day/night. Once they figured that I didn’t need corrective surgery they discharged me the following morning with morphine tablets and a wheelchair. I came out of hospital to  around 100 messages from people I barely knew wishing me well. My mum and stepdad had posted pictures of my wrecked car on Facebook and told everyone they knew about the accident and specifics about my injuries. At the time I asked them to take down the posts as I did not want people knowing all about my personal life. They never took the posts down.

Today my friend told me that my mum has been sending messages into group chats telling people that I am pregnant and in hospital. My stepdad told his family the same. I have told them that my husband and I want to share the news ourselves. I told them that I was so hurt and disappointed that they have told people and also lied to me about it. I pointed out the lie and told them that I had again, received messages from others proving that they lied. My mum then sent me a voice note of her crying saying “sorry I don’t know what I have done but I am sorry. I must be the worst mother in the world. I am just so upset about Pappa too.” It was hard to hear her so upset by I just reiterated that asking for privacy was not too much to ask.

My stepdad who I have been very close to also sent me a voice note telling me that “they don’t need this stress” and to stop being so hateful over something so “trivial”. He told me that I was clearly hormonal but that he’ll “let it slide this time” because I am pregnant. He told me that my mum has cried for over 30 mins and it’s all my fault and that it’s all over nothing. Also, that they told other people because they are worried about me. Hesaid they will never apologise as they haven’t done anything wrong. He also said that I am the daughter he never had and that he loves me but that he is so disappointed in my behaviour.

The original message that started this sent to my mum:

I am just hurt and disappointed as I would have much preferred privacy. I don’t feel like sharing any more because I don’t know who you are both sharing it with and it has actually made me being in hospital much more stressful

I might be TA because we are all grieving and emotions are running high. I also don’t feel like they told other people in a malicious way, just thoughtless. So, AITA? ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-28,"AITA for asking my parents to stop telling people I am in hospital? Hi all. I (25f) am currently pregnant and have been admitted to hospital a few days ago for a suspected clot in my lung following severe chest pain. I am still in hospital right now.

A few weeks ago, my wonderful maternal grandfather passed from cancer and we are obviously as a family still upset.

2.5 years ago I was in a car accident. I broke my back in 3 places, my pelvis, and 3 ribs. It was during COVID so I was admitted to hospital and had loads of scans all through the day/night. Once they figured that I didn’t need corrective surgery they discharged me the following morning with morphine tablets and a wheelchair. I came out of hospital to  around 100 messages from people I barely knew wishing me well. My mum and stepdad had posted pictures of my wrecked car on Facebook and told everyone they knew about the accident and specifics about my injuries. At the time I asked them to take down the posts as I did not want people knowing all about my personal life. They never took the posts down.

Today my friend told me that my mum has been sending messages into group chats telling people that I am pregnant and in hospital. My stepdad told his family the same. I have told them that my husband and I want to share the news ourselves. I told them that I was so hurt and disappointed that they have told people and also lied to me about it. I pointed out the lie and told them that I had again, received messages from others proving that they lied. My mum then sent me a voice note of her crying saying “sorry I don’t know what I have done but I am sorry. I must be the worst mother in the world. I am just so upset about Pappa too.” It was hard to hear her so upset by I just reiterated that asking for privacy was not too much to ask.

My stepdad who I have been very close to also sent me a voice note telling me that “they don’t need this stress” and to stop being so hateful over something so “trivial”. He told me that I was clearly hormonal but that he’ll “let it slide this time” because I am pregnant. He told me that my mum has cried for over 30 mins and it’s all my fault and that it’s all over nothing. Also, that they told other people because they are worried about me. Hesaid they will never apologise as they haven’t done anything wrong. He also said that I am the daughter he never had and that he loves me but that he is so disappointed in my behaviour.

The original message that started this sent to my mum:

Sorry it’s just I’ve had messages from people today wishing me well in hospital so I know you lied about who you have told about me being here. I am just hurt and disappointed as I would have much preferred privacy.

24,1eeinux,AITA for asking to go to the gym after 6pm?,"
Me (16F) don't agree with my parents about the rules in my house. I currently live in Canada, and my family is from a country where girls typically don’t go out, I didn’t fit in with Canadian kids because my parents insisted on sticking to these cultural norms.

My main issue is that my father won’t let me out past 6 PM. I feel this is unreasonable; I'm 16 and have more maturity than most kids my age. I work at home, take care of my siblings (10M and 4F), and handle various responsibilities, even while my parents socialize at events. I believe I deserve to go out past 6 PM. Kids from the same country that I know as me are allowed out after 6. My brother is allowed to go out whenever he wants and stay out late. Last week, my father didn’t say anything when my brother came home at 8.

When I tried discussing this with my father recently, he yelled, “You are no one in this house and you will not make any decisions.” He says this a lot. I am not allowed to go to sleepovers, and last time I tried to go downtown, he stopped me at the door and made me miss my bus. He said he doesn’t like it when I go out with friends for “no reason,” but when I asked why my brother can play outside every day, he didn’t respond.

My brother plays nearby, while I go further since my friends live all around town. Some live 20+ minutes away while my brothers live 4 minutes from us. I’ve tried talking to my parents many times, but I always get shut down. It’s frustrating because friends have dropped me and made fun of me for not being able to hang out. This summer, I’ve only hung out with friends 3 times. My parents are financially strained, so I avoid spending money on outings, which limits my socializing. I only wanted to go out past 6 to start going to the gym, but my father is unhappy with this. I’m hesitant to press the issue because last time, my father stopped talking to me for a month, and he did the same to my sister for 9 months.

Today was no different so I put my airpods in my ear and start listening to music. Me, my parents, and my grandparents were altogether going on a roadtrip.

We were 45 minutes in when I had to stop listening because my mother has this rule where I can’t use my airpods for over 45 minutes a day, which I think is stupid but whatever.

But I got bored quickly so I asked my mother if we could listen music through the car bluetooth but she said no because it was “disrespectful” and I had to be considerate of other’s in the car. So I asked everyone if it was okay. Nobody cared. Yet she still said I wasn’t allowed.

So I just press my phone against my ear and listen to music ‘cause it doesn’t contradict any of my mother’s rule.

She tapped on my shoulder and told me it was too loud. It was only two sounds up (idk what to call it).

At this point, I was pissed so I told her, “It’s just music, calm down.”

26,1eeihg5,WIBTA if I tell my husband if he wants to sleep in he needs to also wake up for the baby?,"Hello everybody,

WIBTA if I (32f) tell my husband (33m) that if he wants to alternate sleeping in, he also needs to wake up for feeding our baby?

Just to explain some things. My husband and I both work. Although my husband works full-time, and his work is very demanding psychically. We haven't been able to get daycare for your baby boy (1 year old) so I work parttime from home while caring full time for our child. I still breastfeed him so basically the burden of taking care of him falls on me. He still wakes up for a night feeding once or twice a night, so I haven't had a full night's sleep for over a year. My husband basically never wakes up and gets his 8 hours of sleep every night, which is important because he needs to be rested for his job. In the weekends I would wake up in the morning to breastfeed him, dress him and give him to my husband and get a couple of hours of sleep before I need to put him down for a nap. That way I get at least some more sleep and it keeps me going.

However, now we both have taken some time of work. And now my husband says he is very tired and wants to alternate sleeping in. While I get that he is tired from working hard with a job that is psychically, it does feel unfair to me that he wants to sleep in when I still have to wake up once or twice in the night to breastfeed, so he gets to sleep through the night and sleep in on the morning.

So, will I be the AH if I tell him that if he wants to alternate sleeping in, he needs to wake up for the nights when he gets to sleep in?

Edit: I have had some comments which have shown me that I was a bit unclear so I want to explain myself:

- I pump regularly, so I always have some milk in the fridge and freezer.
- On the days that my husband wants to sleep in, I would like to ask him to wake up at night, give our baby a bottle, so I can get some sleep during the night and he gets to sleep in the morning.

Edit 2: my husband works in construction. While the chance of him or his coworkers are low when he loses focus, I do not take chances with his safety! He needs a good time of sleep when he needs to work. So when he needs to work I will gladly keep on the day, night and whatever shift I need to be on. However, we both have holiday right now. So we are both not working at the moment. In this situation he wants to alternate sleeping in. And that sounds unfair to me because I am the one feeding our child in the night.

27,1eeidv1,AITA for getting mad when my husband used the egg brush to clean the bottom of his sneakers at the kitchen sink?,"I (37F) have a specific brush that I use to wash our yard eggs. It does not get used for anything else to avoid cross contamination with other foods, and this restricted use is not a secret. I walked in the kitchen the other day to find my husband (41M) using said brush to scrub the bottom of his sneakers in the kitchen sink. The sneakers are well-used, and have been in public bathrooms, parking lots, etc. He said since I use it to clean poop off eggs that it shouldn't matter if it's used to clean anything else as long as he sanitizes it afterwards. (Now, I do have what one of my friends calls an exaggerated ""ew"" factor. I like things clean. But several of my friends have the same level of clean preference, so I don't think it's an unreasonable level of cleanliness.)

I asked him if he would be fine using any brush for any reason, such as using his toothbrush to clean the toilet and then using it to brush his teeth afterwards, and he said yes, as long as it had been sanitized. He said that since he could properly sanitize the egg brush (because he has worked in wastewater treatment and is therefore an expert in sanitation), I basically have no logical reason to complain, and that it's a 'me' problem and all in my head. I don't really have a good counter-argument except that I feel like this is a breach of basic hygiene that I shouldn't have to explain (an issue that comes up frequently between us) – not only using a brush that I use for a specific food item for not-food, but also putting his dirty sneakers in the place where we wash and prepare food. He asked where else he was supposed to clean them, and I reminded him we have a brush for cleaning outside things (which he has used before), and that we also have both a tub and a big patio with a water hose. PS: he did not clean the sink afterwards...but he did buy a new egg brush.

I checked with my close friends and family to see if I really was being unreasonable, but they agreed with me. However, I know people I'm close with share my values, and so we tend to just be sounding boards for each other. So I'm asking the wider web, AITA?

Edit: This is more to find out if other people think this is a hygiene/cleanliness issue and less about whether or not he crossed a boundary.

Edit2: Not a malicious act on his part. In the grand scheme, this is a minor argument and not a threat to our marriage. But the issue of cleanliness is a common point of contention between us, and exacerbated by his belief that my standards are far and away above other people's. This was basically a poll to test that hypothesis. The whole boundary issue, while it may technically exist, is a moot point for this particular experiment (but I appreciate everyone's thoughts on that point; it was unexpected data).",Not the A-hole,2024-07-28,"AITA for getting mad when my husband used the egg brush to clean the bottom of his sneakers at the kitchen sink?

Satsuki tried to discuss this with her and asked multiple times how she could make this better for Kit which she never properly responded to and simply continued to complain without suggesting solutions (apparently Kit is known for this type of behavior)  

Today,  I was talking to ^(\[Elphaba\]) about trying to kick a screens addiction and setup blockers on their phone that caused them to never get notified about when the games were going to be, I was congratulating them on taking such a big step and relating to them by talking about the time that I went without a phone for 6 months. At that point, LaCroix hopped in the conversation and started and experiences with phones and this turned into a conversation about grandparents where I shared that mine are all now dead. 

I got distracted for a little while, and Kit came into the conversation saying ""Fuck are y'all yappin about"" when we were literally talking about dead parents/grandparents. I got pissed and said ""Don't be a bitch, we're getting to know eachother"" Satsuki insisted that I delete the comment or she would, so I deleted it but then Kit posted the meme from Johnny Silverhand ""I ain't reading all that, I'm happy for u tho"" I said ""I feel like being able to have a conversation with each other and getting to know each other is important for a D&D group. Guess you disagree?"" LaCroix jumped in and said ""Hey she isnt disagreeing or anything. Kitkallos just has a sassy personailty"" Satsuki said ""Being a bitch is Kit's most attractive quality"" I said ""Guess I've just got the kind of personality that I don't take shit from people"" Kit responded to by saying ""I didn't give any shit so idk what ur problem is lmao"" I was desperate to respond to this, but Satsuki insisted that I not respond for fear of destroying the whole D&D group so Satsuki said ""They were talking about trauma and dead grandparents, so the timing of the 'yapping' comment pissed AnnhiAlice off"" she responded with ""The timing, as if it wasn't 2 hours after the conversation died"" ""Crazy"" ""Whatever y'all I got fam time peace"" ",,0.9974372386932373,1,0

33,1eehu04,WIBTA if I refuse to reunite with my estranged aunt/cousins?,"
 I (22F) I am very close to my mom’s side, and we (my grandparents, aunts/uncles, and cousins on my mom’s side) have had a family reunion annually at an east coast lake for as long as I remember. This year, we are reuniting at that same lake again.

In contrast, my relationship with my dad’s side is strained. For context, I grew up Mormon, and my dad left the church when I was 15/16. My mom, siblings, and I left several years later. The extended family on both my mom and dad’s sides are Mormon, but my mom’s side was more tolerant to this change. When my dad left the church, his side virtually cut us off, even for the few years when my mom, siblings, and I were still members.

We used to have a reunion with my dad’s side every few years. We were supposed to have one with them when I was 16, but when my dad left the church, several of my aunts/uncles said that if anyone from my family came, they would not be going. One of my aunts (Margie) was very vocal about this; she has diagnosed borderline PD and is constantly doing toxic stuff. 

Now, some of my dad’s siblings are feeling remorseful or something, because they are talking to him again and putting in effort to see him (only him so far, not the rest of us). I saw my aunt Margie again for the first time 2 months ago when she came down to attend my dad’s military promotion.

We found out in chatting that her family (husband and kids) will be vacationing at the same lake my mom’s side and I will be at this summer during the exact same week we will be there. She then said she wants me and my fam to come visit with hers for a few hours so that she can remind her kids that they “have cousins”. She joked and said if we didn’t show up she would know “we hate them”, which I find manipulative. She did not apologize for the past or even extend an invitation; it was stated as a demand. 

After Margie left, I was talking with my sister and said I don’t plan to go visit Margie and her family because 1) you can’t just demand my time after being so cruel to me and my family for so long with no apology and 2) I already set aside that week for the family members who HAVE been there for me all along. 

My sis basically told me that this would be an AH move because my cousins didn’t do anything wrong and this would almost be punishing them. For context, Margie’s kids are a couple years younger than me, both adults.  Also, my cousins and I haven’t been in contact (we don’t even have each other’s numbers and I haven’t seen them at years because of Margie) so for all I know, they could be ambivalent and not care if I go or not. 

My sis is saying that I’m being unforgiving and living in the past. I would be open to reconcile with Margie and her kids at another time, but want to do it on my terms. The lake is a special place for me and I want to spend it making memories with my mom’s side, but WIBTA here?

For some background, we've been together since I was 16, and our relationship hasn't always been great, but we've managed to work it out. 
His family loves me, I've spent holidays with them, came over a lot to help with household stuff, bought presents, and overall they've accepted me as part of the family. Needless to say, they've been supportive of the engagement, saying I'm a great ""push"" for their son, since before meeting me he's been lazy and immature,  and now he's finally working and actually has goals.

I worked part time on top of school while we lived together (i lived away from my parents since i was 15-16),  during which time he didn't work at all and all expenses were on me, and there were a lot of conflicts, main one being when i had to leave our apartment for a few weeks after a big fight and stayed with my grandma since Ihad nowhere to go.

39,1eeh996,AITA for considering pressing charges?,"I’ll try to make this as short as possible.  About a year ago I entered a casual relationship with someone a bit younger than myself.  We never dated  but did spend a lot of time together. I was clear about him not coming to my home as I was divorced and had kids and didn’t really want anyone around that I wasn’t serious about.  After about 6 or 7 months I allowed him into my house on nights my kids were with their father. Maybe twice a week. He never had access to my house alone and I never left him there for any reason. Even if we were grabbing food or drinks he always came with me. Around late January things were a little rocky…we had some arguments and he was drinking more and I came to learn a lot of that behavior was coming from the fact that he had been on probation for something and violated that probation and had to go to jail until his case came up. We spoke while he was in jail. Mostly text messaging.  Some phone calls here and there. He was there until about mid April and was let out and placed on a new probation.

About a year ago I entered a casual relationship with someone a bit younger than myself.  We never dated  but did spend a lot of time together. I was clear about him not coming to my home as I was divorced and had kids and didn’t really want anyone around that I wasn’t serious about.  After about 6 or 7 months I allowed him into my house on nights my kids were with their father. Maybe twice a week. He never had access to my house alone and I never left him there for any reason. Even if we were grabbing food or drinks he always came with me. Around late January things were a little rocky…we had some arguments and he was drinking more and I came to learn a lot of that behavior was coming from the fact that he had been on probation for something and violated that probation and had to go to jail until his case came up. We spoke while he was in jail. Mostly text messaging.  Some phone calls here and there. He was there until about mid April and was let out and placed on a new probation.

40,1eeh6vn,AITA for fighting over music ,"
A few months ( I think it was end of march or beginning of April ) ago my mom (single mom) let her boyfriend move in without telling me. I was pretty pissed about it and we had a long fight about it. She apologised and we tried to move past it. 

He has a few quirks that annoy me. They hung up led lights in the living room which I thought was weird. It was always blue so everything time I was eating it kinda looked like shit/ less appetising. Also since he moved in my mom has stopped cooking. He eats different food than I like. This I was all fine with/ getting content with. 

But one thing that was really starting to border me was the music. Specifically the bass of it I can hear it loud and clear in my room. Since the tv in the living room is directly under my room. I HATE IT. It drives me nuts. I have told my mom this multiple times. She keeps telling me they have it as low as possible. Today I finally snapped after a long day at work. I just wanted to come home and relax but all I could hear was dom dom dom dom. I started throwing my stuffed animal around which made I lot off noise. It was really childish but I felt like I was going insane from the noise. I do have to add I have a more sensitive ear than most people. 

My mom’s boyfriend got really mad and snapped. He threw the box away and yelled that I had no respect for him and that I was spoiled. He said that I didn’t greet him and I never have to again. Cause he was going to find a place for himself ( he moved country’s for my mom so I doubt that and he is also jobless). Him yelling scared me and I felt like a jerk. I felt like I was ruining their relationship and mom hates me because she can’t have a relationship because of me. 


She told me she had been wishing he would move out because she wants peace. And couldn’t deal with the tension between us. 

I have been crying a lot and feel really bad about the whole situation. I don’t know what to do.

41,1eeh3qb,AITA who turning off my cousin wifi,"*sorry for misspellings or grammar mistakes 

So my aunt and i got a lease together after being evicted 2 time under her own name. On the least we had just her and i plus my two dogs. But we also had my cousin (her son), and my two sister (19 and 13) move in with us as well. Even though it was both of our names on the least. She refuses to keep a job, finding something wrong and quieting after a weeks. Last job she had was may of 2022. My sister never had a job and my cousin hasnt had a job since 2019. So for that past going on 3 years it been be me paying EVERYTHING. I would try and bring up my frustrations and i was told 'oh your just starting a fight, you just like to argue' yada yada. Well my aunt moved out WHILE still on the lease for a whole year. Well this year when it was time to renew our lease i convinced her to take her name off the lease. So the lease is sole in my name. So we have my cousin (almost 29), my sisters (22 and almost 16) and my dad (i said he could move in if we gave me 600$ a month and stayed sober) and i living at my place. In may, my cousin finally got a job. And i didnt mention paying rent for 2 months so he could full enjoy his money. I asked if he could start paying 300$ rent and i'll lower my dad to 300$ as well. He agreed. Well the end of july come ups and he hasnt paid has brought it up, nothing. 

*I should mention there's been constant fighting and drama with my youngest sister the whole 3 years and it gotten worse since he's gotten a job* 

So i asked him word for word ""hey (his name), the 31 is coming up Wednesday do u plan on paying the 300$?"" He's reponse was ""oh, i'll be out of there by then"" i was pissed and  felt taken advantage of so i turned his wifi off. A huge fight broke out, he threatened to steal the wifi box and i threatened to call the cops if he did. 

He or his mom has not paid a cent in anything while they lived here. And his mom did the exact same thing to me. We live within walking distance from a library if he needs the Internet for anything. And i haven't turned any of the essentials off. Just wifi, just for him. ",Everyone Sucks,2024-07-28,"AITA who turning off my cousin wifi *sorry for misspellings or grammar mistakes

42,1eegvwx,AITA for giving my mom the silent treatment,"
My mom always seems to be giving me a double standard and doesn't seem to give my siblings the same treatment. I have 6 siblings for a total of 7 kids the ages being M(30), M(27), M(25), Me F(21), M(16), M(12), and F(9). 

Recently I have been getting extremely irritated on new medications and because of this Ive had to work really hard to keep a standard level of judgement against my families actions. My oldest 2 brothers and their wives came home before having to move for work and I was on high alert not to ruin their vacation. However, during this time my mom seemed to have more of a double standard than usual. Normal I expect a little of the double standard being the middle kid so Ive grown used to it. Im always expecting to be told that im acting childish when connecting with my youngest sibling and being told that I act too old when I try to help my parents with my three youngest siblings.

 When my brothers were here though she took these comments and judgments to the extreme even after I asked her not to and explained to her I was going to work really hard to not get irritated. The entire time I felt targeted and just wanted to cry. A few examples include pulling up the rule pamphlet when playing games only on me and not on other people breaking the rules (especially when we almost never play by the rules), acting childish and ""protesting"" when I got a section in a game that she wanted and then kicking me off when I tried to match her energy in a fun way, scoffing at me for making a different dinner since I didn't like what was cooked (and then demand my dad to cook her something different) , and taking my phone to enter a higher score for herself after she lost the round and getting after me for trying to change it back. This isnt everything but just a few examples and my older siblings were telling me that I was being unreasonable for feeling like she was targeting me. 

My younger siblings feel like I'm in the right and that my mom is the AH.  Now when she starts doing a double standard I just shut my mouth and sit in place so as not to say or do anything that could make her angry and I stay quiet until she is calmed down or until she leaves. However, now that I've started doing this my mom uses that to get angry or upset with me and uses every opportunity to make me more upset.

My dad is against swearing and overheard my brother swearing one time. My dad called me into my brother's room and went crazy. Belittled and threatened us that left me traumatized.

After many more similar situations I stopped sharing about myself and felt emotionally detatched. A couple years ago, after enough emotional abuse my dad asked me one day why I never talk to him much anymore and just let all my emotions out which led to both of us crying. He said he regrets traumatizing me but never apologized for it.

I thought I had finally mended my broken relationship but it just got worse. Since then, every time I did something he didn't agree with he would blame it on my trauma because it apparently messed with my sense of thinking and constantly says I should go get checked up at a mental hospital. After my trauma I always flinch whenver he comes close to me or tries to hug or touch me. He still tries after knowing this and after asking him to stop many times he still does it and gets mad when I start crying when it got too much.

Recently my dad is calmer and doesn't disturb me as much. He sometimes says he worries about me because of our lack of communication and we should talk and share more because we're family. He doesn't push me to say much but I just tell him that I prefer not to talk. He says he's trying and I should be thankful because he's doing all kinds of things for me.

When I was jobless for 2 years because I was demotivated to do anything, he did help me a bit when I used up my savings from my previous job before finding my current one.

It's a little too late for my dad to try to fix things but sometimes I wonder if I'm going overboard and overreacting.

Edit: To those who said I should move out/why I'm still living with him, I should have mentioned that my family and I lived abroad when I was younger because they found a job there and my brother and I returned to our home country after we graduated while my parents still stayed there. It was just my brother and I in the house so I didn't have to worry about my dad until he retired a month ago and came back home to permanently live here. I have already planned to move out sometime next month but I understand it has taken me some time to do so.

47,1eefcg7,AITA for revealing my sister was faking her accent,"I (23M) am from Canada. I lived in Newfoundland until I was about 5, and then my family moved to Alberta. My sister (now 21F) was 3 when we moved. 

Newfoundland has a lot of variation in accents, but where my dad was from in particular has a very distinct, pretty difficult to understand accent. A lot of people would assume he’s Irish when first meeting him. Alberta, in comparison, is pretty much identical to a General American accent except for a few tells if you know what to look for. My sister and I both sound like any other Albertan, although we can both imitate our dad's accent really well.

Through our mother, my sister and I both have Australian citizenship. My sister moved there to be with her long distance boyfriend two years ago, while I’ve stayed in Canada. Last month, I decided to fly over and visit family, and wanted to come see her in the process. She seemed hesitant and tried to discourage me at first, but eventually agreed. 

When I went up to her apartment to visit her, she greeted me in a Newfoundland accent. I laughed and asked her why she was putting on that voice, thinking she was just joking. Her boyfriend was standing behind her and looked confused, and she got upset and told me to go away, still in the accent. I had no clue what was going on at this point, so I just left and went to my car.

30 minutes later, I got a text from her. She said she had spoken in this accent for as long as she had been in Australia, because she was tired of having to correct people assuming she was American, and her friends and boyfriend all didn’t know it wasn’t her natural accent (this is confusing to me because I’m certain she called her boyfriend before going to Australia, so she’d presumably been lying about the accent before anyone would ask her if she was American?) She said her boyfriend was pissed about her lying and I should have just gone along with it. I asked how I was supposed to know what she wanted from me and wouldn’t he be confused as to why we have two different accents anyways, and she just blocked me.

We haven’t talked since. I’m so confused and I’ve been feeling awful about potentially breaking up her relationship, but I don’t know how else I should have responded to her randomly talking to me in that accent.

I’m in a really confusing situation right now and could use some outside perspective. Recently, I found out that my aunt (my mom’s older sister) and my mom have gotten into a big fight. The thing is, I have no idea what it’s about or why it even started. They were really close before, so this has come out of nowhere.

What’s even more surprising (and hurtful) is that my aunt has stopped talking to me completely. We used to be pretty close, and now she’s acting like I don’t exist. I’ve tried reaching out to her, but she’s been ignoring my calls and messages.

I don’t want to get in the middle of whatever is going on between my mom and her, but it’s really bothering me that she’s cut me off too. I don’t know if I did something wrong, or if she’s just mad at the whole family now.

I talked to my mom about it, and she told me not to contact my aunt because it would just stir up more drama. But I miss my aunt and want to understand what’s going on. Would I be the asshole if I ignored my mom’s advice and tried to reach out to my aunt again to find out what happened and maybe fix things?

Thanks for any help or insight you can give.

Pretty much the only place I don't clean is my parents' bathroom. I never use it and I'm only in there when a parent is in there and I need to talk to them.

54,1eecxp1,AITA for refusing to play games/sports I‘m not good at right now?,"Hey, Reddit. I guess I‘m just gonna jump straight into it. Apologies for mistakes, not a native English speaker.
So, I‘m 19M and I live with my sister „Taylor“ (24F) and my parents (50F and 64M). We are really close friends with our neighbor „Carmen“ (60ishF) who comes over at least once every week. We always cook or order food and eat it together and sometimes we also do other things like playing boardgames. A few days again, my Mom picked Table Tennis up again which was her favorite sport when she was younger and Taylor and Dad picked up Badminton again, which they also played a lot earlier. Carmen, Taylor and Dad also all play Table Tennis. I had TT once in school in PE but I was very bad (I think in the US the grade I got would be D-F).


I‘m autistic and also have motorical problems with my hands specifically. I can‘t do things as accurate as others and I‘m pretty clumsy. My mind is also…kinda fragile and I have very low self-esteem. I often consider myself undeserving of living a privileged life in a western country and I also sometimes had certain dark thoughts. (I‘m in therapy and working on that, Mom and Dad kinda know about that, Taylor doesn‘t).


The actual situation is that Taylor urged me to play Table Tennis and Badminton so we can do more things as a family together and its not bad if I play bad, it‘s about the game and having fun. Obviously, she‘s right with that and I have the same view. But, I have a bad phase again right now. Last week, our 16-year-old neighbour‘s dog (not Carmens dog) Venga was euthanized and I was with her in the last hours of her life. We all knew her since so long and it hit me really bad. So I think that if I play games right now were I perform badly, it will feed my insecurities and destroy my patience and in worst case I could have a meltdown which I want to avoid because my family doesn‘t deserve that. 


When I explained it to them, Carmen, Mom and Dad were understanding and Mom told me it‘s not bad, she loves me for who I‘m and I can wait until I‘m ready enough. But Taylor was visibly disappointed and said that I‘m not the only one affected by Vengas death and its sad I don‘t even want to do something so „banal“ for my family. That really hurt to be honest and I was shocked because I certainly don‘t see it that way. 
I feel bad because I don‘t want to hurt an amazing person like my sister and I know that she knows better than me and even though its just a small thing, I don‘t want to disappoint her. I also feel guilty because I was surely an exhausting sibling in the past and think I should just suck it up. But on the other hand I‘m genuinely afraid that I could destroy everyones fun when I get pissed because of my lousy performance and that Taylor could be mad at me for that.
I‘m sorry, its stupid I know, but AITA? 
",Not the A-hole,2024-07-28,"AITA for refusing to play games/sports I‘m not good at right now? Hey, Reddit. I guess I‘m just gonna jump straight into it. Apologies for mistakes, not a native English speaker.
So, I‘m 19M and I live with my sister „Taylor“ (24F) and my parents (50F and 64M). We are really close friends with our neighbor „Carmen“ (60ishF) who comes over at least once every week. We always cook or order food and eat it together and sometimes we also do other things like playing boardgames. A few days again, my Mom picked Table Tennis up again which was her favorite sport when she was younger and Taylor and Dad picked up Badminton again, which they also played a lot earlier. Carmen, Taylor and Dad also all play Table Tennis. I had TT once in school in PE but I was very bad (I think in the US the grade I got would be D-F).


I‘m autistic and also have motorical problems with my hands specifically. I can‘t do things as accurate as others and I‘m pretty clumsy. My mind is also…kinda fragile and I have very low self-esteem. I often consider myself undeserving of living a privileged life in a western country and I also sometimes had certain dark thoughts. (I‘m in therapy and working on that, Mom and Dad kinda know about that, Taylor doesn‘t).


The actual situation is that Taylor urged me to play Table Tennis and Badminton so we can do more things as a family together and its not bad if I play bad, it‘s about the game and having fun. Obviously, she‘s right with that and I have the same view. But, I have a bad phase again right now. Last week, our 16-year-old neighbour‘s dog (not Carmens dog) Venga was euthanized and I was with her in the last hours of her life. We all knew her since so long and it hit me really bad. So I think that if I play games right now were I perform badly, it will feed my insecurities and destroy my patience and in worst case I could have a meltdown which I want to avoid because my family doesn‘t deserve that. 


When I explained it to them, Carmen, Mom and Dad were understanding and Mom told me it‘s not bad, she loves me for who I‘m and I can wait until I‘m ready enough. But Taylor was visibly disappointed and said that I‘m not the only one affected by Vengas death and its sad I don‘t even want to do something so „banal“ for my family. That really hurt to be honest and I was shocked because I certainly don‘t see it that way.

Me(26M) and my wife (24F) didn't want kids especially her because of how she grew up with her abusive ultra religious parents and her 6 siblings. Well her little brother ""Danny"" (15M) was kicked out by their parents in March after he was outed by his Capital A abusive ex. She of course went and got him when she found out and he's been living with us for the time being.


It's been a struggle cause this kid is dealing with abuse and bulimia and drinking to cope.. I've had to change my whole life around to accommodate I even had to pour out all of my alcohol. I've been trying to just go with it cause I know it's a shitty situation and I thought it was gonna be a lil while. But now I'm driving him to and from therapy sessions, and just recently my wife is looking at schools for him and it's all so much. I try not to show it but I can't tell Danny realizes I don't like it much because he said something to my wife about thinking I didn't like him.

She confronted me about it last night and I just told her it was a lot and she sprung this on me. I asked if she had any other family he could go with.She gets mad and says maybe a kinda tolerant Aunt. I tell it's too much  and she yells at me that he needs help and I tell her I didn't agree to be a parent. She says I'm being heartless and I ended up on the couch.

","Genuinely want to know if I’m the asshole and whether I should reconsider my current stance on this. Fiance and I are 26 and have been together for 3 years, but have known each other much longer.



I’ve always leaned toward the minimalist side of things and rather purchase higher end and/or higher quality items that will last, but own less. I was raised in a very cluttered home and strongly prefer to have fewer but nicer items. So I’ve spent a lot of time and money cultivating an inventory of high quality items (in all aspects of my life, but especially kitchen things).



We don’t live together and still have a few months on our leases but will be moving in together soon. He’s been talking about how we need to rent a place with a lot of kitchen cabinets/storage space to store two sets of cookware, dishes, plus his appliances (doubles of what I have).



I asked him if we could go over both of our inventories and figure out what we do and don’t need before moving in together and what we can keep vs. getting rid of (for example, we don’t need two toaster ovens, electric kettles or blenders). He got upset and said that it’s good to have backups of everything in case something breaks.



I’m totally fine with backups of a few items, like an extra pot/pan, or glasses or similar, but the thought of having extras in the house of literally every single thing is causing me so much stress. He’s feeling frustrated that I want him to get rid of his items rather than me get rid of mine, but I’ve spent so much time and money on my items and his are primarily just generics or lower end.



Nothing wrong buying lower-end, but for example I don’t think it makes sense for me to get rid of my All-Clad cookware set in favor of a Walmart cookware set, and it doesn’t make sense to keep two sets of cookware. Or to keep a Mr. Coffee coffee maker when I have both an upscale espresso maker *and* a drip coffee machine.



This is applying to more than just the kitchen, but the kitchen stuff has been the biggest point of contention between us.



He’s frustrated as well because he’s used to having “backups,” it was how he was raised and the idea of not having extra things is stressing him out. As an example: when he went off to college, his mom bought him 6 sets of bedding and something like 8 towels.



We’ve been going back and forth on this issue a lot, and I’m wondering if I’m being too harsh about him getting rid of so many of his things. I’m definitely cool with a few duplicates, but in general the thought of having essentially two fully stocked kitchens moved into one house is causing me so much stress. But I don’t want him to feel like has to ditch almost everything of his own either.

62,1eeb1kq,AITA for refusing to lie on a scholarship application?,"I (18M) am going to university in a few weeks. All students in the university study tuition-free, and there are scholarships available for financial aid. For months, my mom has been pushing me not to disclose certain information in my scholarship application (my dad’s job, our permanent address) so I have a better chance of getting accepted.

I feel that we are somehow well-off compared to other families whose students may literally need the scholarships just to maintain a stable life. Both my parents agree that my chances of getting accepted if I do apply are slim because of this.

So naturally, I was completely against this idea because I have heard of many stories of people who really need needs-based scholarships to just get by, and I feel like by being dishonest, I would be taking away that opportunity from them. 

In the morning, my mom suggested the idea again and I told her that there are other scholarships that are not needs-based that I can apply for, and that I didn’t have to lie, such as merit-based scholarhips. She tried to convince me otherwise, but the conversation ended after that.

That day, my entire family (dad, brother, and mom) went on a trip to look for essentials to put in my apartment, which left us all tired. Before we got home, my mom suggested the idea again and I said the same things. It turned into a whole argument. She kept on suggesting not to write down all of our property in the application and 
when I argued that there are people who need it more than me, she would say why would I think about other people if they don’t even care about me.

At the time, I felt like I was simply arguing for my case but my mother said that my tone of voice was very disrespectful. 

At that point, it turned into an argument not about the scholarship but in the way I talk to my parents and how my tone whenever I talk to them is very disrespectful. My dad would try to explain to me that I shouldn’t talk that way to my mom, and I responded by asking my mom how she expects respect back if she can’t even respect my decision to not lie on a scholarship by asking me about it over and over.

At that point, I started saying that there are times when I felt her tone was rude too, and I’d been mentioning this a lot before this argument, and she responded by saying that she’s the parent so she should be respected no matter what. Even my dad agreed that her tone can be rude sometimes, but he said I should just try to understand my mom.

I really wasn’t trying to be disrespectful throughout the conversation and I really was just trying to say why I felt it was wrong to do what she had been suggesting for me to do for months now, but I acknowledge that my tone may have come out as rude.

63,1eeb0vp,AITA for choosing the same tattoo style as my ex?,"I’ve (27M) been with my current SO (25F) for almost 2 years. My ex and I broke up in 2021, and she had a bunch of tattoos. For years, I’ve been undecided on what kind of tattoo I’m going to get. I was bouncing around between getting a modest Star Wars or video-game style, but haven’t had my heart set on it. Recently, I went on pinterest to see what other styles are appropriate for a first tattoo. Then I came across the plant/leaves that go around your forearm. I was hooked immediately, more so than when I was debating whether I’d get a Darth Vader or a Geralt tattoo. 

Naturally, I relayed this news to my SO and told her I’d be getting that one for sure (she knows I’ve been thinking about getting a tattoo). She was upset. She went so far as to say, “it’s a reflection how I haven’t gotten over my breakup and subconsiously chose this.” “It’s the first thing your family and your friends will think about when they see it. It’s the same style as your ex”, she said. She also said, “I can’t look at you anymore knowing you would have that same tattoo as her. It’s insane why you would pick that.” 

I looked at it from her perspective. It may be the same style but not once did I think of my ex when I picked it. I told her, “I know it’s similar, but I promise this isn’t about her. It’s the first design I’ve felt so sure about.”

She retorts by saying, “I don’t even care anymore. If you do that, I don’t care. Call it weird or whatever. But that is reason enough for me to call it quits. I can’t stand looking at you and think you’re the same.” I replied, “Yes, I’m still thinking about getting it, but if you can’t take my word that it’s not about her or anyone other than myself, then that’s your call.” 

She promptly blocked me on text and socials.

","I (20M) am currently serving my one year mandatory military service. About a week ago, I learned I would get a vacation from the 26th of july to the 1st of august. When I told my mom (52F) this on the phone, she asked if I wanted to go on a vacation with her. I told her that sounded nice, but I had plans, there was a friend I was going to hang out with that I hadn't seen in a long time.

She got really curious about who this person was, asking if it was a girl. I told her (in a friendly manner) that I didn't want to answer that, and that it wasn't really any of her business (the truth is that it was a girl, but the exact status of our relationship is complicated, and I don't wanna talk about my dates to my parents before I've got an actual girlfriend). She didn't respect this, and asked like 3 more times over the course of the phone conversation. And she til didn't stop even after we hung up. Over the last week, she has asked me the same question on 6 seperate occasions, with me getting more irritated every time. I've explicitly told her to not ask anymore, to respect my decision not to share the information, but she doesn't care, and just says something along the lines of ""I'm your mother, I'm just curious and care about you."" I know I still technically live at home, but I'm 20 years old, spend most of my nights on the military camp, and plan on moving out only a few months after my service has ended, so I don't feel like owe her the details on this. Yesterday, she asked again, and started laughing when I got mad at her.

Today, I was at my dad's home, and got a call from my mom. She had already gone on the vacation she was planning, but had forgotten to put a soon-expiring chicken filet into the freezer, meaning it would go bad by the time she got home. She asked me to drive to her apartment and do it for her. I got into my car driving to her home while on the phone with her. Then, she asked again. I guess something in me just snapped. A week of frustration came at once, and I shouted loudly into the phone about how sick I was of her borderline harassment, and how many times she had asked this of me. She proceeded to hang up in the middle of my conversation. I sent her a text message that if she wanted me to do the chicken favour, she had to apologize for the past week, and promise to respect my boundaries from now on. She then answered a really long message about my reaction being unacceptable and ""How much she has done for me throughout my life."" She also said ""Fine, I will never ask you anything about your personal life ever again, just leave my alone."" The latter is clearly not what I asked of her. Realizing she wouldn't apologize or change her behaviour in the slightest, I sarcastically wrote to her that I hope the chicken smell that greets her when she gets home is pleasant. I'm not particularly proud of writing that, but I was tired of being nice at that point.

66,1ee9smz,AITA for parking in front of my neighbors house?,"Got yelled at by my neighbors for parking in front of their house and I need to see if AITA. 

Little FYI about my driveway. It comes off the street, runs along the side of my house, and then if I keep driving I can drive off the edge of the concrete and drive through my backyard into the alleyway. I don’t like doing that because the drop-off from the concrete to the grass is significant enough that I feel like it’s  not good for my pickup, plus it kills the grass in my yard from driving/parking on it. 

So I get home from work and park on the concrete in my driveway. My gf gets off work and pulls into the driveway behind me. If we go anywhere, I typically drive because I have the more reliable vehicle, so I hop off the concrete and drive through the backyard. When we get back for the night I don’t want to park behind her because she leaves for work before I do in the morning. So my options are either park in my backyard and kill the grass, or park in the street. I can’t park along my side of the street so I have to park in front of the neighbors across the street. 

Said neighbor came over around 10pm the other night and asked if we can park somewhere else because “her daughter mows a lot” and “I have to carry groceries into the house and I have to park farther away” and “we have to leave early for work and don’t like moving vehicles around just to get out of our driveway in the morning.” She also kept throwing out that she’s been a home owner there for 20+ years.

I explained to her my situation and told her that it’s a public road so I can park there if I want to. She was still persistent that we park elsewhere. 

Parked in the street last night and gave them enough room to park in front of their house and still got a middle finger from them as they left. AITA?

My MIL is generous when it comes to birthday presents. She’s known to spend 150-300€ for someone‘s (like her husband‘s, kids‘, grandkids‘) birthday. I am quite close to her. I was her caretaker after her brain-aneurysm incident in 2020. I drove her to her doctors appointments, helped her run errands and treated her wounds from her surgery, etc. She‘s the mother of my husband so it’s just natural that I’d help her whenever I can.

Long story short, I had to sell my ticket a month before the concert bcs we really needed the money. I am a student working part time to finance med school and my husband works full time to support us financially. At some point our dog got really sick and we also had to do some repairing on our car. We do have some money saved, but we were gonna use the money for our moving arrangements for my clinical rotation. So I sold my ticket the same price I bought it to be able to pay everything. I wasn‘t keeping it a secret, but I didn’t get the chance to tell my MIL that I wasn‘t going to the concert bc I was busy preparing for exams and got busy working. 

About a week before the concert I went to her house to water her plants and she was having a friend over and they were having a conversation. She asked me what date the concert is again and I told her that it‘s in exactly a week. I wanted to tell her then, that I wasn‘t going, but it would be too uncomfortable for me to tell her that I had to sell my ticket to be able to pay for other stuff, because I didn‘t want a stranger (her friend) to know and get involved in my personal matter, so I just answered her about the date of the concert. As I finished doing the work at her house, I told her and her friend that I was leaving, her friend said „have fun at the concert“ and I didn‘t know what else to say other than „oh, thank you so much“, and I left.

She texted me one day before the concert asking abt the concert and I told her I wasn‘t going and explained everything. She got really mad and called me a liar bc I didn‘t say anything about selling the ticket. It‘s been almost a week and we haven’t talked to each other since.

Nobody likes this girl, and the fact that she already caused so much problems and shows red flags. My mom thinks I am the asshole and I can’t control my emotion by snapping at this spoiled brats.

Also, I’m thinking not to take my brother for any types of business in the future, and I won’t come to their wedding. Because I clearly don’t support their relationship.

71,1ee8rrv,WIBTA for calling out my mother and stepfather's poor hygiene?,"Background: I married my husband in October and combined, we have 3 kids (10,9,&6). My mother and I have not had the best relationship because of my childhood. Part of that being that I had to handle all finances, shopping, cooking, cleaning, and laundry from about age 11, and ended up a ward of the state at 15 aging out of foster care at 18 because she abandoned me and went to another state. There are much worse things, but for the sake of this post, that's the important part. 

Anyway, I have been in contact with my mother off and on for years. Recently, she called saying the house they rent was without power or water and it would take several days to fix.

We offered for them to stay with us because they are elderly with a lot of health issues and NO ONE should have to live like that. While they packed, there was a round of drama with a neighbor they had been having problems with and the landlord kicked them out. They get here and it is clear they have not bathed FOR AWHILE we suggested that since they had been all day in a hot house moving around a lot, that hot showers might make them feel better and soothe their muscles. There is a stench, on them and on the things they brought with them. I immediately started washing their belongings.

The following day, we went down there with my stepfather (city about an 1 1/2 south of us) to help gather some of their things. The house is in HORRIBLE shape. We grabbed two cars full of salvageable items, we only allowed clothing and bedding to come to the house and I immediately washed EVERYTHING. I had to run my mother a bath and insist she go soak to get her to bathe, after DAYS of subtle suggestions. I had to run a hot shower for my stepfather saying the same thing. I had to change and wash their sheets because they smelled and someone had had diarrhea and just left the dirty sheets on the bed. That bath and shower I ran for each of them is the last one they have taken and it has been nearly two weeks. Being subtle isn't working anymore, and we are CONSTANTLY having to clean up after them and the cats they brought with them. Changing cat liter, sweeping liter off the floor, mopping the floor, changing their bedding, washing their clothes, removing trash from the room and other random places they leave it. I'm exhausted, my husband is exhausted, and we are both sensitive to smell.

We want to tell them that their personal hygiene as well as the way they keep up their space and common spaces needs to improve for the length of time that they are here. (We gave them a 60 day deadline to find new accommodations). But WIBTA if I called them out on their poor hygiene and self-care?

TLDR- My mother and stepfather are staying with us and do not bathe regularly or pick up after themselves, I might be the YTA because I want to call out the smell and tell them we can't accept poor hygiene while they stay in our house.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-28,"WIBTA for calling out my mother and stepfather's poor hygiene?

72,1ee8hrj,AITA for ignoring my parents when they don’t refer to me by my middle name?,"I, 15f, was born physically disabled (this is relevant) with a highly uncommon, biblical name. My mother chose it by, quite literally, opening a bible and choosing the first word she saw.
The name in question is considered to be more masculine, as well as very outdated. Due to this (and my disability), I’ve been bullied for most of my life. My name has been constantly made fun of, purposefully mispronounced and even been used as an excuse to misgender me.
About two months ago, I made the decision to go by my middle name. I respectfully asked everyone around me to use it, and for the most part, people did. The bullying died down and I felt a lot happier with a more feminine name. However, my parents (59m, 50F) are still referring to me by my first name.
When I explained to them why I wanted to go by my middle name, they claimed that I’d always be bullied due to my disability and that a name change wouldn’t prevent anything. They also said that, since they were old, they “shouldn’t be expected to put in the effort of referring to me as something else”, as it’d cause them unnecessary stress. My mother was also particularly upset about me going by my middle name, as she believed that I was, in a way, betraying god by no longer using a biblical name.
My parents also argued that they’d only call me by my first name at home, so it shouldn’t affect me.
However, over the next month, they kept using my first name. Each time they used it, I was reminded of the constant bullying I put up with throughout my life. So, I had the idea to simply not respond to them, or say “that’s not my name” every time they used my first name. It worked at first. However, they now either mock me, grumble, or complain to me that I’m overreacting.

73,1ee81y9,AITA for refusing to meet my dad’s girlfriend ,"So this all started a couple weeks ago, my dad had reconnected with this girl from school and they had started to casually date long distance, she will come to our state and visit our house for about a week, and then she leaves. The second my dad mentioned her I was immediately disinterested in meeting her. This would be my dad’s 4th significant other that I had to live with. 

The reason I refuse to meet her is because I believe that the relationship will not last. Because all of his relationships have ended abruptly. This also goes for my mother’s side of the family, collectively both of my parents have had so many partners and they break up within such a short timeframe that I have stopped investing time, effort and energy into any of these relationships and have decided to completely ignore them.

When she does come over I stay in my room and don’t come out unless she’s out of the house completely. When my dad confronted me about this, I told him that I didn’t like of his girlfriend and he immediately lost his shit saying that I had no right to treat her like that and that I was being an asshole. 

Many other times he has tried to get me to meet her but I decline every time. One day he decided to offer me to come with him and his girlfriend to the Wisconsin Dells (a water park and resort) and I initially declined but he told me I could bring a friend and we could do our own thing. I accepted. However a day before the trip he asked me to babysit her kids while we were at the park, which lead me to cancel on him the day we were gonna leave. When I told him I wasn’t going to go if I had to watch her kids, he flipped out, turned the car around and started going on a rant about how I didn’t love him and I’m doing this to hurt his feelings, which he followed up with that I hated him.

74,1ee7i3u,AITA for telling my younger nephew to leave his brother alone?,"My brother has three kids. Jay (15m) with his ex. Leo (12m) and Esme (9f) with his wife. Jay's mom left my brother and Jay when he was only 1. She was in and out of his life for a few years after that. Until he was maybe 7. Then she stopped all contact with Jay. My brother and his wife met not long after Jay's mom left. So she's been around since Jay was maybe 19 or 20 months old. Jay has never called her mom and their relationship is awkward, to best describe it. And Leo has taken it upon himself to ""fix"" it for them. By that I mean he tries to correct Jay whenever he calls his stepmom by her name, when he says she's his stepmom or she's married to his dad to others.

Leo has scolded Jay for calling his mom his mom while not calling his stepmom mom. Leo has corrected Jay in front of others. He tells him he's a bad kid and their parents are going to send him away. My brother and his wife let Leo get away with this. He has said it in front of other family before and when anyone speaks up to defend Jay or tell Leo to be nice to Jay, my brother will say to leave it alone and it's just ""their thing"".

I have talked to him before and I told him I don't think it's helping anyone letting that dynamic grow between them. My brother told me nothing would help since Jay has said he wants his mom and not his stepmom. He told me they don't love that but even with therapy Jay still wants only the woman who left him and not the woman who stepped up.

I had the boys for a sleepover last weekend while my brother and his wife took Esme to a concert. While they were staying at my house Leo heard me and Jay talk and Jay was confiding in me about things, about his mom and his family and how much he hated Leo correcting him and upsetting his dad and stepmom. Leo comes in and starts correcting him and saying how it's all his fault for dismissing their mom and how his mom doesn't want him and to get over it. I told Leo to stop and leave his brother alone because he's being unkind and he's not going to convince Jay by talking to him that way. Leo said I should be helping him and stormed off to his room for the night.

My brother told me I shouldn't have corrected Leo. Though he had less heat than I expected. Leo told me I suck as an aunt.

She kept repeating that I don't appreciate anything she does. After a while, I couldn't take it anymore and went upstairs to my room.

76,1ee78gt,AITA for telling my daughter that she's ruining her life?,"I (49F) recently got into an argument with my newly 19F daughter about the way she's living her life. Now, she lives on her own, pays her own bills, apparently has a job and a social life. She could definitely be doing much worse, but unfortunately her living situation does not end there.

Since she moved out, we have talked about how she spends her days and lives her life. Apparently, most nights when she's not out with friends she's getting wine drunk by herself alone in her apartment. She apparently thought it was funny; I did not agree. And the nights when she is out she's also getting drunk, only much more so and with her friends. She didn't get into the university she wanted so she's taking a gap year. She didn't study nearly as much as she should have, and from what I've understood she doesn't have intention to put in any more work the next time around.

It doesn't even end at unhealthy habits. Last winter she was detained by the police while on a night out because she and her friends had been fighting with the staff at a night club. Before that, in the autumn of 2023, she had been found guilty of petty fraud. (Gave false info to the social security agency to get more money)

I confronted her about the way she lives her life a few days ago while I was delivering cake I'd baked for her for her birthday. I told her that she needs to get her life together, stop drinking excessively often, getting into pointless petty legal troubles, try to get a hold of her life so she could actually make something of herself, make a better life for herself than what my husband and I have. To stop ruining the potential she has, stop sabotaging her own life before she ruins it and it's too late. She got surprisingly angry at me, telling me I have no business telling her anything since she's an adult who lives on her own, pays her own bills and lives her own life according to her terms. She told me that if I wanted her to live her life in better ways, my husband & I should have given her a better life.

TL;DR: My 19F daughter got angry at me after I confronted her on her hazardous and unhealthy lifestyle and told her that she has to stop ruining her own life.

I (49F) recently got into an argument with my newly 19F daughter about the way she's living her life. Now, she lives on her own, pays her own bills, apparently has a job and a social life. She could definitely be doing much worse, but unfortunately her living situation does not end there.

Since she moved out, we have talked about how she spends her days and lives her life. Apparently, most nights when she's not out with friends she's getting wine drunk by herself alone in her apartment. She apparently thought it was funny; I did not agree. And the nights when she is out she's also getting drunk, only much more so and with her friends. She didn't get into the university she wanted so she's taking a gap year. She didn't study nearly as much as she should have, and from what I've understood she doesn't have intention to put in any more work the next time around.

It doesn't even end at unhealthy habits. Last winter she was detained by the police while on a night out because she and her friends had been fighting with the staff at a night club. Before that, in the autumn of 2023, she had been found guilty of petty fraud. (Gave false info to the social security agency to get more money)

I confronted her about the way she lives her life a few days ago while I was delivering cake I'd baked for her for her birthday. I told her that she needs to get her life together, stop drinking excessively often, getting into pointless petty legal troubles, try to get a hold of her life so she could actually make something of herself, make a better life for herself than what my husband and I have. To stop ruining the potential she has, stop sabotaging her own life before she ruins it and it's too late. She got surprisingly angry at me, telling me I have no business telling her anything since she's an adult who lives on her own, pays her own bills and lives her own life according to her terms. She told me that if I wanted her to live her life in better ways, my husband & I should have given her a better life.

82,1ee5tgk,AITA for not ordering any food so I wouldn't have to split the bill?,"I(27M) have been apart of a small friend group, around 8 people total, basically since college.

For some background, 2 people from the group, Susan and Greg, are just absolute leeches. Going out for lunch? Expect them to order the most expensive on the menu then feed you some sob story about their finances and then dumb half the bill on you.

Last weekend, Dan, one of the people from the group, told me about a casual dinner . I told him how if Susan or Greg were there I wouldn't be able to come. He tells me that they would be there but I should just put my opinions aside and come just once.

This is kind of where I might be an AH. I agreed with him and told him I would be there. I show up and we all get to talking.

Everyone began putting in their orders, most of them spent about $40. There were only about 6 people there. When it gets to Susan and Greg, they both order expensive dishes, around $200. When it was my turn to order, everyone looked at me, but I just pick up the menu and point to the $4 Miller Lite and sent the waiter away. Dan asked why I hadn't ordered anything and all I said was that I lost my appetite. The other 2 friends got up as well to cancel their orders and just have drinks.

After the main courses came out, I saw Susan and Greg picking at their food. The waiter then brings over the check. Greg then grabs the waiter and asks him to split the check 6 ways. I stand up and correct him saying the check was to be split 3 ways. Greg looks at me confused and asks why since we ""always"" split the bill. I reminded him that 3 of us had not eaten any food so we would just be paying for our drinks.  So basically at the end of the night, Dan, who probably only ate around $50 worth of food, was stuck with a $146.98 check at the end. (Yes, I remember the exact number.) I swear I saw his jaw drop when he picked that receipt up.

I slid a $10 towards the check, said goodbye everyone, and walked out.

The next morning, I found my phone full of texts from Greg and Susan telling me I was an AH for not ordering any food and forcing them to pay  more than they had accounted for. I honestly laughed because the steaks alone were more than what they had paid  but to each their own right?

I also got a lot of messages from Dan saying that I could have just not came instead of pulling that stunt and getting him stuck with an outrageous bill.

Edit: At this restaurant, the bar is separate so drinks are on a separate bill if that makes sense. And if anyone is concerned about leaving a tip, I live in Australia.

Edit 2: Hey guys just wanted to clarify some things:

1. 90% of restaurants where I live they don't do separate checks and might separate the bill for you if you're lucky. BTW. This post is in AUD, so if you want the amounts in USD, you have to convert it.
2. Dan could have easily asked Greg and Susan to transfer him the money if he wanted but he's always been about helping them through their ""financial hardship"" even though they're just using him and keeps dragging me into it. I admit what I did was immature but I'm tired of being forced to play along. It's his money and if he wants to spend it on them, that's fine, but I'm not paying for them.
3. Also Dan's a really good friend of mine, albeit blind AF. I was just trying to get him to see what kind of people he was ""helping"". I will admit it was a tad bit petty.

85,1ee4zke,AITA for keeping my roommate for college despite my parents’ wishes?,"I (18F) am starting college this fall. Earlier this summer, I filled out my housing application and waited to hear who my roommate might be and what hall I would live in. Earlier in the school year, a good friend of mine (18M) suggested that we should apply to be roommates. For a little more context he is a very gay man and I am a very gay woman. I thought it’d be a fun idea but we missed the deadline for roommate selection so we just got thrown into the random pool. 

Come mid-July, I get a call from my mom letting me know that housing assignments got released a few days early. I check my account and, coincidentally, my roommate is my friend. I didn’t tell my mother right at that moment because I knew she’d likely freak out when she heard the news. A few days later, I told her, and she wasn’t happy. She said that there’s something wrong with me if I’m comfortable sleeping in the same room as a man, that I don’t actually know him, and that I shouldn’t be okay undressing in the same room as him (we have communal bathrooms so that isn’t a problem). She said I have to submit a room change form as soon as the form is released. A few weeks prior I had a conversation with my parents about being 18 and they affirmed that I am technically an adult and should make my own decisions. I brought this up, and she said fine, but you have to tell your dad yourself. 

About a week later I told my dad and all he said was that as long as my grades are good he doesn’t care. About a week after that, my parents simultaneously blew up, degrading both me and my friend, and telling me that I don’t care about them. My mom said that if I keep my roommate, she will not be able to sleep peacefully at night and heart problems will appear, and that it will be a clear indication as to whether I care about my parents. I had a long list of reasons as to why I should keep my roommate as well as my room, such as close proximity to classes and a preference for the residence hall. The only downside she could identify was my roommate being a boy, I was expecting her to at least acknowledge the pros I gave her but that was not the case. 

The next morning, I get an email from an administrator in housing explaining that she has a couple questions for me. I call the number she left and come to find out, my mom called numerous administrators as well as other staff to try and get me moved to a different room or get my roommate placed elsewhere. I was upset about this as my mom has a long history of going behind my back and doing things her way, but I told the administrator that I wanted to keep my room. She said that she’ll put it on my file to only contact me, as my school prefers to speak to students about student issues.
 
My parents really locked down on the decision being indicative of how much I care about their feelings. Should I have caved and changed rooms?
",Not the A-hole,2024-07-28,"AITA for keeping my roommate for college despite my parents’ wishes? I (18F) am starting college this fall. Earlier this summer, I filled out my housing application and waited to hear who my roommate might be and what hall I would live in. Earlier in the school year, a good friend of mine (18M) suggested that we should apply to be roommates. For a little more context he is a very gay man and I am a very gay woman. I thought it’d be a fun idea but we missed the deadline for roommate selection so we just got thrown into the random pool. 

Come mid-July, I get a call from my mom letting me know that housing assignments got released a few days early. I check my account and, coincidentally, my roommate is my friend. I didn’t tell my mother right at that moment because I knew she’d likely freak out when she heard the news. A few days later, I told her, and she wasn’t happy. She said that there’s something wrong with me if I’m comfortable sleeping in the same room as a man, that I don’t actually know him, and that I shouldn’t be okay undressing in the same room as him (we have communal bathrooms so that isn’t a problem). She said I have to submit a room change form as soon as the form is released. A few weeks prior I had a conversation with my parents about being 18 and they affirmed that I am technically an adult and should make my own decisions. I brought this up, and she said fine, but you have to tell your dad yourself. 

About a week later I told my dad and all he said was that as long as my grades are good he doesn’t care. About a week after that, my parents simultaneously blew up, degrading both me and my friend, and telling me that I don’t care about them. My mom said that if I keep my roommate, she will not be able to sleep peacefully at night and heart problems will appear, and that it will be a clear indication as to whether I care about my parents. I had a long list of reasons as to why I should keep my roommate as well as my room, such as close proximity to classes and a preference for the residence hall. The only downside she could identify was my roommate being a boy, I was expecting her to at least acknowledge the pros I gave her but that was not the case.

86,1ee4sa3,AITA for asking my coworker to not eat tuna in the break room?,"So... I am very pregnant right now. Still in the first trimester, but rhe symptoms HIT.

I am nauseaus all day and i cant eat anything warm really, i have been living on cold sandwiches and fruits, because that is all my body can tolerate right now. My sense of smell is also hightened. 

So, my coworker loves tuna. He eats everything with tuna, specifically a spanish brand with tomate puree in it. I used to like it, before i was pregnant, even though the smell is quite... strong. 

The problem is he doesnt keep the tuna refrigerated, he literally pulls it out of his work bag, and especially in the summer, he stinks everything up. 

Usually i do notice but i can manage, but lately, i cant stay around that smell. I have barfed way more than i wanted to admit. 

Yesterday, after I came back from my barfing i asked him if he could please eat something else. My throat is hurting from barfing everyday and i just cant anymore 

Dude got red in the face and left the breakroom ( he left his tuna too). 

Now people are calling me an assshole, they told me i am not entitled to dictate what someene else eats. 

I tried to explain, but apparently hr is also involved too. 

So was I really the AH?

Edit : thank you all for your judgements. It's pretty clear I am TA. I still would like to provide some info, as my hr meeting already passed. I forgot to mention some things in the heat of the moment. 

1. There is a general consensus in our break room to not heat up fish and to not eat stinky stuff. I don't know why this apparently doesn't appeal to my coworker and he had never gotten introuble because of that. 

2. I have absolutely no problems with this coworker. Yes, I should have been much more sensitive and ask nicely, I did ask him once before if he could refrigerate his tuna so the smell wouldn't be overpowering. It was still an assshole move to do infront of my coworkers. I should have asked him again privately. And of course, my sensitivity to smell is not his problem. I just snapped. I did apologize to him. 

3. We only have the break room. I cant go anywhere else, cause this is my part time airport job. We are not allowed to eat on the ramp or in the plane, even if it's empty. The break room is inside the security area, because that is where I had to work today. Nowhere else to go. Literally. 

4. HR did dismiss the complaint my coworker made. I apologized to him and explained everything to him and that I snapped. He said my pregnancy was not his problem, HR said he shouldn't have eaten tuna in the break room doesn't matter if I am pregnant or not, many people did complain apparently directly with HR.

90,1ee3c29,AITA for telling my sister I can't tell her what to do and she needs to figure things out for herself?,"My sister asked me the other day if she should get married to her partner of 5 years. This question didn't come out of nowhere, per se. But I never expected her to ask me that either. This is something she has been weighing for over a year now. And I'll give some background about this and why I gave my answer. But my answer was that I can't tell her what to do and she needs to figure it out for herself.

My sister has a son who's now 14 and a daughter who's now 12. Their father/her first husband is dead. But that's also very complicated. In the final few years of his life he went off the rails and he was a shitty husband and a very imperfect father. My sister was done with the marriage by the time he passed. But the kids have never stopped loving him and they miss him like crazy. To this day they celebrate his birthday and do something to mark the day he passed each year. My sister helps them where she can but it's typically just the kids.

My sister met her partner 5 years ago and they introduced their kids to each other 4 years ago and have been slowly trying to make a nice little blended family. But the kids on both sides are not super thrilled. I won't say they're behaving badly. None have shown a willingness or an interest in bonding together. They behave just fine. My sister has said it's like sitting in a room full of anxious introverts when both families come together and she and her partner have to lead all conversation.

They started going to family therapy a year ago but it wasn't helpful. Until the therapist separated them to parent + bio kids they got more openness from them. Her partner's kids want him to wait for their mom to come back and they won't ever be okay with him marrying someone else. And they'll never agree to be a family. My sister's kids said they don't mind her getting married but they don't want it to make them a family and they don't want to have a relationship with her partner that's more than just hi and bye. My sister asked why and they said because of their dad. They would never replace him or move on from him like that because they love him but they know she didn't love him and he didn't love her, when he died. They told her they really don't need or want to grow the family in the way she does. But they will accept her growing hers through marriage.

My sister has talked about this for a while with me. She doesn't want to get married and have her kids on one side and a husband on the other and his kids on another side. But she loves her partner. She also understands that the lack of desire to be a family, even just friendly family, is not something either set of kids wants. I understand this is a lot for her. But I felt the decision would be better coming from her because if I make it for her, and she regrets it, she could hate/blame me. I think working through it with a therapist could help her decide what would make her happiest. But my sister told me she needs my help and I'm denying her.

95,1ee2mg8,AITA for not letting my friend's dog stay at my house while she's away?,"I (22F) have a close friend, Emma (23F), who frequently travels for her job. She has a dog named Buddy, who is a sweet but very energetic Husky. I have watched Buddy for her in the past, but it was hard work. He usually scared my pet cat, Mittens, who does not have good relationships with dogs. It has bothered me for a while now that he kept scaring Mittens, and it just wasn't sitting right with me.

Recently, Emma asked me to watch Buddy for two weeks. I thought about it, but I just didn't think it was something I wanted to deal with at this moment. I ultimately decided to say no. I told her it was too much of a hassle, especially with Mittens, and that I also have a busy schedule. I suggested some places she could take her dog instead, but she declined my help. I didn't get any note of where Buddy ended up going; all I knew was that my advice was not listened to.

Emma seemed extremely upset and said she thought she could rely on me as a friend. She mentioned how Buddy loved staying at my place and how my advice would stress Buddy out. I felt kind of guilty, but I still stood by my decision. I didn't really think it was my problem, and I was not trying to be rude, but it was just a lot to deal with, and Mittens was at her breaking point with Buddy.

After the conversation with Emma, she stopped talking to me as often, and mutual friends have told me that she has been complaining about what happened and said something like I abandoned her when she needed help. Now I am starting to wonder if I should have just agreed to watch Buddy.

96,1ee2k6i,AITA for telling my friend Im no longer being her piggy bank? ,"Me (17 , f) and my friend (18 , f) haven’t known each other for long. We became close pretty quick. We met through one of my childhood friends. We are all in a friend group, but me and this friend specifically are closer than the rest. 

I have my own nail business and make good money. My friend on the other hand doesn’t have a job. I don’t mind one bit splurging on people I am close to. Especially since she doesn’t make money. Mixing business and friends is really hard and awkward. I still charge my friends but i charge them very little. I do this so I am making some profit, since some of my friends are regulars. They use up a lot of product and it’s not cheap to buy. Since my friend doesn’t have income, i told her i would give her ONE free nail set. For context, every time we go out I always pay for her. No one forces me to, but i love to have a good time and I love to go above and beyond for my friends.  I understand not being capable to reciprocate the same way I do. You would expect to at least be a good friend in other ways.

She wasn’t. I would ask for the most simplest favor that did not include any money, and there would always be a “but”. There’s not being able to and not wanting to. She didn’t want to. I felt bad because I would give my all to receive nothing in return. When i offered the free nail set, she expected the rest of the nails she got to be free. I had told her that she was going to need to pay me. Every time I would bring it up she would dismiss me. At this time she had also owed me money.

97,1ee22mx,AITA for refusing to share the food I brought back?,"I (F19) went to a restaurant for lunch. They had extra food, so I got a takeout box with leftovers. When I came home, I told my mom I wanted to eat this for lunch in the future. I also said she could eat some since there was a lot of shrimp and pumpkin (which I don’t like). She said I could eat it for dinner but I told her I was full and wouldn’t be eating dinner.

Later, I was about to nap and I heard her talking to my older brother and telling him he could eat what I brought home and she would cook something else for herself. I was about to fall asleep, so I didn’t want to get out of bed and tell them otherwise, and I thought there would be a chance he wouldn’t eat it.

I wake up from my nap and find out that what's left in the takeout box are scraps of food that’s mostly pumpkin. I got upset and asked my mom who ate the food, and she said she ate it. I confronted her about it and she later said it was my brother and her who both ate it. I asked why she omitted my brother at first and she said “Well I also ate it.”

I asked why she would offer him the food I brought home that I specifically told her I wanted to save for myself, and she argued that because we’re family we should share. She said that when she brings back food from her company, she offers it to us first, but I said that’s because she brought it specifically to share. She started screaming at me that if I didn’t want to share the food I brought back home I was selfish and should do some self-reflection.

My argument is that:

1. My brother goes out to eat for lunch often and never buys me food. This means he has a way to go out for lunch (car) while I always cook food from what's left in the fridge. And as mentioned previously, he would also probably not like it if I touched his leftovers. He used to work at an ice cream place and would specifically mention if he brought an ice cream back we were allowed to eat, otherwise what he brought back was his to eat. But my mom did say if I ate his leftovers and he had a problem with it, she would take it up with him.
2. I think it’s not within my mom's right to offer the food I brought back on my behalf to someone else, especially since I told her beforehand I wanted to save it. And also because I just want to eat better food for lunch.
3. My brother did not HAVE to eat the food I brought back. My mom cooked dinner, and he could’ve gone without eating the food. My mom’s argument is “Well someone just happened to want to eat it so you have to share it.”

I think the main reason why I’m upset is because she lied at first, maybe because she knew I would be upset. And she’s also insisting that I’m wrong for not wanting to share when we’ve never enforced this precedent in the first place.

I have never liked my situation at home, I grew up with my parents and my brother, and even though I have always had my needs covered and ultimately had my parents' support, the dynamics have always been toxic in many ways. If I dare to question the situation or refuse to participate in those dynamics, I am labeled as cold-hearted and that I don't want to help family.

Additionally, being part of the LGBTQA+ community, I don't feel save and free in my own country.

102,1ee197u,AITA for telling my roommate to move out within two weeks from today?,"Memorial Day weekend I(24f) signed a lease with my best friend (30m) and it’s quickly become the worst mistake I’ve made. 
We’ve been talking about this for 6+ months, but were waiting for his lease to end at his old place. This is my first time moving out of family homes, so I was excited to finally have a somewhat independant place to call home. The apartment we moved into is… not the greatest, but it’s 2 bedroom 2 bath, in unit laundry, all for a not horrible price. 

We moved in, and about a week later he told me he decided he was going to start trade school July 1st. Awesome! I’m happy for him for doing something to better his situation. The downside though, is that the school is about 35 minutes away, and he didn’t want to make that commute, so during the week while he’s in school, he stays with his mom who lives about 10 minutes from the school. While he was telling me this, he told me he had no problem paying his half of the rent while in school. Well fast forward to about 3 weeks ago, he told me he doesn’t actually think he can afford to pay half and tried to negotiate paying a lesser amount since he isn’t even home most of the time. 

I was upset, because he signed a lease with me, and made a commitment to pay X amount regardless of whether or not he’s in school. I told him I would rather him move out so I could find another roommate to help me with bills, he agreed, but then we never really spoke much more about it. 

Last week, I had a talk with one of my childhood friends and proposed her moving in because her lease is up soon, and she’s freshly graduated and starting a new career path and needs something budget friendly. Tonight, she confirmed she wants to move in and said she’d be coming the weekend of August 10th. 

I texted my roommate and told him I know its short notice and stressful, but that I need him out by that weekend. He BLEWWWWWWW UP on me and told me I was horrible and he needed a 30 day notice and that I tanked our friendship. Personally I think he wronged me by bailing on our commitment 1 month in, and that I was gracious enough for him to store his stuff in my place without paying any rent. 

AITA for telling him he needs to leave?",Everyone Sucks,2024-07-28,"AITA for telling my roommate to move out within two weeks from today? Memorial Day weekend I(24f) signed a lease with my best friend (30m) and it’s quickly become the worst mistake I’ve made. 
We’ve been talking about this for 6+ months, but were waiting for his lease to end at his old place. This is my first time moving out of family homes, so I was excited to finally have a somewhat independant place to call home. The apartment we moved into is… not the greatest, but it’s 2 bedroom 2 bath, in unit laundry, all for a not horrible price. 

We moved in, and about a week later he told me he decided he was going to start trade school July 1st. Awesome! I’m happy for him for doing something to better his situation.

105,1ee0r56,AITA for Turning Off the Internet When I Go to Bed?,"Hi everyone,

I'm a 40-year-old single (female) parent of two teenagers, Alex (13) and Jamie (14) Not there real names. They both have a group of friends who often come over to our house to hang out, especially during weekends. I work a demanding job, so I usually have to be up early in the morning, and I value my sleep.

For the past few months, I've been turning off our home's internet router at 10 PM. This decision was made because I noticed my kids staying up way too late on school nights, affecting their performance at school and their overall mood. I thought it was a reasonable compromise to ensure they get enough rest. 

However, this has not gone over well with Alex, Jamie, or their friends. I've heard them complain that I'm being overly strict and that I'm ruining their fun. Apparently, they like to stay up late chatting, gaming, and watching videos together. Recently, one of Alex's friends even called me ""a control freak"" for enforcing this rule.

It's not just about school nights, though. Even on weekends, I stick to the 10 PM cutoff because I want the kids to build healthy habits and not be glued to screens all night. I do allow occasional exceptions for special events, like movie nights or sleepovers, but those are rare.

My kids have been arguing that their friends' parents don't have such strict rules, and they feel embarrassed and singled out. They claim that they're old enough to manage their own bedtime and that I'm being unreasonable. Alex even said that his friends are starting to avoid coming over because of my ""crazy rules.""

I don't want to be the ""bad guy,"" but I genuinely believe that turning off the internet at a reasonable hour is in their best interest. I also worry about the potential risks of unsupervised late-night internet usage.

106,1ee0q2s,AITA for insulting someone’s appearance?,"Hi. Recently, I (16f) was at a school function and had to sit next to two boys, 'Mike' and 'Adam'. Throughout the event, they kept loudly badmouthing everyone who appeared on stage. I suppose they thought they were being witty, but it was getting over the top to the point where nearby parents were giving us looks.

At one point, a friend of mine went on stage to give a speech. Adam said, “God, she looks like a grandma.” 

I got really pissed off. Up until then, he hadn’t commented on anyone’s appearance, but this was very low in my opinion. I turned to him and said, “and I'd say you look like a monkey, but that would be a huge insult to monkeys.”

He looked surprised for a moment, and I told him to keep his f***ing mouth shut about other people. He called me a b**** and told me to mind my own business, to which I just rolled my eyes and said, ""How original.""

I don’t regret telling him to keep his mouth shut, but I do regret the part about saying he looks like a monkey. I felt like I stooped to his level, and I don’t want to be the reason someone has insecurities. I also felt like I was really immature. I’m not confrontational at all, but I know how it feels to be insecure and feel like everyone’s judging you when you’re putting yourself out ther, so his comment about my friend made me unusually mad. But now I feel bad for the comment about his appearance.

My sister lives very far from me, and he lives close by to her, and I don’t like driving out there without having had a plan before hand.

So I asked him how he expected me to go over there with only a Day’s notice. He said he would pick me up. So obviously I asked at what time would he be back to take me home? Because by my logic, if you have plans at 7pm, you’re not coming home til late in the night.

and my suspension was confirmed when he said “idk, 9 or 10 o’clock” which was way too vague for me. Like he can’t even tell me when he’ll be back and leave me stranded at my sisters. (Which he has done before)

So I told him No.

and he got all pissy at me and was like “it’s not like you have plans, dont complain when you don’t see the babies as often then” which really annoyed me because it’s not my fault I can’t drop what I’m doing to go see the babies and my sister all the time. since it’s such an inconvenient drive over and gas ain’t cheap.

so I told him he should have been more responsible about keeping track of his schedule and not make promises he can’t keep because he messed up and wanted me to bail him out so last minute.

My (34m) ex (24f) broke up with me 3 weeks ago. Prior to this, her mom had bought me/my ex/ herself/2 other friends first class Delta tickets via some Costco travel package to Hawaii to show her appreciation for us helping her/my ex with their house move. I was unavailable when they called me to ask me if they should because I was working. 

They later told me and I was grateful for the gift. I've never flown first class. I agreed to go. I was looking forward to this trip with my gf, her mom, their two family friends.

114,1edzlsk,AITA for offering a spoon more than once?,"I (26f) live with my significant other (26m). This situation happened not even an hour ago so please bear with me, my brain and heart is just all over the place right now. 

Tonight had been going well, and I couldn't see this coming from a mile away. I was sitting on the couch while he was in the kitchen. I hear him say ""great"" in a sarcastic irritated tone. He then comes out with a pudding cup, and a fork. 

I see he has a fork and I think about how pretty much every spoon we have (which isn't many at the moment) is sitting in the sink needing to be washed. And I know he eats pudding with a spoon, not a fork. So I ask him if he wants me to get him a spoon. He just says no without even looking at me. I hold up one I had just finished using on a cup of oranges, and ask if he wants to use it since it's not stained with anything and relatively clean. He snaps and asks how it's clean when I just used it, so I told him okay it's not ""clean"" but- and he cuts me off to say no. I say I can go wash it real quick, I don't mind. He practically yells no at me. 

I got upset that he raised his voice and asked why he was mad at me. That lit the fuse. He started yelling at me that I don't respect him. Over and over again he screams I don't have a single ounce of respect for him. He knocks a cup over, spilling it, and continues going on saying that ""no means no"". I was in such shock and I tried saying ""I was just trying to help"" and he cut me off by saying ""no you weren't, helping would be shutting the fuck up after the first time you asked. You weren't trying to help, you were just trying to make me do what you wanted me to do"". 

I tried saying that I just knew he would rather eat his pudding with a spoon versus a fork and was trying to make him happy, nothing more. He yelled that I ""always do this"" and I asked how and what he meant, but he just snapped that ""I know how"" and he just yelled again that I didn't respect him in the slightest bit, to leave him alone, and told me to go fuck myself.

I really am in tears right now. I don't know if what I did was genuinely wrong. I really was just trying to make him happy, I wasn't trying to disrespect him or push his buttons or anything. I wasn't trying to ""make him do what I want"". Why would I want to force him to use a spoon? Like, what would I gain from that? I was just offering to get him one because I knew he'd be irritated having to use a fork, and wanted to be nice.

 Should I not have tried offering to get him one after the first time he said no? Did I say or do something that would make it come off as manipulative or something?  I was wanting to offer it because I knew that's what he prefers and wanted him to be happy. I guess I can see it being irritating saying no more than once, but I didn't think it would be that offensive. Please give me some outside opinions on this, I'm going nuts and I feel awful.

(Around May) I take over the managing payments, i learn that MIL doesn't have anything close to paying rent so I take it upon myself to pay the missing 800 (rent and bills are about 1050)with the agreement of MIL and BIL paying me back, but to prioritize getting back on their feet so they can support themselves.

MIL finds another job after another few weeks and i again pay 800 to help them. This brings us to the end of June where i ask in the group chat with MIL, BIL, and I on June 27 (This will be verbatim)

June 27th

ME -Just checking to see if yall will have rent on time

MIL I will be a week late tbh but i will have it all

ME Okay

Fast Forward to Friday July 5th one pay week later

July 5th

We talk on the phone and she says she will now need until the 12th because they still doesn't have rent

MIL Ok, i said Monday but please dont talk to me like im a child

116,1edz8gp,AITA for going off on my family after a concert?,"My (28F) sister (26F) bought tickets back in December for us to go see Hozier in concert. We went tonight with our friend, our mom, and our mom’s friend. We got there early to tailgate, and over the course of about an hour and a half, my sister had 3 hard seltzers, and an entire bottle of wine.

The gates opened at 6PM. We were there over an hour early. Because it’s an outdoor venue and we had lawn seats, it’s first come, first serve to get a spot. Our friend knew someone working the event who hooked us up with chairs and great parking, so all we had to do was go grab our chairs and find a spot. But my mom “didn’t want to wait on line to get in” (we would’ve had to wait in lines anyway because there were 25,000 people attending - it was busy). So we got lawn seats so high up on a hill we couldn’t even see the stage. 

Then, my sister starts drinking even more. She had 3 more drinks before the show even started, and when she was so drunk she could barely keep her eyes open anymore, she went and got another one. I took that one from her when she wasn’t paying attention and she didn’t put up a fight. She was just being SO loud and obnoxious and RUDE, pointing at people, talking openly about them as if they couldn’t hear her. Kept trying to smoke cigarettes and weed in non-smoking areas. (I smoked a little both before and during the show, but I did so in the designated smoking areas.)

I’m just so tired of having my family spoil my fun when we go out. Hozier is one of my favorite artists and I missed the entire encore because my mom didn’t want to be there anymore. I spent half the night so focused on making sure my sister was okay that I barely got to enjoy the music. I’m so upset and annoyed and I told my mom in the car on the way home that this would be my last outing with them all, probably ever. 

Now, I feel like it’s worth saying that I had two drinks and smoked a little, I don’t like to get sloppy out in public due to bad past experiences when I was younger and also so I don’t embarrass myself. I’ve definitely gotten too hammered before but I was a lot younger and I’m actually scared to drink too much because alcoholism runs on both sides of my family. My mom is an alcoholic as well buy only had a couple drinks tonight.

117,1edyyy5,AITA for snapping at my mom? ,"Names are fake.

For context, my aunt is getting married very soon and my whole family of four (including me) is invited to the celebration.

My aunt (38F) asked me (16F) to work on a piece of work to add as decoration for her wedding, and I was honoured to be asked to help with it. My mom seemed kind of upset but she didn't really say anything much.

Just to give little more insight, my aunt (Tari) is actually my mom's friend from back when they were in middle school, but they aren't as close anymore. If anything, I'm closer to my aunt now. I think they aren't talking much anymore because of something their mutual friend did (I don't talk to this friend of theirs nor do I consider their friend my aunt), but they do still talk.

Anyway, I was working on the decoration sketch and showed my mom cause I wanted her opinion and she was telling me the stuff that looked funky, and I'm grateful for her feedback. I fixed the stuff she said looked bad but she still had issues, however she said it was okay after and just needed to add more to part of it.

However when I was basically finished with the draft, she came up and started telling me about all the stuff she said looked weird. She told me I could make it more realistic since I'm the one doing it and I thought she was sounding annoyed but I just said that I had a photo of how my aunt wanted it. I showed her the photo and she conceded but then she started telling me how the other stuff looked weird?? This was after I showed her the photo by the way.

She picked up the pencil and started darkening lines and rubbing off parts and I just got pretty annoyed and kinda snapped, I didn't yell or sound angry but you could probably tell I was annoyed. Cause she was making mentions of how she's does decor to and she could've done it so I just quipped back that my aunt asked ME to do it not her (I emphasized the 'ME' part when I was talking).

After that she just said how ""oh so I don't have the right to talk unless I have an artwork"" and I kinda just got downtrodden after hearing that cause she always makes herself the victim. I did clarify that I wasn't telling her that, I was just saying that Tari asked me to do it and she gave me a picture of what she wanted so I was following that.

She just walked away after and we're acting like usual but I'm still feeling annoyed about it. I do want to have a conversation with her but my mom would just tell my dad (38M) about it and he always takes her side. He'll probably say something like ""she just wants to help"" or ""you're being disrespectful"" and to be honest I don't wanna deal with that. Every time something like this happens he always ends up yelling and arguing with me, cuz we don't get along on a lot of things.

I became extremely depressed and I had enough of it, so I told her about the abuse that I went through because of my stepdad thinking that if not anything else, THAT would stopped her from ruining her life any longer. that it would stop her from destroying herself. this is ruining me and my brothers. but it seems that even though I told her about my abuse she is still using drugs, she is still probably seeing my stepdad.

Ive thought so hard about cutting her off like almost every person in my family, but I feel like If I give up, im giving up on my mother. will I be an evil person if I give up on her. ive tried everything

I miss my mother and I just want her back.",0.0,-0.01379361841827631,0,1
119,1edyx44,AITA for humiliating my sister at a family reunion?,"Every year, my(m21) family has a tradition where we do a talent show during reunions. My sister(f23), who loves writing poetry, decided to perform this year. She was excited and nervous, which I could see, and I know she put a lot of effort into her poem. I will say that the poem was a little bit on the cringe and emotional side, which is why I did what I did.

As my sister was reciting her poem, I thought it would be funny to stir the pot a bit. Right before she was about to finish, I started clapping loudly and making sarcastic comments, like, “Wow, Emily, that was... something,” and “I thought this was a poetry reading, not a therapy session!” I even joked that she should stick to writing in her diary.

I thought it was harmless fun and that everyone would see it as a joke. I didn’t expect the room to fall silent or for my sister to look so hurt. My uncle (dad's brother) laughed, and so did my 16 year old younger brother, but I could tell my sister was really upset. I didn’t back down or apologize because, honestly, I thought she needed to learn to laugh things off. I’ve always been the type to push boundaries, and I didn’t think this was a big deal.

After the talent show, my sister seemed really down, and the mood of the reunion was off for the rest of the day. My grandma tried to comfort her, but I could tell my sister was about to cry. Since then(the reunion was yesterday), my sister has not talked to me, and my parents are also really upset with me.

I’m now second-guessing whether I crossed a line. I thought I was just being funny and keeping the mood light, but it seems like I might have been an asshole. Was I wrong to do what I did? AITA?

121,1edye86,WIBTA if I move away from my elderly parents who need help,"I'm going to be using an alt account to stay anonymous. 

Some context and tl;dr: My partner and I (30s) live with my elderly parents (75+). In exchange for not paying rent we help take them to doctor's appointments, do household chores, and take them out anytime they want to go shopping. While we weren't ever asked to pay rent we still help pay for groceries, pay their phone bills (we put them under our plan), and pay for the internet. We aren't financially dependent on them but choose to stay since they need the help. My mother fell and has been struggling to recover leaving my partner and I to take over pretty much everything. I have three siblings (50s+) that ever since the fall have either refused to help or do just the bare minimum to save face. 

My dad, who I'll call John, gets confused. He's mostly independent but can't do complex things like bills, setting up his own medicine, or cook meals. He can't drive due to his confusion and prefers not to leave the house anyway. My mom, who I'll call Mary, handled everything up until the beginning of this year where she fell and broke a bone. This spurred up a whole other mess of medical issues that have only continued to pile on. She will eventually recover but still has a long road ahead of her. After the fall my partner and I have taken on a lot of my parent's responsibilities. We do everything for them at this point.

Both my partner and I work full time jobs. For over half a year our schedule has been something like this: Wake up a few hours before our normal wake up time for work to get John up and ready. Drop him off at the rehab facility to visit Mary while we work. Go to the rehab facility after work to visit and then take John home. Cook dinner, clean, and then getting an hour to ourselves before going to bed to repeat the next day.

The problem is my three siblings. They refuse to help out even and when they do it's the bare minimum. They rarely visited Mary while she was hospitalized or even after while she was in the rehab facility. One of them offered to take John on Saturdays so my partner and I could have a day to ourselves to relax but flake last minute most of the time. During the Holidays my siblings all got time off from work but still never offered to help. They went on vacations with their family while my partner and I had to continue doing everything.

I'm afraid that if my partner and I leave something bad will happen since I know my siblings won't suddenly start helping out. And even if they do, it will still just be the bare minimum. I don't think my parents can handle taking care of themselves at this point. If we bring up these issues to them they brush it off. They refuse to put their foot down and demand my siblings start helping out more. We feel like we're being used by everyone involved and don't know how much longer we can keep going like this.

I like to wear oversized t-shirts to sleep in. One of my best (guy) friends, James, offered me a few of his since he had lost weight recently and had no use for them anymore.



One night, his girlfriend, Emma (one of my other friends), came over to pick up something she had left at my house. It was late, and I was in my sleep attire, wearing one of the shirts James had gifted me. She was livid, cursing at me, yelling, and calling me a whore for sleeping with her boyfriend. I tried to explain, but she wasn't having it. She left after I told her that I would never sleep with her boyfriend.



When I got back inside, I texted James and told him what happened. A little backstory: James and I have been friends since high school, and he knows pretty much everything about me. We grew up in a small, religious town, and when I was 15, I figured out that I was a lesbian. James was the only one I told. He’s still one of the few who knows. While I believe my friend group wouldn't judge me, I'm scared and don’t like sharing it.



Back to the situation, James freaked out on the phone, worried Emma would break up with him. I told him to explain the story to her. Here's where things got messy. James told me to tell Emma that I was a lesbian so he ""didn't have to defend himself."" I said no because I wasn't comfortable sharing that information. He blew up, screaming about how Emma was going to leave him and how I was a terrible friend. I hung up and went to bed.



The next morning, my phone was flooded with messages from everyone I knew about how I was gay. I immediately called James, but when he picked up, I heard Emma’s voice. She was in tears, apologizing for cursing me out and hoping I would forgive her. Here's where I might be the asshole: I forgave her, but I also told her that I explicitly told James not to tell anyone and that he outed me to everyone, including my family.



Emma was shocked. She told me to hold on and called James into the room. She asked him if it was true, and he said yes. She broke up with him on the spot, calling him a narcissistic asshole, and then hung up with me. James called me multiple times after, but I blocked him. Our friends now know what happened, thanks to Emma, but most of them are on James's side.

One of my cousins (who passed in 2013 due to an attempted robbery) robbed us before, and 80% of the family is essentially hoodlums.

I, along with my dad's wife and my little sister, have told him to stop telling everyone about his situation.

127,1edxjti,AITA for telling my dad no? ,"I (21F) am living with my dad (50M) and younger brother (20M) while finishing school. I recently started a new job as an educational assistant at a school 30 minutes away from home. Before this, I worked two part-time jobs, often totaling up to 15 hours a day, in addition to attending school and managing household chores. I love walking my dogs, but they are highly dog-aggressive, so I usually take them out at night to avoid other dogs.

My dad found a park that my dogs enjoy, which requires a 10-minute walk through a mesa. I don’t mind helping him with this, but he tends to stay there for at least an hour to let the dogs run. One night, after a particularly long shift at both of my jobs, I nearly tripped on a rock, and when my dad asked if I was okay, I mentioned I was exhausted from working all day. He dismissed my feelings, saying, “You don’t know exhaustion; you’re only 20.” I let it go and continued with the walk.

Later, as we were walking, he complained that if I weren’t so lazy, we would’ve left for the park around 9:30 PM as he had planned. I reminded him that I had worked nearly 16 hours that day and needed sleep to avoid missing my early morning alarm. He insisted I didn’t understand true exhaustion. Despite my attempts to stay calm, it was getting late—almost 10:30 PM—so I told him he needed to respect my schedule. I gave him the option to either come with me or stay out as long as he wanted while I took my dog home. He grudgingly agreed to come with me.

Since then, whenever he asks where I want to go, he expects me to choose the new park, which usually involves staying out later than I’m comfortable with.

AITA for setting boundaries and prioritizing my own schedule and rest over my dad’s preference for park visits?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-28,"AITA for telling my dad no?  I (21F) am living with my dad (50M) and younger brother (20M) while finishing school. I recently started a new job as an educational assistant at a school 30 minutes away from home. Before this, I worked two part-time jobs, often totaling up to 15 hours a day, in addition to attending school and managing household chores. I love walking my dogs, but they are highly dog-aggressive, so I usually take them out at night to avoid other dogs.

My dad found a park that my dogs enjoy, which requires a 10-minute walk through a mesa. I don’t mind helping him with this, but he tends to stay there for at least an hour to let the dogs run. One night, after a particularly long shift at both of my jobs, I nearly tripped on a rock, and when my dad asked if I was okay, I mentioned I was exhausted from working all day. He dismissed my feelings, saying, “You don’t know exhaustion; you’re only 20.” I let it go and continued with the walk.

Later, as we were walking, he complained that if I weren’t so lazy, we would’ve left for the park around 9:30 PM as he had planned. I reminded him that I had worked nearly 16 hours that day and needed sleep to avoid missing my early morning alarm. He insisted I didn’t understand true exhaustion. Despite my attempts to stay calm, it was getting late—almost 10:30 PM—so I told him he needed to respect my schedule. I gave him the option to either come with me or stay out as long as he wanted while I took my dog home. He grudgingly agreed to come with me.

Since then, whenever he asks where I want to go, he expects me to choose the new park, which usually involves staying out later than I’m comfortable with.

128,1edxeib,AITA if I don’t like that My (33F) boyfriend (36M) wants me to run more and cut out the little time to myself that makes me happy,"So the title isn’t complete so I’ll explain it here.

We have been having fights almost daily. I honestly don’t know why we are still together but if I try and leave he doesn’t let me but he constantly tells me he loves me and wants to make it work but doesn’t know why he is with me anymore bc it hurts him so much.

So the extended title story is this. I have been trying to workout to be in shape so we can go on a vacation where he “doesn’t have to leave me behind bc I can’t do the exercise.” He wants to hike up half dome. I am skeptical bc I don’t even like heights but he wants to do it so I want to try for him. Mind you, I road bike regularly, I just don’t enjoy running. I’m not in perfect shape but I’m not out of shape either.

The problem is since we have hours long fights that keeps us up until 3am, I can’t run before work. I’m already having a nap when I get home before my 2 hour class 4 days a week that is from 6:30-8:30 to learn his native language. Then, I have to make us dinner. Then we have to have a talk about our relationship, have a book club, I practice a therapy skill, I clean the house. The earliest it’s seems I can get to bed is 11pm. If things go poorly, which they have been for a few weeks now, we stay up arguing until 2-3am. So my runs got cut out. I’ve told him repeatedly that if I don’t go to bed before 11pm I don’t have time to run. He told me to move my run time. I asked him what he is willing to cut out bc there just isn’t enough time to do it all. He told me any free time I have (ie my nap before class) I can cut out. Mind you, I’m napping bc I got 4 hours of sleep the night before for multiple nights in a row. I have to work M-F. He seriously works 2 days a week and doesn’t wake up until after noon. On the weekends I have to wake up earlier than him to make us breakfast.

Today he told me he wants me to cut out my naps or playing video games before work and I said that isn’t fair. I need to have some me time where I have fun and he asked is that what you are going to say when you are pregnant. You deserve fun time? Granted I didn’t handle that well and said f%^* you and left the room.

My birthday is tomorrow so the kids are staying with us a day early (shared custody). I wanted Sunday to be a chill day without them & frankly a day off for me not having to be momager. I come from a very organized on time upbringing. My partner & the kids are the opposite & it absolutely kills me. They take forever to get ready & move slower than watching paint dry on top of constantly being distracted by seemingly nothing. My partner & the teen girl are the worst. I could go on for a lifetime about the struggle of getting them up & moving, & remembering everything but I’m beyond exhausted. 

Anyways, a month ago I asked for my birthday weekend to be on “me time”. Meaning everybody up, moving, & on their p’s & q’s with little to no complaining. So far it’s been mostly a fail. We are late yet again & I feel defeated. This morning in bed we went through today’s game plan. He agreed to it all & I thought he was paying attention but I guess not.

Boys get ready in the time I’m out. Kids pack their bags & put them in dads car. Everyone be 100% ready to go by time I’m back at 1:00 so we can leave to go to the Ohio State Fair.

I'm 17, my sister is 18. My sister and i have always sat in the same seats in the car, no matter whose car it's been. It's been this way since we were very small, as kids she sat in my booster seat a couple times because she had a carseat at the time, and i think she wanted to try it out or something. My sister tries to copy me in many cases if that makes sense ((i used a really rough word here, but i don't mind it at all)), i'm younger, but she has Down's, & i've always been more of an older sibling figure.

Additionally, i am very particular about many of these sorts of things — i had a meltdown about my parents moving the cutlery to a different drawer as a kid as an example, my sister can be the same way as well.

Us & our mom got a ride from our uncle to our family friends' house today. I took a little extra time cos i couldn't find my pencils & forgot to lock the door. When i got to the car, my sister was sitting in my seat, i got mad at her from that. My mom & uncle thought my reaction was very unnecessary, i'm annoyingly gullible so i was somewhat swayed there, but now i'm not sure.

AITA here?

((I haven't posted here yet, so please lmk if i've done anything wrong here – i did look over the rules but i may have forgotten/misread something))

I'm 17, my sister is 18. My sister and i have always sat in the same seats in the car, no matter whose car it's been. It's been this way since we were very small, as kids she sat in my booster seat a couple times because she had a carseat at the time, and i think she wanted to try it out or something. My sister tries to copy me in many cases if that makes sense ((i used a really rough word here, but i don't mind it at all)), i'm younger, but she has Down's, & i've always been more of an older sibling figure.

Additionally, i am very particular about many of these sorts of things — i had a meltdown about my parents moving the cutlery to a different drawer as a kid as an example, my sister can be the same way as well.

Us & our mom got a ride from our uncle to our family friends' house today. I took a little extra time cos i couldn't find my pencils & forgot to lock the door. When i got to the car, my sister was sitting in my seat, i got mad at her from that. My mom & uncle thought my reaction was very unnecessary, i'm annoyingly gullible so i was somewhat swayed there, but now i'm not sure.

AITA here?

He is livid & says I'm inconsiderate. I said he hasn't gotten gas for me for the past 20 years when we use my car all the time  so why do I have to get gas for him when he is on empty?  

Btw its not on empty its about 1/8th of tank. No orange light/dinging for low gas warning. 

He says I just gave you $1300. Hmm, I thought that was to help pay for my  repair but now he wants to hold it over my head. I offered him $20 and he said its not about the money.

I currently live in a 2B apartment that my parents bought in the city I go to school in, and to help with rent, I rented the spare bedroom to my current roommate, let’s call her Debbie. She’s been rooming with me for about two years now. I also like to cook whenever I can, which means I use the kitchen more than she does. 

Last year, she was a perfectly fine roommate, but something changed this year and she’s gotten a little obsessive over how things are. To start off, she’s on a bunch of meds for mental illnesses (anxiety, depression) and is a VERY clean person. I would call myself a rather clean person too. Recently, she’s been nit-picking over how clean we keep our common-living areas (kitchen, living area). Our microwave is made out of black glass (i think?) and our fridge is stainless steel. So, if you do touch either, fingerprints are left behind. Ever since a couple weeks, she’s been complaining about the fingerprints I leave behind. I usually clean everything at the end of the day but don’t have time to clean every time I touch an appliance. Couple of days ago, she sent me a text saying how I’m acting like a grimy child leaving their nasty fingerprints everywhere, and that she’s tired of cleaning them after me. I apologized and said I usually clean it at the end of the day. Then this morning, I was eating breakfast and she comes to the kitchen and says “holy *** why are you letting the kitchen get this dirty” after I had JUST made breakfast and hadn’t cleaned up yet. Our kitchen is clean, except for her issue with fingerprints. I blew up on her and said if she has an issue about being a control-freak over every little thing (fingerprints are not the only thing she complains about), she can move out. She started tearing up and I left to go to school. Was I an AH? 

Fyi she has also complained in the past about the light switches not being put in the same direction, me not washing my airfryer after everytime i use it (even though it’s mine and she doesn’t use it at  all), etc.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-28,"AITA for blowing up on my roommate for her obsessiveness?

144,1edv7lm,AITA for not getting dog food?,"This is between my mom, (57f) and I (23f). I was housesitting for a week for some family (unpaid), and I’m currently a college student looking for a job. The store we get our dog food from is up near my cousin’s house, and they close at 9pm. It’s about 10 miles from my house, 25 minutes away.

My cousins were due back last night around midnight, so around 5pm, I started to tidy the house before doing some homework, a quiz, and an exam (also due at midnight).

I needed to wash and fold the towels/blankets I’d used, make a loaf of banana bread, wash the dog (needs baths bc of a skin condition), pack my clothes, and just generally return the house to its original state.

My mom had been up there earlier in the afternoon to swim in their pool. Around 6:30, an hour after she got home, she texted me asking me to run to the store nearby to get some dog food for our dogs, because she’d forgotten. I told her I’d be busy since I was cleaning, and needed to do homework, so I couldn’t.

I finished everything and got home around 11:30pm last night. Today, she spends all day in that same city where the store is, but forgets to go again. Just now around 5pm, she told me I needed to go to get dog food. She just poured us out some margaritas, so I suggested some alternatives:
- use things we have here to make them food food for a day or two until I can go tomorrow
- run to the grocery store nearby to pick up a small bag until I can go to the correct store

She says no, she doesn’t want them “eating that crap from the store” and tells me to go now. I push back a bit because I’ve driven 160 miles this week to school and back, and gas is expensive right now. I also need new tires, have a phone bill coming in, and need to buy a bridesmaid dress for a wedding in 8 weeks. All while being unemployed, and my savings is running out.

She then tells me she pays for everything and to stop being a child. I’m wondering if I’m the AH? She was up near the store twice and could’ve gotten a bag of food but forgot. It’s not the price of the food ($13), but the fact that it would take almost an hour to go there and back. I buy all our dog’s food, with one exception earlier this year when I wasn’t home for a month.

I’m upset because 1, she could’ve asked me earlier in the day, or 2, gotten it herself while she was up there. I definitely take responsibility for forgetting about it this morning, but she was right next to the store all day and also forgot, but she’s mad at me.

Edit: I pay for my own car bill, gas, phone, clothes, school supplies, dog food, and a lot of the groceries. I often shop the clearance racks at the grocery store to get deals since I’ve been unemployed for a bit now. I quit my last job because the boss was making me uncomfortable at work (I was the only woman in the office), and have been actively applying for other jobs. Before I was a student, I paid a small amount of rent, but she has always helped me out with car insurance. ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-28,"AITA for not getting dog food?
