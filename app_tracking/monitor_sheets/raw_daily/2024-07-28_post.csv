0,1edutc2,AITA for telling my colleagues to “stop talking about me” and “worry about their own boring lives”,"I (23F) work in a school, and recently I was told by a close colleague that there is a rumour being spread around staff that I am having an affair with a male teacher, let’s call him Jim (30-35yrs).

Apparently the rumours started when we went out as a group for ‘end of year’ drinks a few months ago, and we (myself and Jim) had one conversation, which I don’t even remember the topic of. And a group of women I work with, who are known to be the gossips of the school, saw this and created this rumour. I know it’s them because they make it a point to ask me about Jim at random times and walk away laughing when I don’t give a response or tell them to stop as it makes me uncomfortable. 

This has escalated to rumours about us kissing, myself and his wife having arguments (even though I’ve never met her) and the most recent one is a few weeks ago people at work went out for drinks again and I didn’t attend, and apparently neither did Jim, which made people jump to the conclusion that we were sleeping together. Of course, this spread like wildfire.

Keep in mind Jim is married with a new born child, and I have no romantic interest, we only ever talk at work and when we do it’s about work.

However next year the Principle has decided to mix up which class staff teach in, and I have been put in Jim’s class, which I have no issue with as we get on well at work, but when this was announced the group of women found me after work and started to make ‘jokey’ remarks about how ‘happy’ I must be, and how I can ‘enjoy some alone time’ with Jim. I was just so sick of being made fun of and spoken about so I said (kind of shouted) to them “will you just shut up, stop talking about me and worry about your own boring lives”. I don’t usually stoop down to people when they’re being mean but I’d had enough. 

2 out of the 3 women started to cry and say how my comments were undeserved and rude and they were only making jokes. They walked away and I got called into the deputy principal’s office the next day as they had reported me. I made her aware of all the things going on and how I had asked them to stop repeatedly, but she just said that I need to understand that it’s all jokes and to not let it get to me and that I shouldn’t have shouted at them. Don’t get me wrong, I can take a joke, but when it turns into making out that I’m a homewrecker, that’s crossed the line in my opinion.

1,1edut5x,AITA for being rude  to  and ignoring my boyfriend's friends?,"



Me (20M) and my boyfriend Lysander (19M) live together and so we both end up spending alot of time with eachothers friends. Thing is Lysander was a sporty Jock kid in school and most of his friends are straight sporty guys and we live in Tennessee. Not that I'm really fem or anything, not that there's anything wrong with that  its just that I'm an average nerdy  guy who was never that into sports and with slightly gayer friends. So  to his friends that means I'm ""the girl"" in our relationship.

They constantly joke about him needing to ask his ""old lady"" for permission to go out drinking or have a boys night  or referring to me and his wife. Or stuff like asking him if he gave his ""lil lady"" some money to get her nails done because sometimes I paint my nails. Lysander digs in on it and makes jokes with him even after I've told him  privately that it bothers me. I end up juts rolling with it to keep the peace with his friends.

I talked to my brother's (23 and 19) and my friends about it and they said I should just straight up ignore his friends whenever they start up and to just pretend they aren't there. So I tried that over the last week and today Lysander confronted me about and he told me his friends thought I was being rude to them by ignoring them and not engaging with them when they come over. I told him that I don't want to talk to people who constantly make fun of me and he gets upset saying that's just them joking around and that's how it's been his whole life. He tells me maybe if I tried to get along with them better and just indulged them I wouldn't be so offended.

2,1edupiv,AITA for screaming at my father for blocking me from contacting my siblings?,"I, (F15) screamed at my father over the phone and it was for a reason. He has blocked me now. He does not live with me, I didn’t even know he existed until I was around 8 years old. I live with my step dad and mum and 4 of my siblings who are related to my step dad and my mum. Around 13, I realised how much of a lousy father my dad really is. He hardly texts/texted me, never tried to see me or be involved with my life etc. I have explained how frustrated and unfair he is to me a few times and last year I had blocked him for the first time and what i thought would be the last. This year I finally got to have full contact with my brother and sister who are also related to my father who live in London. My dad lives in Spain (he moved a few years back) by the way. I live a little far away from london but it’s not too far train ride. Me and my sister planned for me to go on a train to see them both as we hadn’t been able to see/talk to each other in about a year and a half. So this happened, I saw them, and a day later my father yelled and yelled at my brother and sister. This was for not telling him I had come to the see them. I’m assuming he is mad because he’s jealous possibly? He had blocked my sisters apps on her phone so she could not use them for a few days. He can only do this because he had put parental controls on her phone and not told my siblings mother the password. My sister came round my house a week later and i did not know about my dad knowing about me seeing them last week. So my sister told me about what happened, and I lost it. I unblocked my dad and texted him about how angry I am that he took this out on my siblings. Punishing them for no reason. He told me I was lying about this? I knew I wasn’t as my sister and her mother told me! I blocked him after again because I was sick of him just blatantly lying and not even apologising. After my sister went home the next day, my dad had once again blocked my sister apps, including Whatsapp which is the app she is able to contact me on. So she could not contact me and my dad knew this. I was fuming. I called him and screamed at him for blocking contact from my sister and called him selfish. All he said was “wow” and then hung up on me. And then I was blocked. I cried my eyes out, I couldn’t believe he blocked his daughter. I promised myself I’d never call him an asshole or anything mean in a sense because I’m sort of scared he might un alive himself or something if I do. All i called him was selfish and a liar. Which are both true. I don’t know or not if i was an asshole for doing this. I don’t even know if he’ll ever unblock me again.

I can't afford to fly out now as I'm still tryinf to recover financially from the funeral. Even if I decide to split the payments up it would make me more financially vulnerable when I'm trying to save money. I loved my grandma a lot and I was very close to her but my father is upset and possibly even angry with me. I explained why I could not go but he is still upset and I understand. I feel guilt becuase I could have planned this better and spent less when I first moved here. Should I try to finance the flight? Am I in the wrong?

4,1edujq8,AITA for trying to dissuade my mom from a scam,"Hi internet 
I will just keep it as short as possible. My mom and I are very close, we've gone through a lot together over the years.

Sadly, I lost my father recently and it was hard and my mom found someone on the internet she has an interest in.

I'm happy for her and wish to see her smiling and laughing but the guy she's communicating with is giving me red flags 🚩 

Like a ton of pig butchering flags 
(Love bombing, supposedly successful, shows/talks crypto in the first month, calls day and night nonstop, promises for a happy future, etc etc) 

At first I tried to give subtle hints that this could be a scam but since nothing bad happened, and as long as she was happy, I was alright with just being on the sidelines watching. That is until recently when he started to ask for money to ""teach"" her how to invest without meeting her yet (he cancelled the meeting) 

That was the one red flag I felt I had to step in and tell her ""hey this is a possible scam don't do it"" because it isn't a small chump of change either
 
I tried to show her proof (ex: invalid phone number, incorrect address, no proof of the account linking to them personally, no one named that in the US that matches his info) but she kept denying it and instead criticized me and said I was trying to control her, mold her into someone I want, doesn't understand the business world, a fool that doesn't know anything.

 It hurt, it hurt a lot and even after communicating with the guy and him giving 0 proof on speaker with her right there, she wouldn't budge.
I tried to communicate how she hurt my feelings and also to not give anymore money (if she really was going to go through with this-and she did) until she met the guy.

She rejected my feelings and said I had no reason to be upset since it didn't involve me.

It hasn't been a week and I try not to communicate with her too much when we see each other because I'm still very bitter about what she said to me  
AITA: for trying to get involved because I felt this was a scam that could harm her and giving her the cold shoulder after what she said to me 

UPDATE: I know no one probably asked but I tried to mend our relationship and ended up prostrating myself and begging for forgiveness for being the greatest mistake and failure of her life 
She has also deemed to trust this man more than me and ---I just feel like I must give up on any hope at this point",Not the A-hole,2024-07-28,"AITA for trying to dissuade my mom from a scam Hi internet
