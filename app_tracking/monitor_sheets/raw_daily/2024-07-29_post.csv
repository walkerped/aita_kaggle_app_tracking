0,1ef4x51,AITA for inviting my trans Girlfriend to help my sister set up for her craft expo that my sister asked me to bring her to,"My sister (15F) asked me to bring my gf to her Crochet market, and when I (19M) asked my mother (40F) she said I could, I had been working most of the week and when I got home around 10 pm while on the phone with my girlfriend (22F) my sister came in my room and asked me what time she was going to be there, I told her she’d be there at 8 am, my sister told me she needed to be that at 7 am to help set up, I relayed the information and thought nothing of it.

My mother had expressed being hesitant to have my gf around my sisters especially the youngest (9F) without telling her what she can and cannot say about her identity and without going by her dead name. My gf was fine with that (we both hold a bit of animosity because of it due to us being trans) this conversation has still yet to take place 

So the next morning my sister and I were talking about my girlfriend being there, and my mom was furious and said I was overstepping boundaries and said she didn’t even think I’d be there for that long (The show was from 8:30-12:30 and I had to work at 2) I told her I wanted to be there the whole day to be there for my sister and my sister had invited my Girlfriend. My mother said it wasn’t about my sister and didn’t matter what she wants because she’s a minor. Meanwhile my girlfriend has been up since 6 am and is driving to the venue because she lives 45 minutes away from it, and as she arrives my mother pulls me into her bedroom along with my father and she began crying and saying she doesn’t want that around her kids and doesn’t want me talking about “Getting my boobs chopped off,” or “How he’s going to be a ‘mom’” which I have never discussed with my sisters. She also knows I had a miscarriage a few months primo and has said in the past my girlfriend and I would be terrible parents due to our transness. I ended up saying I don’t care how she feels and we just won’t go, and my dad told me how I would be getting to work (I take my moms car) and I snarky said I will walk and stormed out, I had been mentally unwell for a few weeks at this point so after they left I called my partner and she came and collected me so I wouldn’t hurt myself while alone, I ended up sleeping at her apartment while she played with my hair and made sure I was okay, I got a text from my mother a few hours before the event ended and told me that her and I could still come and support my sister. So my girlfriend and I came and she bought some of my sisters stock, and my parents acted completely unlike themselves the whole time. My girlfriends said once we’d gotten in the car that she believed they were faking their demeanor which I agree with. My mother also said I was a terrible employee for pulling out of my shift at work that day, and told me my depression was my own fault because I didn’t know my psychiatrist does walk ins. I believe I’m not but I also don’t have children of my own, so am I the asshole?",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-07-29,"AITA for inviting my trans Girlfriend to help my sister set up for her craft expo that my sister asked me to bring her to My sister (15F) asked me to bring my gf to her Crochet market, and when I (19M) asked my mother (40F) she said I could, I had been working most of the week and when I got home around 10 pm while on the phone with my girlfriend (22F) my sister came in my room and asked me what time she was going to be there, I told her she’d be there at 8 am, my sister told me she needed to be that at 7 am to help set up, I relayed the information and thought nothing of it.

1,1eem37g,AITA for wanting to cut contact with my brother?,"i know this is long but please, i need unbiased minds to tell me if i’m TA. for context i (f26) am 12 years younger than my sister (f38) and 11 years younger than my brother (m37). by the time i was 8, they had both moved away from home and i was pretty much an only child. my sister was my best friend up until she cut contact with our family when i was 16. my brother and i have never been close for whatever reason. i don’t know if that was because of the age gap or what, but we’ve never been close. growing up, he acted like a second father telling me what to do and how to act, getting me in trouble for anything and everything, you name it. he tried acting like my parent and my dad was already strict enough and a hard enough father, i didn’t need 2, especially a copy and paste. i’ve gone a few times no contact with my parents, but i love my mom and i don’t like life without her so i go back.

now to the juicy stuff (even tho it’s not that juicy lol). my brother and i have often gone months without speaking. i don’t speak to his wife much either. it became a normal thing to me. my parents eventually moved across the country when my dad retired. then they eventually decided to move 10 hours from me to be closer to my brother and his wife and their kids. i got a 2 month notice they were moving when they had known for 6 months. it really messed me up and i still have problems letting it go. i haven’t spent a single holiday with them since 2021, and that holiday my SIL tried kicking me out of the house for i don’t even remember why, a bullshit reason. for the last 3-4 years, i have always had to be the one to initiate contact. i’ve had to do the reaching out or my brother and SIL did not reach out. my brother would respond and if there was nothing else to say in the conversation, i’d simply not reply because there was no response needed. they never sent me pictures of my nephews, even though i asked. i have not gotten a happy birthday, merry Christmas, happy thanksgiving from either of them since 2022. up until friday, i had not heard from them since july of 2023. my dad almost died earlier this year and was in the hospital for almost 4 months. my brother lived 30 minutes from the hospital that my dad was at and it took him almost 2 weeks before he went to go visit and support my mom as she was pretty much watching my dad die all by herself. i lived in a different state and couldn’t take that much time off as we were all gearing up for a funeral. fortunately, my dad miraculously recovered and is doing great now. anyways, during that time i sent my brother a text saying he needed to step up and be there for my mom as she was all along and he couldn’t even be bothered to take an hour out of his day to be with her and all i got was a thumbs up back. that was february. fast forward to a week or so ago, i shared a facebook post basically saying i wasn’t afraid to cut people off, even if you’re blood and i captioned it “ask my ex sister, ex brother, ex aunt and ex uncle. blood doesn’t make you family. that’s built off trust and loyalty”. somehow, my brother saw this post. mind you, i have pretty much my entire family blocked or they have me blocked and my brother has 0 social media. so my brother texts me on friday (i’ll insert convo below). and then texts me on saturday a youtube video of jigsaw saying “wanna play a game” and then sends me taylor swifts song antihero today. and to top it off, i got into it with my mom about this because she thinks i should forgive and forget. we also got into it about how they don’t come see me for holidays because they don’t want to miss their grandchildrens holidays.  i don’t get christmas presents or birthday presents anymore because they’re “focusing that on the grandkids”, even though i am single with no kids. and my mom told me she would come visit more if i had grandkids for her to see. and i asked her “so i’m only worthy to you if i have kids?” and she said “no that’s not at all what i’m saying” but that’s basically what she was saying or am i crazy?? i think it’s crazy that now that i’ve posted it publicly, he wants to apologize and do the most and be extra because why?? you want me to take my post down bc i told all of facebook i don’t claim you anymore? because the second i stopped doing the reaching out first, i stopped getting any sort of communication from him or my SIL. so, AITA for wanting to completely cut contact? am i valid in how i’m feeling and for wanting to do it??

brother: “when are you going to tell your big brother the big news?!”

me: “?”

brother: “i made the list with your ex sister and ex aunt and uncle. i feel honored, thank you…. i’m not sure what i did(or didn’t do) to deserve this honor but thanks for the honor😉🤗”

me: “that’s a choice you made just as much as i did. congratulations i guess.”

brother: “Why, thank you. Though I would counter/argue that only you have made that choice. I don’t claim you as an “ex sister”. I’m not sure I’ve ever said or posted that you were an ex sister. If you wouldn’t mind sharing how I made that choice, I would love to know but understand if you don’t want to share.”

me: “oh i guess i’ve been the only one not putting effort into our relationship. crazy, i must be missing all the effort you’ve been putting into it. sorry, must be all on me for that.”

brother: “Ah, I see. Well I do apologize if you feel I haven’t been putting forth the effort you have felt needed for our relationship. I’m certainly not perfect but I will certainly try to do a better job. With your last number I was the last one to respond and with this new number was also the last one to reply before you scolded me (without asking or knowing what’s going on but I’m not upset about it) about dads situation. What is it you need from me to help/better our relationship? I can’t promise I will text every day but you’re still my sister regardless. We won’t see eye to eye on everything but that doesn’t change the fact that you are still my sister. So I apologize for my end of things and for not putting in the effort that you needed and wanted from me.”

2,1eelwci,AITA for closing on time when I knew a customer was wanting to trade in,"So for some background. I work for an arcade in a hotel. People can play the machines, win tickets and then trade them for fabulous prizes(Or at least fabulous by Poundland standards.)

The arcade ticket booth is open from 9AM till 10PM. That's when we are paid up to. Not 10:30 or anythin. Closes at 10PM, and we go home. Usually there is only one attendant in the arcade. 

One night at 9:56PM a guy was walking past. He'd maybe been in the club with his kids, watching the entertainment. He asked, ""Is that you finished now?""

I replied, ""Almost.""

""Alright, we'll be back shortly with tickets."" and he disappeared. 

I continued cleaning the machine I was cleaning, Then looked at my phone, 22:01. Time to go. I lowered the curtain in the ticket booth and left. 

I was in the next morning. He asked why I hadn't stayed. I told him I was finished work at 10PM. He said that he was hoping to leave early in the morning but had to stay untill 9 to trade in his tickets for my junk. I refused to apologise.

  
""Shortly with ticktes""

Define ""shortly,"" it was clearly more than 4 minutes for him. Would he have been there at 10:02PM? OR would there have happened to be, say, family guy on TV and he wanted to stop to watch that then come back half an hour later.

Define ""With tickets."" He could have them all neat, a few receipts with the values. They've decided ahead of time what they want and take no time. OR They could have countless little recepts, Crumpled up in different pockets, as I'm adding them up they are throwing more crumpled receipts on my desk, the first kid takes ages deciding, when they finally do the second kid who hasn't even started looking yet starts to decide, after taking an age they choose something, the one thing that the first kid didn't notice and the first kid is now trying to decide what they should put back to get it, as they are doing that the second kid changes their mind on what they want... and so on. Might be that they haven't even shredded all their tickets yet and still need to. 

I didn't want to hang about to find out which scenario(or any possibility between) it would be.
