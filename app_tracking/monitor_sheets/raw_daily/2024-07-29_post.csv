0,1ef4x51,AITA for inviting my trans Girlfriend to help my sister set up for her craft expo that my sister asked me to bring her to,"My sister (15F) asked me to bring my gf to her Crochet market, and when I (19M) asked my mother (40F) she said I could, I had been working most of the week and when I got home around 10 pm while on the phone with my girlfriend (22F) my sister came in my room and asked me what time she was going to be there, I told her she’d be there at 8 am, my sister told me she needed to be that at 7 am to help set up, I relayed the information and thought nothing of it.

My mother had expressed being hesitant to have my gf around my sisters especially the youngest (9F) without telling her what she can and cannot say about her identity and without going by her dead name. My gf was fine with that (we both hold a bit of animosity because of it due to us being trans) this conversation has still yet to take place 

So the next morning my sister and I were talking about my girlfriend being there, and my mom was furious and said I was overstepping boundaries and said she didn’t even think I’d be there for that long (The show was from 8:30-12:30 and I had to work at 2) I told her I wanted to be there the whole day to be there for my sister and my sister had invited my Girlfriend. My mother said it wasn’t about my sister and didn’t matter what she wants because she’s a minor. Meanwhile my girlfriend has been up since 6 am and is driving to the venue because she lives 45 minutes away from it, and as she arrives my mother pulls me into her bedroom along with my father and she began crying and saying she doesn’t want that around her kids and doesn’t want me talking about “Getting my boobs chopped off,” or “How he’s going to be a ‘mom’” which I have never discussed with my sisters. She also knows I had a miscarriage a few months primo and has said in the past my girlfriend and I would be terrible parents due to our transness. I ended up saying I don’t care how she feels and we just won’t go, and my dad told me how I would be getting to work (I take my moms car) and I snarky said I will walk and stormed out, I had been mentally unwell for a few weeks at this point so after they left I called my partner and she came and collected me so I wouldn’t hurt myself while alone, I ended up sleeping at her apartment while she played with my hair and made sure I was okay, I got a text from my mother a few hours before the event ended and told me that her and I could still come and support my sister. So my girlfriend and I came and she bought some of my sisters stock, and my parents acted completely unlike themselves the whole time. My girlfriends said once we’d gotten in the car that she believed they were faking their demeanor which I agree with. My mother also said I was a terrible employee for pulling out of my shift at work that day, and told me my depression was my own fault because I didn’t know my psychiatrist does walk ins.

1,1eem37g,AITA for wanting to cut contact with my brother?,"i know this is long but please, i need unbiased minds to tell me if i’m TA. for context i (f26) am 12 years younger than my sister (f38) and 11 years younger than my brother (m37). by the time i was 8, they had both moved away from home and i was pretty much an only child. my sister was my best friend up until she cut contact with our family when i was 16. my brother and i have never been close for whatever reason. i don’t know if that was because of the age gap or what, but we’ve never been close. growing up, he acted like a second father telling me what to do and how to act, getting me in trouble for anything and everything, you name it. he tried acting like my parent and my dad was already strict enough and a hard enough father, i didn’t need 2, especially a copy and paste. i’ve gone a few times no contact with my parents, but i love my mom and i don’t like life without her so i go back.

now to the juicy stuff (even tho it’s not that juicy lol). my brother and i have often gone months without speaking. i don’t speak to his wife much either. it became a normal thing to me. my parents eventually moved across the country when my dad retired. then they eventually decided to move 10 hours from me to be closer to my brother and his wife and their kids. i got a 2 month notice they were moving when they had known for 6 months. it really messed me up and i still have problems letting it go. i haven’t spent a single holiday with them since 2021, and that holiday my SIL tried kicking me out of the house for i don’t even remember why, a bullshit reason. for the last 3-4 years, i have always had to be the one to initiate contact. i’ve had to do the reaching out or my brother and SIL did not reach out. my brother would respond and if there was nothing else to say in the conversation, i’d simply not reply because there was no response needed. they never sent me pictures of my nephews, even though i asked. i have not gotten a happy birthday, merry Christmas, happy thanksgiving from either of them since 2022. up until friday, i had not heard from them since july of 2023. my dad almost died earlier this year and was in the hospital for almost 4 months. my brother lived 30 minutes from the hospital that my dad was at and it took him almost 2 weeks before he went to go visit and support my mom as she was pretty much watching my dad die all by herself. i lived in a different state and couldn’t take that much time off as we were all gearing up for a funeral. fortunately, my dad miraculously recovered and is doing great now. anyways, during that time i sent my brother a text saying he needed to step up and be there for my mom as she was all along and he couldn’t even be bothered to take an hour out of his day to be with her and all i got was a thumbs up back. that was february. fast forward to a week or so ago, i shared a facebook post basically saying i wasn’t afraid to cut people off, even if you’re blood and i captioned it “ask my ex sister, ex brother, ex aunt and ex uncle. blood doesn’t make you family. that’s built off trust and loyalty”. somehow, my brother saw this post. mind you, i have pretty much my entire family blocked or they have me blocked and my brother has 0 social media. so my brother texts me on friday (i’ll insert convo below). and then texts me on saturday a youtube video of jigsaw saying “wanna play a game” and then sends me taylor swifts song antihero today. and to top it off, i got into it with my mom about this because she thinks i should forgive and forget. we also got into it about how they don’t come see me for holidays because they don’t want to miss their grandchildrens holidays.  i don’t get christmas presents or birthday presents anymore because they’re “focusing that on the grandkids”, even though i am single with no kids. and my mom told me she would come visit more if i had grandkids for her to see. and i asked her “so i’m only worthy to you if i have kids?” and she said “no that’s not at all what i’m saying” but that’s basically what she was saying or am i crazy?? i think it’s crazy that now that i’ve posted it publicly, he wants to apologize and do the most and be extra because why?? you want me to take my post down bc i told all of facebook i don’t claim you anymore? because the second i stopped doing the reaching out first, i stopped getting any sort of communication from him or my SIL. so, AITA for wanting to completely cut contact? am i valid in how i’m feeling and for wanting to do it??

brother: “when are you going to tell your big brother the big news?!”

me: “?”

brother: “i made the list with your ex sister and ex aunt and uncle. i feel honored, thank you…. i’m not sure what i did(or didn’t do) to deserve this honor but thanks for the honor😉🤗”

me: “that’s a choice you made just as much as i did. congratulations i guess.”

brother: “Why, thank you. Though I would counter/argue that only you have made that choice. I don’t claim you as an “ex sister”. I’m not sure I’ve ever said or posted that you were an ex sister. If you wouldn’t mind sharing how I made that choice, I would love to know but understand if you don’t want to share.”

me: “oh i guess i’ve been the only one not putting effort into our relationship. crazy, i must be missing all the effort you’ve been putting into it. sorry, must be all on me for that.”

brother: “Ah, I see. Well I do apologize if you feel I haven’t been putting forth the effort you have felt needed for our relationship. I’m certainly not perfect but I will certainly try to do a better job. With your last number I was the last one to respond and with this new number was also the last one to reply before you scolded me (without asking or knowing what’s going on but I’m not upset about it) about dads situation. What is it you need from me to help/better our relationship? I can’t promise I will text every day but you’re still my sister regardless. We won’t see eye to eye on everything but that doesn’t change the fact that you are still my sister.

2,1eelwci,AITA for closing on time when I knew a customer was wanting to trade in,"So for some background. I work for an arcade in a hotel. People can play the machines, win tickets and then trade them for fabulous prizes(Or at least fabulous by Poundland standards.)

The arcade ticket booth is open from 9AM till 10PM. That's when we are paid up to. Not 10:30 or anythin. Closes at 10PM, and we go home. Usually there is only one attendant in the arcade. 

One night at 9:56PM a guy was walking past. He'd maybe been in the club with his kids, watching the entertainment. He asked, ""Is that you finished now?""

I replied, ""Almost.""

""Alright, we'll be back shortly with tickets."" and he disappeared. 

I continued cleaning the machine I was cleaning, Then looked at my phone, 22:01. Time to go. I lowered the curtain in the ticket booth and left. 

I was in the next morning. He asked why I hadn't stayed. I told him I was finished work at 10PM. He said that he was hoping to leave early in the morning but had to stay untill 9 to trade in his tickets for my junk. I refused to apologise.

  
""Shortly with ticktes""

Define ""shortly,"" it was clearly more than 4 minutes for him. Would he have been there at 10:02PM? OR would there have happened to be, say, family guy on TV and he wanted to stop to watch that then come back half an hour later.

Define ""With tickets."" He could have them all neat, a few receipts with the values. They've decided ahead of time what they want and take no time. OR They could have countless little recepts, Crumpled up in different pockets, as I'm adding them up they are throwing more crumpled receipts on my desk, the first kid takes ages deciding, when they finally do the second kid who hasn't even started looking yet starts to decide, after taking an age they choose something, the one thing that the first kid didn't notice and the first kid is now trying to decide what they should put back to get it, as they are doing that the second kid changes their mind on what they want... and so on. Might be that they haven't even shredded all their tickets yet and still need to. 

I didn't want to hang about to find out which scenario(or any possibility between) it would be.

I tell my mom, “hey mom, I just wanted to let you know (my rabbit’s name) only needs kale twice a week otherwise she could get GI stasis blockage and that is a deadly condition” and she scoffed and said “I don’t give it to her that often!” And I said, “I’m sorry, she only needs it twice a week and you gave it to her for the past three days. I only say this to look out for my rabbit’s health”

My rabbit is my emotional support animal that helps me with my severe depression and anxiety.

4,1efeosf,AITA for taking away my MIL’s grandma nickname,"TA, another post inspired me to ask.
 
My family has a sentimental grandma nickname that has been used every few generations. Fake name, Nini. My family has a lot of Nini lore, and being a Nini is taken seriously. I grew up listening to my mom talk about her Nini, and how she was so excited to be a Nini to my future kids. My grandma was not a Nini and not very involved, so my kids having a Nini was something I also looked forward to. 

My MIL happens to be Nini to our niblings. Not a problem with that at all. However, her and I have a bad relationship, so I already wasn’t down for her to be my kid’s Nini. I did ask her, outside of the other kids using it, what made the name important to her. She said she just didn’t want to be Grandma, she felt the title made her seem old. I said that we’ll find a suitable nickname then, and she replied she’ll have all the nicknames. She told me my mom will be grandma and she’ll be everything else. 

I know both her and my mom can be Nini, but our bad relationship mixed with her calling dibs on every nickname made me decide to not call her Nini at all costs. My husband and I now have a toddler who is obsessed with their Nini (my mom). They don’t have a relationship with my MIL (in my opinion her choice) and doesn’t call her any specific grandmother name. It has been years but there is still grandma nickname drama and my MIL is still upset about it.

5,1efekks,"WIBTAH if I told my sister that I won't be a bridesmaid to her wedding, if she continues to treat me badly.","For background, last year, my sister signed up to the same to college and course as I did, after me, and at first I remained pessimistic about it, but then came round to the idea of not being alone and maybe it being fun. 

I am a foster child, and most people don't like us or they just see us as something that can be used in any way, shape or form. My sister promised me 2 days in a row that she wouldn't tell anyone I'm a foster child...- we weren't in the classroom for 5 minutes and she in her loudest voice told everyone there I was a foster child. That was strike 1. 

I made friends and for a little while we shared. This is a very long part of the story, so cutting down, my friends thought we were all tight knit. An issue arose (something I did that was harmless, but they found annoying), they went to my sister for advice, and she instead of having my back, told them to report me, for I needed to be reported for being horrible to my friends because I'd done it before (a lie). She made them panic, but as soon as I was reported, I was ignored by everyone and they spoke nastily about me behind my back. Soon everyone knew about the things I'd ""done"" and I was vicious and everyone had to say away from me. That was strike 2.

Even my foster parents knew, but they didn't want to tell me. Everyone inside and out of college knew, except me. It didn't end there, I spent my days alone and she slammed the door in my face, was rude about me behind me and in front of me. Saying she had to forgive me because I'm her sister (Again I did nothing wrong). It was only when I had a complete breakdown and wasn't being me, that's when my foster mum told me, and the rest I found out when I rebuilt that friendship she had ruined.

WIBTAH?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-29,"WIBTAH if I told my sister that I won't be a bridesmaid to her wedding, if she continues to treat me badly. For background, last year, my sister signed up to the same to college and course as I did, after me, and at first I remained pessimistic about it, but then came round to the idea of not being alone and maybe it being fun. 

I am a foster child, and most people don't like us or they just see us as something that can be used in any way, shape or form. My sister promised me 2 days in a row that she wouldn't tell anyone I'm a foster child...- we weren't in the classroom for 5 minutes and she in her loudest voice told everyone there I was a foster child. That was strike 1. 

I made friends and for a little while we shared. This is a very long part of the story, so cutting down, my friends thought we were all tight knit. An issue arose (something I did that was harmless, but they found annoying), they went to my sister for advice, and she instead of having my back, told them to report me, for I needed to be reported for being horrible to my friends because I'd done it before (a lie). She made them panic, but as soon as I was reported, I was ignored by everyone and they spoke nastily about me behind my back. Soon everyone knew about the things I'd ""done"" and I was vicious and everyone had to say away from me. That was strike 2.

Even my foster parents knew, but they didn't want to tell me. Everyone inside and out of college knew, except me. It didn't end there, I spent my days alone and she slammed the door in my face, was rude about me behind me and in front of me. Saying she had to forgive me because I'm her sister (Again I did nothing wrong). It was only when I had a complete breakdown and wasn't being me, that's when my foster mum told me, and the rest I found out when I rebuilt that friendship she had ruined.

6,1efeilo,AITA for snapping at my brother?,"Sorry if there are any grammar or spelling mistakes; English isn’t my first language.
On February 2nd, we threw a party for my (31F) grandma’s 80th birthday. My aunt gave her a large framed family photo from Christmas 2016, the last time we were all together before grandpa passed away, one uncle died during the pandemic, and a cousin moved to the USA in 2022. Grandma was so moved and she hung it in her living room.

My brother (28) and SIL (28) seemed uncomfortable with the photo, left the party, and later complained in the group chat that they were upset because my brother’s ex was in the picture. Brother said they didn’t say anything at the party to avoid upsetting Grandma, but he demanded an apology from my aunt.

My aunt apologized, said she didn’t notice the ex in the photo (our family is huge, almost 30 people in that picture), and offered to replace it with a photoshopped version next time she visited Grandma. My brother agreed, and we thought it was over. But my aunt took almost a month to replace the photo, and my brother kept asking about it in the group chat, which I ignored, not my business anyway. 

After the picture was replaced, my brother dropped the issue until Mother’s Day when he said he and his wife might skip a family reunion at Grandma’s because they still felt disrespected since the last family function. I found that ridiculous because my aunt already apologized and fixed the issue, but I didn’t say anything. They ended up coming anyway.

Yesterday, when we got invited to my cousin’s quinceañera (the daughter of the aunt that missed the picture), my brother said the same thing about how they might skip because last time he and his wife were disrespected . I lost my cool and told him he was making a big deal out of nothing, and if he kept being a pain in the a** no one would miss him at the party. Now he’s mad at me. AITA?

7,1efei1m,AITA for asking my roommate to pay for a new mattress topper? ,"Fist of all: not a native speaker, hope you can still understand

So two weeks ago my roommate (F,33) and I (F,35) had a pretty big argument and I am really not sure what to think about it.

In the past, I told my roommate that if I am not around, someone could sleep in my room, if need be. 

The thing is: I do not have a typical bed, since I wanted to have more space in my somewhat tiny room. I sleep on a japanese futon. To maintain the quality of said futon, you have to roll it up every day, you should use a tatami mat as an underlay and you should use a special bedsheet to absorb moisture, since moisture is really bad for the futon and you can’t wash it. Since the futon alone is a little too firm for me, I put an extra mattress topper on it, which you also can’t wash. (This is important for the rest of the story.) My roommate knows about all of those things. 

So if I say “someone can sleep in that room” I am clearly not saying/implying “someone could sleep on my futon” and I do not understand how you could get that from my statement. 

To give you more context: I am struggling with trauma, anxiety around health issues and contamination and I do have trust issues and a big problem with people drinking too much alcohol, because of said trauma. My roommate also knows that. 

So what happened was this: 
I was not home that night. She had a friend over for one evening, it was in no way planned for that friend to stay the night, but my roommate got incredibly drunk, it got late, her friend didn’t want to drive home that night and my roommate just took out my futon and the mattress topper, didn’t even place the tatami underneath, did not put the special bedsheet on top and let her friend sleep on it. 

She did not ask permission for that, I don’t know if or when she would have told me about that anyway, I just found out about it because I wanted to quickly grab something I had forgotten in my room and it happened to be the day after her drinking incident. 

So she just took my (expensive!!!) futon, did not ask me beforehand, did not use it in the right way, let a person sleep on there who I don’t even know, was probably not even going to tell me and when I confronted her about it, all she basically said was “Well I am just a human and I make mistakes and now you have to live with that”. 

Tbh I am furious. She very well knows about my anxieties and still thought it was ok to let a (to me) total stranger sleep in my bed? Is that a normal thing to assume?? Are other people ok with strangers sleeping in their bed??? 

Like I said before, I do not have the ability to wash the futon and the mattress topper. I am grossed out, I do not feel comfortable to sleep on the topper anymore and I will have to buy a new one.
My partner said that my roommate should pay for it and I kinda also agree on that. So after telling her, her response was „Of course I am NOT going to pay for that“ 

So AITA for asking her to pay for the new topper? I honestly really can’t tell.

9,1efe99e,AITA for “butting in” to my friends marriage’s finances?,"My(34F) friend (32F) is talking about having a baby with her husband (35M). She is debating being a stay at home mom and her husbands wants her to be one. Up to now she has been very yes kids but keep my career. She is very worried about being trapped financially or dependent financially on a partner (she had a financially/emotionally controlling relationship in the past).

In my relationship my husband is our SAHD and I am the “breadwinner”. We are a common law relationship and as part of me and my partner having a child we sat down and talked about and then wrote out and had notarized a “child care compensation” agreement and a child custody on separation agreement. The child care compensation one is the important one for this conversation. 

Our “contract” outlined that my partner would leave his current job to become a stay at home dad and I would pay him x amount monthly (just under current daycare rates) from this amount I would remove 1/2 rent 1/2 bills & 200 child expenses (towards groceries) I paid for the rest of groceries/child needs. This left him x amount for himself/discretionary spending. We did this due to the common law nature of our relationship to protect us both if we ever split to prove finances and preferred custody. It’s a safety net for both of us. 

Even though my friend is legally married I suggested to her to sit down and make the same type of agreement with her husband. Don’t bother to get it notarized but this way you both have an agreed document you can fall back on if finances become a disagreement and you will have talked it out and be on the same page when it’s in writing.  This way to she will have a set amount to work with every month that is “hers” so she can decide to get shoes or a coffee or a toy for her kid from her money without having to ask permission for every additional expense or have someone monitoring her spending as it would go to her own account.

So my wife’s sister and her fiancé are both currently in med school. Over the past two years we’ve intermittently watched her dogs, sometimes up to 3 months at a time, until now… Currently we have been watching them both for 3 months and they have said it’ll be “at least another 5 months” before they can consider taking them back. 

Back story: 

Wife’s sister has had one dog for 4 years, and 2 years ago this sister decides to buy another one. Meanwhile, she still has around 5 years left of med school, and is having trouble taking care of the dog she currently has. So that responsibility has fallen on us. Her parents will help out for a day or two, but are busy themselves and already own 7 dogs. 

I like dogs, but this is too much. This new dog is high energy, constantly barking, needing to be let out in the middle of the night. Every time we have guests they jump on them when they walk inside, it’s embarrassing. On top of that the young one has a very delicate stomach and has literally pooped 14 times on our brand new basement carpet. I could go on… I’ve had it. 

I understand her sister is busy, she’s does clinical shifts around the country and is staying at Airbnbs for 3-6months at a time. I’m sure it is very tough taking care of these dogs while she tries to do school, but she chose to to buy the dogs. 

Today: 

This morning I sent a message to my wife’s sister and her fiancé, asking about giving me a better timeline for when they can take them back. Because at this point all I’ve heard is “at least 5 months”. My wife got very upset with me and said Iam rude for asking them that because they are so busy. I told her that I’ve had it with the dogs and her sister needs to figure out a way to take care of them because it’s her responsibility, regardless of whether she has the time or not. She chose to buy them and should have to deal with the repercussions. We’ve helped her out for years, and I can’t handle it anymore.

I needed a break in between due to school. We are in the same friend group so early into the relationship or whatever I decided to end it as I was not reciprocating the feelings he had and believed if would be best for us as friends to end it early. This was back in May. Its important to note that he approached me wanting a friends with benefit relationship with me but later told me he wanted more. Another important note: he said in front of me that he would never date a white girl (I am white). I ended things because his behavior in the relationship did not make me comfortable with dating him (ie: telling me not to be independent, being at my apartment all the time immediately, talking to all of our friends but me about us, him pouting for the entire night hang with our friends after telling him he was being too touchy in front of them, and overall acting like a child). THREE MONTHS after ending it, he still has feelings for me. 

I tried my hardest after ending things to maintain a relationship. I gave him space for almost a month understanding that he needed a bit of time. I communicated with him regularly and even invited him to an event with me. Every time he was upset about us, it was on me to initiate conversation to work things out between us. 

We had a trip planned as a group in July for his birthday. After we ended things, I told him repeatedly that I did not want to go on the trip and pay a lot of money just to be alienated or him just to decide not to be friends with me. He ensured me that he wanted me to go. We went on the trip last weekend. Shocker, he ignored me most of the time and when he wasn’t he was giving me attitude. When he was drunk and obviously showing interest in me, I made sure to defuse the situation. 

He told me a few days ago that he did not want to be friends with me (another conversation that I had to initiate). All of the conversations we had were HOURS long. So I needed to have another 2 hours conversation with him for him to accuse me of not caring about him despite the effort I made that he did not even reciprocate in the slightest. 

So now, I have asked him for the money for the gift I bought him under the impression we were friends. I have also asked for some money for the other expenses I paid after repeatedly asking him to just tell me he didn’t want me on the trip. I spent almost $300 for this trip.

13,1efdlgc,AITA for not inviting my friend to the beach,"I had this friendgroup a couple of years ago.
Lets call them S(26) M(30) and N(28) and me (29).
l know N from highschool, M from college and S became M's roomate, they ended up dating.
At some point I had a falling out with S. Its a bit much to go into detail. She didnt feel heard and I felt like I had to walk on eggshels. So There was a big fight and we didn""t speak for 2 years.

I was still friends with M and N. N severed her contact with S too since she felt the same way. I never asked her to do that. If she wanted to be friends with her that was fine by me.

M was still in a relationship with S. In this time it was quiet hard to get a hold of M since she would allways get into a fight with S whenever she would hang out with us so at some point I kinda stopped trying.
M was one of my best friends but I didnt want to force anything.

2 years later S and I by request of M made up. We decided to have a friendship apart from the group cause we felt the group dynamic especially M and S in the relationship.

Things were fine, M and S broke up which was sad  but it was ok. The relationship wasnt really on a stable basis anyway. I thought it was best for them both.
N never made up with S, which was fine by me. She isnt interested in speaking with her again. Shes fine being friendly with her at parties but she doesnt feel the need to be in her presence if it is not required.
Now comes the crux of the story. N and I  live as neighbours in the same building, so at the moment we are quiet close. I keep S and N separated as much as possible to keep the peace and to respect N's wishes and boundaries. 

A few weeks ago N and I had an appointment near M's place so we asked to hang out afterwards. The appointment was pushed to a later date so we had the whole day and wanted to go to the beach.
M mentioned S maybe coming by that morning but that it wasnt a set date yet so we could go on and plan things.

2 days before the date I got a text from  S, she was hurt by my actions. She heard some stuff from M. She was open to talk about it but she was really hurt.
I was confused so I immediately asked to call. So we did. She told me she felt excluded in our plans. So I was very confused about this since she knows its not up to me.

She told me M and her had plans and she took a day free from work to hang out with M. I asked her, what does that have to do with me? I was hanging out already with N and its up to M what she does. She proceeded to tell me that she feels like shes chosen second and feels hurt we cant hang out with the 4 of us.

I feel like I dont have anything to do with what was going on between M and S. And I was sucked into the drama.

I didnt apologise. I told her I was hanging out with N first, M second and that she had to figure this out with M.

In the end M chose to hang out with us. she said we were first. S says something different. I dont know what the truth is. 
If you want to know more details ask me, theres more to it.

I (48 F) am choosing not to go to my daughter's wedding because she contacted her grandmother on my late-husband's side. Let me explain, 25ish years ago, my father in law called me on the phone to say that I had ""over spent on my wedding"" and that it was a reflection of me being ""snotty"" and ""stuck up."" I was very hurt and so was my husband. My husband called his dad demanding he apologize, but his dad refused. His mom called to apologize, but my husband and i agreed that it didn't count unless his dad said sorry. in the end, we cut contact with his whole side of the family so that we could start fresh.

Every once in a while my kids would talk about meeting their cousins on my husbands side or ask to hear stories about my husband growing up in indiana and each time I would get so upset because I remembered how his dad made me feel. Well, now my kids are grown up and my husband has since passed away. My daughter announced to me fairly recently that she had gotten engaged to her long time boyfriend. I was initially happy for her until i saw the guest list. almost half of my daughter's side was my husbands family. she had confessed to meeting many of them and keeping in steady contact with her Grandma.

I told her that I would not financially contribute to the wedding and did not plan to go if his family attended. My new fiance said I was in the wrong, but my daughter broke a well established family rule. Am i the butthole?

edit: i looked over everything, and will go to my daughters wedding and keep to myself. i dont plan to contribute much otherwise

15,1efd9vl,AITA for laughing at my sister's first acting job and giving harsh feedback?,"My sister recently booked her first acting job in a low budget film--her role was a supporting news anchor. We were all excited to watch it (iphone clip someone on set filmed, not the final cut)

And honestly...I feel bad for her. She completely dropped the ball. Her performance was terrible and she doesn't even realize it. For example, her line was ""a major uprising has occurred in the city"" and she pronounced it whiny and annoying and grating like ""a MAAAJJJOR uprising has occured"". Like a goat...random emphasis on the word major. 

Even in the iphone clip she showed us you can see people confused and some exchanging glances and smiling not because she's good but because it's cringy. She was also stiff and her performance was very goofy and awkward.

She asked us how she did/if it will make the final cut and we couldn't help but laugh and mock her. We then told her the truth that her style was weird and she needed to speak in a more regular professional tone then be all over the place emphasizing random words.

It should be noted that she also LIED about anchor experience (she has none) and said she was experienced in TV news reading to get the job, and she justified this by saying she interviews clients for her business a lot, even though that has nothing to do with the news. 

She then broke down in tears and is now mad at us and worried she won't be in the film, that this was her first big ""movie role"" and was supposed to be her springboard and now she thinks she's screwed. She honestly was shocked when we told her it was cringe. The director obviously was embarrassed but too nice to tell her the way she was reading was weird. But I think she's immature for not taking our feedback.

She married my Dad when I was 7, I consider her my Dad's wife not my step mom. She was never married or in a relationship before my dad, so she has no kids.

Ever since they got married, she always fucking hugs me and my brother and kisses us. She also has to kiss me on both of my cheeks, and the hug/kissing lasts 1-2 minutes.

In 2019, I got fed up and looked the other way so she wouldn't kiss me, and she legit threw a tantrum (mind you, she was 50 back then) and got super butthurt.

17,1efcxc3,AITA for telling my addict brother he cannot live in my home,"My (49M) brother (47M) is an addict and a liar. His drinking has cost him time with his son, his home, and at times his freedom. He has been on a several week bender, spending his days drinking into a stupor, not going to work, and calling anyone that will answer asking them to help solve his problems.

He has claimed he was going to AA meetings since getting arrested for being drunk in public while he had his son during a scheduled visit. Turns out, he has not been going to AA, that was a lie. He stopped paying rent so now he has no place to live but his car. 

He has always had an addictive personality, and has relied on others to help keep him clean. His ex is a saint that spent years helping him, but he never learned to help himself.

I have my own home, both my kids have moved out. I live here alone, while my fiancé visits a couple nights a week, and a couple of nights I am at her house. My brother has asked multiple times to stay with me, and I have told him no for the following reasons:

- I do not trust him, the continued lies about his drinking, AA, and many other fabrications are draining
- I do not trust that he can be in my home alone. He trashed his own place while on a bender. Him living with me feels like I will have to become his caretaker to ensure my place is not destroyed. I do not want to be trapped in my home to protect it from him.
- Before his divorce he was seeing another woman in the town where my youngest child lives. He used popping in on them at work as an excuse to see the other woman.
- I plan on selling my house in the next 6-9 months, and I do not want to have to answer the question “where do I go now?” from him. I also don’t not want to battle kicking him out.

I feel like he needs to hit rock bottom. He needs to feel the pain of his decisions on his comfort and I do not believe he will get that living with me. Giving him a place to live feels like enabling his bad behavior, and trapping me into a role I do not want.

We were only supposed to get tipsy at most and be back before 12. Me(20) and my friend Allison(21) were fine. My friend Bianca(20) drank a ridiculous amount before me and Allison could realize how bad she was. She had way more than we had agreed on. 
     
     We walked and took a train. When we got to the club after walking, the bouncer said she would have to sober up to get in, so we walked to a hotel bathroom so we could all pee and drink water. 
     
     Instead of getting better, Bianca lays down on the bathroom floor and completely blacks out. Me and Allison spend the next 2 1/2 hours in the bathroom trying to get her to stand, but just keep failing. We genuinely thought we were going to have to call an ambulance. 
     
     I tried making her throw up so many times and it was not helping, that’s how much she had drank. We had throw up all over our clothes and shoes, it reeked. Me and Allison would take turns holding her up on the toilet which is hard when someone is completely limp. 
     
     We eventually call my sister and ask what to do, she agrees to pick us up.  
     
     The next morning we all wake up and Bianca acts like everything was fine. We explain everything that happened and she says, “Well at least we had fun”🤡 Like no we most definitely did not have fun sitting in a hotel bathroom for 2 1/2 hours that reeked of vomit to babysit you. 

     She didn’t apologize or even look a little bit fazed. My sister’s cloth seated car also reeked of vomit and smelled sour,  so my sister asked me to have them chip in to help get it cleaned. Bianca would not respond to my messages. She thought it was completely unfair and not her responsibility to pay for the smell to be cleaned out. Even had the audacity to say that she never agreed to being picked up by my sister which is why she shouldn’t be responsible for it. 

     Oh, I’m sorry let me call the ambulance and let you get in trouble with your parents, or leave you on the bathroom floor?! I couldn’t really ask her if she was okay with it because she was BLACKED OUT.

20,1efbz6b,AITA for lighting a cig while waiting in a parking lot for an adjacent car to finish loading?,"I was leaving a hardware store and saw a couple loading thier SUV on my drivers side.  Their side door was open so I couldn't get into my car.

I personally didn't have anything to load, don't know how long they will take, and so decided to make myself look busy while they finished loading and reached into my passenger side, got a cigarette, and lit it.

The husband was loading the back of the SUV while the wife was loading a child in the backseat of the SUV.  (I don't recall even seeing she was loading a child until after I lit my cig).

22,1efbcr0,AITA for defending my boyfriend when my mother branded him as disrespectful for telling her I need space?,"Hi all! This all started a few days ago, I wanted to cook a recipe me(18F) and my boyfriend(18M) had been meaning to try for some time, since he was staying over. My mum had been in a bit of a sour mood all day, at first she offered to buy the ingredients herself before refusing to at the last minute, so my boyfriend and I happily went out and got the ingredients ourselves. Keep in mind, this recipe was only for me and him. My mum was going to eat something else, which she prepared AND ate while I was still cooking.

All was well until I began cooking, my mum began criticizing almost everything I was doing, saying things like ""there's barely any soup"" ""you're going to give (bfs name) food poisoning"" ""you've messed it all up"" ""you're going to leave (bfs name) starving"". I have autism and find it difficult to multitask and process information as is, so trying to juggle the cooking while my mum was telling me everything I'm doing wrong at the same time, certainly wasn't a good mix.

It became so overwhelming that I burst into tears while I was still cooking. My boyfriend, who was sitting next to me, rushed to comfort me as soon as possible and wrapped his arms around me, helping me calm down. He's always been very understanding of the problems I face because of my autism. My mum somehow didn't take it as a cue to stop trying to engage with me when I repeatedly had told her to let me focus on the cooking, so she also didn't stop when I burst into tears.

My boyfriend, who was still comforting me, intervened and politely spoke on my behalf to tell her: ""(My name) is overwhelmed right now and needs the time and space to process, I think it's best that you two stay apart for the time being so we can calm down."" Little did we know, my mum would perceive this as quote, ""highly disrespectful"". She hastily told him that he needed to leave the following day, and that it was ""her house, her rules."" He didn't even raise his voice, it was his regular speaking tone and his body language towards my mother was alike that of trying to calm someone down, with a gently motioning outstretched hand.

The irony of all this? The recipe turned out great, the only issue is that I made too small of a portion. Both me and my boyfriend enjoyed it, and we had a takeaway afterwards so we'd have a little more to eat. But my mum, days later, still insists that my boyfriend was disrespectful, and no longer wants me and him to be in contact. When I ask her, she insists she ""just knew"" it was disrespectful. She's also getting incredibly angry at me for defending him, threatening to kick me out.

23,1efbast,AITA for telling my wife what my sister said about her?,"About 2 years ago I’m sitting at dinner with my immediate family, mom (65), dad (60), sister (42), and myself (M30). The conversation shifts to why my gf (now my wife (28)) isn’t there. I can’t remember the exact words used leading up to this point, but eventually my sister says, “you know, I always preferred Monick”.

Some necessary contexts:

The relationship I have with my sister is basically nonexistent. She’s my half-sister (shared mother) that I have literally, not for a single day, lived with. We were essentially raised by 2 entirely different families, and therefore grew up to be entirely different people. She’s 12 years my senior. We have NOTHING in common. I believe if we didn’t share a mother, I wouldn’t know who this person was, and would have no desire to get to know her. I personally find her rude and just a bad person in general.

Now, I’m jarred by this. I have no idea what this adds to the conversation. My dad though, to his credit, immediately has my back, pointing out that sister doesn’t know all the nuances to the relationship and it’s not her place to comment on whether it could have worked out or not. I point out that Monick was very clingy and jealous, which is why I decided to end the relationship. Sister just shrugs the answer off.

At this point in my wife and mine’s relationship, even though we weren’t married yet, we were very serious. We had already bought a house together, adopted a new dog, and were discussing getting married/having a child. We had been together a little over a year. So, when I hear that my sister, who I barely even like, say that she prefers I was with someone else, I go home and tell my wife.

My reasoning for this was that she was going to be seeing my sister for the next 40 years or so. It would be so weird knowing what I know and my wife still treating this woman like family. It seems only fair that my wife knows what this woman thinks about her if she’s going to be seeing her. Plus, if she would have found out what was said from someone else, that would have been bad. She would feel totally excluded from my family (her words).

So now we're 2 years in the future, and on July 20th, 2024, we discover we're finally pregnant after almost a year of trying. We're ecstatic. on the 25th, we get married at the courthouse. Thinking we needed 2 witnesses; I invite both my parents. My mother mentions that my sister would like to be there. Without consulting my wife, I refuse my mother's request on the grounds that it would make things awkward for my wife, and she wouldn't get to enjoy her ceremony. I tell my mother that if my sister apologized, it would be a way to start mending the relationship to the point where she could see her niece/nephew. Until then, nothing I can do for her.

 As a friend, I always am the one to help her, and I always try my best to help her get through the problem(s). But anything I suggest to do, she says, ""I can't because of..."" And usually the ""because"" is something that can be fixed, ex. Her not feeling confident, her feeling annoying, and more.

 I always am trying to help, so if she says that, I hype her up, but it usually ends in her saying ""sure"" and then ignoring every text that she gets. This can get annoying, so sometimes, I can be a little rude, giving the advice

 So recently, if she's been asking for help, like normal, I've been giving my advice, and then she gives her reasoning of why she can't.

25,1efan4h,AITA for telling my FIL that I don't want the house he bought us?,"My FIL is generous man, but has what he refers to as ""the asshole gene"" meaning that he doesn't stop to consider what anyone else wants in many situations. Since my husband and I have been living with my husband's brother, FIL decided that when the neighbor's house went on the market for a steal, he'd buy us the house. After consulting with his financial planner, the decision was made to have both FIL and my husband on the title/deed to the house. We would pay all taxes and utilities, and when FIL passes, husband would inherit the house. 

Here's where it gets messy.  The house needs a lot of work. Originally, husband and I were going to be responsible for improvements and repairs, so I started meeting with contractors and getting estimates for the work. My husband doesn't know much about home repair or renovation, and I do (my family has renovated multiple old homes) so he's been letting me handle all of the work with the contractors. Even so, FIL will not speak directly to me about anything related to the house. My poor husband has to play messenger, telling me what his dad wants to do, then telling his dad that I've actually got it handled, and want to do something different. 

The final straw came today when my husband relayed to me that his dad has said that any permanent changes to the house that cost more than $5,000 have to be approved by him. Even if we're paying for them, he wants to sign off on any/all decisions, including tile colors, light fixtures, etc. So I forwarded all of my communication with the contractor we'd chosen (haven't signed anything yet) and said that if he wants to make the decisions, then he can make ALL the decisions. He will own the house, and we will sign a rental lease when the work is done. He'll have to pass city inspections for rental units, and abide by all state and local rental law. 

Now he's mad, and I'm ungrateful, selfish and controlling. At this point, I don't even want the house anymore. I'm ready to take the cat and go stay with my brother, but I don't actually want to leave my husband, I'm just sick of catering to his dad's whims. 

*One day later* Thanks for the gut check guys. I read through most of your comments although I didn't reply to most of them. I realize how incredibly privileged we are to be in this position. I never had any intention of doing any work on the house without FIL's approval, but we've already discussed what we were going to do, and he agreed that I should go ahead and find a contractor. Then he changed the rules. 
I had dinner with my MIL (divorced from FIL) last night to commiserate about what a butthead he can be. She gave me some good advice on dealing with him. 
The bottom line is that we are not putting a single cent into a home unless we BOTH have a legal stake in it.

26,1efamqa,AITA for telling my mom I don’t want her “friend” to come over,"Using a throwaway account for privacy.

I (21F) live rent-free at home with my mom (43F) while I’m in school as long as I maintain good grades and save 95% of my income (she checks). We’ve always been close, especially after she left my father due to him abusing me. A few years ago, my mom started dating a man I’ll call Mike. They were together for about 8 years, and I considered him a step-dad until they broke up because he was became very distant.

About six months after their official breakup, they got back together. My mom assured me she wouldn’t bring Mike around until we had a chance to talk things out, acknowledging that he had hurt me in the past. Whenever I came home, Mike would be asked to leave, which worked well for us. They broke up again about two months later.

It’s been a year and a half since that breakup. My mom has been on and off dating apps, and I’ve been very supportive throughout. I listen to her insecurities, celebrate her victories, and offer support during tough times.

A month ago, my mom started seeing Mike again, but she insists it’s just as friends. They’ve hung out a few times, had drinks, and even slept in the same bed one night because he was too drunk to drive home. (She says nothing happened between them, and I believe her.) Despite my concerns about her getting hurt again, I’m trying to be supportive.

Well, if it wasn't for one thing.

See, the situation is slightly complicated because I live with her. When they broke up, I lost him as a dad. And because of this, I do not want to be forced to see him before I’m ready.

I understand my mom is an adult and it’s her house, so she has the right to make her own choices. She has invited other men over from her dates, but she always asked first, and I’ve agreed because I want her to be happy.

But it’s hard to avoid Mike when he’s over, especially since I’m not allowed to stay anywhere else, (she threatens to stop supporting me,) and I can’t afford my own place while I’m in school. Recently, my mom and Mike helped replace a part on my car, and my mom insisted I sit down with Mike and thank him. I appreciated the help but didn’t like being forced to interact with someone who has hurt me in the past.

I’ve told my mom that I don’t want Mike over when I’m there and that my feelings haven’t been considered. She got very upset, and says I’m being unsupportive and forcing her to be lonely.

Given how much Mike has hurt me, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to expect my mom to respect my feelings like she did when they first got back together. So, am I the asshole for not wanting my mom’s “friend” to come over?",Asshole,2024-07-29,"AITA for telling my mom I don’t want her “friend” to come over Using a throwaway account for privacy.

I (21F) live rent-free at home with my mom (43F) while I’m in school as long as I maintain good grades and save 95% of my income (she checks). We’ve always been close, especially after she left my father due to him abusing me. A few years ago, my mom started dating a man I’ll call Mike. They were together for about 8 years, and I considered him a step-dad until they broke up because he was became very distant.

About six months after their official breakup, they got back together. My mom assured me she wouldn’t bring Mike around until we had a chance to talk things out, acknowledging that he had hurt me in the past. Whenever I came home, Mike would be asked to leave, which worked well for us. They broke up again about two months later.

It’s been a year and a half since that breakup. My mom has been on and off dating apps, and I’ve been very supportive throughout. I listen to her insecurities, celebrate her victories, and offer support during tough times.

A month ago, my mom started seeing Mike again, but she insists it’s just as friends. They’ve hung out a few times, had drinks, and even slept in the same bed one night because he was too drunk to drive home. (She says nothing happened between them, and I believe her.) Despite my concerns about her getting hurt again, I’m trying to be supportive.

Well, if it wasn't for one thing.

27,1efampz,AITA for standing up to my (F19) friend (F19) for neglecting her pet's wellbeing?,"Hi everyone. Just thought I'd try and get some feedback on something that happened tonight. 

A few days ago, a friend of mine confided in me and told me she was struggling financially. She was worried she wouldn't be able to buy food for herself and other basic necessities for the forseeable future (she's unemployed and has no desire to work.) I did what i could to offer my support, and then went about my day. 

Later that day she messaged me to inform me she'd bought a kitten. For what reason I'm not too sure. It seemed clear to me she'd used the last of her money to impulsively buy the cat. When she told me about the cat i immediately had concerns, specifically about how she was going to provide for her new companion while she was struggling to provide for herself. It became clear to me that she'd not thought the decision through, and i was immediately annoyed at my friend, but also worried for the cat's wellbeing. 

All this happened a few days ago. And earlier tonight i decided i was going to politely raise my concerns. I mean, she'd personally vented to me about her financial worries, and if it concerns an animal's wellbeing i didn't think i was wrong to have questions. I called my friend and (clearly and respectfully) asked if she had a plan to make sure both her and the cat were provided for. I let her know that i trusted her completely, but I'd decided to talk to her for my own peace of mind. When i asked the question she said nothing, and suddenly hung up the phone within seconds. I know this friend struggles to take criticism, so i wasn't fully surprised at her reaction, but i didn't take it to heart because i feel like I'd been careful and friendly in my approach. 

At this point in time i can confidently assume she's annoyed at me. But despite how the conversation went, I'm feeling pretty content. I feel like i did the right thing by encouraging hee to think from the animal's perspective and not just her own. If it's the end of our friendship, i can live with that. I'd have preferred to say something then say nothing. And I'm certainly not going to compromise my morals to appease someone who's capable of behaving like that. But i can also appreciate that i may be biased.

And then someone she knows commented back to me some religious crap so I, admittedly, responded in a way I knew would anger this person- I basically said 'I love drag queens, they are so nice!' and told her I have a great memory of taking my daughter to a show.

I don’t know if this is in context but they’re going to be getting married next year and will have a big wedding, (my husbands paid for the most part of it) I obviously will be expected to go and celebrate. But I don’t feel like they want me to be around with how she behaves (however always cordial in front of others) she is not particularly nice to me, but she hasn’t been outright nasty either. We’ve got no reason to have any unpleasantness, we live across the world , I’m generally considered a warm outgoing person and a girls girl.

32,1ef9p1o,AITA for yelling at my Mom to stop treating my girlfriend like shit because of how she’s grieving her Mom’s death?,"My (31M) girlfriend (29F) Shev’s (short for Siobhan) mom died after a battle with liver failure due to psych overmedication. It was horrible and one of the worst things I’ve ever gone through and she wasn’t even MY mom. Shev and I have been together since college so I knew her well.

Shev is going through it. And one of her big coping mechanisms is Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour. She watches the livestreams and keeps up with all the new things going on, and for the Swifties, she loves watching the mashups and playing the Mastermind game.

We didn't get to go. We had tickets to our city, but had to sell them to help pay for her mom’s funeral. (No, we didn’t hike up the price). So part of this coping mechanism probably has to do with missing out on “her” show. I would do anything to be able to take her, but I know it won't happen.

So here’s the issue. Mom dropped by and Shev was in her blanket nest watching and my mom ended up making fun of her and calling her a pathetic baby. My mom isn’t the warmest person, but she’s never been outright cruel to Shev so it was a shock.

People turn to drinking, doing crazy shit to cope with hard times and all my girlfriend wants to do is watch the Eras tour surprise songs for 15 minutes and then play Stardew Valley and take walks.

When I confronted my mom, I asked why she had to try to hurt Shev when she’s already going through enough?

She turned it into this big thing about how she can’t stand Taylor Swift and she’s the worst, she’s greedy, lip syncs, victim, stupid, etc etc. It had nothing to do with Shev, it’s about her personally not liking Taylor Swift. And that just set me off.

I ended up “yelling” at her (I don’t really raise my voice) that she was being cruel to a grieving woman who is doing nothing wrong. And that if she wants me to continue to help pay for her groceries, I want her to apologize and just be NICE. She doesn’t have to like Taylor Swift, not everyone does, but don’t be cruel. Someone else liking something you don't isn't a reason to treat them poorly.

She told me that I was being a shitty son and “picking some stupid pop slut” over her. I told her no, that’s not what’s happening, but if she wants to lie to herself, I can’t stop her.

My brothers are all pissed off at me for this, telling me that now she’s bugging them and bitching their ears off because I’m such an ungrateful bastard.

34,1ef9l2f,AITA for getting my friend's parents to disown her and telling her that I support their decision 100%?,"My friend ""Brenda"" is dating this guy, ""Brad"".

Brad has a daughter whom he abandoned at birth, and is currently paying 8% of his monthly salary for as child support.

Brenda is extremely supportive of Brad's decision and always complains that he should not even pay child support because if it's ""her body, her choice"" then it should also be ""his life, his choice"" and ""his wallet, his choice"". She supports him 100% and she also never plans on having children.

Personally, I am extremely against child abandonment, regardless of gender, hence why I we are not as close as we used to be. She is aware of this, as I've backed out as a friend before on a common friend that decided to be a long term mistress for a married man, and she knows my morals, and that there are certain people I just would prefer not to be around, so I don't think Brenda's shocked, I don't think she cared much because she found the love of her life. (but this post is not asking about having boundaries, denying relationship...etc and things of that nature)

However, I am still extremely close to her family because we are family friends. As more time went on, her family felt weirded out that I'm not as active with Brenda as I used to and asked me about it.

This is where I might've been the AH because it lead to a lot of things. I was honest and told them why and they were shocked. They were worried that this guy will abandon Brenda to be a single mother if she were to get pregnant. I assured them that it won't happen because Brenda made it clear that she doesn't plan on ever becoming a mother.

Anyways, after this, apparently, her father went to confirm if what I said was true or not. After getting an affirmative answer, it strained the relationship between Brenda and him. And he would eventually practically put her off from his will.

I'm not sure the details, Brenda tells people that she's cut off. Her family claims that it's not true, it's just that Brenda is not getting anything from dad that's worth much money anymore. Though I'm not certain if it has anything to do with her position in parenthood, dating choices, and the fact that she don't want children, it probably does (maybe along with other reasons I'm not aware of). I personally believe the family members that are watching from the side more than Brenda.

Anyways, this is also where I might be the AH, Brenda is extremely upset and indirectly blames it on me, and complain about how unfair it is and how her father has a responsibility to her...etc. I felt bad for her so I don't really care much.

But eventually, as she kept it going, I flipped and replied that it's ""my life, my choice"", I can give my words to whoever I want. And I support him 100% and that it is ""his life his choice, his wallet, his choice"". He's just doing what she supports. Brenda became extremely upset and pissed.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-29,"AITA for getting my friend's parents to disown her and telling her that I support their decision 100%? My friend ""Brenda"" is dating this guy, ""Brad"".

Brad has a daughter whom he abandoned at birth, and is currently paying 8% of his monthly salary for as child support.

Brenda is extremely supportive of Brad's decision and always complains that he should not even pay child support because if it's ""her body, her choice"" then it should also be ""his life, his choice"" and ""his wallet, his choice"". She supports him 100% and she also never plans on having children.

Personally, I am extremely against child abandonment, regardless of gender, hence why I we are not as close as we used to be. She is aware of this, as I've backed out as a friend before on a common friend that decided to be a long term mistress for a married man, and she knows my morals, and that there are certain people I just would prefer not to be around, so I don't think Brenda's shocked, I don't think she cared much because she found the love of her life. (but this post is not asking about having boundaries, denying relationship...etc and things of that nature)

However, I am still extremely close to her family because we are family friends. As more time went on, her family felt weirded out that I'm not as active with Brenda as I used to and asked me about it.

This is where I might've been the AH because it lead to a lot of things. I was honest and told them why and they were shocked. They were worried that this guy will abandon Brenda to be a single mother if she were to get pregnant. I assured them that it won't happen because Brenda made it clear that she doesn't plan on ever becoming a mother.

Anyways, after this, apparently, her father went to confirm if what I said was true or not. After getting an affirmative answer, it strained the relationship between Brenda and him. And he would eventually practically put her off from his will.

I'm not sure the details, Brenda tells people that she's cut off. Her family claims that it's not true, it's just that Brenda is not getting anything from dad that's worth much money anymore. Though I'm not certain if it has anything to do with her position in parenthood, dating choices, and the fact that she don't want children, it probably does (maybe along with other reasons I'm not aware of). I personally believe the family members that are watching from the side more than Brenda.

I did not think I ever did anything to them, but the sister did not like me before I even met her and when I first met her she treated me badly. Never spoke to me when I went over to their house and had a nasty attitude towards me. MIL seemed nice but over the years I became the target of mean girl behavior perpetrated by her--from making fun of the size of my large breasts (she and her daughters are flat-chested), to my hair (always done), to taking other shots at me for no reason. I always was the bigger person and overlooked their behavior and I attempted to get closer to my MIL over the years by inviting her to events, buying her birthday and Christmas gifts, and trying to help her, otherwise.

Each time I invited her somewhere, she declined and she declined gifts. One lunch date she did not decline was months prior to me marrying her son and I think she only came along to tell me she was not going to marry us--she's a minister and she has married other family members. Neither my husband, nor I asked her to marry us, we already had it covered. Nevertheless, she bogarded at our wedding and had another minister relative to ""perform"" a ceremony at our reception without permission of me and my husband. It was very rude, but we did not say anything. I stopped speaking to my MIL 2 years ago when she uninvited my husband and I from a family trip to join other family out of town to visit a sick relative on my husband's side.

My MIL begged and commanded us for a year to purchase tickets to join family for this trip, but then she took it upon herself to uninvite us because her daughter said she did not want to be around her brother (my husband). These are all grown people, we are over 40, yet the mother told her son not to come. She did not even have the decency to face me. It was appalling for her to ask us to cancel tickets and hotel reservations made months prior to appease her daughter--we did not cancel, but instead showed up and had a mini vacation out of town and did not see any of my husband's family.

Now, my husband's father is very ill and had recently been hospitalized. My MIL has been emailing and texting for us to visit him in the hospital and do this and that for him. I never had an issue with my FIL and I did visit him in the hospital when I knew no one else would be there. My husband has a new job, so his time has been tight, but he has done what he could to visit and is considering options to help his mother care for his father at home. That is commendable as I had gone through that horrible stuff with my parents, but my family members are now deceased and I do not want to deal with my husband's family. In fact, I am planning vacations to enjoy my life and be happy without drama, instead of being there with my husband to look after his dad.

I (24f) and my fiancé (27m) are planning our wedding for late 2025. We are loving the planning process overall and everything has been wonderful. The problem arises when my mother comes into the picture. For context, I have always had a bit of a strained relationship with her, especially since her divorce with my Dad. But I have done my best to continue including her in my life out of a sense of obligation and pressure from family, however it has gotten to the point that I rarely reach out to her for anything, and she only reaches out to me when she needs something from me.

Now onto what caused the mess that I'm in. A few days ago, my fiancé and I ordered cupcakes to sample some flavors and get opinions on what everyone liked. I brought some over to my moms house so that we could have a tasting and talk about an upcoming dinner with my myself, my fiancé, his parents (who are still married), and my parents so that everyone could meet each other. After doing the initial tasting we talked and I made sure to emphasize the fact that my Dad would also be at this dinner so there weren't any surprises. She agreed that she would be able to come, and then she rushed me out the door.

Yesterday, she called me, and while we were on the phone I brought up the dinner to confirm everything and make sure she would be able to be there. She hurriedly told me that not only was she now unable to come to the dinner, but refused to attend any events that would include my father. She did not mention the wedding specifically, but it was heavily implied, and made some excuses about being busy and not being able to talk even though she was the one who called me. I was extremely upset at this and wrote some mildly scathing texts but ultimately deleted them all and have not had any contact with her since the call. I reached out to my brother to get his opinion on the situation, as he is much closer to her than I am, and he told me that she is going to be suing my Dad for child support of our younger sibling soon, so that may have contributed to her overall want for distance from my Dad.

After talking to my Dad and Adam (in separate conversations) about everything as a whole, both have decided to support me in whatever I do regarding her coming to the wedding, and I think I am just struggling this because this will be a huge milestone for me and I don't want her to miss out on something this big, but I also don't want to ruin the day for myself or my Dad by having her there.

I've met with my manager twice. I have been at this job for 2 days and below is the interactions I have had with my new manager.  
  
Day 1: I met with him twice, once in the morning and one before the end of the day. This was to check my access to certain systems and to give me some information on navigating them. My first meeting with the manager was a bit odd. Trying to be personable with him, I did not get much reciprocation.  
  
Day 2: The second day, I joined a meeting to validate access again. This was in the morning. I took the meeting in my office downstairs. To paint a bit of a picture, I keep the door to the office open to lightly monitor my 3 year old. It was just myself and my daughter, who was a room or two over, watching a video on my phone. I joined the meeting unmuted, said, 'Hello' and thought nothing more of the situation. About 20 seconds in, the manager mentioned that I was unmuted and asked me to mute myself; which I did. The rest of the meeting, I was on mute outside of when I needed to talk. After the meeting ended, the manager messaged me the following: ""\[9:17 AM\] Manager.:(Company) Nicholas.. Guy you should invest in noise cancelling headset.. Your background is still really loud and distracting.. ""   
  
Considering the situation, this came off to me as a bit rude or with a lack of self-awareness. Using ""guy"" after my name came across a bit unprofessional or overly casual, especially in a work setting and regarding a situation about being professional.

Granted, it is possible that the noise was more noticeable or distracting to him than to others, or perhaps he is more sensitive to background noise than others. However, addressing it after such a short period without offering a company resources or solutions, like recommending a specific headset or noise dampening software, came across premature.",Asshole,2024-07-29,"AITA - My first 2 days of a new job.

38,1ef90yk,AITA for blowing up at a guy who blocked my car in?,"
I feel like I was an AH for going off and getting loud with a guy who purposely blocked me in the spot I was in?

I was leaving a laboratory (health issues), and an elderly couple was right behind me. They happened to be parked directly next to me.

I realized they were waiting for me to pull out to get into their car. I had no idea how to get home from this lab I had never been to before so I needed more time. To let this elderly couple get in their car faster and not be stuck outside in the heat (93F), I pulled out half way, angled myself into the empty spot next to me, and pulled in quickly.

I was over the line into the spot I had previously been parked in. My main goal was once the other cars coming into the lot passed I would rearrange myself properly into the spot and sort out my GPS.

There were a ton of empty spots so I didn’t think it would be a big deal to move over like that for 30 seconds.

A guy reverses into my old spot. He is as close as possible to my car and there is no way I can get out. I didn’t understand what was happening. I just open mouth stared at him as he got out and walked away. I was so miffed.

It then hit me, this man was trying to punish me for my “poor parking”. It hurt a lot more than I expected.

I pulled out my notebook and planned to leave a note on his windshield. To explain what had happened.

After a while, he came up and got in his car. I quickly yelled “HEY!” He put down his window and I asked “Why did you do that? Why did you block me in like that?” I was definitely louder than I intended. He pointed out the window and yelled “You were parked way over the line! Learn to park!” I half sobbed out “I wasn’t actually parked! I had moved over so that the elderly couple in the spot next to me could get in their car! I was about to pull out and change my position when you pulled in!” He stared at me blankly. “I really wasn’t trying to take two spots, I was just trying to give them space! I was trying to do something nice! I go out of my way to help people. To think that someone who literally doesn’t know me, and treated me like I was an AH really hurt. You punished me for doing something nice for an elderly couple.” Again, I know it was like word vomit and was louder than I meant there was more but this was the gist. I was barely keeping my tears back. This guy was now looking scared and yelling “I’m sorry! I’m Sorry!” 

I ended up apologizing to him, that I know that there are a lot of people in the area who park poorly, but he was lashing out at the wrong person. I apologized about 5 more times for being loud and yelling at him, that he didn’t deserve that either. We parted ways, he took off quickly and I ended up crying in my car for blowing up like that.

So was I just a total AH for calling that man out? Was I an AH for getting upset/hurt about it? I’ll accept your judgement, but I feel like I was such an AH. 🥺

Edit: I was not parked crooked next to the elderly couple. He just needed to open his door all the way and there wasn’t quite enough room. I pulled half out because someone honked at me speeding into the lot, so I quickly pulled into the empty spot next to my spot to get out of the way. I was in Reverse while waiting for the other cars to pass by so I could park correctly. The last car stopped behind my car and reversed into my previous spot so close I couldn’t leave.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-29,"AITA for blowing up at a guy who blocked my car in?

40,1ef8ij1,AITA for telling my mom she’s setting up my sister for failure ,"

So I (17f) live at home with my mom (35f) who is currently 38 weeks pregnant,my sister (8f),and my dad (36m). When my mom gave birth to my sister I had to always assist her in any of my sister’s needs. Every day I make her all 3 meals plus her snacks, help her with homework, bathe her and do her laundry and clean her room. I wouldn’t mind helping my sister but the problem is that my sister can’t do anything for herself and it pisses me off since I feel it’s due to the fact my parents baby her too much while I had to grow up and learn to do stuff for my own from an early age. By the time I was my sister’s age I could make my own meals plus bathe and clean after myself. On the other hand I always gotta tell my sister when I’m going to shower her and I’ve tried to show her how to wash herself but she can barely even pour water over herself. She also can barely wash her own fruit and I have to always ask her if she wants something to eat when I feel she’s old enough to eat when she needs to without being reminded to. So recently I was speaking to my mom about changes once the baby is born and I asked if my sister would have to start being more independent. My mom told me I should still help her since she’s a “little girl “ still. I don’t know what came over me but I told my mom that her and my dad are the reason my sister will never learn how to fend for herself and that they baby her too much and are setting her up for failure. My mom started crying saying I am being too harsh and told my dad what I said when he got home and I got yelled at. So AITA?

41,1ef8bx4,"AITA - I yelled at my sister for her lack of planning and bad attitude, was I wrong?","This story happened over a week ago but I want to know everyone's thoughts on it.

My(f25) sister(f32) invited me and my mother(f60) to the Zoo in mid-June for an event in July. We made slightly complicated plans as this trip was a donor event and it would start directly after myself and my mother ended work. All the pickup times and that jazz was figured out ahead of time.

A week or so ago, the Zoo event was taking place and since it was a month later, we all forgot about it...*including my sister who had invited us*. She had set a notification on her phone an hour before the event started and was furiously texting us, seeing if we needed to change plans. My mom NEVER checks her phone while she's working and I had no clue what my sis was talking about. After ten minutes I finally piece together the reason why she's texting and finish my shift.

I text my sister ""we are at work right now"". Her response? ""That's funny because I recall you guys calling me during work before 😑"". I've only done that once and she is a contractor so unless she's in a client meeting she makes her own hours. Not saying that it's ok she gets disturbed but it rubbed me the wrong way because I have RARELY disturbed her during work hours. (and tbh she normally doesn't to me either)

I called my mom first to inform her of the situation, then I called my sister. Immediately she's very defensive on the call, blaming me for not putting the event on my calendar and why wasn't mom answering the text(she knows my mom never answers texts while working), etc.

I try to explain that we are working and she can't just accept that we can call her back at any time.(she only gave us the final hour of our shift to respond). I tell her that she needs to call mom and if she's gonna be so mad I don't want to spend any time with her at the Zoo. She was mad but I hung up on her so she could talk to mom and it ended up with neither my mom or me going. My sister ended up going with her friend.

We had seen my sister only two days before this blow-up at a family dinner, that's how I knew she forgot about this Zoo trip. She should've reminded us then, not an hour before we need to coordinate pickups and drop-offs.

My sister has a long history of anxiety and lashes out when stressed. She's the only one of us 4 siblings to have a bio kid so she gets away with a lot of rude behavior. She's otherwise very kind, but I really don't know how to address this situation because I wasn't being the bigger person and I was rude to her on the call as well.

43,1ef7j6d,AITA For guilting my husband into taking the kids boating ,"This past weekend my husband (38M) and I (36F) took our 3 kids (13, 11, & 8) to a cabin with another family for a 3-night weekend.  We arrived Thursday afternoon and stayed until yesterday just after lunch.  My husband and the other dad spent pretty much all day Friday and Saturday with the kids on the boat going tubing, skiing, and swimming.  I am not a fan of the water.  I am not a strong swimmer, I get motion sickness on boats, and I don't do any watersports.  So, the other mom and I stayed back and relaxed.  

We did some reading, yoga, played board games, gossiped, got everything ready for meals, etc.  I can't tell you the last time I had extended quiet time like that, it's been forever.  After everyone got back on Saturday, my husband mentioned that he and the other dad would like to either go fishing or golfing on Sunday morning.  My problem with that was that none of the kids enjoy either of those activities, so it would be just the 2 dads.  And with the amount of time that those activities would take, there wouldn't be enough time to do anything for the kids that day before we had to pack up and head home.

I told my husband that those are both things that he can do at any time and that we should prioritize what the kids want to do.  Of course, what the kids wanted to do was go back on the boat.  He told me that he's had the kids on the boat for 2 days straight while I've been sitting around doing nothing.  He said that he would like to do something for himself too since I've had basically 2 days to myself.  

I told him that it will be easier for me to get everything cleaned and organized before we leave if he and the kids are out of the house.  But, if he goes fishing or golfing, then I'm stuck with the kids and have to do all the cleaning and packing by myself.  Plus, then the kids are disappointed that they don't get to do what they want.  

He got upset and asked me why he is the only member of our family that doesn't get to do what he wants on this trip.  I told him that spending quality time with the kids like that is something he should want to do all the time and that these memories are priceless.  He got snarky with me and asked what memories I've been creating with the kids by staying on shore all weekend.  I snapped at him because he knows how I feel about water and that no one wants a motion-sick person on a boat all day.  I told him he can plan a fishing or golfing day for himself when we get home, but this trip should be about the kids.  He just said ""fine"" and didn't bring it up again.  

He and the other dad took the kids out boating again Sunday while the other mom and I cleaned and packed everything.  By the time they got back, all we had to do was get in the car and leave.  As we were getting ready to go, my husband handed me the car keys and told me I was driving.  Not asking, telling.  He said he was tired from being in the sun all weekend and since I didn't do anything, I can drive.

When she scheduled it, she told me that my father would handle the animals and I would not have to worry. However, if she’d chosen mid-August, I would be free to help.

I put a lot of effort into my dogs. Maybe because of this, one of my biggest pet peeves is irresponsible pet ownership.

My mom has two dogs, a Shih Tzu and a Yorkie. Neither dogs are house trained. She keeps diapers on them. They don’t even know how to sit. 

When the female, the Shih Tzu, came into heat I told my mom to keep them separate at all times, even when she is watching them because things happen very quickly. The dog is less than a year and a half so this is her first heat.

Something about her response made it seem like she wasn’t taking what I was saying seriously.. I had a feeling she wanted it to happen. I told her to please not to come to me for help if it did.

Well, as predicted she did not listen. She said she let them out together, went inside the house for a “second” and when she came out the dogs were already breeding and tied.

I told her it wasn’t too late, get the dog spayed immediately before puppies developed.

She did not and said she could not afford it.

Fast forward two months, the puppies have been born. They are four days old. The mom is sick and is no longer giving milk. The puppies need to be fed every couple of hours.

But my mom works 8 hours a day.

She is now asking that I help.

I told her no. I told her I warned her about this EXACT situation and it makes me pretty angry because it’s so irresponsible and entirely preventable. She says it was an accident but I firmly believe she wanted to have puppies so she could sell them.

I live over an hour away and while I’m home more than she is, it’s SUCH a huge undertaking!

Let’s say we’re talking about something we both like, suddenly she’s the expert and is all knowing about this topic. If I go to give my input it’s an immediate “shh” or “be quiet”. I don’t do this when she talks and I hate it. Yesterday we were watching the Olympics with our parents and other sisters, and we were both talking to our mother about Simone Biles I think. Whatever it is it had to do with the topic at hand, and yet when I went to speak she told me to hush. 

I told her to stop shushing me and said “well you’re doing too much.” And then kept talking over me. She talks over me, interrupts me, tells me to be quiet or takes over the story that I started telling. But she caught an attitude because I said stop shushing me. 

I don’t know what else to do because our parents never tell her to stop even though they see it happen all the time.

My grandfather doesn't like her and doesn't treat her kindly, he gives her unkind looks and doesn't answer her questions properly.

My grandmother is kind, but she is a tempered woman; she gets mad quickly and might yell at you.

50,1ef6tsl,AITA for crying after my grandmother got hurt?,"Yesterday, my mom, grandmother, younger brother, and I went sightseeing and took a ferry. On the way back, my grandmother tripped on her flip-flop and fell face-first onto the concrete floor. I was in a different area enjoying the view, and when I heard a loud smack, I turned around to see her on the ground. I panicked, thinking she might have had a medical issue, especially since I have generalized anxiety and panic disorder (since I was 12 & a long history of family trauma)

Everyone rushed to help, and my mom and I tried to assist my grandmother. Seeing her bloodied face made me cry, as I'm very sensitive and easily overwhelmed in high-stress situations. My shaky hands made it hard to open a water bottle, which frustrated my mom. She yelled at me to stop crying and calm down, but I was scared and seasick from the stress. There were 20 people watching. I didn’t know how serious her injuries were, and I worried she could have died. She’s 75 years old. 

I tried to stay composed, knowing that if I panicked, my grandmother might panic too. I turned away to manage my anxiety and helped my mom keep her stable. Watching the ocean helped ease my anguish. I held my grandmother's hand, cried silently, and prayed until EMS arrived.

As we walked to the ambulance, my mom stoped me in my tracks & sternly said “Listen. your feelings do NOT matter in this situation. You get it together & don’t worsen the situation for your grandma…you should’ve walked away”. I was shocked because I wasn't trying to draw attention to myself—I just wanted to help my grandmother. Despite my distress, I put her first and stayed by her side, making sure she was comfortable. She didn’t notice I was crying until my mom mentioned it.

Feeling helpless, I wished I could have prevented her fall. All I had were 2 bandaids in my purse. The situation reminded me of a traumatic event from my childhood when I witnessed my grandmother get hurt and couldn’t help her. This experience took me back to that day.

51,1ef6r13,WIBTA if I quit my childcare job?,"I (27F) babysit through the state and care for my friends 3 kids. Tate (9M), Lily (8F) & Kiley (4F). 

So background. I've been watching them since Tate was 6 and Lily was 5. Lately, it's honestly been a hazard to watch them. Tate has ADHD and anger issues, so when he blows up, he lashes out. Lily has started this behavior too, but particularly against Kiley. Tate's mom has him on meds, and sets chores up for the kids in the mornings that she needs me to get them to do. Most of the time during any of their blow ups, I have to get in-between the kids. They pick on Kiley the most, so she's a target a lot because she's smaller. 

The thing is, it's becoming a hazard. I'm getting injured, and being blamed for my friend's house not being clean, even if I tried to get the kids to do what was asked of them. I can't force them, and she's asked me not to do any cleaning, but if it's not done, I'm blamed regardless of if I told her I tried. And the cussing is even worse.

The kids lock me out of the house, laugh in my face, call me names, kick my car, lash out when I try to split up the fights. It's just terrible. 

I've been thinking of quitting. They don't even see me as an authority figure & their mom isn't helping to any capacity when she's telling them after I leave that she wants to fire me, regardless of if they're in earshot or not. They then throw it back in my face the next day. 

What do I do here? I'm so tired. I go home with so many bruises that my husband (27M) doesn't want me to continue. 

If it was anyone else's kids, I would have quit a long time ago. And I'm criminally underpaid by the state as well, which really does make me want to quit. 

I don't know what to do. I've tried talking to her and she just says she “can't get the house clean all by herself” no matter how hard I try to get the kids to listen.

Me (26) and my sister (25) are going to Taylor swift concert this weekend to Poland. I moved abroad 2 years ago and she still lives in our home country. All countries are in EU.

Our concert is on this Friday and we are staying til Sunday morning and then flying back home to our countries. I like Taylor swift but I am mainly going to the concert for my sister (I am not sure if I would go without her). Now she texted me that she is thinking about getting tickets for the same concert on Saturday (if the prices of additional tickets are okay)and asked me if I wanted to go. I said I feel like once is enough and that I would rather explore Warsaw together a bit. After a short conversation she decided to try to buy the tickets and go alone (and therefore leaving me alone in Warsaw).

No give a bit of a background we are finding our way to each other as we are not that super close and my whole family is complaining that I am selfish by moving abroad etc. So I was hoping to get some time with her as well.

Now I feel bad that I am letting her go alone in case of something bad happening etc. And thinking if I should just give in and go with her even though I really don’t want to go twice, plus my flight on Sunday is pretty early in the morning and I would be totally dead.

57,1ef5zhe,AITA for telling my friend his girl is unattractive indirectly?,"About a month ago, I (32M) had my middle school friend Mike (32M) and his girlfriend Jessica (30F) over for a canceled D&D game. I showed them a comedy YouTube channel I've followed for years. Last week, Mike and Jessica became huge fans of the channel and even got others in our group to watch it. During our weekly D&D meetup, our DM (28M) asked which girl cast member we'd date. Most picked a blonde cast member, including Jessica, who said, ""she's hot.""

When it was my turn, I chose a brunette cast member I thought would make a good gf . Mike, assuming I’d pick the blonde, because she apparently is just the obvious answer started pressing me for reasons. I mentioned that I don’t find blonde haired women attractive, to be clear it's not the only reason the list included I preferred the on screen personality of the Burnette. She seemed loving, caring and passionate and matching my own sense of humor. The main point for me though was the blonde girl was recently married and I feel weird crushing on celebrities I know are in a committed relationship. Having once been married myself.

That night, Mike texted me saying I hurt Jessica’s feelings because I called her unattractive. I told him Jessica is pretty and I'm sorry I hurt her feelings but of course I'm not attracted to her. She's his GF the blonde hair is just a personal preference i have. Went to sleep woke up to messages from Mike, the D&D group, and mutual friends. Mike had messaged everyone, claiming I called Jessica ugly because she’s blonde, which was not what I said. I called Mike to clarify, explaining that not finding a YouTuber attractive didn’t mean I think Jessica is ugly. A person can be pretty and you not be attracted to them. Mike then asked if I found Jessica attractive, and I replied, ""Why does that matter shes your GF Im not supposed to be"" I've always been kind to her and treated her with respect even joined in on the jokes the group would say about how she is out of his league. 

The last week has been like HS all over again. Texting people to clarify what was said. Rumors spreading, speculation, he said she said. We are all grown adults what the hell. I tried getting jessica's # to talk with her directly and appologize for missunderstanding. But all communication has been through Mike or a 3rd party 

Last night, no one showed up for D&D at my place like we have for 3 years; one of the guys texted me they went to Mike’s place instead. This week Mike was informing everyone both he and Jess were out of the group if I was still there. As well as Jess saying things about im just jealous because Mike got a hot girlfriend while I was ""alone with my hand and pictures of the girl he dated in HS"". I personally don't believe that was said by her. As she's never bee a mean sprited person. The whole group knows that girl was my wife who along with our 4yo child died in 2020. The dnd game was set up originally to help me with depression and cope with the grief. 
Whole thing is just so stupid I feel like im losing my mind. 


",Not the A-hole,2024-07-29,"AITA for telling my friend his girl is unattractive indirectly? About a month ago, I (32M) had my middle school friend Mike (32M) and his girlfriend Jessica (30F) over for a canceled D&D game. I showed them a comedy YouTube channel I've followed for years. Last week, Mike and Jessica became huge fans of the channel and even got others in our group to watch it. During our weekly D&D meetup, our DM (28M) asked which girl cast member we'd date. Most picked a blonde cast member, including Jessica, who said, ""she's hot.""

When it was my turn, I chose a brunette cast member I thought would make a good gf . Mike, assuming I’d pick the blonde, because she apparently is just the obvious answer started pressing me for reasons. I mentioned that I don’t find blonde haired women attractive, to be clear it's not the only reason the list included I preferred the on screen personality of the Burnette. She seemed loving, caring and passionate and matching my own sense of humor. The main point for me though was the blonde girl was recently married and I feel weird crushing on celebrities I know are in a committed relationship. Having once been married myself.

That night, Mike texted me saying I hurt Jessica’s feelings because I called her unattractive. I told him Jessica is pretty and I'm sorry I hurt her feelings but of course I'm not attracted to her. She's his GF the blonde hair is just a personal preference i have. Went to sleep woke up to messages from Mike, the D&D group, and mutual friends. Mike had messaged everyone, claiming I called Jessica ugly because she’s blonde, which was not what I said. I called Mike to clarify, explaining that not finding a YouTuber attractive didn’t mean I think Jessica is ugly. A person can be pretty and you not be attracted to them. Mike then asked if I found Jessica attractive, and I replied, ""Why does that matter shes your GF Im not supposed to be"" I've always been kind to her and treated her with respect even joined in on the jokes the group would say about how she is out of his league. 

The last week has been like HS all over again. Texting people to clarify what was said. Rumors spreading, speculation, he said she said. We are all grown adults what the hell. I tried getting jessica's # to talk with her directly and appologize for missunderstanding. But all communication has been through Mike or a 3rd party 

Last night, no one showed up for D&D at my place like we have for 3 years; one of the guys texted me they went to Mike’s place instead. This week Mike was informing everyone both he and Jess were out of the group if I was still there. As well as Jess saying things about im just jealous because Mike got a hot girlfriend while I was ""alone with my hand and pictures of the girl he dated in HS"". I personally don't believe that was said by her. As she's never bee a mean sprited person. The whole group knows that girl was my wife who along with our 4yo child died in 2020.

58,1ef5mer,AITA for not helping my elderly neighbor?,"We've lived in our house for 8 years and know most of our neighbors fairly well. 

One of our neighbors, who is elderly and lives with her adult son who helps her out at home when he's not at work, has on occasion asked me and my husband (and my brother-in-law who used to live with us) for help with things like carrying in her groceries or moving her car to the other side of the street. 

We've helped her many times with these little things over the years and usually haven't minded. After all, she's old, and it's a nice thing to do. 

But now we have two young children (5 years and 1.5 years), we both work full-time, and we just aren't able to help her whenever she asks. 

She never gives advance notice, and sometimes just walks over to our house or knocks on the door when she wants something. Often when she does this, I'm caring for my kids and I am unable to help. If I say no, she will try to persuade me, and if I continue to say no, she will become visibly upset. 

When I politely said hello to her at the recent neighborhood block party, she told me she was mad at me for not helping her more. I apologized and tried to explain that I'm really busy with work (I'm an elementary teacher) and my own children. She just shook her head. 

Just this morning, I pulled into my driveway after taking my kid to her swim lesson. The baby had fallen asleep in the car and I wanted him to stay asleep for his nap. 

My neighbor was waiting outside, and when she saw me she walked up to my car window and asked if I could give her a ride. I said no, I'm sorry, my kid needs lunch and my baby is napping. She kept pressing me... it's just down the street, the baby will stay sleeping, on and on. I was about to give in when she walked away, got into her own car and drove off.

Am I the asshole for saying I'm not available to help her? 
Obviously if it had been an emergency I would have found a way to help. But she just wanted a ride to a shop down the street. She can and does drive, and I've seen her call a cab before as well.

I've been thinking about maybe writing her and her son a letter to explain the situation more.

60,1ef5ejc,AITA for telling off my coworker?,"(All names mentioned have been changed)

So I(21F) work in a pretty decent sized office with a few people I work with regularly. I don't want to talk too much about my job, but our work doesn't take up too much time besides this bit of busywork we have to complete once a week. 

Last week I had what I assumed was a rather uneventful evening with my coworker Sam(19M) doing said busywork together, but ever since then he's been kind of unbearable. I tried cutting him some slack at first - he's known around the office for being lazy and he's not very well liked amongst his peers. It's very likely I'm the first to simply be nice, and I did listen to him talk about his interests while we grabbed our stuff. However, I have my limits.

My boss gave some of the younger workers my work phone number since I'm the most likely to be in, and he has been using it ever since then to text me nonsense. Every. Single. Day. Sometimes during his shift, or even a few times during meetings. He also does things that just blatantly make me uncomfortable - like talking about his sex life in cringe worthy detail. On top of that, he seriously doesn't respect my personal space. It's been less than 2 weeks and I've already lost count of the amount of times I've had to tell him to step back a few, keep his hands to himself, etc.

Yesterday was a bit of a last straw. Our boss called me into his office that morning to tell me he wouldn't be able to change my schedule this week due to some call outs. I told him I never asked him to change my schedule and he got very confused. Pulled a note from off his little corkboard that said to schedule us together more since we ""felt more productive together."" Both of our names were signed at the bottom.

I immediately told him that this wasn't the case, and, sensing that my mood was souring, my boss told me he wouldn't let this happen again and let me get back to work. When Sam came in later that day, I asked to speak with him in one of the meeting rooms. I told him I didn't want to speak to him nor work with him more than necessary because he makes me uncomfortable and ignores my boundaries. He apologized and said he'd do better, but I think I took it a touch too far when I said ""You won't because we're not friends. There's nothing for you to do better at.""

He's been pretty mopey ever since, and I noticed he's been put on projects that separate us entirely. There's also rumors he was very loudly reprimanded for some reason that no one can find out, but I left very soon after our conversation so I don't know if that's related or not(again, he's not very good at this job so it could be anything).

I don't regret standing up for myself - he took it way too far - but I'm not sure if that justifies my words. Am I the asshole for telling him off?





Edit: Some of you have expressed concerns about the way my boss(we'll call him Aiden) handled the situation. Aiden has always put the women in our office first, and made sure everyone feels comfortable and respected given we have a pretty diverse environment. After following up with him earlier today, he confessed that he had assumed it was a simple misunderstanding between us, and apologized for any perceived dismissal. Aiden has given me his full support. Sam has been suspended, and his continued employment will be based on whether HR finds any evidence of further harassment besides the forgery, which I am pleased(and a little peeved) to say I will have no trouble providing.

61,1ef5dmf,AITA for canceling on husband's family vacation?,"My SIL (41) booked a 3 bedroom Airbnb for the end of summer break and invited my husband (36) and I (34) to join.

We agreed to pay for the half of the Airbnb after she showed us pictures, etc. We asked questions and all seemed clear. We figured she'd probably be inviting her boyfriend and when we asked about the need for 3 bedrooms, she just said it was all that was available. Hey, whatever, right? Then, a few days later her boyfriend comes over for dinner with her and lets slip two other details previously left off. One was that his 6 year old daughter would be coming. We actually didn't care about this at all. We have met her and she's adorable. Then, however, he mentioned detail number 2: the third bedroom is actually just a small office space they threw bunk beds in and they planned on having my husband and I stay in it. We giggled and asked why we would take bunk beds when there were two bedrooms with queen mattresses. Apparently, because they wanted to give their 6 year old her own room and the closest one to their master suite was the other queen room. 

Husband and I were quiet and said nothing. It was obvious we were unhappy. SIL explained their reasoning and just said it wasn't a big deal.

Well, we mulled it over and decided it made no sense to pay half the air bnb cost for the room we were getting, let alone for the fact that we were staying in 1/3 occupied rooms. So we respectfully asked her to cancel, which it's early enough to still do, and even offered up the cancelation fee if for some reason they were still charged.

SIL is now angry and saying we are ruining 6 year old's vacation. I don't feel we are wrong. This is actually not the first time she's done something like this. Husband is kind of fluctuating back and forth on whether we should just suck it up, but I'm still unhappy with the arrangements.

The last bit I'll add last as it's significantly smaller. We both are pet owners. She has 2 large dogs and a small dog; we have 2 small dogs. Everyone said they were boarding the dogs. It is expensive to do so in Florida where we live. The boyfriend let slip they plan to bring their small dog along though as the boarding costs are crazy for them since it's only 2 dogs per kennel. I suppose I'm just feeling like the costs are mounting for us and the expectations are that we will suck it up and go along with every little demand, while they bend rule after rule in their favor.

Long story short, she's had a worrying few months, lots of scans, different meds, and a stay in hospital. Thankfully her meds are right now and she's almost back to the way she was pre-diagnosis (obviously, she'll never be fully back to the way she was - it'll be a new normal). During this time, she has been unable to get back to work. Her new diagnosis means she's entitled to certain disability benefits, and we are in the process of applying for these.

I made it very obvious that regardless of whether I work part time or full time, I would not be paying any more money to her than I already do.

Ive got back into the dating scene now and living with 2 guys who are always hanging around isnt great.

They said it isnt fair as they dont have any money saved up to replace the sofa, kitchen stuff, living room tv, dining room table, literally the entire house. I told them that they shouldnt be living pay check to pay check and throwing all of their money away every month.  I said that im entitled to move on with my life and they should know that this wouldnt be it for the rest of our lives, we wont be forever single and retiring together. 

I said i will give them a few months to put some money aside but i will be looking after this. They said that wasnt enough time. The property is more than affordable for 2 people, they both work full time and earn a decent wage.

65,1ef462d,AITA for not going on a second camping trip with my family to spend the weekend with my girlfriend instead?,"I (23M) go to school in the USA but had to come home to Canada to work for the summer. Since it is only about 4 hours to my US apartment where my girlfriend (30F) is staying, and I work 4 10-hour shifts, I have been going back every weekend to visit her.

My girlfriend is alone there after I moved her from her family who lives 12 hours away, so I promised to never skip two weekends in a row as I didn’t want her to be alone for that long. I told my parents about this promise too. At the beginning of the summer, there were two camping trips planned one weekend after another. I said I would do the first one since it had sentimental value and not the second (the previous year I did it the other way around).

Fast forward to now, this past weekend we had the first camping trip and it was great. Now my mom is trying to convince me to go on the second camping trip, suggesting I go Friday and leave for the US on Saturday. I was hesitant because I start a new co-op Monday morning and it would partially break my promise to my girlfriend. I said I would talk to her and see how we both feel about it.

When I told my girlfriend, she was super upset. She doesn’t like last-minute changes to plans and knows my family can be disorganized, so she worries I might not leave until Saturday night and have to drive the full 5 hours from the campsite in the dark. Or, I might be forced to leave Sunday morning, giving me no time before my job starts. My girlfriend also feels like my family isn’t considering her feelings since she misses me greatly and they have seen me plenty during the summer.

I honestly agree with a lot of her points. My mom is upset though because she wanted one more weekend with me before I leave for the States for a while (though I will be visiting and she is welcome anytime).

Now I don’t know what to do. Am I the asshole for not going on the second camping trip with my family to spend the weekend with my girlfriend instead?

TL;DR: I (23M) promised my girlfriend (30F) I'd visit her every weekend since she's alone in the US, but my mom wants me to go on a second consecutive weekend camping trip with the family. My girlfriend is upset about the last-minute change and potential issues with my new co-op job starting Monday. Mom is upset because she wants one more weekend with me.

67,1ef40qa,AITA for not inviting an acquaintance to outings/events?,"I(29F) have an acquaintance that I know from elementary school (31F). Her and I have never really been friends or close at all with each other (we never hang out one-on-one and we don’t know much detail about each other’s personal lives) but throughout our lives we have been around each other through mutual friends and acquaintances. There is nothing I dislike about her or any glaring red flags, but we just have never clicked or been close, it is what it is. 

Through social media I have noticed she has changed friend groups quite a bit, but this is also just an assumption through photos and posts and I don’t actually have any details here. She got married and had a family a few years ago and I get the sense that she is feeling quite lonely or maybe lost some friends along the way as she has been reaching out a lot lately to be invited to girls’ night out dinners, parties, events, concerts, etc with me. I don’t have a big group of friends but it’s been the same one I have had for 10-15+ years and we are all very try social and like to try new cocktail bars, restaurants, city events etc. I absolutely do not mind including more people and making new friends, but the way she asks is very odd, as she does not care to ever hang out with me. I’ll offer to go for coffee or a walk first, as like I said, I don’t really know her THAT well but would maybe like to before I invite her to a big night out with my all best friends. She always declines and only wants to be invited to the seemingly “fun” or “big nights” that we have. It feels very odd. What’s also hard is we will often have bought tickets already or have seats or plans to said event, so it’s tricky to include one more person at the last minute because then they wouldn’t be sitting with us or not in our VIP area with us. Anyways, the last few times she has asked, I have either said no or just didn’t reply. She will then often post cryptic messages on social media about how hard it feels to be left out or how everyone in her life has abandoned her, and it feels very much like she’s fishing for attention. On one hand, I feel bad, but on another, she has made no effort to actually be my friend and only wants to be involved in big social group settings/be invited to big/fun events. I should also say, I have a family too, and so do most of my friend group, so with the little free time we all have, i prioritize spending it with people in my life I love and care about me. I get that it’s tricky to make new friends, but I also don’t think I should feel obligated to invite this girl out all the time or help her make new friends? I also feel like as we don’t have a really history of friendship, I don’t owe her anything, and it’s not up to me to fix her lonelyness.

68,1ef3vk4,AITA for not giving up my grandma name?  ,"I (46)F have 3 kids. E (26M) L (22)F and J(19M). L is pregnant with her first child. I am over the moon as she is giving me my first granddaughter (E has 2 sons). 

My grandsons call me ‘Meemaw’, and have their entire lives. I chose Meemaw because my mom was a Meemaw to my children, and so was my grandma to me. It is a very special name to me and I cherish it deeply. 

However my daughter’s boyfriend, R (24M) mom, S (56) also likes the name…. because of the show Young Sheldon. S has expressed her love for the show, and how she’d love to be just like sheldon’s Meemaw. She has been dropping not so subtle hints she’d like to be called Meemaw since we found out my daughter was pregnant. Like “asking” the baby if she wants to call her Meemaw. 

On Friday morning she called me and invited me out to lunch. I said yes because I enjoy her company for the most part and had no plans.

When we got to the restaurant we were talking about anything and everything but the baby. We ordered and the topic of the baby didn’t come up until our food came out. In the middle of me taking a bite she muttered under her breath “give up being meemaw”. I was confused, and thought i her and asked her to repeat. and she said “You have 3 kids, you will have multiple chances to be a grandma. I only have one kid to have grandkids from and I want to be Meemaw to them”. 

I was shocked. I did not wanna give up the name especially because of how sentimental it was to me. After sitting in shock for a moment i responded “My two grandsons already call Meemaw, it’s too late to change it” I tried to laugh it off but she  she stayed stone cold and said “They don’t have to call you anything else, I just want R & L’s baby to call you something else” 

I then sit in silence again, not wanting to fight with her. she then followed up with a “so…” to which i responded “The name Meemaw goes back to my great grandmother and I have a lot of sentimental value behind the name, you can be Meemaw too but im not changing it” she rolled her eyes, then responded “I’m not sharing the name, it will be confusing for the baby” to which i stood up and said “Then I guess you’re gonna be looking for another name” then I slammed 20$ in cash on the table and walked out. 

I’ve been getting messages like crazy all weekend from my future son in laws side of the family, ranging from nicely asking to reconsider to calling me selfish for not giving the name up. My daughter is on my side, but it’s caused a big argument between her and her boyfriend and now she’s staying with me for the time being. I’m  starting to think i’m the AH , and for the sake of peace just letting it go, but what do you guys think? 

EDIT 1: After receiving a few comments I thought I’d give context as to why my daughter is now at my house instead of with her boyfriend. 

Her boyfriend is a major momma’s boy, he agrees with everything that woman says which has been extremely difficult for my daughter to deal with since the beginning of their relationship. Since my daughter was not taking S’s side on this situation she decided to come stay with us until R (in her words, not mine) “chills the eff out”. 

I also realized I referred to him and his family as “future in laws”. I say this because right before my daughter got pregnant he had asked for our blessing to propose, but since  has decided not to until after the baby is here. 

Thanks for the support and input and I will talk to my daughter, and husband and decide how we will move on from here! 

Update: Hi guys! Sorry for the late-ish update. I wanted to wait
until I could sit and write this with no interruptions. 

As much as I wanted this situation to end, it has not. I invited R, S & D over for
dinner. However it was just R & S (not sure why D wasn’t there but it’s okay). 

When I let them in there was no time wasted before a screaming match between R & my daughter broke out. 

My husband and my youngest son split them apart. Having my daughter in the living room  while R was taken to the garage. 

After that fire was put out S finally spoke up. “All of this because you can’t let go of being Meemaw?” she said. 

“I told you at the restaurant we could both be Meemaw, why are you acting like there can only be one?” I had asked. “I want a special name with my grandchildren, and I want it to be Meemaw” she said cutting me off  

“You are extremely entitled. You purposely cause drama everytime you feel R is drifting from you, you need to constantly be the center of attention no matter what.” I said. A few more things were said (that I honestly don’t remember) But at this point she had started crying. 

My heart broke for her. I am not a mean person, i’ve never purposely upset anyone and the fact I made her cry broke my heart. I went to comfort her; but she screamed at me to get away from her. She then got up, grabbed her keys and left. 

I had assumed R left with her, but he didn’t. He was in the garage with my husband until around 8 or so (they came over around 7) and when they both came back in, R went to speak to my daughter. I’m not sure what was said but my daughter left with him. 

As much as I want to let this go, i can’t. Anytime any drama happens with her, it’s always during a huge milestone with our childrens relationship. 

When they moved out of our homes and moved in together S made R give her a house key and would constantly barge in unannounced, and on a particular evening she saw something she shouldn’t have… then made a big deal about it. 

I just wish this pettiness would end. After reading so many of the comments I’ve realized it has absolutely nothing to do with the name.

69,1ef3jr4,AITA for inviting my stepsister to my wedding?,"I (25f) am getting married to my fiancé (26m) in December. 

He is my stepsister “Chloe”‘s ex-boyfriend. I know I’ll get flamed for that and I’m not even going to defend it. But the context is, Chloe and my fiancé got together when they were 16, and dated for a few weeks. He broke up with her and asked me out (I was 15 at the time). We have been together ever since. 

I could throw out a million excuses or mitigating factors but I won’t. It just boils down to…I cared about him more than I cared about Chloe (we were never close or considered each other family). I apologised to Chloe, and in the years before Chloe moved out I never brought my fiancé to our house. I never expected Chloe to forgive me and if I were her I probably wouldn’t have either. Chloe never spoke to me again beyond a greeting if we were in the same space. My fiancé and I moved away at 18 so apart from Christmas I never really see Chloe anymore. 

However, I did send her a courtesy invite to the wedding because I know it meant a lot to my stepdad that she be invited. I never expected her to come though I would have been fine if she did. I just put it out there. 

Instead, I get a message on Instagram from Chloe, reaming me out for inviting her because apparently I’m pressuring her to come. I said there’s no obligation on her side but she disagrees, saying that now I’ve put myself in the position to be the bigger person she looks bad if she doesn’t come (my stepdad and his family have been wanting her to drop the grudge for years and it’s caused issues). 

I don’t know what else I could have done. My friend said it was harsh to invite her but I think not inviting her would have been beyond rude, and it would have hurt my stepdad who is contributing a lot of money to the wedding. I’m not saying Chloe has to come or not come but I don’t think I’m the AH for reaching out and at least giving her the option considering her siblings, cousins, and dad will there.

I apologised to Chloe, and in the years before Chloe moved out I never brought my fiancé to our house. I never expected Chloe to forgive me and if I were her I probably wouldn’t have either. Chloe never spoke to me again beyond a greeting if we were in the same space. My fiancé and I moved away at 18 so apart from Christmas I never really see Chloe anymore. 

However, I did send her a courtesy invite to the wedding because I know it meant a lot to my stepdad that she be invited. I never expected her to come though I would have been fine if she did. I just put it out there. 

Instead, I get a message on Instagram from Chloe, reaming me out for inviting her because apparently I’m pressuring her to come. I said there’s no obligation on her side but she disagrees, saying that now I’ve put myself in the position to be the bigger person she looks bad if she doesn’t come (my stepdad and his family have been wanting her to drop the grudge for years and it’s caused issues). 

I don’t know what else I could have done. My friend said it was harsh to invite her but I think not inviting her would have been beyond rude, and it would have hurt my stepdad who is contributing a lot of money to the wedding. I’m not saying Chloe has to come or not come but I don’t think I’m the AH for reaching out and at least giving her the option considering her siblings, cousins, and dad will there.

Thank you all for your feedback, in my favour and not, either way it was very interesting so see how divisive the matter of wallets being sacred or not can be!

Peace and love, from OP ❤️



I (21f) and my boyfriend (22m) have been dating for 5 years. We do not live together as we study in different cities, but the plan is to move together next year. As I am on summer breakI have been staying with bf for about a month now, we have done prolonged stays many times now and never had issues- until today. 

Today is laundry day. In his apartment there is a shared laundromat downstairs which requires you to charge a laundry card using cash, then pay with the card. I remembered from last week that the laundry card is empty, but I didn’t have any banknotes in my wallet to charge the card.

BF was focussed on work with headphones on and hates to be disturbed, so I figured I’ll just check if he has cash in his wallet to save the long walk to the nearest ATM. I picked up his wallet and opened it, and saw he had cash. I was about to ask if I can take it to charge the card when he removed his headphones and snapped at me to put his wallet down. I thought he was pulling my leg as we frequently use each others bank cards to pay for things (just the other day I gave him my wallet to go to the store) so I smiled at him and tried to explain what I was doing. 

He told me to apologise for touching his belongings, and still not realising he’s serious, I gave him a sarcastic “sorry”. He scowled at me and said it’s extremely rude and disrespectful to touch somebody else’s wallet and when I again tried to explain myself he cut me off and said he expects a proper apology. I was a bit shocked, but said I’m sorry and didn’t realise it was a big deal. He said “well, it is” and put his headphones back on, then put the cash on the table and turned away from me. I left to do laundry and am currently sat outside wondering what just happened.

We share everything, and in five years together he’s never acted this way. I guess I just assumed that there isn’t really such a thing as mine or yours anymore, we use each others devices, bank cards, hell - we’ve even used the same toothbrush a few times. I want to bring it up and ask him to explain why this is where he draws the line, but first I want to check that I’m not the one being the asshole here. 

Reason why I might be the asshole: I have seen many couples use each other’s wallets before, my own parents and his parents included. I assumed that it is very normal in a long-term relationship (especially as we share money) but if other people agree that its a moral faux pas/ asshole behaviour I do not want to have a conversation with him about it where I would then be the asshole who does something wrong and tries to defend themselves.

So, am I the asshole here for touching my boyfriend’s wallet? 

EDIT TO ADD: A lot of people are using the comparison of him going through my purse. He goes through my purse almost daily and without permission, he is also allowed to touch my wallet and has done so before. He never asks to take something out of my purse and I am fine with that, that’s by I presumed me looking in his stuff is also ok.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-29,"AITA for touching my boyfriend’s wallet?

Thank you all for your feedback, in my favour and not, either way it was very interesting so see how divisive the matter of wallets being sacred or not can be!

Peace and love, from OP ❤️



I (21f) and my boyfriend (22m) have been dating for 5 years. We do not live together as we study in different cities, but the plan is to move together next year. As I am on summer breakI have been staying with bf for about a month now, we have done prolonged stays many times now and never had issues- until today. 

Today is laundry day. In his apartment there is a shared laundromat downstairs which requires you to charge a laundry card using cash, then pay with the card. I remembered from last week that the laundry card is empty, but I didn’t have any banknotes in my wallet to charge the card.

BF was focussed on work with headphones on and hates to be disturbed, so I figured I’ll just check if he has cash in his wallet to save the long walk to the nearest ATM. I picked up his wallet and opened it, and saw he had cash. I was about to ask if I can take it to charge the card when he removed his headphones and snapped at me to put his wallet down. I thought he was pulling my leg as we frequently use each others bank cards to pay for things (just the other day I gave him my wallet to go to the store) so I smiled at him and tried to explain what I was doing. 

He told me to apologise for touching his belongings, and still not realising he’s serious, I gave him a sarcastic “sorry”. He scowled at me and said it’s extremely rude and disrespectful to touch somebody else’s wallet and when I again tried to explain myself he cut me off and said he expects a proper apology. I was a bit shocked, but said I’m sorry and didn’t realise it was a big deal. He said “well, it is” and put his headphones back on, then put the cash on the table and turned away from me. I left to do laundry and am currently sat outside wondering what just happened.

We share everything, and in five years together he’s never acted this way. I guess I just assumed that there isn’t really such a thing as mine or yours anymore, we use each others devices, bank cards, hell - we’ve even used the same toothbrush a few times. I want to bring it up and ask him to explain why this is where he draws the line, but first I want to check that I’m not the one being the asshole here. 

Reason why I might be the asshole: I have seen many couples use each other’s wallets before, my own parents and his parents included. I assumed that it is very normal in a long-term relationship (especially as we share money) but if other people agree that its a moral faux pas/ asshole behaviour I do not want to have a conversation with him about it where I would then be the asshole who does something wrong and tries to defend themselves.

So, am I the asshole here for touching my boyfriend’s wallet? 

EDIT TO ADD: A lot of people are using the comparison of him going through my purse. He goes through my purse almost daily and without permission, he is also allowed to touch my wallet and has done so before. He never asks to take something out of my purse and I am fine with that, that’s by I presumed me looking in his stuff is also ok.",0.0,1.0373564958572388,1,0

My parents got married when they were both 20 and had my sister and brother pretty quickly after. They’ve always planned on just two kids, but they accidentally became pregnant with me when they were 38, making my sister and brother 16 and 15 years older than me respectively. My parents and family have constantly reminded me throughout my childhood up until now that I was the mistake in sly ways. My mom on few occasions had told me she wished she never had me because I ruined her body. Growing up, I was often compared to my sister and always reminded of how I paled in comparison to her. Relatives would often berate me about my appearance, especially acne which I have no control over. My aunt once told me it is a shame that I was born dark and how my parents were blessed to have one daughter with lighter skin. My own mother would say how much of a disappointment I am for not being as educationally gifted as my sister even though we both got A’s in high school and college. She has even told me that my degree wasn’t as useful as my sister’s even though our careers are in the same field. My father would avoid looking or speaking with me, but would constantly communicate with my other two siblings. He would only speak with me if he had an issue with what I was doing. Because of this, over the years, I have developed dislike towards her. I hate being near her, and I loathe seeing her. I would often evade her if she entered a room.

When I left for college, I really started enjoying life again and became more social. In general, I felt happier and freer and felt like I didn’t have to act so grumpy and depressed all the time like when I was at home. However, after I’ve graduated, I have come back home for the summer and have regressed back into that mentality. It also didn’t help that my sister was pregnant with her first child after suffering from infertility issues, and everyone around me constantly talked about how she looks radiant and beautiful. Earlier last week, she gave birth to a baby girl, and everyone has been visiting her at the hospital. I was able to weasel my way out of going when she was in labor, but now, everyone is pushing me to go, calling me rude and selfish if I don’t.

Our current place is smaller than where we lived before (because she feel the previous place is too old (2007 build) and we couldn't afford a large new home).

Yesterday, I spent the entire day working in the garage and basement from 7 AM to almost midnight while she took care of the closet.

Before bed, she showed off her work, which involved pushing most of the moving box into the closet and telling me she couldn't continue because there was no more room, which is false. We have two other empty closets in other rooms and leaving things in the box isn't the most efficient way of using the closet (ofc).

I was pretty triggered because it was a very lacklustre effort. I didn't ~~appraise~~ praise her for her work because I thought there were better ways to do what she did, so I started to open up the boxes and hang things on the rack.

We end up going into an hour-long argument instead of finishing the job on I never ~~appraise~~ praise her for anything (which is false), and I enforce my standard onto her when doing things (which is true, but I have to cuz otherwise, I will be living in a place that's inconvenient for me). I think she is expecting to get ~~appraised~~ praised for almost everything. She once asked for a praise ~~appraisal~~ when eating vegetables she didn't like. I know that was kind of a joke, but it felt very childish and often gets in the way when I have important things to do (washing dishes, in this case), and this repeats almost every day for nearly every little thing.

I know I am sometimes too focused on doing things and can get lost in tiny details for hours instead of enjoying the process, but **to me, a lacklustre effort is wasting time**.

We ended up leaving the conversation with her saying, she doesn't enjoy housework to begin with, which is why she wanted the ~~appraisal~~ praise even tho it's below my standard. I told her I would start doing all of the housework so we don't end up in this convo(argument) again because I really don't know how I could accept leaving most of our clothes in paper boxes.

I felt tired as I was already doing most of the housework. (Vavunming, dishes, cooking, laundry, taking out the trash, walking the dog, cleaning cat litter, etc.)

80,1ef08yg,AITA for not seeing my stepdad as my real dad and still want my absent’s father love and attention?,"Hi all. I 17f, have been living with my mom and my stepdad since i was 9. My mom and my biological father split up when i was 3, back in our home country. My father wasn’t completely absent, he paid child support and he came to see me once a week or two.

He’d usually take me to the mall and have lunch with me for a couple of hours. His way of showing me love was buying me food and toys i wanted.

He was quite a bad dad, he’d always joke around with me, i never heard loving words from him like “i love you”, only jokes i had to laugh at if i didn’t want to make the little time i spent with him awkward. He’d also threaten me with hitting me with a belt whenever i “misbehaved” (he never actually hit me, but those threats were quite scary for a 6 year old girl).
He was also very manipulative.

When my mom met my stepdad overseas, let’s call him Jason, they started a long distance relationship where he’d come to visit every 3 months.

Jason was loving and caring with me and my mom. He’d spoil us with flowers and clothes He gained my trust but kept with the same pattern as my father of buying me stuff to make me happy. He was still sweet and thoughtful thought. 

When my mom remarried we moved to Jason’s country with the condition i’d call my father weekly. I was the only child in Jason’s family, so they were excited about me, though i was already 9, so that was quite a disappointment for them.

Anyways, as the time went by i started calling him dad.
I called my father weekly, but as saw it as a task and it was a bit awkward. If i were to forgot calling him he’d scold me and make me feel bad. He never called me even once though. 

I loved being contrary and argumentative as a child, and that was a huge issue. I backtalked a lot, so it deteriorated my relationship with my mom, Jason and Jason’s parents. I felt incredibly lonely and helpless to the point i started hurting myself (slapping myself or digging my nails into my skin). I was 11-13 back then.

My relationship with my father got worse too, neither of us were interested so he proposed i only called once every 3 weeks. Those calls were tedious, but hearing him say that made me feel somehow unloved.

As i grew older Jason stopped buying me stuff, and considering that was the way i was used to be shown love, it made me feel even worse. However he still was a good dad and has always treated me like his daughter.

When i turned 15 my behavior and relationships improved greatly, specially with Jason, now behaving like an actual daughter. 
However, my mom and Jason fought a lot and said nasty things to each other from the very beginning, so i was in an unstable family in general. 

My mother used to talk to me about her problems and confessed to me that she stayed with Jason for his economic support, because that way i can have a better future. It made me feel incredibly guilty and resentful, as i was the main reason my mom stayed in a loveless marriage. 

I stopped calling my father, and he hasn’t reached to me since then. It’s been 2 years now.

My mom has encouraged me to cut ties with my father, and i’ve had to go along with it, because acknowledging him as my real dad would make my mom and Jason feel very sad, specially since Jason sees me as his real daughter.

I feel awful for feeling this way, i see Jason as my father figure, not my dad. i love him and I feel bad for not being able to see him as my real dad. 
I can’t deny i kinda miss my father, i want him to care about me, to tell me that he loves me even if he’s ignored me for years…. I already have a stepdad that’s worth millions, so i feel guilty and ungrateful for feeling like this.

82,1eezcb4,AITA for telling my parents they're hard to be near when they have a new baby?,"My parents have five kids already and told us a few weeks ago that they're having another kid. I'm their oldest at 17m. Then my siblings are 14f, 13f, 9m, 7f. I remember when my younger brother and youngest sister were born my parents were so awful to be around. They had the worst tempers and were just in a constant state of being grumpy and they snapped at us for everything. My maternal grandparents told me they were the same with all of us and they remember when they had my two sisters back to back, it was a nightmare and the first three to four years of them having a kid it's awful being around them. They admitted they distanced each time they had a new baby after my 14 year old sister because it was impossible to tolerate them constantly snapping at people and losing their temper.

When they told us they were expecting another kid I admit I didn't have a happy reaction or a positive one. I tried not to react but apparently my face gave away my unhappiness and they asked to speak to just me. They wanted to know why I was so sour about a new sibling and they scolded me for not being excited. I told them I wasn't looking forward to their temper when the next kid comes. They were like wtf do you mean and why make it sound so negative. I told them they were so hard to be near when my brother and youngest sister were born and I remember how I could just breathe and they'd be grumpy and angry with me. But I also know they were like that with the rest of us. I said it wasn't something I would ever look forward to.

My parents told me they have no idea where I get that idea from but it's not true. They ended up ranting to other family members afterward who all confirmed what I said. I heard them argue with a few of their siblings who said they had tried to help and got treated like shit by them. They said new parents need to be left alone not having people offer help. That they need calm and quiet and nobody bothering them. I heard them say it and I told them after their ramblings that having kids means you won't get the peace and calm and quiet they want and it's not the kids fault. I told them it doesn't mean you take all that anger out on a kid or anyone who just tries to help either.

They said I was still being a brat telling them they're hard to be around and no kid should speak to their parent that way.

They had the worst tempers and were just in a constant state of being grumpy and they snapped at us for everything. My maternal grandparents told me they were the same with all of us and they remember when they had my two sisters back to back, it was a nightmare and the first three to four years of them having a kid it's awful being around them. They admitted they distanced each time they had a new baby after my 14 year old sister because it was impossible to tolerate them constantly snapping at people and losing their temper.

When they told us they were expecting another kid I admit I didn't have a happy reaction or a positive one. I tried not to react but apparently my face gave away my unhappiness and they asked to speak to just me. They wanted to know why I was so sour about a new sibling and they scolded me for not being excited. I told them I wasn't looking forward to their temper when the next kid comes. They were like wtf do you mean and why make it sound so negative. I told them they were so hard to be near when my brother and youngest sister were born and I remember how I could just breathe and they'd be grumpy and angry with me. But I also know they were like that with the rest of us. I said it wasn't something I would ever look forward to.

My parents told me they have no idea where I get that idea from but it's not true. They ended up ranting to other family members afterward who all confirmed what I said. I heard them argue with a few of their siblings who said they had tried to help and got treated like shit by them. They said new parents need to be left alone not having people offer help. That they need calm and quiet and nobody bothering them. I heard them say it and I told them after their ramblings that having kids means you won't get the peace and calm and quiet they want and it's not the kids fault. I told them it doesn't mean you take all that anger out on a kid or anyone who just tries to help either.

They said I was still being a brat telling them they're hard to be around and no kid should speak to their parent that way.

83,1eeyym0,AITA For Not Inviting My Friend For My Birthday Knowing That He Can Get Stubborn And Bored Easily?,"So we were gonna have a pool party. Which is the pool at my house. So this friend, which is one of my best friends, just gets bored easily for some reason, even if he likes long car trips. He just seems like he gets bored of me. All of my other friends aren't really like that. I've invited him to my house a few times before, he gets bored after like 30 min. Even if we had video games. I don't know if this has to do with ADHD or whatever.


 Another example is when we went to a water park 2 years ago. It was a large one. Since there weren't long lines, we went on everything. But once we finishing going on everyone I asked him, if we can repeat some of the slides. He refuses to, saying they are now less trilling. I tell him that I've been doing what he wanted, why why can't he? Then he says that repeating the waterslides is ""boring"". He says he has MIGHT have ADHD. Then we drop him off to his house. He also doesn't text that much either, I don't know if it has to do with him not liking me or he has strict parents that don't let him use his phone much. He's still a good friend, but this happens sometimes.




It just feels like he doesn't like me much. We tease each other of course, but maybe me teasing him triggers him. I don't know. It's just he had this behavior since I made friends with him.

Whenever I go to her house we cook together too. She doesn't speak to our dad at all and she never met his wife or his stepkids.

He's just made so many mistakes and he only owns up to some of them. Some of them happened when our mom was sick, like disappearing for days at a time and leaving my sister to take over caring for me and for mom. Or like selling a lot of mom's stuff so we'd have more money in the direct aftermath of her death. Or when he invited a random woman into the house after mom's funeral and very clearly had sex with her while we were in the house and let the random woman wander around like she owned the place until the next day. He admitted to my sister that he cheated while mom was dying. I heard him confess to her. But stuff like that are dad's mistakes. He just didn't give any consideration to us.

My sister was like fuck this I'm out 8 years ago and she said even back then she'd never come back, which she hasn't.

I sometimes cook for myself. I eat at friends houses a lot too. So the other day I went out to grab some ingredients and made a pasta bake for myself and my dad's wife and her kids came home while I was eating.

I was like no, I don't wanna. She insisted it would be ""perfect"" and ""a sweet idea"". Dad didn't say anything. His wife's daughter said she really wanted me to teach her and got excited because she saw it as a done deal.

When I didn't give in my dad's wife told me I should pass on the big sibling knowledge of cooking and it's important that I take on an older sibling role with her kids instead of acting like we're strangers. I said we really are. I told her I already have a sister and I don't need another or a brother. I also told her it wasn't my job to be her kids big sibling.

She also talks to me endlessly about her visits with him, updates me on how he is etc. I've told her it makes me uncomfortable but she has explained that she needs someone to talk to about it as it's upsetting her and she has no one else to talk to.

A few years later, their mother took them and kept them away for two years. I can’t tell you how many times I cried myself to sleep. Finally, after a while, their mom permitted them to come see us again, and the bond persisted to this day. When they were 8 and 9, their mom let us get them for the summer and just never came back to get them. My brother got out of the army a year later and took custody of them. It was difficult for them at first because they didn’t really know their daddy.

Brother: “I know we got plans coming up soon with girls but I’m not sure on the dates yet and if you got cats still L won’t be able to stay over there. She’s not allowed to anyone’s if they got a cat. She gets bad and all swollen in her face.”
Me: “If I was to deep clean the house and keep the cats in one room the entire time she was here would you consider it? I will go through all the stops to make sure she doesn’t get exposed to the cats or any of their hair.”

91,1eewr09,AITA for working from home while my husband is off for the summer?,"Edit for more info: Should also have mentioned that the rooms upstairs are:
1. A small library with no desk space - my husband specifically wanted this as a library so I’m not allowed to change it. It’s a bit small for an office anyway as it has a built-in bed and no floor space.
2. The room we keep our house rabbits in, which has a sitting area in. I can’t work in there because rabbits + wires really don’t mix. This is a room we’re both happy with exactly the way it is, and it suits us and the buns.
3. The bedroom, which isn’t appropriate for work and I’d have to ask him to get up at the same time as me
4. The attic room aka recording studio. This would be perfect but he needs the space for the recording set up, plus it doesn’t have a door so isn’t private enough and I’m just about to enter the third trimester so getting up and down the ladder is going to be really uncomfortable (and not that safe!)

My employer knows about the current set up and is fine with it as he has the same kind of set up. We only have this issue for 6 weeks of the year and my husband knows the nature of my work. We’re a start up so we don’t have an official premises that I could go to. 

Original post: 

Trying to work out if pregnancy hormones have me all out of whack.

I (30F) usually work from home, and my husband (30M) is a teacher so has school holidays off. Last summer we lived in a different house with a dedicated office, whereas this year I’m working from the dining table in the living room. 

Up until now this hasn’t been a problem in the school holidays, as my husband typically only has one or two weeks off and wants to make the most of it outside or out with friends. If my husband wants to stay in during the day, there are some restrictions on when he can access the living room and therefore kitchen because I take calls that no one can overhear for part of the day. Unfortunately there are no other suitable rooms for me to work in - and to be honest I’m not sure I should be made to leave my usual work environment because of his working patterns…

This morning he’s already had a go at me about two unrelated issues and became really annoyed that he couldn’t come into the living space to empty the vacuum or use the dishwasher. He wants me to tell him when my calls are every morning so that he knows when he can’t enter, which is absolutely fine but a lot of my calls are unplanned and there’s only so much I can do about that. I feel like I’m being pushed out of my ‘office’, and while I’m really open to compromise and share my space, there are some restrictions I can’t really alter because of my job.

Probably worth noting that he has two full floors including his music studio to use, plus the entire rest of the world out of the front door, so I feel that using the living space for most of the day is kind of fair. He can of course do what he likes when I’m not on a call and during my lunch break. 

What do you think? AITA? Do I need to look into (expensive) co-working spaces to work in over the summer?

92,1eewp8v,AITA for not agreeing to represent our classmate who passed away?,"I (16F) am in year 11 and attend high school.



In each high school, the year twelves receive a varsity jacket, which you get to customise the name at the back, as to have something to remember your last year of highschool with. 



Unfortunately, in year 8, in the middle of COVID, one of our classmates passed away from bone cancer. It was totally unexpected, as no one was informed about it except for her family.



She was in my homeroom class, but due to the situation of COVID then and my city being in constant lockdown, I  have had maximum of 5 short interactions with her in the 2 years of highschool we had then.



She was really sweet girl, and if I had known about her situation prior, I would have definitely attempted to have talked to her more, even it was a “how are you?” I say this because the weeks leading up to her passing, I would see her alone reading.



I truly regret not talking to her then. I have never admitted this to anyone, as it truly pains me why I didn’t go up to her when I had the chance.



This year, her closest friend who is in the student council, proposed to add a cancer awareness symbol on one of the sleeves of the jacket, in memory of our classmate.



It just required student confirmation for it to be finalised. 



She sent out a google form asking for a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ if we wanted said symbol on our jackets.  She stated that only she would be able to view the responses.



I voted ‘no’, as it is quite a touchy subject for me. My father passed away from cancer when I was a child, and with the events of my life following his death, I prefer the topic not being discussed, so it just pains me whenever the mention of cancer comes up. So I know it would be a gruesome reminder for me to look at it everyday.



The following week she started giving me weird looks whenever I would see her by the lockers or when she was in class. It made me quite uncomfortable, as I never receive any attention from anyone, whether it be positive or negative. 



It bothered me quite a lot, so I messaged her through google chat, as an email for be too serious for a situation like this.



I asked if I did anything in particular that was bothering her, because clearly something was.



She responded, asking how ’I could be so selfish’, and that it is something that I ‘should not be bothered about’. She said that something so small should not even be a problem in the first place, and that I am not in the position to have such opinions. I only read her message. I wanted to give myself some time before I send something that I would regret.



In my head, I feel extremely sympathetic for what happened to her. However, I feel like it is just my opinion.



We got the link yesterday to purchase our jackets, and it obviously clear that majority wanted to have the symbol, so it was shown on the final jacket. 



Obviously I can’t do anything about it now, but I still think that the friend was being unreasonable, as it was asked by everyone for their opinion.

93,1eewfml,AITA for lying to my mom about money? ,"For context, my single uncle from my dad's side (so, his brother) just passed on and I'm getting a portion of what he left. It's going to help see me through grad school. While I'm glad I won't need to be in education debt, the whole funeral did take a toll on me the past few days and I have lots of thoughts in my mind about how I should've spent more time with him, etc. 

The first thing my mom asked was about my uncle's inheritance, not how I was coping. Since my uncle is single she knows it has to go to someone. I lied and said I didn't get it. I also said my dad didn't get it and that his late brother has chosen to give it to his other sibling. 

My mom has a history of gambling, drinking, and borrowing money from unethical places. She's the type that, I fear, if she knew we were given a portion of my late uncle's savings, the money would be gone in an instant. To give an example, I remember 10 years back she won $12k from the lottery and it was gone in a week because she stayed at fancy hotels, drank herself silly, and didn't want to come home. I was young at that time and needed my mother.

But now I feel this huge sense of guilt. All my life I've tried to live as honest as I can and not keep secrets from my parents. It's the way I was raised. I also know my mom is the way she is because of her financial situation, yet, I also would like for her to help herself and get a stable income as she's still very healthy. 

AITA for telling her I don't have the money? I love my mom and it hurts to lie straight at her face, knowing that this money might solve her problems and make her happy. Maybe she would quit drinking if she had wealth, but maybe she might become worse - I don't know. 

Tbh, I think she could tell I was lying. She looked a bit hurt. I'm not sure if I can carry this heavy burden forever since keeping an amount like this a secret feels very wrong. 

I'm not sure if this guilt of mine is healthy in the long run for me, too. I probably need to go to therapy, lol.

Just wish I didn't have to lie to someone I care about.

94,1eewbbn,AITA for playing videogames in my room at night?,"So, me (27m) and my brother (29m) live together. We both have our own room, the problem is that the electrical system is old and not very efficient. I usually like to play videogames during the night, and it's not a problem of noise as I used headphones, the problem resides in the fact that he sais his A/C doesn't work as my computer uses too much power. In his room he sleeps with his girlfriend and says it is too hot to sleep without A/C. He wants me to clarify that his room is very hot as it is exposed to the sunlight all day on two sides, it only has a window and it is not very thermically insulatwd, he weights 110kgs (240lb). 
So am I the asshole for wanting to do whatever I want in my room? Or should I just endlessly scroll through Instagram bc my stupid brother will scream and shout if i turn on the pc?
Another thing he wants me to add is that both of them (of course) produce heat as living creatures, he particularly produces a lot of heat and sweats a lot. He said he got a fever for the heat and that's the reason why he got the A/C. He says I could play any other time of the day, the thing he doesn't understand, is that maybe i don't want to, like, why should I play when he says that I should play?

Sorry for the weird flow of thoughts but my brother is shouting that I should dadd all these details, that in my opinion make him look way more stupid.

96,1eev5w6,AITA for not changing my sleep scheduel to fit my brothers needs? ,"I would like to start this post by saying that any accusations of misogyny against my dad will not be listened to. I, 16f, am the daughter of a extremely hard working man, 48m who works 5 days a week from 7am to at minimum 9pm to at max 3am. 

Because of his scheduel I am the main cook in my family, I don't expect my dad to come home after a at minimum 17 hour shift to cook dinner. I have 3 brothers, M18, M15 And M12. I am the cook not because I am the ""woman of the house"" or because I should stay in the kitchen and take over my mums role. I am the cook because my brothers are incompetent and I wouldn't trust them near an oven with a 10 foot pole. Sure they can work a toaster and a microwave but i'd prefer my brothers and dad to not eat microwaveable TV meals or cheese on toast for every meal. 

On the daily, I would make my brothers dinner around 4-5 pm then I would eat with my dad when he got home. My sleep scheduel has never been good, the knowledge of my dad getting home and eating a cold meal drove me insane so during most of my teen years my sleep scheduel usually involved an hour nap after school then staying up till 2am to eat with my dad then sleeping around 3am. I was perfectly happy with this scheduel and i always felt fully energised throughout the day even with less sleep than people say is needed. 

But recently I graduated school and I am in my last summer before college and I've been attempting to fix my sleep, my dad changed his work week by working less hours but one extra day to account for any lost hours so he's been home around 7-8pm most days so I've been getting to bed at 11 every day for a good while now. I feel great. 

Heres where we get to the issue. My brother, M18, gets alot of benefits from my dads work hours. He didn't go to college, lost his job a year ago and has spent almost every day since his job loss out drinking with friends or at parties. He says the reason is its his ""only way to cope with the job loss"" so we all accepted his behavour as his way of coping. 
But on alot of occasions, he has come home around 3-4am, waking me up to let him in then complained about not having a hot meal to ""sober him up"". 

He suggested the other day that if I would just go back to my old sleep scheduel and cooked him a hot meal once he gets home from his nights out it'd be great for his mental and physical health and would stop him from coming home drunk and making a mess by himself, therefore waking my Dad and brothers messing up everyone's nights. 

I found the suggestion obsurd but I'm not one for confrontation so I kinda just chuckled and brushed him off. Today, he came home at 6am, woke me to let him in then cried that he had had a horrible night and I was horrible for not making him something. I honestly was exhausted so I just told him to go to bed and took myself back to sleep. 

Around 4 hours later I woke up to my dad screaming from the kitchen and went down to make sure he was ok, only to find him shouting at out air fryer that was freshly put out from fire. Turned out my brother had put a large peice of raw chicken in the fryer with a can of peas and left it in the fryer on the highest setting for 4 hours and the only reason our house didn't burn down was my dads insane sense of smell. 

I feel like if I just did as he suggested and fixed my scheduel to feed him it would avoid any future situations like this. I feel this is all in my hands, I don't want my dad worrying and staying up to make him food, I don't expect my younger brothers to help, and im not exactly confident about my brothers intoxicated cooking skills-

He suggested the other day that if I would just go back to my old sleep scheduel and cooked him a hot meal once he gets home from his nights out it'd be great for his mental and physical health and would stop him from coming home drunk and making a mess by himself, therefore waking my Dad and brothers messing up everyone's nights. 

I found the suggestion obsurd but I'm not one for confrontation so I kinda just chuckled and brushed him off. Today, he came home at 6am, woke me to let him in then cried that he had had a horrible night and I was horrible for not making him something. I honestly was exhausted so I just told him to go to bed and took myself back to sleep. 

Around 4 hours later I woke up to my dad screaming from the kitchen and went down to make sure he was ok, only to find him shouting at out air fryer that was freshly put out from fire. Turned out my brother had put a large peice of raw chicken in the fryer with a can of peas and left it in the fryer on the highest setting for 4 hours and the only reason our house didn't burn down was my dads insane sense of smell. 

I feel like if I just did as he suggested and fixed my scheduel to feed him it would avoid any future situations like this. I feel this is all in my hands, I don't want my dad worrying and staying up to make him food, I don't expect my younger brothers to help, and im not exactly confident about my brothers intoxicated cooking skills-

97,1eeuxeg,AITA for not understanding my bf? ,"Im having issues with bf (8 months) which are triggering my anxiety.
I will post some of our fights and I need to know what you think 

- a coworker texts him, he’s only 5 months in this job and I had seen texts between them before, one day I see him texting her back and I ask: who’s this girl? (Normal tone) = he becomes “mad” and says she’s just a friend from work, and me asking is not normal. But I don’t think he’s cheating.

- from the beginning, most of the time he won’t tell me who or where he is meeting, even if it is a harmless meeting 

- We are going to travel to another continent and I was motivated, I ask him in a bar if he is and his answer: well I feel lazy about it = my face changes. He continues “you know, the suitcase and being far from home is a bit annoying” 

- I’m at his place, less than 24h and in the afternoon he says “well I think I’m going for a run” 
Then he says it’s too hot for the run = I say I’m going anyway because I feel he wants to be alone (I admit this was a passive aggressive comment from me but I felt kicked out). Then he admitted that he wanted to be alone and that I don’t make things easy for him by just leaving if I feel that.

He says I’m too sensitive and that he’s feeling less motivated to meet me but still wanting it.
He also adds that I should do more activities with friends at the weekend because he feels responsible of my weekends and feels bad if I don’t make plans (this is crazy because I keep seeing my friends whenever we can and we aren’t spending the whole weekend together and before he didn’t complain about all this). He just says I already knew he was solitary.

To sum up, he complains that I’m always wearing a long face around him and that it makes him distance from me. I don’t know how to reconnect with him

99,1eeuhds,AITA for letting my 3 months pregnant wife join her office and other staffs in outing to another city?,"I apologize in advance for my bad and likely unusual English, it's not my native language.

To put it simply, my 3 months pregnant wife asked my permission\* to go on an outing by her office together with other staffs to another city.

I literally thought about her being pregnant and kind of unsure, so I asked her for the details about the destination and what the activities are, and she said it was in another city around 2-3 hours drive with bus.  
There are some activities including rafting which is optional, and night BBQ, party, etc.

I thought it's fine if she's not doing any extreme activities and only partying, and also since staffs who don't join this event will have to go to work normally at the office (which I know she really hates, she often complains about her job),  
I told her it's fine if she wants to go.

She suddenly asked me what I'm going to do while she's gone, and I told her I'll just do the usual every time I'm home alone (I'm WFH while she's WFO so she's rarely home), working, playing games, sleep.  
I also tried being sweet by saying I'll miss her while she's gone.

Then she suddenly went cold by saying ""No need to miss me"" (she often says this when angry) which made me confused.

I asked her what's wrong, but she just gets angry and said that I don't care about her or her pregnancy, because if I do, I wouldn't have allowed, or at least asked her more questions.  
She also said that asking me permission was not her intention, she just wanted to see what my answer will be which really baffles me and made me think that it was a really stupid thing to ask, almost like stupid tests girls in social media do.

I was just trying to be a nice husband and let my wife have fun.  
She also often gets irritated easily (even easier when she's pregnant) which is why I don't ask her too many things since I thought she would've already thought about her pregnancy, and everything else.

Instead of anger, I just feel sad and confused, I feel like I'm being tested by her question, felt like my right to be truthful is being toyed with.  
It feels like I'm wrong for allowing her to have her own space and freedom.

Am I actually The Asshole?...

\*EDIT 1: To clarify, although we come from a culture where a wife should always ask for her husband's permission to go out, but I never enforce that kind of thing in our family, which has also been the problem in the past because I was always letting her do anything she wants (going out with her friends for example) for the same reason.

100,1eeudl4,AITA for ditching my best friend on her birthday?,"over the weekend it was my bsf’s birthday. the plan we had made earlier this week was for our entire friend group to get together and celebrate with some drinking then have her sleepover at my house where we would bake desserts and watch her favorite movies. 

the problem starts when our friends began getting busy. i let my bsf know that everyone else was busy and it would only be us and asked her what she would like to do to which she says i wanna get drunk. 

normally, this wouldn't be as issue, but my problem with this is that my bsf NEVER pays for alcohol. she commonly refuses to pay but still expects to be given a portion of whatever alcohol we possess at the time. now you might think, hey its her birthday just cut her some slack, but ive had this problem with her for months and quite frankly im fed up with it. 

along with this issue, i dont have any alcohol at the moment so i tell her and she quickly responds with oh ill just stay home then. this was upsetting because she was choosing to stay home instead of hang out with me just because i didnt have any alcohol for her. i reply only saying oh alright because i did not feel like insisting that we still hung out as she had just showed her true intentions with wanting to hang out with me. she responded saying no one can hang, plus that was the whole plan to get drunk and make brownies and shit, to which i replied saying yeah but that feels really shitty for me that you dont want to hang out with me because i dont have any alcohol for you. she said thats not the case, i just thought that was the whole plan and now none of that is happening, and i said yeah but you didnt even try to be like oh we can still hang out though, you just heard no alcohol and called it a night. 

while i was waiting for a reply, i was texting with our friend who was accompanied by a girl who does not like me, asking if she could tolerate me for the night to celebrate and they agreed. she came back saying ive had a shitty day, i didnt mean because theres no alcohol but because theres no plan like i thought but i cant take anymore drama i cant deal with this right now. when i received her reply, i told her that our friend and the girl were willing to hang out and she just said okay. 

past this point my friend had stopped responding and i was still feeling a bit upset from earlier so i did not put any effort into getting a response and settling plans. about 45 minutes after she had said okay, she returned and said “or not?” which i honestly ignored as i no longer had the energy to converse and was getting ready for bed. about 15 minutes after that text she came back and said “really dude on my birthday?"". i did not see this text as i had gone to bed but i have now spent the day wondering if it was a shitty thing for me to ignore her beforehand. i understand that i definitely couldve communicated with her, but i simply did not have the energy to.

104,1eettek,AITA for keeping a dog given to me by my ex after she had a change of heart?,"My ex went manic & ended up in the mental hospital. She was kicked out of her house & the hospital would only let someone local pick her up. She was picked up by her dealer, & given a place to stay before her parents let her move back. She asked me to take care of her dog until then. When she came for him, she willingly left him after seeing how happy he was with my family.

I blocked her everywhere except by phone. She kept asking me to ""lend"" her money. When I kept telling her no, she told me she was coming for him. It was a bluff, but I didn't appreciate the extortion attempt.

She emails me constantly as her only way of contact, & I finally blocked it. I checked my spam, as I do feel bad. She's had him since he was a puppy, for about 7 years. She really has no friends, & her last email to me read ""I’m in so much pain thinking about how I’ll never see him again. I woke up crying a few times and you’re literally ignoring me.""

I'm REALLY empathetic & easily manipulated emotionally. I supported her & gave her everything when I had nothing, & did things I wasn't proud of to keep her happy.

On my Birthday, I planned a small dinner with my family & her because I wanted something small/intimate. Throughout the night, everyone constantly asked me where she was. I had to embarrassingly make excuses for her. She then texted me that night, that she was breaking up with me. She then came to my house the next day for closure, & to say she was leaving me for her dealer. She then proceeded to go sleep with him the very next day, & the next 3 weeks, as if our long term, relationship meant nothing to her.

Reasons for keeping him:

1) He was malnourished; his ribs were showing...
2) I walk him twice a day. She'd NEVER walk him (honest). She wouldn't even take him out to pee/poop.
3) In her house, he has a little corner to live in, with newspapers for his pee/poop & a raggedy old bed. He only SOMETIMES spends nights in her room.
4) They don't feed him on a routine-basis. His diet consisted of her scraps.
5) I'm scared he'll live in depression & die young if I give him back.
6) I play with him daily. She would complain about not paying attention/playing with him A LOT, & would proceed to not do so.
7) Her parents HATE pets & yell/say the nastiest things to him daily, & leave him to his tiny corner all day. My parents love/spend time with him when I'm not home, which is almost every day. 
8) His legs are so weak, he can't really jump. ie. if he's on a couch, he's too scared to jump off, as if he's physically incapable. Meanwhile my super old (same size) dog can jump off higher levels.

I've grown attached, but I feel guilty for taking him from her. I feel like he hasn't been given the chance to live the life of a real dog, & I'm giving him that chance. Sure. He belongs to her & he's her only form of companionship, but she's a TERRIBLE pet owner.

6) I play with him daily. She would complain about not paying attention/playing with him A LOT, & would proceed to not do so.
7) Her parents HATE pets & yell/say the nastiest things to him daily, & leave him to his tiny corner all day. My parents love/spend time with him when I'm not home, which is almost every day. 
8) His legs are so weak, he can't really jump. ie. if he's on a couch, he's too scared to jump off, as if he's physically incapable. Meanwhile my super old (same size) dog can jump off higher levels.

I've grown attached, but I feel guilty for taking him from her. I feel like he hasn't been given the chance to live the life of a real dog, & I'm giving him that chance. Sure. He belongs to her & he's her only form of companionship, but she's a TERRIBLE pet owner.

105,1eetm4p,AITA for disapproving of my best friend’s/roommate’s new relationship?,"My bestfriend (23f), lets call her Sally, and I (23f) got an apartment together a couple of months ago. About a month ago, Sally meets a guy. Lets call him John. Heres the breakdown of John:
30 years old, unemployed, small time musician (talking like 400 monthly spotify listeners), no college/university education, no certifications, music endeavours are funded by his parents, lives at home (2 hours out of the city), extremely entitled, and overall just a bum. Spends his day hanging out with  friends or sleeping and goes out every weekend. Essentially acts like an 18 year old 
with no financial or social responsibilities. If he needs money he’ll ask his parents, and Sally has told me that they have funded the majority of his music career. The kicker is that he is also the brother of Sally’s boss. 

Since they met, John has been hanging around in the city sleeping at friend’s houses, but majority of the time he is at our apartment.  Im in a LD relationship (3 hour drive), so I’m out of town every other weekend and my girlfriend comes to visit the other weekends. Before Sally and I moved in with each other, it was established that my girlfriend would be around, and that in a few months she would be moving in for a new job in the city. Sally and my girlfriend get along very well, so she had no hesitation about any of it. Anytime my girlfriend is here, she also helps out with chores and cooking, and if its for an extended period of time (3 weeks has been the longest so far), she’ll pay a third of the groceries. When she officially moves she’ll pay a third of rent/utilities as well. 

Anyways, John has been staying at our apartment probably 5 days a week the past couple of weeks. Sally never asks me if it’s okay that he’s around, and when he is they usually are in the common areas so I just go to my room. I just am not a fan of the guy. As listed above, I have a couple major issues with John and I don’t really want to hang out with them in my downtime.

In a nutshell this guy really gets under my skin. Sally knows that I don’t like him/don’t approve of them being together. Sally is hardworking, self sufficient, about to graduate university, and just a great person in general. Granted, if we weren’t roommates, I probably wouldn’t care as much, but I would still be firm in the fact that she could do better. I’m considering asking that he pays his dues if he’s gonna be around this much, just like my own girlfriend does. A third for groceries? He eats a shit ton, and since we split groceries, I am essentially feeding this guy. For context, I work 2 jobs, in university, and I don’t get any financial support from family.

In my friendship, there were two girls, we’ll call them J, and N. I’d been friends with J for six years, but for four of the six, we hadn’t spoken, since the pandemic started around that time. I was introduced to N as one of J’s friends at the start of the school year, when we got back in touch.

Now, J’s a pretty friendly girl. She’s sensitive, but kind and never really gets angry with you. N is more quiet, but is still sweet and open if you know her. But because of J’s sensitive nature, arguments happened often. N and J would fight, and I’d be there, trying to keep the peace.

This was frequent. But it got worse when school started to draw to a close. Arguments started over what to wear for a choir concert, and that one of us wasn’t going outside for lunch because they were sick. Really minor stuff. And because it happened so often, N and J’s friendship was breaking.

I still wanted to be friends with each. Just because they can’t be friends, didn’t mean I couldn’t be, right? Except for the fact that whenever I’d hang out with one, they’d trash talk the other. My social skills were destroyed because of the pandemic, so I didn’t know what to say when that happened; so I searched my relationships with both of them for flaws and agreed whenever they brought it up, saying whatever flaw I’d thought of.

And it worked. Until midway through summer. N and J were still not friends, I was still talking crap with the other, and I’d thought I’d gotten away with it. Except for one day, when J messaged me and said N had texted her again, saying she was horrible and that I’d agreed with her. I immediately told J the truth, that it was to keep the peace so I could still be friends with them both, and J said, quote, “So you lied to me?” And, “Wow. You’re just a lying, backstabbing bitch.” “Never talk to me again, delete this number.” I was tired at this point. I’d tried my best, so I sent my farewells and deleted her contact.

108,1eet6v9,AITA for  going to the police for my neighbor because their 3yr old broke into the apartment and broke my stuff?,"Am I in the wrong for calling the police on my neighbor
Hello I really just need an outside opinion to see if what I did was wrong. On Friday my family was out most of the day we only came back to drop off some groceries and left right away because we were busy . When we arrived back home however the neighbors said they called the police because their 3yr old was missing and they said , police said as well that it looks like their 3yr old broke into our house because they found the child sleeping by the window on the inside with our cereal. 
 
We laughed it off because how in the world did that happen but when we went inside I found my Chromebook and Nintendo switch charger broken . I went to inform the neighbors that it was probably their 3yr old because as mentioned earlier we were not home and that cereal was in the room with the device.I told them and they said they will give me 50$ I told them it was fine when I left it charging. So I got someone who speaks their language to translate and as the person was explaining to them they started to argue they said there is no way a 3yr old could have done that and my computer was already broken (why they would say it was already broken is that remove the plastic part that covers the hinges so if someone who isn't familiar with these devices it would appear like some was wrong with it , that is what the older child that plays with my sibling told their parent because that what they saw and I said that to the child who plays with my sibling so they won't touch it. I use it for school which will be starting in a few weeks)this is what the person who translated said. 

This is where I'm conflicted should I have waited a little longer before going and try explaining again or did I do the right thing.
   I went to the police station because I sounded they didn't want to pay. At the station the price of the device and Nintendo switch charger were $300 total the Chromebook is $199.99 the shipping is 60-70$ because it's electronic and and they charger is $40 locally ( I don't live in America so it cost more to deliver) the police was able to get $200 and said I would have to sue to get the rest of it. But I feel bad because my sibling doesn't have her friends to play with and I'm going to school soon .
Sorry for any spelling mistakes 

Short version 
While my family wasn't home neighbor 3yr old broke into the apartment through to window (idk how that it possible the window a little high) they say, and then I found my laptop and Nintendo switch charger broken I explained to the neighbor what that it could have only been them because we were out  and it was fine this morning. This is where I'm conflicted should I have waited a little longer before going and try explaining again or did I do the right thing.
( I was able to get $200 out off the $300 that everything cost but I would have to sue to get the rest and it would take too long and might cost more money )

I got up to check to see if there was any damage and there was a black scratch on the bumper. The other sibling who hadn’t ridden off yet was there and I told him that the other had scratched the car and took off. They said they would go get them and come back, and a few minutes later they returned.

One of these individuals in particular, Ned, is someone who I considered my best friend until this happened.

Over the last few months I've met and started dating Alice. A few weeks ago, one of Alice's friends, Sonya, had a birthday party, and Ned, being my friend, came along as well. Later in the night, Ned starts grabbing up on Sonya's waist, caressing her (there may have been some ass in there; there is dispute on this topic), and asking her over and over to go on dates. When Sonya said she wanted to go to bed, Ned tried to stop her. Anyway, Sonya has a lot of trauma surrounding these kinds of things because of some violence she experienced in the past. So, the next day, she tells Alice about what happened and that it made her feel uncomfortable. I thought Ned should know about it, but Sonya said she was too afraid to bring it up to him. So, I tell him about it. I hear out his side of the story and I agree with it for the most part. He had no way of knowing, she seemed okay with it at the time, didn't say anything. Then he turns aggressive and calls me out for not having defended him when I very much did so to Alice (who is incredibly protective of Sonya). He identified me as part of a ""group"" with Sonya and Alice, which hurt me a lot because I thought of myself as their friends first and foremost. It felt like they were casting me out. Granted, I wasn't spending as much time with them since I met Alice, as she consumed most of my free time. Ned says he needed space from our ""group"" (meaning Sonya, Alice, and myself) and cuts us out of a group chat he made. I thought from that point on that he wanted nothing to do with me.

So recently I brought this up to Millie, and they hate me too now ig? Said that Sonya instigated it and that Ned was asexual and Sonya was invalidating Ned's sexuality by thinking he was making a sexual advance at all. Truth be told, I never knew that Ned was ace (according to M it's been common knowledge for like 2 years so I feel like kinda a shitty friend for not knowing), he had a bi flag up in his apartment so that's what I thought he was. For some reason I think it's really wrong to be blaming Sonya for all this, I can't get on board with that, and my continued association with Sonya and Alice, spending more time with them than Millie and Ned, seem to be the things that are causing them to be upset. Millie said that Me and Alice were shitty people and bad friends. That one stung, because it really cemented that I was getting cut off by that group, which has meant so much to me over the years.

At school we were part of this massive friendgroup and we were all loyal to each other, everyone in the friendgroup supported our relationship and really adored us as a couple.

Just recently i’ve felt as if i’ve been left out of many things since the breakup, the friendgroup has been hanging out and having sleepovers with eachother, and i get that it would be awkward if they invited me as- well- y’know. But they love to subtly run it in my face, how much fun they all had together and i’ve kinda gotten sick of it.

I’ve recently developed a crush on someone else in the friendgroup (not smart ik), and I told ONE person about it, but somehow the entire friendgroup at school found out (not her tho at the time) and started spreading it to more people despite the fact I told them i didn’t want it to be brought up.

Just last week i had a massive fight with the friendgroup about not only that crush situation, but also how they’ve been treating me the past, them treating me like I don’t exist, and feeling like how the friendgroup has sided with my ex after the breakup. That fight resulted in people removing me on snapchat, and holding grudges.

After the fight, i left everyone on opened and delivered, as I was pissed off. Nobody cared to reachout to me afterwards, but that was disrupted when my crush reached out. She wanted to tell me her perspective of the story, and it was genuinely really nice to hear it as it seemed like nobody understood me. She said she found out that she liked me, but didn’t think of me any different despite everything that had recently happened. 

I replied back to her, thanking her for her apology on behalf of the friendgroup. I apologised to the others and got added back on snapchat. But i stated that I was going to take some time away from the group for my own mental health.

Although everything was resolved, it still feels bitter at times. I do occasionally talk to them, but just haven’t been hanging out with them in person. Just last night, i got told that “i’ve changed” and that sentence kinda broke me. The new people i hang out with aren’t typically the people i’d be friends with, but they genuinely care about me and understand me based off their similar experiences. 

This wasn’t very detailed, so if you need more clarity, do ask. AITA?

112,1ees9pe,AITA for badmouthing my date’s friend?,"So I (24f) work at a cafeteria while I’m in nursing school. The cafeteria is in the first floor of a prestigious company and the people who work there make a lot of money. 

There is a guy, we’ll call him Ken, who asked me on a date. He’s cute, funny, kind, I was excited and I accepted. I’ve only ever seen him and his male friend come down to the cafeteria. We went out for coffee on Saturday. While we were talking about our jobs I made a comment about how frustrating my job is and how excited I am to finish school and begin my career as a nurse. He asked why my job is so frustrating and I explained to him an incident I had with someone who works in the building.

The incident in question happened on Thursday. I was at the register and my manager came up to me and quietly told me to make sure I double check one girl’s order who was sneaking things into her lunch box. When she came up I asked her to open her box and she refused at first, I told her I couldn’t cash her out until she showed me what was in her box. She threatened to walk out with her food and I told her I’d call security and have her banned if she did. She finally showed me her box and she had about $25-$30 worth of extra things in her box. I charged her for everything and she was incredibly rude and short with me, muttering to herself about people who have no future and who are jealous of people who were smart enough to go to college and make more than minimum wage. I didn’t respond and just waited for her to leave.

As I was telling Ken about this he gets this weird look on his face and he asks what she looked like, I describe her and he goes I know her, she works in my office. I said “really? I’m surprised, everyone I’ve met from your office is very nice. She came across very rude and entitled and judgmental.” He stared at me and it was quiet for a full thirty seconds before he said “that’s my friend you’re talking about.” And I said “what do you mean? She tried to steal and told me I have no future bc I caught her trying to steal” he cut me off before I finished my sentence and said “I’d appreciate it if you stop talking about my friend like that.” I was taken aback for a second and I told him then this date is over and I don’t need another date from him. I told him if he’s willing to stand up for someone like that he’s not the kind person I thought he was and I left. The next morning he came up my register and loudly said he was sorry but he didn’t think we had a future together. I laughed and said “isn’t that what I said to you after you defended your friend stealing from us?” He turned red and left. Now him and his friends glare at me when they walk by to go somewhere else to eat their lunch. 

I’m not sorry for what I said, I didn’t lie or say anything that was untrue. But I wonder if I should have backed down or changed the subject. When I told my sister about it she rolled her eyes at me and said I’m going to be single forever because I don’t know how to be nice to people.

119,1eer2jj,AITA for talking behind my roommates back about his girlfriend with our other roommates,"

I (20 M) live in an apartment with three other guys about my age. We all go to the same college and that’s how we met before we become roommates. After our freshmen year together we all decided to get an apartment off campus nearby and it’s a 4 bedroom 4 bath with a common room and kitchen space. 

One of the roommates has a girlfriend who he has over for days at a time. This would be fine as we all have our partners over occasionally and they spend the night but they are over almost every day of every week. We’ve had multiple talks with our roommate about it and how we are uncomfortable by it and he does nothing to try and resolve the issue.

Well the other night me and the other 2 roommates were in the kitchen talking about it and complaining about our roommate, the girlfriend, and the overall relationship. Apparently we suck at whispering and our roommate hear us and so did his girlfriend who was of course staying over. We woke up the next day to a message from him yelling at us about the previous night saying that we need to apologize to them both but we feel like we don’t need to as we were venting our frustrations in our own kitchen. Would love to know what everyone else thinks.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-29,"AITA for talking behind my roommates back about his girlfriend with our other roommates

120,1eeqy7k,AITA for asking to text before calling?,"I deal with pretty awful anxiety, OCD and ADHD - when my phone rings unexpectedly, it can make me anxious, or it interrupts something I’m doing, which then makes my anxiety spike. If I’m at work, grocery store, etc., I am typically listening to a podcast or brown noise to stay focused and relaxed. I used to keep my phone on do not disturb in these moments, but I wasn’t responding to anything at all at that point, so my compromise was to request a text first to give me a five minute heads up if he wants to call. If this doesn’t already mitigate the “need” for him to call me (because he just says it in a text), I can at least wrap up what I’m doing and step away to speak to him without getting startled or frustrated.

A little background info, my boyfriend tends to call to tell me he’s on the way, or to ask what I’m doing later, all things that can easily be conveyed via text. We live together, so it’s not like we don’t see each other often. He is also one of those people who will tell you the same thing he told you earlier just to talk. I love that he wants to speak with me randomly throughout the day, but he runs his own business from home, and I work in an office, so our days function quite differently.

He did well with texting before calling for several days, but it’s evolved into just calling me without texting, and just apologizing before even saying hello. I got frustrated today after he did it again, and when I went to reiterate why I asked this of him, he said I didn’t need to explain why, he knows, but he thinks it’s unnecessary and unreasonable. I am upset almost daily because it appears he’s ignoring how it might affect me and my day for the sake of his own convenience.

121,1eeqtzm,AITA for moving out of my friends house after the wedding?,"
I was honored to be asked to be the man of honor at my friend's wedding, as she didn't have any close friends to fill that role. I embraced the responsibilities, including dress shopping, planning her bachelorette party, and more. The wedding took place in Las Vegas, and since it was my first time flying, I was understandably nervous. As someone on the autism spectrum, loud noises can be overwhelming for me. However, I managed to cope, and we landed safely.

Once in Vegas, we arrived early and began exploring. I noticed the bride seemed a bit distant, which I attributed to pre-wedding nerves. When we got to the hotel, I faced challenges checking into my room because I didn’t have a credit card; the hotel wouldn’t accept my debit card. This added to my stress, but thankfully, the best man offered to put down the required deposit, and I gave him cash to cover it. I noticed an awkward look on the bride's face, but I brushed it off.

Later, I had arranged a special outing for the bachelorette party, including tickets to her favorite show and dinner reservations. When it was time to leave, I went to her room, but no one answered. I called her phone with no response and checked the best man’s room, thinking she might be there, but again, no one was home. I ended up searching the strip for five hours, hoping to find them. By the time I returned, the show had ended, and I missed our dinner reservation.

The next day, I woke up early to decorate my room with champagne and orange juice for everyone to enjoy while getting ready. However, nobody showed up. I later overheard the best man’s girlfriend telling me that the bride no longer wanted me as the man of honor, stating that she would take on the role of maid of honor herself. This news hit me hard, and I felt emotional. The best man’s girlfriend told me I was making it about myself, but I wanted to express my feelings about the bride's true sentiments toward her. Instead, I kept quiet and returned to my room to get dressed.

Despite my feelings, I acted as if everything was fine when I was asked to take photos since they hadn’t hired a photographer. I smiled and complied. The wedding itself went smoothly, but a week later, I decided to pack my things and move out without telling anyone. I received some hurtful messages from both brides, but I chose to ignore them. It was a difficult time, and I ended up moving back in with my parents, still feeling the pain of the experience.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-29,"AITA for moving out of my friends house after the wedding?

We're used to being frank and talking openly with each other. But she started saying stuff like we have all these problems because of ""villager type people in *insert our traditional clothing*"" ""these gross villager men"" etc

The problem is people in the demo she described include a lot of my husband's family. My husband has a difficult relationship with them and has complained about them to my parents during tough times. But he still loves them.     

She's made these comments in the past. I'd never said anything because I thought I was being too sensitive. She wasn't saying his family directly, she was speaking generally.

But one day my husband said does she realise that my family are some of the people she's talking about. I asked does that bother you and he said it made him feel awkward and a little bad. Nothing intense but a bit uncomfortable. 

So this time when she said it I WhatsApped her to stop shit talking these ""types"" of people because it's literally husband's family. I didn't say it out loud as I knew husband would be embarrassed. I thought she'd realise oops and say sorry, I won't say it again. Simple exchange that saves everyone feeling awkward and putting a spotlight on husband. Instead:

Mum: Is it good to police someone's words?

Me: Is it good to talk shit about someone's family? I mean that's rude and inconsiderate.

Mum: I think we shouldn't be so sensitive. His mom and sister aren't like that. Those are the people I can be sensitive about. A lot of my family is like that too. Can't be sensitive about extended family.

Me: Thats fine if you don't care how it comes off to husband.

Mum: I do care a lot about husband. But you can't be policing words around family 

Me: I just told you this is something that isn't nice to say in front of him. You have done it before, he's now mentioned it too. Now you think it's policing and are fine with saying it knowing how he feels?

I didn't respond. It felt childish. I showed my brother (26M) the messages and he said he will talk to her. He said he thinks it was rude but he wants more context from her.

She's been peeved with his family for how they've treated him so she may care even less about what she might indirectly say about them. Also, she technically agreed to stop shit talking, byeing ""very quiet""

131,1eep5cl,AITA for refusing to give up my room for my sister-in-law?,"My wife and I flew all the way across the globe (stationed overseas) to visit home and attend our sister-in-law's wedding. We're staying with our parents in law in their small house, and made the plan well ahead of time. SIL says she's staying with her and my wife's grandparents before flying home. OK, no conflicts here. 

Fast forward, SIL flies home too and brings her baby and dog. *I forgot to mention she flew home from across the country and her soon-husband was finishing up some classes back there. She says she'll be staying with us for a few days. Well, that turned into her planning to stay the entire time. Oh well, she said she was staying on the couch since we got here first and it was part of our plan.

Her baby had to sleep in a crib that took up quite a bit of space since, again, small house. Her dog also got into tussles with my PILs' dog because of ""dominance"" or whatever. She got increasingly frustrated with me specifically because I didn't immediately pick up on the quirks of living with their family.

I think the breaking point was met when my wife and I went to visit my sister and stayed overnight at her place. We came back to find she was in our bedroom and the baby crib was in there too. We just thought nothing of it, we weren't using the room that night. Later in the afternoon after the baby was awake and everyone was busy, I folded the baby's crib and set it aside in the living room since it was in the way. SIL I guess didn't like that, and immediately set it back up in our bedroom and then went up to PIL and said she has the baby and the dog and is entitled to the bedroom, and we need to go on the couch. PIL said nope; we had our plan and she didn't stick to her's, and we weren't obligated to give the room up.

The next morning, she was livid and yelling at our PIL saying we came out here for her wedding, she has the baby and the dog and we have nothing more than a backpack worth of stuff per person. PIL stuck to their guns and said no. She stormed out and finally moved over to the grandparents' place, just about removed me on all social media too.

Having grown up with younger siblings, I get it; babies are tough. Her dog is also still technically a puppy and doesn't understand he's not always in charge. On the other, my wife and I had a plan, and this isn't the first time my SIL has done this by-the-coattail planning and hates taking no for answer. Furthermore, my PIL both work two jobs, and the grandfather in all of this is seriously ill (which I think is why my SIL decided to stay with us, because the emotional charge paired with that).

So for a small explanation on why I was so devastated is that my family has a history of constantly leaving the older siblings to care for their younger siblings and never actually tending to their own baby like they should be doing. I also have very bad misophonia, so obnoxious crying triggers me very badly. My mom had also PROMISED that I would be her last kid.

134,1eep0l3,AITA for being jealous of my best friend?,"I am 16 years old, and my bestfriend is 17. I love her so dearly, she is my world, and I never want to lose her. But I am insanely jealous of her. For simplicity, we will call her “Casey”. 

Me and Casey are seniors in high school, and have been best friends since the 6th grade. She is my favorite person, I could never hate her, but I do envy her very strongly. When we entered high school, a certain guy one grade older than us caught my attention. We will call him “Jayden”. Jayden has graduated now, but we all still stay and touch and hangout because of the close-knit drama program that we are all (among other people) involved in. It is worth mentioning that Jayden is aromantic, meaning he rarely is attracted to others. When we were both freshmen, I told Casey about my crush on Jayden. She confessed that she also liked him, but neither of us ever thought anything would happen, because Jayden is obviously aromantic, popular, (we are not), and older than us. 

About 20 minutes ago Casey texted me, and she’s all excited about something. I asked her what she was so excited about, and she sent me like 10 screenshots. They were all screenshots of her and Jayden texting, and they were playfully flirting. I wasn’t too put off at first, because despite Jayden being aromantic, he is very playfully flirty with his friends. As I swiped through the photos, it became more and more apparent, and got to the point where Casey said “Jayden [last name], are you flirting with me?” Jayden says yes, but tells her he can stop. Casey says something along the lines of how she likes it, and Jayden says something like “Good, I didn’t want to stop, you’re too beautiful to stop.” The conversation keeps going, and he sends her a reel that’s like “You look beautiful today. I haven’t seen you, but I know you look beautiful, because you always look beautiful”. Stupid, cheesy, average-teenager flirting. He’s calling her hot, and talking about how he wants her, BLAH BLAH BLAH. 

I responded to Casey and I was just like “Wow!” Then I said (PARTLY as a joke) “I’m so jealous right now”. Casey laughed. She KNOWS how much of a thing I have for Jayden. I want her to be happy, and maybe I’m being selfish, but she gets everything I want. 

She’s in AP classes at school, she’s friendly and people just naturally want to be her friend (I have autism, and despite hiding it, I have a terrible time making friends and having people like me), and obviously she is much more beautiful than I am.

I know that I can’t assume that someone else is like me and would do the same as I would do. But it bothered me that she was friends with him as I would not be friends with someone I was sleeping with/ dated out of respect for my wife. She tells me they were friends before they had a brief relationship and it was brief and it ended well and they remained friends on Facebook from years prior. I’m an understanding guy with full trust in my wife so I didn’t think any more of it. As time progresses I’ve noticed that she’s friends with him on every form of social media I noticed today he popped up as a suggested friend on TikTok ans it said she was friends with him well she didn’t use TikTok prior to us being together so it can’t be chalked up as oh he was just in there from forever ago. I haven’t mentioned anything to her yet as she’s with my family outta town and I didn’t wanna ruin her time with them. She was recently scolding her sister for sleeping with friends and I said well you did she said who and I said Marcus to which she said we weren’t friends but that was the reason I was given as to why he’s on her Facebook still. Again I didn’t bring anything up. The kicker is my wife is a very honest person and I know that she’s not messing around with him or talking to him as this was like 11 years ago.

But it bothered me that she was friends with him as I would not be friends with someone I was sleeping with/ dated out of respect for my wife. She tells me they were friends before they had a brief relationship and it was brief and it ended well and they remained friends on Facebook from years prior. I’m an understanding guy with full trust in my wife so I didn’t think any more of it. As time progresses I’ve noticed that she’s friends with him on every form of social media I noticed today he popped up as a suggested friend on TikTok ans it said she was friends with him well she didn’t use TikTok prior to us being together so it can’t be chalked up as oh he was just in there from forever ago. I haven’t mentioned anything to her yet as she’s with my family outta town and I didn’t wanna ruin her time with them. She was recently scolding her sister for sleeping with friends and I said well you did she said who and I said Marcus to which she said we weren’t friends but that was the reason I was given as to why he’s on her Facebook still. Again I didn’t bring anything up. The kicker is my wife is a very honest person and I know that she’s not messing around with him or talking to him as this was like 11 years ago. But why keep him on all social media is it to reminisce? Is it to keep tabs on his life? Is he the one that got away? I keep questioning all this as he’s the only ex she has on any type of social media. AITAH for feeling disrespected by this? Am I thinking to far into? ,4.0,1.0264310836791992,1,0

138,1eeo75c,"AITA for ignoring my friend’s phone calls after she invited herself, her spouse, her children, and her friends to my home for an impromptu BBQ without my permission?","My friend is having a hard time with her spouse, and really needs someone to be there for her while they work through their issues. We only just recently reconnected after not speaking for 4 years. Now, every time she calls she asks me what I’m doing for the day or at that moment, and then invites herself, her family of 4, and some of her friends over to my house.

Example 1 for clarity: Friday was her spouse’s birthday. Monday she told me her plan was to take him to dinner. Then she calls me Friday morning asking me what I was doing. I told her I was just watching a movie on my couch. Then she says I know it’s last minute, but I want to come over and BBQ at your house. She said the kids could play together and we could hang out and have some drinks. I hesitated initially, and then told her that I didn’t really have a lot of meat here nor was my home “company ready.” She responded that she would grab some more food and do all of the cooking. Then I said okay. I cleaned up a little bit and then I received a second call. She excitedly told me that she invited her guy friend and he may bring a friend for me to talk to, AND a female friend of hers was also coming. I was so shocked that she was trying to throw a party not just come over and hangout with just her family like she implied during the first call. Her family already was 4 people that I was not expecting which would have made a total of 8 people including my own children. I have only met 2 of the 3 people she invited. She did not even ask if she could invite anyone else to my home or give out my address. Luckily, I got a call on the other line and told her I’d call back. 2 hours passed by and she called me repeatedly. I decided to text her that something came up and I can’t host a party for her husband. I did not receive a response. I waited another 2 hours and then called her to see how the BBQ party was going. She told me she didn’t even have the BBQ party. Like wtf? I asked her why she didn’t ask her friends to come to her apartment since she has her own BBQ grill and why didn’t she at least go out to dinner like she planned originally. She literally didn’t even answer the first question, but said she didn’t want to spend a lot of money going out to eat.

140,1eeny75,AITA for going to IKEA with my friend?,"I (29F) realized id never been to IKEA before so i wanted to go. I decided to ask my girlfriend (32F) if she wanted to go as a little date maybe . She said she couldnt because she had to work. I was a little upset about this because I work alot and I hardly get to see her (we dont live together) and she doordashes so she gets to choose her hours but it seems like shes always doing favors for her family so she ends up taking shifts when im off. So i said ""so, im going alone then?"" Thinking maybe she would say she could go on a different day that im off or at a certain time in the day but she instead replies ""i guess so:/"" 

I decide to instead ask one of my best friends  and her husband if they wanted to go. She lives 2 hours away but IKEA is right in the middle of us and she sometimes works in that area. She agreed and was really excited because shes moving to sweden in a few months and wanted to read all the swedish words to me. 

The day comes and we find out she has to work until 4 and it closes at 6 so we had to cancel for that day and her husband ended up texting me telling me she was crying because she hasnt seen me in so long and she was looking forward to hanging with me. So we end up rescheduling to the next day. 

I was talking to my girlfriend the day we had originally planned to go and she asked if she could hang out with me for an hour on that day and i tell her ""we are going kind of late im not sure when ill be home"" and she gets really angry at me slamming the car door. I ask if shes upset and she says that i didnt tell her i was going with other people and to ""have fun on our date with someone else""

This turns into us not talking for a little bit and then we finally sit down and discuss our feelings. I admitted i should have told her I invited a friend as soon as i did it and she said that it was fine. I told her i would try to ask them to do something else with me instead because she acted like she wouldnt go with me again since it wouldnt be my first time. She kept insisting the situation was fine and i should just go but i knew she was still upset.

I texted my friend and told her my situation saying i shouldnt have invited them on what was originally going to be a date but she still seemed very adamant on going to IKEA and we couldnt think of anywhere else to kill a few hours and not spend money. So i just decided to go.

The morning of my gf texts me like usual but she was being really short. I told her i was really sorry and that i felt like i was stuck between being a bad gf and a bad friend. I was so stressed out i was crying and saying how i wish id just get in a wreck on the way there so i didnt have to go. I absolutley lost it because i dont normally have emotional breakdowns like that. We end up fighting and she doesnt talk to me the rest of the day and i go spend time with my friends and have a pretty good day despite it but im wondering if i should have cancelled my plans and waited to go with her... am i the asshole?

141,1eeng5j,AITA for making fun of my friends' career choices?,"
I've been fortunate that my 3 closest friends are friends from highschool (we are all 29-30 at the moment).

My 3 friends are amazingly smart- particularly with their hands; 2 are electricians. One is a mechanic. They started on their trades right after highschool.

I went to college. Got my masters(because I like chemistry), and now chill at work at a materials research company.

Background:
 my friends like to poke fun at me
""You spent all that money on college and you don't make that much more than us""

""You were stuck in school for many more years than us""

But I brush it off and laugh along. It is true, after all. But I largely don't care because I'm not insecure about it. It was worth the extra school for me; my income ceiling in my career is quite high. I have relaxing work days in an air conditioned office. And I get to leave and show up to work whenever I want; my boss doesn't care as long as my projects are moving and I present great results. 

So I am happy, and have accepted the jokes with grace whenever they poke fun at my ""bad decisions"". We joke a lot in our group and poke fun at eachother all the time. 

Anyways, one day we four were in my yard chilling, one started complaining about their back in a jokey way. One quipped he wasnt sure if he'll be mobile in 30 years. Then he looked at me and said ""guess you don't have to worry about that sitting in your air conditioned office"" 

And I said, ""yea, I guess going to college was worth it for me, eh?""

They all got offended and call me a asshole.


I thought it was okay because.... they all have semi made fun of my job before in essentially the same manner. And I kept my mouth shut, accepted it was a joke, and moved along.

He ended up ignoring me after I left the house and when I came back he was sitting in his car. I texted him thanks for ignoring me and his response back was “I’m leaving.

Finally we came to an agreement he put us in a weird situation by telling her before telling me.  Oh she also played dumb about it when I told her he was no longer welcomed at the house. 

Well Amy then decided to get a tarantula without talking me about how I would feel about living with one. Proceeded to block me off of her story and on TikTok so she could make posts about it without me being aware it was living in our home.
