Hi, guys! I want to thank y'all for the input and advice on my last post. I have a small update regarding my last post and it is a good ending rather than an ugly one :D

I talked to Sarah and apologized for making it seem like she wasn't valid enough to be in my home and that she felt hurt about it. We talked about it and while Sarah still feels iffy and left out, we're still on good terms. Although she sometimes has her cold moments, I understand. I feel like later on we'll get past it and get over it",UPDATE,2024-07-30,"Update on ""AITA for hosting events outside of my house because of a service dog?""

1,1efg1et,WIBTA For asking my mom to change her tattoo that has a link to me?,"I'm not sure how this will go, but here goes nothing. It hasn't happened yet, so I want to know if it's a good idea. About a year ago, I came out as non-binary. My mom has a tattoo for each of her kids (me, my brother, and my five sisters) with our names on them. Mine doesn't technically have my deadname (let's say the old name was Kyle and the new name is Charlie). Instead of ""Kyle,"" it says ""Ky,"" which isn't too bad, but it's still connected to my old name in a way. I'm considering asking her to replace the ""K"" with a ""C."" This way, it would still be a nickname, but it wouldn't be linked to my old name. That way, if someone asked about it, she wouldn't have to deadname me.

On one hand my old name is her first born child‚Äôs name and that means alot to her aswell as it‚Äôs her body I shouldn‚Äôt get a say (that‚Äôs my people pleaser side) but on the other hand it‚Äôs my happiness, my life and if she decided to explain it to someone who didn‚Äôt know my old name the only explanation for why ‚ÄúK‚Äù is there is because Kyle is my old name

So, would i be the asshole?",POO Mode Activated üí©,2024-07-30,"WIBTA For asking my mom to change her tattoo that has a link to me? I'm not sure how this will go, but here goes nothing.

2,1effkpd,AITA for last minute canceling on my friend ,"To begin this story I have been friends with a girl named Lexi for about one year now. Beginning of May I went to Texas to attend my mom‚Äôs wedding, there was a major falling out situation that weighed really heavy on me and I decided to come back home. Furthermore, that same week/weekend I fell into a funk because I just hate that my family can‚Äôt get along and there is always some kind of issues. My friend had been continuously asking me to go out with her to a Pride event. I explained to her that I was in a funk and just wasn‚Äôt feeling too good mentally. After a few days passed, my husband and her convinced me that maybe getting out will help me. Deep down I knew it wasn‚Äôt good but I didn‚Äôt want to let anyone down. So I texted her saying that I would go to the pride event. I began to get ready trying to forget about my sadness but I seemed to feel worse as time went out. I couldn‚Äôt find an outfit that was flattering, I was beating myself up mentally, my body dysmorphia was at an all time high. I began to weep and cry really bad. I texted her and told her I had to cancel because I just was not in a good headspace. She said it was ok and gave me a small pep talk. Next day I texted her again apologizing because I truly felt so bad. Since then, it seems like I‚Äôm reach out way more than I should without her responding or being interested. I have invited her to a hangout and she said she would try to come and didn‚Äôt. We had scheduled a girl dinner and that was cancelled an hour before. Which is okay. We normally would talk everyday on and off with no expectation. Now it has been one week straight, since cancelled dinner she hasn‚Äôt responded to my text. It‚Äôs not normal in our friendship. AITA for not texting, do I wait for her to text? Was me canceling on her due to my personal issue really ruin our friendship?

He comes in gets some gas asked for some food, told him I can as he pumps gas I will make some fresh food for him, he comes in right as the food comes out the oven. He pays for his food takes 2 bites and then leaves the store comes back in after he moves his car closer to the store, then comes in to complain that they where dry.

4,1eff40v,AITA for expecting my roommate to help with the property taxes?,"So I (F23) moved into a house i inherited early last year with my boyfriend. My ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù NB(22) moved in with me a few months later bc they needed out of their living situation. Before they moved in we discussed the rent and ALL of us decided $400 a month was fair. My boyfriend took care of the bills and we sent our share to him. All was well and they got a job almost immediately. 

After about a month my friends job started cutting their hours due to the holidays and they weren‚Äôt able to pay the $400. We said no big deal! All we really need to make sure the bills are paid is $200 so they started paying that for another month before they were only working 5 hours a week. I covered their bills and told them not to worry about it for 2 months before I started getting stressed about money and told them they need to find a new job. They said they would talk to their managers to get more hours because they loved their job and didn‚Äôt want to leave. Fast forward it‚Äôs been another month, they scraped together the money to pay rent so I stopped pushing. Except the month after that I had to cover their bills again. 

During this time, I was also buying them anything they needed. Groceries, vapes, etc. 

Finally a few months ago they got a decent job! They make more than I do with overtime and we never renegotiated rent. My boyfriend is currently out of a job and the bill for the property taxes came in at the beginning of the month. I‚Äôm really struggling to pay bills rn and the property taxes are a big chunk of money. I asked my roommate when the bill came if they could help me out with the property taxes. I explained that I‚Äôm asking for less than a third of the total over 2 months as that seemed fair. They responded with ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know I‚Äôll have to see‚Äù and changed the subject. I‚Äôm asking for $200 extra a month for 2 months. 

Fast forward to this past Monday, I asked again bc the due date is coming up and they said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know I‚Äôll have to see when I get paid how much my paycheck is.‚Äù And again, changed the subject very quickly. So when they got paid I had to ask yet again and they said ‚Äúwell I can‚Äôt really because I‚Äôm trying to save money‚Äù and when I tried to argue that it‚Äôs a household bill they told me it‚Äôs not. They swear up and down that it‚Äôs not a bill bc if they were renting an apartment the landlord would have to pay the property taxes. 

I reminded them of all of the things i covered for them under the impression that they would do the same for me and told them that I think it‚Äôs only fair they pay less than a 3rd of the taxes for the property they also live on because it is in fact a bill and I‚Äôm not a landlord we‚Äôre friends living together. They stood their ground that it‚Äôs not a bill and they shouldn‚Äôt have to pay it and stormed off.
