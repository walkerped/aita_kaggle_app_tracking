Hi, guys! I want to thank y'all for the input and advice on my last post. I have a small update regarding my last post and it is a good ending rather than an ugly one :D

I talked to Sarah and apologized for making it seem like she wasn't valid enough to be in my home and that she felt hurt about it. We talked about it and while Sarah still feels iffy and left out, we're still on good terms. Although she sometimes has her cold moments, I understand. I feel like later on we'll get past it and get over it",UPDATE,2024-07-30,"Update on ""AITA for hosting events outside of my house because of a service dog?""

1,1efg1et,WIBTA For asking my mom to change her tattoo that has a link to me?,"I'm not sure how this will go, but here goes nothing. It hasn't happened yet, so I want to know if it's a good idea. About a year ago, I came out as non-binary. My mom has a tattoo for each of her kids (me, my brother, and my five sisters) with our names on them. Mine doesn't technically have my deadname (let's say the old name was Kyle and the new name is Charlie). Instead of ""Kyle,"" it says ""Ky,"" which isn't too bad, but it's still connected to my old name in a way. I'm considering asking her to replace the ""K"" with a ""C."" This way, it would still be a nickname, but it wouldn't be linked to my old name. That way, if someone asked about it, she wouldn't have to deadname me.

On one hand my old name is her first born child‚Äôs name and that means alot to her aswell as it‚Äôs her body I shouldn‚Äôt get a say (that‚Äôs my people pleaser side) but on the other hand it‚Äôs my happiness, my life and if she decided to explain it to someone who didn‚Äôt know my old name the only explanation for why ‚ÄúK‚Äù is there is because Kyle is my old name

2,1effkpd,AITA for last minute canceling on my friend ,"To begin this story I have been friends with a girl named Lexi for about one year now. Beginning of May I went to Texas to attend my mom‚Äôs wedding, there was a major falling out situation that weighed really heavy on me and I decided to come back home. Furthermore, that same week/weekend I fell into a funk because I just hate that my family can‚Äôt get along and there is always some kind of issues. My friend had been continuously asking me to go out with her to a Pride event. I explained to her that I was in a funk and just wasn‚Äôt feeling too good mentally. After a few days passed, my husband and her convinced me that maybe getting out will help me. Deep down I knew it wasn‚Äôt good but I didn‚Äôt want to let anyone down. So I texted her saying that I would go to the pride event. I began to get ready trying to forget about my sadness but I seemed to feel worse as time went out. I couldn‚Äôt find an outfit that was flattering, I was beating myself up mentally, my body dysmorphia was at an all time high. I began to weep and cry really bad. I texted her and told her I had to cancel because I just was not in a good headspace. She said it was ok and gave me a small pep talk. Next day I texted her again apologizing because I truly felt so bad. Since then, it seems like I‚Äôm reach out way more than I should without her responding or being interested. I have invited her to a hangout and she said she would try to come and didn‚Äôt. We had scheduled a girl dinner and that was cancelled an hour before. Which is okay. We normally would talk everyday on and off with no expectation. Now it has been one week straight, since cancelled dinner she hasn‚Äôt responded to my text. It‚Äôs not normal in our friendship. AITA for not texting, do I wait for her to text? Was me canceling on her due to my personal issue really ruin our friendship?

4,1eff40v,AITA for expecting my roommate to help with the property taxes?,"So I (F23) moved into a house i inherited early last year with my boyfriend. My ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù NB(22) moved in with me a few months later bc they needed out of their living situation. Before they moved in we discussed the rent and ALL of us decided $400 a month was fair. My boyfriend took care of the bills and we sent our share to him. All was well and they got a job almost immediately. 

After about a month my friends job started cutting their hours due to the holidays and they weren‚Äôt able to pay the $400. We said no big deal! All we really need to make sure the bills are paid is $200 so they started paying that for another month before they were only working 5 hours a week. I covered their bills and told them not to worry about it for 2 months before I started getting stressed about money and told them they need to find a new job. They said they would talk to their managers to get more hours because they loved their job and didn‚Äôt want to leave. Fast forward it‚Äôs been another month, they scraped together the money to pay rent so I stopped pushing. Except the month after that I had to cover their bills again. 

During this time, I was also buying them anything they needed. Groceries, vapes, etc. 

Finally a few months ago they got a decent job! They make more than I do with overtime and we never renegotiated rent. My boyfriend is currently out of a job and the bill for the property taxes came in at the beginning of the month. I‚Äôm really struggling to pay bills rn and the property taxes are a big chunk of money. I asked my roommate when the bill came if they could help me out with the property taxes. I explained that I‚Äôm asking for less than a third of the total over 2 months as that seemed fair. They responded with ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know I‚Äôll have to see‚Äù and changed the subject. I‚Äôm asking for $200 extra a month for 2 months. 

Fast forward to this past Monday, I asked again bc the due date is coming up and they said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know I‚Äôll have to see when I get paid how much my paycheck is.‚Äù And again, changed the subject very quickly. So when they got paid I had to ask yet again and they said ‚Äúwell I can‚Äôt really because I‚Äôm trying to save money‚Äù and when I tried to argue that it‚Äôs a household bill they told me it‚Äôs not. They swear up and down that it‚Äôs not a bill bc if they were renting an apartment the landlord would have to pay the property taxes. 

I reminded them of all of the things i covered for them under the impression that they would do the same for me and told them that I think it‚Äôs only fair they pay less than a 3rd of the taxes for the property they also live on because it is in fact a bill and I‚Äôm not a landlord we‚Äôre friends living together. They stood their ground that it‚Äôs not a bill and they shouldn‚Äôt have to pay it and stormed off.

5,1eg8pfq,AITA for deducting points from my friends at a quiz I host?,"I (28M) have just started hosting a pub quiz. I am in my third week of doing it and before then I have never hosted one before, although I have been to a few.

Since the second week, two friends of mine, Mary (28F) and Jeff (28m) have been coming along to support me and play the quiz. Last week, they did it with my girlfriend and their team won.

This morning, the day of the third week, the manager of the pub stressed to me to make sure that I clamp down on any possible cheating, so at the start of the third quiz I told everybody that If I saw any phones out during rounds that I would deduct points from that team. I ended up deducting points from 3 teams.

My friends had their phones out for the majority of the quiz, and not wanting to show favouritism, I deducted points from them. So as to not cause a scene, I didn't tell the teams I was deducting points, I just made a note and did it when adding up the scores.

My friends did not win this week, but had they not had points deducted they probably would have won or at least drew. When the quiz was over and I came over to talk to them they had a paper and pen out trying to figure out 'Where they went wrong' and it felt really awkward.

When I got home, I got a long message from Mary in our group chat saying that she thinks the quiz was rigged so I wouldn't show favouritism and that she is disappointed in me. That they came to support me and they shouldn't play if they don't have a chance of winning.

6,1eg8mwf,AITA for having my boyfriend stay over at a shared apartment ,"I (20f) lived in a shared apartment with two roommates, who are siblings and family friends of the landlord. We've known each other since high school and generally got along well. We agreed on house rules, including no large gatherings and notifying each other when friends visit.

One weekend, my boyfriend stayed over while my roommates were at their parents' house. They returned early and found his shoes at the door. They were livid and knocked repeatedly, waking us up. One roommate yelled at my boyfriend to leave, and the other called me, telling me never to come back. They claimed they felt unsafe and that he could mess with their belongings, despite being okay with another guy visiting before.

We discussed the issue and agreed no guys would stay over anymore. However, shortly after, they informed me they had a family emergency and needed to move out. The landlord said I had to either pay full rent or move out. They moved out immediately, and I eventually managed to stay for another 30 days, as per the contract.

Later, I noticed one roommate's location in Amsterdam, even though they mentioned a family emergency. A few weeks later, I saw their location back at the apartment. For the next couple of days, I kept an eye on their location to make sure they weren't just back to pick up belongings or visit.

Throughout the relationship I have footed all essential costs for them (Insurance, food etc). When we split, we agreed that as she was not able to take them with her and provide adequately for them, that I would continue to look after them until she had a space she could adequately care for them in. We agreed that she would send me the money to cover their expenses and upkeep whilst they were in my care. The first month came and went and no money was sent and my messages were ignored, another month later and still nothing was received and still my messages about their expenses were ignored and left on read.
 The relationship was 13yrs long and the split was rough on me, throughout this time the Rabbits became my emotional support and they genuinely helped me to continue on each day and they are my little buddies.
The Ex has made contact recently after several months asking what she can do to convince me to relinquish their ownership as she feels she now in a position to look after them.
Due to my connection with them and the fact that I have footed their expenses their entire lives I do not want to give them up. I have said that by not only failing to follow through with paying their expenses or even respond to contact asking for this, that she has lost any right to their ownership.
The boys are both healthy and well cared for and it would destroy me to lose them.

11,1eg7nk3,AITA for telling my husband's ex that I must have been the favorite girlfriend since he married me?,"Ok so my 40sF husband 40sM have been off and on since we were 12, broke up at 22, took a 17 year break and got together 3 years ago and have been married for a little over 2. He spent almost 3 years with an ex and they broke up about 10years ago.
  
The ex, who I will call Patty, and my husband Doug broke up on good terms and she will reach out here and there to say happy birthday, merry Christmas and she reached out when she heard we were getting married and gave us her congratulations. 

Saturday night we went to the local bar and she happened to be there and we all sat together drinking, talking and just hanging out. I was 3 jack and Cokes in and I can not remember how it got brought up but Patty at one point said ""Well at least I will always be your favorite girlfriend."" I laughed and said ""Wouldn't I be his favorite girlfriend since I'm the one he married?"" She stopped smiling and just looked at me. She finished her drink and let not long after that. 

Last night Doug got a long message from Patty saying she was really shocked at how jealous, immature,Petty and mean I am given my age and that I should be more secure in our marriage and in myself and that it's okay for Doug to care about others besides just me. She also told him how much him telling her she was his favorite girlfriend all those years ago had always meant to her and can't understand why I had to shit on it.

Doug told her he was sorry what I said upset her but that I was just saying a fact, I was the favorite girlfriend and that's a huge reason he married me. She sent back another long text saying I just think I'm better than her because Doug had a very firm stand that he would never marry, he didn't care if he had a gun to his head it wouldn't happen. When we reconnected this time he asked me to marry him after a month and we married after 8 and a half months. Doug told her that it wasn't true,I don't think I'm better than anyone and said again he was sorry she was hurt but that I said nothing wrong,told her the things she was saying about me aren't true and to be er speak about me like that again. 


I truly never in a million years would want to hurt anyone's feelings. I said I was his favorite because I feel like you marry your favorite person don't you? Why would you marry someone who isn't your favorite? So am I the asshole here? Doug told me it's not in anyway on me that she got hurt. My best friend said that I didn't say anything that wasn't true and thinks maybe Patty is going through some stuff or just went through a break up and is just taking it out on me.

E is still a Christian but was starting to become more progressive and even started therapy. My fianc√© didn‚Äôt grow up in that culture; he was raised ‚Äúworldly‚Äù as E was excommunicated when she was a late teen. He was raised Christian and is now a Catholic, a path he chose as a teen. When I met him, he was agnostic due to some life events that made him uncomfortable with his faith. I, however, am agnostic. My parents are religious, but I was never raised with religion. Despite my lack of belief, I encouraged him to reconnect with his faith and helped him work through religious trauma.

Anyway, when I came out as trans and my fianc√© as pansexual publicly, E had some questions but seemed calm and accepting. We thought it was a win. However, during a lunch about a month later, she suggested we shouldn‚Äôt get married because it wouldn‚Äôt be right in the eyes of God. This infuriated my fianc√©. They argued because our wedding is non-religious anyway and about my identity, making it an awkward lunch.

My fianc√© stood firm, saying he loves me and will marry me. He reiterated that marriage existed far before Christianity, and people of different faiths or no faith get married all the time.

17,1eg6fzg,AITA: Not Wanting to Continue Staying with Relatives,"I'm (41F) on an international vacation and currently staying with relatives. There are currently 5 people in the house, 3 adults (one 90+ yo) and 2 children (both under 5 yo and goes to daycare). I'm going to another city for a week and then returning. During my week away, their son/brother and his family of 3 (all over 18) will be returning from their international vacation to the same house. Upon my return, they planned for me to continue staying with them. Initially I'd agreed because it was only going to be the son/brother returning but now it's his entire family, which means one of the older children won't be able to use their bedroom since I'll be in it. This also means there will be 10 people in the house, with only 2 available bathrooms (there's another 2 bathrooms but they're ensuites to the 5 bedrooms). I'm also quite introverted so it's been very stressful and draining to stay with my relatives.

During my current stay, I've found black mold in the laundry machine, on the chopping board and dish sponge (I've mentioned it to them). I've tried to clean around the house but they don't have many cleaning supplies. Also they continue to leave the wet sponge in the sink. They have a weekly cleaning service who comes in but it's only surface cleaning at best. The house hasn't been taken care of very well (one bathroom doesn't have a working light so I use the currently empty bedroom ensuite bathroom at night), and the other bathroom usually smells of either urine, the sewer or mold. Some of them have been coughing for more than a week. I've found a swarm of ants in my bedroom. Although the home cooked meals are delicious, their food handling practices would not pass food safety inspections. I'm already experiencing more gastrointestinal issues than when I'm at home, but I've managed to go out to sightsee. But now I'm currently stuck in the house because I'm experiencing flu-like symptoms.

They have been really good to me for the past 1 1/2 weeks and taken me out on a few long driving trips, as well as refusing to let me pay for food. With the rise of COVID, I don't want to contract it again as I'm already experiencing long-term symptoms and may never recover. My cousin and his family are returning from a country which has a history of issues with air-borne illnesses. Getting everyone to constantly mask seems unreasonable since there's small children. Just the thought of constantly being around more people (whom I've never met) gives me anxiety.

Initially I'd agreed because it was only going to be the son/brother returning but now it's his entire family, which means one of the older children won't be able to use their bedroom since I'll be in it. This also means there will be 10 people in the house, with only 2 available bathrooms (there's another 2 bathrooms but they're ensuites to the 5 bedrooms). I'm also quite introverted so it's been very stressful and draining to stay with my relatives.

During my current stay, I've found black mold in the laundry machine, on the chopping board and dish sponge (I've mentioned it to them). I've tried to clean around the house but they don't have many cleaning supplies. Also they continue to leave the wet sponge in the sink. They have a weekly cleaning service who comes in but it's only surface cleaning at best. The house hasn't been taken care of very well (one bathroom doesn't have a working light so I use the currently empty bedroom ensuite bathroom at night), and the other bathroom usually smells of either urine, the sewer or mold. Some of them have been coughing for more than a week. I've found a swarm of ants in my bedroom. Although the home cooked meals are delicious, their food handling practices would not pass food safety inspections. I'm already experiencing more gastrointestinal issues than when I'm at home, but I've managed to go out to sightsee. But now I'm currently stuck in the house because I'm experiencing flu-like symptoms.

They have been really good to me for the past 1 1/2 weeks and taken me out on a few long driving trips, as well as refusing to let me pay for food. With the rise of COVID, I don't want to contract it again as I'm already experiencing long-term symptoms and may never recover. My cousin and his family are returning from a country which has a history of issues with air-borne illnesses. Getting everyone to constantly mask seems unreasonable since there's small children. Just the thought of constantly being around more people (whom I've never met) gives me anxiety.

AITA for wanting to stay elsewhere when I return from my side trip so I'll lessen my chances of getting sick again as well as having peace & quiet? I have another 3 weeks of vacation left and will be traveling to another country after I leave the current country I'm in.",4.0,0.018368447199463844,0,0

Also, hand washing dishes allows me to deal with them immediately instead of waiting around for a dishwasher cycle and having dried food stuck on plates in the meantime.

20,1eg624k,AITA for not caring that I was uninvited to my older brother‚Äôs wedding,"
This whole thing is so weird. I, (27M), am gay. I came out at 16 and my parents told me they would always love me, but to not mention it to my older brother who I'll call Brick, (then 19M, 30M now). When I was confused and asked why, they said that Brick had expressed some awful opinions about gay people. I limited talking to Brick until I moved out at 18, which wasn't much of a problem because we were never close.

I went to uni, got good job, and an awesome boyfriend (28M), in my home city. Me and my boyfriend Angel live a peaceful life. Peaceful until a few days ago when I got a call from my brother. I was concerned that Brick was calling me, as we have never messaged before, just had each other's numbers for emergency purposes. I picked up because maybe there was some emergency happening.

He opened the call with an annoyed ""hey man"" and I knew something was up. He said he was getting married to his fiance Yen (24F) next year. I didn't even know he had a girlfriend! I was like ""that's great Brick!"" and asked some boring wedding things that he begrudgingly answered. He then told me invites were being sent out in a couple weeks, and that I could bring a plus one. Here's where I made the mistake that started this mess. Without thinking like an idiot, I said, ""cool, I'll bring my boyfriend."" Major. Mess up. Brick immediately started yelling insults down the line, screaming that he ""wouldn't have an [f slur] at his wedding."" I didn't say anything and just hung up. I was rattled by hearing those words from my own brother's mouth, even though I knew his feelings about people like me. I told Angel, and he comforted me, ordering in my favourite restaurant and watching movies with me, which was awesome. We went to bed later and I felt alright the next day.

I sent my parents a message that Brick invited me and uninvited me from his wedding pretty much in the same breath, and went on my way to work, not a clue of the crapstorm waiting for me when I got off. When I turned my phone on again after my shift, it was blowing UP. Messages and calls from my parents and relatives galore asking me what the f happened? I phoned my parents back when I got home and gave them the run down of what happened, and said I honestly didn't care because it's not like Brick would be coming to my wedding anyways. My parents immediately chastised me for my ""obvious disinterest and disregard of my brother's life"" and told me I should be apologizing to HIM for bringing my personal life into his wedding. WHAT? I basically told my parents to screw off and have been getting bombarded with messages from relatives to apologize to my brother and get my invite reinstated, and apologize to my parents for disrespecting them, but I really don't want to.

I know from the title it will sound like I am the A-hole, but just let me explain. I (28f) and my boyfriend (33m) who we'll call T are long distance (important detail) and had a petty argument on Friday. I recently have started a new job with my local ambulance service and have been EXTREMELY tired. I went from working overnights to having to be at work at 5 AM and work 12 hours. I am not a morning person and tend to stay groggy for a while. While he was still trying to drag out this petty disagreement I stated that I was already tired and was starting to get irritated and would talk to him later. I'm very emotionally aware and know that when I get into a mood I tend to lash out so I try to remove myself until I'm in a better headspace. When I got home, I immediately fell asleep. To give you an example of the exhaustion, I fell asleep in the clothing I wore to work and my work bag sitting on the edge of my bed still. Thankfully I had set alarms because I didn't wake up until the next morning. The entire day I tried to call and text T but got no response. The next day, Sunday, I did the same and got no response as well. I even texted him that I didn't know if I should be worried or mad. This morning T decides to text me and say ""Are you still irritated?"" Admittedly, my first feeling was rage, then it was relief before it went back to rage. After I texted to say I'm glad he's not dead, he pretty much admits to ignoring me for two days because I ""ignored"" him. I told him that if he bothered to answer my texts or calls, that would have given him the why of why I didn't, and proceeded to tell him why. T then said that I have no right to be upset when I ignored him for the rest of the day. At this point, I was extremely upset and told him there's a difference between unintentionally ignoring someone due to circumstance versus intentionally ignoring someone because of what you thought happened. I then proceeded to explain that it's the principle of what he did because he actively ignored me, whereas I didn't do it on purpose and immediately tried to contact him the next morning. I even went as far as to say there has never, and I mean NEVER, been a time he hasn't heard from me in more than 24 hours. I told him that being long distance is already tough and the only thing we really have is communication and that's how he wants to handle his feelings?

I have a friend group consisting of 8 of us, one girl, let's call her ""Beach"", lives in a boarding school in another city and we only see her during the summer, the others are all close to me. The problem arose when I went on a mini vacation with my aunt and uncle last weeknd, I had a great time there and I couldn't wait to come hang out with my friends. However as soon as i got back from vacation i noticed that since ‚ÄúBeach‚Äù got back from boarding school two of my close friends  (Let's call them Treash and Nicey)have been constantly hanging out with her.

Of course they pretended as if they didn't know what the problem was (even though they did because I let them know that it was bothering me n others 2 days ago). When I explained the problem to them, they pretended as if I told them earlier that day""I can't go out/how I don't like to go out early/how they know that I would refuse them if they asked, etc.."" I was fed up with it when they ran out of excuses and when they finally admitted ""Us 3 like hanging out alone  "" So I cursed them and told them to never come back to my fucking house and to get out before I call the police because if they like hanging out alone  then get out of my house and go hang out her.""Goody""  was the only one who realized their mistake and apologized immediately.

",Asshole,2024-07-30,"AITA for kicking my friends out of my house and threatening to call the police? So for starters a little background( dis happened js now and im kind of mad so i hope u dont mind bad english)

I have a friend group consisting of 8 of us, one girl, let's call her ""Beach"", lives in a boarding school in another city and we only see her during the summer, the others are all close to me. The problem arose when I went on a mini vacation with my aunt and uncle last weeknd, I had a great time there and I couldn't wait to come hang out with my friends. However as soon as i got back from vacation i noticed that since ‚ÄúBeach‚Äù got back from boarding school two of my close friends  (Let's call them Treash and Nicey)have been constantly hanging out with her.

Whilst I loathed the idea of having to speak to her, the fact of the matter is that we could not afford a solicitor when he was in the midst of speaking to one. I thought that if we could see his little girl and also afford to pay the bills, it would be a win-win, even if I was uncomfortable by the arrangement HIS EX had suggested. My fianc√© is currently arranging court proceedings as his daughter deserves to see her dad.

I‚Äôm (25F) engaged to my fianc√© (23M) who has a young daughter from his previous relationship. Over the course of the time that we‚Äôve been together, it has been constant drama with his ex (25F). She was unhappy that he moved on, created a big social media fiasco and stopped him from seeing his daughter frequently. Sometimes he would not see his daughter for months. 

My fianc√© was done reasoning with her and was seeking the help of a group of lawyers -  when his ex messaged me to apologise. She said she wanted him to see their daughter and did not want there to be any bad blood between me and her. We both accepted the apology for the sake of him being able to see his daughter. 

She agreed that he could see his daughter, under the conditions that I would essentially be his middle man for them. He told her to forget it and that he‚Äôd just go through the legal route, as it was unfair for me. I was uncomfortable, but I also believed that him seeing his daughter was more important and put my feelings aside. This was my first mistake.

His ex girlfriend eventually began contacting my fianc√© directly. Weirdly, she also began to contact ME more frequently, oftentimes referring to me as a friend and confiding in me about her new partner. I would just sit and quietly listen, as I was uncomfortable but did not want to cause problems.

One day, she abruptly asks if I plan on having kids with my fianc√© - and if so, WHEN?! I awkwardly replied ‚Äúeventually, yes‚Äù. She then proceeds to tell me that I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot allowed‚Äù to gave kids with him, as he‚Äôs ‚Äúnot a good father to the daughter he already has‚Äù. 

This appalled me as my fianc√© is an incredible father, and quite frankly I believe that she has no business dictating what I do with my reproductive system. I lost my cool and told her to butt out and mind her own business. She said that I need to respect her as the mother of my fianc√©s daughter. I said she‚Äôs not entitled to my respect just because she has a kid.

When he came back, I had a feeling something was off but couldn‚Äôt tell what. My husband had a scandalous past, so my thoughts went to infidelity. While he was asleep, I decided to check his phone I found a missed call made to a woman (name on his phone).

There was no response from my husband after that and no contact between them. 

Upon seeing this I had a melt down and confronted my husband in the middle of the night. It caught him off guard and he apologized profusely and begged for forgiveness. He said that he was drunk and only did it for a bit of attention, that it was harmless flirting, that he didn‚Äôt actually want to sleep with her. He said he felt regret and that he would change.

I asked hubby and he said it was fine, so I went out of my way to get the room ready, my house is like a fraternity ( where it‚Äôs hubby, me and one roomate) but still I made it work if she needed a place to go she could come and stay with us, because my house is a fraternity hubby only requested for her not to leave her things in the house (as in tv and other appliances). 
But, E ended up finding a place and told me she would not stay over anymore, hubby and I were ok. Next day, she found the place but decided that didn‚Äôt like the smell of the new place, which she again asked to stay over until she figured out what to do, I said yes. 
Moving things forward, she decided to stay at her new stinky place, but needed help with moving some of her furniture, so she asked for help with my hubby truck, so I did. 
I noticed she didn‚Äôt have a mattress to sleep on, so she asked to stay in my house until she get the mattress, she stayed for about two days, which it was ok, after the two days she went to her stinky place and took some of her stuff that was in my house too. 

Moving things now, the other girls want to prepare a surprise bday party to E, because she‚Äôs turning 30 and feeling upset, and down, and they want me to help plan.

We always sat and talked after and we became even better friends. 

He got a girlfriend who‚Äôs 19 in 2022 and she started at our club too. She always gave me backhanded compliments and used every opportunity to degrade me in front of others. I wanted to be a good supportive friend so I let it slide time after time but got enough and started to clap back at her - which seemed to help and she stopped. 

In 2023 we all got along and the three of us spent a lot of time together. Slowly the her comments and backhanded comments came back I tried to play it cool and just let her for the good of the friendship we now all shared but when I got enough I clapped back again. It started to become more and more frequent I had to say something back to her because it got too much. 

Me and my friend (the bf) found our shared interest on horror film and we started watching them together at their apartment. She had anxiety and can‚Äôt handle horror and refuses to join, after we had a talk about her not liking to be alone in their bedroom while we were watching horror movies together we did it when she went to work - on her request. Now watching it when she‚Äôs not there is wrong too. I‚Äôve tried to talk to her about it since we‚Äôre all friends what to do to make her feel better - she then told me that she was afraid we were gonna hook up while she was gone. Of course neither me or the bf would ever do that but no matter what we say or do it‚Äôs not the right thing. This has been an evil circle for nine months and it‚Äôs just been getting worse.

She says it‚Äôs her mother who planted the thought in her, but plants need water to grow and it‚Äôs been nine months now. 

And it‚Äôs not like we haven‚Äôt invited her, we always do and if we do anything else than watch a horror movie we‚Äôre all three together and we used to have such a good time all three. I mean they obviously don‚Äôt invite me on dates and stuff but we just hang out the three of us.

38,1eg3dnj,AITA for not hiding my weight loss/workout regimen?,"Hello, you may remember me from such posts as The SIL who canceled Mother's Day for the rest of the World and other hits. Well, SIL is back at it again, and I don't know if I'm being toxic or if she's just obnoxious.

I used to weigh 250lbs. I'm 5'2"", so, as Dr. Now would say, this was a problem. I have lost over 80lbs as of today. I work out 90 mins a day and track calories.

I get up at 5am and work out until 6am each day (and also go for an after-dinner walk at night). This requires me to walk out of my room, through our shared living room and into the gym in the garage. In doing so I go by my SIL who is up with the baby.

SIL asked my brother to talk to me about my ""toxic diet culture"" behavior. Mainly, she would like me not wear work out clothes in the house or talk about exercise. She has also banned any talk of healthy eating, healthy choices, calorie counting, moderation or restriction. She has accused me of having an eating disorder.

I want to point out, I'm not an obnoxious gym gal. I don't go around talking about my diet or exercise regimen, it mostly comes up in answers to questions that my SIL asks. For example, she will offer me leftovers of food she picks up for dinner. I'll usually decline because it doesn't fit in my calorie budget. But she will push, and so eventually I have to say ""Sorry, it doesn't fit with my calorie goal for the day.""  This is shaming her food choices, she says.

If I get up to go for a walk she will ask me where I'm going, and then be upset at the answer.  When I went out and had to buy new clothes, she saw the bag and made a comment about how she thought I was broke. I replied that I had to use a store credit card because I just couldn't make my current wardrobe work anymore. She got upset.

This weekend she found me packaging clothes that were too big for me for donation. SIL saw a pile of dresses being put away and asked if she could borrow one. I told her if she liked them she could have all of them, since they were just going to be donated anyway. This upset her because she felt like I was calling her fat by giving her the clothes I'm too small for. SHE ASKED FOR THEM! She then told my brother I was rubbing my weight loss in her face.

My brother has gained over 50lbs since she moved in. When he expressed an interest in getting in shape along with me she shut it down. She told him intentional weight loss of any kind is toxic and disordered and that he was not allowed to do anything that could lead to intentional weight loss.

I am just at a loss for how I'm supposed to avoid upsetting SIL. She's not even that much bigger than me! Everything I do is toxic, and disordered and I'm going to give the baby an eating disorder and I'm being fatphobic etc.  And no, she does not have a history of disordered eating, and if she did we would know because she likes to collect diagnosises.

So I guess, am I a fatphobic asshole who doesn't understand how get in shape politely in 2024?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-30,"AITA for not hiding my weight loss/workout regimen?

I used to weigh 250lbs. I'm 5'2"", so, as Dr. Now would say, this was a problem. I have lost over 80lbs as of today. I work out 90 mins a day and track calories.

I get up at 5am and work out until 6am each day (and also go for an after-dinner walk at night). This requires me to walk out of my room, through our shared living room and into the gym in the garage. In doing so I go by my SIL who is up with the baby.

SIL asked my brother to talk to me about my ""toxic diet culture"" behavior. Mainly, she would like me not wear work out clothes in the house or talk about exercise. She has also banned any talk of healthy eating, healthy choices, calorie counting, moderation or restriction. She has accused me of having an eating disorder.

I want to point out, I'm not an obnoxious gym gal. I don't go around talking about my diet or exercise regimen, it mostly comes up in answers to questions that my SIL asks. For example, she will offer me leftovers of food she picks up for dinner. I'll usually decline because it doesn't fit in my calorie budget. But she will push, and so eventually I have to say ""Sorry, it doesn't fit with my calorie goal for the day.""  This is shaming her food choices, she says.

If I get up to go for a walk she will ask me where I'm going, and then be upset at the answer.  When I went out and had to buy new clothes, she saw the bag and made a comment about how she thought I was broke. I replied that I had to use a store credit card because I just couldn't make my current wardrobe work anymore. She got upset.

This weekend she found me packaging clothes that were too big for me for donation. SIL saw a pile of dresses being put away and asked if she could borrow one. I told her if she liked them she could have all of them, since they were just going to be donated anyway. This upset her because she felt like I was calling her fat by giving her the clothes I'm too small for. SHE ASKED FOR THEM! She then told my brother I was rubbing my weight loss in her face.

My brother has gained over 50lbs since she moved in. When he expressed an interest in getting in shape along with me she shut it down. She told him intentional weight loss of any kind is toxic and disordered and that he was not allowed to do anything that could lead to intentional weight loss.

I am just at a loss for how I'm supposed to avoid upsetting SIL. She's not even that much bigger than me! Everything I do is toxic, and disordered and I'm going to give the baby an eating disorder and I'm being fatphobic etc.  And no, she does not have a history of disordered eating, and if she did we would know because she likes to collect diagnosises.

So I guess, am I a fatphobic asshole who doesn't understand how get in shape politely in 2024?",0.0,0.0017610385548323393,0,1
39,1eg3cvk,AITA for doing something that backfired? ,"LONG POST. My friend and I ran into the same situation to where we both lost our homes and jobs but for different reasons. I lost mine due to fleeing an abusive relationship, in which my ex actually sold everything i owned in my apt but later found out my furniture is at his cousin‚Äôs house. So I had nothing and my kids had nothing.

We both buried ourselves in gta/fivem to escape our reality. This went on for me from March 2023- Sept 2023. Fast forward. From Mid Sept to now, I have since found me housing, working, counseling, and almost have my kids back home with me.

She on the other hand, is still stuck where we started years ago. Me and another friend(who actually stopped coming around her because she my friend was never productive) also was in the same situation as us and is also doing well would send her the same resources and jobs links we found but she would do nothing but play fivem. All day, everyday. I told her that I no longer wanted to be in discord calls or play fivem as I felt it was a big distraction for me, she got mad, said it‚Äôs no different from iMessage and hung up in my face. 

Also, I noticed that she imitates me a lot. My accent, the way she types, etc. When on fivem, we rp as twins, I have no problem with it but I like to add my own individual personality into it. But I‚Äôve literally seen her copy the outfits I wear, the hairstyles etc. she‚Äôs telling ppl that her ex stole her furniture was at her friend house. I also had to report my ex for revenge porn but she was going around telling ppl it happened to her and at the time, none of that ever happened to her.

She been with several different men having phone sex with them and even at one point went through a friend group and still is going through the group. They all call her a hoe. I defend her and she would say she doesn‚Äôt care what they say. Now, it‚Äôs to the point to where she‚Äôs doing this with guys she just met. 

She got drunk one night and had phone sex with yet another guy she barely knew. Sent him nudes. She found out he had a gf and left him. That day he started he posted what the nudes she sent, starting harass harassing her, then me. This man can pull up addresses, home addresses, everything. She admitted to doing things to purposely antagonize him. And thats where I had to draw the line. 

She‚Äôs done nothing but gone down hill since I met her and it hurts me to see some of things she doing to herself. So I went and talked to the friend that stopped coming around because she‚Äôs the only other person that really knows her. Just out of genuine concern because I‚Äôve tried talking my friend but she doesn‚Äôt listen and won‚Äôt listen. So when asked the other friend to just talk to her, it backfired on me because the girl went and told her bf and it got to several others. It got back to my friend, who now wants nothing to do with me and said that she looks at me weird. I‚Äôve apologized for it I don‚Äôt know how many times. But AITA?

41,1eg350e,AITA for cancelling a trip last minute because of my personal sense of modesty and ruining everyone's summer,"

I (16 M) recently planned on going to a waterpark with my friends, we all had our summer vacation and we do this sort of thing every year where we all pool our savings and then go somewhere fun.

Last year it was a fancy restaurant, this year it was supposed to be a waterpark. We usually do this only once as each one of us pools a large sum of money into the grand sum and so the whole thing is kinda expensive. We plan these things in advance because most of us are away for the holidays to our hometowns and only have a week or so to do it before school starts. 

Recently, we booked a pretty fancy private pool with a farmhouse and a BBQ grill all to ourselves and it cost us all quite a bit. 

Well, we pooled our money and spent it on the reservation. The day before we were supposed to go there, I was just looking at the list of rules the place we booked a reservation for has, and one of the rules stated (and this is what I remember) that 

Only those with proper swimwear are allowed inside the pool area. T shirts are not allowed. Some sort of a pool hygiene or a clog preventive measure thing. 

I called them and they explained the whole thing ti me. Normally, you are allowed to wear any sort of clothes you want to the pool as long as they are not too heavy but in this fancy-a** resort, they were pretty stringent about enforcing their rules

So here's the thing, I've been extremely shy about my body my whole life. I never take off my shirt when I go swimming, heck, I never even wear shorts. I dress in a t shirt and trousers, even while swimming. I'm not fat or even underweight for that matter, I consider my physique to be above average however I have this unspoken rule about myself, it's quite odd but my sense of personal modesty is very extreme and throughout my whole childhood, I have gotten into fights with my parents about this stuff. I feel disgusting about it and the feeling of being exposed just creeps me out, even being in a tanktop by myself makes me feel like I'm naked. To top it off, I can't even look at someone who is uncovered without fidgeting but I can somehow tolerate it, I've been to waterparks all my life, so I've been kind of desensitized to seeing others.

To cut the story short, I told my friends about this and they tried their best to talk me out of this ""phobia"" but eventually they realised it wasn't going to work. So I made the right choice, I told them that they are welcome to go without me as I didn't want to spoil anyone's fun and even let them keep my money. 

Much to my dismay, everyone else backed out of the plan too and we got a refund from the resort. 
I now have this dreadful feeling that I ruined my friends' vacation as this was their only chance to do something fun before school began. 


Edit: yes, I could have bought rash guards but it's important to note that I only saw this rule after midnight, the day we were supposed to go (in the morning, after breakfast) and I didn't have enough time to purchase one, or even find out if it's available nearby.

45,1eg29fo,AITA for telling my roommate what her friends had said about her?,"I‚Äôm F22. One of my senior year roommates is Abi. She‚Äôs very sweet and we had a good friendship, but Abi is extremely hard to live with. Abi has many issues that went untreated and very often expected us to drop everything to help her through breakdowns, as well as tiptoe around her in fear of triggering one. She also drank too much which made everything worse.

Bc of the difficulties living with her, my other roommates and I would vent about her. Start of senior year I had a class with Abi‚Äôs 3 ‚Äúbest friends‚Äù since freshman year. We started studying together for that class which led to us hanging out.

In the beginning I tried to invite Abi, but they told me they didn‚Äôt want her to come. They explained that they were sick of dealing with her issues and were essentially pretending to be her friends until graduation. They then told me tons of stories of things Abi has done, plus information about her issues that I hadn‚Äôt known about. They outright told me they hated her. 

After that, Abi would always come up in conversation when I‚Äôd hang out with them. I‚Äôll be fully honest about the fact that I gossipped too, as much as I regret it. I‚Äôd vent about Abi‚Äôs breakdown of the week, and things like Abi waking us up in the middle of the night drunk bc she needed help (common occurance).

Throughout this time, Abi‚Äôs 3 friends would hang out with her, tell her they were friends forever, etc.

One day Abi went out with them and when she got back she was pale and nervous. She sat me down and told me that they‚Äôd informed her I was talking shit about her. They told her everything I‚Äôd said and that they just wanted her to know because they were worried about her. I was shocked, especially because the things they would say about Abi were 1000% worse. I took accountability and apologized to Abi, but then I also told her these were group conversations and that those girls were not her friends. She asked what I meant, so I told her what they‚Äôd been saying.

She went and talked to them, and they told her I was lying and they‚Äôd never said anything bad about her. When Abi came back to confront me about my ‚Äúlie‚Äù I told her 3 years worth of extreme detail about her life that I only could‚Äôve gotten from those girls.

This led to them spreading a rumor across my entire (very small) campus that they‚Äôd trusted me and I‚Äôd just randomly gone up to Abi and started telling her what they said, and that I couldn‚Äôt be trusted. It caused and still causes major issues with friends I‚Äôd had for years and I spent months having nobody at my college that would even talk to me because of it all.

They came to talk to me again recently as everyone was moving out and told me I was the asshole for telling Abi what they‚Äôd said.

I‚Äôd vent about Abi‚Äôs breakdown of the week, and things like Abi waking us up in the middle of the night drunk bc she needed help (common occurance).

Throughout this time, Abi‚Äôs 3 friends would hang out with her, tell her they were friends forever, etc.

One day Abi went out with them and when she got back she was pale and nervous. She sat me down and told me that they‚Äôd informed her I was talking shit about her. They told her everything I‚Äôd said and that they just wanted her to know because they were worried about her. I was shocked, especially because the things they would say about Abi were 1000% worse. I took accountability and apologized to Abi, but then I also told her these were group conversations and that those girls were not her friends. She asked what I meant, so I told her what they‚Äôd been saying.

She went and talked to them, and they told her I was lying and they‚Äôd never said anything bad about her. When Abi came back to confront me about my ‚Äúlie‚Äù I told her 3 years worth of extreme detail about her life that I only could‚Äôve gotten from those girls.

This led to them spreading a rumor across my entire (very small) campus that they‚Äôd trusted me and I‚Äôd just randomly gone up to Abi and started telling her what they said, and that I couldn‚Äôt be trusted. It caused and still causes major issues with friends I‚Äôd had for years and I spent months having nobody at my college that would even talk to me because of it all.

They came to talk to me again recently as everyone was moving out and told me I was the asshole for telling Abi what they‚Äôd said.

Ik I shouldn‚Äôt have gossipped with them in the first place. But AITA for telling Abi all they said about her once I found out they‚Äôd repeated what I‚Äôd said?",2.0,0.09343892335891724,0,0
46,1eg21sj,AITA For Not Sharing My Inheritance?,"Throwaway Account 

I (30f) am my paternal grandmother's only granddaughter and she has left me almost everything and my cousins (who are all boys) hate me for it. 

Growing up my grandmother always seemed like a person who was constantly disinterested, annoyed, emotionally guarded but now that I'm older and know the story I can see why she was so bitter and depressed. In the 1960s when more and more women were starting to go to college my grandma was encouraged to pursue a higher education by her (female) teachers while her parents shrugged it off. 

My grandma applied and was accepted into a college with a scholarship and was so happy. It was all set but the week after high school graduation her father's boss came to the home to meet with her. Apparently, my great-grandfather has a gambling problem that he tried to hide and now my grandma's family was in danger of being homeless. My great-grandfather made a deal with his boss to pay off his debts if my grandma married the boss' son. My grandma obviously didn't want to do it but was emotionally manipulated into accepting and she never went to college. 

My grandma had my dad shortly after she got married and became trapped raising her 2 stepsons and her own sons. Her dad and other male relatives never stopped coming to her husband for money and he would  lord it over her all time while being a terrible husband to her. The only thing that her husband did good was make sure that she was taken care of financially before and after his passing. Almost everything was in her name after he passed but it didn't stop my uncles and dad from trying to siphon money away for themselves. 

My mom was the one who found out and blew the whistle on it which I feel was one of the factors that led to my parents' divorce. My uncles threaten to withhold contact if my grandma didn't do what they wanted but she really didn't care. I think it's because she may have never really wanted to be a mom. She still sent me and my cousins (her sisters' grandchildren) presents and when I got a little older I tried to re-establish a relationship. I was never really as close to her as I was with my maternal grandma but we did have something. 

When my grandma passed she set it up so that most of her assets went to charities and organizations and to me while leaving a few items for her sons, stepsons, and their children so they couldn't contest the will. My male relatives are harassing me to share but I know my grandma didn't want them to get a dime so AITA?   ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-30,"AITA For Not Sharing My Inheritance? Throwaway Account

so i (20nb) live with two of my friends. at one point me and my roommate liam (23m) dated for almost two years. for the last year we were in an open relationship in which he started dating one of my friends, mia(20f), who was intending to move in with us. shortly after she moved in with us, me and liam broke up. (her moving in and her relationship with him had minimal affect on our relationship and decision to break up)

we broke up because i was doing horribly mentally due to some illnesses i am now getting help for professionally. he was having a hard time supporting me through this and emotionally blocked himself off from me and would actively ignore me any time i asked for help. 

me doing bad like this led to me not picking up my weight on chores leaving my portion of things undone and mostly falling onto him and mia. he sat down and told me that i need to start doing better with chores or i was going to have to move out. at this time he just wanted more space but a few days later told me that he felt me and him should take a break.

 i came to the conclusion that me and him just weren't working in a relationship and i told him that i didn't want to get back together but i wanted to remain friends. we were okay and i set a lot of effort in making sure my portion of chores got done even though i wasn't doing well.

he would constantly apologize to me about how he treated me when i was doing poorly and told me that he wanted to get better at emotional support for people in general. 

as of the last month he has been almost avoiding me conversation wise. if im talking he will interupt me to talk about something as if i wasnt speaking to begin with (will apologize if i mention that i was talking and then just. wait for me to be done). or if im talking to mia about work he will begin to talk about his day at work and tell me that his day was much harder than mine. he will not communicate to me if plans that affect the three of us as a group change and then get frustrated. when i have no idea whats going on.

all of this is context to a conversation we had a few days ago. he came into the living room and asked me if we could talk and told me that he felt i was getting worse mentally and he was hurt that i wouldn't talk to him about it. i explained to him that that was not true and that just because i wasn't talking to him doesn't mean that i was doing poorly. he made it hard for me to want to even talk to him and since we are no longer in a relationship i do not owe him that information.

he is now mad at me and has been treating me even more weirdly. we just signed another lease with another friend for a bigger place and i'm kind of worried about it, but i'm not sure if im the one who's causing these issues. should i be talking to him about how im doing more often?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-30,"AITA for not going to my roommate / ex for emotional support

50,1eg1dgs,AITA for coming out as trans during my grandfather‚Äôs funeral? ,"Me (21M) and my grandpa were pretty close, he was an accepting guy for being 90. I had come out to some of my family members I could trust including him and my parents, but I hadn‚Äôt mentioned it to everyone.

I was to give a speech at his funeral, and I of course was very emotional and got off course a bit. During the end his memory was getting really bad and he would accidentally deadname me or call me the wrong pronouns, but every time I corrected him he would always be accepting all over again and say how brave or unique I was.

During the speech I said how kind he was and how accepting he was and I kind of forgot my audience. I said that one of my best memories was that every time I would correct him about my pronouns he would re accept me every time, I didn‚Äôt even really think about it until later when I realized what I said and went oh shit. But again I didn‚Äôt think it was the end of the world, at least everyone knows now and I don‚Äôt have to make such a big deal of coming out.

Nobody talked about it during the ceremony I guess not to make a scene, people just said it was nice or acted kind of awkward, but again I didn‚Äôt think anything of it because everyone was emotional.

It wasn‚Äôt until later that night that my dad got a text from my uncle(60M) saying that he should talk to me about my speech and how it was self centered. He said something along the lines that it was a very nice speech but people were only talking about me and not my grandpa and that I made some people even more upset than they already were. He said that I should never have mentioned my gender and it should have remained a personal memory between me and grandpa. 

My dad understands where he‚Äôs coming from but is on my side and said he didn‚Äôt see how it was a big deal. I explained I just said it in the moment and he said I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong even if I planned to say it because it was just a happy memory.

He is a only son, she lives 2h away from us and she always plays these power games where she is always complaining by phone that we do not visit her but then she never allows us to do it. In 2 weeks we will have some vacation days and my husband would like to go to visit her. He asked her over the phone and she said she will think about it. She always does this and sometimes she just confirms in the day before or even some hours in advance, and we need to rush to pack the car and go there or sometimes she just refuses that we go last minute and then we have no possibility to book somewhere nice to go instead.

  
She does the same if we invite her to come to our house. She will not confirm until last minute, so we are not able to book other things to do with friends, and sometimes I prepare the guest room and she simply decides not to come. Since last year I told my husband I am done with preparing any guest room or making any arrangements to her in our house as I feel she does not respects us. Also happens the other way around that she does not call in advance and then she simply arrives here and if we are not home she demands we need to return. Last time this happened I told my husband no way we would go home (we were 30min away in another town to go to movies and dinner in a nice restaurant), we didn't go as she was really upset with him.

My FIL does not have any action on this, he just does what the wife says. She has no friends or other family around, so she is always alone with FIL at their house. When I go there she cooks for us and does all the chores because she does not allow me to move around the house, I am not able to enter the kitchen. I just go to the dinning room, bedroom and bathroom, so she really has a heavy burden of work, because she does all the cooking and cleaning when we are there but is her choice.

This time I told my husband that either she confirms still this week that we are allowed to go to her house or I will simply book some days off in a nice hotel in advance and I do not care if she then says last minute that we can go. My husband is upset and says I am TA because we should just understand she is old and complicated and go along with what she wants.

53,1eg0kso,WIBTA if I backed out of a trip ,"I have been invited on a trip to Italy and have been excited to attend. The plan is to fly to Rome then to Palermo and stay in a villa of a friend for a few days. I am then going to stay later and do Capri and Rome some more.  I have previously visited Milan, Rome, and Florence and do love Italy. 

The issue is that nothing has been planned. We are leaving in 6 weeks and I literally just received the address of the residence. My friend who is planning keeps saying she is busy and doesn't have time to go through everything but will not share anything with us. I would be fine planning my own vacation but due to not knowing where the villa is it is hard to plan for excursions, restaurants, and transportation. Myself and others have asked a number of times to meet up or have a call and it has been ignored. 

Today we received a text about needing to rent a car and how the planner already rented one with her husband. While the cost isn't huge I am more annoyed that this wasn't shared with us previously. We have no basic itinerary and no basic budget. My friend said an email is coming but we have heard that for weeks. 

I am frustrated one that we have no information but also that I do not have any input into this trip. This is my vacation as well and I do not think it is fair that I have zero say in what if anything we are doing. 

Clouding my judgement is that I just received word that I will be going on a large international trip for work this November as well. I am going to extend my trip and would love to get some PTO days and money back if Italy is going to be a bust.

55,1eg0bd2,AITA for splitting repair costs in half?,"When my older sister and I lived in the same university town my parents bought a car for our use and it was registered and insured on my name. I took care of all maintenance, gas, and parking and repair costs and was the sole driver. My sister has done a lot for me and I am grateful for whatever she did.

She was often out of town for months or semesters elsewhere while I used it regularly. When she was around, I took her shopping every week and wherever she needed to go, when we could plan it together. She has complained that I did not just hand her the keys and let her take it whenever she wanted and that I insisted she respect my schedule when it came to going anywhere together. I had a very busy schedule, as did she.

When I moved out of town, my sister still had a few years left to finish her degree.
I gave her the car without asking her to pay anything for my share of its value (she had given me her old car once before, when it was worth very little), and before giving it to her I took it to a mechanic and got comprehensive repairs done. (She never did this when she gave me her old car, nor have I ever asked why).

The total cost of the auto repair was about four times the average annual car repair costs, with premium replacements of parts and new tires and the works. I paid half and so did she. I thought it was a nice thing to do for her and hoped the car would help her run errands and do groceries without any trouble over the next years. I didn‚Äôt ask her to say thanks and she didn‚Äôt. 

Now I find out that seven years later, she complains and is still feeling bitter and resentful about having to pay half the costs of the repairs. She mentioned to my mom that she paid ‚Äúthousands of dollars‚Äù while completely omitting to mention that I had also paid exactly the same amount, for a vehicle I‚Äôd never use again that would be for her sole use thereafter, just so it would stay in good condition for her.

AITA for not paying the full cost of the repair before giving her the car? Is she justified in holding onto this resentment?

Edit: Only went ahead with the repairs after she had seen and approved the mechanic‚Äôs estimate.

Edit: Bulk of the cost of buying the car was contributed by my parents. I paid too. That‚Äôs why it was registered and insured on my name. Nothing was contributed by my sister.

Also this is in a comment hat got downvoted to hell


I just bought myself a new car, this leaves me with an extra car which I was doing to sell back to my dealership. It‚Äôs is a Toyota Corolla 2018 which is in good condition.

My sister asked if I would be willing to sell it to my niece. She is going to college in a few months and she will needs a car. My niece ( I am going to call her Luna)  has always been a social shy person. I haven‚Äôt seen her much, I just moved back to my home state

I told them I can bring it by to look at it. I get to their home and my sister and Luna were waiting. I start to show them the car and giving the basic information. I ask who will be buying it and my sister answers. She tells me that Luna is buying it and it will be in her name

So I start speaking my to her or at least trying to.  Ever question I asked her, her mom would answer.  For example, I asked her how much she saved up? Her mom answered. I ask how soon would she need the car? Her mom answered.

I have heard like five word the whole time I have been here and it was when she was talking to her mom. I ask if she is interested in the car and her mom answer.  I told my sister I asked Luna and wait for Luna to respond. I repeat the question and she doesn‚Äôt give an answer and just looks at her mom.

I inform both of them I am not willing to sell my car if the person buying it can not communicate with me.  So I ask again what she thinks of the car, she turns around and walks inside.

I informed my sister I will not be selling Luna the car. We get into an argument that I shouldn‚Äôt have put her on the spot and I know she is shy. I point out that it her daughter can not communicate and she will be eaten alive at college .

I told her I will be willing to sell it to Luna if she contacts me. My sister called me a jerk 


Update: I received a call form dad ( my Bil). I don't know what is going on in that family but he made it very clear to not sell the car to anyone ( I wasn't going to anyways) 

In short Luna can not afford it and they are on debt.

Well yesterday my mom asked me if I would help them pack and move and I finally told her no. I also told her she should leave him and let her know my house is open to her when she does. 
Am I the asshole for telling my mom no? I know she needs my help becuase he won't help her pack but I'm truly over this man! 
Also advise is heavily needed on how I should help my mom out of this situation! ",0.0,-0.010897738859057426,0,1

64,1efyop3,AITA for confronting someone who accused me of gaslighting?,"  

I (23) was having an online argument with another person (20s) who I used to be on a staff team with for a Discord server. At a point where he said I was being a jerk about something, I responded by saying I was direct, to which he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna let you gaslight me.‚Äù

Naturally, I was extremely taken aback by this, but before I could ask what he meant by it, I regretfully allowed the argument to swerve a bit in direction. I did later ask what he meant in the discussion, but he simply cited something else from earlier as ‚Äúthe only thing that matters in this discussion,‚Äù just not really answering. When I tried to ask again, he said ‚Äúgoodnight‚Äù and conveniently ended the conversation.

Hopefully it is reasonable to be concerned about someone accusing you of something as reprehensible as gaslighting, so about a week and a half later, I tried to ask him again what meant by it, he simply said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what you were doing‚Äù and tried to say it was because I was ‚Äúharping on that one point‚Äù and because of that, claimed he didn‚Äôt remember what the discussion was about. 

 Am I crazy, or is trying to find out why I was accused of gaslighting a reasonable thing to be worried about and try to do?

He continued his rant, saying I ‚Äúneeded a therapist‚Äù (even though I have one) because I was ‚Äúobsessed with this one criticism,‚Äù even saying there was more I could work on. I know I am a flawed individual, but I still don‚Äôt know where the gaslighting claim comes from.

When I got confused and asked him again, he responded by saying that I did indeed gaslight, but that ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt change for the better.‚Äù I got desperate and basically pleaded for him to explain exactly what I did or said that could be seen as ‚Äúgaslighting,‚Äù but instead of saying what it was, he again said I was harping on it and was obsessed. 

Again‚Ä¶is that not normal, to want to get to the bottom of being accused of that?

He said that he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt mean it that way‚Äù and that he meant it in another definition of the word, but looking it up, I can find no second definition of the word, so I have no idea what that he‚Äôs on about. When I said I had every right to focus him accusing me of this, he simply said ‚Äúthen I can easily call you obsessed.‚Äù Clearly desperate for clarity now, I asked in a different way, but he replied just by saying the word ‚Äúchange‚Äù in quotes. I said I didn‚Äôt follow, and he just said ‚Äúwhatever dude, I‚Äôm done,‚Äù which checks out given how the other discussion ended. This time I did try to be extremely articulate about the matter, but he said he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt say anything as dire as I think he did‚Äù and that I was ‚Äúlooking way too deeply into this.‚Äù I asked if gaslighting wasn‚Äôt dire, and he blocked me.

Again, I‚Äôm curious now, is gaslighting not something serious enough that if someone accuses you of it, you shouldn‚Äôt try and find out why it happened? Is it not dire enough to try and sort out?

65,1efyn2l,WIBTAH if I refused to pay for a crazy expensive bachelorette party?,"Please forgive any formatting errors as I'm writing on my phone. 

So my (32F) cousin (34F) (we'll call her Calli) is getting married early next year. We're pretty close, we even lived together for a few years in college. We don't talk every day but at least once a month and at all family events. 

This is the first marriage for both her and her man. They're very excited and are going all out with the wedding (we live in a fairly cheap state but her wedding will still cost around $40K). Our families don't have a lot of money so she's putting most of the expenses on credit cards, doing payment plans, and she even took out a small loan. I don't think that's a great idea, but I've kept my mouth shut. After all, it's not my wedding. 

Anyway, earlier this year Calli asked if I would be her maid of honor along with another married friend of ours. I was incredibly excited and of course, said yes. I knew there would be many expenses: dress, hair, makeup, shoes, bridal showers, and the bachelorette party. So I saved my tax refund from this year to make sure I had all the costs covered and I've eagerly paid for everything Calli has asked for. 

Now to the problem. The other Maid of Honor called me the other day and told me that Calli is wanting to go to Disneyland for her bachelorette party. The bride wants three days in California with an AirBnB. I kind of lost my mind over how much that would cost and I called Calli. I tried to be as polite as possible and told her that this felt more like a vacation than a *party* and I couldn't afford it. She burst into tears and told me that she has paid for super expensive bachelorette parties for some of her other friends and she deserves to have the same thing. She even suggested I get a credit card. I wasn't sure what to say to that, so I told her I'd do some budgeting and figure it out. 

But the thing is, I simply cannot afford that. I don't have any credit cards, and the few loans I have, I've been working really hard on paying off. I'm very conscious of my spending as my parents were never great with their money. They have filed for bankruptcy several times, had vehicles repossessed and we were evicted once when I was a kid. I refuse to end up like them, and am very uncomfortable with the idea of getting a credit card to essentially pay to take Calli on a pre-wedding vacation. 

I feel like an awful person, but I simply cannot afford this. I know this will upset her and she will be very angry and will probably cry.

We even moved in together for college.

A few months ago he had a bad break up with his girlfriend and to cheer him up I took him for drinks. We ended up getting a bit wasted and we at some point ended up in bed together.

69,1efy2h8,AITA for kicking out my fiance's dog from the room,"I know how the title sounds and I know a lot of people adore dogs and might be quick to jump on me so please read this first.

I have asthma and am allergic to dogs. Its not a very bad allergy I can be around them but if I pet them, have them on top of me or my things, I get swollen eyes, itchy throat and it activates my asthma and I struggle to breathe. So to avoid this if I pet a dog I immediately wash my hands afterwards. If I let a dog jump on top of me once I get home I have to immediately take a shower and wash my clothes.

My fiance and I are both 20 and a month ago we were living with his mother and his sister. They have a dog who has been there for ten years. An old dog who is some mix of Maltese. I knew about the dog going in. I was told he's hypoallergenic. Unfortunately he wasn't. The dog was very used to being in my fiance's room even sleeping in the bed overnight. I tried to put up with it but my allergies were getting to be too much and I told my fiance that the dog is no longer allowed in the room. He can't be in the room because his fur gets in the bed that I sleep in, it gets on my clothes and me washing my hands and regularly showering wasn't working since I could barely sleep without feeling like I was suffocating.

My fiance agreed especially since this was my health on the line. But the dog was so used to being in the room that every time we took him out he would scratch for hours at the door. he would bark, scratch whine. All of it. His mom got really upset at me. Said I hated the dog and that I need to let him in the room. That I was being cruel to the animal. Also btw never said any of these things to me. No she said it all to my fiance.

She told everyone i was abusing the dog by kicking him out and that I hate animals. And everyone started telling me to let him in. Eventually the dog learned he was no longer allowed in the room and wouldn't even step foot in the room even when the door was open because he knew he was going to be ushered out.

Now my fiance and I moved out thankfully but we are thinking of getting a dog and we live in a studio apartment and I'm thinking of getting a poodle since they are indeed hypoallergenic and I have been around them without it activating my allergies. Now his mom is going around saying how I just hated her dog because now I'm getting a dog in an apartment with no rooms so how will I keep it out of my things like I did with her dog.

Now people in my life are fifty fifty. They do believe I had the right to kick the dog out of the room because I was paying rent, and because i need to keep my health in mind. Some people I know were saying I was a bit of an asshole because I was the newcomer and I disrupted the dogs routine, and probably annoyed everyone in the apartment because the dog was barking and crying because of me not letting it in the room.

One moment I'm the love of his life, the next he's on hook up apps and saying he did it simply because he was upset with me. The sum it up the pattern would be, we're good for a month or two, he does something disrespectful to the relationship and then gets upset with me if I speak on it but will silently punish me for expressing my discomfort. Which would mean dissappearing for days with no response, cheating, or abandoning all responsibilities and leaving me to care for the house and pets alone. His family's aware of this but they enable him by allowing him to hide away at their homes for days while hes on apps. 

The stress of the relationship caused me so many issues with weight loss, headaches, and severe anxiety due to never really knowing what type of man I'd wake up to. Fast forward to now, his mother has been on life support due to cancer. Throughout the process I've been giving him a lot of grace and trying to support him through her health. We had an upset Friday to where I expressed how I felt he had mentally checked out and how it made me feel but I was okay with being patient. Apparently me saying that upset him and caused him to completely ghost me for the day and post all over social media drinking for the day instead of being with his mother while she was dying. Something in me just snapped and I ended up cursing him out, basically saying fuck him, his mother and the entire family. Since then he has tried to contact me and I've changed my number while also throwing all of his belongings away. While I know the relationship was abusive, I still feel like shit for saying what said about mother despite everything I've been through. Please tell me whether I'm crazy or not.

71,1efxl5q,AITA for not giving my sister my childhood gold earrings?,"I (20F) was told by my mom that on my first birthday she was given gold earrings as a gift for me. A few times in my childhood I wore these. 

I grew up however not knowing that these were a present for me and not just my mom‚Äôs jewellery. Earlier this year my sister (16F) without my knowledge took these earrings from my mom promising her she would wear them for a temporary time, which my mom agreed to. My sister then proceeded to wear these earrings for a month or so, and since I didn‚Äôt know they were mine I didn‚Äôt care at all. 

Now a week ago she almost lost these earrings due to carelessness, and my mom got upset and while upset told me it was my childhood earrings she had been wearing this entire time. I asked her why she‚Äôs only telling me this now but she responded with ‚ÄúI told you before you just didn‚Äôt listen‚Äù which I don‚Äôt know if this is true or not. 

So I asked for the earrings back which my mom did give to me. She agreed that it wasn‚Äôt right for my sister to take these from me as her own, but in response my sister began giving the silent treatment, crying, and overall becoming really upset that the earrings were taken from her. My relatives and other family members seeing this kept coming up to me telling me ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a good sister, lend your sister the earrings so she can wear them too‚Äù or ‚ÄúYour sister has built a connection with these earrings already, you weren‚Äôt even wearing them so give them to her‚Äù all of which I didn‚Äôt listen to, because if they were my gift, why am I obligated to give them back to her due to the connection she built with them without my knowledge?

I would like to hear other opinions on this to see what y‚Äôall think. 



Edit: Thank you to everyone who responded so far. There are comments saying my mom should give my sister her own pair, but the thing is she has another pair of gold earrings that my sister herself wore, but my sister just does not want them. My mom offered to buy her new gold earrings however she wanted, but she refused this offer too and is still giving the silent treatment. 

I am used to being too nice of a person and a people pleaser by keeping the peace and just doing what everyone asks of me, but I‚Äôve become more aware of these tendencies this year which is why I decided to hold onto these earrings even if it meant this type of conflict would remain. In my opinion, I think my sister is being manipulative as she knew they were mine since childhood before she took them (I forgot to clarify this earlier).

So I (22M) have been talking to this girl (>18F) for about 4 days. We met online through a video game and over these last couple days we've had a lot of fun playing together. We both have made some pretty bad jokes, and she's made some pretty edgy jokes, which I didn't think much of at the time. It all seemed great until today, we'd been playing for a couple of hours until I made an, in hindsight inappropriate, joke calling her ""The good type of mentally ill type of person"". She did not take that well, as she said I was just like every other guy she's spoken too, and went on to spend the next 40-ish minutes telling me I should off myself for everyone's sake, and calling me various homophobic slurs. I realize in hindsight that what I said could easily be seen as predatory, so I know what I did was wrong, and in that sense I was the asshole, but I'm not sure if her reaction was warranted given that I immediately apologized and tried to explain that I didn't mean it like that.",Asshole,2024-07-30,"AITA for telling a girl she's the fun type of mentally ill?

74,1efwjy8,AITA for wearing the outfit I was supposed to wear for my birthday dinner at my friends wedding bc she had it on my birthday??,"Hi all , I am writing this because I have received mixed reactions from the people in my life. I 21F had a big 21st birthday party/ dinner planned a year in advance because that kind of thing is very important in my culture. Invitations were sent out last year with the theme and everything ready, there were down payments made to secure venues , catering , etc. My childhood best friend 23F and her husband 27M had a on and off relationship for about 3 years , no one anticipated their wedding. So it came as a shock to everyone when they announced their wedding which was meant to be on the same weekend as my birthday 2 weeks after I announced my birthday party. I was livid and immediately started blowing up their phones because I felt like they were trying to take my spotlight. I was advised to postpone my party so that I can attend the wedding because it would be held in another country and if I missed it I would be a bad friend and I would be an even worse friend if I made everyone choose over a birthday party and a wedding.

I could tell my friend was a bit upset because she wasn‚Äôt talking to me but I thought maybe she was just preoccupied and stressed out about all the things that didn‚Äôt go well that day.

75,1efwbbb,AITA for telling my dad and stepmom they embarrassed me in public by telling their families what my stepsisters did and made nothing better?,"Please tell me if I'm being an ungrateful brat or not. So my dad is married to Claire. I (16f) was 8 when they got married. Claire had two daughters before she met my dad, aka my stepsisters, Elle (16f) and Miri (17f). At first we were only together half the time because the girls were with their dad. My mom died when I was 6 so I lived with my dad 100% of the time. My dad and Claire rushed things and Claire's girls never really liked me. They weren't that mean back then but they'd ignore me a lot. But it got worse when their dad got more angry about my stepmom getting married again. I saw him a handful of times and he was a jerk to me, he insulted me and called me names. He also made a big deal out of hating my dad. Elle and Miri started taunting me about it then and telling me how much they and their dad hated me.

We did go to family therapy for like 2 years. It sucked.

The last 10 months have been really bad for me, personally. I lost my maternal great grandma. My maternal aunt moved to Australia and while we stay in touch, she and I were super close so it was a big change for me. My best friend was diagnosed with cancer and I'm trying to be strong and brave for her and she's doing so much better but it terrified me that was going to die too. It's the kind of cancer my mom had too. But my best friends was caught way earlier which helped. Without her around me I also started getting bullied.

When a high school trip came up my dad was really eager for me to go, especially when my stepsisters were also going. My stepmom and dad thought my stepmom finally got through to them because they were being civil with me, sometimes even seeming friendly. Then the day we were leaving I was put on a bus with them and they brought food their dad had made. I was sitting with them and their friends (teacher assigned seating) and they shared it with all of them except me. Then they mocked me because I was starving by the time we arrived to our first stop. They also grabbed my prepaid card that was for buying food and stuff. I only got it back when we arrived to the hotel we were staying at. Miri and Elle were separated after that because we were grouped up by grade once we got there. But Elle had told her mom we were going to share and then when we were there she picked her friend and left me. She refused to let me be a third in their room when the teacher asked.

When the trip was over my stepmom was furious. Fast forward a few months and on Saturday we were at my stepmom's family's house and my paternal relatives were there too. Dad and stepmom told everyone there what my stepsisters had done. I was so embarrassed because they had to talk about how nobody wanted me and it was forced. I told them afterwards they had embarrassed me and it didn't help because it made Elle and Miri dislike me more because their family knew what they'd done now. My dad and stepmom told me I should be happy they'd stand up for me and that I upset them by scolding them.

I generally stay in my room most the day, and my mum always complains about it, but in reality, there are quite a few reasons I do it. 

1. Most the things I do are just not things I need to do outside of my room, like playing my bass, adding to my family tree and studying. 

2. My mum and sister kind of just dislike my presence or smth I don't even know. My grandmother requested we don't mistreat the sofa , meaning don't jump on it etc, but my mum always yells at me for overly petty things like having the cushions at the wrong angle. Every time I want to play with my sister She keeps screaming at me to stop annoying her when I just come and ask if she wants to play. So yeah, it's pretty mentally exhausting, so I just stick to my room, however my room has pretty terrible Internet so if I want to scroll reddit or smth  I have to be in the communal living room. 

Now, My sister has a really annoying habit of singing or making noise purposefully whenever I am In the same room as her.

Then my mum starts screaming at Me and saying mu behaviour is horrible and she's not going to take me on holiday again. I am just saying, that I want reasonable quiet when I'm in the living room and that my sister has so many other rooms to be loud. My mum then compares it to my bass, even though I put it at low volume and close my door and window to make sure I'm not disturbing anyone.

Then the Internet goes out and she just randomly blames me for it, and she asks me to come to the beach with her, but since she hates being with Me so much I refused, and said If she hates my behaviour then I just won't be near her so she doesn't have to deal with it.

She said I was overreacting but I just pointed out I was looking forward to having a night with her, not a night with her friends.

They were being nasty to the other server so I asked her if she covered one of my tables and I‚Äôll take her table until they leave, she agreed and a manger approved it.

I told them that they couldn‚Äôt get anything free but I could ask for a discount from the manager. They said a discount wouldn‚Äôt be enough, but I proceeded to go find my manager anyway.

My sister and I have never gotten along, always fighting(She's never have had a job in her life and I try to push her to get one and she doesn't like that and it causes fights)  even gotten that bad which caused me to moved out. 
Now the problem here is, that now that I have ownership of the house, I'm not liking what she had done to my dad's house. The top floor, which consists of three bedrooms and full of toys squishmellows etc, and it's not even set up nearly. When I say full, I mean full, to the point you can't see the floors in any of the rooms and there's just mess everywhere. 
So I decided to put my foot down and tell her she either needs to clean it up and get rid of it, or she needs to move out, which she then said was unfair and that it's her collection and that they mean something to her. For which I replied with it's either those options or to go out and get a job to help around the house. Which then she started crying and ran off.

82,1efvd4m,WIBTAH if I cancelled a trip to visit my wife and her family while my father in law is in the hospital?,"Background: several weeks ago, my FIL had an unexpected health emergency. As soon as we got the call I dropped everything to travel with my wife to where her parents live (hundreds of miles away). We got there very late at night and things were hairy.

I stayed for about a week, driving them to and from the hospital 40 minutes away (neither my wife nor mother in law can drive), spending 9 hours a day with them at the hospital etc.

I then came back home for a few days (needed clothes, medicine for my own chronic condition etc.) and then visited them for another few days the following weekend.

At that point, while things were still extremely serious, the immediate risk of death crisis had abated. I went home again for a couple of weeks, and visited again this past weekend (my wife stayed up there the whole time).

While I was home, my wife's uncle (MIL's brother) visited to help out from quite far away. MIL is clearly bitter that I didn't go up to visit again while her brother was there.

I went up to visit again this past weekend, and MIL was very cold, didn't say hello, made several snide remarks etc. I tried to cut her some slack because she's obviously going through a lot. Then at one point she made a remark about how her brother was so much more helpful (as I'm driving her and my wife the 40 minutes each way to the hospital).

To her credit, my wife made her apologize to me. MIL comes up with a sort of bullshit apology about how I must have ""misunderstood"" what she said.

Anyway, I had planned to visit again in a week and a half or so, but am strongly considering texting my MIL and wife that I'm cancelling and not coming up.

The in laws live hundreds of miles away from my home, I work a demanding full time job, and it costs like $400-500 round trip (plus 10 hours of travel time round trip). It's exhausting and I don't want to do all that just to put up with shit from my MIL.

My wife and FIL are obviously pretty blameless in this, but I'm considering saying fuck it and just spending the weekend with my friends/relaxing/getting a massage or something instead.

84,1efurjg,AITA for not babysitting an adult at a party,"
This happened last semester, but I still hear about it from time to time, and my friends seem to be divided; some of them think I'm a jerk for this, and some of them say I'm not, so I wanted to see what you guys thought.

So, I'm in college, and last fall I met a girl, let's call her Samantha (not her real name.) I kind of had a crush on her, but it wasn't until the spring semester that we started hanging out at all. I'll admit I was kind of pathetic, tagging along with her, but whatever. I never claimed to be cool.

Anyway, I finally get invited to a party she's going to, and I'm like cool, maybe I can be smooth and hit her up while we're there. I offer to drive but she tells me she'll meet me there. I know, I'm lame, whatever. I show up and kind of hang out for a bit, it takes me a few minutes to find her and we chat for a few minutes, then she disappears. Like, she's gone. We're at someone's house I don't know and there's a ton of people there, and I have no clue what happened to this girl.

Eventually I wind up in a spare bedroom where some people were watching one of the Fast & Furious movies (I can't remember which one, maybe number 4?) so I sit down on the couch and watch the movie. I don't know anyone else, I can't find Samantha, but I have a beer and a movie so whatever, I'll enjoy myself.

After a while she finally reappears, and she's basically supporting this other girl I don't know. When she sees me, she gets all excited and I think that's great news, except she just dumps the girl next to me and tells me ""she's in a k hole, you gotta watch her."" (At the time I didn't know what that meant. I still only kind of know.) I figure the girl was drunk or something, so I'm like ""Hey wanna sit down and watch the movie with me?"" and Samantha says yeah I'll be right back and bounces.

Eventually the movie is over and she's never come back, so I get up and go look for her. Again, I can't find her. No idea where this chick went. I spend like fifteen minutes looking for her and nobody can tell me where she is. By this time it's late and I'm cranky so I leave.

A couple of days later, I get an angry text from Samantha saying that ""some guy touched (her friend)"" and that I was supposed to have been watching her. I told her that wasn't my job but she just said it doesn't matter, her friend was a woman and unable to protect herself and as a man I should have watched over her and now she's been ""violated."" I was still pissed about being ditched so I stopped replying pretty quickly. The one good thing about this is that I'm over my crush haha

So anyway, some of my friends think I should have watched the girl because she was in a dangerous place (there were a lot of people taking pills there, which I'm not into, which also made me further uncomfortable) and some of my friends say it was Samantha's responsibility.

85,1efu9qm,AITA for taking the money from selling my grandparents‚Äô home and not sharing with my cousins?,"I (25F) have an older brother (26M), it‚Äôs just the two of us, no other siblings. My mother is the oldest of two kids, she‚Äôs got a younger brother who is a deadbeat father to his 6 kids. When my grandparents were alive, they bought a big house (7 bedrooms with a lake view) in the 1970s, but my grandfather only paid the 5k down payment before he had to quit his job due to a sudden stroke. My mom took up the responsibility of paying for the house AND paying for my grandpa‚Äôs medical expenses. My grandmother was a SAHW and unemployed. My mom worked part time while working towards getting a degree and landed a great job with amazing perks (grandpa got medical insurance from mom‚Äôs job). My uncle got my aunt pregnant at 17 and continued to have 6 more kids in 12 years before cheating on her, divorcing her and marrying the mistress. My aunt was a poor girl with no support from her family, my grandma took pity and asked her and my cousins to move in. My mother continued to be the one to pay the bills, mortgage, kids basic needs and insurance. Aunt never offered to pay even when her dad died and left her a sum of money.

Yet no one in the past decade has ever contributed to the upkeep and bills. Granted 5 of them have moved out but my aunt and her youngest still lives there. 

Now comes to the problem, since both my grandparents have passed, mom wants to sell.

And that their mom and sibling have to find someplace else to live, to which my mom suggested them to live with the oldest since she just bought a 4 bedroom home.

My mom initially, out of the goodness of her heart wanted to give them a cut but because they were being rude and causing problems, she wants to take the whole profit and put it in my brother‚Äôs and I‚Äôs trust funds. They found this out when one of them (who was still in my mom‚Äôs good graces) were visiting our home and ‚Äòfound‚Äô the paperwork on her desk. My mom is a neat and tidiest person I know, she doesn‚Äôt leave anything on her desk, that cousin must have SEARCHED for it.

",Not the A-hole,2024-07-30,"AITA for taking the money from selling my grandparents‚Äô home and not sharing with my cousins? I (25F) have an older brother (26M), it‚Äôs just the two of us, no other siblings. My mother is the oldest of two kids, she‚Äôs got a younger brother who is a deadbeat father to his 6 kids. When my grandparents were alive, they bought a big house (7 bedrooms with a lake view) in the 1970s, but my grandfather only paid the 5k down payment before he had to quit his job due to a sudden stroke. My mom took up the responsibility of paying for the house AND paying for my grandpa‚Äôs medical expenses. My grandmother was a SAHW and unemployed. My mom worked part time while working towards getting a degree and landed a great job with amazing perks (grandpa got medical insurance from mom‚Äôs job). My uncle got my aunt pregnant at 17 and continued to have 6 more kids in 12 years before cheating on her, divorcing her and marrying the mistress. My aunt was a poor girl with no support from her family, my grandma took pity and asked her and my cousins to move in. My mother continued to be the one to pay the bills, mortgage, kids basic needs and insurance. Aunt never offered to pay even when her dad died and left her a sum of money. Uncle only came back home when he wanted money from my grandma. The kids are now adults (all older than me now) and 4/6 of them have good jobs.

86,1eftunm,AITA for telling a parent that their kid is weird when she pushed as to why my kid didn‚Äôt want to be her friend.,"My family and I have moved states. It has been a hard move especially for my oldest daughter Katty. She is in 6th grade. The areas school district has a Facebook account that parents are a part of. I introduced myself on there a while ago.


We put katty on the cross country team and she has been making friends over the summer. I got a message from a parent last week, asking to met up and let the kids met. They would be in the same grade and I thought it would be a good opportunity. 

We went yesterday at the local pool. I met Melanie and she wouldn‚Äôt make eye contact, was very soft spoken and overall didn‚Äôt seem to be paying attention. The kids were playing while I talked to the mom. She has always been in the area and was excited her kid was getting a friend. 

Katty came up to me asking to leave since she wasn‚Äôt feeling well. We left early and in the car she admitted to just wanting to get away from Melanie. She explained that    Melanie freaked her out. She was very touchy, kept pushing her in the water, was whispering ( saying things under her breath), would stare at people and make comments (comparing people to bugs? I am still confused on what that means) Katty told me she was uncomfortable and doesn‚Äôt want to hang out with her again.


The parent messaged me, and asked when they could do it again. I told her the girls didn‚Äôt mesh well and that we will have to decline. She then called me asking what I meant. I told her that katty wasn‚Äôt interested in hanging out since they don‚Äôt mesh together. I was trying to be polite about it.

This went on for a while and she told me that they kids just needed to be around eachother more. I told her no to that. It‚Äôs went on for a while, she asked to talk to my husband which is when I snapped.

I told her, no and that I was trying to be polite but your kid is weird. Melanie makes my kid uncomfortable and I don‚Äôt know what the hell is up with her but we will not have another play date.

She went on Facebook and it going around about how the new family are jerks.

87,1eftr4i,WIBTA for calling someone who doesn't want to speak to me?,"I (13f) and my former friend ""R"" (15NB) used to have romantic history. They soon realised they had trauma and weren't ready for a relationship, but we ended up going on a date. They asked to kiss me, but I turned them down despite liking them. For a short time, we tried to keep the friendship going, but apparently they felt guilty about the date and stopped talking to me for unknown reasons. (At one point, I had learned they have a habit of cutting contact with people based on their own insecurities.) Soon after, I learned from a mutual friend ""L"" (14m) that they'd told him a flipped version of the story, in which I had tried to kiss them and they had backed out.

After more ignoring, my best friend (13NB) helped me rekindle the friendship. R was glad that they had come to terms with and healed from their previous trauma. I asked R about the story I heard from L, and they promised that wasn't what they said and they didn't know what happened. Although I didn't believe them, I decided to forgive and forget on the condition that they talked to L to tell him the real story. For a while after that, we had a close friendship, and I began to develop feelings again.

However, when I invited L over, I learned that he still thought I had tried to kiss R and my feelings were unrequited. Later, I texted R to ask about it again, and they insisted they didn't know what happened and they had already talked to L about it. I did not believe them, and said I had to ask again, because I was inclined to believe they did know where L had gained his misconceptions. They left that message on read, and I deleted it because I felt bad.

The next morning, I texted to apologize for assuming they were lying without considering they could have just forgotten, and they did not read it. I suspected they were ignoring me again, and so a week after that, I texted them again to make sure. After another week of ignoring, I reached out to my cousin K (20f) for advice on how to fix the situation, and she thought my ex was not considering my feelings, that shutting down contact was rude and borderline manipulative, and that I wasn't in the wrong for not blindly trusting them after hearing they'd told stories behind my back. She advised me to firmly ask for an explanation and not to apologize.

I asked L to tell R that ""as this may be the last time I speak to them, I am deeply saddened and disappointed that I have been left no choice but to use a friend as a messenger, and that I truly want to clear up and address any issues between them and I for both of our closure. We may decide where to go from there, but if they continue to ignore me, I will not be reaching out again."" He thought they wouldn't respond well, but agreed to send a politer version of my message anyway.

No response has come, and I said I wouldn't reach out again, but I am dissatisfied and want an explanation. AITA for assuming they were lying, and WIBTA if I called them to ask them to explain themselves when they've made it clear they don't want to speak to me?

88,1eftmnb,AITA for being angry that my parents paid for everything for my siblings but nothing for me? ,"I‚Äôm 26m and I am the second oldest of four. Growing up money was tight and my parents were always worried about bills. When I would ask for something as a child that didn‚Äôt understand money I was met with ‚ÄúIs it your birthday? Do you have a job? Then no.‚Äù As I grew older I figured I was hurting my parents by asking so I stopped. 

When my brother came of age to go to college my dad gave him the GI Bill to cover his expenses. He squandered it. Partying hard and hardly ever going to class. He ended up scraping by and getting a useless degree he doesn‚Äôt use. The same year he graduated I finished highschool and was told I was on my own for college. I started going to a community college and worked a blue collar job to support myself but realized that to get the degree I was aiming for (Mech Engineering) I‚Äôd still have to spent 4 years at a university. All I was doing was lightening my first couple of semesters course load. So I transferred to the local state university and applied for loans but because of my Dad being a high earner I couldn‚Äôt get enough to pay for everything. So I worked full time as a waiter/bartender while taking a full course load for engineering. This where things got really tough. 

I‚Äôd regularly sleep around 3-5 hours a night and eat buttered noodles for lunch and dinner to make ends meet. I was barley making things work with funds and school, scraping by in my classes and sometimes paying rent a week late. I relayed all of this to my parents and to their credit they sometimes sent me 100 dollars to go get some groceries. The final nail in my school coffin though came in 2022 when I crashed my car after falling asleep at the wheel at 4pm on my way to my job after class. I knew I couldn‚Äôt keep this up so I dropped out of college halfway through my junior year. 

As this was happening my younger sister (we‚Äôll call her Angie) started to go to college herself. I called her up and tried to give her some advice on working and studying but she then told me that our parents were footing the entire bill for a PRIVATE college and got her a newer model car to go with. I was furious but tired to rationalize it in my head due to the fact that Angie is honest to go an angel. She‚Äôs hardworking, sweet and super respectful. So I thought that she deserved to not struggle and buried my feeling about the matter as I looked into different ways to pay for school and finish my degree. 

As I was working full time however, my youngest sister (we‚Äôll call her Debbie) has now came of age to go to school and is being offered the same opportunity that I was not. And this time, there isn‚Äôt any excuse. She‚Äôs spoiled, rotten, manipulative, and selfish. For example when offered the opportunity the ONLY thing was that she had to go to the same private college as Angie. She freaks out because her boyfriend is going to a different college and wants to go with him. She yells at my parents calling them all kinds of things I would never had thought to say when I was living with them and says her life isn‚Äôt fair. This is too much for me as I am visiting home at the time of the argument. I tell her that she should be extremely grateful that she doesn‚Äôt have to work and try to go to school because it is almost impossible depending on what you want to do. She then says the following ‚ÄúI could do it, I‚Äôm not like you.‚Äù This is where I blew a gasket. I yelled that she didn‚Äôt even understand the word ‚Äúwork‚Äù because everything has been handed on a silver platter and unlike every other child I had to work my ass off to even get close to succeeding. She didn‚Äôt listen to me at all, cried, said I was being mean to her and ran upstairs. 

My parents comforted her and are still buying her a newer car and paying for a useless degree (graphic design) that going to be taken over by Ai in a couple years.

89,1eft7bv,"AITA? (F25) Moving day, featuring upset neighbor (F50s)","Good morning! Just woke up, and cannot get this situation from yesterday out of my head.
Myself and my roommate just moved to a 1 b 1 b in a high rise community of condos. We're both 25, are renting this one unit from a dude who owns just the one unit. We were given a thick binder of rules for living here. 

We scheduled our move from 1 to 4 yesterday, by 1) notifying the unit owner, 2) submitting signed paperwork and a $500 move in deposit to the Condo people 2 weeks ago, and 3) confirming with the condo manager (Robert) via email Monday morning before the start of the move. We also met with the handyman (Andrew) at about 1:30 when our first uhaul load came.

There are two elevators for this new building- a regular one and a freight one. We were using the freight one to move in, taking stuff up one elevator load at a time. There weren't any signs posted that we were moving, but I had read in the binder that people had to use the freight elevator for letting dogs or bikes outside, and several neighbors did come down the elevator in between our loads, so I figured this was because we didn't have the right to hog the elevator that whole block of time.

A neighbor (F50s) came at us hot about 1:50. We had done several loads from 1:30 to 1:50, and I guess she had been trying to call the freight elevator to take down her laundry basket (also technically not supposed to be in the regular elevator). My roommate and I were upstairs and she came in hot at my (M50s) father downstairs who was staging things. 

(F50s) ""Does the property manager know about this?"" 

(My dad) ""Yes, they confirmed with Robert this morning, and Andrew the maintenance man showed us where to put the uhaul, but I'm her father, she'll be right down‚Äî"" 

(F50s) ""No, Robert wouldn't have done this. There are fines for this! There are things that had to happen before this happens! We were not notified!""

Etc, etc. My dad works for Walmart as a manager and went into work mode, active listening and trying to keep her calm.

Here's the ""am I the asshole"" part. I got down there, she repeated how this is awful for her, I said I was sorry and stopped talking, kept moving my things. I'm a teacher and I'm very patient with kids, but I don't have a lot of patience for adults who have clearly made up their minds about a situation. I could've shown her emails confirming we did book our move the right way, could've shown her the receipt for the move deposit. Could've repeated what my dad already told her.

But in that moment, sweaty and exhausted and stressed about a rain storm coming down on everything I own, I just said ""well I'm sorry."" And stared at her while she ranted and left when I didn't engage.

My roommate saw her again later in the regular elevator.

90,1eft510,AITA for refusing to drive my bf‚Äôs car?,"Back in February my (f19) Boyfriend (m19)  asked me to go on a 4-day Car-convention/festival with him. The tickets cost a 100 bucks and i was hesitant, since i don‚Äôt care for cars, but in the end decided to get a ticket, as i could still sell it before the event, in case I decided not to go. The event would be a days drive, and i was fine with switching to drive if we drove with one of our two available family cars.

A month or two later, he bought himself a vintage car, he‚Äôs really proud of it, as it is his first car, but it has a lot of flaws: one window doesn‚Äôt open, no AC, air filter problems, water leaks inside from the roof etc. 
Personally, i like the car, it‚Äôs cute. But im really annoyed with it, as more and more issues arise as time goes on.

Here‚Äôs the problem and where i may be the asshole:

Two weeks ago she tells me she is looking for her own place. I tell her i am very happy for her because that seems like a sensible decision, but i am very sad to see her leave of course. 

I have a huge couch which takes up a lot of the living room space. When she moved in we discussed selling it and me buying a smaller one, but we never did. 

I have my eyes on a new smaller couch which would fit perfectly. I listed the old couch on Marketplace, just to kinda see what it is worth.

 On the ride there my husband explained if his father makes it out, that his dad will probably sell his property that is in shambles and live out the rest of his life in an apartment or home in town.

95,1efsf3l,AITA for inviting my boyfriend‚Äôs sister to a concert? ,"Boyfriend (26,F) & I (23,f) we‚Äôve been together for 2 yrs

All of this started about a week ago when one of the biggest superstar‚Äôs concert tickets went live for presale. 

Where we live, you cannot bulk buy tickets so I bought 3 tickets (1 each for my sister, boyfriend & myself) and asked my friends to buy for themselves. 

I asked Michelle (32,F- boyfriend‚Äôs sister) if she wanted to go as well - because I know how much she loves this artist as well and my sister was going as well and so was another friend‚Äôs cousin. 

(Info: Michelle got married in March 2024 and all of our friends going to the concert were also invited. We all had a blast and all became friendly) 

So I didn‚Äôt think too much and asked if she‚Äôd like to go as well and she was elated and agreed. I told my boyfriend and he instantly got mad at me as to why I asked her and I told him - because my sister is going, our friends cousin is also coming so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an issue that Michelle comes too. And she loves this artist. 
He got mad about it and didn‚Äôt talk to me. He decided that he won‚Äôt go to the concert now. When he did talk to him, he completely avoided this topic. 
 

My mistake: I didn‚Äôt reply to his sister for a day after he got mad at me. 

After that, she texted me saying she doesn‚Äôt want to come and that her brother might not be comfortable with her coming.

We spoke about it and I kinda told her that he was mad at me for bypassing him and directly asking her and now they‚Äôve had a fight last night about it. 

I did tell her this only on the basis that she doesn‚Äôt tell him that we discussed this. I feel betrayed by Michelle on telling him. I know she was upset with her brother but now I‚Äôm the bad guy who discussed her bf with his sister. He was super cruel to me.

I grew up VERY poor, and it was only until my early 30s start i started making okay money. Until then I had never been on a holiday or a vacation, the concept is foreign to me. I have a lot of hobbies, guitar, archery, wargames, laser tag and cooking. My wife, Lucy, of three years is not an avid traveler, but she has been to Thailand, New Zealand and Colorado. 

  
She proposed that we go to Thailand for a two week vacation. Now if I go somewhere out of my regular zone, it needs to be for something very specific, just going to somewhere and wandering does -nothing- for me. There has to be a goal in mind. When she proposed I got nervous, I knew that just going to a place for the sake of going there would be boring for me. Her itinerary was mostly go to different cities and see the sites. At the time i trusted that she would find something for me as she is much better travelled than I am and knows me (I should have suggested a food tour in hindsight).

So we went, visited a few cities and towns, I ate as much as I could from whatever dodgy street vendor I could find. And we went back home. Problem is I remember sweet fuck all about it. I didnt really enjoy it, it was just a louder Victoria with more Thai people. I didn't complain, I put on my best face and got through it because it was important to her.

The problem arose when we went out to dinner with friends. One asked me what my favorite parts of the trip were, I just said the food, and my wife asked me what my favorite city was. I froze, I couldnt remember any of the names, and I said Pattaya (my coworker goes there).....we didn't go to Pattaya.

This upset my wife. On the way back home she ripped into me and said I didnt appreciate how much effort she put into the trip, why can't I remember something this important.

98,1efrx14,WIBTA if I decided not to go on a family vacation last minute?,"The vacation is the *same* one we take every single year since 2013. It's actually my husband's family and friends of like 30ish people that go, and over the years I have invited my own parents, to the point where my dad makes plans to go even without me. 

It's an island fishing camp. Since it happens every year, some people commit to *not* going at the beginning of the year, but because my partner and I are such creatures of habit, we didn't even consider an alternative.

But this is the last week before the vacation and the logistics of trying to find multiple cat sitters made me realize I would rather be 'forced' to stay home to watch the cats. Alas in the end I did find multiple people willing to do it, now the thought has been incepted that I don't really want to go. 

I had also invited two of my own friends to come with us this year, and they bailed a month or two ago, so I think that was the novelty that I was actually looking forward to. 

Whether or not I go doesn't affect anything else logistically. 

I simply feel guilty for deciding so late, my mom might be really disappointed and even get upset because she would have cancelled if I didn't go but it's 'too late' now. 

The reasons I don't want to go are simply that there is a LOT of downtime where half the group is out fishing, I don't fish, there's no internet, it's too cold to swim for most of the day, etc. I'm just struggling to find something that I want to do all day everyday there to fill my time. At least if I'm bored at home, I can go be productive and deep clean the house or do a project. I'd also be saving myself $450.

The reason I might have FOMO is I do actually like my family, I could miss out on some laughs and bonding, but it feels like all these vacations are becoming less and less memorable over the years.

It's actually my husband's family and friends of like 30ish people that go, and over the years I have invited my own parents, to the point where my dad makes plans to go even without me. 

It's an island fishing camp. Since it happens every year, some people commit to *not* going at the beginning of the year, but because my partner and I are such creatures of habit, we didn't even consider an alternative.

But this is the last week before the vacation and the logistics of trying to find multiple cat sitters made me realize I would rather be 'forced' to stay home to watch the cats. Alas in the end I did find multiple people willing to do it, now the thought has been incepted that I don't really want to go. 

I had also invited two of my own friends to come with us this year, and they bailed a month or two ago, so I think that was the novelty that I was actually looking forward to. 

Whether or not I go doesn't affect anything else logistically. 

I simply feel guilty for deciding so late, my mom might be really disappointed and even get upset because she would have cancelled if I didn't go but it's 'too late' now. 

The reasons I don't want to go are simply that there is a LOT of downtime where half the group is out fishing, I don't fish, there's no internet, it's too cold to swim for most of the day, etc. I'm just struggling to find something that I want to do all day everyday there to fill my time. At least if I'm bored at home, I can go be productive and deep clean the house or do a project. I'd also be saving myself $450.

The reason I might have FOMO is I do actually like my family, I could miss out on some laughs and bonding, but it feels like all these vacations are becoming less and less memorable over the years.

So ultimately, would I be the asshole to not going on a vacation last minute simply because I don't feel like it?",0.0,0.09804041683673859,0,1

100,1efrhw8,AITA for getting angry about my cousin‚Äôs short notice on 1-week stay over ,"Context: My cousin and I are living overseas. He was  having a long holiday back in our home country (let‚Äôs called it A) before enrolling in the university in country B where I live. The university lessons usually start around mid Aug but he decided to fly over 2 weeks earlier for some student-organised activities. His dormitory room is only available one week before school starts, so there is one week gap between his arrival and dorm room being available and he didn‚Äôt even plan for any accommodations during this one week gap.

The issue: At midnight, a few hours before his flight, he texted me asking if I can let him stay over at my place for a week until his dorm is available. I only saw the text next morning. 

I got super angry because (1) He took me for granted, didn‚Äôt even bother to inform me before hand, gave me such short notice, forcing me to say ‚Äúyes‚Äù I suppose (2) It‚Äôs A WEEK stay. I can accept if it‚Äôs just one night crash. But one week? (3) He could have booked his flight to match dormitory availability but he chose fun and caused me inconvenience instead.

What‚Äôs worse? The rest of the family (my grandparents and his parents) said that I‚Äôm being an ass for getting angry like that. All I did was asking in the family group chat ‚ÄúWhy did you not tell me earlier?‚Äù. And they didn‚Äôt even give me a reason. They all laughed it off like a joke. This made me feel even angrier. I actually scolded him and let him know that this is not okay and if he ever does that again, I will let him sleep on the street. He apologised and said that he forgot to inform me earlier (but like bitch, what is your mind so occupied with for you to forget about accommodations, the most important thing when going overseas?).

Once people's birthdays started, we started doing more and more until by April it was a 4-day party with people vying for the honor of hosting. (I was always one of the ones pushing to do more, spend a little more, host with better food and drinks, leave more personal birthday wishes, etc.)

One other teacher and I have the same summer birthday. We knew we wouldn't get the royal treatment but we assumed someone would spearhead a pre- or post-summer party for us. We didn't think about it much, but I do care, and I'm torn whether I'm keeping score unfairly. Some of us stayed in Europe this summer, and some flew back to the US (I stayed).

Besides a few messages (""hey, aren't your birthdays this week?""), there wasn't much fanfare, and the one person who didn't say anything besides hearting other messages and sending a mass text saying ""I love you all SO MUCH and yes I am very stoned right now"" is a woman (let's call her Sue) who is very loving when drunk but who otherwise floods the chat with memes and dog pics and apologizes for all of her insecurities, which are myriad, often endearing, and very well known to the group.

BTW Sue's partner has done a lot of handyman work for me and I always overpay because they don't have much money on one income and because Sue's partner does excellent work.

Sue then invited us to her house tonight for a potluck, joking that she can't back out of this one if she's hosting.

107,1efolo7,AITA for allowing locked out AirBnb guest to walk across my neighbours terrace to enter their apartment? (now getting threatened with Police). ,"Late last night, around midnight, I was lying in bed, about to fall asleep with my girlfriend, when I heard a knock on my door.   
  
For context, I live on the third floor of an apartment complex with three apartments on each floor. My apartment is the furthest from the stairs, followed by my neighbor, an early middle-aged (?) woman who lives alone and is someone I've had a friendly relationship with for the past three years. 

The third apartment is now rented out as an Airbnb by the owner.

I opened the door to find two young guys in their early twenties. They claimed they had been locked out of the Airbnb and wondered if they could cross into their place by going through my apartment and my neighbor's terrace. 

Our terraces are connected, only separated by a small fence. They said my neighbor wasn't answering (which was reasonable, given the late hour), the landlord wasn't responding, and they were essentially out of options.

Long story short, I checked their Airbnb booking and photos they had taken of the place to ensure they were actually living there. Feeling confident they were indeed guests of the Airbnb, I let them enter my apartment and then cross through my neighbor's terrace to theirs. 

My rationale was that they clearly lived there, they'd be on my neighbor's terrace for just a minute, and this way, they wouldn't have to stay out all night waiting to hear back from the Airbnb host.

This morning, I received a text from my neighbor asking what had happened the previous night. 

She mentioned hearing the knocking and some conversation from the hallway. She also said she saw her terrace light go on at night. 

I explained what had happened and preemptively apologized for letting someone onto her terrace without her knowledge. Explaining I thought it was the most resonable thing to do given the circumstances.

She did not agree. 

She sent me a long text about how dangerous my decision was, how she found footsteps on her terrace and water pump in the morning, and how I showed extremely poor judgment. 

She now also mentioned that she plans to file a police report. 

Honestly, I was torn when allowing them through, so I can also understand why she's upset. However, I think filing a police report (I'm not even sure if it's against me, the Airbnb tenants, or both parties) is escalating things way too much.

So, I come here seeking the online verdict: AITA in this situation?

Of course also friends visit my booth to say hello, but they usually don't stay long to not prevent me from talking to customers.

Especially in the afternoons/evenings i get tired so i don't talk that much to friends anymore (they mostly notice i'm tired and tell me they won't bother me any longer). on the second day shortly befor closing time, a group of friends and people i know came by. i stood up from my chair and waved hello and had a short talk. one of them wanted to come behind the booth to hug me but that's not really allowed and we'd have to move things from the booth next to mine so i told her to please stay in the front. She seemed to understand and just stood there next to her boyfriend not seeming very interested in my items. I sat back down and talked to some customers while my friends left.

A few weeks ago i met that girl who i didn't allow to come behind the booth in the city while grocery shopping and she actually complained to me, that she was very disappointed that i just ""ignored"" them.

109,1efoa78,AITA for the way I handled the family dinner?,"For starters, I have a terrible relationship with everyone in my family, except for my mother who is the only one who I ever had contact with.

So, when my mother passed away two weeks ago, it was like a hit in the gut for me because of two reasons: 1) She was the only one in my family who ever treated me with respect, and I felt bad for not realizing something was wrong sooner. And 2) Because one of my relatives basically stole my mother‚Äôs phone (for horrible reasons, at first) to tell me since I‚Äôve blocked all of my extended family. 

And because it‚Äôs my mother‚Äôs funeral, and she‚Äôs the only one in my family who I love, of course I had to go. Even if I hated my extended family.

And I was already annoyed before the dinner because of how my family was loudly nagging me and my husband for ‚Äúnews‚Äù (aka gossip) and being disruptive and rude, instead of just letting us mourn my mother in peace DURING the wake.

For context, one of the things that I know is a horrible ‚Äútradition‚Äù is to force the richest person in the family pay for the bill. Which, of course, was me and my husband.

So when we were having dinner, I was already annoyed that my family insisted on ordering the MOST EXPENSIVE items on the menu, because me and my ‚Äúrich husband‚Äù can pay for it, since ‚Äúmoney is no issue for us.‚Äù But what pissed me off is how my cousin‚Äôs CHILDREN were treating me.

Which was that their children would snatch any dish ordered for me and my husband, and gobbled down OUR meal while giving me those shit-eating grin. While their parents laughed at how ‚Äúspunky‚Äù their children were being.

And when me and my husband tried to tell them off for being rude, we were told not to ‚Äúyell at their children‚Äù because we were not their parents. And then when we tried to tell THEIR PARENTS off for not teaching their children to behave better, they ‚Äútold us off‚Äù by telling us that we were being ‚Äútoo sensitive.‚Äù Along with comments that they expected childless couples like us to as selfish as we are.

And this is where I am the AH. Because after being hangry for too long, I snapped and ask my husband to grab a trash can so that I can basically dump all of the expensive food down the trash, including the children‚Äôs dishes as well. And I was yelling at them by saying that if we can‚Äôt eat then no one can. And my husband was all too happy to help me. 

And then I continued to snap at them by stating that me and my husband were not paying for the dinner, and someone else can, since ‚Äúmoney is no issue for them‚Äù when they were trying to get me to pay the dinner bill as punishment for ruining the dinner and making the children cry. While also arguing back with my family stating that they were just being too sensitive when they were calling me unreasonable.

110,1efoa2l,AITA for telling my mom she was the naive one who expected her husband's son to magically change?,"I (22m) was born deaf and was never a candidate for hearing aids. I was taught ASL and my mom and others in my family learned ASL too. This is the only way I could ever speak or be spoken to. I don't lip read or anything like that. My dad wasn't in my life ever. And when I was 9 my mom started dating Tom. Tom had a 10 year old son, Cole, at the time. It was pretty clear from the start that Cole was unenthusiastic about us and had no interest in learning ASL to speak to me. Tom and mom decided we should all take ""family"" ASL classes and learn together in a fun environment, which the classes they found were. Cole had to be dragged and he didn't take part willingly or eagerly. If anything he'd intentionally do things wrong and make himself do worse than he would have naturally so he was asked less.

He did eventually take them seriously. My mom believed it was because he had really bonded with me and now gave a crap about communicating with me. But that wasn't it. He had a knew kid in school he wanted to talk to who was also deaf. The new guy was his motivation for learning. Cole and I never talked enough for him to be motivated to learn and he made lots of mistakes when talking to me but I noticed his ASL was perfect with his friend.

It always felt weird living with someone who didn't want me around. My mom and Tom believed we'd blended eventually. I think there was some fight when Cole turned 17 and my mom and Tom wanted to go away for a weekend. I remember everyone looked so tense one morning and I was told I'd be going to stay with my grandparents for the weekend since it wasn't a great idea to leave me home alone when I couldn't hear if something was wrong. My assumption is they wanted Cole to keep an eye on me and make sure I was okay and he let them know he really didn't care what happened to me.

Cole and I haven't seen each other since he moved out. My mom has asked a few times if we've met up or whatever and I'm always honest and say no. She finally asked me two or three weeks ago if things were good between Cole and me and I told her she had to have picked up on the fact he never wanted us around and wasn't interested in being good between him and me. She said she really believed that had changed once we got closer and she brought up how he took ASL more seriously. I told her it was clearly for his friend. Not me. She was clearly shocked. But brought it up again over the weekend and she told me she thought I was very naive to think Cole didn't learn ASL for both and that him being resistant at first didn't mean he didn't grow to love me. I told her she was the naive one to expect him to magically change out of nowhere. I told her if she wanted to be married to Tom that badly, it's fine. But she should accept it wasn't so perfect for me and her claiming I'm naive about Cole shows how much she wants to overlook. Mom was not cool with what I said to her.

She adores and respect Gwen a lot, I'm not sure if its the age difference, but I am almost convinced that she would give her the world if she could. Anyway, my friend does not like that my partner and I make jokes about her Gwen, specifically jokes about her liking younger guys. Now I don't know the exact age range of guys that Gwen is into, but my partner and I find the idea a little odd. 

We all hang out almost weekly, and my friend would share about her work day which sometimes Gwen would be included into the conversation. My friend talks about Gwen quite a bit, and sometimes we all joke light-heartedly about her, including her interest in younger guys, which my friend has thought was funny in the past.

We have a group chat where we share funny and relatable things with each other. Today I shared an Instagram reel that I found which was a girl singing about how she is into younger guys and that age is just a number. Immediately I thought about Gwen and shared it into the group chat and made a comment that I found the song made for Gwen. My friend responds back that she did not want to participate in jokes about Gwen as she is a good friend and respects her. Basically letting us know to not tell jokes about Gwen to her even though she acknowledge that it is harmless joking. She explains further that she feels like she is betraying Gwen due to joking behind her back. I was a bit confused because I didn't talk bad about Gwen, I just shared a funny video about Gwen liking younger guys which is a fact. Lastly, she expressed that she is uncomfortable with it and I haven't responded back since I am not sure what to say. 

I think my friend's response is related to the weird conversation that she had with Gwen. Basically my friend bumped into her co-worker at the store who was shopping with a mutual friend of Gwen. My friend's co-worker introduced them and they had a brief conversation. My friend later brought up to Gwen about this encounter, but Gwen simply responds back that she doesn't like small world and then my friend changed the topic. 

I feel like because of that encounter, my friend is afraid that our joking in the group chat will somehow lead to Gwen and cause her to be upset therefore she will lose her forever. I also recall my friend saying that because Gwen is so great, she doesn't want to say anything that might offend her. 

A part of me wants to respect my friends wishes and boundaries, but I also feel like I would be doing it for the wrong reasons.

112,1efo3xr,AITA for running away from home ,"


I'm 19 and live in a country where you are expected to heavily respect your elders, but it can be hard with my grandmother. My grandmother has treated me harshly ever since I was a child. She makes me wash her hands after I cook her an entire meal, then she makes me bring a tray of tea. Five minutes later, she makes me do it again. I am told that at her home, she is fully capable of doing everything by herself, and I noticed that she only does this to me. When I was younger, I would cry every night because I lived with her, and she would always find a way to hurt me emotionally. I remember being 9 and having a sleepover, and she called me and my friend ""ladies of the night"" due to our behavior. She has always made me come into her room at night because she wants me to pray for her. Last night, I did it, and she said she didn't like my prayer and made me pray again. I did it again and told her, ""Let's invite my brother to our prayer sessions tomorrow,"" just to see if she would force him to pray the same way she forces me.

A few weeks ago, she came again, and I was traumatized and begged my close friend to drop me off at my other family member's home when we were out instead of coming home to my grandma. She also judges the clothes I wear and only compliments me if I'm wearing attire that covers my feet. She makes me do things I don't agree with, then forces me to accept them and acts as if I know nothing. I did tell my family, and they said that's how she is, but I am getting tired. Last time, she screamed at me for not getting dressed early, but she kept sending me on errands which she didn't want to do by herself and acted as if I was completely irresponsible. So, am I right for not wanting to be home when she's around because I still have trauma, or does this make me a bad granddaughter?

I'm 19 and live in a country where you are expected to heavily respect your elders, but it can be hard with my grandmother. My grandmother has treated me harshly ever since I was a child. She makes me wash her hands after I cook her an entire meal, then she makes me bring a tray of tea. Five minutes later, she makes me do it again. I am told that at her home, she is fully capable of doing everything by herself, and I noticed that she only does this to me. When I was younger, I would cry every night because I lived with her, and she would always find a way to hurt me emotionally. I remember being 9 and having a sleepover, and she called me and my friend ""ladies of the night"" due to our behavior. She has always made me come into her room at night because she wants me to pray for her. Last night, I did it, and she said she didn't like my prayer and made me pray again. I did it again and told her, ""Let's invite my brother to our prayer sessions tomorrow,"" just to see if she would force him to pray the same way she forces me. She's only at our home right now because my aunt is coming into the country. She told me she liked me because I'm, in her words, ""a child you can hurt a million times, and they let it go.""

114,1efnwyz,AITA for not letting my little brother DJ my girlfriend's birthday party?,"I've been planning a big surprise birthday party for my girlfriend, involving both our families and our friends.

My family's been helping me with some things like helping set up the decorations and everything. My little brother is 12 and he offered to let me use his bluetooth radio. Originally, i didn't plan on having music since it took place in the park, but i felt it'd be a nice addition. 

So i put a playlist together. I spent awhile on the playlist cause i wanted it to be personal (over 2 hours), i didn't just use some generic YT Mix, i handpicked the songs myself. Based on her music tastes, songs i thought fit parties and i had a song i added so we could slow dance to them as a surprise.

And after all that work of putting this together, he takes back the offer. He was disappointed cause he wanted to be the one to DJ the party. Mom took his side and said he wants to feel involved in the party. But i'm letting him pick out some of the decor and he got to pick out his own card to give her. I just feel like since she's my girlfriend, i should have final word over the music played. But mom said it's his radio and he can just take it back. I tried to compromise by letting him choose some songs but he refused. ""How do i know you'll actually put them on the playlist?"".

I planned on having it play passively in the background on shuffle. He wants to do the playlist from his phone and act as the DJ.  The playlist itself is a little long because i wanted it to be as varied as possible. So the songs he added might be lost in the shuffle. The songs he wants to add are mostly songs he just likes and don't really fit what i'm going for. So they don't get lost in the shuffle, i'd either have to cut out some of her song choices or add more of his choices to guarantee they show up  Or lose the radio. Plus she hates rap and heavy metal, which he loves and i don't know if i can trust him to not play that stuff.

It was important that i do it from my phone so i can have that special moment where me and her slow dance. I know the song i wanted to use and wanted to have quick access to it (It's top of the list and i can click it right away). If he had it, i'd have to ask him to play it and hope he does the right one. I can do it subtly by just taking my phone and click that song when it's the perfect timing. So i can make that moment special.

He complains to our mom that i'm not letting him ""Be involved"", the only other thing i've refused on his letting him use a light the candles or cut the cake (Because i think a knife and lighter should only be used by an adult and not a 12 year old)

But mom doesn't see my side. She said ""You'll take his help but you won't let him be involved"". and ""That playlist is too long anyway, there's no reason you can't have room for him to pick some""

Mom believes that since it's his radio, he gets final say.

115,1efnphp,"AITA for getting angry over being accused of doing drugs?
","Throwaway account. So I (F25) have been dating my partner (M27) for two years, and we have had arguments before but nothing as stupid or big as this one. So a few days ago I went to go donate blood for the first time. I didn't think it was a big deal, and went about life regularly until last night, where I met up with my boyfriend for a nice dinner. It gets pretty warm where we live, so I wore a sleeveless dress and the start of our dinner went well.



I guess somewhere during the conversation, he noticed the needle marks that have yet to heal. I say needle marks because I have pretty small veins, and it took the nurse multiple times to poke me. He asked me what happened and I mentioned that I had donated blood recently. Both of our families have struggled with addiction, and we had told each other that we had no desire to follow down the same path, so I tried to be patient and understanding and reiterate that a local gym I go to had a blood drive and I decided to participate on a whim. 



Where I started to get annoyed was when he asked me for proof. The only thing that I had was a screenshot of the RapidPass qr code and the email that thanked me for donating blood. I showed that, and for good measure, said that I had multiple marks because they had trouble finding a vein. We continued dinner but I could tell that he was festering, and I was also annoyed myself. 



I still wanted to hang out with my boyfriend though and we drove over to his apartment and on the ride over the energy still felt weird, but I didn't know how angry he was til we walked through his door and he outright accused me of doing heroin. I yelled back that I showed him all the proof that I had but he said that just because I donated blood doesn't mean that I didn't also do drugs afterwards, which would explain the multiple needle marks, and plus I would have an ""alibi"" to tell him. He then went on a rant about how it takes one time for me to get addicted and that we had agreed to never do drugs, which I HADN'T but he was just livid and making assumptions. He then pointed out how I use PRESCRIBED MEDICATIONS FROM MY DOCTOR as proof that I had already started, which yeah, sometimes those medications can develop into addictions but I had always been careful about that. I didn't know that he had such an issue with even prescription medication but I found out the hard way last night. I couldn't handle it anymore and called him an asshole, which he parroted, and left. 



Now that it's the next day I'm getting radio silence from my boyfriend. No apology, no good morning text, nothing. I'm still pissed and don't want to apologize but I'm wondering if I went too far.



I shouldn't have went back to his place but we hadn't seen each other in a while and he has a cute dog, and I thought that if he brought up the topic it wouldn't have exploded. AITA?

I helped him start his career in a good industry, and I even helped him find his first job in that industry, along with giving him a room to stay in my house for the cost of the utilities.

During this time at work, things weren't going well for me. I really wasn't in a good mental state at the time. I admit I did bring a lot of that work unhappiness home, but I did my best to not take it out on my friend. A few times he asked me if I was mad about something, and the first few times, I tried to explain, but he would either get quiet and go ""yep"" every once in awhile or hijack the conversation to talk about his crew and work, so eventually I just stopped discussing it.

The last time he asked, I screwed up big time, and I said I didn't feel like he was the kind of friend I could discuss my problems with. I said it in a moment of frustration, but it came out a lot harsher than I expected. Later on, I tried to take him on an outing on the weekend on a far away city so I could apologize and talk in the car along the way, but at the last second, he said he ""wasnt feeling well,"" so I tried to have a talk with him in the house, but the other roomate (who I will call Chuck), jumped into the conversation and they both began airing their greivances about how I was a ""neat freak."" I got very frustrated and I told both of them that they didn't really have a right to dictate how I wanted my house and they were really only entitled to the rooms they were renting.

I don't think our relationship ever recovered from it. We chatted a few times after making up, and he said it was a close run thing, but I felt like it was over, and I feel like he felt it too, since his original plan was to stay a year, but he decided to leave early for another company. We were cordial to the day he left, I helped him pack his things and he even didn't return the full security deposit so I could hire junk removers to remove a lot of the stuff he left behind, which included a lot of the gifts I had given him over the years. We haven't called or texted each other since, which must be over 2 months by now.

I found out from a coworker that apparently, he said he didn't want to go to the outing because he wanted to see me ""fight"" for the relationship. At the time I found out about this, we already ""made up"" and he was already set to leave, so I never confronted him about it, even though I was really hurt by the fact that he clearly knew what I intentions were, and he should know as my friend of over a decade that I hate playing those sort of games.

119,1efmx3b,AITA for snapping at my MIL?,"(Sorry for bad English, it‚Äôs not my first language)

I, 24F, and my fianc√©e, 25m, have been engaged for a year and a half, together for 4.

The problem starts with his mother, (I‚Äôm gonna say MIL even though we aren‚Äôt married yet). MIL has never liked me and I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôve done, I‚Äôve always been so polite to her but she‚Äôs never liked me & made it obvious.

Me and fianc√©e started planning the wedding very soon after getting engaged: mainly just discussing ideas of what we would want, & since we are from different cultures, we were trying to think of ways to bring parts of both customs into our wedding (we can‚Äôt afford to have 2, like some of my relatives have had). 

MIL came over a week after we got engaged to ask about wedding plans. She mentioned having a ‚Äúwhite wedding,‚Äù (race, not colour) and said that bringing in traditions from my culture will ruin the weddings ‚Äúaesthetic‚Äù. I explained that we can still have it as aesthetic as everyone wants, but I want parts of my family‚Äôs traditions, as they will be there too. She scoffed and shrugged it off, which hurt a bit but I let it go. 

These past few months she had no interest in discussing the wedding with me, & completely ignored me through the whole thing.

I‚Äôve been looking at dresses, & I was starting to properly look into it, tried a few on, and she found out through fianc√©e. She immediately came to our house to tell me I must get a white dress, and any of that ‚Äúcultural bullsh¬°t‚Äù can stay out of it. I was fed up at this point, since she had been doing this the whole planning time; telling me I can‚Äôt have any cultural foods, traditions, music or anything for my side of the family. 

I yelled at her, and told her that ‚Äújust because your wedding never went through doesn‚Äôt mean you get to plan mine.‚Äù, (three months before her wedding with my fianc√©es dad, he run away and refused to get married to her.), And other hurtful things I regret. I went off for at least a minute, and didn‚Äôt stop, and my fianc√©e stayed quiet the whole time.

She left, angry, without saying anything except calling me a bitch, and made Facebook posts about me.

My siblings and I are from my dad's second wife. During a big war, my dad and his other wives left the city but didn‚Äôt take our mom. He claimed she didn‚Äôt want to leave, but that‚Äôs a lie.

Later, he took our two oldest siblings to where he moved, and they saw a life we couldn‚Äôt even imagine‚Äîbig houses with 24/7 electricity, water, and private education, while we had no electricity or proper schooling. Mom worked tirelessly to provide for us, and Dad never supported us.

123,1efm2t3,AITAH for not giving in to FMIL's habit and family dynamics?,"I (32F) am engaged to my fianc√© (30F) are now having issues with my future MIL. For context, I am an introverted person, and I am very particular with my boundaries. I promised my adult self that I do not want to be put in situations that I am uncomfortable anymore. Additionally, my family does not have the habit of texting or calling each other everyday since we respect each other's boundaries because we understand that everyone has something going on in their own lives.

Disclaimer: these are all my observations and opinions.

Now, MIL has a very different dynamic with her family. She constantly texts and calls her children everyday and if they do not respond or miss the calls, she would take it personally and say that they are excluding her in her life. The issue now is that my fianc√© and I had taken a vacation with friends in the city where FMIL lived. Fianc√© already met up with FMIL the day prior we (my friends and I) arrived in the city. Since this is a pre-planned vacation (which FMIL knew), we didn't have time to meet up with her because the agenda had already been set up and we had planned out to drive to a different city as well during the short stay. Long story short, we were busy going around and my social battery had been drained more than its limits to the point that I do not have the capacity to talk to anyone else anymore, outside of the friend group. By the last day as we were driving to the airport, I texted FMIL as a courtesy to say that we are heading to the airport and since we were not able to meet up during our stay in the city, that I will make it up to her when she comes visit in our city or if I come over to visit again. She responded to me that it was disrespectful, and a call should have been enough. I asked her what's disrespectful and she said that it's important to build a relationship with her since she's my future MIL. I told her that I didn't know I was held accountable to these expectations because my family dynamics didn't work that way. I even told her that different people build relationships differently and just because she does it differently than me, meant that I was disrespecting her. She just responded that ""*it's not just a habit. It's your character*"". At this point, I was so confused. I explained to her that expectations are only valid if two parties had understood and agreed on the expectations that was being imposed, and the only response I got was ""*don't be too cerebral*.""

My fianc√© is aware of the conversation and had called out her mom since I was talking to her in an objective perspective as best as I can. I told FMIL that I am not gonna talk to her anymore if she is not willing to listen to my side and merely judge my character blatantly. One important piece of information is she brought up my mother (which is a sensitive topic for me because she was my best friend and had died just 7 years ago) and took a jab at my family's dynamics as well.

I hate that this conflict is hurting my fianc√© as well since she's in the middle of all of this conflict. But I told her ever since the start of our relationship that their family dynamics is not something that will work for me because my social energy cannot take on this intense communication style. She understood but I of course made sure to compromise with her as well. I respond to her mom's group messages, talk to her on the phone (when she talks to my fianc√©), and even join activities that I don't usually do, for her. Now, my fianc√© is talking to FMIL, and the tone of the conversation is that I need to let go and follow her expectations/dynamics because if I truly love her daughter, I would not let my fianc√© be conflicted.

My fianc√© had sided with me and asked FMIL to apologize to me. During their conversations, FMIL gave passive-aggressive remarks such as ""*Get out while it's still early*,"" and, ""*You have to manage your life because if not, other people will manage it for you*."" The implications as I have interpreted it were: Break up with me while it's still early and I was controlling or influencing my fianc√©'s decision to stand up for me. FMIL even told her, ""*You're not like this before.*"" My fianc√© did not give in to FMIL and asked her mom what she was implying. FMIL was not answering the questions directly and was just giving vague comments such as, *""we need to let go of the past"", ""we have to move forward*,"" and implied that they should just be ""*a happy family*"" when they meet up again (as what usually happens if they have conflict within the family - they ignore it and just act is if everything's good). My fianc√© did not relent and had stopped responding to her, hoping that a break will let clear her mom's head.

FMIL became even madder and had started berating me/us. She said to my fianc√© that she was dumb and an idiot while I was a b-word and we were Satan worshippers. She rescinded her blessing for us to wed and even asked my fianc√© to pay back all the expenses she accumulated as she was growing up. FMIL even threatened to report my fianc√© to the credit bureau if she didn't pay it back right away. She also asked me to pay back an expense that she offered to pay for me as a gift.

Fianc√©'s sister came into play and when she reached out to my fianc√©, she just said to not believe what their mom was saying, and my fianc√© needs to forgive her because ""***she's their mom.""***

This has completely snow-balled into something so much bigger. I am not asking anyone to beg for forgiveness but to just be accountable to what they said. Words have weight and if treated as an after thought, would have consequences. I am tired of older people not taking responsibility for the things they do and say to younger people and expect us to be okay with it just because they are older and, in their mind, they are ""***always right***"". My fianc√© asked her mom to be accountable to the hurtful things she had said to us and the only response she gave to my fianc√© was, ""I am only accountable to God.""

¬†

I don't know what to do. Am I the ahole for standing my ground on my boundaries? Or should I just let it go and do whatever she wants just so we can maintain peace.

P.S. In the duration of this conflict, I have always told my fianc√© that she can make peace with her family because I do not want this conflict to hurt her any more. It is a conflict between my FMIL and I, and if FMIL is ready to talk to me like an adult, I am too. But I will not let her get a pass for basically 'disowning' and saying colorful things with the intent to hurt my fianc√© just because I did not do what she wanted.",TL;DR,2024-07-30,"AITAH for not giving in to FMIL's habit and family dynamics?

FMIL even told her, ""*You're not like this before.*"" My fianc√© did not give in to FMIL and asked her mom what she was implying. FMIL was not answering the questions directly and was just giving vague comments such as, *""we need to let go of the past"", ""we have to move forward*,"" and implied that they should just be ""*a happy family*"" when they meet up again (as what usually happens if they have conflict within the family - they ignore it and just act is if everything's good). My fianc√© did not relent and had stopped responding to her, hoping that a break will let clear her mom's head.

FMIL became even madder and had started berating me/us. She said to my fianc√© that she was dumb and an idiot while I was a b-word and we were Satan worshippers. She rescinded her blessing for us to wed and even asked my fianc√© to pay back all the expenses she accumulated as she was growing up. FMIL even threatened to report my fianc√© to the credit bureau if she didn't pay it back right away. She also asked me to pay back an expense that she offered to pay for me as a gift.

Fianc√©'s sister came into play and when she reached out to my fianc√©, she just said to not believe what their mom was saying, and my fianc√© needs to forgive her because ""***she's their mom.""***

This has completely snow-balled into something so much bigger. I am not asking anyone to beg for forgiveness but to just be accountable to what they said. Words have weight and if treated as an after thought, would have consequences. I am tired of older people not taking responsibility for the things they do and say to younger people and expect us to be okay with it just because they are older and, in their mind, they are ""***always right***"". My fianc√© asked her mom to be accountable to the hurtful things she had said to us and the only response she gave to my fianc√© was, ""I am only accountable to God.""

¬†

I don't know what to do. Am I the ahole for standing my ground on my boundaries? Or should I just let it go and do whatever she wants just so we can maintain peace.

P.S. In the duration of this conflict, I have always told my fianc√© that she can make peace with her family because I do not want this conflict to hurt her any more. It is a conflict between my FMIL and I, and if FMIL is ready to talk to me like an adult, I am too. But I will not let her get a pass for basically 'disowning' and saying colorful things with the intent to hurt my fianc√© just because I did not do what she wanted.",,0.006986359134316444,0,0

She agreed, but canceled 12 hours before I was supposed to leave, claiming she had scheduled something else.

I spent the entire night in a panic, trying to find a last-minute replacement, and eventually found someone at 5 AM for $50. My friend was upset and texting me throughout the night, but her only solution was drop-in care, which I repeatedly told her would make my dog sick.

After the concert, I tried talking to her about the situation, but she wasn't interested in discussing it or her feelings. Now, she's ending our friendship due to ""hurt feelings"" from a couple of situations, including this one, without ever apologizing for canceling on me or acknowledging the stress and panic she caused.

I've tried explaining the issue to her, but she's not interested in listening. I'm frustrated that she's playing the victim card when she was the one who bailed on our agreement and caused me significant stress and financial loss.

128,1eflkem,AITA for not appreciating my bf help? ,"Hi, I am currently attempting to write a book. I have been thinking about a story for a decade now, but never got much writing done.
My boyfriend has some experience with writing as he has written an unfinished novel before and a few short-stories. He reads a lot of light novels and therefore he writes very similarly to them. 
Now that I‚Äôve finally sat down to write, the story has gained a concrete shape and is no longer just random plot ideas. I plan on it eventually becoming a book series.

Yesterday when I sat down to write I realized that I had a lot of ideas that were clouding my mind, and that to get my themes across and to remain consistent with the themes/ideas for the entire series I would have to write down all of my ideas and create a general outline of events. I felt this was especially important because I could never figure out how to get from point A to point B or where to begin, and it would lead me to stop writing.
Today I have completed my outline of events for the first book and it no longer feels impossible to think about the little details. 

My issue is that, while my boyfriend was talking to me, I had my outline open as I had been working on it. He then began questioning me on it. He said that writing an outline is unnecessary and will constrain my story, and that instead I should let my characters be free to make their own decisions and act naturally, and that by doing so the story will naturally shape itself. I told him that there were certain events I wanted to happen because I am following a theme, and that if I have any new ideas while writing then I will try to add them and see how they reshape the remainder of the story, but that for now I needed some direction. 
He argued that my story will be boring if I try to force things to happen.

I became annoyed because he kept repeating the same advice and just wouldn‚Äôt let go. Why am I doing that? What is the point of it? Have I written anything? Why did I stop writing here? Why do I have the outline open? What is the natural progression of my character‚Äôs actions? Would my character actually do that or was I trying to force them into a situation (he hasn‚Äôt read any of it).
I understand that it‚Äôs well-intended and his advice is sound, but I have tried just writing in the past and I never went anywhere with it. I always got stuck, couldn‚Äôt figure out what to write the next chapters on since I didn‚Äôt know the next major plot, and ended up overwhelmed with it. I also never asked him for his advice or help, but he insists on giving it. This happens a lot, even in other situations. Sometimes I am just talking about something and he starts instructing me and advising me, and at times it feels like I‚Äôm being scolded. 

I simply ended up telling him to let me write my book the way I want to write it, and he got upset and told me that the story would end up boring my way. He says he is upset because I had an attitude.

We were then going to go out for drinks after to celebrate.

She then told me she would be in at 4pm instead and would miss the event but would meet me after for drinks. I was disappointed but agreed to meet her after and instead another friend of mine agreed to come out for the hour with me so we could go to the event. 
Then 4pm came and went and there was no sign of Sara and no messages to tell me she was going to be late again so my friend decided she would stay out with me instead but needed to go back to her house to shower and change before the night out.

They take jobs out of the city about an hours worth of driving, so he‚Äôs up at 3am to get ready for work. Then comes home around 5pm. When he‚Äôs home he showers, eats, and sleeps at 9pm. 

I work remotely 5 days a week. I also care for our two kids while working. It‚Äôs bearable since I‚Äôve simplified my work at my job as much as possible, and it only takes me 4 hours to complete 8 hours of work. 

He‚Äôs been working for 14 days without a day off. I clean, cook, care for the kids, and work while he‚Äôs gone simultaneously. I occasionally need a break and this has been impossible since he‚Äôs usually tired after work and just wants to sit down sometimes. For context he walks 15k to 25k steps at work daily including heavy lifting. 

Today I cleaned the house from top to bottom as we are expecting guests. My child opens cheerios on the freshly mopped floor and dumps it. My husband just says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do that‚Äù sitting from the couch instead of going to clean it up. I was cleaning the kitchen. 

I was fuming in anger because to me, he‚Äôs present with us for 4 hours, and in those 4 hours is sunken and sleepy and has no energy. He was sitting back spacing out from how tired he was and I snapped and asked ‚Äúare you okay?‚Äù In a rude tone. If he‚Äôs going to sit on the couch looking like a dead fish staring off into space and not actively engage with us, then he should just go to sleep in the room. I also JUST mopped, he should‚Äôve been considerate and picked up the cereal as soon as he saw it. He didn‚Äôt respond to me and we didn‚Äôt talk with each other for the rest of the night. 

I‚Äôm tired of him being sleepy/non present for the 4 hours he‚Äôs with us every day from work. He doesn‚Äôt have to work this much, I am okay with him working less hours and taking the financial hit on things we enjoy. As long as we get family time. He didn‚Äôt listen and just keeps working these crazy hours. I recommended a different roofing team and he claims they don‚Äôt pay as well. 

If I‚Äôm in the wrong just be brutally honest with me. Please leave any advice on how I can cope, I don‚Äôt want to make him upset and have tried to come to a compromise with him to no avail. 

UPDATE: Spoke with him. He said he‚Äôs saving for the winter since there is no work those days and his savings will be depleted. He said it‚Äôs impossible to not be tired after walking 25k steps and heavy lifting biologically. He said he wants to continue with these hours and team, and that the benefits in the down seasons overwrite the negatives in the summer.

133,1efkjl1,AITA for telling my dad on my sister?,"Throwaway bc some of my friends have reddit

I'm 21F with two sisters ages 16 and 4. Youngest sister was unplanned an a surprise to everyone. Our mom passed away in an accident a couple years ago. 

My dad has to work a lot so sometimes my little sister comes over so I can watch her. My 16yo sister doesn't babysit as often as I do. She's on break from school right now so she would have time to watch her but she also has a car and a boyfriend. She would rather spend her time off from school hanging out with friends and her boyfriend than baby sitting. Which I don't blame her at all. 

Anyways yesterday my sister came over and I babysat like normal. Later that day I get a phone call from my 16yo sister asking if she could come over. She said that all of her friends were either at work or on vacation and she was really bored.

Later I was inside making lunch and my sisters were outside tossing around a basketball in the parking lot outside the apartment. All of a sudden I hear a crash and the basketball comes flying through the window. My sisters come inside and my 16yo sister explains that the 4yo is the one who broke the window. Me and the older sister clean up the glass and I have a talk with the youngest. I explain to her that she has to be more careful. Luckily my apartment has maintenance who was able to replace the window. 

My apartment has security footage of the parking lot and outside that I can access on my phone. I was just curious to see if the window breaking was caught on camera. Spoiler alert: it was. 

I was really shocked at what I saw. The 4 year old did not break the window. The 16 year old did. It was obvious that it was an accident and the ball had just gotten away from her. So basically I told my dad what had happened. I wasn't mad about the broken window. We were able to get it cleaned up and fixed pretty quickly. no big deal. I was upset that my sister lied and blamed her actions on someone too young to defend herself. 

My sister is really mad at me for telling my dad on her. She accused me of lying so I sent my dad a screen recording of the footage. She is so upset at me that she left the family group chat. I think I might be the AH because I escalated the situation when I don't even care that much about the broken window in the first place",Not the A-hole,2024-07-30,"AITA for telling my dad on my sister?

Towards the end of the new obituary, my aunt added a whole section of survived by that was not included in the original.

The government officially recognizes my disability, and I see five different specialist doctors to keep me alive and somewhat healthy. The challenge I face is that all my disabilities are internal, such as autoimmune diseases and mental health disorders. Consequently, most people assume I can get a job or do anything they can, even when I explain precisely why I can't.

I don't mind calmly educating people, but it gets immensely frustrating when they dismiss my explanations as ""just excuses."" I still maintain my composure and either change the subject or leave the conversation entirely.

Well, today, I wanted to spend time with a close friend (20M) and was excited to enjoy his company after a long day. However, he started talking about me working out with him. I explained why I can't, sharing that I had worked out every day for three months straight, resulting only in permanent damage to my knees with no positive impact on my physical or mental health.

I tried to remain calm, but when he said, ""I'm tired of people who are so negative and keep making excuses on why they can't,"" I completely lost it. Years of bottled-up anger erupted, and I borderline yelled at him, expressing how my entire life I've had to endure ignorant comments like that. I told him that if he's going to keep talking about it then I'm just going to leave the call. He responded with, ""You can end the call,"" and I proceeded to do just that.

This is my first post here. I‚Äôm kind of a newbie with reddit too because I rarely post, but here I am out of pure frustration.

So the past weekend me and my boyfriend went to his summerhouse where his parents were also there. Both his parents love dogs, but they aren‚Äôt really dog people. I would say they are very old school when it comes to dogs

A few months ago they lost their family dog due to idiopathic neuropathy and I can empathize with how much they miss having him around and spoiling him.
However, as mentioned above they aren‚Äôt that well versed with properly taking care of a dog, and making sure he doesn‚Äôt eat things he isn‚Äôt supposed to eat (I‚Äôve seen them feed their dog who passed, bones from table scraps, ice cream, etc, amongst other thingsüò±)

Arriving there I asked both of them specifically to not give my dog (who is epileptic and on medication) anything from the table. I also left a bag of dog snacks out for them to give my dog anytime they wanted to ‚Äúspoil‚Äù him.

Within the first 30‚Äô of being there I caught my BF‚Äôs dad sneaking my dog chocolate ice cream, and then flat out denying he did it, despite me telling him off (politely but in a firm way). 

The next morning over breakfast, he sneakily did it again giving my dog a sugar cookie dipped in yoghurt, while I was sitting right smack across the table from him chatting with his wife. I realized that he did it again because my dog was chewing something at his feet under the table. 

I was fuming. But did not say anything because I would have just gone off on him and didn‚Äôt want to start a fight with my potential father in law at his house where I was a guest.
I asked my BF to have a chat with him, which he did but his dad denied doing it once again.

I then had two more discussions with my BF begging him to put his dad in his place. His reply was ‚ÄúI‚Äôve told him so many times, he doesn‚Äôt get it, he is stubborn, that‚Äôs the way he is‚Äù, to which I replied ‚Äúit‚Äôs like me inviting your parents over for dinner and cooking everything with garlic and onions, feeding them to your dad, watch him get sick and then denying I added those to the food‚Äù (his dad due to having half his pancreas removed due to a tumor a few years back cannot eat onions/garlic or he will get sick) to which BF did not reply.

141,1efk56g,WIBTA For not paying $2k+ as terms for returning my cat?,"\*\*Using fake names for privacy purposes\*\*

I'm not sure where to post this, so voila! This is a long one so sit tight. My cat, Ivy, went missing for a week when Bill messaged me saying he found our cat, held him for a week, got my number from the microchip, and let the cat out again BEFORE calling me. I'm baffled that they would let him out again like that, but I'm thankful for knowing our cat is still alive and well.

After two weeks of searching for him, my roommate who is currently out of town, Jen, sends me another number that supposedly found him as well. We meet up, they, also named Bill, return our Ivy, along with a ton of cat supplies bc they only had dogs and didn't need it. They also mention taking him to an emergency vet and treating him for Mycoplasma. I offered to reimburse them for everything and asked for the receipt. They turned down the offer, even after stating that they spent over $2000 on the vet visit (that's what you get for going to an emergency vet), also refusing to show the receipt. They just talked about how much they loved our cat.

A few hours later, my roommate sends me a text with basically their terms of returning our cat (which I clearly didn't know about). 1. If anyone in our family tests positive for mycoplasma in the next 2, you are financially responsible. (pretty sure this ain't legally binding) 2. If we, or our neighbors ever find him again, Ivy will be euthanized. (is this legal?) And as if this makes it less threatening: 3. Give him lots of love. He's an angel and I would have loved to keep him if it weren't for my dogs.

I find something fishy about this. They were in cahoots with their neighbor who had my number for two week. If they got him treated for Mycoplasma, then the vet visit must have been right when they found him, which means his chip was probably scanned there as well. I can't figure out their intentions for keeping him so long and spending so much when they could've just returned him for us to deal with. Keep in mind, both neighbors who had him were named Bill. If it weren't for their refusal of reimbursement, I would think they were scamming us. Or maybe they think they could use term #1 later. Wanted to keep him maybe? I just don't get why they would hold him for so long after finding my contact information.

145,1efj5q0,AITA for not accepting my brother‚Äôs gf‚Äôs apology?,"I (18F) have one brother (22) who has recently started dating a woman who I'll refer to as Julia (21) for clarity's sake. Julia is autistic and was diagnosed later in life after being falsely diagnosed with a laundry list of other things, including depression and social anxiety. Neither me nor my brother have any neurodivergencies, so I can't relate to anything Julia goes through on a day-to-day basis. 

I still live with my parents, and my brother and Julia stop by often for dinner and w/e after work. Julia seems to make my brother very happy, which is all I care about, so I've been trying to get to know her and understand more about what it's like to walk in her shoes (only when she brings it up- I get that it's not her job to be the Speaker of the Austistic Community). Occasionally she will weave in a comment or two in casual conversation about 'allistics' (which I've learned is another word for neurotypical people) and about how we can be self-centered, rude, egotistical, manipulative, etc., all of which I find odd considering she is dating one. I don't comment on it because I figure that's been her experience and she's allowed to have her opinions.

Last week, though, she and I had a big blowout. She had brought over a dish that she likes to make and I'd taken it from her and put it in the oven to keep it warm and had told her so when she'd asked me, but later in the night when she opened the oven it was gone. I looked around for it, only to find that one of my parents had moved it and placed it in the fridge (not sure why, but I had assumed it was so that the oven could be used). Julia absolutely blew up at me, telling me that I was 'an allistic liar' and that I'd ruined her dish. She demanded to know why I didn't tell her 'the truth' about where I'd put it, which I tried to tell her that I had, but she refused to believe me. I will admit that I did not take kindly to being called a liar, and I told her that I didn't appreciate her generalizing me and my family into the lump of whoever had hurt her by calling us names despite the hospitality we'd shown her.

My brother tried to salvage the situation and calm her down, but she took her dish and left with him. My parents were very upset with her and told my brother that they would not welcome her into their home again until she apologized for shouting at me.

She texted me the other day and 'apologized,' which was essentially her telling me that she was sorry I felt that way. I told her that that was not an apology, and that she did not get to call me a liar in my own home and insult my parents (and brother!) repeatedly and give me a crappy non-apology. Now my brother is texting me and telling me that I am not understanding of Julia's experience and her trauma. I know that I can never understand what it's like to be her, but I also don't think that being neurodivergent can exempt you from showing human decency-- especially to your boyfriend's family.

147,1efivb4,AITA Husband left stepson with me to go golfing,"Backstory:
I was 20 years old with a full time job and two kids when I left their alcoholic father. Over the course of the next 16 years I was a single mom in every sense because he couldnt be bothered to pay support or help me out with them in any way. So whenever they got sick or had an appointment or an activity to attend, it was all on me to miss work, cancel plans, or otherwise rearrange to accommodate their needs.


Recent events:
Husband and I met and I was introduced to SS whom he had every other weekend. Husband has a very demanding work schedule and lived an hour away until he moved in with me a year later. We agreed to split shared expenses (ie rent, utilities, groceries) 50/50 while each paying for our own expenses (ie car insurance, fuel, credit cards). Household tasks were not discussed but it naturally fell to me due to his work schedule and commute. A year after that I began having flare ups with my depression and severe panic attacks due to my job. Husband saw this and suggested we move to his old city so he can be close to work and I could take a break from the workforce. We talked it over and came to the following agreement:
‚Ä¢ I would quit my job 
‚Ä¢ We would move to his old city 
‚Ä¢ I would make it possible for us to have SS for extended period of time by being available when Husband has to work
‚Ä¢ I would handle pick up/drop off and attend events when Husband has to work
‚Ä¢ I would handle all household chores like cooking cleaning and laundry

Current situation in question:
I am now 39, Husband is 36, and SS is 12. February of this year I started a part time job because I was tired of being home alone and bored because I didn't have my own money. I average about 20 hours a week which is just enough for my gas, vape habits, credit card, and things like bday gifts for my family members, and maybe a little something to save or spend. I'm not contributing to household expenses but I am working as much as I'm capable of and took back most of my own expenses. So AITA for feeling resentful that I'm still the default for taking care of the house and SS while Husband goes out for fun or naps in his free time?

149,1efitn5,AITA if I say no to being a bridesmaid in my friends wedding because I hate the fiance? ,"
I have this friend who got engaged a week ago and she has asked me to be a bridesmaid. We work together and she asked me at work which was awkward time when people were around so in the moment I said sure. 

Back story: I don‚Äôt really know her that well, we went to school together but weren‚Äôt friends, we hungout in different crowds. We met a few years ago at a mutual friends party. We had gotten closer and would hangout here and there. She doesn‚Äôt have a lot of friends, and I started to realize that once someone says they don‚Äôt like her boyfriend she stops talking to them. I started to distance myself from her for two reasons 1) she became very clingy and I am a low maintenance friend and felt very smothered 2) because I realized I also realllly don‚Äôt like her boyfriend/fiance now. 

I noticed he is very controlling, he won‚Äôt let her dance even if at a wedding , even in a room with two of her close girlfriends and no one else around. He says she embarrasses him. If she is wearing a tank top , she gets in trouble for being too revealing. 

I started to notice these things about him a bit ago but didn‚Äôt do or say anything because it‚Äôs not my place, again we aren‚Äôt that that close  . But one day we went to a cottage and drove up with them and on the way back him and I got into an argument. He is very sexiest, homophobic and racist. Now he claims he is not but his micro aggressions, actions and the things he literally says show different. And for me that‚Äôs not something I am about, I just can‚Äôt be around people like that. So we got into a heated argument,  it didn‚Äôt escalate too bad because I was still trying to be mindful of my friends feelings at the time . But there were one or two incidents after that where he would make comments in group settings and  I was told things he would say to mutual friends who is a poc and i decided I wouldn‚Äôt talk to him really anymore. I told myself I would be cordial but there‚Äôs no reason I need to be around him cause I know if any of those topics come up again I will lose it and it will be a big fight . 

Anyways so my dilemma here is I do not want to be in the wedding for multiple reasons . The big reason is  I cannot stand him and I don‚Äôt think she should marry him. Now I just don‚Äôt know how to say that without being rude. I don‚Äôt want to upset her but I dont want to be in the wedding . And honestly she shouldn‚Äôt want me, as soon as she find outs that I don‚Äôt like him she‚Äôs not gunna wanna be friends and then I‚Äôm gunna be in their wedding photos t forever and that‚Äôs just not what you want. You want your best best friends. 

So I‚Äôm wondering am I the asshole if I say no? Is it better to make up a lighter excuse as to why I want to say no or should I be honest , which is harsh?

150,1efif3x,AITA (27M) for not siding with my girlfriend (24F) who feels slighted by her family?,"Background: My girlfriend recently had a cousin move into town after the cousin had graduated high school, moving here for college at the nearby major university that my girlfriend and I both attended during our college years.  My girlfriend's parents and the cousin's parents both own a single company altogether, and both sides of the family are pretty well off financially as a result. When my girlfriend moved here for school, she lived on campus at the university and over time moved on to a nicer and nicer standard of living as she progressed in school and began working. She is now graduated and working towards graduate school. The cousin, however moved here into a relatively expensive house that her parents had bought her outright, in a nice part of town.

Issue: Any time the situation gets brought up, my girlfriend expresses a lot of anger and frustration, feeling backstabbed by her cousin's side of the family. She feels as though she has worked hard to get where she is and meanwhile the cousin (who apparently abuses their parents' wealth to often get what they want without hassle) moves into a nice house. This is also an issue because the family's shared company combines financial resources, so my girlfriend believes that the other side of the family is abusing the shared wealth. Also, the cousin's side of the family has not made consistent efforts to connect with my girlfriend since they moved her cousin up here.

Result: Any time it gets brought up, I just nod my head until we stop talking about it, or I try to dig deeper to understand and say the wrong thing and upset her. It is an issue because we have yet to find a way to come to terms or to resolve our perspectives of the situation.

My take: To me it comes off as envy or jealousy. I am certainly not perfect and will never claim to be, but I try my best to not let these types of inclincations take over me emotionally when I have almost no control over the situation. I make the argument that if my girlfriend was in the cousin's situation, would she still feel the same? All parents do their best to take care of their children somehow. 

AITA? Feel free to ask any clarifying questions.

153,1efia4v,AITA For my neighbors dog dying while I was pet sitting?,"So my older neighbor texted me and asked if I could look after her dog while she goes out of town and I immediately said yes because I have done it before and few years ago, like her dog a lot, and she pays well. I second guessed my decision when she told me she‚Äôd be gone for 3 weeks but figured it would be worth it for the money and I‚Äôd get to hang out with her dog. Her dogs a golden retriever whose name is Tucker and he was 17 years old when he passed away last week while I was pet sitting. Obviously he was very old. He was on 6 different types of medication throughout the day and had difficulty breathing and could barely stand because his back legs were so weak. He was in far worse shape than the last time I looked after him. She didn‚Äôt let  me know about these things until the first day when I saw a note on her kitchen counter detailing the times he needed what medication and his daily routine (which had changed dramatically since I last pet sitted for her). Unfortunately he passed away a week and a half into me looking after him. I did everything she wanted me to do for him at the times she suggested I do them, and even used my lunch break at work multiple times to go let him inside when it was hot out (even though she said he ‚Äúenjoys warm weather‚Äù - it was like 95 and humid most days) or make sure he used the bathroom so he wouldn‚Äôt go inside her house. Calling her to let her know he died was one of the most difficult things I‚Äôve ever done (I‚Äôm 21 btw home for the summer from college). I expected her to be sad but she instead got very angry at me.

AITA in this situation for the dog dying?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-30,"AITA For my neighbors dog dying while I was pet sitting? So my older neighbor texted me and asked if I could look after her dog while she goes out of town and I immediately said yes because I have done it before and few years ago, like her dog a lot, and she pays well. I second guessed my decision when she told me she‚Äôd be gone for 3 weeks but figured it would be worth it for the money and I‚Äôd get to hang out with her dog. Her dogs a golden retriever whose name is Tucker and he was 17 years old when he passed away last week while I was pet sitting. Obviously he was very old. He was on 6 different types of medication throughout the day and had difficulty breathing and could barely stand because his back legs were so weak. He was in far worse shape than the last time I looked after him. She didn‚Äôt let  me know about these things until the first day when I saw a note on her kitchen counter detailing the times he needed what medication and his daily routine (which had changed dramatically since I last pet sitted for her). Unfortunately he passed away a week and a half into me looking after him. I did everything she wanted me to do for him at the times she suggested I do them, and even used my lunch break at work multiple times to go let him inside when it was hot out (even though she said he ‚Äúenjoys warm weather‚Äù - it was like 95 and humid most days) or make sure he used the bathroom so he wouldn‚Äôt go inside her house. Calling her to let her know he died was one of the most difficult things I‚Äôve ever done (I‚Äôm 21 btw home for the summer from college). I expected her to be sad but she instead got very angry at me.

154,1efi93v,AITA For refusing to replace my sister's tire that went flat while I was driving?,"Last week my sister and her boyfriend needed a ride to the airport, I volunteered to take them. When I got there I offered to drive her car, I have a single cab truck with 3 seats and it was a bit of a mess so it would have taken some time to rearrange enough space to fit all of us. I also figured using their gas made more sense in the end. I drove them to the airport and I was a little speedy(~80). they were running a bit late and I guess my sister didn't really approve of said driving. That's all fine but I think it's screwed me a bit in the long run. I drop them off, drive the 45 ish minutes back to the house. The section of highway by my house is being entirely redone, so I'm driving through it like I do pretty much every day, I get off at my exit and start slowing down then the tire goes flat almost immediately. I limp the exit and a Wendy's right up the road. ""Oh you've got to be fucking kidding me"" is the first thing I said. I had plans for my day and this really threw a wrench in them. Whatever it is what it is. I go around back and fantastic the spare has air!
Unfortunately no jack, or wrench. I've got a spare but nothing to put it on with :| 

I call her up to let her know as well as see if I can figure out where the tools are, the first words out of her mouth are ""if you're calling me to tell me you wrecked my car"" I was a little annoyed but explained the situation. she has no idea and pretty quickly hits me with a statement that essentially read ""well what are you going to do to fix it"". I was taken aback. I was tempted to just leave the car there, I was doing her a favor and now I'm the one getting screwed. As soon as I hang up, my phone dies, which was rather unfortunate. I ran back to my house. It was a few miles so it wasn't terrible but definitely not how I wanted to spend my time.

I finally get home, and contact AAA to get a guy to replace the tire. That takes a few hours and at this point I'm getting dangerously close to missing my own plans but the guy finally calls, he's a couple minutes out. I'll just stop by there on the way, oversee the project and pick it up when I get home. No big deal. That fails, my other sister helps me get it home.

Fast forward 4 days, 

I receive a text 

""Any update on the car situation"" 

I tell her it's parked at the house

""Is the tire replaced though?""

I say tell her no, and also tell her a plug/patch won't do it. It needs to be replaced.

""Are you going to get it replaced before Wednesday morning?""

I say no, and explain I don't like the way I'm being spoken to as if it's my job to fix this tire.

She says she has work Wednesday morning and ""figured 4 days would be enough time for you to get it replaced"" 

I say ""you're saying it like it's my responsibility to fix your tire"" and explain my schedule, even if I wanted to I didn't have time for that in those 4 days

155,1efi2vu,AITA for telling a friend to confront another friend before a trip?,"I'm part of a friend group where my friend Ann introduced us all to each other, and now we do a lot of group activities and adventures together. All of us have gotten along and consider each other ""girl's girls,"" where we all focus on celebrating each other rather than tearing one another down. Recently, Ann came to me in-confidence that a friend in our group, Sara, was saying negative things about her behind her back at work, as heard from a co-worker. Ann was very upset and hurt by this, as she considers Sara to be a close friend. However, I have never heard Sara say anything negative about Ann.

Sara and I were at an event one afternoon, and she asked me if I had heard from Ann. Sara stated that Ann was acting very cold to her and completely ignored her one day, whereas Ann is usually a very bubbly and friendly person. Sara said she did not know what could have upset Ann, and that if she had an issue with her, she would like for her to tell her what she did wrong so she could reconcile it. I felt caught in the middle at that moment, as Ann asked me to keep the previous discussion between us. I said that I had not, and that Ann may have been overwhelmed at the moment. Sara did not push the discussion and we continued with our event.

I contacted Ann after this and told her that it would be smart if she could talk to Sara about what was going on as she was making it very obvious that there was an issue between her and Sara. She told me she was having a hard time handling it because she's bad at confrontation and did not have the mental bandwidth to talk to her about it at the time.

We have had a weekend trip planned for several months that I invited them to for my birthday. With the trip date approaching, I once again reached out to Ann to see if she had talked to Sara. She said no. I asked her if she could please talk to Sara ahead of time so that it wouldn't be awkward or tense during our trip, since it's not somewhere you could leave or be separate from the other person for most of it. Ann stated that she could drop out of the trip if I preferred, because she felt it would be awkward no matter what. She also said that the situation was very delicate and needed to be handled accordingly, giving me no timeline as to when she would be able to have that conversation with Sara.

I told her that her absence was not what I wanted because I wanted all my friends to be there and have a positive experience, and that it wouldn't be fair to Sara to uninvite her without explanation. She once again stated that she wouldn't mind stepping down from the trip. I again reassured her that that's not what I wanted, and told her if that's how she thought was the best way to handle the situation, then it was her decision. I also told her that I would like her decision within a week so that I could make proper arrangements for transportation that depend on whether or not she is coming. She has not replied to me since.

157,1efhut6,AITA for telling my mother I'll call her by her first name if she doesn't respect me and use my preferred name?,"EDIT: My Preferred name is Tyrus and my pronouns are they/them, as well as those are my partners pronouns.

I (22) was named after my mother's late brother, who tragically died in a serious car accident when he was 19. They were incredibly close, and his passing left my mother heartbroken. When I was born a few years later, she named me after him as a way to honor his memory.

Throughout my life, I was constantly reminded of my uncle's mistakes and pressured to excel where he had failed. I was told to achieve straight A's in high school because he didn't graduate. The fear of car accidents was ingrained in me to the point that I developed severe anxiety about driving and still don't have my license. My mother compared me to him in every way, from our looks (which I don't see the resemblance) to our artistic talents, musical tastes, and even fashion choices.

In 2022, with the encouragement of my partner, I decided to change my name. I started going by Tyrus with everyone except my immediate family. By mid-last year, I made it official, and most of my extended family, even those I rarely interact with, were supportive and used my new name. However, my parents refused to accept this change.

Despite my repeated requests for them to use my preferred name, they insisted on calling me by my old name, saying it was special and would always be my name. Frustrated, I told my mother that if she didn't start using my preferred name, I would ignore her or start calling her by her first name. She called me disrespectful and accused me of being an asshole.

A few days ago, I learned from my brothers that my mother was spreading lies about my partner, claiming they were forcing me to change my name out of spite. My mother has always disliked my partner, despite them never mistreating her. She also told family and her friends that my partner kidnapped me when we moved away, was converting me into a devil worshiper (both my partner and I are pagan), and that they planned to baby trap me, sacrifice us, and then ""disappear"", if you know what I mean.

In his late 20s, James was in and out of psych wards and experienced many mental breakdowns. I won‚Äôt go into too much detail, but over the past 2 years the rest of us haven‚Äôt heard much from him. 

I had heard through the grapevine very recently that he‚Äôs doing well, stable job and moved out of his parents place again. With the permission of my fianc√© I decided to send him an email invite to the wedding. He responded within 10 minutes and texted me excited that he‚Äôs gonna come. We caught up over text for a bit and he seemed like old James. 

Initially I was very happy and told the rest of my friends, but they were not as happy back. 2 of them said it was a bad idea and I should‚Äôve just let the friendship with him fade away. They didn‚Äôt want to see him there. Some also said it would add stress to the event and that he could be problematic especially around alcohol. They said I was an ass for not thinking about him and also them, and how it would affect them. This worried me and made me feel like I made a bad decision regarding my wedding. I‚Äôve been stressing about this for days, and even asked my parents and my fiances parents who knew James well (like a decade ago). They weren‚Äôt too thrilled about the decision but said it‚Äôs my choice and hope everything works out. I don‚Äôt know if I can uninvite him now (I really don‚Äôt want to) AITA?

161,1efgdg5,AITA for supposedly making fun of someone‚Äôs brother who passed?,"Now before your read this the title is not accurate I just have no idea what else to title it. This morning I woke up to a instagram DM from a friends asking me saying ‚ÄúI heard you were saying crap about Sarah‚Äôs dead brother (i‚Äôm using a fake name) what did he do to your or her?‚Äù 
I immediately respond back ‚Äúwho is Sarah?‚Äù and the same friend telling me Sarah posted on her story saying I was talking disrespectfully about her brother. 

I immediately go to Sarah‚Äôs instagram account and low and behold she took a screen shot of my current account and my sister‚Äôs old account saying we were sick and twisted people for making fun of her dead brother. 

I immediately DM‚Äôd her trying to resolve this and she didn‚Äôt respond, so about an hour later I posted on my Close Friends story tagging her saying I had no part in this and I am sorry that this had happened to her but me and my sister didn‚Äôt do this. 

She finally responded about 20 minutes later saying It was in fact me and she had our numbers cause she tracked us. I asked her what we supposedly did and she said we sent horrifying messages off of our mother‚Äôs phone mocking her brother‚Äôs passing. 

I responded that that was not true and I was sorry this happened to her but I did not send those messages nor did my sister. She responded and I quote ‚Äúif ur gonna just continue to lie,don‚Äôt bother texting me please. like full honesty. u guys are sick, and I pray for yall because mocking a death is mentally not okay. at all. im done talking to u.‚Äù 

I respected her wishes and did not message her again and I blocked her but now I have received a wave of messages from mutual friends saying that I am sick and they know she isn‚Äôt lying cause she contacted the police to get our information but if that were true wouldn‚Äôt have the police contacted us themselves?

162,1efgbu6,AITA For cutting off in laws completely?,"In October, my hubs and I decided to move 4 hours away from our home to be closer to his family. We had called my MIL to see if my SIL home was empty while we transitioned in the new area, SIL was moving in with her BF. MIL said she had already sold the home, but MIL was planning on moving in with her BF too. She said we could have MIL house and just upkeep it while we saved for one. My hubby found a job in the new area and we cancelled our lease. In January, I had surgery for a nipple bleed. They thought it was an irritated duct, bc nothing showed in scans. Well, I had ER+ breast cancer. I had to go through another surgery, and treatments. We let in laws know that we‚Äôd need support since we‚Äôre moving to be by them, and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do much. They all said ‚Äúabsolutely! We‚Äôre in this together!‚Äù My MIL broke up with her BF two weeks before our move and told us to take her spare rooms. We were apprehensive, but just figured that it came at the right time since we‚Äôd need the help. I couldn‚Äôt lift anything from my first surgery, so we had help moving. We got rid of most of our stuff, but still had a large uhaul full. We confirmed with MIL all items, and she cleared out enough space for us. Her house still had *everything*. She asked why we didn‚Äôt get a storage unit, and we were a little upset, bc the folks that moved us could have helped us move into a storage unit if that had been communicated ahead of time. We had a private room just filled with our boxes, and we thought: ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay, we won‚Äôt be here long.‚Äù

A week later, my second surgery came around. They removed 79 tumors from my breast, and I was under lifting restrictions for a while. We went back to the house after being in a hotel for recovery, and a few days later my MIL is telling everyone how lazy I am because her house is a mess and nothing is unpacked. I‚Äôm flabbergasted and embarrassed. I start cleaning and unpacking, and ended up in the ER w/ a fever and told to go on bed rest for a little while, that I needed to heal. My MIL blasted me to every family member, friend, and neighbor that I‚Äôm a lazy person bc I‚Äôm not doing anything. I was just trying to heal, watching my life crumble, and went through massive depression. I wasn‚Äôt actively being dirty, it was the boxes and the lack of ability to get up and ‚Äúbe a wife‚Äù.

My husband works 12-14 hour days with rare days off, and a one hour commute each way. He had no time. But in laws just continued to come after us and be upset with us bc of all of slander and gossip. Everything that his family had asked for, I jumped and helped with no questions asked. But when we brought it up that we hadn‚Äôt received any help, and everyone just got after us, the slander continued.

163,1efgbhf,AITA for unknowingly selling a vehicle that won‚Äôt pass inspection?,"
About a month ago, we sold an older SUV (20+ years old, 300,000+ km) that was my daily driver until I went on maternity leave 3 years ago. We bought a smaller, more efficient vehicle soon after. We were unsure of what to do with it, so it sat in our driveway, with occasional charges to the battery and trips to the car wash until recently when we decided to unload it. We were incredibly clear in our marketplace ad that it had been sitting for an extended period of time with no maintenance. It was sold for a super reasonable price to a couple who bought on the spot, not even wanting to test drive despite that being offered and encouraged by us. Today, my husband receives an email accusing us of scamming this couple, of knowingly having sold them an unsafe vehicle. They had taken it in for inspection and were told it needed nearly $10k worth of work on the drivetrain to make it roadworthy. We absolutely did not know that it was in such bad shape, I drove it happily every day at 9 months pregnant. We assumed it would need some repairs and maintenance having sat for so long and were clear about this. Had these people come back to us with the vehicle and the inspection report, we almost definitely would have returned their $2k. Instead they had the vehicle towed to a local wrecker, and then sent a slew of angry accusatory emails. She did include a photo of the vehicle hooked up to the wreckers tow truck, or I would have assumed this was some sort of scam. They are insisting that we ‚Äúdo the right thing‚Äù and refund the purchase price. I am absolutely refusing at this point given that they chose to junk the vehicle before we even spoke with them.

165,1effvm6,AITA for mentioning I was in a relationship in front of my co-worker?,"So, I (M) work at a small business where everyone knows each other pretty well. Recently, during a lunch break, I was chatting with my coworkers about life and mentioned that I had recently been in a relationship. One of my coworkers is my ex; we had a short relationship and ended things amicably because we weren't compatible.

I never mentioned my ex's name or said that they worked at our company. Just made a casual comment about a past relationship. Then, one of the ""superiors"" (someone with more responsibility but not actual management) interrupted our conversation and told me in front of everyone that it was inappropriate to talk about relationships at work. I was the only one told this, which made me think he knows about the relationship. Given how close everyone is and the fact that we have different shifts, my ex could have talked to him in private.

My ex never told me she was uncomfortable with the topic, and I didn‚Äôt name names. Was I out of line for bringing it up, or is this ""superior"" overstepping? AITA?

By the way, by short I mean less than a month of a relationship with no bases covered if you know what I mean.
