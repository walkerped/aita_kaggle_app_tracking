0,1egqrlb,AITA for angrily coming out to my brothers?,"Relevant characters: me (32 NB) my mom (63 f) and my brothers Chuck(42 m) and Tyler(30 m). Growing up I always had a bad relationship with my tyler but with chuck was good. As adults tyler apologized for bullying me growing up, and our relationship has improved but we're still not close. Growing up me and tyler played rugby, my mom was into it, and so was my chuck.

I'm non binary but very passing and before this only out to my mom. 

About two months ago chuck sent me a transphobic reel specifically about nb people. I told him it wasn't cool and we had a short but civil conversation about it. I thought it ended ok. 

My family has never been the type with a running group chat that gets active regularly, but my wife's does. I guess I've always kinda wanted that from my family so occasionally I'll make an effort to text the group chat. Earlier this week I started texting about the USA rugby sevens at the Olympics. Specifically about the women's taking bronze. Ilona moher is a beast, and a national treasure. I asked if they had seen the bronze medal match and sent a TikTok of it.

Tyler responded by saying he can't watch the Olympics because of the opening ceremony. He explained they ""mocked Christianity on an international platform."" Chuck agreed and said that people today are crazy. 

I responded maybe slightly aggressive just trying to calm their anger. I said ""Even though the organizers have already said that it was the Greek god dionsys and have apologized for it's resemblance to the last supper? The Olympics are Greek. We don't have to be offended by everything, art like this is subjective and people can accidently send messages they don't intend.""

My brothers then said they were lying, they know what they saw, they're allowed to be offended. 

Then chuck posted screenshots of our Convo from last month, saying I was offended by this video. I think this is where I saw red and was seriously hurt. I feel like this was a violation of privacy. 

The Convo moved onto them complaining about trans athletes. 

Eventually I responded: ""I was offended by the video because it was being openly cruel to non binary people. And I'm fucking non binary. The blue man at the Olympics could be interpreted as an attack on Christianity. That video specifically said ""I don't respect non binary people""

Crickets. 

My mom made a comment that were allowed to have different opinions and don't need to argue. She also texted me separately to see if I was free Friday, and sent some reels. I haven't responded to any of them. 

By brothers haven't said a single thing to me which is kinda driving me nuts.

My wife says I should be pissed at all three. My brothers for being assholes and my mom for not defending me. I'm used to my mom doing this.

1,1eg95xz,AITA for telling my roommate that I’m going to have sex whether she is there or not?,"For context, we are living in school campus housing and each individual has their own room in the 4 bedroom apartment. 

Basically, two of our roommates have graduated and two of us were left behind. My room is right next to hers. As me and my roommate were discussing potential new roommates, I was talking to her about how we should apply the same rule about how it’s okay to have guests over, just let everyone know ahead of time. She agreed, but told me she has this boundary due to something that happened to her friend (EDIT: it has to do w the friend’s roommates sexual activity, idk any more than this) in which if someone had a significant other (which I do), they are not allowed to have sex when ANYONE is home. I asked what if we’re trying to be quiet? And she laughed in my face and said impossible. I asked if it’s just her or when anyone is home? She said anyone.The way she said it so sternly caught me off guard and made me feel inferior in that moment. Our conversation ended, and this didn’t sit right with me because I don’t think it’s anyone’s right to dictate whether you’re intimate with your partner or not unless you share the same room. We each pay the same amount to live in our own rooms. And I was also wondering why she decided to only say this now and not when every single person first moved in to the apartment (and one of them happened to have a boyfriend as well, but she never stayed at the apartment). She is an older student in her mid-late 20’s and is also very Christian, and I felt like she was applying her own values or discomfort with sex onto me. And the one time my boyfriend was over, everyone else was out of town. So I texted her the next day that we need to revisit that convo. 

The next day comes, I first ask her what happened to her friend that made her set up this rule? She replied saying that she thought about it and she was being a little unfair because what her boundary may be may not apply to our future roommate’s boundaries, so as long as SHE isn’t home, I can have sex. I told her that my boyfriend and I are long distance and I only see him one weekend every month or month and a half, so imma have sex REGARDLESS of her being home if I wanted to, and that if we shared a room or if I was being loud and obnoxious, that’s an entirely different story. She looked caught off guard but I left it at that, but I kind of want to revisit the conversation again and make it a point that I don’t know whether she is in her room all the time and it’s literally weird for me to be worrying about HER and whether she is home or not when I want to be intimate with my partner and that if the idea of sex alone makes her squeamish then she needs to grow tf up. Should I? AITA?

Edit: Thanks for your responses. I won’t revisit the convo w her unless there’s a need to and I’ll do it in a respectful manner while trying to be reasonable!

2,1eg95en,AITA for moving out of a toxic sharehouse?,"I (29 ftm) lived with my “friends” Layla (30 mtf) and Adrian (23 ftm) for 2 years. We were all quite close, and Layla and Adrian were dating. Adrian moved in with us after only being with Layla for a short amount of time, and I’m pretty sure that they knew each other when Adrian was a minor. We were all mentally ill and traumatised, but we worked well together. However, there were problems. The house was always an absolute mess, there was rubbish everywhere (not mine), and the kitchen was always full of dirty dishes. My room was clean and I needed to keep a mug, bowl, and spoon separate otherwise I wouldn’t have anything to use. While living with them, I wasn’t doing well, I was abusing weed and alcohol, but at the time I didn’t realise that these behaviours were a coping mechanism related to my environment. I did so much for my “friends,” I would always drive them around without getting financially compensated, but I refused to clean up after their mess.

I would often go to my ex-boyfriend’s (28 m) house to get away from everything. It would take a few days for my mood to settle, and when I went home again my mood would drop as soon as I entered the door. Layla and Adrian kept inviting people who would otherwise be homeless to live with us, and while they always asked me first, I felt like I didn’t have much of a choice. One of these people was a 20-year-old (Beau) with a baby who was in a new relationship with Layla (they were poly), and the age gap made me uncomfortable. There was also an 18-year-old (Will) who was in trouble with the law. Beau and Will brought a lot of trauma into our house and the mess got worse. I tried to talk to my housemates about the mess and that it was affecting my mental health but nothing changed.

As everything at home got worse, so did my mental health. My memory has always been quite bad and I forgot something quite important which broke Layla’s trust. I no longer felt self in my home and I needed to get out of there, so I organised to move in with my ex. I did not give much notice since it was quite urgent, and while I recognise that I should have given more warning, but I needed to get out of there. Upon moving out, I was under the assumption that four people with incomes would be able to cover rent and other expenses. After I moved out, Layla sent me a very long and detailed message abusing me, claiming that she never believed me when it came to my memory, and called me a manipulative liar. I was so shocked and upset that I didn’t stand up for myself. Layla later called me to verbally abuse me and hung up before I had a chance to say anything. I was good friends with her for years and I considered her to be family, but I guess she was never my friend in the first place.

Layla, Adrian, Beau, and Will stopped paying rent and abandoned the property, leaving the fridge, washing machine, personal belongings, rubbish, and dishes. After moving out my mental health improved, and I stopped drinking and smoking weed.

3,1eg92b4,"AITA for ""fact checking"" someone after they told me something interesting?","Throwaway because friends follow my main.

So, a little bit of back story.  
I love anything and everything about fun facts, tidbits, general trivia and the like and if someone says to me ""hey OP, wanna hear a cool fact?"" You're damn right I do. If I haven't heard it before and I find it interesting I will often Google what they told me to learn more and on some occasions even offer additional information to the person who told me so we can have a discussion about it.

Here is where I want to know if I am the asshole. I was with some friends at a pub last weekend and I met some friends of friends. I struck up a conversation with ""Lucy"" and everything was going fine. We began talking about history - a vice of mine - and she told me about the origins of ""The V"" for those that don't know, in the UK instead of flipping someone the bird you give them the V which is holding your index and middle finger in a V shape with your palm facing inwards, essentially means ""*fuck off*."" (if anyone is curious to the origin I can explain the comments)

Once she told me the origin I was fascinated and googled it to find out more and began reading what I found to continue the conversation with more information. This is when Lucy's tone completely shifted and she asked me, quite sternly,  
Lucy ""did you not fucking believe me or something?""  
Me ""...Sorry?""  
Lucy ""you heard me, why did you feel the need to fact check me?""                                                                          Me ""I wasn't fact checking you I was...""                                                                                                                      Lucy ""Shut the fuck up (insert word i'm probably not allowed to type)""

Then she got up and stormed off, the other people around us saw what happened and were just as confused as I was, but we kinda shrugged it off and continued as normal. I was thinking about her reaction all night and it definitely put a downer on it for me.

The next day I asked my friend - ""Ben"" - who knew her if she had said anything about yesterday and Ben said that Lucy had reached out to him and proclaimed that I am a ""huge piece of shit and I know what I did."" Ben asked me what I did and I told him and he was just as confused as I am.

He told me to post on here to get the opinions of internet strangers.

So, AITA for ""fact checking"" someone? I don't think I did anything wrong but maybe I did and am willing to listen/learn from it!

6,1eh2e1d,AITA for feeding my neighbor's cat and wanting to continue doing so?,"The house down the road recently got a kitten, which would be great, but they’ve left it outside near a busy road since the first week. Although there aren’t many cars, those that do speed through, and there are many seagulls in the area which it seems scared of.

The kitten is still quite small and with a collar that seems too tight and it spends most of its time outside even in the heat. I’ve petted it a few times, and it’s one of the friendliest cats ever, that absolutely loves pets and goes for them at full force, which makes me feel worse about its situation.

Tonight, while getting food for my pets, I bought a single pouch for the neighbor’s cat and fed it on my way home. When I called it over and opened the pouch on the grass, it eagerly went for the food but seemed nervous about something else taking it—not about me, as it kept glancing behind and it was beside it.

I thought it was a kind gesture and planned to feed it occasionally after work, possibly carrying treats that my own cats like. My partner agrees it’s a good idea, but my dad warned it might upset the neighbors, who aren’t the friendliest.

8,1eh284s,AITA for asking our neighbor to move her car so our daughter can park in front of our house ,"Ok so my family and I (F, 36,  family of 5) moved into our home 4 years ago. Our neighbors across the street from us have 8 people living in their home, the 2 homeowners who work, their daughter, and her 5 kids. The daughter, 40, her 5 kids, 3 of whom are college age. Between 8 of them, there are  6 cars. And 3 never move from the street 
The homeowner works early and asks that no one parks behind them. So 4 cars sit out in front of other people's homes. (Their home has a fire hydrant in front) 
For 4 years we let them park in front of our house, but often have to ask them to move when we have bad weather because of the trees over our driveway falling on my car once. 
Our other neighbors have started calling the city and reporting the 3 college kids cars because they won't move for weeks at a time. We have never reported the car in front of our house. The local law states they can be there for no longer than 24 hours without moving

Today, we were having bad weather so I asked her to have her daughter move her car and then said, and can you please have her start parking it somehwere else because our daughter is getting a car in 2 weeks and she will need that spot. 

She wrote back saying that they can't really move their car because of her parents cars and that they have 8 people living there and that we could shuffle around cars in our driveway if we really needed an extra spot. But that we should let her know when we actually have a car for our daughter, and then she will have her daughter move hers. 

I responded with, unfortunately, we still need that spot. I'm sorry things are so cramped ay your house, but we would like to be able to park in front of our house and start using that spot.

She got so upset telling me she hopes one day I have to juggle 6 cars and 8 people in one home.

I just said thanks for being so understanding. 

When she got home, she sent me a bunch of messages about how we don't need that spot right now, we have a driveway, and proceeded to tell me how to arrange our cars. 

I wrote back with, all we wanted to do was use the spot in front of our own home. 

She said again that we didn't need it. 
I told her she was being childish 
She sent a bunch of emojis and I said that the fact that multiple neighbors had called the cops and I asked nicely, but she was losing her mind over it, told me she was entitled. 
To which she responded, you don't own the street. It's the cities. 
And I said, you're right. But I do own my home and if you owned one of your own, this wouldn't be an issue.""

So, am I the asshole?

EDIT:
I think people need more background info, so here it goes:

Our neighbors will have their guests block our driveway when it's late at night because they don't want theirs used. Sometimes, I have to go ask them to move their cars, just to leave my house. They respond with. Sorry, it's late, we didn't think you would need to leave. 
Other times we have come home on vacation, and had our driveway blocked, again, because they didn't think we needed it. 

Our elderly neighbors have in home health care, and the  nurse has to carry everything from down the street to get to their home because there is no parking. 
The same elderly family had an ambulance come one time and all hell broke loose because there was nowhere for it to park. It couldn't turn into their drive because the neighbors were partially blocking it. Guess why, because they're old and probably don't need to leave their house. 
The ambulance had to block the road to be able to get to the home since no street parking was available. 

These people are very aware that they're parking in spots they shouldn't, and are waiting for other people to do something about it before they make any efforts. 

I rest my case.

(UPDATE)
The homeowner came over and apologized saying her daughter is very entitled and they all knew one day we would need that spot like we asked, and said she would tell her daughter to calm down.)

I had to block the daughters number because she would not stop messaging me.

Decided I'm TAH. But I'm 1000% ok with it.

It’s a great neighborhood with strangers that wave to each other & I truly enjoy the energy & way everyone just gets along. 
I do however, have one neighbor. He’s a 40 something M with a wife & 2 kids. Me & this guy have a bit of a “history”. Nothing really confrontational, but he lets his big boxer out loose in his front yard all the time & just “lets her get the zoomies out” & she would end up coming to my yard and fence, making my dogs go mental. (Which makes zero sense because they have a huge backyard)
 So only really friendly reminders, cause I don’t want to see a dog or kid get run over. He has a slightly annoying aloofness & lack of awareness that I’m not too keen on.  
1 kid is a teenager who is constantly bringing his various reptiles across the street to show me when I’m doing yard work. I’m talking a python, bearded lizard, & frogs so far.  (This started out cool & gradually got weirder because it was like he would wait for me to be doing yard work )

And look, like I said I don’t have children, & I don’t think it’s wrong for a baby or kid to just run around like that around the privacy of their home.

11,1eh1q2n,AITA for talking to the director’s young daughter?,"I (15F) am in our local high school’s musical production of “Shrek”. We have kids ranging from 3rd (I believe) all the way to seniors in high school. 

The director’s daughter is in fourth grade I believe and has been active in the theater community in our school, before she was allowed to perform in any play or musical she would come and assist her mom (the director/music teacher). 

As the show comes closer everyone has been increasingly more tense and more strict on the backstage rules (like little to no talking and no phones, food or drink). Many kids have been breaking the talking rule, which I will admit I have as well. But the director’s daughter has been talking backstage, not listening to the directors and her upperclassmen. 

For example, she has been very rude to some kids (6-8 grade) about them “being in her way” when they were only in their correct spots. 

Today she was asked by a senior to move where the rest of the cast were for that specific scene so then she wouldn’t been seen through the backdrops and she told the senior “I don’t have to listen to you”. The senior came by the other group of cast members to calm down a bit before going back by the other group. 

So after that scene was over I went to change my costume and I saw director’s daughter, so I brought it up. My voice remained calm and mellow the whole conversation, I just said that instead of being rude to people who are giving her constructive criticism and asking her to move for the sake of scene cohesiveness that she should be polite and tell them why she think she was right. 

I was thanked by two separate people for talking to her because she has been rude the whole time to literally everyone, including her mother. 

For the rest of the day the director’s daughter ignored me but when she came by my friends (who then asked her to please go away or to stop touching them or asking for food) and I asked her to listen to them she covered her ears and did the little “lalallalalala” thing all kids do.

For context: 
We all love kpop. I met my best friend on tiktok, to be more specific on February 5th. And I met my girlfriend there too I don't remember the day but it was after I met my best friend. My girlfriend was always jealous of my best friend but it's not my fault if I love my best friend more than my girlfriend, I tried to never show this detail. Supposedly my girlfriend was 16 years old and she was the one who encouraged me to enter kpop houses on Zangi.

Important details: 
We only met on the internet.
My girlfriend was acting strange, we no longer made calls and she didn't send me many videos on tiktok like she used to do.

After entering on houses in Zangi, I entered some on WhatsApp, but my dad found out, he just let me stay in the houses. One day an online friend called me and I went to my room to answer, but after hanging up my father asked me who called me and I didn't lie to him. After that he got angry and told my mother about that. I had to block this girl and for safety I left the WhatsApp houses and uninstalled Zangi. As I still had my conversations on tiktok so I sent her a message explaining what happens and saying that she could break up with me and we did it. After that she told me that she lied about her age (something I already suspected) but didn't tell me her real age. In other words, she is a child. I talked and still talk to my virtual friends in other places other than whatsapp. So my girlfriend still sent me videos and I sent her. Now is the part when my best friend comes in! Today I published a video on tiktok ""my bias VS my best friend's bias"" and my ex girlfriend saw it. She sent me a message saying: ""who let you have more friends"" ""I'm very sad with you"" I answered: ""Are you talking about the video I published?? Girl she is my best friend I can't stop being friends with her because I love her so much and if you don't like sorry but my friendships are my friendships!"" Than she wrote: ""than be with her"" ""let me go"". Than she commented in one of my old posts ""I'm still waiting for a video today, just your ""friend"", so okay..."" (for context of this part: A while ago I posted a video talking about my best friend and she saw it, I said that I can do one for her but she said that it wasn't necessary, I said I was going to do it, but I ended up not publishing it and we broke up). I sent a screenshot of everything to my best friend and she sent a message to my ex-girlfriend. My best friend (in my opinion) slayed on what her says and then my ex send me a message ""NOW YEAH WE DON'T HAVE A FRIENDSHIP ANYMORE"" ""BYE *my real name* FORGET ME"" ""I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU TOLD TO THAT CLUELESS GIRL"" ""NOW GO ASK THAT FRIEND ON A DATE"" and then she blocked me.

I (22F) work for a lady, who took in her friend (80somethingMale) after he had a stroke. I help out with chores in the house and also more physical things involving the 80 something year old man, while the lady is gone. I’m basically one of many sitters she has. I help him get up and walk around with his walker. I also sometimes help him to use the restroom. 

He has told me in the past that I am good looking, and if I had considered a modelling career. He really likes me as a caregiver that I know, because he’s told me that he tells his friends about me.

14,1eh1j0m,AITA for giving my friend the cold shoulder for spilling one of my biggest secrets to her friend on my birthday?,"this all happened a couple of days ago. i had a cake cutting for my birthday with my two friends DJ and Stephanie. as we were chatting, DJ confessed to me that she had been keeping a secret from me for awhile. 

for context, i have a stalker account on instagram. it is not used for any creepy things like DMing inappropriate things to other users  or scamming. i also use it for stalking shows i watch and seeing edits as I don’t really want it on my main because this takes up almost my whole fyp and i like having other reels like cooking so i keep it separate. it is also just an account i used to view stories and posts anonymously. the presumed gender for the account is he/him and the - school name’year -in the bio. 

apparently  DJ’s friend (Michelle) made a post awhile ago and one of her friends had commented “OMG MICHELLE U LOOK SO GOOD!!!” according to DJ, i had liked the comment on my stalker account (i went back to check to see if i had done this and i did not see a like from it. it’s possible i liked and unliked it by accident because i do have a habit of liking random comments by swiping fast on accident including on my main. i always unlike when i accidentally do though so i may have just forgot i had accidentally liked it). 
basically michelle saw this, got excited a boy thought she was pretty and immediately wanted to know who he was. i think since i liked the comment and unliked it quickly when i realized she got a notification. she screenshotted it and immediately sent it to a class group chat to try to figure it out. she also proceeded to tell DJ about this boy who thought she was pretty and DJ told her it was me and all about my secret account. 

i was kinda mad ngl because i don’t think that was her secret to share in the first place. DJ was adamant that Michelle was entitled to know because a random person liked the comment and is her friend. i thought my alliance to her would be stronger since we have been besties since fifth grade and are in the same friend group while DJ met Michelle in ninth grade, but i guess not. i don’t feel like that’s a very good reason because she promised me she wouldn’t tell anyone. the best example i can think of is a secret valentine. obviously if you receive one you’d like to know who it’s from but it’s secret so if someone knows they shouldn’t tell you unless the secret admirer is fine with it. it also bothered me that she didn’t ask if it’s fine. 

her argument was that it was 2 AM and i was asleep when they were texting. DJ apparently made Michelle promise not to snitch but i’ve met Michelle and she’s kinda a blabbermouth. she talks about MANY people. i’m sure i’m bound to be exposed.  DJ claims i’m just overreacting and it’s not big deal since Michelle has one too but the thing is NOBODY KNOWS MICHELLE’S. i’m honestly second guessing myself by her reaction. i know it wasn’t truly a big secret but it was for me. am i just overreacting?

Wife told me that she and her mother would be travelling to a wedding abroad in October.  This is the wedding of the daughter of a friend of my MIL, whom my wife has met maybe twice, the actual bride never.  MIL didn’t want to go alone and had a +1.  MIL wants to do more sightseeing after the wedding, so this has turned into a two-week trip, something wife has NEVER done with me and the kids.  It also conflicts with my annual meeting.   I asked if she was going to find a way to allow me to do my 3-day trip and she said that surely I could just skip it this year. 

Here’s where I may be the AH.  I told her it is important to the job that pays for the lifestyle she enjoys and noted that I am literally paying more in incremental taxes living where we do relative to previous place than she makes from her job.  She said that I just wanted to see my friends in DC.  I said, yes, it is emotionally edifying for me to see some friends in light of the social isolation that has been inflicted on me by her making me move to Bumpkinville, but this is business necessity.

In the end, I reached out to their former nanny, now retired, and made a deal to fly her here and pay her very well to watch the kids while I am gone.  And here is part two of potential AH behavior.  Wife a few days later asked me to look into buying tickets and renting a car for a visit to her family for Thanksgiving.  I said that since she could easily afford a two-week trip to India, and I had to pay a fortune to cover childcare during my trip, she can pay for this trip.  She whined that she doesn’t have enough money to cover it.  I said, well, maybe staying home for Thanksgiving this year would be better so as not to interfere with her very demanding job.

Recently, we've both started spending more time with our girlfriends. His girlfriend was practically living with us for over a month, using our washer/dryer, storing food in the fridge, etc. He even offered for her to move in and pay rent, but she declined. I told him I didn’t mind if she stayed over without paying rent.

Eventually, she started staying over less but still comes over after work until nighttime and stays over on weekends. I've never asked her to pay rent or contribute in any way. The only issue I raised was when his girlfriend was parking in the driveway, blocking both spots in the garage. I asked her to stop, she never responded but my roommate talked to her about it.

Recently, my girlfriend has been spending more time at our place, similar to how his girlfriend did before. After asking for my roommate if he uses the trash and if so to take it out more often, my roommate is asking that my girlfriend starts paying rent because she’s basically living here. I told him it wasn’t fair, especially since his girlfriend never paid rent. I also pointed out that we had a previous roommate (my sister) who stayed for free in exchange for cooking and cleaning.

The areas my girlfriend uses are mostly maintained by me and her, and her presence doesn't negatively affect my roommates' day-to-day lives. I offered to discuss a solution other than paying rent, including for her to chip in for utilities as long as his girlfriend does too, but my roommate said it was fine to continue as we were. However, today, I found his girlfriend blocking the garage again. I sent him a picture, to which he responded “she’ll be here for like 5 minutes, what’s the big deal?” I was upset at this and explained that I thought we had already talked about this, that it’s unfair to the people that use the garage, and that’s it’s disrespectful. He responded with “well it’s unfair that your girlfriend isn’t paying rent either”. I went to go talk to him in person about this but he was heading out to work. On his way, he texted me that it’s best for him and his brother to find another place to live.

18,1eh19ze,AITA for not reading my friend's mind?,"I (18F) and my friend James (18M) got blocked by our mutual friend Jess (18F). 

Fake names/ ages used for privacy reasons. 

A few weeks ago, I got a text from James, asking if Jess had blocked me. I checked and, blimey, she had blocked me!! I was confused, as we had seemed fine just before this. 

We had a few group chats over different social media.

For context, we used these group chats a lot, but we would leave the gcs silent for prolonged periods of time, as we all have lives beyond eachother. 

So on July 10th, I put a screenshot of a conversation between me, my bf, and James, on my private story. I do this quite often as I like to share things with my friends. 
Jess did the same thing, posted screenshots of conversations with friends, including James. 

Today, I found out the reason why Jess had blocked us. Through a conversation she had with James. 

She was complaining that we had constantly left her on opened on everything, and said how she knew we 'weren't busy' so we should’ve responded. Despite so much going on in both our lives, and not getting a chance to reply to the gc. 

She named this as one of the reasons why she had blocked the both of us. And she mentioned how she assumed we were shit talking her', as we weren't responding to the GC, but were responding to each other. 

Us not responding was one of the main reasons she blocked the both of us, however never outright told us she wanted the two of us to message her. 

Another reason she blocked me was due to jokes I made. 
In hindsight, I get how my jokes may have impacted her badly, however, she never specifically spoke to me and told me she was uncomfortable with it, asking to stop. 
If she outright messaged me and told me to cut it out, as I was being toxic, I 100% would have. 

Not trying to excuse my actions, but I struggle with social cues, so, had no idea how my jokes could have impacted her. 
I had been making these jokes since we met, years ago. 

She clearly just wanted me to read her mind and know what she was thinking. 

She would also put down mine and other peoples interests, if they didn't fit into her standards of what 'good' is. Which is not as important to the story, but a bit of extra context.
- I had been dealing with this for years, and got scared to even mention my interests to her in fear of being called weird for liking these things.

23,1egzmf7,AITA for posting about my gift “maternity box” on social media when my stepsister never got one for her son? ,"I recently had my first child. When we were discharged, the hospital sent us home with a “baby box.” It was a cute little box that can double as a bed and came with a mattress, some baby clothes and other essentials.

This caught me off guard because I live in the US. I thought this was only a thing in Finland. Turns out, the county I live in works with a charity that provides these boxes for all expecting moms. 

I was pretty stoked about this, so I made a post on Instagram showing it off. 

My stepmom messaged me and told me I should take down the post a few days later. She said it was in bad taste because a lot of new moms don’t get this perk. She pointed out that her daughter, my stepsister, has been very upset by this.

My stepsister did reach out, but her response was something like, “wow, I had my son, all the hospital sent me was some maxi pads and a bill. :angryfaceemoji:”

I didn’t down the post because I want to highlight the work that charity was doing. Especially for women in my area who may not be aware of the baby boxes and could really need it.

My stepsister sent me a DM telling me to take the post down. She said it’s unfair she has to struggle with a special needs baby while the other moms can gloat about how being a new mom is awesome. She said that she never got a free box or clothes or perfume like my cousin and everyone stopped caring one she had her son while me, my cousin and all our other relatives “get all the attention.” 

Right now, I’m leaning towards keeping the post up. I don’t live in the same state as my stepfamily but am aware of social programs designed to help parents with special needs kids. That or my stepsister get help or get counseling. But maybe that’s not the best move. AITA?

25,1egz75e,AITA for wanting my mother-in-law to treat me with equal respect?,"First post here, curious to hear anyone’s opinion. 

I’ve been in a relationship for the last 2 years w a Turkish girl. I’m European (Dutch), she’s Turkish, but her Mom grew up in Belgium (Flemish = Dutch) and spent 25 years of her life there before moving to Turkey. 

Issue: Although my girlfriend and I got along great, the relationship w her Mom has been a struggle. As a result, we (my gf and I) have fought regularly abt this. To summarize:

– Before meeting me, her Mom told her not to get too excited since “Europeans” never stick around in Turkey (I moved to Istanbul and lived there for a year to be with her)
– Her Mom had issues with me not being Muslim. Despite my girlfriend “barely” being Muslim (not practicing, doesn’t identify, etc), her Mom still found this to be an issue. 
– Her Mom criticized me repeatedly. She said I wasn’t responsible, wasn’t financially stable and wasn’t trustworthy. This came after I stressed that my gf should have a decent, average-paying job – but that that isn’t possible in Turkey (Turkish economy is ass). I work at top 3 tech firm and earn a very nice salary. This isn’t to brag, just want to share my shock / irritation upon hearing that I couldn’t financially “provide”, although I work at one of the top firms globally and earn a great salary. In contrast, her daughter can’t even afford her own apartment. 
– Her Mom got pissed when I didn’t congratulate her *on time* for their religious Muslim holiday. I sent her at 6pm to congratulate and called 3x but no reply. Never heard back. Mind you: I’m not Muslim and barely know the traditions.. Despite her 25 years in BE (Christian), she has never sent anything for Christmas, Easter etc. Not that it’s a problem for me, but feels like measuring with 2 different cups. 


It’s a short summary of a longer story. After many of these issues, I decided that I didn’t give a fuck anymore and ignored the Mom. After being disrespected, discriminated etc.. I was like: Whatever. Obv this wasn’t great for my gf, who’s tried to manage. 

Once in a while the topic comes up, but my gf continues to claim that her Mom loves me and cares so much; that it was only temporary and situational. I disagree; I hold a grudge and don’t give a fuck whether she cares or not.. If she can’t be bothered to send me for my holidays (I genuinely wouldn’t care otherwise but..), then why should I do the same.

27,1egyvil,AITA for Calling Out My Dad's Wife for Feeding Him 7-Hour-Old Oatmeal Instead of the Fresh Food I Made?,"I am a 55F. My Dad (83 M) had surgery last week to remove a cancerous tumor in his digestive tract.  

My Mom passed 
away 17 years ago and he married a younger woman who I have never been a fan of (feeling is definitely mutual)but I tolerate in order to have a relationship with my Dad. 

Since his surgery a week ago all he’s asked for is rice & beans - he’s 100% Irish but having been married 38 years to my Mom who was 100% Puerto Rican he absolutely LOVES Puerto Rican food. 

He’s been on basically a liquid diet until yesterday after a second procedure and was given the green light to eat  solid food.  He had a late lunch about 2pm. I immediately went home and cooked for him and my daughters brought it up to the hospital. 

She had my dad call me AT 5 to say he had eaten his hospital dinner and was full - less than 3 hours after he had lunch. My daughters had the nurses put it in the fridge - I had already put his name and the date on it. 

Visited this morning and he didn’t have an appetite- his hospital breakfast tray was sitting there and I had brought him breakfast from the diner as well….all he had was coffee. 

I left a note in his room and even asked the nurse assistant who came into his room if she could offer him the rice for lunch. I TEXTED his wife the same. 

Got this text to me/my siblings from the wife after she finally showed up to the hospital after 2 pm. 

Your Dad wasn't hungry today.
Around 2:00, he had oatmeal with chocolate chips & an Ensure Chocolate Protein Shake & a cup of tea. He is quite full now. He still has some pain/soreness. He is managing his pain without pain meds.

So I replied:

I hope not that oatmeal that was sitting out from this morning?

Her response:The oatmeal was covered & still good. It was super heated & melted his chocolate chips.

I called the nurses station to ask why my Dad would be allowed to eat food from a tray at least 6 hours old.

Turns out WIFE asked nurse to heat up the 7 hour old oatmeal - and HE ASKED FOR his RICE & BEANS and she (wife) just LAUGHED???!!!! 
Nurse told me she’s making sure tray is gone and she seemed a bit annoyed at the situation . She says she's going to heat it up and bring it to him.

I called  and spoke to him - I asked if his appetite was back and he told me he ate the oatmeal. Asked him why he didn’t eat the rice instead and he said he forgot. Which is NOT true bc the nurse told me he asked for it when wife asked to have the oatmeal heated up! 

I made sure to tell the nurse she fed him the old oatmeal absolutely on purpose so he wouldn’t eat the food I made ….Nurse is  aware He’s been asking for rice & beans. I didn’t  tell her initially what it was I just said I dropped off dinner to him last night and it’s in the fridge. She asked ME if it was rice !!!!

Pretty sure feeding an elderly man hours old food that was sitting in a window just to be spiteful is proof who the asshole is.

28,1egyqro,AITA for suggesting we move away from my dad?,"Hello everyone! I (17F) am my parents oldest child. I’m originally from a country in Latin america, but moved to the US a year ago (therefore please forgive any grammatical mistakes i might make). The move wasn’t really what i wanted but my parents decided it would be the best option for our family, despite the idea coming mainly from my father (56M). 
In this last year, my health (both mental and physical) has gotten worse. I’ve lost count of how many nights i’ve cried myself to sleep because i miss my family, my friends and my country, i’ve never felt so alone. Now i think it is important to mention that my father is VERY closed minded and even outdated in the way of thinking/seeing the family’s dynamics, and i would say he is a very rude guy. My mom, on the other hand, is SUPER sweet and open minded, but i see how bad my dad’s words affect her. My dad is verbally abusing towards my mom, me and my siblings… he always comments on our weights (saying how fat i’m getting - for reference- i’m 143 pounds and 5.5’), how bad we are doing something and ever made me buy bleach for my arm hair because it was “disgusting” (his words). I honestly don’t know how long i can keep up with this, my hair is falling off, my weight is going up and i pray all night asking God to help us leave this environment. I just want to go home, away from my dad. And that’s what i told my mom and she was very upset about it. I’m not sure why, if it is because she doesn’t want this or if she feels bad for us. 
I honestly don’t even know how to deal with this, i do work but only part time and my money goes towards my expenses, so i can’t even buy myself a plane ticket back home and even if i could, i wouldn’t want to leave mom and siblings behind. I wish i could just fix everything but i can’t. I don’t know how to go about it, so i need some advice. I am mentally and physically drained. We do have family back home but i feel embarrassed asking for help or advice, because they probably don’t even know what we are going through here. I just hope my comment didn’t hurt my mom, because i know how hard she works for us to live the way we do. Would i be an asshole for going NC with my dad if this all goes well?

29,1egypdc,AITA for not buying my friends more gifts for their baby shower?,"Two of my very good friends are having their first baby and the shower is a little over two weeks away. The annoucement went out near the beginning of the year and they had a registry where people can by them gifts as most couples do. This past weekend, they had a member of the family send everyone who is invited a message asking everyone to bring diapers and a book for the baby. Normally I would be fine with it, but the announcement went out a while ago and so I would assume most of the guests have already gotten gifts. 

To me, I don't think it is fair to ask guests to get more gifts when most of them may already have purchased them. It seems a little greedy to me. ""Yes, you are already bringing gifts, but we realized diapers are expensive AF and want to take advantage of everyone coming to buy them for us."" It does not feel right to me.

AITA for thinking that any gifts I already bought should be sufficient, or am I being too cheap and selfish? It is not so much about the money to me as it is the principle of gratitude for what guests are already offering you.

  
Feel free to ask any clarifying questions.

30,1egykd2,AITA for asking my husband to stop peeing in the shower unless he is going to be the one to clean it ? ,"Pretty straightforward. I’ve never had a problem keeping my shower clean in my life until I began living with my husband. I always cleaned the shower regularly (1x week) and almost never had to go out of my way to clean the decorative shower curtain other than spring cleaning time. 

Now that pink bacteria scum loves to live on the base of the shower and even our decorative (outer) shower curtain. 

I am the one who does all of the laundry and 90% of the household cleaning and I have asked my husband to stop peeing in the shower because I think it is part of what causes the build up. We also have a stall shower with a curtain, so I know it’s likely spraying outside of the shower. I don’t think I’d care as much if it was in our shower/tub combo. 

To be clear, I do not think anything is inherently wrong with peeing in the shower. I’ve just asked my husband politely several times now not to do it unless he wants to be the one to clean up all the pink scum. He gets really defensive every time. I just thought it was a really simple request that would make a difference to me, so why is it such a big deal? 

So that’s it. AITA for gatekeeping the shower peeing experience from my husband in our stall shower? 

UPDATE: 
Thanks to everyone who has chimed in! My husband and I have had the best time going through this thread 😂 Reddit never ceases to amaze me. 

My husband says that he would rather stop peeing in the shower than be the one to clean it. So take that for what it is worth. If nothing else, he is going to stop so that we can see if it contributes to the film— although we both know now that it is probably just poor ventilation or our hygiene products.

31,1egyk9m,AITAH for refusing to pick up a friend from airport and drop him off at someone else’s place,"To establish background, a friend of mine(Tyler) who I(27M) consider to be a really close friend is moving to my city. There are three other friends of ours who live in this city- one of whom(Kate) I don’t get along with due to her disrespectful behaviour in the past. I have established clear and strong boundaries with that person. The friend flying in and the other friends in the city(Lily & Josh) are aware of my boundaries. 
 
I reached out to Tyler a month ago to check his travel plans and offered him to pick him up from airport and stay at my place for a few days before he settles in the new city. Lily made a travel plan over the upcoming weekend for her family, Josh, Tyler and me to celebrate Tyler coming to town.  Tyler was asked about this and green flagged it until recently when he learnt change in his schedule and backed out of travel. 

I called Tyler to discuss this and offered him to pick him up and drop him to his place the same day by taking the day off work so that I could help him in errands. I didn’t feel like taking multiple days off work because I was already going to the trip that extends until Tuesday. However, if Tyler asked me to I wouldn’t have said no to staying with him for multiple days. Tyler agreed and even told me that he can just Uber from airport to not trouble me. 

Today I called Tyler and shockingly learnt that he is disappointed in Lily, Josh and me for booking the trip without his consent( he clearly said yes in chat). And asked me to drop him at Kate’s place. I refused to take PTO just to drop him off at Kate’s place and I told him Kate can pick him up if she wants to. But she doesn’t have a car. Kate called him yesterday after seeing his insta stories asking about his plans after landing. On the other hand, I had elaborate plans of taking Tyler to some must visit restaurants in the city straight from the airport.

33,1egy3se,AITA for making my sister pick up her cats,"So my sister had a mental break down (she had them often, usually in situations she brings upon herself) and broke her lease to move in with my mom. My mom and her gf have their own apartment. Mom’s gf told sister she could move into her apartment with her cats and she would move in with my mom. Sis would takeover her lease. Under those pretense my sister agreed and uprooted her life and moved to our city. My sister has mental break down often. I usually just let her ride it out and she eventually stops and continues her life. Some are genuine, some are her just throwing a fit over messes she causes in other people’s life which in turn makes her feel bad and she cried about it. Both her and my mom are emotional abusers. I recognized this early as a child and learned to keep my emotions to myself so I don’t make them angry or cry. When I did I would feel bad becauseI know they are super sensitive and I just learned to be nicer or not say anything at all. 

Anyways my sister moved here and my mom gf changes her mind, decides she wants a house. She is also manipulative and just using this situation to her advantage. She knows my mom wants to live together. But now she doesnt want to move twice, so she’s not moving until they can get a house together (my mom gets VA checks and loans. She could never get a house on her own). Cause of this my sister now has no place to live besides with my mother. My mother says no unless I watch the cats. I am allergic to the cats. Not deathly allergic and I lived with them before so I decided for a couple weeks I will manage. It turns out to be too much and within a couple weeks I’m miserable with itchy rashes. Any time I am in contact with them I have to disinfect myself sef before going back to my room. I don’t own a washer so I cant wash as much as I need to get rid of cat hair. A month passes. Girlfriend decides sister can move into her place again. A day passes. Girlfriend changes her mind. Im fed up. I text my mother and tell her they need to come get the cats. She says no cause cats dont like her girlfriend. I remind her that I’m literally sick. She says no because she doesnt want cat hair all over the place and threatened they will be taken to a shelter instead. She says this anytime I ask can they come live either her. So I double down and say fine, take them. Deep down I do not mean it and feel like a terrible person because they are just babies who don’t deserve to be in a shelter.

I did decide to wait until I was done growing to start buying more expensive clothes, since it seemed pointless to spend a lot of money on something I'll outgrow. 

At 17, I was 5'9, and my doctor told me that due to growth patterns and the fact both of my parents are short (5'7 and 5'3), I was probably done growing. I decided to start buying some cool clothes and have cheated a nice wardrobe. 

Recently, I have noticed some of them now seem a bit small on me length wise, and I decided to measure myself. It turns out I'm now 5'11.

I contacted my doctor and he said that when I was younger, my projected height was 6'1-6'2 but then my growth slowed down but maybe I'm having late growth spurt and might reach that height. 

This annoyed me, because if I grow 2-3 more inches, almost none of my clothes-- totalling a worth of several thousands of dollars-- will truly fit me anymore without extensive and expensive tailoring. I was telling this to a friend, and she accused me of humblebragging since being taller is a good/attractive trait for men.

I don't think I am humblebragging, because having to either pay a lot of money to convert my wardrobe or to rebuild my wardrobe all again is more important and a nhsiance than getting taller is.

36,1egxph3,AITA for not going on a family trip? ,"18m. (Specifically her my dad doesn’t care) my mum wants me to come on this family trip she’s planning, and the house she’s looking to book requires we state how many people are going before she books it. It’s some place we’ve been before. 

Issue is we’d be going Thursday the 15th until the Monday and A-level results day is on the 15th and I think there’s chance I’ll have to go through clearing to get to uni. 

For Americans or the like reading I’ll quickly explain the importance of this for context, skip if unnecessary. At 16 you choose 3 A-levels, these can be any subjects you like. You do these for Two years doing a couple exams for each subject at the end of each year that dictate your grades which you get the results on “results day”. So you don’t know how you did until that day because everything rides on these few exams. 

Before this in January you apply for max 5 degree choices, (so all 5 at the same uni or 5 across multiple) then they may or may not give you an “offer” for example the offer for my firm choice is AAB for a degree in computer science. I’m currently studying Maths, Physics and Digital technology so for example I’d need an A in maths, A in physics and B in digital Technology. If you don’t get these on results day offer is voided and you have to go through “clearing” phoning and emailing to try and get on a degree that’s not full up if you meet the minimum requirements. 

So I want that day and the following to be clear for me to sort everything out that I need to. My mother is upset and annoyed with me because she says I can just do it while we are there which I’d rather not and that she doesn’t know how much she’ll be seeing me if I go to uni so she wants this and kept saying basically how extra I was being. And yes it actually doesn’t suit for everyone to go later on has to be this slot.

My mother is upset and annoyed with me because she says I can just do it while we are there which I’d rather not and that she doesn’t know how much she’ll be seeing me if I go to uni so she wants this and kept saying basically how extra I was being. And yes it actually doesn’t suit for everyone to go later on has to be this slot.

39,1egx29r,AITA for wanting a longer honeymoon when his parents are coming from overseas,"My fiancé and I met here in Aus when he came over for work experience 6years ago. He spent 3 years back in the UK over Covid but came back for work in 2022 and that’s when we relinked, dated and are now set to get married end of November! 

His immediate family are coming over for the wedding (a couple of weeks beforehand) and leaving 6 days after. Initially we had booked the honeymoon for 3 days (married on Sat, honeymoon sun - Tuesday, back to work Wednesday) because he was going to be very busy at work at that time of year, but there were some changes at his work which means he isn’t busy anymore so I asked if we could have a few days extra on the honeymoon. He’s not keen because 1) he “can’t get anymore time off work” (he’s taking the entire time from his family getting here) and 2) he wants to spend the last few days with his family and take them to the airport because he won’t see them for another 9 months at least. 

I really get that he’s making this massive move away from his whole family to be with me, but AITA for wanting to go on a slightly longer honeymoon (coming back the day before his family leave)? I mean, he’s spending 2 weeks before the wedding with them (I’m working full time right through till the wedding so no time off), and you only really get one chance at a honeymoon (unless you’re planning on getting married multiple times ig).

42,1egwn7o,AITA for encouraging my brother-in-law to seek a second opinion?,"This is a bit of a complicated story so I will try and be brief without leaving out important detail. My BIL recently announced to the family through a FaceBook post that he had been diagnosed with Autism. He wrote what is almost an entire novel of a post about how this is something that has followed him through his life since his childhood but he’d always done well in school and at work and was never examined for it, but now as an adult (in his 50’s) he was curious and sought out an official diagnosis. This is after my brother, married to my BIL, sought out a diagnosis for his ADHD which the family always knew him to have as we nearly all have it. 

The response was overall positive towards my BIL. However I was skeptical because I just don’t see this pattern for him, and I was worried that specifically seeking out a specific diagnosis tilts the bias towards giving you that disorder. I said as such, that I just really did not see him as having Autism, as after all he’s had a very successful career in his field… he was in the Navy as a pilot for many years, and I feel they would have screened and disqualified him, or he shouldn’t have been able to handle the situations such a career would demand. Even now he runs his own business and is very personable and charismatic. 

I suggested he seek out another opinion, just as friendly advice. He told me he went to a well regarded individual for this diagnosis - the same who diagnosed my brother - and it involves testing which takes up an entire day, and that he was quite satisfied with the process. I told him if you walk in saying it, of course they’re going to see what you want. I’ve since been absolutely inundated with reply’s from his and my brother’s friends, some even going so far to call me a nasty person and accusing me of knowing nothing about Aspergers. One woman in particular got particularly heated with me and my BIL has removed me from being able to comment on his post and has reached out to me asking me to stop, but hasn’t responded if he’s done similarly with his so called friend.

44,1egw996,AITAH for being pissed about being uninvited. ,"So little back story: I (26f) met my boyfriend (24m) almost a year ago while traveling Australia. Our relationship got pretty serious pretty quickly and we moved in together while living and working out there. We’ve been back in England now a few month and living long distance. 

We’ve been debating about a situation and I just need to know if I’m the arsehole…
 
A few weeks back my boyfriend invited to a weekend away with all of his friends. This involved girls and boys which I have met and got on with all of them. 
I was looking forward to this as we haven’t done much since being back in England except work so a little get away would have been nice since his going traveling  again soon with his friends. 
He called me yesterday and let me know that I am now no longer invited to this.  I felt really dishearten and confused on why he had changed his mind on me coming. 
When I let him know that this had upset me he basically called me silly for feeling sad about it. 
He told me that one his friends didn’t want me there so I could now no longer come.  The reasoning behind it was his friend wanted my boyfriend alone to get drunk and party with(this friend is single). The other friends were happy for me to join. 
 
I said I don’t understand why his letting his friend dictate weather I come and I find it immature. My thought is; he should want me around and respect me and our relationship enough to say I already invited her so if she’s not welcome I don’t want to be there!

45,1egvqri,AITA for making a cake for my SIL?,"Sorry, english is not my first language.
So I (23/F) and my boyfriend (23/M) are together for almost 8 years, and recently we moved to a new city where his sister’s lives, because of my boyfriend’s work.
I don’t have a job yet, so in my free time I like to bake things, such as cakes, cupcakes, cookies, ect...
Two days ago was my SIL (29/F) who I will call Erica (not real name) birthday, and I baked a cake for her as a birthday gift. This was the first time, because before that we lived almost 2 hours away from each other.
Erica has a fiance, John (27/M, not real name), and they have an 8 month old daughter.
Erica is a SAHM, so she takes care of the baby while John is at work. And because the baby is teething, she has quite difficult and stressful days, and unfortunately it was the same on her birthday, so we could only go to her much later than we planned.
Me and my boyfriend go to their house a little before 6PM with friends and some family member, and wished for her a happy birthday. She loved my cake and thanked for the gifts.
We talked about 30 minutes when John arrived home from work and saw that we sat at the kitchen table with the birthday cake and gifts, and realized that he had forgotten his own fiance's birthday, although they have been together for already 10 years! 
Instead of making excuses, he just started to cursing at us, for making him look bad and humiliating him because he didn’t brought any gift.
Erica said that it’s not a big deal and just join us, but John was fuming, and he was particularly angry because of the cake. I think it was because we all know that Erica loves cakes, and she also loved to bake before their daughter was born.
He said that at least we could have reminded him about her fiance’s birthday, and tried to push down the cake from the table while still shouting at us, but luckily one of our friends saved it.
After failing, he turned to me and poked  his finger in my face and said the I am an a**hol for not including him in the planning, and make a fool out of him in front of others, than he stormed out of the house.
The night was ruined, we have never seen this side of John, so it was pretty awkward after that. The rest of the group apologized and went home, me and my boyfriend stayed for a few hours just to keep her company, when John arrived home, and saw us, he started fuming again.
On the way to their bedroom he asked me that why are me and my stupid cake is still there, so SIL politely asked us to go home.

Today my SIL called me, and apologized again, although it was unnecessary, and said that she spoke with John and she asked him to apologized too, but he hasn’t called or come to us yet.

We saw that John is a great dad, and a great partner, and this was the first time when we ever saw that side of him, even his fiance. He was never even angry at Erica, just felt stupid because he can’t remember dates. But I think his reaction was still a little extreme and hurtful.

46,1egvqqf,AITA? Husband/Friend Group Issues ,"I have been in a friend group that fully developed my senior year of high school. (2011-2012) There is a core group of four of us, and it is incredibly intertwined. Recently another acquaintance of the core four (let’s call her #5) has came out and told me that the three core friends have been lying to me. 

Apparently 6 ish years ago my then long time boyfriend who I had recently bought a house with made a pass at one of the core three (lets call her #1) over a facebook message after a long night of all of us drinking at our new house. He is now my husband whom I’ve been with for over 10 years married almost two… the message to #1 said something along the lines of she should come back out to our garage and hang out more he wanted to kiss her. #1 and my husband spoke the next day he claims he told her it was a mistake and asked her not to tell me. #1 agreed to keep this a secret from me. She then turned around and told the other two members of the core four(let’s call them #2 & #3) and #5. I am devastated she had the audacity to spread this to the other girls but couldn’t have enough respect to share it with me. The messages have since been deleted, i wont ever know exactly what was said or what happened while they were in our garage alone together. When #5 told me about this instance i confronted #1 & my husband separately & they both claimed #5 to be crazy & they had no idea what she was talking about. Come to find out #1 also went out of her way to text my husband to further confirm with him the lies they would be continuing.

Overall i feel like #1, #2, & #3 are all to be held accountable for keeping my husband’s secret from me. #1 claims she was “protecting me” and #s 2 & 3 claim they thought she told me. Mind you there is no privacy … clearly … when it comes to the core four. So if i would have know about this #s 2 & 3 would have known. 
I obviously was very taken aback by not only my husband’s actions back then but the fact that none of my girls cared enough to think i deserved the truth. I now feel so alone and like i cannot trust any of them. Ive told them this and its almost like im being irrational. I keep getting responses like it was so long ago / everything is different now /i thought you knew / i was protecting you /she told you this out of spite to hurt you

Am I the asshole here ? Or should I say am i overreacting ? Ive chosen as of right now to focus inward & leave additional conversations with the core four to be had after i address my relationship with my husband. We’ve started therapy, but i fear this is going to be a long road for us. How am I going to get over that feeling like my husband is attracted to someone i considered my best friend. Turning to a forum like this is so out of my comfort zone but I feel so alone in this & am honestly too embarrassed to lean on others outside of this situation.

He is now my husband whom I’ve been with for over 10 years married almost two… the message to #1 said something along the lines of she should come back out to our garage and hang out more he wanted to kiss her. #1 and my husband spoke the next day he claims he told her it was a mistake and asked her not to tell me. #1 agreed to keep this a secret from me. She then turned around and told the other two members of the core four(let’s call them #2 & #3) and #5. I am devastated she had the audacity to spread this to the other girls but couldn’t have enough respect to share it with me. The messages have since been deleted, i wont ever know exactly what was said or what happened while they were in our garage alone together. When #5 told me about this instance i confronted #1 & my husband separately & they both claimed #5 to be crazy & they had no idea what she was talking about. Come to find out #1 also went out of her way to text my husband to further confirm with him the lies they would be continuing.

Overall i feel like #1, #2, & #3 are all to be held accountable for keeping my husband’s secret from me. #1 claims she was “protecting me” and #s 2 & 3 claim they thought she told me. Mind you there is no privacy … clearly … when it comes to the core four. So if i would have know about this #s 2 & 3 would have known. 
I obviously was very taken aback by not only my husband’s actions back then but the fact that none of my girls cared enough to think i deserved the truth. I now feel so alone and like i cannot trust any of them. Ive told them this and its almost like im being irrational. I keep getting responses like it was so long ago / everything is different now /i thought you knew / i was protecting you /she told you this out of spite to hurt you

Am I the asshole here ? Or should I say am i overreacting ? Ive chosen as of right now to focus inward & leave additional conversations with the core four to be had after i address my relationship with my husband. We’ve started therapy, but i fear this is going to be a long road for us. How am I going to get over that feeling like my husband is attracted to someone i considered my best friend. Turning to a forum like this is so out of my comfort zone but I feel so alone in this & am honestly too embarrassed to lean on others outside of this situation.

47,1egvo6u,AITA for not calling my dad’s wife on Mother’s Day? ,"I'm sure the title says it all, but I want to share a little backstory and see what others think.

I have five siblings, and my dad briefly dated his now-wife when I was a small child. She couldn’t handle being around all five of us—we were horrendous children—and broke up with him. She chose not to have any children of her own. My dad and she rekindled their relationship and got married when I was a teenager. I'm the youngest of five, so the rest of my siblings were out of the house by then.

She’s like a sour patch of a woman. There’s no nurturing in her and no motherly instincts. She gets annoyed with small kids and doesn’t like messes. She’s got a ""vomit of the mouth"" and loves to blurt out really mean things to my siblings and me constantly when we are around her. For example, she told my sister things like, ""I wish your father and I could have bought a boat instead of having to put you through college."" But then she can be kind, buying nice Christmas presents, and at a few points in my life, she even had really great advice. However, she moved my dad to another state, away from us and his 14 grandkids, because she couldn’t take the heat in Florida. 🤣 So she’s still an awful woman.

She married my father in May, and Mother's Day was two weeks later. She wrote us all a nasty email about not calling her for Mother’s Day and how horrible we are. For the record, we have our own mother. They've been married for about 20 years, and I can’t, for all the tea in China, bring myself to call her or send her a card on Mother’s Day. My dad calls us every year and begs us to call her, but I can’t do it. She’s not my mom, nor is she a mother at all. If she had her own children and was actually a mom, I would have zero issues saying it. Over the years, people have said to me, ""One simple phrase can’t kill you. It will make her happy.""

After the trip, he told me that it was a really fun day but a little awkward because he started venting about life and what he wanted.

49,1egvc8p,AITA For not letting my GF use shared funds for a vacation,"My GF (27F) and I (32M) have been together for 2 years.  We moved into an apartment together about 2 months ago.  We both like to travel so we set up a shared account that we both contribute to that we decided we would use exclusively for travel.  When we set up the account, I was under the assumption that this travel fund would be used for trips we take together.  It never even crossed my mind that it would be used for solo trips.  But, apparently my GF thought otherwise.

She is currently planning a girls-trip with some friends of hers.  She was talking to me about cost and said that there is just about enough in the travel fund for her entire trip.  When we first set up the fund, we both individually deposited a fairly large lump sum to get the account started.  I have set up direct deposits of a much smaller amount to go into the fund every paycheck.  It's only been a few pay periods since I did that, but I know I've put more in there than she has because I have more disposable income.  

I brought it up to her that I thought this was a shared trip fund, not money that we would take out for individual trips.  She said that she would replenish the fund with higher deposits after the trip to compensate for what she takes out.  I told her I don't feel comfortable with that and that she should use her own separate money to fund her trip.  She said that she wouldn't be able to go then.  I told her that if she can't afford it on her own, she shouldn't go.  I don't want to fund her solo trips. 

She got upset with me and accused me of not trusting her to replenish the account.  I told her I do trust her, but that money should be used for shared travel only.  I told her I know exactly how much I put in there and I don't want my money used for her trips.

I told her that it's partially my fault for assuming that fund would be used only for shared trips, but it doesn't make any sense to me that we would use shared funds for individual travel.  I asked her if she would be OK with me draining the account for a boys trip and she told me as long as I replenish it she would be fine with it.

I said that if she wants to use the money she already put into that account for her trip, then she can take exactly that amount out.  But I don't want her using any of my money for her solo trip. She accused me of being controlling and not wanting her to have fun on a girls' trip.  She asked if I'm worried about her cheating and I told her of course not because I trust her.  She then asked what the problem is if I trust her not to cheat I should trust her to replenish the account.  

I told her that maybe setting up that account was a mistake and that I will just take my money out of the account and she can use whatever is left for her solo trip.  She got mad and told me that I should be more trusting of her and that I am making her out to be a bad partner over nothing.

50,1eguurf,AITA for so-called intruding my now ex friend and his prom date? ,"I got into an argument for with one of my best friends from high school. During the argument, he mentioned that he dislikes me because in his words: “you followed me and my girlfriend around prom and I didn’t even get to be alone with her the entire time and I hardly have any pictures without you in it” 

This is technically true, but I can explain; for prom, I had initially wanted to go with a girl who was a friend of mine. He knew about this, we were talking about our prom plans and I told him I was gonna get a table with her. But the girl in question told me that she was bringing her older sister (who missed out on prom) to the table along with her. And because of this I changed my mind about going to prom with her. It’s not even because I wanted her to myself or anything. I just dislike her sister and it would be awkward. So I just decided to let her enjoy prom with her sister.

I then asked him if I could sat at his table instead, and he said YES. He was fine with it! He could’ve told me that he would prefer if it was him and his gf at the table alone, but no, he never gave me any indication that it was a problem. I remember that he was happy I was there. We just chilled that night. 

His other points don’t make much sense either, him saying that he never got to be alone with her is bold considering that I didn’t enter or leave the venue with them. I didn’t even arrive until over an hour after prom started. I was late. Plus, towards the end i wasn’t with them, I was with some of my other friends who I ended up leaving it’s. Also, him saying that he barely has pictures without me in them kinda cancels out when he still DOES have pictures without me in them at the end of the day.

S/o states he will fix it. 

Part comes in, he replaces it, door still won’t lock. He gets angry and what does he do? Start repeatedly slamming the door of the machine over and over again in a rage fit. I have to shout “stop it! You’re going to break it again!” And he looks at me and yells “oh so this is my fault?!”

After he says he has to go to the store to buy new underwear because he has no clean ones left. WTF? So I grab all the dirty laundry in the house, and go to the 24hr laundry mat late on a Saturday night so everyone can have clean laundry and so he doesn’t have to keep buying new clothes because the ones he has are dirty.

I ask Sunday if he will call a service rep because he has the info for one to come and fix the machine. He says he will call Monday because those are business hours. Okay, totally understandable.

53,1egu401,WIBTA if I called out my friend for being posessive? ,"I 17f go to this high school with my other friends, the problematic friend(A)16f in my opinion is being way to possessive of my other friend(B)17f. I joined the school a little later than A and B so i have very few friends. A and B only met this year. A doesn't study as well as me and B do, so during exam time, while A is talking to her other friends, B and i find a quieter place to have a little study session. A took this personally because she doesn't like the fact that me and B are spending more time together, she made it up in her head that we don't include her when it comes to academics and completely iced us out for a while. During this time, me and B got closer together and because we learn and grow together during our study sessions, we continued studying together. Other common friends of me and B also come and join us, but A never came to join us because in her words""we wouldn't care about her anyway"". This is example 1. 

Another time on A's birthday since i was new to Instagram and social media, i didnt know posting pictures and stories for your friends birthdays was a major deal. Later at her birthday party, she hugged everyone goodbye but me. I didn't take out personally since me and A weren't too close anyway so i shrugged it off. On my birthday, now that I knew that posting stories was a big deal, expected that B wouldn't post a story for my birthday, and i was right because she did it out of spite and i didnt post on her birthday only because i was clueless. 

A and B had a lot of arguments in this year alone, and A only ever talks to us if she needs help with boy problems and although we consider eachother to be good friends, A only likes B and only wants B to be close to A. B got stuck of this possessiveness and decided to tell her firm and strictly that this behaviour wouldn't fly with her. A and B have since not been talking, and A has started to despise me more and more. Yesterday, as i entered the classroom, A pretended to be asleep, and i know she was pretending because we made eye contact and i guess she thought that i wouldn't have noticed her eyes open. She would rather pretend to be asleep than to talk to me and sort things out. 

The day before, she only spoke to me when i started the conversation and she was so uninterested the whole time but she only spoke tome when she  needed help before a math exam but yesterday, the only conversation we had was that split second of eye contact.
Should I call her out for breaking up this friendship group we had? Or should I just avoid talking to her until she talks to me?

Later at her birthday party, she hugged everyone goodbye but me. I didn't take out personally since me and A weren't too close anyway so i shrugged it off. On my birthday, now that I knew that posting stories was a big deal, expected that B wouldn't post a story for my birthday, and i was right because she did it out of spite and i didnt post on her birthday only because i was clueless. 

A and B had a lot of arguments in this year alone, and A only ever talks to us if she needs help with boy problems and although we consider eachother to be good friends, A only likes B and only wants B to be close to A. B got stuck of this possessiveness and decided to tell her firm and strictly that this behaviour wouldn't fly with her. A and B have since not been talking, and A has started to despise me more and more. Yesterday, as i entered the classroom, A pretended to be asleep, and i know she was pretending because we made eye contact and i guess she thought that i wouldn't have noticed her eyes open. She would rather pretend to be asleep than to talk to me and sort things out. 

The day before, she only spoke to me when i started the conversation and she was so uninterested the whole time but she only spoke tome when she  needed help before a math exam but yesterday, the only conversation we had was that split second of eye contact.
Should I call her out for breaking up this friendship group we had? Or should I just avoid talking to her until she talks to me? 

WIBTA if i call her out for being petty and possessive and that she had no control over who B chooses to be friends with, and that she is being unnecessarily problematic to hate me for no reason?

Ps. I will be deleting this post later on because i dont want anyone making YouTube shorts about this :)",1.0,1.0292233228683472,1,1

55,1egtpe0,AITA for my refusal to attend my sister's wedding?,"Older sister (41f) is getting married to her partner of 3ish years in a month. Older sister and her partner both have children. My sister has a 14 year old boy and 10 year old girl. Her partner has a 14 year old girl, 13 year old boy and 11 year old girl. The relationship is controversial.

My nephew (14) has been having trouble with the 14 year old girl since the third grade and this actually escalated when they were doing virtual classrooms. She would write a lot of insults about my nephew and used the voice feature to target my nephew. But still my sister and her partner started a romantic relationship and even moved in together. My nephew expressed a lot of unhappiness about this. So did his grandparents (bio father's parents, he's not involved but they were always very generous in helping my sister with my nephew). My sister stopped all contact with the paternal grandparents as a result of them speaking up.

When my sister and her partner got engaged my nephew didn't take it well. There was a public scene where he told everyone present that she was marrying his bullies dad and didn't give a shit about him. My sister was furious. Nephew was devastated that his mom was marrying her partner even knowing how he'd feel.

My sister didn't want to hear from anyone, including me, that it was a bad idea and she risked losing her son. She told me he didn't get to dictate her life and they'd deal with the bullying but he was being unreasonable about everything. I told her my nephew deserved space away from the girl and she told me he can't pick his family and siblings fight sometimes.

Two months ago my nephew ran away. He was gone for 2.5 weeks and we were searching everywhere. He'd wanted to go to his grandparents but worried they'd get into trouble. CPS intervened when he was found and my nephew was removed from my sister's home and was given a placement with his grandparents, which was his first choice. I talked to him since and he said he was glad he was removed. He said he had been prepared to keep running away and he told the social worker that and more. We're in touch frequently and I get to visit him. My sister could visit but my nephew doesn't want to see her. But she's proceeding with everything like normal. We fought over her picking the relationship over nephew. She told me I'll never understand.

My invite came in the middle of all this and I RSVP'd no. I made it clear I would not attend this wedding after everything that's happened. My sister and parents told me I should put aside the family troubles and attend or risk the relationship forever. I told them I stand by my nephew over my sister.

56,1egt5sb,AITA for using an ultimatum to get my girlfriend out of a depression spiral?,"All of last night and this morning my girlfriend has been in a terrible state of mind with lots of low self esteem, extreme negative thoughts, and just general self depreciation. When she gets I'm moods like this she wants to and tries to push everyone away from her. I generally just try to express my love for her and listen to what she has to say but today was especially bad. 

She is in the middle of finals week, and today is one of the only free days she has to study and write final essays and finish up homework before semester end. In light of this, I suggested that I would call out of work to drive down to be with her. She told me that calling out would be an aweful idea, asked me not to call out, and told me that she didn't want to feel guilty about me missing work. When she next told me she could manage on her own, I pointed out that she had not up to this point managed well on her own. At this point I was just about ready to message my manager to call out and drive down to be with her. I've done so in the past, and it almost always helps in the end.

The only compromise I could think of at the time was to give an ultimatum. I sent her this message ""I'm going to call out unless you can promise me that you're going to try to make an effort to feel better. That you'll get up and improve your mood even if it's something as little as making yourself a cup of tea"". 
When I sent it, she said she couldn't promise but she'd try and I said I'd take it.

After 5ish minuets of her thinking about it, she came back and told me that message was cruel and manipulative. That I was using her guilt over me calling out to enforce my rules on her and make her obey, making her shut up by using a ploy. 

Now I'm not quite sure how to feel. Was I an asshole for putting her in that ultimatum?

58,1egsk5h,AITA for telling my vet tech roommate she's a bad pet owner?,"I'm 32F and my roommate is 29F. She has a 3yo cat who has allergies, separation anxiety and needs A LOT of attention daily. A good cat, but if he gets bored or lonely he gets destructive.

Roommate has a busy lifestyle, works 10 hour days as a vet tech, spends about half the week at her boyfriends house and goes on out of town trips 3-4 times a year. This means she is not home routinely to give her cat his supplements, clean his litter, play with him, or just generally be present for him. I care for him when she's not home and he is so sweet when it's just us but I do have to carry him around the house a lot and play with him tons. I don't mind, I love cats, and he loves being carried, but I didn't sign up for two cats, and I need to prioritize my own pet.

I am posting this due to a dispute surrounding the cats wellbeing. He has had 3 trips since January to the vet for eating something upsets his stomach or backs up his bowels. All of these events happened while I was not home but she was. Last week he broke into his kibble storage and ate 4 days of food causing constipation. Despite clear signs that he was very unwell, she waited two days before bringing him into the vet. I asked her why and she told me ""I thought he was being lazy cause it's hot"". We had a heat wave, but we've been having much cooler weather the last two weeks, and we have A/C, so inside our house has never gotten hotter than 23C.

The fight started was when she told me a that she was going to her boyfriends but would keep an eye on her cat while she was gone. I asked her what she meant and she said she'd set up a pet camera a few days prior. I am not against pet cameras, but I am not okay with it in the house without me knowing. I got mad at her and told her she chose a high needs pet who needs more than she can offer and expects everyone else to deal with the things she can't be bothered to and it was her choice to get a high needs animal that didn't mesh with her lifestyle so it's her responsibility to manage. That it was an invasion of privacy to bring a camera into the house without informing me and her animal needing more care won't solved by a camera, she needs to be present for her pet. I told her her job doesn't instantly make her good with animals and most times that her pet has gotten sick could have been avoided if she just paid more attention to him. Prime example is he ate a lily plant one time while she had him outside on a walk on a 3ft leash. Spent a week fighting for his life in vet care.

I don't think I am the AH, but since this dispute she has been avoiding me and any time we do cross paths in the house she literally runs away immediately.

I'm out of town for a month visiting family, and she's better at shopping / bargaining than me (or so I thought), so she said she would get us something before I came back.



She called me last night and said she found us a ""great deal"" and had bought it. A used car with low mileage, everything running great, perfectly clean-looking, and good features for only $1800.



The catch? The car's been used for the past several years by this retiring ferret breeder, who's been using it to haul hundreds (if not thousands) of ferrets back and forth for years, which is why it was listed at such a low price. The guy even told her no one else had been willing to buy it.



When she said she went through with this sale, I got angry and asked how she could do that. She was surprised and said that she got us a great deal and that the car was perfectly clean and runs well.



Her excuse is 'there's no actually mess inside, no ferret urine stains, nothing, they always kept them in cages during transport, they say it's only the smell of the animals themselves, not the urine or waste or anything unclean."" But from what I've heard of ferrets that's somehow even worse.

60,1egsdkl,AITA for not inviting my chronically ill friend anymore?,"I (21F) have a friend and flatmate (20F, I’ll call her bee) who has been struggling with her health for a few years. This year, it has gotten worse and she dropped out of college and moved back in with her parents. Bee and I have been in the same large group of friends since high school, and a lot of us went to the same college, although Bee has drifted from a lot of them, and only really talks to me and one other person. Due to a few arguments last year (that neither Bee or I were involved in), the original friend-group groupchat was abandoned, and another was made without Bee in it. I honestly believe this was just due to Bee not being very close with the creator of the groupchat, and I didn’t want to just take it upon myself to add her in. Plans have been made in that group-chat ever since, so I would make the effort to invite Bee myself, as I genuinely like her company and didn’t want her feeling left out. 

Tension began to arise a few months ago when I showed Bee something on my phone and a notification from the groupchat came up. She went very quiet for a while and eventually confessed to feeling hurt that she wasn’t included. I apologised, and told her I didn’t really know why she hadn’t been added in by the others (truth), and that it doesn’t really matter as I invite her to things anyway. Bee then said that she feels embarrassed going to hang outs now since she knows that it has been planned in the groupchat and she is “just invited third party”. I didn’t really know what else to say so it was left at that. 

Summer rolled around, and Bee had started declining my offers to come along to thing panned in the groupchat, using her health as the excuse. We have hung out by ourselves a few times, but she hasn’t shown up to anything with the others despite me inviting her, so I stopped inviting her to the last few nights out, games nights etc as I assumed she didn’t want to go. Then, last month, it was planned in the groupchat that we would go camping for a few days, and I, again, didn’t invite Bee. She proceeded to ignore my messages for around 2 weeks until she eventually answered, saying that she feels hurt she hasn’t been invited, and she feels like she has lost all her friends since becoming sick. I explained that it wasn’t that at all, and the only reason I didn’t invite her is as she declined the last few invitations, as well as the fact she is a week out from surgery and probably wouldn’t do well with camping. She has not answered my messages since. Should I have invited her anyway even though she barley accepts anymore?

She proceeded to ignore my messages for around 2 weeks until she eventually answered, saying that she feels hurt she hasn’t been invited, and she feels like she has lost all her friends since becoming sick. I explained that it wasn’t that at all, and the only reason I didn’t invite her is as she declined the last few invitations, as well as the fact she is a week out from surgery and probably wouldn’t do well with camping. She has not answered my messages since. Should I have invited her anyway even though she barley accepts anymore?

61,1egrzng,AITA my friend always wants to know who is all coming to my parties and I don’t answer her cause it’s annoying  ,"Background: we’ve been very close  friends for over 10 years, she knows or has met mostly everyone in my life (extended family, husbands friends, even some coworkers). There is no drama (so it’s not a “i need to know if this person who makes me really uncomfortable is coming so I can decide how to proceed  “ situation). 

I throw this annual party every year and it’s huge. Like over 30 people invited. She always asks me “who all is coming” and I never list out the guest list cause 1. Why?  and 2. I don’t even know lol. So I kinda gave her a snippy idk it’s too big of a list. 

Am I the asshole? Is her request reasonable? Unless it’s a small intimate gathering and I’m curious I never ask who is all coming, I think  it’s kind of rude. Like yes you know most people in my life but also it’s my and my husbands thing why do you always need to know everything ?  

Note: I don’t really care in that I’m not gonna argue with her or make it a thing I’m just genuinely curious if this is normal or not ?

62,1egrq95,AITA for making my mom sad by telling her I (28) smoke weed?,"Okay I'm feeling very guilty. I'm a heavy smoker (cigarretes) any ways (she knows it and is a smoker herself) and one day she saw the rest of a joint and asked me about it. I told I was smoking some herbs to try and quit smoking nicotine, but I knew she suspected it (we smoked together before once to try and laugh or asses off, if you can believe that - she had a bad experience with it). Right know I'm depressed, my dad has been discovered ricently to have a very agressive cancer, and then I had a shoulder lesion that made me quit my job because they denied switching me to other roles).

That's when depression started and after a week only staying in bed I decided to get weed again to help me with depression (it doesn't cure it, but makes the symptom very more mild). I did it once last year when I had another depression episode - my business went bankrupt. I don't smoke weed often. I also have panic disorder and was then also having panic attacks daily, more than one time by the day, and I now have them very sparse and way less agressive.

I have a therapist and a psychologist schedule. However in the meantime weed's been also having something strange this time, it's bringing memories and traumas and things I didn't even know were hurting me. I know some people who also have this. I cried a sometimes when  they surface, and today, for the first time I was able to cry out about my dad's cancer - while high. I wanted to be honest with my mom and also tell her about how it's been helping me figure out things and get things out while I wait for my appointments.

I tried talking to her very calmly, but she keeps saying I'll be smoking stronger stuff in the future even with me telling her I have and am using only during depression and citing the benefits it's been having on me. She cried. Then she told me she wanted to sleep and went to bed, out of the blue. I wish I hadn't tell her, she's already dealing with a lot with my dad's cancer and taking care of him (I also take care of him). And know I'm sad and worried that she'll be even sadder and worried about me doing hard drugs anytime soon.

63,1egr5m8,"AITA for “snitching” on my bf’s best friend, and is he reacting abusively? ","I (25F) work in a kitchen and had a meeting today along with other staff with our area manager to discuss general concerns. Our pub manager has a reputation of being bad at his job for various reasons and staff are extremely unhappy with it. My boyfriend (26M) worked there as a manager (he’s recently transferred) and considers the pub manager as his best friend. 

When I found out about the meeting I spoke to my bf about it and told him that I planned on being honest - at first he said I shouldn’t because I’m planning to transfer soon but then he said to do what I want as long as I keep his name out of it. The area manager asked people to stay behind if they wished to speak to him privately so I did, and I raised a concern that’s been bothering me a lot. Long story short the poor food hygiene conditions led me and another coworker to have severe food poisoning, both bedridden for almost a week. 
I first spoke to the pub manager about this and he assured me that he was taking this seriously and would talk to the management team and investigate. Two weeks passed and I found out that he hadn’t said a word to a single manager about my concerns which included raw meat being re-labelled when it should be thrown away. So I privately mentioned this to the area manager as I felt I had given the pub manager enough opportunity to deal with it himself.  

After the meeting I called my bf and gave him the run down of what was said. He kicked off at me, calling me a grass (snitch) and saying that’s his best friend and I should respect that.

Context: the pub manager has never been a true friend to my bf and it’s well known that he fucks him over and talks bad about him behind his back, however my bf refuses to say a bad word about him. It’s caused arguments with us in the past as I have pushed him to stand up for himself but he refuses and makes excuses for him.  

Anyway, I ended the call and he continued the argument over text - he gets very angry when I ignore him so I kept replying, even though I was angry, which I know was wrong. I said some cruel things such as saying that he just lays down rolls over and let’s this guy ass fuck him and its pathetic etc. This was after he had been really nasty to me but again I knew better and should’ve not replied. He replied by calling me a “little bitch” and said “I don’t give a shit what you think, I said don’t say anything so you don’t say anything, next time do as I say.” And when I mentioned that this guy isn’t loyal to him yet I am, he said “I don’t care it doesn’t matter” because I didn’t do what he told me to do and “keep my mouth shut.”  Now this has worried me because we’re supposed to be moving in together soon and I’m wondering if this is a sign that he is becoming more controlling and potentially abusive. 

So my question is, AITA for snitching on his friend, and is he the AH for reacting the way he did?

64,1egqupa,AITA for requesting my sister leave her toddler home for a girl’s trip?,"ETA: We have previously talked as a family about this (before any of the babies in question) and made a rule that babies could come but only if they are breastfeeding because the trip is “meant to be a break from your kids”. (Quoting my mom.) I have obeyed that rule and left my kids when they are not feeding from me.  

Background: Each year the women in my family do a girl’s trip where we each take turns choosing the place. Year 1 my sister brought her 8 year old. Year 2 she brought her 9 year old and 7 year old. Year 3 no kids and it was amazing.

Year 4 is my turn to choose. She said she is bringing her 18 month old. Didn’t even ask me if it would be ok. Said she “has to” bc her husband has work. I asked the husband if we needed to change dates. He said he can watch the kids and there’s no need to change the dates. My sister still plans to bring him because I will be bringing my 4 month old (breastfeeding) and “what’s the difference?” I told her one can walk and talk and one can’t

She has a history of feeling like no one helps or supports her, but I also feel like it’s a really big expectation to expect us all to spend our vacation time and money to help babysit her toddler she could leave at home. I also just wish she would at least be honest and respectful about it. Saying like “hey I’m anxious about leaving the toddler, is it ok if I bring him? I’ll make sure he doesn’t kill the vibe.” Instead of just bringing him and acting like she has no choice 

(P.S. Last year was technically my real year to choose but we cancelled it because after putting a (refundable) deposit down on the airbnb she got tickets to see Ed Sheeran and wanted to do that instead lmao)

66,1egqe64,AITA for Overreacting over a Meal because I’m a Vegetarian  ,"Hi, I really want to know if I'm in the wrong here... also I am new to Reddit so I apologize if I say things weirdly. So me(F19) and my three siblings: Jade (F25), John (M28) and Jay (M18) went out to a restaurant. For context I chose to be a vegetarian because I've loved animals since I was kid, however I don't like to force people to not eat meat around me because it's a personal choice. All my siblings think it's dumb (Jay is more understanding though) but usually it doesn't cause problems since restaurants always a vegetarian option- usually they try to respect it. 
I was at the hospital visiting a friend before we went to the restaurant and told my siblings to order without me. The place was a local Asian restaurant, my siblings only had money for one course (usually you share so it doesn't matter). I assumed they would be understanding and order something we all could eat at least- but nope. When I got back from the hospital I realized they brought chicken dumplings... which I couldn't eat. 
Now here is where I might've overreacted, I asked them why they didn't get me something I could actually eat but they said the vegetarian thing is dumb and selfish and they wanted chicken dumplings so that's what they got. Feeling disrespected, I got angry- and when I do i unfortunately cry- which they felt like I was being a baby about a small plate of food. John and Jade felt like I was ungrateful since they paid for it as the oldest siblings. 
To make matters worse John also started making jokes like I was the type to hold out vegan signs and cry whenever someone took a bite of meat. I told him to stop repeatedly because I was upset and after ten attempts I audibly yelled at him to 'shut up' and left. Jay felt like I was being overlooked and doesn't think I'm TA. I just feel like I'm not being taken seriously but they only see it as being selfish. 

Edit: I should have clarified but Jade is the one that invited us to visit. Jade and John both have jobs and usually pay. Me and jay are broke college students. If I knew they wouldn't consider my choices I wouldn't have gone. 

Edit 2: I was feeling emotional so I didn't clarify some things whilst writing it. The reason I didnt pay is because my older siblings have always paid since they have jobs- if not our parents. Its just the way our family works. The chicken dumplings were decided between Jade and John (Jay is scared of being involved in sibling drama so he said nothing). When I said 'order without me' they knew I meant to order everyones things- which is why they left me my share of dumplings- since they know i dont have enough money and didnt want them to wait up for me. For the people who think its weird for 4 people to get a family share of dumplings... valid... this is a geniune meal for us lmao. I do welcome all sides of arguments which is why I posted this on reddit. Thank you for your comments! :)

67,1egq0tz,AITAH for not giving my sister who eloped as generous as a gift as my sister who had a traditional wedding?,"My parents had me when they were really young, are still together now and had two more kids, my sisters Katie and Jess later on. Im 15 and 17 years older than them respectively. Because of the age gap, we didn't really grow up together and sometimes I feel more like an uncle than a big brother to them. Ive been fortunate in my career to do relatively well and Ive typically been pretty generous with them when it comes to things like Birthday's, Christmas, and graduations.

My sister Katie got married 2 summers ago and had your typical traditional wedding. Id guess around 125 people were there, it was very nice, and definitely not cheap. I dont know how much they spent but I know my parents and her husbands only were able to contribute for about half the cost. The rest was my sister and her husband paying for it. They were super cool and let me and my wife bring our 2 kids even though I later found out the venue charged the same for kids as adults for the food and everything. It meant a lot and I didnt want their inclusion to be a burden so my wife and I gifted them $500 as a wedding present to cover our plates plus a little extra.

My sister Jess has always been more ""low key"". When she got engaged she told us all she would likely elope and nobody tried to convince her otherwise because it made sense for them. They arent flashy and have always seemed pretty frugal, definitely not the type to throw a big wedding costing 10s of thousands. They announced a couple weeks ago that they eloped in the mountains with just them and the necessary witness. I was happy for them and didnt feel like I missed out on anything, Ive been to enough weddings that I dont have fomo, Im just happy they had what felt right for them.

Since they didnt have a wedding, I didnt think to get them a wedding present because you know no wedding...but they did just go under contract on their first home together so my wife and I got them a $100 gift card to Home Depot. I remember when I first bought my first home there were a lot of home improvement stuff and I made about 100 trips there so thought it would be a nice gift.

Apparently she asked Katie what they got for their wedding and she told them and now felt a certain way about our gift to them. She made a comment about feeling like their marriage wasnt respected enough because they didnt throw a big party and said it felt like I was showing favoritism. I told her I have Katie more because she hosted my whole family and I know how expensive that is having paid for my own wedding. Jess kinda rolled her eyes and walked away after that interaction and we havent talked about it since. That was this past Sunday.

 I thought it would be understood that the situations were just different and its unreasonable to expect the same generosity when you don't give any generosity (aka hosting and feeding people) by not having a traditional wedding and not inviting us to celebrate with them.

She believes that if I want the room that I should pay more, but are my contributions not enough to compensate the difference? AITA in this situation?!

Me and someone who I will not name out of respect were supposed to go to a concert together. We haven't been able to do shit in the longest time so it was just supposed to be me and her. A few days ago she hits me up and she says that she wants her boyfriend to come. Now to make my point, I've met this man 2 times. Idk him. But from what she's told me he's not a good guy and he reminds me of an ex, I'm talking massive PTSD trigger for me. But because I still wanted to go with her I said sure AS LONG AS I can also have someone ride with for my comfort. I'm not willing to 3rd wheel you guys especially when he already makes me uncomfortable. 

This girl tells me that she has to ask her man for PERMISSION for me to bring someone because he dosnt want her around other men?!?!?!?!?!?!? This was my response and I was livid

""First of all your man was never apart of this plan to begin with. Second of all I wasn't asking you if I could bring someone I was TELLING you I'm bringing someone.

70,1egog3f,AITA for going on vacation?,"My (25F) best friend (24F) is from the Middle East and is getting engaged soon. Typically, her culture involves both sets of parents meeting to set the date for the engagement, which then happens in front of both families on the agreed date. We've been friends for 20 years, and she really wants me to be there.
Here's the situation: my in-laws invited me to join a family trip from August 1-11. Although the date was set, I hadn't booked my tickets yet because my friend said her engagement would likely be on August 10, though it wasn't confirmed. Every time we talked, the date seemed to change-from August 10 to July 28, and then to August
15. I kept waiting for a confirmation, but by the beginning of July, my in-laws asked if I was still coming and if I'd booked my flight. Feeling pressured as tickets were getting more expensive, I booked flexible tickets from August 1-11. This way, my in-laws could plan around me, and I could return early if her engagement was on the 10th.
Now, my friend is really mad and says I'm putting in no effort to be there. explained my thought process, but she said that if I truly wanted to be there, I would have asked for a confirmation. I admitted that I should have asked for more details, but in my mind, I had already tried to accommodate her by booking flexible tickets.
I reached out to ask her how the meeting with her parents went, hoping to ease the tension, but her response was cold, indicating she was still upset.

71,1ego6ru,AITA for telling my mom's husband him acting as father of the bride is too big a role?,"My mom was a single mom by choice with me. She used a (known) donor. He has donated to my mom so she could have me (25f) and to his brother and SIL so they could have kids with the brother's DNA still in play in some way. I know of them but don't know them. My sperm donor is not my dad, or my father. He's my biological father sure. But he doesn't really play any role in my life. It was just my mom and me, and my aunts and uncles and cousins.

I was 14 when my mom *met* her her husband, 16 when he moved in with us and 18 when they got married. I never saw him as a parental figure, a father figure, my dad, my second parent, etc. He was my mom's partner/husband. He was a part of the family now. But I only have 1 parent and she's an amazing one. I never felt like I missed out on having a dad or two parents. I never needed a second person to come in and parent me. My mom also never felt like she needed another parent for me, or a co-parent. Even when Rick moved in with us she still acted as my sole parent and he was introduced as her partner and nothing more. I had to treat him with respect, show him the same consideration I would show any family member, but she never asked me to call him dad or let him fill some role of dad.

Rick and I have an okay relationship. I'm not super close to him. We get along fine, we can talk easily and there was only one time any tension existed between us before. It was when I turned 20 and he called and asked if there was any fatherly stuff I ever felt I needed and would I let him do it. When I said no he told me he had hoped for a different answer and I told him I never longed for a father or felt like I was missing one. We had to talk it out. He did (seemingly) accept that I wasn't interested. Now I'm not so sure.

He was present when mom and I were looking through wedding invite samples. She was helping me narrow it down for me and my fiancé to decide between. We had some samples written up with our wording of choice. Rick asked why his name wasn't on the invites. My mom told him it's because my fiancé and I are listing the parents, not the parents spouses, my fiancé has divorced parents who only very recently remarried. It was after this day Rick reached out to me and he told me he had expected he would be father of the bride and he told me he wanted to be. I told him we could find him something but not father of the bride. Rick offered to fill a more traditional father of the bride role and pay for the wedding. I told him he didn't need to do that. He said he wanted to and father of the bride is a big deal. I said it is and it's too big a role for him because he was never a parent to me. He grumped that he was never anyone's father and then he told me saying it was too big for him was hurtful and insensitive when he offered.

72,1ego0kx,AITA for not bringing my BF to my mother's funeral?,"My BF \[26M\] and I \[33M\] have pretty different social lives. He is in the closet for almost all his circle but his mom and two girl-friends, whereas all my circle and family knows I'm bi and knows about him (I have pictures of us in our social media, so...).

My family met him two years ago when he moved in with me (we have been dating for 4 years now) and I met his mom two months ago. My family is mostly homophobic, but they are the most polite people in the world, so when I introduce them to my bf they were nice to him and even invited him to a family dinner a year ago, but on the side, they told me never bring him back to their house again, they weren't pleased by me doing it (when they met my ex-gf of 7 years, they were lovely around her and even after we broke up, they kept a good relationship with her honestly, but with bf was not the same and I kinda knew that would happen). My bf knows this and got hurt when I told him what happened.

Fast forward, my mom got heavily sick due COVID after-effects, and according to doctor's she has just a few weeks at best. We, as a family, are already living our grief and we are ok with the situation.

The issue came yesterday, we were talking with my bf what will happen when my mom dies and I told him I would have to drive all night to get to the funeral since it will be at my mom's birth town. He asked me if he should be preparing clothes in advance for the trip and I said ""amor, you are not coming to the funeral, my family wouldn't be ok with us being there as a couple."" He got mad and told me that, as my boyfriend, he should be there supporting me and that if things were different, he would be bringing me over with him.

I told him that for his family and friends, we are just roomies and friends, and we act like that in front of them (he asked me to do that until he comes out the closet), while all my family and relatives knows about him, so the scenarios are different.

He got really upset and is giving me the cold shoulder since yesterday. I'm definitely not bringing him over, but I don't know if I'm the asshole in this situation.

  
ETA: Just to clarify something, I asked my mom and dad in advance if it would be ok for them if I bring my bf to the funeral since it will be at my mom's family place, and both said no.

74,1egnu8o,AITA for telling my ex’s grandmother he broke my trust,"Context: My ex(trans male 19) and I(cis male 22) had been dating for 4 and a half years. Through our relationship we have had many wonderful memories together and I fully loved him, he said the same to me.

Our relationship started a couple weeks before Covid lockdown, after the lockdown we would meet in his driveway and talk for hours almost everyday. I would ride my bike to his house at night and sneak in to have sex, this was frequent but his sex drive was quite low and most of the time we would end up just cuddling. It was a blissful time.

The issues started in about the second year, I can’t remember which happened first but both of us gave head to someone else. Me to my best friend, also male, and this caused a lot of drama. After the deed, I broke down and called my ex and confessed and he forgave me. He was with a couple high school friends and I at a fair, he went on the Farris wheel with one person(also male if that matters) in particular and gave them head. I had made it clear I wasn’t comfortable with it beforehand but still forgave him. During high school as well, he would regularly throw birthday and holiday parties and several times spin the bottle was played, always recommended by my ex. 

Later on I went into my ex’s room and there was a girl there(let’s name her Christy) my ex asked me if Christy could join the relationship, I was put on the spot but found her attractive so I accepted. It was a super fun experience and I felt extremely confident and happy until I noticed more and more about Christy that I wasn’t happy with. Eventually I told Christy I wasn’t attracted to her anymore, I told her that she could still have a relationship with my ex but I didn’t want to see her anymore. This led to Christy completely ghosting the both of us. This was one of the last high school friends to leave my ex. During our relationship his friend group was quite large but several members were quite flaky, after a couple years there were only about two people who were still friends with him. 

College started for my ex, he went to one about 2 and a half hours away. Over the course of the first semester, he had very few people to call friends. I would visit twice a month, eventually reducing to once a month because of how much driving and how tired it was making me. We discussed opening the relationship so he could find relations while lonely in his single dorm. I set restrictions and they were pushed down to very lax restrictions. Condoms, no anal, no toys, no nudes. In the first week he saw 3 or 4 different men. I trusted him and he was open and honest about it. But damn did this hurt. He found one person to form a FWB thing with and that continued for a couple months. Over winter break, my heart felt healed, he was mine again, and we fucked like rabbits. And then he was back at school, he had forgotten some stuff at home and I drove up on a weekday to drop it off and head back the same day. On the way back I fell asleep on the highway and totaled my car, eventually getting another later that month.

He was back at school and back to his freedom, several more hookups occurred before the end of the school year but it doesn’t matter. He came home for the summer(we had exclusivity rules for breaks) and we had a lot of fun. Then we went back to his college over one weekend to go to a wedding for someone he knew, and I had his phone because what he wore didn’t have pockets. I found nudes he sent and people I didn’t know about. I confronted him after the wedding and he promised he wouldn’t do it again. I gave him another chance. A couple weeks later one night he was quite drunk at my place and I checked his phone again, with quite a bit more scrutiny. And found that he had been with someone without a condom and that he was sending nude and still sexting while we were supposed to be exclusive. I confronted him the next morning and he honestly told me everything. He said he would end it and I forgave him again. He went on a trip back to near where his college was to help the bride of the previously mentioned wedding move into their new house. 


We have each others locations on so I saw he went to a different house and spent the night, I confronted him and he was quite hesitant to say that yes he had a hookup while there. I ended things, we left on good terms and I wanted him back when he “outgrows” this phase. I went to his house the day after he got back(my car had broken down in his driveway a couple weeks before). The hookup was there, quite uncomfortable. After a week I finally went over and waited for a tow truck to bring my car home to avoid the awkwardness. He was on a different date and not home at the time but his grandmother(the only parental figure) was there. We were talking as I waited and told her that my ex had broken my trust and I couldn’t deal with it anymore. His grandmother told me she was surprised I stuck around so long. After he got back from his date grandmother told him what I said. Now my ex, who I still want to be on good terms with, is refusing to talk to me. I didn’t expose him for anything, I specifically navigated around discussing why I had lost trust. So Reddit, am I the asshole?

During this time, I asked Bella to call me as I needed her support and she went out drinking and only called to tell me she was going to stay out late. The next day she mentioned wanting to go out drinking again, so I sent her some money so she could and asked her not to stay out too late. She stayed out until 9 AM, and later admitted she had cheated on me. She told me on my 36th hour into “The Great Corridor Wait” 

Bella suggested we switch to an open relationship, which I agreed to, hoping it would help rebuild trust. We set some boundaries, though Bella hoped they would loosen over time. I found out I had Glandular Fever and would be on the ward for longer. Bella went out frequently, and I asked her to inform me of her plans to ensure she was safe. She felt this was controlling and asked if I would hold the cheating against her forever. 

We agreed she would communicate her plans better. For a few days, things improved; she messaged more and was open about her activities. I became more comfortable with the open relationship, though I bottled up some discomfort to avoid being seen as controlling.

Whilst still in a&e I asked Bella if she’d watch a film with me and she said she was too tired. She then later went out to help a friend pack for a holiday. She apologised when I said that had upset me but felt I was being controlling again.

A day after my discharge they arranged the first hookup. The communication was all good and I was even excited for them. But some of the elements of it made me uncomfortable and I didn't feel I could reach out about it to them (which is entirely my fault) 

Well the day after that hookup (yesterday) I did reach out about my concerns and how I felt I couldn't talk about my boundaries without being accused of controlling them. This led to an argument and they broke up with me because the long-distance relationship was too hard. She ended things two days before my birthday, on national friendship day and went out drinking, I suspect hooking up with someone else last night. 

I’m left questioning if I was unfair or controlling. 
The boundaries I asked for were that they didn’t sleep with their close friends.

Also, their only communication is through Snapchat, where he love-bombs her with compliments. She keeps asking for phone- and FaceTime-calls, but again “he is too busy with work”
He says he would be disappointed, if she was to see anyone else, not that she wants to, but he goes out almost every weekend and spends time with his friends, which includes 2 girls. These girls always sleep over after their evenings out, and his explanation is “because his apartment is just closer to the bars, so it is safer for them to sleep over”. 
The problem is, I, or her other friends, simply do not believe him and his interest for her. If he wanted to spend time with her, he would find time, or at least make an effort, and I have told my friend MULTIPLE times, she is delusional for believing in him, but she insists “he is the one”.

77,1egn3ub,WIBTA if I refused to pay my friend money?,"So I (27F) have this friend, Melissa (28F, not her real name).

Melissa had a rough childhood. She spent most of it in an orphanage-like type of place. She made bad choices in life, such as running away, dropping out of school and having 2 kids she can't afford (they both live with their dad now, who she has since broken up with. They seem well cared for)

We used to be best friends in primary school until we moved away. She was considered family and my parents were planning to adopt her, but her biologocal brother said no. Plus, she doesn't even live with him or speak to him. But that's another story.

Fast forward, she's now poor af and lives in some shithole. Last time I heard, she was living with a new boyfriend who gets paid, but needs to take care of a whole lot of people with a mediocre salary.

I've been sending her money once a month. Now, I quit my job because I'm emigrating and found a new one someplace else. I start September 1st, if all my paperwork gets done in time. I already told her that I can't help out anymore until then. She seemed very understanding.


She's got this nasty habit of calling me at the worst possible times to ask for money. She doesn't own a cellphone so she calls me on other people's phones (when she can) when she needs money, and she expects me to pay the moment she calls because I can send the money to the cellphone number for her to withdraw at an ATM. She also doesn't have a bank account.

I don't know how to magically grow some balls to tell her no. That's my problem. I'm a little spineless and I can't say no, and I'm afraid that she's taking advantage of this fact. She tells me she doesn't have food, and it guilts me into sending money every time. I can't say no because I don't want her to be hungry. What if she really doesn't have food?

I got a large bonus with my last salary now so I technically could send her money, but I don't want to. I need the cash for visas and plane tickets and living expenses once I'm there. And other stuff. Plus, I've been financially supporting my parents as well and I'm moving back in with them for a short while until I leave the country, so I need to still help out of course.

78,1egn2v1,AITA for texting my wife's boss to not ask her to dinner?,"I found a long string of texts on my wife's phone between her and her boss. Please understand, we have an open phone culture in our house - we don't keep secrets from each other, so she is in my phone all the time - no problem. 

Anyway, I happened to see her texting and when I went up to her, she quickly swiped away and closed her phone. This was suspicious of her because we are never secretive with each other.

A few days later, my curiosity peaked and I decided to browse her phone a bit to see if there was anything that would cause her to act like that.
I found a string of texts between her and her boss. They were recent texts and just personal happenings in our lives. As I read them (there were so many!) I happened upon one where she sent him a text saying that she is declining his offer to go out to dinner.
At that time, I was across the country in another state for a week with my daughter. He knew I was away when he offered.

To me, he had crossed a boundary. I don't care if his intentions were nobel or not, I felt that he was taking advantage of our situation to have alone time with my wife. Outside of work.

I expressed my concern with my wife and she spiraled into a massive litany about ""trust"".
Instead of having an open conversation about why it concerned me.

There was something more than meets the eye going on here (her texts were really long to him, very personal as to our family life, like he now has pictures of the inside of my house, pics of me, and many pics of her walking alone on paths or beaches.)
I told her that I was uncomfortable with all the attention she is giving him, when at the same time, she constantly complained about my shortcomings. She really esteemed her boss. He was so awesome.
Maybe I was just being jealous?
But, seriously she was really into him!
So after more fighting, one night I recovered her deleted texts, and screenshot her text about not having dinner with him.

I texted him telling him that he had crosses a boundary by asking my wife out to dinner while I was out of state. I told him that he was unprofessional to do such a thing - regardless of his intentions. 

He called me and we spoke - he was really defensive talking about being in the ""hospitality"" industry while they both actually work as finance people.

He never called me a asshole for a false accusation, nor said sorry.

79,1egmqkr,AITA for getting an irresponsible pet owner thrown out,"Pretty much what the title says, although of course I'll fill in the details. This happened a few days ago and I'm still thinking about it. I definitely didn't think I was the AH then, and I still don't now, but I'm becoming less certain the more I think about it.

Although we don't have any pets ourselves, my family was staying in a pet-friendly hotel. One morning I and my (5F) daughter were getting out of the elevator. Right there was a loose dog, no leash and no owner in sight. I don't recall the exact breed, but it was some sort of large terrier, probably a mutt. This dog immediately jumped on my daughter. It wasn't attacking, more overly enthusiastic friendliness, but it pinned her against the wall and she was freaking out.

I happened to be holding one of her dolls and used that to try to bait it away. The dog immediately latched on, so I didn't pull because I didn't want to damage the doll any further. At this point the dog's owner (or someone like that anyway, I'll get to that in a second) appeared and pulled the dog away. As I ushered my daughter away I shouted that he needs to control his dog better, to which he claimed it's not his dog.

Well I reported the incident to the hotel manager. When my whole family left a little bit later, we passed by the hotel manager confronting that same guy, who was holding that same dog. She (the hotel manager) broke off to go talk to us more, and she mentioned that he was getting removed from the hotel.

On the one hand, I feel bad about any punishment going to a completely innocent doggo. After all, he was just being friendly.

On the other hand, friendly or not, the owner was not in control and my daughter was pinned to a wall! Really, getting removed from the hotel is pretty minor punishment; if it had attacked I'd be pressing charges.

Plus, this is a proactive safety measure for the hotel. That dog wasn't attacking people, but if I had a dog with me, there would have been a fight.

I (20M) have been with this girl (20F) for 4 months now. For context, I am originally from a very conservative cultural family in the Middle East but have been attending college in the US for a year and my gf is from France with no relation to my culture.


My family is not strict in a religious sense, but are traditional in the way that they expect me to marry someone they approve of (family friend, same cultural background, etc). They have said this is about maintaining social/cultural ties, and I don’t think they would accept my gf tbh.


She has recently been talking about meeting my family, but more so in a jokingly kinda way if that makes sense. She doesn’t know much about my family and these norms which adds to my stress so I’ve been avoiding this topic altogether.


Additionally, my family has also been bringing up that I should meet someone and that if I don’t soon they’ll get serious about setting me up. To clarify, they are allowing me to choose so arranged marriage isn’t their first choice.

82,1eglrpc,AITA for ignoring my mother?,"(throwaway because I dont want people to know my life story from my profile) 

Context, I (18m) live with my mother (40F), stepfather(40M) and two younger siblings (2 and 10). My younger siblings do not share the same father as me, my father is a troubled man who found solitude in drugs and crime rather than raising a family. 

  
I am confident that this has shaped me as a person, I have a very healthy outlook on the situation and to be honest I wouldn't want it any other way. I know that I will be a great husband and father down the line, and I have an amazing girlfriend who is always reminding me that I am never going to be my father.

  
Anyway apologies for the tangent, My mother had a rough relationship with her mother, in a very similar scenario to that of my own with my father. My grandmother and my father actually found great solitude in eachother when they would talk because they knew that they understood eachothers way of thinking.

  
My mother's upbringing greatly impacted her, and she assumes that this means I will be the exact same way. I am not that way, I am very much so a ""get on with it"" type of person (likely because I am irish) but I am very aware of my emotions, and where they are coming from, so I am very lucky in the sense that I have always had emotional maturity.

  
My mother has been trying to force me into therapy my whole life, I did CBT for a year and found absolutely zero benefit (I am not saying it doesn't work, it just doesn't work for me) so instead of letting it go, she decided I need more ""intense"" therapy. I ended up trying one session for her and I got extremely emotional and relived things I just don't think I have to relive. 

  
We got home and after a few days I decided to tell her that I will not be taking part in this any longer, and that my experience is my own. I told her that every time I start doing good in life she tries to tell me I am depressed, and that I am at the best stage of my life. 

  
Her response will stick with me for the rest of my life,

""You'll have to go live with your da then""

This obviously struck me in my core, because; 

A) She knows that isn't possible, so I don't know why she would say that.

B) She knows what it's like, and she still said it.

I calmly told her, ""That is the most hurtful thing you have ever said to me"" and went to my room.

It has gotten to a stage where when my family return home I feel sick because I feel so unwanted and disrespected in my own home. I left school very early and made a career for myself (yes I plan to move soon) and they genuinely talk to me as if I am completely incompetent, and I will be honest it really bothers me.

They leave me to care for my 2 year old brother and have done since he was born, but will then say that I can't be left alone in the house (which they do everytime they need me to watch my younger brother(s))",Not the A-hole,2024-07-31,"AITA for ignoring my mother?

Anyway apologies for the tangent, My mother had a rough relationship with her mother, in a very similar scenario to that of my own with my father. My grandmother and my father actually found great solitude in eachother when they would talk because they knew that they understood eachothers way of thinking.

  
My mother's upbringing greatly impacted her, and she assumes that this means I will be the exact same way. I am not that way, I am very much so a ""get on with it"" type of person (likely because I am irish) but I am very aware of my emotions, and where they are coming from, so I am very lucky in the sense that I have always had emotional maturity.

  
My mother has been trying to force me into therapy my whole life, I did CBT for a year and found absolutely zero benefit (I am not saying it doesn't work, it just doesn't work for me) so instead of letting it go, she decided I need more ""intense"" therapy. I ended up trying one session for her and I got extremely emotional and relived things I just don't think I have to relive. 

  
We got home and after a few days I decided to tell her that I will not be taking part in this any longer, and that my experience is my own. I told her that every time I start doing good in life she tries to tell me I am depressed, and that I am at the best stage of my life. 

  
Her response will stick with me for the rest of my life,

""You'll have to go live with your da then""

This obviously struck me in my core, because; 

A) She knows that isn't possible, so I don't know why she would say that.

B) She knows what it's like, and she still said it.

I calmly told her, ""That is the most hurtful thing you have ever said to me"" and went to my room.

It has gotten to a stage where when my family return home I feel sick because I feel so unwanted and disrespected in my own home. I left school very early and made a career for myself (yes I plan to move soon) and they genuinely talk to me as if I am completely incompetent, and I will be honest it really bothers me.

They leave me to care for my 2 year old brother and have done since he was born, but will then say that I can't be left alone in the house (which they do everytime they need me to watch my younger brother(s))",0.0,0.0072086285799741745,0,1
83,1egle6r,"AITA for not inviting ""family"" to my child's birthday even they showed no interest in mine or her life ever.","I have an aunt and uncle who for years have not shown any interest in my life. We were close I helped out a lot with anything they asked, whether it was doing things for them or helping with my cousins (I am the eldest and have a large age gap meaning I could do babysitting). In the last 5 years I would say I have become nothing to them. They would never acknowledge me, never say hello, only some of them come to events I invited them to. My cousins who I was so close with basically stopped talking to me (that could be teenager things for the eldest though) but it was just one day nothing. In those 5 years I have meet my husband, he helped my aunt with a business adventure she tried to purse a couple of times but when he couldn't help one time it was a big deal, I told him not to cause that would happen but he was trying to be nice and help my family. We got engaged we never received a direct congratulations, they came to our wedding, we fell pregnant nothing.

85,1egl86y,AITA for telling my dad and stepmom they never should have put the inclusion of my siblings by my maternal family on me?,"My mom died when I (17f) was 4 and my dad remarried when I was 7. I also met my stepmom when I was 7. I went from spending every day at someone in my maternal family's house to staying home with my stepmom. I missed my maternal family. My grandparents had me most days but I also spent time between an aunt and an uncle who lived close by to us too and each would take turns having me as well. I missed not seeing them every day. Then there was some tension between my dad, stepmom and my maternal family. It was over my dad wanting me to call my stepmom 'mom' and wanting her to adopt me. He wanted my maternal family to get on board and encourage me to accept that. I was never adopted. Then when my stepmom had my half brother a year later the tension ran deeper because they didn't treat my half brother like a grandchild. To be honest they didn't even meet him. He wasn't a part of their family and I knew that.

My dad and stepmom expected that. When it was clear my maternal family weren't going to include my younger half siblings they wanted me not to see them at all. I cried when my dad told me so they changed their mind. But for years they would tell me how much my half siblings feelings would be hurt that my family wouldn't accept them. They asked me if I really loved my half siblings, if I really hated them, and then asked why I wouldn't insist we're all the same and if I'm loved they should be too. It was a lot. For a while my half siblings would cry when I'd go to see my family and not take them with me.

My stepmom told me it upset her that I wasn't the big sister who would make sure we were all treated the same. She also told me love shouldn't be conditional on blood and that I don't love her any less for being my non-biological mom. I told her I didn't love her like my mom. That I felt differently about her. She got mad and told me she was the only mom I knew and how it hurt her feelings and made her want to give up if she was always going to be stepmom. Talking directly to her I use her name, when talking about her I say stepmom, never mom.

The oldest two of my half siblings understand now why I have family they don't. The younger ones still cry and get upset when I see them and they can't come. My dad and stepmom still tell me how I should put my siblings feelings first. I told them the last time they said it that they never should have put that on me, a kid, and they should never have attempted to make that come between me and my family. My dad told me I need to understand where they're coming from and they had six kids total to think about, not just one while the other five were told to go fuck off. He told me I should have been a better sister to them. My stepmom said I should respect them more as parents.

89,1egki25,AITAH for making a snarky comment after my boundaries were overlooked?,"Me (22F) & my girlfriend, ""Lisa"" (21F) were recently invited to a dinner by Lisa's bestfriend, ""Angela"" (21F).

Angela has no family in this country and we are the only two people she knows around here. About 7 months ago she met a guy, ""Steve"" (33M) and they both quickly hit it off. Around march they started dating.

This dinner was basically an event where Steve could introduce her to his family. Angela had no company so she invited us. Lisa is familiar with Steve, met him multiple times, unlike me, I saw him once or twice, but we were happy to join. I also assume that steve was okay with us joining as well.

Honestly, it was great, everyone had lots of fun chatting. I didn't speak much except when I was talked to. The family had mom, dad and a younger brother, ""John"" (28M). I didn't see John a lot because he was cooking.

The dinner was good too, I liked the food, I finished before everyone else so I was just sitting on my chair. John maybe noticed my empty plate, so he offered me some rice dish.

I found the gesture really sweet but since I was full, the conversation went something like this - ""Hey, would you like some rice? I made it myself."" ""That's so sweet of you but no, thank you, I'm full."" ""I made it myself, please have some."" ""That's nice but I am really full, so, no but thank you."" ""I made it, taste it."" ""No, thank you."" I don't know why but he STILL poured some rice into my plate. I lost it and made the ""snarky"" comment. ""Do you not know the meaning of No? Do you need a dictionary?"" to which he looked taken aback.

Lisa noticed I was a bit pissed and said, ""please don't force her to have more food."" She said so because I have had trouble in past with food, like a boderline ED, so it was a sensitive topic which we didn't wanna discuss there.

Before things could escalate, Steve took John into his room and they both never returned. The room was filled with awkwardness and after 5 minutes his mom left too. So we decided that it's best to leave and talk about this later.

Angela didn't look angry with us but she looked disappointed and I felt bad, so we apologised to her for messing up the dinner. Regardless, she agreed with us that John's behavior was wierd but we didn't think much.

Yesterday morning, Angela showed up at our home, telling us that his boyfriend got mad at her, yelled at her for how we treated John. Turns out, John is autistic and not good with social cues. That's why he didn't really understand the situation. Steve mostly blamed me for not treating his brother nicely, for making the snarky comment and that I should've just eaten the ""god damn rice.""

I do feel bad for John but at the same time I don't think what I did was wrong either. I'm ready to apologise for Lisa and Angela, since they both look really upset but frankly, I don't want to so please tell me that if I am the asshole?

90,1egkbxz,AITA for telling my cousin that I don't want to hang out with her if she won't stop expecting me to pay?,"I (14 F) have a cousin (36 F) who won't stop expecting me to pay for all of our expenses when we go out, even when she wanted to go out. Let's call her V. V comes from a upper middle class family, she also lives in a big city and has a well paying job (something around 20000 pln a month as she got a raise lately), I come from a middle class family,we can't  afford some thing but we aren't struggling. I don't get pocket money but have some small amounts money save up, as due to my age I can't work.

Lately when we started to hang out (we hang outaybe twice a year) she started pressuring me into paying. I'm not sure why, she just told me that I'm a ""big girl"" and I can afford it, well maybe I could but it's unfair that she expects me to pay for her expensive food and drinks while I only get lemonade or tea. It wouldn't bother me so much if at leats I would be the one wanting to hang out but she was the one that initiatives it, and even better she comes to my house instead of the other way, and spends there sometimes even a week or more.

Two days ago, V came to my house again, I was happy as I really like her, despite the money problem, and she offered we'll go to a restaurant. I asked her is it some really expensive place and she said no. I of course took some money (around 200 PLN, which is  really a lot of money for me) we sat down, and I ordered some fries and lemonade, and then she started ordering the most pricey things on the menu, I don't quite remember what but she ordered a steak and some wine and then other food through the evening. I thought that since she was ordering so much and so expensive stuff she won't even dare to say a thing about me paying. Well I was wrong. I asked her how to ask the waiter about spilling the bill (as its maybe my Thiers time being in a restaurant) and she laughed. I thought she would pay for me then as I always paid for her and I only ordered things for about 30 PLN and she for about 320 PLN. But no she dropped a bomb on me saying that my father probably gave me money and that I'll pay for it. I was shocked. I told her that even if I wanted to pay for it, I just couldn't as I don't have that much money. She rolled her eyes and told me that ""I guess"" we can split the bill 50/50. I got pissed at that point and told her I won't pay for it, that it's unfair she expects that someone at the ripe age of 14 will pay for a grown ass adult meal, every time. She then told me that it's unfair she expects her to pay for herself, which is absolutely ridiculous for me, as it's not weird even a bit. In the end I just told her that I like her but I won't hang out with her if she expects me to pay for everything when she's making 7 times more than what my father makes.

91,1egk489,AITA for making my boyfriend loose his job?,"First time posting here.

So I (female 34 yo) got a remote job 3 years ago in logistics for an MLM company (like Herbal Life). The pay is good and the dedication is only part time, but I have a problem with working for this type of company. I strongly believe these are companies that ultimately live on lying to people promising they will be rich, when they won't. 

2 years ago, my boyfriend (male 34 yo) quit his job and started an NGO. I admire him for this, he did it also agreeing with me that he could help me with my work so now he does half of the work (like an assistant to me) and we split the salary between the both of us.

For this whole time, I've tried to be ok with working with this company, thinking I only work in logistics, I'm not involved in the commercial or sales or anything, but I haven't Been able to not care. In the meanwhile I got another remote job for a big traditional company.

So now I want to quit the MLM job, I can maintain both of us with my other job for some months but eventually he would need to get another job that pays him so we can have 2 incomes.

This would mean he wouldn't have as much free time as he has now to dedicate to the NGO. So he gets angry everytime I mention this, he says I'm not thankful for the opportunities that we have, that all jobs have a bad part, that is no better to work for a big company than for an MLM.

So, am I AITA if I move forward and quit the MLM job? I told him I will give us time to reaccomodate until end of year.

Edited to clarify: Im a consultant in logistics and supply chain, I current work for 2 different clients (an MLM and a traditional retail company)

My girlfriend went out with them a couple of weeks ago and they spoke about going to bottomless brunch sometime next month. She said there was only one Saturday they could all make it so her friend is going to book it.

I asked what Saturday and she said the date. I pointed out it was the Saturday we have plans so she can't actually make it. She asked if we could move our plans to another weekend but I said no since it was meant to be for my birthday. I said she can just tell her friends she's already busy that weekend and reschedule.

She just said that she doesn't know when her friends will be free next so it would probably be easier to move our plans. I just again reminded her it was supposed to be for my birthday and it hurts that she'd rather go out drinking with friends.

She said that's not true but I pointed out she's refusing to actually consider moving the plans with her friends so it is true. I said she shouldn't have made plans for a weekend that she was busy and that she'll just have to apologise to her friends.

She said I was being too unreasonable and should be open to moving the plans instead of expecting her to cancel with her friends.

96,1eghh5s,AITA for buyin a Big Mac for myself and two cheeseburgers for my parents-in-law,"The other day my parents-in-law, my GF and I were travelling through europe by train, from Budapest to Zurich. We had breakfast at 6:30 am, and the train ride was from 7:30 am to 19 pm with a 20-min transfer at Innsbruck around 14 pm.

When we approached the transfer station at Innsbruck, I was extremely hungry and suggested to get some fast food for lunch. My parents-in-law said they were not hungry and my GF thought there wasn't enough time for me to get anyfood. Anyways, they would rather board the next train instead of finding anything to eat.

As I was very hungry, I decided to go anyways, alone. I found a McDonald's at the train station and decided to give it a try.

I first ordered myself a Big Mac (5.1 EUR), and then I figured it out that it would be impolite if I only got my food and brought nothing for my GF and her parents. However, as my parents-in-law told me that they were not hungry, I only got them two cheeseburgers (1.0 EUR each). My GF did not specify if she were hungry or not, so I got her a bacon burger (4.4 EUR). It was smaller than my Big Mac because normally she eats less than me.

I paid everything all by myself.

When I got home, my GF was very angry at me because she thought that I was selfish, stingy and inconsiderate for buying her parents the cheapest hamburger possible (1.0 EUR) and a Big Mac for myself. Her parents did not know the prices though, and their cheeseburgers were almost same-sized as my GF's 4.4 EUR bacon burger.  While I defended that her parents explicitly told us that they were not hungry, my GF told me she would rather buy four Big Macs and left some uneaten instead of buying two small burgers. She also told me that I shouldn't take their words literally because they didn't want to be an incovenience to us, but apprently we will never know.

In my defense, I told her that I am already considerate for buying her parents two burgers even though they were not hungry. I could have  brought my own burger and finished it at McDo before returning to the station bare-handed, but I didn't.

Then she accused me of ""not contributing enough"" for the family trip in Europe. We are day 3 into the trip, and the trip was funded mostly by her parents. My GF paid twice (at a café and at a supermarket, \~25EUR), while I paid only once at the McDonalds (10EUR). However I also contributed my time and helped immensely with booking a hotel, finding train conenctions etc. Both my GF and I are not broke so money is not really a problem for us. That is a different story though.

So, AITA for buyin a Big Mac for myself and two cheeseburgers for my parents-in-law ? Am I really selfish, stingy and inconsiderate for doing this ?

100,1egh70c,AITA for getting angry with a friend for disappearing & letting me worry? ,"Hey, I’d like to keep this short and sweet, but unfortunately I am not the best story teller. 

I am F, 18. I went to an abandoned school for fun with 4 friends, I’ll just refer as Ava, Kayla, Julie & Isa. 

Ava & Kayla are in a romantic relationship. Julie is Kayla’s bestfriend, and Isa is a close friend of my, and Ava’s. 

Isa, Julie and I climbed to the roof leaving Ava and Kayla behind as they did not want to join. Coming back from the roof, Ava and Kayla were no longer there. I tried to ring Ava’s phone but quickly realized that she had left it with Julie. Kayla does not have a number, therefor no data, (also worth mentioning that they were both inebriated) This made me panic.

I spent 30 minutes following Julie around this place, as she knew it a lot better than I did. I went down dark hallways yelling for Ava and Kayla with no response. At this point I was worried and was thinking they either may have left, or ran into some sketchy situation or something. 
In the end, it turned out Ava & Kayla were off doing questionable things, and Julie knew of this the entire time. Julie led me to all the wrong places to give them space. I was extremely angry and spent the rest of the night being rather reserved, quiet and to myself because I was irritated to have been left to worry for so long, when everyone but myself knew. 
This being said, Kayla and Ava claim to have not heard me calling for them, which could very well be true. 

I then found out that Julie, Kayla & Ava were having a conversation about how I was ‘doing too much’ that i ‘seemed jealous’ and that if the roles were reversed, I would have done the same thing & they would have been happy for me. I found this entire situation rather disrespectful, but I can’t tell if I’m just being petty and maybe truly am angry over nothing, or if being angry in this situation is valid.

101,1eggso2,AITA for backing out on my close friend wedding as a maid of honor.,"I (33F) was asked by my very close friend (35 F) to be her maid of honor for her wedding in September. We have been friends for about 10 years, but we live in different states for the most part. Let just say we are about 4 hours flight away. 
I am very excited for her wedding and she is the best bride. She is very caring and understanding. Because of the distance,  I am not able to help her as much as i should. I do feel very bad. I did bring that point up to her during the bachelorette party (which i flew to last month). She did say between the 2 of us, that does not matter. She just wants me there at the wedding. 

I booked my plane ticket to be in her city about 1 week before the wedding. About 2-3 weeks back, i found out that I am pregnant with my first baby. She was among the first i told since i cant drink at her bachelorette party. I found out about the pregnancy before this party. She is very happy for me of course. 

After getting back from this trip, I didnt feel very well. It took me almost 2 weeks to bounce back. My husband, my family and his family all say that I should talk to my friend ( the bride) for the possibility of not making it to the wedding, since by her wedding i will be at about 10 to 11 weeks. I want to have a doctor OBGYN for professional opinion on this matter. But it seems like this dang city making it so hard to schedule an appointment. The soonest appointment where i can talk to a nurse or doctor would be about 3 weeks before her wedding.
When i google for more information, they do mention that it should be safe. I really do want to make it to her wedding and be there for her and at the same time dont want anything to happen since it is my very first time being pregnant and all. I know i need to talk to her the sooner the better. But i am torned and cant make my decision to go or not to go.

103,1eggraa,WIBTA if I keep doing my yoga without a t-shirt with children around?,"
So I (26f) am camping at a caravan site 2 minutes  away from the beach in a tent for couple  of weeks. While this campsite used to be for mostly tents, now there are about 3 grass pitches and everything else is covered with caravans that remain there year long and are all kitted out almost like bungalows with verandas, TVs, dining tables etc. My tent is in a pitch behind the back wall of one such caravan but I don't see them and they don't see me unless we walk up and down the path leading to the beach. 


A lot of the caravans belong to families with small children (3-5/6yo) and the family next to my tent is a mum with 2 children. She can't be bothered to look after them and play with them and has left them run free with their mates from the other caravans and only shouts at them when they inconvenience her. 


Now why I'm writing.


The first day my pitch was super private so I put up a string between two trees to hand my wet clothes on. The next day I came back from a short walk and everything was on the floor and the kids were stomping on it. I went and politely asked the mum that the kids are told not to trash other people's belongings and she said ""well where you've put your wet clothes is our territory and our way to the laundry room"". I doubt this is the case because  I hadn't seen her do the laundry for an entire day and a half and since that conversation she started walking past my tent to get to her laundry room 10 times a day (I counted). I kept my washing line and clothes and she hasn't said anything since but is now walking past my tent all the time doing tiny bits of washing as if there's nothing else to do. I don't mind but I can interpret this only as pettiness.


Now to my actual worry. 


I do yoga in the morning and here being in the mid 30s (Celsius) daily I can't put on too many clothes so I do it in a bralette and shorts. I do my yoga next to my tent visible from the path to the beach. Along this path the little kids rin up and down with their bikes. We haven't interacted and I have no desire to - not my children, not my problem.


The issue is, last night i woke up at 3am from the neighbors just chatting super loud in their caravan. After a bit I overheard them trashtalk how I'm doing yoga for everytone to see my ass and boobs and how inappropriate this is with little children around. Now I'm scared of doing my yoga again because I feel like the woman will come and confront me. 


 I don't feel like doing some yoga by my tent is a crime, and doing it in a bralette and shorts is no worse than walking 5 minutes further to see all the half naked people at the beach. 


However I am not great at handling confrontation and don't want to say something wrong. How can I gracefully handle the conversation and the situation as a whole?

He tries to get from me a sort of understanding “there there” but really all I can say to him is “you know she wakes up early and that forcing her to stay in bed it’s only worse (because she will start to cry loudly)”.

Also I really hate these tantrums he throws with screaming and door slamming and stupid sentences like “I will make her understand, with a (fear) trauma or else”. I just hate it. And I hate it more knowing that our daughter is the picture of joy when she goes out of the bedroom “going to daddy!”.

106,1eggd3a,AITA for cancelling holiday and ,"I’m (21, F) I just broke holiday and university accommodation plans with my friend (20, M). 

Context: over the course of our friendship there have been little beige flags like them stealing from shops when we go out, making weird loud noises when we’re at the cinema/outside. As well as getting upset with me and ignoring me, after I rescheduled plans with them, because they only had me as a close friend while I had other people. 

As well as this they love saying that they don’t like to ‘fit in’ with people and kinda have this lone wolf culture they say they’re a part of. Because of this often they come off super judgmental when I talk to/bump into more sociable or ‘mainstream’ people. I ignored this just thinking it I was being too sensitive by feeling uncomfortable by all this. 

But after a recent event everything just came flooding in and I cancelled the holiday they had invited me on and a few days later said I wouldn’t be sharing a flat with them for our next year of university. (This was university managed accommodation so they don’t need to pay my missing rent or anything.)

We had a talk after this event and I mentioned the things above and how I should have spoken up sooner. (Particularly their judgmental attitude.) But they got very defensive and upset, not really addressing it just sad that I said those things about them. 


Additionally, when I apologised again saying I also need stuff to work on (being more confident speaking up straight away, not letting it linger) there only response was “okay so how are you going to do that?”. It felt like they didn’t realise or care about the things I told them about that they do which make me upset. 

I feel bad for cancelling and apologised for doing it so last minute and told them I wish I handled it better. But after how they reacted I don’t think it’s a friendship I should be staying in. 

I think I might be an asshole for cancelling so late (3 weeks or so before the holiday and a whole summer before accommodation plans). And also feel like an asshole for wanting them to apologise. (I’ve sent them a few messages asking if they want to talk about the situation because of this- or should I just block/ignore them?)

(I’ve sent them a few messages asking if they want to talk about the situation because of this- or should I just block/ignore them?)

107,1eggc5n,AITA for complaining about my boyfriend’s family and friends to him?,"I’ve been dating this guy for five months. He took me to a family gathering. It was just simply a pool party. For frame of reference, he’s black and I’m white. It doesn’t matter to me and I don’t even notice it, he’s a great guy, but I will say I did notice it at this gathering as I was literally the only white person there. I had no problem with it and I wasn’t uncomfortable or anything. I was friends with his sister first so I mainly just hung out with her when I wasn’t with him. 

When I was in the house, I overheard his mom and other members of his family and friends saying “of course he went for the white girl” and stuff like that. I heard a similar thing from his friends a while ago saying he has a “slave mentality” and he’s the “winter soldier”. I’m offended by this stuff. Idk why it matters. But at the party, there was this family friend that his family always wanted him to get with (who’s black) and apparently he rejected her and they were like “guess we now know why”. I was just so uncomfortable that they were talking about me and him like that. I wanted to just walk into the room and say that I thought they were lovely people and I never once thought about their race. They barely know me and they were already judging me and our relationship. 

After the party, I was in the car with my bf and he asked how I liked the party and I thought about even bringing it up, but I did.

I got a bit mad that he was sticking up for me or even himself.

108,1eggad7,AITA for offering to chip in for my girlfriend’s gift for me?,"Context: I 24 M have been dating my girlfriend 23f for 4 years. This year, a few days before my birthday, my girlfriend and I were discussing what we were going to be doing to celebrate. The conversation went about as normal as you’d expect before somehow ending up on what she planned to get me as a gift. We’re not that fussy about surprises after so long of dating and we now usually discuss gifts for each other so that we get things the other truly wants or needs. (Something she started) Lately I’ve been pushing myself to be more active to get in better shape, which she has been truly supportive of. Anyways, she told me that she was planning to get me an Apple Watch so I could better track my fitness. Obviously I was very excited and wholeheartedly said that I would really appreciate it. So, we started looking online at the different watches. This was where the problem started. You see, my girlfriend is currently working part time alongside her university course, so she usually only has enough for her rent, bills, food expenses, while having around 6 - 700 dollars a month for leisurely spending. Because of this, she was looking at some of the older models online, which honestly was perfectly fine. However, I then said, “Hey, how about I chip in a bit and then we could get the latest series 9 model. It has some cool features that the older ones don’t.” After that she stopped scrolling and fell silent for a minute or two. After I asked if she was okay, she started getting a little defensive and more and more upset, before blowing up saying that me offering to chip in to my own birthday gift made it seem that her own budget and spending capabilities were not enough for me and that I was being selfish. Naturally I was shocked and didn’t know how to respond. After being shouted at like that, I naturally felt the instinct to defend myself and felt like shouting back. But, knowing how that would go, I just remained silent for a while so I could get my thoughts in order and calm down. But apparently my silence was “confirmation” of her accusation so she cried even harder before asking me to leave.

109,1egg7i3,AITA for bringing up house renovations to my dad,"So my my mum (65) and dad (64) have decided that they need to spend some money on their house as they head towards retirement. They want to make it functional (i.e. replace the heating system) and generally more enjoyable to live in. 

My dad is totally risk adverse (he would be happy fitting a new heating system and kitchen), whereas my mum has grand visions of knocking through walls and adding bifold doors to open up the kitchen to more light. I love this idea, as they spend the majority of their time in the kitchen and this part of the house is south facing so would get a lot of light. I also think my mum has to compromise a lot with my dad’s cautious approach to life. They have plenty of money to do it and are ripping up the house anyway.

Last night, I (27, M) brought up the issue of the renovations with both of them around to try and mediate a little, and help get the ball rolling. Whenever the renovations are talked about my dad just goes into a quiet mood, giving 1 word answers. He will not talk about it unless it is brought up. My mum is on eggshells not to bring it up around him.

He told me I was overstepping the mark by getting too involved. He also said my mum and I “talk about it too much”, which we only do as he outright refuses to speak about it, despite it being his idea to upgrade the house.

110,1egfnht,WIBTA if I rehomed my husband's dog even though he's against it?,"Let's call the dog Hank. We adopted Hank a yr+ ago after looking long and hard for a dog that had the qualities we wanted. The last yr+ has gone great, Hank was the perfect dog for us up until about 3 months ago.

In May we found out I was pregnant.

Hank has had a massive personality change since I started showing.

#1- he will NOT listen to any commands and refuses to go #1 or #2 when I take him outside. I WFH while my DH doesn't. This is leading to Hank having ""intentional"" accidents in the house. I say ""intentional"" because we've always had him on a good routine so I know his bathroom frequency. Now I will take him outside for 20 min and he will just stand there looking at me. So we'll go back inside for 30 min and then I'll take him back out and we'll go through the same thing.

This is causing me to be late for work because I'm having to take him outside multiple times trying to get him to do his business then instead of letting me know he needs to go out (he used to this if he needed to) he's been going in the house.

We have met with a trainer and taken Hank to the vet to rule out anxiety, boredom, nutritional deficiencies and disease. 

#2-he is becoming absolutely OCD about whatever food I eat. He has NEVER been aggressive but if he sees it close to my mouth he HAS to eat it. This includes him trying to steal a 2lb bag of grapes and 3 plum pits. At 5 months I am constantly snacking to avoid heartburn and stomach cramps which is leading me to have to crate Hank everytime I eat or drink. Which I absolutely hate.

My DH is on the fence, he sees all this stuff happening to me, he does what the trainer and vet recommended but its not changing how Hank behaves towards me.

  
DH isn't open to rehoming Hank until in his words ""something concrete happens"" so we know Hank is not a good fit.

I feel like we're already at that point and I'm scared/stressed about how this could progress. This is affecting my work which is directly affecting us financially. After the last accident I drafted up a rehoming ad for Hank and showed to DH. He got very upset and said Hank is his dog and he'll decide when he needs to be rehomed.

My boyfriend has really changed in the passed couple of years. I am honestly questioning the relationship because of his impulsiveness and random outbursts.

The latest outburst from him was when I told him I needed to water my friends plant for her when she was out of town and she gave me a strict schedule to follow since these are apparently very picky plants.

I told him no and showed him the schedule she sent and out of respect for her, I should follow that schedule. He flipped out, telling me that this shows how I don’t have any passion or drive for making things better and that by following the rules it’s just going to set me back for success in life. He even went so far as comparing this scenario to how if his grandmother had “followed the rules” she would have never escaped from the holocaust back in the day.

113,1egesvl,AITA for Telling My Husband I'd Leave His Brother if I Were My Sister-in-Law?,"First of all, English is my second language, so please forgive any grammatical errors.

My husband’s brother went abroad for a job six years ago. During the pandemic, his wife discovered that my brother-in-law had been cheating on her with another woman. They have a 10-year-old child.

Since the pandemic, my brother-in-law hasn’t returned home. I’m not very close to him or his wife, but we get along and have casual conversations from time to time since they’ve been married, and we've known each other for over 10 years.

I didn’t know about the cheating at first, but last year, during a casual conversation with my sister-in-law, I found out that my brother-in-law had been with this mistress during the pandemic. I believe she reached out to me because she was seeking help from my husband. My brother-in-law has not been supporting her or their child for years, and she confided that all his support goes to the mistress.

Now, this is where the juicy details begin.

My brother-in-law fell ill and can no longer work abroad. He wanted to return to his wife's home, which is their conjugal property. However, my husband informed me that his wife disagreed with this, which I completely understood.

My husband and his family were upset with the brother-in-law's wife because they wanted him to live with his family. I told my husband, ""No sugarcoating—if I were your brother's wife, I wouldn't accept him either.""

He got mad at me, saying that what I said was hurtful as a brother. I tried to explain that I was just being honest.

I feel like I might be an a-hole because I didn't read the room, given the brother-in-law's situation. However, my point is that they haven't been functioning as a married couple for years. He didn't return for years, got a mistress, and now that he's ill, he thinks his wife is still waiting for him.

114,1egepzv,AITA for taking a pic w/ a male coworker (CW)?,"I (35/female) attended a conference that my company plans. My CW (43/male works remotely on the opposite coast) asked me for a pic as we, along w/ others, were dressed up for a formal event on the last day of the conf. For context, this conf. lasts a week in July. I have been at this company for 11 years now. Also my CW is married & a father of 7. His wife is HOT & he is clear in that no one is to disrespect her or his family. He has never been disrespectful to me. 

My husband (35/male) and I have been married for 5 years, & he was well aware of my travel commitments for work when we started dating. I have never done anything to make him question my loyalty to him. I can’t say the same for him w/ me.

Hubby is from AL but we met while he was in PA for work. I was hesitant to get involved because of his work travel but he stayed put for 4 years of our marriage. He is working out of town again which will be the case for months to come. He hangs out w/ guys that he’s met and goes to bars. Despite things that have happened, I still feel like I can trust him so I don’t fuss. PLUS we have Life360 on our phones giving an added sense of security. 

Hubs gets upset during my conf. b/c he feels I do not call him enough. I work 10-15 hour days w/ events most evenings. I call him in the morning, when registration closes & again before bed. I do enjoy unwinding w/ CWs & attendees in the hotel bar or going out to eat or explore the area. He feels I should be in my room after registration closes & talk to him until bed time. I am always trying to maintain my composure around others during our fights.

Today, hubby & I were exchanging pics. 2 pics from the conf. are my most recent & the ONLY pics of myself that I have from it. We run the event so I take all the pics to promo the conf. but am REARLY in any. 1 of the pics is w/ my CW mentioned above. Hubby said it makes him feel some type of way & asked why I sent it to him. I worked hard to lose weight & can see a weight loss in this pic. I was in a dress & proud of the way I looked for once. Hubby has met my CW MULTIPLE times. I didn’t think it was a problem as he knows the dynamic. 

Hubby says he would never take a pic w/ a female CW b/c he knows I wouldn’t like it. I don’t know how I would feel so I can’t argue. I do know that our lines of work are very different. We build membership through promo. I take A LOT of pictures to post on our website and social media. CW ran over, said “let’s get a pic” then we went our separate ways to cont. working. 

How do I acknowledge my hub’s feelings while also letting him know that this is getting ridiculous or AITA? I’m trying to do my job & as an already anxious person, knowing he will fight w/ me has my stomach in knots. We also have 2 kids that I have to make arrangements for when I’m gone, along with a new puppy(he wanted), & huge fish tanks(his hobby).

For context, this conf. lasts a week in July. I have been at this company for 11 years now. Also my CW is married & a father of 7. His wife is HOT & he is clear in that no one is to disrespect her or his family. He has never been disrespectful to me. 

My husband (35/male) and I have been married for 5 years, & he was well aware of my travel commitments for work when we started dating. I have never done anything to make him question my loyalty to him. I can’t say the same for him w/ me.

Hubby is from AL but we met while he was in PA for work. I was hesitant to get involved because of his work travel but he stayed put for 4 years of our marriage. He is working out of town again which will be the case for months to come. He hangs out w/ guys that he’s met and goes to bars. Despite things that have happened, I still feel like I can trust him so I don’t fuss. PLUS we have Life360 on our phones giving an added sense of security. 

Hubs gets upset during my conf. b/c he feels I do not call him enough. I work 10-15 hour days w/ events most evenings. I call him in the morning, when registration closes & again before bed. I do enjoy unwinding w/ CWs & attendees in the hotel bar or going out to eat or explore the area. He feels I should be in my room after registration closes & talk to him until bed time. I am always trying to maintain my composure around others during our fights.

Today, hubby & I were exchanging pics. 2 pics from the conf. are my most recent & the ONLY pics of myself that I have from it. We run the event so I take all the pics to promo the conf. but am REARLY in any. 1 of the pics is w/ my CW mentioned above. Hubby said it makes him feel some type of way & asked why I sent it to him. I worked hard to lose weight & can see a weight loss in this pic. I was in a dress & proud of the way I looked for once. Hubby has met my CW MULTIPLE times. I didn’t think it was a problem as he knows the dynamic. 

Hubby says he would never take a pic w/ a female CW b/c he knows I wouldn’t like it. I don’t know how I would feel so I can’t argue. I do know that our lines of work are very different. We build membership through promo. I take A LOT of pictures to post on our website and social media. CW ran over, said “let’s get a pic” then we went our separate ways to cont. working. 

How do I acknowledge my hub’s feelings while also letting him know that this is getting ridiculous or AITA? I’m trying to do my job & as an already anxious person, knowing he will fight w/ me has my stomach in knots. We also have 2 kids that I have to make arrangements for when I’m gone, along with a new puppy(he wanted), & huge fish tanks(his hobby). I HATE leaving b/c of that alone, & added anxiety of the fights is too much.",0.0,0.02342616207897663,0,1
115,1egepso,AITA for completely ignoring my brother's gf?,"When my brother first told me about his girlfriend, I saw a bunch of red flags and was completely against the relationship for his own good. I tried to give my input and look out for him but he got defensive every time.

One night, us and the boys decided to do a guys night out but we all collectively agreed that none of us are allowed to bring any women around. My brother went behind my back and talked to our friends about bringing his gf so we could all meet her for the first time.

My brother and I just got into an argument about it and he said I was completely out of line for ignoring her because it was rude and embarrassing. I admitted that I was being rude but I also reiterated that I tried to tell him before hand that I wasn't cool with her coming and he ignored my request. He argued that I should have just sucked it up because she made him happy but I told him at the time, I didn't know those details of the relationship because he had only told me about the red flags.

I told him he should have met me in the middle when I tried to talk to him and tell him I'm uncomfortable with her being around instead of ignoring me and bringing her anyways, and maybe then I would have been more interactive with her if we had actually talked about it.

117,1egee7w,WIBTA for blowing up at my wife spending our life savings?,"Last month, my wife and I flew in her sister and her family of 2 to help us raise our 2-month-old daughter.

We're a working couple but she's still on her maternity leave. The tension began when sister+family needed to do a visa run. Basically what that is, is they need to leave where we are and fly to another country so that they could get a visa to stay here.

Since *we* were asking them for a favor to help us out with our daughter, at first I didn't mind that my wife was the one booking their plane tickets and hotel accommodation for the visa run. But then instead of a smooth in and out process, the thing became one problem after another. First: We drop them off at the airport and they realize they need a visa to enter the country they're going to. We all thought it was visa-free. So my wife spends our money to get their visa expedited. That also meant we had to rebook their flights with guess what? *Our money.*

Second:  This morning on the return leg. My wife received a notification from the airline that the flight is delayed. So she passes on the message to her sister. Her sister then decides to arrive at the airport at a later time coz the delay was 3+ hours. However what my wife and her sister failed to notice is a clause in the notification which states that the check-in time remains the same. So when sis+family go to the airport, the check-in gate was closed and they couldn't board. So again, my wife spends *OUR money* to book new flights for them PLUS new hotel accomo for a couple of days.

All told, 80% of our savings our gone just because of this whole exercise. She did apologize to me over spending our money but I just can't shake the feeling of: ""We worked our ass off for that savings and God knows we need it"" The real kicker in my nuts is that she's considering leaving her job to take care of our daughter which would leave me as the sole source of income in the household.

We're already at a situation where I only keep less than 5% of my paycheck and give everything to bills and towards our savings. But after this whole visa run, I'm hours away from telling off my wife to stop babying her *older* sister over this. I mean, the sister and her husband prepared savings for their journey to help us out. Why don't they spend it? Is it because we're the ones asking for a favor?

Anyways. That's my predicament now. I haven't spoken to my wife yet since I woke up and headed to work. I'm still ambivalent how I feel about this because I feel my decision in the next couple of hours could mean I'm a husband that doesn't understand or I'm a wuss for letting my wife spend all our money just like that.

**UPDATE:** I had a conversation with my wife and it was a weight off my shoulders. We decided together to set boundaries with how much we're spending towards our in-laws. I haven't opened up the matter of her quitting her job (one problem at a time).

**Some extra info:** Yes I drive a Mustang (owned it for 3 years, my wife helped me buy it and it's gonna be paid off in 2 mos.). I also collect diecast using that 5% of my salary. Everything else goes to bills and to savings. The savings I'm talking about here was meant for us to migrate elsewhere but now it looks like we're back to square one in terms of saving up. We live in the UAE.

**UPDATE 2:**  Thanks everyone for making me realize this is the price I pay for being disengaged in the process. I should've done my due diligence and helped my wife out with checking and verifying information. Plus I never thought of looking at it from an employer/employee perspective since they're family so I looked at it through that. 

Your comments made me realize it's not a you deal with your family/I deal with mine type of deal. We as a couple gotta look out for each other's backs.

**UPDATE 3:** We might get some money back because the airline they initially had booked is willing to give us a refund. Apparently other passengers got affected by the 3+ hour delay and missed the plane. Silver lining I guess. This is my final update from now. Man, everyone here has been brutally honest and it stings yes, but it’s much needed. Thank you all.

119,1ege59h,AITA for ruining the relationship with the neighbours and trust with my bf ?  ,"  My boyfriend (34M) and I have been together for 2 years. We’ve had a rocky relationship for a good chunk of time , and it’s only getting worse since we moved.

It all started when my bf(34) and me (31F) had a heated argument in our backyard. One we share with the downstairs tenants.
This sweet, loving couple witnessed everything that was said between us. 
My bf was hitting below the belt about my past trauma , motherhood, and past fights. I then started verbally swinging back. I never hit below the belt as he did, but I did mention all the terrible things he has done/said to me. I went in on him, and let my anger take over. 
I felt horrible once I cooled off , then felt embarrassed about airing out our dirty laundry for our neighbours.

The next day we both apologized. but my bf was still angry. He started to threaten me that he was going to tell his mom about my behaviour and get her to set the record straight with the couple downstairs ( ** we lived with his mom for a year, she seen our fights, when she was home, but did not hear or see everything when she was away at work) I thought he was angry and just bluffing , so i disengaged from him, told him to do whatever he thinks is best. 

The following days , we tried our best to get back to our normal. My bf and the neighbours seemed to patch things up quickly . 
 My boyfriend’s mom comes over for a visit. . In my mind, I had completely forgotten about his bluff ,  It felt like a good day. Until... I felt a shift .
While his mom was over , my bf and her went outside for a smoke. Harmless , as they both like to chitchat and smoke. He comes inside , and his mom is still outside talking to our female neighbour. I then went out for my smoke. The neighbour and my bfs mom looked at me and stopped their conversation mid sentence. At that point , I felt my intuition screaming at me.

Days pass and that nagging feeling just wouldn’t go away. so I ask my neighbour(F) if she would like to take our dog on a walk. During our walk, I asked if anything has been said about me. She had told me , that his mom indeed was talking about me , and trying to say I was a big problem for her son and nothing I say is true about him. Being a smart woman, and hearing arguments, she assured me that I’m not the problem, and she knows what goes on between us. This made me feel better , and not crazy. 

When I got back from our walk, my bf asked what we talked about, and I lied. 
Of course…. It all came out in the end , as a lie does . We got into argument about Trust , and I blurted out that I can’t trust him or his mom, as I was told she was talking behind my back for him. 
This enraged my bf , who went outside and screamed at them . When he came inside , he told me I was a manipulative person and I needed to go apologize to them. 
It’s now been a few days later and I haven’t apologized. I want to apologize, but I really want to give them space and time. 

So, the big question…..

120,1ege1kw,WIBTA for discontinuing my BD visitations?,"So I am super conflicted here. It’s a lot so feel free to ask questions. I have a son (3), Nick and I am his guardian by default (there is no court order). His bio dad, we will call him SD, has signed the paperwork claiming him and there is a support order in place but no custody agreement. I tried to file once and the sheriff was unable to locate SD in the 60 days, as he moves around a lot, so it was dropped. For the entire pregnancy and the majority of his 3 years I was the only parent. SD would come around (maybe 4 times) but disappear within a week or two. Every time he would reappear he would try to be a “family” and when he was told I wasn’t interested he was gone again. SD has 4 other children (older than Nick) which he has no custody or visitation with. He has paid a total of $36 in support in the last 3 years and doesn’t contribute in any other way.

A few months ago he got a new gf (now ex) and decided he wanted to be a part of Nick’s life. Despite the trauma surrounding Nick’s conception I decided to allow him the opportunity to be in his life. It has caused nothing but issues and I no longer want to allow visitation. I am being encouraged (pushed) by my family and husband to cut him off.
Issues: his ex gf called CPS on me as soon as they broke up. I haven’t heard from CPS, this is just what SD told me. He has no vehicle and I transport, on my dime. He also has no job. He changes employers and living situations frequently. The house he is currently staying in has smelled like weed multiple times when I drop my son off and the other children living there are unattended. Every weekend when he returns Nick, SD states that he is or has been sick and he has medicated him. SD said it was some sort of flu a few of the times but most recently said he went to the doctor with Nick and was diagnosed with scabies. He doesn’t have Nick’s medical info so there was no official paperwork for him, but SD got a script for HIS scabies. I took Nick to the doctor the same day and there were absolutely no signs of scabies, just a couple dots of eczema on his upper arms. 
Every time I go to drop Nick off he refuses to get in the car, cries, screams, and clings to me saying he doesn’t want to go with daddy. He has told me twice now he is scared but doesn’t articulate why and I don’t want to lead him with questions.

I just want him to get himself straightened out. I don’t believe it’s a good place for my son to be and I am concerned. He won’t be seeing him for the next two weeks due to his scabies diagnosis but after that WIBTA for discontinuing his visitations? I would rather we go to court and he receive supervised visitations until he can start contributing in a positive way instead of causing issues.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-31,"WIBTA for discontinuing my BD visitations? So I am super conflicted here. It’s a lot so feel free to ask questions. I have a son (3), Nick and I am his guardian by default (there is no court order). His bio dad, we will call him SD, has signed the paperwork claiming him and there is a support order in place but no custody agreement. I tried to file once and the sheriff was unable to locate SD in the 60 days, as he moves around a lot, so it was dropped. For the entire pregnancy and the majority of his 3 years I was the only parent. SD would come around (maybe 4 times) but disappear within a week or two. Every time he would reappear he would try to be a “family” and when he was told I wasn’t interested he was gone again. SD has 4 other children (older than Nick) which he has no custody or visitation with. He has paid a total of $36 in support in the last 3 years and doesn’t contribute in any other way.

A few months ago he got a new gf (now ex) and decided he wanted to be a part of Nick’s life. Despite the trauma surrounding Nick’s conception I decided to allow him the opportunity to be in his life. It has caused nothing but issues and I no longer want to allow visitation. I am being encouraged (pushed) by my family and husband to cut him off.
Issues: his ex gf called CPS on me as soon as they broke up. I haven’t heard from CPS, this is just what SD told me. He has no vehicle and I transport, on my dime. He also has no job. He changes employers and living situations frequently. The house he is currently staying in has smelled like weed multiple times when I drop my son off and the other children living there are unattended. Every weekend when he returns Nick, SD states that he is or has been sick and he has medicated him. SD said it was some sort of flu a few of the times but most recently said he went to the doctor with Nick and was diagnosed with scabies. He doesn’t have Nick’s medical info so there was no official paperwork for him, but SD got a script for HIS scabies. I took Nick to the doctor the same day and there were absolutely no signs of scabies, just a couple dots of eczema on his upper arms. 
Every time I go to drop Nick off he refuses to get in the car, cries, screams, and clings to me saying he doesn’t want to go with daddy. He has told me twice now he is scared but doesn’t articulate why and I don’t want to lead him with questions.

I just want him to get himself straightened out. I don’t believe it’s a good place for my son to be and I am concerned. He won’t be seeing him for the next two weeks due to his scabies diagnosis but after that WIBTA for discontinuing his visitations? I would rather we go to court and he receive supervised visitations until he can start contributing in a positive way instead of causing issues.",0.0,0.024694474413990974,0,1

Their dad and I eventually got together and I moved in with them which started a downward spiral! About a year later we got married and in 2020, we welcomed a surprise baby 3 months early, in the very beginning of COVID!

My mom and dad have always made me help the family with chores, paperwork, legal documents, fixing appliances, helping with raising my brother (basically teaching him everything about life) and many other things that I can't recount right now. I've done a lot to help my family, and I have started doing so ever since I was 10 years old.

Recently, my dad has been giving me the silent treatment after an argument we had (I tried to talk to him, but he's not receptive. So just gave up) that has been lasting 3 months and counting. According to my mom, he's doing this to ""punish me"" because of the result of this argument. I'd mention what it is, but I think it'll break the rules here. Despite wanting to ""punish"" me, however, has not stopped him from asking me to take care of paperwork for him or do some office work for his business for him. I gave him curt responses and it just resulted in him doing things himself thus far.

Tonight he asked me to fill out some inspection papers for his business. I have just about had it with him treating me like a literal secretary with how little he talks to me, and for his childishness as a result of the argument - rather than talking to me about things like an adult. I'll admit, I also had a really long day, so I was frustrated with being handed more work. My dad gave me papers and attempted to explain how I should fill them out and asked me to do it for him. I became furious because he had a whole other kid who he could have been asking to take care of these documents - whom of which has been playing video games all day.

I would be less mad if he had always asked us to do things equally and since a young age, but my brother is 18 and he has not filled a single form, done a single chore, done paperwork, etc. He has helped with ""manly"" chores, but so have I. The reasoning behind him not doing anything? It is, and I quote ""Your brother would do a messy job. He doesn't know how to do it and would make so many mistakes. His handwriting is also bad, while yours is good. You should do it because it's easier."" I countered by stating ""I didn't know how to do any of it at 10 years old. That was when I started, 10 years old. Your son is 18 and does not know how to fill out forms, do dishes, do laundry, clean, fill out legal documents, write emails, hell he barely knows how to write an essay.

Give it to him, get him to do it and if he doesn't understand something, teach him. I am not doing this, I don't care how it ends up."" and I stormed to my room.

128,1egcwez,AITA for confronting my friend because she criticizes everyone I date?,"My best friend Hannah and I are both F25. A year and a half ago I ended a LTR and have been in the dating scene ever since.



Hannah’s been happily married for 3 years. Her and her husband are a great match and I really look up to them as a couple. Obviously like any couple, they have occasional disagreements and/or become peeved at each other over things. Because Hannah and I are so close, when that happens she’ll usually vent to me about whatever it is to get it off her chest, but it’s never anything super serious or anything that even slightly impacts my perception of her husband. Just typical disagreements/annoyances that come up when sharing life with another person.

  


I have had a few short-term flings/talking stages and am currently two months into seeing a guy that I really click well with and plan to continue seeing. With my talking stages, anything even I’d said about them that wasn’t 100% positive, Hannah would be like “oh dump them, they’re not good for you, etc.” 



For one example, a girl I was getting to know for about a month liked to text and talk on the phone way often than I wanted, and I mentioned it in passing to Hannah. And then every time the girl’s name came up, Hannah would go on and on about the texting thing like it was the end of the world and would talk down about the girl I was seeing.



It’s been like this with every person I’d see, even if it was just one date that I told Hannah the details about she would find something to criticise in the person and pick out some reason why they weren’t right for me. A lot of times the criticisms are similar in severity (but not in topic) to the things she vents about her husband.



I really like the guy I’m currently seeing but him and I do have a few personality differences that for me it’s too early to tell if they’re dealbreakers or not. 



Hannah is as usual acting like I’m making the biggest mistake of my life by simply going out with him and getting to know him better. I talked to her about this and told her that our roles were reversed and she was just now meeting her husband I could say the same exact things about their small differences/annoyances, but they still have a great relationship. I told her that I don’t expect to agree with every single thing about someone else, and that she needs to lay off the needless criticism. Her feelings were hurt and she apologized and told me she’d stop but I could tell she was still hurt and she later told me she was hurt that I’d brought her relationship into it.



I’ve known Hannah for most of my life and genuinely believe she thinks she’s being helpful in doing this. I feel like people on AITA tend to jump to major conclusions on character, so if Hannah is TA I want to put out there that this is a friendship I plan on continuing, Hannah brings worlds more good into my life than bad, even if this specific issue has been bugging me recently.

Am I the asshole?

",No A-holes here,2024-07-31,"AITA for confronting my friend because she criticizes everyone I date? My best friend Hannah and I are both F25. A year and a half ago I ended a LTR and have been in the dating scene ever since.



Hannah’s been happily married for 3 years. Her and her husband are a great match and I really look up to them as a couple. Obviously like any couple, they have occasional disagreements and/or become peeved at each other over things. Because Hannah and I are so close, when that happens she’ll usually vent to me about whatever it is to get it off her chest, but it’s never anything super serious or anything that even slightly impacts my perception of her husband. Just typical disagreements/annoyances that come up when sharing life with another person.

129,1egctmp,AITA for ruining my Dad’s birthday celebration?,"For context, I have autism and the rest of my family doesn’t. My parents are first gen Americans around their late 40s, my sister and I are highschool age. I have been diagnosed with autism for 14 years, so my parents know of my differences. I have extreme sensory issues, like sensitivity to taste, loud noises, certain sounds, textures, etc

My family and I are at a resort to celebrate my Dad’s bd. Tonight, we went to one of those restaurants where the chef cooks in front of you. It was very noisy there, but my Mom taught me to act normal in front of others since I was young, so I made myself handle the noise to keep my Dad happy. The issue started when the chef started to hand out food, but none of my safe foods were made by the chef, causing me to decline all the food. My Dad was disappointed that I didn’t try any food and my Mom was mad at me for not having the foods she thought I was ok with. She made me go back to the room to not dampen the mood further. I left to not upset my Mom more.

These things have happened before. My parents know  of my differences but brush it off, imo this is bc they see me as normal since I am bright. When I was young, my Dad was gone on work trips, leaving my Mom to raise my sister and I. This is why I do not blame my Dad as much for brushing off my differences compared to my Mom, he has not had much of a role raising me, even when the work trips lessened. My Mom always taught me to “act normal” since I was young, forcing me to make eye contact, refusing to get me any headphones for my noise sensitivity, etc. She didn’t tell me about my autism for most of my life bc she didn’t want me to “use it as a crutch” despite me being in special needs and me being aware of it. I found out I had autism before I was told bc she did poorly hid it from me. She would still tell me I “used” to have autism. I still don’t know if this was to hide it from me or because she denied my differences. I had breakdowns when I was younger bc I didn’t know why I was different and my mom telling me I was “normal” didn’t help. My Mom thinks she did the right thing

Not long ago, my family and I went to a theme park like Busch Gardens. That night, I was more sensitive, but my Mom didn’t care. She told me “you’re not going to ruin this for the rest of the family” while she left me crying during an anxiety attack to enjoy a ride with the others. She left me again, upset that I wasn’t using my accomodations to allow the family to line skip for another ride bc I didn’t want to join for the same reason, again leaving me crying from being overwhelmed. Atp, I left the park bc I couldn’t take it anymore. I sat by the car, where my parents yelled at me for “hiding” once they found me, then grounded me for months.

130,1egcpk4,AITA for asking a stranger not to bring his dog on the field I was on?,"Back in March, I adopted a rescue dog that was supposedly “great with other dogs”. After getting him, I realized he is actually dog reactive. I have invested a lot of time in training him, and he’s made a lot of progress, but it’s still only been a few months, and he’s still very much a work in progress. He plays rather rough, and I have seen him get aggressive on one occasion because he didn’t want to share toys (no one was hurt). He is a VERY high energy dog, and I live in an apartment with a very small shared backyard. Our neighbors also have dogs.
As a result, I take my dog to a softball field at a big park everyday to fetch, run around, and just generally be a dog. Sometimes there are people on the field when I get there, so instead we play fetch beyond the outfield fence. It’s a long grassy area mostly enclosed by the outfield fence on one side, and a steep bank on the other with tall dense weeds like ferns which leads up to a guardrail beside the road. The ends of this stretch are open. 
Today while on the field, a man approached with his dog and asked if he could come on the field. I said, “he’s actually not the best with dogs.” The man takes an attitude and says, “so the whole park is yours then?” As I try to tell him “I’m only going to be here another 20-30 minutes,” he talks over me, snarkily saying “oh no, it’s fine! It’s fine” in an attitude that clearly suggested he didn’t feel that way, and walked away with his dog. 
Aside from the softball field, this park also has entirely fenced in tennis courts where I’ve seen people play their dogs, a large open field (not fenced in), walking trails, a dog park, another open area behind the home plate side of the softball field, and soccer fields across the street. No one was using any of these spaces. I did not know this man or his dog.

One of my siblings is starting school and my mom is expecting me to stay living with her to help take him to school because her and her husband are going to be working. I don't want to. I'd much rather live with my dad, its just me and him and i actually have a decent sized room at his house.

I feel kind of guilty for not wanting to help my mom and i know she's going to rage and tell me a bunch of shit when i tell her i'm not going to live with them anymore. And without me they're going to struggle alot. And i mean alot, i do everything in that house.

I know like you're supposed to be there for family but it isn't my problem. No one told her to have more kids with this fat dude.",0.0,-0.006249355152249336,0,1
137,1egb5t5,AITA for refusing to help my sister because she told our mom i didn’t want to drive her to the hospital,"
so my (22f) stepmom (47f) got bad kidney stones and had to be hospitalized for a week a few weeks back. it was very taxing on me as my dad is away for a bit and i was the one in charge of my two little sisters Desiree (19f) and Mary (12f). I had to do all of the driving, cooking, babysitting because they don’t let Mary stay home by herself. Not to mention I was still working *and* I have a freshly adopted dog who doesn’t like to be apart from her mommy(me). 

Now, this past thursday my stepmom needs to go to the hospital again and she asks me to take her. I don’t want to take her because 1) i don’t have a car, for that week i drove her car. this is inconvenient for me because her car is big, i have nowhere to park it at my complex and it’s absolutely *horrible* on gas so it’s expensive. 2) because of the lack of car i have to catch the bus to our house when it’s 110° outside, and 3) i had to go to work that day and it was inconvenient for me to drive to the hospital and back home and then go to work at the time she told me (she told me at 4 and i had to be at work by 6, the hospital is about 25 mins away) but i don’t tell her any of this obviously because it’s not her fault she’s sick and im not a brat, people do things they don’t want to do all the time. i just say ok and go to text Desiree to rant. i tell her why i don’t want to take mom and whatever. 

She than proceeds to TELL OUR MOM! she tells her everything i just said and so my stepmom says she’ll take herself. now my stepmom is mad at me and my dad is cussing me out.  because of this i cussed her out and called her dumb and that i don’t want to talk to her until we move in together in august. i’m so pissed because this isn’t the first time she’s done this, we’ve had this conversation several times before because she is constantly saying things to get me in trouble or revealing things i didn’t want revealed. 

where i think i might be the asshole is where she told me i needed to babysit Mary so she can go to work and i told her no because i had plans already and she would have to call off. i do have plans but i could easily change them but i’m just so pissed at her i don’t want to do her any favors. so am i the asshole here?

138,1egb4tt,AITA for calling my brother a ‘classist fuck’ after he made fun of his daughter’s accent?,"I (50sM) have a brother that I prefer to avoid. He isn’t a great father, he cheats on every relationship he’s ever had and he’s just mean. I see him like maybe once every two years.

So, he cheated on his first wife around 8 years ago, and she left him and took their two kids (now 18F and 21M) to live on her family ranch in a rural part of our county. He remained in the city, married the mistress and saw his kids twice in six years. 

I happened to be good friends with his ex wife’s brother, so I visited the ranch and brought my kids over regularly so my niece and nephew still knew their paternal family. They live a really great life in the outdoors, growing all their own food and living with all their relatives nearby. They’ve grown into outstanding young people with a great work ethic and appreciation for the earth. I sometimes wish I fucked off to the country and lived in a rural community too.

My niece is going to attend university out of state and she is spending her last summer visiting all the family before she goes. I organized a family dinner, and she attended and so did her father.

Living in the country for eight years, my niece has developed a country accent. It’s very mild, but you can still hear a little twang when she speaks. I personally think it’s adorable, my brother hates it and demands that she ‘speaks properly’. 

Over dinner, he kept repeating words she’d say to try and teach her the ‘proper way’ and eventually I told him to stop. He then started saying she wasn’t going to go anywhere in life sounding like a farmer and I started yelling at him and I called him classist. He looks down on his ex wife and how she chose to raise the kids he abandoned and I think it’s dumb. I said that if he was so upset about her accent, he should’ve actually raised her and I said he was a classist fuck. I reminded him that his ex wife is a very successful woman with a country accent, and her accent was one of the things he loved about her when they met. 

He stormed off and he’s demanding that I apologize. He thinks I had no right to insult him for wanting his daughter to speak properly and calling him classist was a low blow. AITA?

I wanted to start by saying that my middle daughter is black we adopted her when she was 3. Now on to the story, my mother’s birthday was last weekend and she invited the whole family. She’s a pretty dramatic woman in the sense that she loves anything with flair so it was an extremely nice dinner and because of traffic after their summer activities we got home a bit later than expected so we were in a hurry to get ready. At the moment my middle daughter hair isn’t braided and she’s been just going with a fro but she wanted a slicked ponytail for the dinner and it would’ve taken to long for her to do it the way she likes it without her being late but she asked me to do it for her. After I got done we were about 15 minutes behind schedule and wouldn’t have mad it there in time if we didn’t go as soon as I was done. The dinner went nicely even though we got their a bit late but since Saturday my youngest had been kinda cold with me so I asked her what was wrong and she told me how she felt as though I was favoring my middle over her. Of course I made it clear that I wasn’t she just needed some help with her hair and I even went to explain how much thicker my middles hair is compared to her but she hadn’t budged and I’m kinda confused I apologized and even offered to do her hair for the rest of the week but she isn’t having it she doesn’t even want to talk to me. I also want to say that I don’t do my youngest daughters hair on a regular basis unless she asks for my help so there was really no way for me to know if she wanted me to do it or no.

140,1egar1o,AITA for cancelling plans with a friend because she changed them?,"Ever since school ended, which was at the end of May, a friend and I haven't been able to see each other in person since. It has been 2 months. Let's call her Josephine. We made plans to hang out at a local shopping centre. On the day she then calls me saying she cannot go as her parents asked her to babysit her little sister at home. She called me apologising and saying that we can move it to the next day with no issues. wasn't mad and I understood her, so I agreed to moving the plans to the next day.
The next day comes around and I was sitting in my bedroom ready to leave as we agreed to take the same bus to the shopping centre. She would get on it first and then I would get on the bus she was on. I noticed that she hasn't texted me alerting me that she was on the bus that we agreed to take as it said on the bus app that the bus has departed a few minutes ago. I texted her asking for clarification and she said that she was going to take the next bus as her auntie brought her a bunch of new clothes last minute and she wanted to change. was a bit weirded out by this as it felt like a weird excuse and was also rather blunt, but I let it slide anyway. As the next bus comes around, she texts me saying that we should iust meet there and take separate buses. got mad and expressed my anger to her due to the sudden change of plans. The plans were constantly getting delayed which was ticking me off from the start and the rearrangement of buses was the last straw for me. We cancelled the plans.

Josephine kept asking me why it was such a big deal as it would be the same thing except we wouldn't take the bus together. I explained that I was thrown off by the sudden change of plans and no longer wanted to go as she gave little explanation and just changed the plans suddenly. She later called me out of the blue and asked me to elaborate as to why i'm mad. I explained that the multiple delays were inconvenient. She then said that it's not a big deal as it's summer and we have all day. For context, I had plans after the hangout with her. I then also said how I didn't like how she changed the plans so suddenly at the very last minute. She kept telling me that she doesn't understand how it's a big deal and that if I was to do the same to her she would not react the way that I did.

I overall just feel like my feelings are invalidated and overlooked. The hangout was constantly adjusted to Josephine's convenience and didn't like that. It's also more so the principle rather than the actual situation that made me upset. She kept changing the plans with little sympathy and when expressed my unhappiness to her she invalidated my feelings completely.

I, (14f), get really tired (especially w/ out food), really easily. Sometimes to the point where I get light headed and nearly pass out. Idk why. The reunion was on my dad's side, where there is a LOT of political division.

The reunion started at 11ish AM. I had a light breakfast, so around 11:30 I was starting to get really hungry. And, my whole (adult) family was yapping and arguing about the presidential elections, so I was really bored. All of the older guests were also hounding me about how I've gotten so skinny and how I need to eat more. I didn't want to be with my younger cousins for obvious reasons, and I didn't feel like getting in the trampoline with the ones my age, since a headache was kicking in.

Then, I found my cousin's room (13f). It had a really comfy bed, and a bunch of books. One of them was Percy Jackson, the Chalice of Gods. I hadn't read that one yet, and I'm a hardcore PJ fan. So, I asked my cousin if I could crash on her bed, and read some of her books, where she agreed.

I think I read for 2 hours, until my aunt burst into my room, angry. She started yelling at me about some ""Your whole family has shown my US disrespect,"" and started rambling on how rude I was. The room looked exactly the same as how I first came in. Then it was lunch, and some people were mad at me, others were on my side, and a few didn't give a flying fck.

I told her I would come yesterday after I got off work but I never came so I texted her this afternoon letting her know I was tired and exhausted and I wished her luck at her new job. She told me she missed me and I said the same. Cool, but now hours later she’s double texting me asking me if I will come once I get off work today. She keeps asking me the same question all week. Plus I said I was tired. I texted back with “I’ll get there when I get there, I told you I’m tired” she found this response rude and apologized, I didn’t respond back. AITA, for what I said? She was practically begging me to come over. I get it, this is what I usually do and I spend half the week with her but I haven’t been there in 4 days for a REASON. ",1.0,1.0526206493377686,1,1
145,1eg9h7g,AITA for telling my sister to stop using my things?,"This is actually a bit more complicated than the title because I wasn't the one to tell her. So I, 20 F, had a talk with my mum the other day about what to do since my sister, 22 F, keeps using my stuff and everytime I tell her not to she denies it and blames it on me for not remembering. 

For some context, I'm in college and super broke. I was working with my mum during college and planned to continue for the summer but then my sister hated her job so my mum gave her my job. Long story short, I couldn't find a job for a couple months and my savings aren't lasting forever so while I wasn't a stickler about it before I'm starting to be a bit more now. I just don't think it's fair that she takes my items when she has her own money to pay for things. It's really not my fault she eats out so much. If I had her income, I’d have savings, just saying.

The actual AITA part is where I told my mum and then my mum decided to tell her in an argument before I even had the chance to say anything. My sister once again started saying that we talked about the milk and she said she'd buy some. And that she didn't even take that much. My points were she didn't ask to take it in the first place and she never said that but at this point it's turned into he said/ she said again and it looks like my mum is taking her side. She seemed to believe that my sister had told me before but honestly I feel gaslit once again by my sister because we never had that conversation. The timing doesn’t even line up cause I haven’t talked to her in a couple days and she says it happened yesterday.

Anyways, sorry for the long winded story, I'm not sure which parts are import any to making a conclusion. In short, AITA for complaining to my mum about my sister using my items without asking?

Edit: they aren't big items but she's been doing this for months so it's been adding up. Generally things like shampoo, conditioner, body wash, toilet paper, milk, eggs, butter. Once again, I can't buy much so there's not much to take in the first place lol",Not the A-hole,2024-07-31,"AITA for telling my sister to stop using my things?
