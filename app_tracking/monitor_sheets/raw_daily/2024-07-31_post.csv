0,1egqrlb,AITA for angrily coming out to my brothers?,"Relevant characters: me (32 NB) my mom (63 f) and my brothers Chuck(42 m) and Tyler(30 m). Growing up I always had a bad relationship with my tyler but with chuck was good. As adults tyler apologized for bullying me growing up, and our relationship has improved but we're still not close. Growing up me and tyler played rugby, my mom was into it, and so was my chuck.

I'm non binary but very passing and before this only out to my mom. 

About two months ago chuck sent me a transphobic reel specifically about nb people. I told him it wasn't cool and we had a short but civil conversation about it. I thought it ended ok. 

My family has never been the type with a running group chat that gets active regularly, but my wife's does. I guess I've always kinda wanted that from my family so occasionally I'll make an effort to text the group chat. Earlier this week I started texting about the USA rugby sevens at the Olympics. Specifically about the women's taking bronze. Ilona moher is a beast, and a national treasure. I asked if they had seen the bronze medal match and sent a TikTok of it.

Tyler responded by saying he can't watch the Olympics because of the opening ceremony. He explained they ""mocked Christianity on an international platform."" Chuck agreed and said that people today are crazy. 

I responded maybe slightly aggressive just trying to calm their anger. I said ""Even though the organizers have already said that it was the Greek god dionsys and have apologized for it's resemblance to the last supper? The Olympics are Greek. We don't have to be offended by everything, art like this is subjective and people can accidently send messages they don't intend.""

My brothers then said they were lying, they know what they saw, they're allowed to be offended. 

Then chuck posted screenshots of our Convo from last month, saying I was offended by this video. I think this is where I saw red and was seriously hurt. I feel like this was a violation of privacy. 

The Convo moved onto them complaining about trans athletes. 

Eventually I responded: ""I was offended by the video because it was being openly cruel to non binary people. And I'm fucking non binary. The blue man at the Olympics could be interpreted as an attack on Christianity. That video specifically said ""I don't respect non binary people""

Crickets. 

My mom made a comment that were allowed to have different opinions and don't need to argue. She also texted me separately to see if I was free Friday, and sent some reels. I haven't responded to any of them. 

By brothers haven't said a single thing to me which is kinda driving me nuts.

My wife says I should be pissed at all three. My brothers for being assholes and my mom for not defending me. I'm used to my mom doing this.

I just feel like an asshole for getting that angry, and yelling. I'm also afraid that chuck is not let me see my niece. ",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-07-31,"AITA for angrily coming out to my brothers?

1,1eg95xz,AITA for telling my roommate that I’m going to have sex whether she is there or not?,"For context, we are living in school campus housing and each individual has their own room in the 4 bedroom apartment. 

Basically, two of our roommates have graduated and two of us were left behind. My room is right next to hers. As me and my roommate were discussing potential new roommates, I was talking to her about how we should apply the same rule about how it’s okay to have guests over, just let everyone know ahead of time. She agreed, but told me she has this boundary due to something that happened to her friend (EDIT: it has to do w the friend’s roommates sexual activity, idk any more than this) in which if someone had a significant other (which I do), they are not allowed to have sex when ANYONE is home. I asked what if we’re trying to be quiet? And she laughed in my face and said impossible. I asked if it’s just her or when anyone is home? She said anyone.The way she said it so sternly caught me off guard and made me feel inferior in that moment. Our conversation ended, and this didn’t sit right with me because I don’t think it’s anyone’s right to dictate whether you’re intimate with your partner or not unless you share the same room. We each pay the same amount to live in our own rooms. And I was also wondering why she decided to only say this now and not when every single person first moved in to the apartment (and one of them happened to have a boyfriend as well, but she never stayed at the apartment). She is an older student in her mid-late 20’s and is also very Christian, and I felt like she was applying her own values or discomfort with sex onto me. And the one time my boyfriend was over, everyone else was out of town. So I texted her the next day that we need to revisit that convo. 

The next day comes, I first ask her what happened to her friend that made her set up this rule? She replied saying that she thought about it and she was being a little unfair because what her boundary may be may not apply to our future roommate’s boundaries, so as long as SHE isn’t home, I can have sex. I told her that my boyfriend and I are long distance and I only see him one weekend every month or month and a half, so imma have sex REGARDLESS of her being home if I wanted to, and that if we shared a room or if I was being loud and obnoxious, that’s an entirely different story. She looked caught off guard but I left it at that, but I kind of want to revisit the conversation again and make it a point that I don’t know whether she is in her room all the time and it’s literally weird for me to be worrying about HER and whether she is home or not when I want to be intimate with my partner and that if the idea of sex alone makes her squeamish then she needs to grow tf up. Should I? AITA?

Edit: Thanks for your responses. I won’t revisit the convo w her unless there’s a need to and I’ll do it in a respectful manner while trying to be reasonable! DISCLAIMER: I always let her know a week or weeks in advance before my bf comes over and remind her the day before.

2,1eg95en,AITA for moving out of a toxic sharehouse?,"I (29 ftm) lived with my “friends” Layla (30 mtf) and Adrian (23 ftm) for 2 years. We were all quite close, and Layla and Adrian were dating. Adrian moved in with us after only being with Layla for a short amount of time, and I’m pretty sure that they knew each other when Adrian was a minor. We were all mentally ill and traumatised, but we worked well together. However, there were problems. The house was always an absolute mess, there was rubbish everywhere (not mine), and the kitchen was always full of dirty dishes. My room was clean and I needed to keep a mug, bowl, and spoon separate otherwise I wouldn’t have anything to use. While living with them, I wasn’t doing well, I was abusing weed and alcohol, but at the time I didn’t realise that these behaviours were a coping mechanism related to my environment. I did so much for my “friends,” I would always drive them around without getting financially compensated, but I refused to clean up after their mess.

I would often go to my ex-boyfriend’s (28 m) house to get away from everything. It would take a few days for my mood to settle, and when I went home again my mood would drop as soon as I entered the door. Layla and Adrian kept inviting people who would otherwise be homeless to live with us, and while they always asked me first, I felt like I didn’t have much of a choice. One of these people was a 20-year-old (Beau) with a baby who was in a new relationship with Layla (they were poly), and the age gap made me uncomfortable. There was also an 18-year-old (Will) who was in trouble with the law. Beau and Will brought a lot of trauma into our house and the mess got worse. I tried to talk to my housemates about the mess and that it was affecting my mental health but nothing changed.

As everything at home got worse, so did my mental health. My memory has always been quite bad and I forgot something quite important which broke Layla’s trust. I no longer felt self in my home and I needed to get out of there, so I organised to move in with my ex. I did not give much notice since it was quite urgent, and while I recognise that I should have given more warning, but I needed to get out of there. Upon moving out, I was under the assumption that four people with incomes would be able to cover rent and other expenses. After I moved out, Layla sent me a very long and detailed message abusing me, claiming that she never believed me when it came to my memory, and called me a manipulative liar. I was so shocked and upset that I didn’t stand up for myself. Layla later called me to verbally abuse me and hung up before I had a chance to say anything. I was good friends with her for years and I considered her to be family, but I guess she was never my friend in the first place.

Layla, Adrian, Beau, and Will stopped paying rent and abandoned the property, leaving the fridge, washing machine, personal belongings, rubbish, and dishes. After moving out my mental health improved, and I stopped drinking and smoking weed.

3,1eg92b4,"AITA for ""fact checking"" someone after they told me something interesting?","Throwaway because friends follow my main.

So, a little bit of back story.  
I love anything and everything about fun facts, tidbits, general trivia and the like and if someone says to me ""hey OP, wanna hear a cool fact?"" You're damn right I do. If I haven't heard it before and I find it interesting I will often Google what they told me to learn more and on some occasions even offer additional information to the person who told me so we can have a discussion about it.

Here is where I want to know if I am the asshole. I was with some friends at a pub last weekend and I met some friends of friends. I struck up a conversation with ""Lucy"" and everything was going fine. We began talking about history - a vice of mine - and she told me about the origins of ""The V"" for those that don't know, in the UK instead of flipping someone the bird you give them the V which is holding your index and middle finger in a V shape with your palm facing inwards, essentially means ""*fuck off*."" (if anyone is curious to the origin I can explain the comments)

Once she told me the origin I was fascinated and googled it to find out more and began reading what I found to continue the conversation with more information. This is when Lucy's tone completely shifted and she asked me, quite sternly,  
Lucy ""did you not fucking believe me or something?""  
Me ""...Sorry?""  
Lucy ""you heard me, why did you feel the need to fact check me?""                                                                          Me ""I wasn't fact checking you I was...""                                                                                                                      Lucy ""Shut the fuck up (insert word i'm probably not allowed to type)""

Then she got up and stormed off, the other people around us saw what happened and were just as confused as I was, but we kinda shrugged it off and continued as normal. I was thinking about her reaction all night and it definitely put a downer on it for me.

The next day I asked my friend - ""Ben"" - who knew her if she had said anything about yesterday and Ben said that Lucy had reached out to him and proclaimed that I am a ""huge piece of shit and I know what I did."" Ben asked me what I did and I told him and he was just as confused as I am.

He told me to post on here to get the opinions of internet strangers.

So, AITA for ""fact checking"" someone? I don't think I did anything wrong but maybe I did and am willing to listen/learn from it!
