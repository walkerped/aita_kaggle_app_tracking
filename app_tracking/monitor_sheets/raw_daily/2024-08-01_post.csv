It doesn't even sound different) and because it is foreign from the country my dad is from (which it isn't we have Oskar here as a totally normal name plus.. my dad is from that country. It would be totally ok to be named a name from his country. Oz it more commen there than here). And that she just woll call me [Deadname] no matter what.

I don't wanna go to visit them anymore. I just don't want to. Not until they call me Ozkar or just stop deadnaming me.

Now to the problem: my ex isn't alloud to go anywhere with the children, without me or a professional.
The greatgrandparents of my children can't drive anymore. It isn't nearby so they can't go by bus or train because of there age. I could go with the children for two or three nights a year or something. But I just don't want to sleep there or even be at their house.

My children never ask to see them but they are their great grandparents and would like to see their great grandchildren.

So WIBTA if I don't go to visit them with my children (until they stop deadnaming me, which probably won't happen)?

There where other things too, like they inplied if my ex wanted to come at the same time (which I wouldn't even ask my ex) we could all sleep in the guestroom. As I would allow my children to sleep in the same room like my ex... After my ex wanted to burn down the house we all were in when hallucinating because not being able to sleep. I wouldn't even sleep in the same house anymore.
But nothing that would be a problem if I say we won't come in this case.

1,1ehexlf,WIBTA if I said I wasn’t comfortable about a group fancy dress idea?,"I (19F) am part of a friendly camping group with my family and a few other families. Every year we attend a small local camper van event with a themed costume party. Usually we are voted best dressed as we are a large group who are able to put a lot of time into our costumes. It is also a very jokey event and isn’t super serious. The overall theme this year is Kings and Queens. Last time I saw the group the ideas ranged from Knights of the Round table to Monty Python and the Holy Grail. But without consulting my family, some of the others decided on the theme of drag, which I found out this morning from my mum. 

I am the only person (who I know of) who is queer in the group but I am not trans nor do I do drag, and most of the group (my friends and the event) consists of Gen X people, with one of the dads (I’ll call him Mark) having a bit of a habit of saying things that have made me uncomfortable in the past (lowkey homophobic, transphobic and racist jokes). I would suspect that the entire thing is his idea as he is best friends with the mother from the family (I’ll call her Tina) who organises the costumes, and she tends to be a bit of a pushover as she hates upsetting people. One of the kids (18M) has performed in Kinky Boots in drag but is not queer and I haven’t had the chance to talk to him about it, which is the only experience that anyone in the group has with drag that I know of.

I worry that they will take the theme too far, start doing offensive stuff and portray really harmful stereotypes. My gut reaction was that the idea could become offensive really quickly with some of the people involved. The whole dress up event is supposed to be super comedic and I think that this particular theme isn’t suitable as it portrays real experiences in a current community which in an already difficult time for LGBTQ+ people like myself. But at the same time, I’m barely an adult and not super close to anyone in the group like some of the others are. I could cause fallouts or argument within the group which could result in my family getting kicked out if Mark gets in a really nasty mood about it. Tina had good intentions but has had trouble standing up to Mark in the past which has resulted in a family leaving the group before. 

I raised my concerns with my mum (55F) and sister (16F). My sister brushed me aside and said that there was nothing wrong with it and I could just not participate. My mum said that she could suggest other themes to the group like playing cards or something. I was also told that my Dad hasn’t been told about the theme and I know that he would be very uncomfortable with dressing up in a drag.

Would I be TA if I raised the issue further with the rest of the group, which could potentially cause a rift in the group and get my family kicked out?

2,1eheq0g,"AITA for refusing to share my recipe w gf's family, and tearing into them abt neglecting her?","To clarify, my girlfriend is trans, which is why I could almost carry a child. She's only in contact with her uncle Rob, his wife Jen, their son, and her grandma. I got along with them until they kidnapped my girlfriend while I was in hospital. They live on the outskirts of a city, with no public transport access unless they drive her to the city centre. It was their son's birthday and I convinced my girlfriend to go, I felt bad she was stuck in the hospital w me. From the hospital it was only a 1 hour bus trip, and she said she'd only be there for a couple hours. I had suffered from a miscarriage, i was kept overnight for monitoring. They wouldn't drive her to the bus stop, forcing her to stay overnight. They knew why i was in the hospital, but ""family comes first."" so, i know where i stand.

Afterwards, we decided to limit contact and only respond if they reached out. We recently moved into a new house, and they asked to visit. We declined, but they're very persistent. Since everyone in the family went to culinary school, I cooked something simple—my nan’s steak with bourbon garlic cream sauce. Rob liked it and asked for the recipe, but I didn't really want to share my family heirloom recipe, so i playfully said, ""It's mostly love."" Rob started yelling at me, and accused me of fearing he'd show me up since he went to culinary school, and my girlfriend wouldn't rely on me anymore. I asked who else she could rely on, he did not like that, and got louder.

I reminded him they could have taken her out of an abusive home anytime but chose not to, because they didn't want to go near her mother. they chose spite over protecting their own nieces and nephews. I said she was forced to rely on me, because they weren't there. She was removed from her home, and put in with a foster family, separated from her siblings and then when the foster family moved, she had to live with my parents. i was 16. she had to move in with her 16 year old girlfriend.

3,1ehbe62,AITA for just wanting to leave without saying a word?,"Story's like this. I'm 35 MTF, Partner is 43 F and chronically Ill with Fybromyalgia, Autism,  thyroid disorder.  
Met and partner met over 15 years ago and I joined her already Poly relationship, although person 3 left. 2 Years ago I met someone in an MMO called Final FantasyXIV, and after talking with my current partner I got the OK. We've been dating for a year now. 

Point is I probably started feeling things for my other partner because current partner really made me feel horrid in hindsight. Her illness has made it so I basically do everything around the house next to my 32 hour job. I come home, cook, help take care of the pets. And until recently I made her breakfast every day, give her water, drive her to her ""Job"" (she makes art once a week and posts it on social media, her income is from disability.

Partner was initially against my transition to a woman, but said it was ok because ""we needed eachother.""  
Recently I sorta snapped, and we called a friend, we talked things over and said my partner should be more self sufficient, aka, get her own water (instead of whatsapping me she needs it and getting mad if I don't answer in 5 mins). This is hard on her she said. And anything big happening puts her in a meltdown. 

I appreciate she's willing to try but me having to hug her and her constantly telling me I can't leave her alone is emotionally draining me. I tried telling her but she keeps twisting at to the point I'm telling her I am not leaving and I love her, but honestly I don't. I wish her well, but her constantly asking me if I still love her, telling me she's helpless without me makes me just wanna run away. 

Other partner lives on the other side of the planet, I am not running to another woman who accepts me. I just want to do my job and get a small apartment and relax after work instead of spending time with my current partner playing boardgames, to hear 2 hours later it wasn't enough.

4,1eh7muc,AITA Monthly Open Forum August 2024: Remembering Assholes,"# Keep things civil. Rules still apply.

Let’s do a little spin on our “tell us about a time you were the asshole” deal from a couple of months back. But this time, let’s remember the assholes we’ve lost. I mean that in the best way possible. To be clear, this is not intended to be a “let’s shit on the dead” type of thing. If you want to rant and rave about someone whose grave you’d rather piss on, I’m sure there’s a sub for that.

What we’d like to see here is something about an asshole in your life that you’ve lost. But, you think back on them fondly and smile. Even when thinking about some of their asshole ways. I know I certainly have someone like that. And I do miss them. Even with their assholery, I’d much rather have them here.

So, tell us about that asshole that’s moved on. As we've done in the past, some sub rules can be relaxed a little. For example, it’s OK if your tale involves a relationship. But, we still cannot host anything that mentions violence.

6,1eh3aag,WIBTA? Skipping coworkers funeral?,"My coworker had passed away over the weekend & today was her service. Now I wouldn’t consider this coworker and I super close, but I did know her. We worked together often, she was my superior and we would talk often on our shifts, gossiping and messing around. (We work in healthcare, nightshift).  I would have considered her someone I really liked at work and enjoyed seeing us on the same shift together. However, I had only known her for a year and a lot of my other colleagues have known her for 5+, so that being said, I knew her the least. There is a group of them that are all very close and tight knit that ended up planning on attending the service together then going out for dinner and I was not invited. I was a bit upset by this but tried not to take it too to heart because in all fairness, I only know all of them on a surface level basis and vice versa, so I understood why I wasn’t included, it’d probably be weird if I was. But it got me in my head thinking, is it even appropriate for me to go to the service? Do i still pay my respects? Or is it inappropriate because I didnt know her through and through or for that long? I dont know, I am a chronic overthinker. I had donated some money towards the family and signed a card along with some other coworkers too, maybe thats enough?
Anyways, I intended on going to the service after the group of them had gone and when I got there I got really bad anxiety and left. Now I am filled with guilt about not attending and feel awful. I am beating myself up for letting my anxiety and insecurities dictate this because it isnt about me. AITA for overthinking and being selfish or is it not that extreme? 
There is another service tomorrow morning for an hour right before the funeral but I figured that one was more intimate for family.

7,1eh31ni,AITAH if I want to elope?,"Key context points are:

-fiancees mom has not liked me since day 1 before she even met me
-his mother threatened him if we were to elope
- we recently got a house and his mom has been trying to make it hers since he's her sun
-his mother crosses boundaries and can never say nothing good about me no matter what.
-just had a house warming party and his mother made it all about her told everyone what to bring when we spent a couple hundred buying food for guests (honestly didn't need anything else food wise) that and made sure people knew that her gift was for my fiancee not us both.
-i am constantly attacked and just sick of the narcissistic behavior not only towards me but him too

On to the story. I 26 f and my 25 m fiance (Zeke)
Got engaged last year November. After after seeing all of the prices of how much a wedding costs, I knew it wasn't meant for us. We are both introverts and we both shy away from the spotlight so a wedding would not be ideal for us. But his family continues to want us to have a big elaborate wedding because we have been together for almost 9 years now. I would rather spend the money on a trip just for the two of us. 

 So I want to elope or do a courthouse wedding. But after everything that his mother puts me through, I only want it to be us. I don't want his family there and I'm not much of a family person myself. That is the back story in itself as my parents got a divorce and it was very messy. My so-called Father has turned my family against me and I have not heard from them in years. 

About a year ago my grandmother passed that was on my dad's side. I went to her funeral. Being there brought back so many. I told his mother that it was not a good experience for me.

Any happy moment that me and my fiance share She has to ruin it by bringing up my family and asking if they will come. I have not told her the whole story as she does not deserve to know my truth. 

There is so many things that she has said about me that truly hurt me. I try to be a great person and not let it get to me but at the end of the day I just want her to like me. She is the love of my life's mother. 

After our housewarming our house was trashed. Many people including his mom wore their shoes on our white carpet. And we decided to rip the carpet up as we spent 6 hours the day prior to clean for the party. The carpet was so disgusting that we had to. 

Months prior his mother paid about $90 to get it professionally cleaned for us as we were moving in. His mother called her sister to complain that we got rid of our carpet and it was Zeke's fault that she wore her shoes on the white carpet. And we had no right to get rid of it. 

I want to have a courthouse wedding with just the two of us and nobody else. I feel like it is the best decision for us. He says that he wants to give me the wedding of my dreams. But honestly all I want is to just marry him. I would be happy to just wear a white dress at McDonald's if it meant marrying him. 

So am I the asshole if we decide to get married alone? ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-01,"AITAH if I want to elope? Key context points are:

-fiancees mom has not liked me since day 1 before she even met me
-his mother threatened him if we were to elope
- we recently got a house and his mom has been trying to make it hers since he's her sun
-his mother crosses boundaries and can never say nothing good about me no matter what.
-just had a house warming party and his mother made it all about her told everyone what to bring when we spent a couple hundred buying food for guests (honestly didn't need anything else food wise) that and made sure people knew that her gift was for my fiancee not us both.
-i am constantly attacked and just sick of the narcissistic behavior not only towards me but him too

On to the story. I 26 f and my 25 m fiance (Zeke)
Got engaged last year November. After after seeing all of the prices of how much a wedding costs, I knew it wasn't meant for us. We are both introverts and we both shy away from the spotlight so a wedding would not be ideal for us. But his family continues to want us to have a big elaborate wedding because we have been together for almost 9 years now. I would rather spend the money on a trip just for the two of us. 

 So I want to elope or do a courthouse wedding. But after everything that his mother puts me through, I only want it to be us. I don't want his family there and I'm not much of a family person myself. That is the back story in itself as my parents got a divorce and it was very messy. My so-called Father has turned my family against me and I have not heard from them in years. 

About a year ago my grandmother passed that was on my dad's side. I went to her funeral. Being there brought back so many. I told his mother that it was not a good experience for me.

Any happy moment that me and my fiance share She has to ruin it by bringing up my family and asking if they will come. I have not told her the whole story as she does not deserve to know my truth. 

There is so many things that she has said about me that truly hurt me. I try to be a great person and not let it get to me but at the end of the day I just want her to like me. She is the love of my life's mother. 

After our housewarming our house was trashed. Many people including his mom wore their shoes on our white carpet. And we decided to rip the carpet up as we spent 6 hours the day prior to clean for the party. The carpet was so disgusting that we had to. 

Months prior his mother paid about $90 to get it professionally cleaned for us as we were moving in. His mother called her sister to complain that we got rid of our carpet and it was Zeke's fault that she wore her shoes on the white carpet. And we had no right to get rid of it. 

I want to have a courthouse wedding with just the two of us and nobody else. I feel like it is the best decision for us. He says that he wants to give me the wedding of my dreams. But honestly all I want is to just marry him. I would be happy to just wear a white dress at McDonald's if it meant marrying him.

9,1eh2t8m,"AITA? I accidentally broke a sentimental object that was put in a hidden, dangerous place.","Am I the asshole and is the liability mine?

I accidentally broke a sentimental statue belonging to my housemate.

I was taking down hanging plants to get fresh soil. I asked if they wanted me to take down the plant in the stairwell, they said yes. 

While taking the plant off the hook, the plant dragged a statue off the window ledge that smashed on the landing.

My housemate wept and ran into their room, slamming the door.  The statue was an anniversary gift to him and his now dead spouse. It is also a numbered edition that was only made in one batch, several years ago.

I felt like absolute poo. He yelled that I had to replace it.  A couple days later he asked what I’m going to do about the statue.

Immediately following the crash, I collected every last shard and reached out to an old friend that restores art. He quoted me $800 to restore it to perfect, $400 to restore it to good. This is a significant discount, as we’re friends.

I’ve checked online for a replacement and the going prices are $450+.

I recently left my job because I’m moving out of the country, imminently. This is an exorbitant expense, especially with no income.

The statue was twice the size of the window ledge, hanging off substantially, and it was completely hidden behind the plant. I didn’t see it. I couldn’t have known it was there unless I was told or searched for it. 

To me, the sentiment warrants restoring the original, rather than buying a replacement. 
However, if it was so special, why would he put it precariously on a high window ledge, hidden behind a plant?

I empathize with my housemate, deeply, and if I were working, I’d replace it without question. Given the cost and my financial situation, it’s not an expense that I can casually afford. 

I was doing something to help my housemate, and it seems to me that the responsibility falls to him for putting it where/how it was. He knew it was there and said nothing about being careful removing that particular plant.

Does this make me the a-hole?

It’s true that while my grades are good, I’m not in a relationship and most certainly not looking. Amy however, is engaged to her high school sweetheart and they just moved in together. 

Our annual family reunion was last weekend, and she was there with her fiancé, absolutely ecstatic to show off the ring to everyone who would listen. I however, was off to the side on my phone. I don’t have a great relationship with that side of the family, I just wanted to keep my head down.

One of my uncles spoke up and asked how school was going. Amy piped up and said, “He’s fine with his computer games as always, you don’t have to pretend to care.”

Here’s where I may be the butthole. I said, “School is fine. I’m making good friends too, especially because you aren’t shitting all over them because you were embarrassed about your weight.”

One of my uncles spoke up and asked how school was going. Amy piped up and said, “He’s fine with his computer games as always, you don’t have to pretend to care.”

Here’s where I may be the butthole. I said, “School is fine. I’m making good friends too, especially because you aren’t shitting all over them because you were embarrassed about your weight.”

She stormed off in a huff, and my family is upset that I said that about her, and it was a low blow to comment on how she looked after she said something harmless.

17,1ehuw4y,AITA For telling my coworker hes not allowed in my car anymore,"Hey all, long story short I have a new car(2023)that everyone around me knows how I baby my car since I bought it with cash, and its my first car. I do everything possible to ensure no one hits my car, and It cant be damaged.

I normally get my coworkers drinks every friday once a month, I normally drive alone because I dislike people in my car cause I have anxiety thinking they are judging my driving skills (i drive really safe) and Ive had issues with people dirtying my car (kicking door and leaving mud etc)

This time my male coworker whos 4 years younger then me asked if i could take him pick up booze since there has been a strike going on and he doesnt drive. (his parents drive him everywhere). I said sure, so i dropped him off, went to pick up drinks and came back.

After i went to go grab him, he put all his small mickey drinks in a cart and pulled up next to my car. In my head im thinking hes gonna hit my car door cause the cart is too close. He then proceeds to get distracted by a nearby car and swings my door open into the cart. There are like 3 down to metal marks on my door and I was pretty upset. I didnt see the damage till we got back to work, I walked into the office and basically said its bad and down to metal so it needs to be touched up.

I sent him a picture and he proceeds to say ""at least its small no one can see it"". I tell him well I need to cover it up with a paint marker its a new car, and he proceeds to say ""but its small you can barely see it"" trying to avoid giving me 10 dollars.

Now this kid has been cheap before and not paid for the drinks i buy the group, i have to keep reminding me. So ontop of that, and now him basically being rude and refusing to take responsibility for his mistake, he minimizes the damage hes done and refused to pay for it. I then told him, I give everyone one chance in my car, and then you arent allowed back in it. I apologized and said thats a boundary I set for my own peace of mind and I have to abide by it.

After this occurred (last friday), I was gone until today from work and he did not offer any money to me or message me to further apologize. He now wont speak to me at work and never even tried to offer a conversation to speak through what happened.

Half my friends think I may have overreacted (people who have always been financially stable, some not). Some are saying If he didnt have the attitude he did maybe over reacting, but he was very disrespectful and didnt take accountability for his mistake.

TLDR; Coworker dinked my car cause he moved cart too close after i was doing him a favour, refused to pay for paint marker that I have to buy to cover it up to prevent rust.

18,1ehus4p,AITA for asking my grandma not to have my cousin come over,"My grandparents (81 f 85 m), my mother (59 f), and myself (33 f) recently moved into a shared home in order to help take care of grandpa. I also have a cousin (40ish m) who recently moved near by after a stint of being homeless.

My grandma has carried guilt about my cousin for years now. His mother died accidently and his father doesn't help him in any way. We hadn't been in contact woth him for years and he only reached out to us maybe half a year ago.

Our lives aren't great, but we get by. My grandpa has alzheimers and we all help take care of him (excluding cousin), though most of the less savory work falls to grandma and sometimes mom. Most of the house work falls on my mother and I. He wets himself multiple times a day and night so his bedding and clothes get washed extremely often. 

A few days ago when I was doing laundry, I found a dead bedbug in the dryer lint. I about had a mental breakdown. We just got here and now we potentially have to go through the mind crushing task of dealing with BEDBUGS. I was catatonic until a bedbug sniffing dog came in to check the place and we were cleared. 
We recently had a carpet beetle issue in our old place, which I dealt with mostly on my own, I'm not mentally in a space to deal with something much worse. 

What this has to do with my cousin is this, only 2 people were here at the house within the few days leading up to the bug being found. My cousin and a friend we paid to watch my grandpa for a few hours. 

When I told my friend about the bug, he immediately went checking his and his roommates mattresses for signs. He checked his couch and his clothes and he did all his laundry just to see if anything would pop up. Nothing at all.
When it was mentioned to my cousin, he refused to even check and said he didn't have them. He's always itchy and covered in bug bites the few times I've seen him. He claims it's mosquitos, and maybe it is, but him being unwilling to even check made me severely uncomfortable.

Today grandma was making plans to have him come over. I told her she can't have him in the house and she lost it at me. Screaming about how I'm ruining everyone's lives with these bug worries and calling me stupid as she ran up the stairs. She said ""MY LIFE IS REDUCED TO THIS"" and ""YOU ARE ACCUSING HIM OF SOMETHING"" 
She went to see him anyway and wouldn't change her clothes so I could wash them once she got back. I heard her mocking me too. 

I understand how maybe I wasn't being the nicest, but bedbugs are traumatizing and she isn't good at spotting any kind of vermin to even notice any potential signs.

Me (18) and my girlfriend (19) have been dating for about 2 years now. We have something close to what people say a ""perfect relationship"" however not every relationship is perfect. We still have the occasional healthy argument here and then. We're both really supportive of each other... sometimes. However both of us can be quite stubborn which leads to a lot of issues. Recently I told her I did not want her attending a pool party.

 It's a Staff pool party (I'm a lifeguard) and she went to the last one. However during that last pool party, she wanted me to pick her up since I invited her. Unfortunately it's a 5 minute drive to her house and back... and I didn't really wanna just leave my friends. 

She got mad and said ""you see them every day at work. Why can't you just pick me up. I'm you're girlfriend. It's five minutes""

 she managed to get her friend to drive her there, and after that I kinda avoided her I obviously said Hi and all that, but I already told her before hand I wanted to hang out with my friends. She seemed completely fine with it she even  joined in on some games, which was cool until the end of the night when everyone was leaving.

 She asked if I wanted to get food with her, but me and the boys wanted to play another round of water polo. She got mad and said I was inconsiderate and selfish. I told her it's alright to be selfish and that's it's not okay to be selfless 24/7 In a relationship. It's bad for your mental health. 

Anyways fast forward a couple months to Now...

My brother invited her to the party, cuz me and him work at the same place. I told him I don't want her there because I don't want to feel the stress of needing to entertain her. The stress of feeling like I'm not doing good enough for her to stay content. 

I try and hang out with her during it but she doesn't seem interested. She's the type to always make sure I'm feeling good or having fun when we go out in places.  I don't want her to feel like crap when all I really wanna do is focus on my friends. Tbh it's her fault for not liking the same things they do especially at this party.  I think she should just be able to sit out and still enjoy it or at least don't come at all. She said she doesn't want me to spend the whole time with her, but to at least check up on her and say hi since I invited her. Anyways I told her to didn't want her coming to this one even though my brother invited her, and she got mad and called me selfish, considerate, and unwilling to compromise.

23,1ehu4vv,AITA for giving my brother my honest opinion when he asked for my opinion on his new girlfriend?,"My brother “Ty” M27 recently began dating a girl “Jo” F28. I was initially surprised that he chose to date her, because she wasn’t his usual type. Jo is average looking–short and overweight with pasty skin (and she doesn’t workout or go outside much), whereas most of Ty’s previous girlfriends have been slim and fit, and shared his love of fitness and the outdoors. I thought maybe Jo was a trust fund baby for something, but she’s from a normal family and sells insurance. I wondered if Ty just wanted a break from dating and wanted someone casual who would split the bill, be okay with Chinese takeout instead of five course meals, etc, but no–Ty still spends hundreds of dollars on Jo on a regular basis. So then I thought maybe Jo is really fun and interesting and has a great personality, but I was wrong about that too.

Two months into dating and Jo started to change everything about Ty. He visited me one day wearing a button up and khakis instead of his normal T-shirt and basketball shorts. I asked why the change in style and he said Jo didn’t like him to wear those clothes in public, and told him to change his wardrobe. I asked if Jo PAID for the new clothes and he said no, he paid for all of it. When I visited Ty’s house, there was construction going on in the front lawn. I asked Ty what of it and he said Jo made him change the landscaping bc it was tacky. Again, Ty paid for this himself. Ty is chill, and he makes a lot of money, so he probably didn’t realize just how controlling Jo was, but she was slowly beginning to change his style, his house, his hair, even the food he ate.

I was planning on staying out of it because Ty is capable of making his own decisions, but a few days ago he asked me what I thought of Jo. He said he was considering having her move in and wanted to know if I thought he should take things to the next level. I told him no, point blank. I told him that he was too blind to see Jo was literally trying to change everything about him and force him to fund these changes with his own money. Ty was somewhat receptive to me when I explained what Jo was doing. I went on to tell him he’s dated way hotter girls than Jo, and that he shouldn’t let Jo of all people try to control him when he could have a swimsuit model control him.

This turned him against me and he stopped listening to everything else I had to say. He called me shallow and said the REAL reason I didn’t like Jo is because of her appearance. I tried to convince him that wasn’t true, but he wouldn’t have it. I spoke to my mom later and she agrees with me that Jo is too controlling, but that it was inappropriate for me to go after her looks when there are way worse things about her. My dad agrees with me to a T, but some of my younger, woker friends think there’s absolutely nothing wrong with Jo–she’s just doing what the vast majority of men in heterosexual relationships do.

24,1ehttpq,AITA for booking a different flight than my girlfriend? ,"My girlfriend and I were planning a trip from our home on the west coast to our hometown on the east coast for a week before heading to Europe on vacation. I thought about booking a different flight home than her, which caused a little fight.

Story: We booked our flights about three weeks ago. Due to work travel after our trip, she was booking a one-way ticket while I was booking a round-trip. She booked her flight a week before I did because her schedule was set, while I waited because I wasn’t sure what mine looked like. She’s a dietitian and had client calls scheduled for the afternoon of our travel day to the east coast, so she wanted to take the calls from home instead of rescheduling them, which I understand. 

However, the cheapest one-way flight that fit her schedule was an overnight red-eye. I haaaate red-eye flights and try to avoid them whenever possible. Since I had a lot more flexibility that day, I had the option to take a flight that was both $50 cheaper and during the day.

I told her I was going to book that one, and she got really upset because she was excited for us to travel together and wanted to sit next to me. She also felt annoyed because she had booked her flight earlier, and I knew her plans in advance. We hadn’t agreed that we would be on the same flight, but I think she just assumed I would book the same flight.

 I felt bad and realized maybe it was better to be a good boyfriend than have a nice flight, so I ended up paying the extra money for the overnight flight. However, I’m dreading the red-eye and wish I had chosen the day flight after all. I understand that the considerate thing to do was to join her on her flight, but the flight I wanted to book was cheaper, more convenient, and way way wayyy better than a red eye. I figured it would be okay to fly separately for this leg because we’re flying internationally for vacation next week and we’ll have hours and hours to sit next to each other on the plane.

So what’s the verdict. Am I the asshole for considering booking a different flight than hers?

TL;DR: Girlfriend and I flying to visit home. She could only take a red eye, but there was a flight that was during that day that was $50 cheaper and much better for my schedule.

My little sister Sarah (F13) has surgery scheduled for  next week meaning her and my parents will be out of town for AT LEAST 2 days, I attend an autism support group and as it's summer they've started doing weekly day trips rather than having the actual club, one of these trips falls on the same day as Sarah's surgery and of course this means that i won't be able to attend as I'll need to be home to care for my younger brother Lee (M4) whilst my parents are away, because im missing out on the trip my mum suggested that invite my best friend Lucy (F20) over which I think is a good idea as it'll keep my mind off the surgery.

I was talking to another friend about the plans and that I was excited because it's been YEARS since I've been able to invite someone over and have them stay the night, I mentioned that we'd probably just take over the living room, have a few drinks and watch a few movies, this friend said that its a bit of an asshole move to have someone over for drinks whilst my sister's in hospital and im babysitting.

29,1ehsr5z,AITA scaring my daughter and not refunding her shoes?,"Throwaway for privacy. I am just worried about my daughters safety but wondering if I went too far like my wife is saying.

I (52M) have a daughter Elisa (23F) with my wife Sarah (50F). Elisa has always like to run. She used to be part of a running club in college and moved onto running for her university. We are very proud of all of her achievements surrounding the sport. Typically she runs on the streets, always somewhere clearly lit and where people are around. 

I noticed last week that Elisa has started getting into trail running. She has a pair of trainers with studs now which are muddy and no longer new. She left them on the doormat. In my opinion, trail running is a lot less safe compared to road running. She could be followed home, she could run into trouble and become unreachable, she could get injured with no way to call us - she does not bring her phone on her runs and just uses her watch (which I also think is very dangerous but that's a conversation we've already had).

I held my tongue about it because if she enjoys it, I should support her and I also understand why people may prefer the trails to road running. However, I had a look at the routes she'd planned on Strava and they seem to be further away than I'm comfortable with and not on popular routes. I let her know how I feel and emphasised it's about who she could run into while running and god knows what could happen.

Today, she asked me for the money back for her new shoes because she said I'd scared her. She said she knows I'm looking out for her but can't unhear what I said. She does not want to trail run any more and she can't return her shoes because they're used. I refused to give her the money back mainly because I don't see how it's my fault if she has decided not to pursue this hobby. I was just letting her know that trail running can be dangerous.

I asked her if she was upset with me a couple different times and she said no, but her body language tells a very different story.  Ironically she is the main reason I’m doing this, as I typically had a decent handle on coping mechanisms until we met, but I didn’t want to sacrifice the relationship just to carry on living as I did before.",0.0,1.0416260957717896,1,0
32,1ehsecx,AITA for wanting to claim POA and have changes made to my grandmother’s will?,"This is my first time doing one of these so I apologize if this isn’t up to par with the format of AITA posts. 

But to start things off, I (28M) have been living with my grandmother (now 80) for the better part of the last 4 years. After a medical scare (likely a result due to her catching Covid-19 during the pandemic) she has never quite been the same since and it has caused an immense amount of stress on my family, and more directly, myself and I want to force some changes to her will as I feel I am going to be entirely wronged in what is deserved.

So let me provide some context:

I was raised by my grandparents (mother’s side) and it was through them that I’ve learned most of my morals, behaviors, and outlook on the world. They were both immensely kind individuals, and despite being devout Catholics and more right leaning politically they both respected and treated or viewed everyone equally and were immensely progressive as well despite this having advocated for the rights and fair treatment of LGBTQ+ individuals, as well as those with differing religious or political views and never once would say anything negative about someone even if they were directly wronged. (My grandfather quite literally was mugged at gunpoint when I was a child and still managed to sum it up to “Everyone has their reasons, I cannot imagine how tough his life is that he was driven to such an act and I hope he finds help.”

The first shift changed when I was in middle school and my grandfather passed from late stage cancer. He fought hard but this was sadly just before a lot of medical breakthroughs which would have otherwise saved him. It hit all of us hard, especially my grandmother, my mother, and two uncles. But my grandmother wasn’t ever quite the same, she became a bit more reserved and didn’t go out as much as she used to, and that pattern remained until I moved out after graduating high school. 

I lived on my own for roughly 8 or so years, finding my own path in life. A good job, and ultimately finding someone I was going to marry the American dream right? Life was going well until the pandemic hit however; the company I worked for went bankrupt and the quarantine changed my now ex into someone I no longer recognized and it drove me to the point that everything went to shit. I lost the house we had bought together, her love, and a stable source of well paying income.

It was also at this time that my grandmother had a scare with a run in with Covid as well (now late 2021). From here everything about her seemed to change; she became bitter, angry, and her memory started to slip more and more with each passing year. She has developed a severe case of OCD; nothing can be moved out of a place where she wants it to be, this includes my home office stuff, clothes, and even in some cases, important documents or tools needed for work (I am now in IT working a hybrid/remote job as a service tech) or stuff like shoes or my car keys.

The kindness in her has faded entirely and almost every conversation with her now become a chore as I hear the same demeaning, derogatory, and borderline racist, homophobic, or just ass backward rant roughly 6 or so times a day. Because of all of this watching her, taking care of her, the house, bills, groceries, etc involves so much effort on top of working a standard 9-5. 

It is also important to note that, despite my mother and two uncles and their families living in the area (within an hour of where we live) none of them help even the slightest with taking care of her, and none of us can morally bring ourselves to put her in an elder care facility. 

About a month ago somehow the conversation arose between my grandmother and I on her deciding and finalizing her will; she had had a friend take her while I was away at work to have it written out, which is to where I have learned that almost all of her assets (house, belongings, money) will go to my mother and uncles, and save for some photo albums of pictures when I was a baby / kid I get nothing unless deemed otherwise by my family. 

I feel betrayed, wronged, and a part of me wants to disappear and start a new life and leave my grandmother to her own devices and for my family to figure it out taking care of her themselves. I don’t have a relationship with my parents and my own siblings and I talk but wouldn’t say there’s any connections there either so I’d have no ties keeping me here otherwise. I’ve read a bit here and there and have consulted with a few friends who work in law on possible options and one of them mentioned that a power of attorney move may be necessary for you to have some of the will amended or a codicil written that would at the very least allow me to have a more “equal” inheritance. I’m just unsure if it is the right thing to do here or if it makes me the asshole for wanting to change something as “sacred” as one’s will.

33,1ehsam0,AITA for leaving a theater play 2 days before the premiere?,"I (23M) was invited to play the narrator for Rocky Horror Show around two months ago, it was really not that complicated because the narrator only interacts with the other characters around 2 or 3 times through the show, I accepted the invitation and started going to the rehearsals even when I was taking a break from musical theater as I don't live near the city (Around two/two and a half hours away).

When I started going everything was fine, and to be honest, even tho I am not really an extroverted person I didn't had much trouble, I learned my lines and was really enjoying the character and all the jokes it has, and how it interacts with the public, also the play was really funny and I really enjoyed watching the other actors play their parts, everything was going well until the last rehearsal.

The first thing it's honestly kind of petty but it still kind of hurt, when we were rehearsing the curtain call, my character was sent to the back line, I am the only speaking character in there, it felt weird, considering that the narrator appears all through the show and interacts a lot with the public, but I could live with it.

The second and important one was that one week before the premiere, I was announced that there would be another narrator  (that never went to the rehearsals) and that I was going to be only on the early morning shows, and I don't know how it is in other places but here that usually means the play where the least amount of people go, is more like a friends and family kind of play (Especially since this isn't a paid gig, is more for the love of it).

It was weird that they told me this really important information just one week before, a lot of people that were going to see me can't go in the morning and when I told them about the change, they told me they could no longer go, which felt like shit.

I tried to talk it with them and explain why I was leaving to see if this could be fixed, just to get greeted with passive aggressive comments (Kinda understandable), it just felt awful that after two months of going to the rehearsals while I had to a lot of college stuff I was still giving a lot of time to the project only to be replaced last minute, I would've accepted and be cool with it if we had the plays better distributed but it wasn't the case.

So now I don't have a role and I feel like crap from leaving the play like that, my friends and family are telling me that I did the right thing and that I need to have some respect for myself as what they did was a really duchy thing to do at the very last moment, but I still feel really guilty even tho it doesn't really changes things that much for they as they can just put the actor in all the plays ¿AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-01,"AITA for leaving a theater play 2 days before the premiere?

35,1ehs3za,AITA for going to my surgery alone? ,"
I (f23) had a fall 2 weeks ago, broke my foot and found out I need surgery for it. 

My mom(f45) has been planning a big anniversary party and i have been helping her plan it. Sometimes she asks me to come along on errands for the party even though I’m supposed to be resting at home. She’s mindful of it however and will park closer to the buildings and look for places for me to sit if I get tired of being on crutches so it’s not too bad. But for sure I’d rather be at home. 

She also decided she wanted to lose weight for the party and has been dieting and recently got prescribed Ozempic. I’m very mindful of my weight and what I eat so she comes to me for advice. I was scared of the Oz and let her know. The Oz was on back order, so she started calling different pharmacies to see who had it in stock. I sat with her while she was on the phone and she finally found a pharmacy that had it in stock. the pharmacist told her he’d call her back when she could pick it up. I was happy for her but feeling pretty tired so I decided to lay down to take a nap. 

I fell asleep and she came into my room screaming and hyperventilating so I asked what was wrong. She told me the Oz was ready for pickup so when I found out it wasn’t an emergency I turned over to go back to bed. She asked if I wanted to go with her and I said no. 

She came in a few minutes later and was squealing about how excited she was and came to my bed to hug and squeeze me and kiss me. It was fine at first but then I was getting annoyed because she got really aggressive with the affection and I told her to stop but she wasn’t listening. After a while I started to get upset and raised my voice at her. She said she’d stop if I gave her a kiss and I told her I didn’t want to. She was insistent on it but by that point I was beyond pissed I told her to leave me alone and her tone changed. She walked out of my room, and came back in to tell me “don’t forget that you need me, I don’t need you” 

While she was out, the dr called and told me surgery was scheduled two days from then. I called my mom to tell her and she said “good for you” and hung up.

The next day I woke up to messages from her asking for help with a vendor so I went to her room and she was rude to me and brushed me off.

The next day I get a text from her sister asking for surgery info (location and time) So my mom told her sister about it and is trying to extract information from me through her.

Today (one day before surgery) my mom texted me and asked me what hospital the surgery was at and I texted back saying “no need to worry about it” all she said was “you are so immature”

I plan on going to the surgery alone and leaving the planning and weight loss to my mom.

37,1ehrxfr,AITA for Sharing a Drawing of Eeyore in My Farewell Message at Work?,"So, the title might make me sound innocent enough, but let me give you the full context before you decide.

A while back, my workplace was going through a particularly stressful period. Everyone was on edge, morale was low, and the tension was palpable. In an effort to lift everyone’s spirits, I came up with a light-hearted idea: a quiz to match each of our team members to a character from Winnie the Pooh. The idea was that everyone could anonymously vote on who they thought would be the best fit for each character—like who would be our Christopher Robin, who would be Winnie the Pooh, and so on.

To my relief, the plan worked like a charm. The quiz brought some much-needed levity to the team, and people seemed to genuinely enjoy it. I left the quiz open for a day to give everyone a chance to participate, and the next day, I published the results in our group chat. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive; it felt like everyone appreciated the fun distraction.

Right after that, I took a week off work. During that time, I was actively job hunting and ended up securing a new position. When I returned to work, I handed in my notice.

A few days later, I was unexpectedly called into a meeting with HR. To my surprise, I was informed that one of my colleagues was deeply upset about being voted as Eeyore. She had reportedly told HR that during a previous training session, we had discussed Winnie the Pooh characters as metaphors for mental health. Although I don’t recall having this conversation with her—especially since I didn’t attend many training sessions with her—I was now being accused of making a thoughtless, hurtful association.

HR then told me that they were considering disciplinary action against me. However, because I had already resigned, they decided not to pursue it. But they made it clear that if I chose to retract my resignation, they would proceed with the disciplinary process.

Fast forward to my last day at the company. At 8:43 a.m., I posted a heartfelt goodbye message in our team Slack channel, expressing how much I’d miss everyone. I also mentioned that my 15-year-old stepchild had drawn a picture of Eeyore, which I included as a parting gift for my colleague. To me, it was a thoughtful gesture; the drawing was beautifully done, and I thought it would be a nice touch.

But less than an hour later, at 9:20 a.m., I was called into another meeting. Apparently, someone had filed a complaint about the Eeyore drawing, deeming it ""inappropriate and insensitive."" The situation escalated quickly, and I was promptly escorted from the building.

Now, Reddit, I’m left wondering: Was I really that out of line? AITA for sharing that drawing of Eeyore in my farewell message, or was this an overreaction on their part?

38,1ehrgn3,AITA? Tattoo artist changed price on me after 2 sessions,"For background, I am also a tattoo artist. The artist who’s doing my backpiece and I have both been tattooing for a year, I did a formal apprenticeship and she is self taught. We agreed upon $500 for the piece she is doing on my back, $250 hopefully split into 2 sessions. It is so cheap bc it is her first backpiece and I assumed it was kind of a portfolio piece for her. I did my second session with her last night and she had a lot of trouble reprinting/putting on the stencil again so not a lot got done. She messaged me this morning saying that the piece is taking longer than expected so from here on out she’s going to have to charge me around 200 per every future session.

The artist who’s doing my backpiece and I have both been tattooing for a year, I did a formal apprenticeship and she is self taught. We agreed upon $500 for the piece she is doing on my back, $250 hopefully split into 2 sessions. It is so cheap bc it is her first backpiece and I assumed it was kind of a portfolio piece for her. I did my second session with her last night and she had a lot of trouble reprinting/putting on the stencil again so not a lot got done.

She still comes home complaining how he can spend $60 on a game but not a single cent for their anniversary gift that is now a month late (not to forget how she never got an easter gift after splurging on him). They did not get engaged yet because he wants it to be a ""surprise."" Oh, and did I mention it's a ring from temu? All her gifts so far were under a dollar on temu, but he wants her to buy him $60 hoodies.

My family has a word for my mom's bf, his sister, and his mother. We call them the loons. They act like children. The one beltches as loud as she can when eating (in public, too). She's the know-it-all, touches my mom inappropriately, and wants to ""carry their child"" since my mom can't have kids at her age.

I hated her when we met. She was confidently touching my stuff the first time she came over, taking everything off the bookshelf and coffee table. I told her to keep her hands off my stuff. I know I'm not the only one who finds it rude to have people over who touch your things without permission. My mom told me later that I was being ""mean,"" and that she was only curious. She's a grown woman btw

I think I mentioned in the last post that the mom called herself my grandma like 6 months after my actual grandma passed away. I'm still not over it.

Last post, I made it known to my mom that I would basically ghost her irl if she marries him. I still stand firm on this. At this point, the entire Loony family knows I despise them and am against the relationship. I don't feel safe near my mom's bf and told her never to let him be alone near me cause he stares at me and is twice my size.

She also didn't raise a liar, and saying I like them while my actions prove otherwise would be a lie. I believe it is better to be open and honest so there's no miscommunication.

I agree to the extent that I may be a bit too aggressively outright by saying I will not ever see them as family and similar remarks being rude. I don't feel like TA for hating them, nor do I feel like I should accept them just for my mom's sake. The only thing I can agree with is I may be TA is that I do say some things that could be phrased better.

We both put together lists of needs, wants, and deal-breakers for our desired home.  We both had similar lists in terms of needs and wants.  Multiple bedrooms and good schools for when we have kids, fenced in yard for our dog, no major renovations needed, etc.  I only had one real deal-breaker.  I told her I would refuse to even put an offer in on a house that has an HOA.

My parents lived in an HOA when I was a teenager and I saw the amount of BS they had to go through all the time.  There's no way I want to spend a huge amount of money and have to deal with that kind of thing for who knows how many years.  The house could check every single box in our need and want list and I would still refuse to even try and buy it.  

Well, our search has not been an easy one.  We have been priced out of a lot of areas that we were hoping to live in.  And the houses that are more within our budget are not exactly what we're looking for.  We've toured dozens of houses.  Had offers rejected.  Had sellers try to get us into bidding wars.  We've argued, disagreed, and fought.  It's sucked.  

Last week our realtor sent us a home that was just hitting the market.  She was excited because she thought it was ""exactly what we are looking for.""  My wife fell in love with the pictures and wanted to set up a tour.  But as I was looking at the listing, I saw it has an HOA.

She decided to set up a tour with the realtor without me.  She viewed the home without telling me about it, then came home and was all excited to submit an offer.  She spent an entire evening trying to convince me that it's her ""dream house"" and that we need to submit an offer before it's too late.  She said there's no harm in submitting an offer just to see what the sellers say.

I told her that she knows an HOA is my #1 deal-breaker and that I find it pretty upsetting that she would go behind my back and do this on her own and then try and convince me to compromise my stance.  She tried to downplay how much of an impact an HOA would have on our lives and told me that ""a little inconvenience from an HOA won't offset how much we enjoy our home.""  

But she's never lived in an HOA.  She hasn't seen first-hand how nuts they can be and how stressful it can be for a homeowner.  I reminded her that when we started looking, that we both agreed that this had to be a 2-yes decision.  Meaning that if one of us vetoed a house for whatever reason, we wouldn't pursue it.  And she knows that an HOA is my #1 veto reason.  

She's now super pissed at me for vetoing her ""dream house.""

45,1ehqdu9,AITA Because I had to get a ride to a job?,"Okay so I never really posted like this on Reddit so excuse me if I have poor formatting

For about 2 months now I've been trying to find a sustainable job that pays somewhat normally, and I just keep having no luck even though I have a vocational degree in Culinary, Pro-Start and Baking.

My Dad has been telling me to dedicate myself further but I literally spend a majority of days looking through job boards, reaching out on Facebook to old friends, and trying interviews just to get a bite.

So a few days ago I told my Dad I had an interview Tuesday at 3 and one Friday at 1 at different spots, he wanted to take my car to work because my sister was celebrating her 21st birthday by getting wasted at her boyfriend's house and said she'd take me there.

Anyway so then it's Tuesday and I'm starting to get anxious because my sister still wasn't home yet, but thankfully she got here at 12:30ish but then she asked me why I wasn't ready yet, and I told her that my interview was at 3, not 1; She tried arguing with me about how my Dad said otherwise and I said he probably just got details wrong.

So then she storms out of the house and leaves again until it's 2, then we leave and I assume that it would be smooth sailing from then on, it wasn't.

She then pulled up to the wrong restaurant, the one I'd be having an interview Friday on, I tried to tell her that she was mistaken again but then that resulted in a another yelling match, but at that point she was low on oil and her car was a smart car and wouldn't let her drive off again.

She then got teary eyed and shouted at me, screaming at me to walk home as she just beat up her steering wheel. I then walked to the hospital where my Dad worked and had to drive back to get her and take her home after she called a tow truck, but then both her and my Dad was pissed at me, my Dad later apologized and said he was just aggravated at some girl at work and took it out on me, but I still just felt fucking awful.

I felt unloved and unwanted, I was legit crying in public trying to get my shit together that day.

46,1ehq80p,AITA for being distant towards my boyfriend after he was about to leave after i asked him to wash a dirty bowl,"Me and my bf are currently together for 2,5 years. So a few weeks ago we have been together on the weekend (we only see each other on the weekend). On friday we went out to grad some food from an asian restaurant and took it home. Got home, i prepared out food and he started yelling out of the blue what the fück was wrong with the wifi. He wanted to watch some soccer that was currently playing. I asked him what the problem was and he told me really pissed that the wifi isnt working. After I looked on my phone I told him on mine it was working and that he should use his wifi flat. I was a bit shocked for his reaction for the rest of the evening.

So a few weeks ago we have been together on the weekend (we only see each other on the weekend). On friday we went out to grad some food from an asian restaurant and took it home. Got home, i prepared out food and he started yelling out of the blue what the fück was wrong with the wifi. He wanted to watch some soccer that was currently playing. I asked him what the problem was and he told me really pissed that the wifi isnt working. After I looked on my phone I told him on mine it was working and that he should use his wifi flat. I was a bit shocked for his reaction for the rest of the evening.

47,1ehpvvh,AITA for being frustrated with my (bonus) son,"Little bit of backstory, my partner and I have been together for 9 1/2 years. I have a 15 year year-old from a previous relationship. He has a soon to be  11-year-old from a previous relationship - and I hate myself for getting frustrated with him a lot of the time. 

For the most part he’s a super sweet kid and we get along well. He has RAGING, mostly unmedicated ADHD (only on school days and only half a dose). It’s led to some significant learning disabilities and difficult relationships with other children. He’s often bullied for being ‘weird’ and acting like a baby. 

I disagree with how his father and biological mother handle his ADHD and the fact that he’s not in therapy and the fact that when anything gets slightly tough, he’s allowed to sit in front of a screen at his iPad, his Nintendo or the TV and suck on his childhood blanket like a pacifier. 

I don’t feel that he’s learning appropriate coping skills and his ADHD is constantly used as an excuse for his poor behavior.

With it being summer vacation, he’s home constantly and either acting like a wild 5 year old or glued to a screen either way his binky.  It’s EXHAUSTING dealing with it and tiptoeing around his behavior. 

My older son is just as frustrated but has a good friend base and is pretty much always off riding his bike fishing or playing sports.

I was supposed to babysit for her that Monday and the Friday before the concert(concert was on Saturday night) , but she canceled on me both times Monday was because her car broke down and Friday it was bc her bank account was ""drained"" as she said,

   this part is on me for not communicating sooner but I told her Friday during the day I had a family get together that Sunday and asked what time they'd be getting home because I'd like to be done watching them at 3 which she agreed to, the concert venue was about 3 and half hours away, they were staying at a hotel with a check out at 10:30 am so that should've been more then enough time,

   so I got to their house at about 8:30 Saturday morning, we had talked about paying me the $300 on cash app because I didnt have Venmo downloaded but they didn't have the Venmo logged in and asked if they could pay me when they got back(my mistake for agreeing) they loaded up the car to leave they told the rules and their routines and that stuff (this is the first time I've met her kids) Stacy had 3 kids under 5, everything is going okay with the kids I had a moment around lunch time where I got overwhelmed and had to step into the kitchen and talked to my mutal friend and Stacy only checked in with me maybe 3 times

   jump to Sunday morning I wake up at around 6 am after I barely slept, I don't hear from Stacy that morning untill around 11 am saying they woke up late and are leaving soon which is understandable, seems normal until I don't hear from her untill around 12:30 saying they're eating breakfast then will be on the road but they also have to drop a friend off 35 minutes the opposite direction so there's another hour added to the drive meaning rhey wouldn't be home untill 4:30 to five, when we had agreed 3 pm 2 days prior so i texted her as professional as possible saying I need to compensate for my extra time or someone need to be there by 3:30, then she snapped on me calling me crazy and wack for asking for more money, I was going only ask for like $20 more or pick me up something to eat on the way home idk something for my time, this was at 1 pm now she texted me saying her friend would be there in 30 minutes, which I was confused because I could've stayed 2 hours longer, so I understand not wanting to compensate me because her friend was there but I still think I should get paid $300 because I watched her kids for 30+ hours already but what do you guys think?

51,1ehpafg,AITA for un-intentionally giving my wife body dysmorphia ,"I (29m) have been married to my wife (27f) for 3 years and had our first child 5 months ago and everything has been great until last weekend. So, once a month my wife and I travel down to my parents house for dinner with the family and its always been great, my family love my wife and they get along well. Most of all however, my younger sister (14f) really looks up to my wife as a role model, often commenting on how pretty and beautiful she is and how she wants to look like her when she's older. Now, my sister is a bit overweight and always has been since she was young but nothing too out of the ordinary. Although, as most teenage girls are, my sister is very self conscious about her body image.

Anyway, this dinner was different, we were preparing for the upcoming christening of our child. Everything had been planned bar the clothing arrangements for the event and so my wife was helping my sister look at dresses. As most 14yo girls would be, my sister was very excited for the opportunity to get all dressed up. Naturally, my mom and my wife were measuring my sister, everything was going smoothly until my wife makes a comment: ""Wow we are the same size and I've just had a baby!"". Now my wife is very petite but has maintained a lot of the baby weight so is still of a decent size. So, obviously hearing this, my sister burst into tears and ran out the room my mom gave my wife a look of disgust and chased after my sister.

At the time I was in the living room with my dad, only when I heard the crying did I go upstairs. I made my way to my sisters room to see what happened and my mom explained everything to me. Furious, I stormed into the room where my wife was and confronted her, only to be met with shock at the lack of remorse my wife was showing. She gave her detail of the story (almost identical to what my mom told me) and could not understand what she had done wrong. I explained to her my sisters poor body image and why she was out of line. My wife however, still could not see her wrongdoing. At this point I was ready to explode with anger. I told my wife that, whilst she still looks great, comparing my 14yo sisters size to her post-pregnancy body is unfair and demeaning. To my surprise, I was met with a look of confusion. ""What do you mean post-pregnancy body?"" My wife questioned. I explained to my wife that she still looked beautiful and it was perfectly normal,  she did carry some of the weight from her pregnancy.

My wife too burst into tears, shouting, ""How can you call me fat when I carried your child for 9 months!?"" she followed this by immediately storming out of the house and getting in the car home. Having explained what happened to my mom she appreciated me trying to defend my sister but slated me for ""body-shaming"" my wife.

In the last couple of days, my wife has been crying, sleeping in a separate room to me, and deleting recent posts. All her friends have taken her side demanding I apologise for what I said.

53,1ehoku9,AITA for telling my best friend that I'm feeling excluded by him?,"I (22m) have been part of the same circle of friends since school. We've weathered a lot of storms together, including a big split in the group recently where we split into two. Since then, I'd been feeling really good about the situation, and optimistic for the future.

Things have started to take a bit of a weird turn, though. My best friend, Steve (22m), is someone I care very deeply about. We both moved away to the same uni (on different courses), and came back to the aforementioned group split. We've almost always been on the same page. He's had a difficult start to the year, and I've done my best to be there for him, even during a very turbulent time in my life as well. Recently, though, he's started feeling a bit distant and cold with me though, in a way I can't quite shake.

There have been a few plans now where I've thought I've been invited, and been getting hyped up or ready to go when I've been told by Steve on short notice I'm not invited. I'm fine with this in principle, because our group has a bunch of little sub-groups where we all do different things. This one was a big festival, so I said I'd go on my own and just explore. Steve lashed out at me for this, saying I was being selfish and making things awkward for him. I didn't actually end up bumping into them during the festival because it was super busy, but I could see why he'd be on edge.

A few weeks later, Steve gave me a list of things that he'd said hurt him. Most of them were things I'd not been aware of, but the TLDR is I've been a bit reckless and had loose lips, which I've owned up to and taken accountability for. It was clear that these things been bubbling within Steve for some time, and there was some resentment there, even after I apologised and committed to improving. I had a really emotional breakdown where I told him why I'd not been feeling like myself lately, and we had a really productive and nice conversation after that.

Now a similar sub-group outing has happened, which again is fine, but I was having a conversation with the group about it (not knowing that it was an exclusive event), and the next day received a lengthy message from Steve saying that none of them wanted to tell me about it because they were worried I'd go off the rails. I let him know that it's only the conversations that are clearly taking place behind my back that hurt me. My previous best friend turned out to be a manipulative sociopath, so I apologised to Steve for being a bit on edge during what's clearly been a tense couple of months between us, and admitted to being scared. He told me to grow up and that nobody could trust me to control my emotions, then apologised for being snappy.

Considering I've been going to therapy over my anxiety and really making progress with myself, the recent comments from Steve felt a bit out of the blue. 2024's been a rocky year for me, but I'm worried that I've been too focused on my own journey and not taken stock of my friends as much as I should have.

I had a really emotional breakdown where I told him why I'd not been feeling like myself lately, and we had a really productive and nice conversation after that.

Now a similar sub-group outing has happened, which again is fine, but I was having a conversation with the group about it (not knowing that it was an exclusive event), and the next day received a lengthy message from Steve saying that none of them wanted to tell me about it because they were worried I'd go off the rails. I let him know that it's only the conversations that are clearly taking place behind my back that hurt me. My previous best friend turned out to be a manipulative sociopath, so I apologised to Steve for being a bit on edge during what's clearly been a tense couple of months between us, and admitted to being scared. He told me to grow up and that nobody could trust me to control my emotions, then apologised for being snappy.

Considering I've been going to therapy over my anxiety and really making progress with myself, the recent comments from Steve felt a bit out of the blue. 2024's been a rocky year for me, but I'm worried that I've been too focused on my own journey and not taken stock of my friends as much as I should have.

54,1ehogqh,AITA For Refusing To Schedule A Surgery For My Niece?,"I'm going to keep this one short.

My wife's sister is currently living with us due too financial trouble, and she has a kid (she's a single mom) who needs surgery on her spine.

I own a surgery center that specializes in that type of surgery, so my SIL asked me if I can set something up for her. The only problem with that, is because since she doesn't make a lot of money, she uses public health insurance instead of private. None of my surgeons take Medicaid/Medicare patients due to reimbursements.

When I told my SIL about that, I offered to help her find somewhere else (she doesn't want to do the surgery at our local hospital for some reason) and she started to spout bullshit about how their work ethic is ""wrong,"" (Which it isn't) and that it's corrupt.

Anyways, she told my wife about that, and now she's trying to persuade me to find someone to perform the surgery at my place (Which is weird, because if they don't want to do the surgery they don't really have to), so I'm asking here to see if I'm the asshole.

My SIL thinks I am, and she's done a pretty good job having my wife try to persuade me over it.

UPDATE: (Is this the appropriate place?)

So, me and my SIL spent a good chunk of time looking for surgeons, and we found a pediatric spine surgeon for her that accepted their insurance. We have scheduled, gotten codes, and checked how much insurance would cover. I'm probably going to pay the deductible for the surgery, and yeah we'll see how it does from here. Scheduled for about 2-3 weeks from now.  Nothing too insane compared to some of these. ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-01,"AITA For Refusing To Schedule A Surgery For My Niece?

My husband and I have been together for nearly a decade and he's extremely close to his family. Pretty much holds them at a higher level than me, his wife. His sister has always been a problem and no one cares to put her in her place. She's in her 30's and extremely immature due to the company she keeps. 

When we got married a few years ago, I chose to include her as a bridesmaid because I wanted to have a bond with her and what a s\* show that was. The entire time we were getting ready, she was in/out the room with her THEN boyfriend making jokes and just goofying off. When it was time to take pictures, she opted out because her ""corset was too tight and she was going to pass out\*. My other bridesmaid and I were more than willing to shoo her away because we we're over it. 

Fast forward, a few years, my husband and I are expecting a baby. When we announced it, my SIL snatched the ultrasound photo, took a picture of it and sent it to her NOW boyfriend saying ""LOL i have a surprise"" I was LIVID because, A. you're too grown to act like this B. stop making it about you and C. my husband didn't say anything to her, just chuckled and kept on with the day.

It's time for my maternity pictures and I asked her to please not post anything on her socials (she does part time photography and snapped our photos) She agreed and my husband reiterated that to her. I then come to find out she posted them on Pinterest. Without letting us know anything. Again, my husband doesn't say anything to her.

65,1ehmstf,AITA for liking an insta post,"This is super nitpicky and I (f19) am genuinely unsure of how to assess the situation.

For context: 
There is an art account on instagram (maybe on TikTok too, I am not entirely sure) that takes videos of people that act really cringey or obnoxious and they parodize them by drawing really extreme charicatures of them while pausing the videos. One of the videos was about a girl sitting down in the middle of an airport filming herself whith the caption ""PoV: I am everyone's airport crush"" (something among the lines). 
The girl is really cute, it's just an obnoxious thing to post and I find it a bit embarrassing.

Anyways my sister (23) walks in 2 minutes ago asking, quote:  ""You are like a person that hates making fun of people's appearances, right? Like, you always correct people when they do that?""
To which I agreed, because when someone does that in real life, I shit on them making negative or assumptious remarks about other's appearances instead of just keeping it to themselves. I genuinely dislike that sort of thing.

Then she goes on telling me she saw that I liked the ig post and thinks it's hypocritical of me to find it funny/like it.
I go on to explain that I find merely the charicature drawing funny and that it satirizes the girl's behavior, I didn't think anything about her appearance at all. The girl is quite cute and I don't care about how she chooses to present herself.
I never commented on the post either, I just liked it.
Now she is judging me for ""not letting her just do what she wants"", even tho I never said she couldn't make the video or write the caption, i just found it funny, I didn't think too much about any of it in the first place.
I feel like something was overstepped by her and I really dislike her immediately scrutinizing my insta activity and then making assumptions about my intentions. My sister accused me out of the blue and I don't even know where that was coming from. It's however nagging at me and I don't want to turn my back on my values in that way.

66,1ehmrhi,AITAH for not trying to mediate the awful relationship between my wife and my parents?,"Hello everyone,

I am a 26-year-old man married to a 25-year-old Russian woman, and we have a 5-month-old son. Four years ago, I moved to Moscow to be with my wife, who has a small family consisting of her mother and 12-year-old sister. They are not close with other relatives and lost their father five years ago.

My wife's relationship with my parents has always been difficult, especially during her pregnancy due to lack of communication and attention. My parents would sporadically text but lacked depth. They showed little interest in her pregnancy during video calls, making her feel neglected. Despite this, they send money and care packages with European foods and financial contributions for our apartment.

Cultural and mindset differences between Russia and the West have made it difficult for my parents to adapt, insisting that I remain true to my European roots. However, they struggle to articulate what specific values they are referring to, simply stating that Europeans and Russians think and act differently. I remind them that I am currently in Russia and must adjust accordingly to fit in at work and in daily life.

After our son's birth, my parents wanted to visit us in Moscow, but my wife felt she wasn't quite ready because she was exhausted, nursing (we decided to breastfeed instead of using formula), and she would rather have my parents over when she was more recovered and used to having a baby around at home. Despite her hesitation, my parents eventually visited when our son was around 2 months old. There was some reluctance on my wife's part, though. I suppose my parents had great hopes because they had to pay a large sum of money to get to Russia.

My parents were invited to my wife's mother's home. A huge variety of dishes were prepared to welcome them. While my wife mostly held our child during the meal, my parents felt left out and upset as they were not offered the opportunity to bond with their grandchild. Despite this, they did not take the initiative to ask to hold him themselves.

A few days later, my wife took our son to get vaccinated. When she returned, she was instructed not to receive visitors for 1 day or take our child outside for a walk. This meant my parents couldn't visit, which angered them. They accused my wife of preventing them from seeing their grandchild, leading to a rift between them. I couldn't mediate as both parties were livid. Upon asking my Russian friends and colleagues, I learned that it's common in Russia to avoid visitors for 1 day after a child's vaccination due to the increased risk of getting infected easily, especially in a huge city like Moscow.

To this day, my wife and parents still cannot communicate properly. My parents send weekly texts to my wife asking about our son, but she responds slowly and never texts them first. My wife would occasionally, in the middle of an argument or disagreement between us, make a contemptuous reference to my parents and our ""European values.""",Asshole,2024-08-01,"AITAH for not trying to mediate the awful relationship between my wife and my parents?

He went on a holiday twice not long ago and didn't pay me back for all the food I spent on his cat, I didn't want to pressure him so I said it's ok and he didn't need to pay me back.

77,1ehlbv1,AITAH for accidentally stealing my best friend's potential future baby name?,"Hello, thank you for reading and thank you for sharing your judgements of my situation!

My best friend and I have been friends for about 10 years. Over the years, like with all relationships, issues have come up but we have been able to talk through them. But I think this one has ended our friendship.

In the past we have talked about our futures and what we want for ourselves, and she used to express wanting a son and naming him Franklin. We have had this conversation a few times, but certainly not regularly, and in recent years she has expressed maybe not wanting to ever get married or have kids.

I personally do not want children now, but maybe in the future. For now, dogs are all I need! Earlier this year, my 10 year old dog has to be put down suddenly, and it was horrible and tragic and shook my entire world. I have never felt grief like that before. Soon after, my husband and I began looking for dogs that needed homes, as our home had a void and we had lots of love to give. We found a perfect 2 year old dog that needed love and we brought him home. We went back and forth on names for weeks and could not agree. Until my husband suggested the name Frankie. Although it was not my first choice, I do like it and it fits him very well, so we named him Frankie.

Since bringing Frankie home, he has brought so much love back into our house and we are so happy to have him. But a few days after getting him, and sharing him on social media, I received a phone call from my best friend stating I stole her baby name. She reminded me she has always wanted to name her baby franklin and i should've asked her permission if I was going to use that name. Or just told my husband no when he suggested it. I'll be honest, not once throughout the whole process did she, or her potential future baby, ever cross my mind. I just didn't put two and two together. Maybe that makes me a bad friend?

When we talked about it she reminded me that she has felt I ""copy"" her for years. (when we like the same clothing brands, or wear the same color alot, or like the same hobbies). She also said she has been in lots of conversations recently with people talking pretty negatively of me, and they all agree. Which felt like a huge stab in the back. Because of this, I kind of feel like this is one of those situations where you discover your friend hates you. But I do know that people's baby names are important to them, and maybe I'm in the wrong here for not remembering hers.

This is a common even that happens where if I cannot care for my sibling when my parents are out of town that I am called selfish. 

They went to a funeral for my uncle and made me stay home to care for the house/pets/sibling and when I had “too many friends over” (I had 7 people over) my mom called a friend to sneak over to our house and check to make sure we weren’t having a “party” and I was “selfish” for even considering to have a “party” while they were out of town. 

I had to take off 4 days of work to care for pets/house/sibling while they went to a wedding for a cousin I wasn’t allowed to attend because I had to take care of everything. Thankfully I wasn’t name called for this event because I didn’t have friends over just my bf to help me/spend time with me.

He said yes. So we started planning, reserved catering, a local hall, and sent out invites. I believe he was single when he agreed to the party (his entire personality changes when he's dating someone, I only mention it because it's a pattern) July comes and I mention that my son wants to go to a local bakery for cake testing. The ex then mentions that he no longer wants a party. So I ask why. Just says he doesn't want it & would be happy with a dinner just the three of us. I'm annoyed but explain to our son that his dad changed his mind. He was a little upset since the party was his idea and his father agreed to it. He still wants to get a good cake, so I mention that I am going to order a cake for pick up and ask when he's coming over so I can pick up the cake close to his arrival. He says he's coming over on Sunday, the day after his birthday. My son gets really upset at this & I got angry. I ask him why he's canceling on his son, he shrugs and says he's going to spend the day drinking by the river or going to San Francisco. When he says that, I know there's a woman involved. So I ask him straight out if he's ditching his son for a woman. He doesn't answer. 
This is where I might be the asshole..
I texted him reminding him that he missed most of his sons life up to this point,  he doesn't spend special moments with him, and CHOOSES to see him for a couple of hours once a week. Which he changes based on his convenience. He texted back that he ""does too spend moments with him."" And I again texted that he only seems to spend time with him when he has no one else around and then listed stuff he has missed. I felt guilty afterwards Iike I should have left it alone but seeing my son upset made me angry. 

*I don't restrict access to my son, he even has a key to my house so he can visit him when I am not home. We live 15 minutes from each other but he says it's too far & inconvenient to visit our son more often.

82,1ehkoo5,WIBTA for telling my friend I feel uncomfortable about her hate for relationships?,"I've always liked the stories I see on here/other social media about AITA but it's my first post, so I'm sorry if it's messy. 

I (22F) am very good friends with Lori (21F) and have been for over a decade now. Over this decade, she's had a couple serious boyfriends and one didn't end well. I, on the other hand, entered my first serious relationship not long ago. It should be noted that me and my boyfriend didn't have a super long talking stage before dating (we just clicked and figured delaying it was no use). 

Lori's last relationship didn't end well and ever since she has gotten with guys but a lot of them are married/dating, and although I've told her my opinion on this, it's her life and she kept doing it. Then she came crying to me that she only seems to be into guys in relationships and this might make me the asshole but I didn't exactly feel bad... 

So I think that this (plus a couple talking stages that didn't work due to distance) has made her ""angry"" about love and relationships. 

As I mentioned, I got into a relationship not long ago. One time, Lori and I were talking and she said that she didn't understand long distance relationships and how they never worked. That kind of struck a nerve because although my bf and I aren't exactly long distance, we don't live super close, but whatever. On another instance,  a close friend of ours got engaged and we were commenting on how people our age are starting to get married/have kids and she told me that everyone seemed to be rushing to get into a relationship and she didn't understand why. Again, that made me feel bad because as I mentioned, bf and I got into out relationship quite quickly, but whatever.

The part that made me feel uncomfortable came 2 days ago. Lori and I were talking about future goals and prospects and she was quite sad about an opportunity she thought she had lost and I told her that everything happened for a reason. I then gave her an example and said I was meant to go to another country as an exchange student the last semester, but I didn't end up going due to some issues, and I was sad but it ended up being a good thing because if I had gone I wouldn't have met my boyfriend. To that she said ""Yeah, but you lost the chance to get with some hot italians."".

I didn't even know what to say because that was just weird and disrespectful I think, it kind of felt like she doesn't take my relationship seriously, and I felt kind of insulted that she thought I'd ever think that I ""Lost a chance"".

83,1ehkers,AITA for deciding not to return or pay for things my ex let me take from our shared apartment 7 months later?,"Hi all! Long story short I was broken up with by my ex 7 months ago. We are both 28 and queer and had been dating for 2.5 years. They insisted we stay friends after the break up and I continued to live in the apartment and pay more in rent for several months so they would have time to find a new place even though they broke up with me very suddenly. When we finally moved out they let me take the TV and an air purifier they had purchased. There were other things I had paid for that I let them keep as well, such as our couch and other household items. I have also still let them use my subscriptions and Amazon account. I also packed up thier things, helped them find a new place, helped clean the apartment and also tried to keep them in my social circle because I wanted them to have community after the breakup. 

At the time I intended to pay them back for the tv and the air purifier - but then I found out months later they were sleeping with someone who I was worried about during our relationship right after they dumped me. They then lied to my face for months about it, telling me I was paranoid, so I would keep paying more rent and help them with other household things. I then started to really unpack all the ways in which I was treated unfairly in our dynamic (although I to had contributed to this dynamic in some ways as well) I worked through a ton of my grief, have spent a lot of time in therapy this year, and has really grappled with what happened and how I was treated and also where I went wrong in the relationship. All I want now is to move on with the lessons I’ve learned. 

The ONLY thing I have asked of them is to maybe meet me at some point to process what happened so we can have closure. They said they would like that but never reached out. Fast forward to today I get a text from my ex demanding that I return the air purifier or venmo them over a hundred dollars. AITA if I just block them and move on with my life? Technically they bought it, but it tears me up inside knowing they think I will likely just give in to whatever they want.

84,1ehjv5a,AITAH for not watching my friends kids?,"So I moved to a new state a few years ago and my neighbor had a son my daughter’s age and another son my middle girl’s age. Our oldest kids were also in the same kindergarten class. We became friends and would text a good amount. It didn’t take long at all before she started asking me to watch her boys. I think it was a week or two into our friendship where she would ask me to watch them for hours. I have 3 kids of my own (they were 5,3,1 at the time, now they’re 7,5,3) and at the time we were living in a 2 bedroom second story apartment. 5 people in an apartment that small was tough, and then to add her two kids who she would ask to have them over for sleep overs. Now I didn’t mind. She’s a single mom and the first real friend I made in this new state. But it was becoming constant. Like we would never hang out, she began only texting me to watch her kids. We’d sometimes have playdate and they were nice, and she’s offered to watch my kids but I’m not comfortable leaving them where I’m not the only exception being when I had to take my youngest to the hospital and she watched my girls for 45 minutes until my husband got off of work to get them. 

So she moved and then I moved to the same place (which wasn’t planned). Her sons are nuts, as they should be for young boys. But they break things, tell my kids what to do, throw things in the house. I just can’t keep having them over. So I opted to saying no sometimes because I just can’t afford to feed them and also replace what they broke. This summer she told me she needed my help watching the boys, and I’ve been in a spiraling depression not because of this situation at all. Lots of childhood trauma is resurfacing, I’m homesick for my home state, and honestly I’m just not okay. At all. I’m looking into therapy but damn it’s expensive. So it wouldn’t be for a while. I can handle my kids just fine, but I just can’t have two other rowdy boys absolutely trashing my house. I told her my mind set and that I just can’t watch them for most of the week every week during the summer. She said it was okay and I haven’t spoken to her since. I reached out to her for a playdate but they were on vacation. She recently got back and is already asking me to watch them. And I want to help her, but I just can’t.

85,1ehjobd,AITAH for cancelling our holiday celebration last minute?,"Since some years back, I celebrate this big holiday with a group of friends. This year we got the opportunity to celebrate at a cabin in the middle of nowhere that you get to by going quite a bit by car and then boat.

This story will refer to the group, but more so to my friend Tanya. For background: the last celebration I heald was rather underwhelming and made me feel taken for granted. In addition, Tanya hasn’t really acted as a friend recently. So I wasn’t super hyped about this holiday, but still thought it would be okay.

So 6 weeks ahead, Tanya asks about the holiday and want to set the plans so (I guess) she doesn’t have to make other arrangements. I also talked to her about how off the place is, you just don’t pop by, and you bring everything you need and then some for staying a few days, since there are no shops or anything on the island or nearby. And Tanya has a car, but she also suggested asking the gruop to see if anyone else could get a car, since we were going to have a lot of luggage.

About a month ahead I send a message to the group with some info (about the same I gave Tanya), and also a print screen of the place showing how far away it is. Most of them reacted with emojis to my messages, which was fine then.

Another couple of weeks pass and I send another, “let’s get started with the planning everyone”-message with more info and some questions. They barely answer the questions,  and didn’t offer/ask to help. But I’m thinking that maybe 2 weeks is too soon for planning and let it be.

Another couple of days pass, and I still haven’t heard from anyone. But Tanya reaches out and says she hasn’t found a dog sitter (you can’t bring pets), but she’ll ask a friend. So I’m thinking it will be fine.

Another couple of days pass, and no one’s said anything. Now I’m starting to think that maybe they don’t want to go to the cabin, or maybe they don’t want to celebrate at all? But I contact Tanya, asking about the dog sitter. She says that her friend “maybe” can help her and the next thing she says is that she sold her car. So now we have no car going out there and I felt that I had had enough. I felt dissapointed, taken for granted and that no one cared about this. But almost the worst was Tanya’s nonchalant behaviour about the dog sitter and the car. 

So I felt that I could either go through with it, being bitter or resentful, or cancel. And I chose the latter. Of course there was some drama, which I was prepared for. I don’t set boundaries, so this was the first time. I feel good that I did, but it could have come sooner. But I never thought it would come to this.

She made about 8-10 comments like that about my looks and I feel like at first it was funny but after 10 comments like that it started to make me think “why can’t she just say her daughter is beautiful without comparing a side by side to me and saying she’s prettier than me specifically ”.  So the final time it happened, we were on a long drive home, and I was in the middle of a high stress driving situation and she says “someone looks a lot better than you in this photo” and I kind of misheard her and I said “ what.?” And she repeats herself and I snapped and said “can you stop with that I’m trying to drive it it’s weird and is super confusing. Obviously your baby is way cuter than me that’s a given” and she was like “why is me saying my daughter is cute confusing” and I was like you’re not calling her cute you keep weirdly comparing her to me and it got awkward. Anyways. I feel like I want to apologize but at the same time,, all of those comments were odd. ??? I will totally apologize though if I should.  I’d love some insight lol. Maybe if anything I could apologize for being grumpy?

And we’ve spent the weekend together and we’ve taken tons of photos and she keeps making comments like “one of y’all looks a lot better than the other in this photo and I think we can guess who it is” and “one of y’all is a lot cuter than the other” and so on. She made about 8-10 comments like that about my looks and I feel like at first it was funny but after 10 comments like that it started to make me think “why can’t she just say her daughter is beautiful without comparing a side by side to me and saying she’s prettier than me specifically ”.  So the final time it happened, we were on a long drive home, and I was in the middle of a high stress driving situation and she says “someone looks a lot better than you in this photo” and I kind of misheard her and I said “ what.?” And she repeats herself and I snapped and said “can you stop with that I’m trying to drive it it’s weird and is super confusing. Obviously your baby is way cuter than me that’s a given” and she was like “why is me saying my daughter is cute confusing” and I was like you’re not calling her cute you keep weirdly comparing her to me and it got awkward. Anyways. I feel like I want to apologize but at the same time,, all of those comments were odd. ??? I will totally apologize though if I should.  I’d love some insight lol. Maybe if anything I could apologize for being grumpy? 


Edit: spelling 
2nd edit:: I think I should add because there’s a lot of people commenting saying that my friend could be jealous of my looks, she is absolutely stunning. Like jaw-dropping. She could be a supermodel if she wanted to and I’m not just saying that. like truly people stop her everywhere we go, she looks like Kendall Jenner but even more gorgeous and I am just generally average. So it can’t be jealousy",0.0,1.0110490322113037,1,0
88,1ehjfi3,AITA for not allowing my younger brother to play a game he wanted?,"So, a few weeks ago my (23nb) brother (18m) asked access to my Steam account to play a game which I had bought years earlier. I denied it. Why? Because I don't like to share any account of mine. But the real reason was that on my Steam account there are a few NSFW and LGBTQ+ games which I didn't want him to know about. (By the way, he does know that I am LGBTQ+ but have always been iffy or outright ignorant about it.)

He started making a fuss about it and as a compromise I said that I will buy the game for him for his Steam account. He still went upto our mother and made a strong claim regarding why he should be allowed access to my account. Even my mother agreed with him. And obviously I couldn't tell them the real reason so I tried making my point but it wasn't good enough for either of them. Finally I just turned both of their wishes down with a stern no.

However they both got angry with me and said that I should learn how to share. A few other people have called me out to be assholish as well. In the end everyone got angry, including me.

91,1ehiolb,AITA for telling a 16 year old I caught them cheating at trivia,"Hi, 
This whole situation is dumb. 
I was at trivia night with my friends at a local pub, the tables were all communal for context so we were seated directly next to our neighboring table. On the next table over were a group with one m16ish years old with 3 40ish women one of whom I would assume was his mom. 

I watch the m16 y/o kid pull out his phone, take pictures of the prompt type, and then fill in the question. 
I 30f said to the kid (who is sitting basically across from me) ""hey just being straight with you, I  saw you cheat"" 
The kid doubles down and starts shouting that everyone was cheating (they weren't) including our table (we weren't). The 3 women then also start SHOUTING, also doubling down that it was fine and I was out of line for saying anything. I walked away because of the shouting; I wasn't trying to argue with 3 grown women and especially not a child over something so silly.

Truly if that had been my 16 year old I would have done an ""oooo you got caught!"" Not ""how dare you tell my precious angel baby boy he can't openly cheat!""

Ultimately I feel I instigated an unnecessary confrontation that made the people I arrived with uncomfortable, I definitely didn't have to say anything. My intention wasnt repromanding him or reporting him to the game people I just wanted to razz the kid and tell him he wasn't being slick, and the game is less fun when you cheat and maybe make conversation with that table as it was a pub with communal atmosphere. 

 Ultimately there was  no real prize for winning, and I didn't care about winning the game; I was just flabbergasted and disappointed that parents would defend their kid openly cheating that hard like it's not going to translate to other areas of life. 

Still, my friends are generally non confrontational and probably would have preferred to ignore the interaction all together so this is where I Might be the a-hole. I did apologize to the people I came with profusely.

—————————original———————

I honestly feel like I WBTA but need outside perspective. So my (34F) and my husband (37M) have a 6 month old together and while we love our child and each other —-  life has been rough. The sleepless nights are affecting us. And we’ve been arguing more and more. But as soon as we get a good stretch of sleep we recognize that we’ve basically argued over nothing and we apologize and move on. But the stress of sleepless nights and having an infant is weighing on my husband a lot. His anxiety is flaring up like crazy and he’s fighting a depressive episode. Because of this - sometimes when he’s left alone with baby, if she’s extra fussy he’ll get a panic attack. Usually happens at night. Also happens if he gets nap trapped and feels stuck. 

So I have taken the lead on caring for baby overnight. Which means I’m now getting less sleep. But It seems to be working out slightly better. 

So about a month ago I started getting back into playing volleyball in a local adult rec league. I go once a week, for one game, and it’s actually 5 minutes down the road. When I go, I’m gone for at most 2 hours. 

The last two times I’ve gone - he’s ended up having a panic attack while I’m gone. And since I’m playing the game, I don’t see he texts until I’m done and then I rush home and take over. Which means I have to rush my night routine (shower, pump, etc). 

I feel awful that he’s left alone to deal with his anxiety attacks and has the baby to care for, so I think maybe I should quit until we have a better handle on things. 

But on the other side - I’m finally starting to feel like myself again. Going and playing is helping keep my mental health in check. It gives me a small break so I can come back and be mom and wife. 

Should I quit? Or WIBTA if I kept going?

**Context:**
I've been in a relationship for a while now, and recently, things have become very complicated. I'm struggling to figure out if I'm the asshole in this situation. Here’s what happened.

---

**The Situation:**
While I was pleading with my partner to give our relationship another chance on a Friday night, she had a random guy from Instagram over at her father's house. She had always claimed that my insecurity over her Instagram posts was unfounded, but now she was sneaking around with this guy. She lied to me, saying he was only in the garage, but he described her room and the living room perfectly.

This guy disrespected her by saying he should have robbed her and her father's house. He didn't seem to care about her at all, which is ironic because she broke up with me for ""disrespecting"" her. I have screenshots showing him at her location and even pictures she sent him of her lying in my aunt's bed.

My partner never really left me like she claimed. She was texting, calling, and referring to me as ""baby"" all the time, saying we were working on things. Yes, she suggested a break, but if that was the case, why should I be held accountable for anything? I've made mistakes in the past, but they were always a reaction to her breaking up with me. If I could marry her right now, I would, but she holds all the power in this relationship.

---

**Friday Night Incident:**
On Friday night, while I was begging her to reconsider, this guy spent the night at her place and left the next morning around noon. The same night, I had a strong hunch that she wasn't texting me back because she was with someone else. She lied to me, saying she wasn't with anybody, but I knew.

This guy she met in just one week ended up at her father's house. He even said he should have robbed her! How could she trust a random guy so quickly, especially knowing he's only 18 and has no car? He Ubered to her dad’s house.

The reason I sent this information to her mom was because the guy mentioned that he has her location and said he should have robbed her and her father's house. I felt it was important for her mom to know this for her safety.

95,1ehhz2e,"AITA for ""allowing"" my wife join the guys in my family when the women are cooking?","My wife (25f) and I (27m) have been married for 6 months and together for 7 years. My wife isn't close to her family (long story) and I had a pretty decent relationship with mine so when she graduated a year ago and we were ready to settle down, she wanted us to be near my family. They had met and things were okay so it seemed cool.

One thing I should mention is my family are more traditional, the women and men in the extended family mostly. My great grandma always believed that during family time women do the cooking and men should do their own thing, play outside, watch a game, something. My brothers and I know how to cook only because my dad, who married into the family with the traditional views, was not raised that way and knows how to cook. He was able to get us competent lol. I'm pretty good but not as good as someone who was taught more and earlier. But the traditional views were always weird to me and were not something I believed in ever. It was something I was upfront with my wife about when we were only dating.

My wife is an amazing cook. I will sing her praises every chance I get. She makes amazing food. She was super popular with her roommates and later our roommates in college when she'd agree to take on cooking duty. We both cook at home but I love every night she cooks.

The women in my family are jealous of this. Ever since we moved closer she was expected to join them in the kitchen. Her cooking got compliments from the family. The men didn't always realize it was her and would say they loved the changes made to a dish. As a direct result the female members of my family were being dicks to my wife and making comments about her not doing enough and being lazy but then trying to take over. My wife really wanted to be close to them so she tried so hard. But I hated seeing it and my dad couldn't get through to mom. So I told her she should step out of the kitchen and join us guys. She was hesitant to do so but had fun the first time and she fit right in and this pissed off the women in the family who told me I should be insisting she join them like she's supposed to. They said I should not ""allow"" her to skip cooking duty. I told them I encouraged her to stay with us since they were so unfair to her. I told them we could always skip seeing them if that would make them happier.

My wife feels bad. My dad joined me in telling her that the women are just being too hard on her and she doesn't deserve to be treated the way they were treating her. We talked about not attending and I enjoy being with the family less but she hopes it'll get better.

My mom confronted me alone and again told me I was wrong to ""allow"" this. I told my mom I love my wife and do not want her mistreated and excluded by my family. She said I'm not doing any favors hiding her from them. I told her they could try being nicer. She said I'm making this a bigger deal than it needs to be.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-01,"AITA for ""allowing"" my wife join the guys in my family when the women are cooking? My wife (25f) and I (27m) have been married for 6 months and together for 7 years. My wife isn't close to her family (long story) and I had a pretty decent relationship with mine so when she graduated a year ago and we were ready to settle down, she wanted us to be near my family. They had met and things were okay so it seemed cool.

One thing I should mention is my family are more traditional, the women and men in the extended family mostly. My great grandma always believed that during family time women do the cooking and men should do their own thing, play outside, watch a game, something. My brothers and I know how to cook only because my dad, who married into the family with the traditional views, was not raised that way and knows how to cook. He was able to get us competent lol. I'm pretty good but not as good as someone who was taught more and earlier. But the traditional views were always weird to me and were not something I believed in ever. It was something I was upfront with my wife about when we were only dating.

My wife is an amazing cook. I will sing her praises every chance I get. She makes amazing food. She was super popular with her roommates and later our roommates in college when she'd agree to take on cooking duty. We both cook at home but I love every night she cooks.

The women in my family are jealous of this. Ever since we moved closer she was expected to join them in the kitchen. Her cooking got compliments from the family. The men didn't always realize it was her and would say they loved the changes made to a dish. As a direct result the female members of my family were being dicks to my wife and making comments about her not doing enough and being lazy but then trying to take over. My wife really wanted to be close to them so she tried so hard. But I hated seeing it and my dad couldn't get through to mom. So I told her she should step out of the kitchen and join us guys.

We have argued before and I have always given in and accepted her behaviour which involves undermining me to my children and ignoring my rules.

I had my MOT last week and my car failed bad. Aunt was supposed to come over the day after but I rang her when my car failed and explained that if I don't have my car back by 1pm next day she wouldn't be able to come over as had to walk a hr to get my car back. She was angry and asked why I couldn't leave the kids 9f and 1f in the house with her for the couple of hours it would take. I said no as 1f is really hard to handle at the moment. 

Then next day I rang her to tell her my car wouldn't be ready by 1 more likely 3 or 4 so she wouldn't be able to come and have to rearrange for another day. She called me pathetic and I hung up. She then messaged me saying that she hated me and that she was going to come to my house to see my children whether I liked it or not . I live 45 mins away from her. 

I rang my MOT place and asked how long till my car would be ready they say by half 2 at the earliest so I got my kids ready and started the walk. We got there and they said car would be ready in a hr. I got a message from aunt saying she was outside my house and where was I calling me a liar about my car. I ignored her because I didn't want to argue around my kids. 

She kept ringing and messaging but I was busy with paperwork for my car. She had messaged saying she wasn't leaving my drive way until I came home and she spent time with my kids. 

I was worried about confrontation infront of my children so I called my mother in-law who lives half a hour away and asked her if I could come over. She said of course so I went there instead of going home. 

She kept messaging asking where I was so I told her I wasn't coming home as didn't want to argue in front of the children and that I couldn't be nice to her after she said she hated me. 

She told me she she wasn't leaving so I called my parents and told them I was feeling threatened as she wasn't leaving my property. My mother  contacted her and my father rang me, he told me to stay where I was.

98,1ehhom0,AITA for looking for my biological dad,"Family context: My mum realised she was pregnant with me 3 weeks after breaking up with my bio-dad (they were together for around 3 months, he never met our family or anyone else connected to us). She told him that she was pregnant with his kid but he wanted no involvement. As a result I’ve never met/interacted with/seen my biological dad before.

I’ve had one conversation with my mum about my biological dad years and years ago when was younger. Back then she told me some vague things about his appearance and his name, but only because I was so curious.
So to be completely clear - I know my dad’s first and last name, his hair colour and absolutely nothing more beyond that. Neither does anybody else aside from my mother.

The situation involves me, F(16) my mum F(50) and my biological dad M(Unknown)

I recently decided that I want to look for a picture of him online to see what he looks like (and anything else to discover online about him) to finally end the curiosity that has always persisted in the back of my mind. I’ve looked for him on the internet a few times before but failed.

So I sat down with my mum and asked if it would be alright to ask some questions about my bio dad so that I’ll have an easier time searching for him online. She was initially fine with it, but about 10-15 minutes into the conversation it went pretty downhill.

My mum suddenly asked how many more times I was going to have a conversation with her about my dad, because she finds it traumatic to relive her past by answering questions about him. (Which she did not mention to me before agreeing to talk about him.) She also claimed that I was being obsessive when asking about my bio-dad and told me to have all my questions over with now, so that she would never have to speak of him again.

I said to her that I didn’t think it was right nor accurate to call me “obsessive” for asking a few questions about my biological father who I know nothing about. Especially as both of her parents have always been apart of her life so shes not even close to understanding how I feel.

She also told me that I was making her
emotionally drained by asking her about him and that she wants to go and do other things that are more worthy of her time. Because of the emotional affect she told me it had on her, I felt pressured to agree to never ask about him again.

That’s pretty much all the necessary information but I can answer questions if needed.

100,1ehhlxk,AITA for setting boundaries with my grieving best friend after a year of being his caretaker?,"My best friend’s other close friend died in a horrible way about a year ago, and he’s been deeply traumatised and affected by it ever since. I completely understand that he’s struggling and have been supporting him as much as possible. I’ve been his personal caretaker, talking to him daily, even through the night, despite having to go to work early the next day. 

He refuses therapy or any professional help, so I’ve become his unofficial therapist. He refuses to take his prescribed antidepressants, which leads to massive arguments when I remind him.

Over the past year, it feels like he hasn’t been there for me at all. His needs always come first, and there’s no space for my own struggles. Even when I’m exhausted, I drive to him if he needs me. If there’s a choice between what I want and what he wants, i always let it be what he needs because of his tough time.

I don’t mean to be insensitive, but putting my needs aside for a year is taking a toll on me. Despite my own issues, that are severe, he hasn’t supported me at all. He doesn’t seem to have the emotional space to listen or care for my problems.

He often snaps or yells at me over minor issues, and i let him without standing up for myself because i understand it stems from him struggling. But this constant boundary-pushing is exhausting. It hurts that he doesn’t seem to care about how his behavior affects me.

He’s also expressed annoyance at hearing other people’s problems, saying they seem insignificant compared to what he’s experienced. This makes me feel like I can’t share my issues with him. When I do, he responds with “damn that sucks” and doesn’t engage deeply.

My best friend has changed since his loss. He’s consumed with anger and isn’t pleasant to be around. He only talks about himself, and while I listen and support him, it’s always about him first.

He might not acknowledge important texts from me but will flood me with updates about his new relationship. And when those relationships fail, I’m the one who ends up taking care of him.

I love him, and we’ve been best friends since we were 13, but this loss has altered him. I feel guilty for feeling this way but need recognition for my own feelings and struggles. I want to share my feelings without constantly pushing my boundaries and i miss being treated as a friend rather than just a therapist or frustration dumping ground.

102,1ehgvlc,AITA for refusing to help my sister after she kicked me out?,"So, I (21F) have a sister (27F) who has always had a bit of a rocky relationship with me. About six months ago, I was going through a tough time financially and emotionally after losing my job and breaking up with my boyfriend. My sister offered to let me stay with her until I got back on my feet. I was incredibly grateful and moved in with her.

Things were fine at first, but then she started setting really strict rules that made me feel like a prisoner in her home. No guests, no music, curfew by 8 (!) PM, etc. I did my best to follow her rules, but she would still find reasons to complain and criticize me. 

One night, I came home an hour late because my bus got delayed, and she completely lost it. She accused me of being irresponsible and disrespectful, and in the heat of the argument, she told me to pack my things and leave. I had no choice but to move out that night and crash on a friend's couch. 

Fast forward to now, I've managed to get a new job and a small apartment. Meanwhile, my sister has lost her job and is struggling to pay her rent. She called me a few days ago, asking if she could stay with me for a while. I told her no, explaining that I couldn't forget how she treated me when I needed help. She got really upset and said I was being petty and holding a grudge.

Our parents are divided on the issue. My mom thinks I should help her because ""family is family,"" but my dad says it's my choice and understands why I don't want to. Some of my friends also think I'm being too harsh, while others agree with me.

Things were fine at first, but then she started setting really strict rules that made me feel like a prisoner in her home. No guests, no music, curfew by 8 (!) PM, etc. I did my best to follow her rules, but she would still find reasons to complain and criticize me. 

One night, I came home an hour late because my bus got delayed, and she completely lost it. She accused me of being irresponsible and disrespectful, and in the heat of the argument, she told me to pack my things and leave. I had no choice but to move out that night and crash on a friend's couch. 

Fast forward to now, I've managed to get a new job and a small apartment. Meanwhile, my sister has lost her job and is struggling to pay her rent. She called me a few days ago, asking if she could stay with me for a while. I told her no, explaining that I couldn't forget how she treated me when I needed help. She got really upset and said I was being petty and holding a grudge.

Our parents are divided on the issue. My mom thinks I should help her because ""family is family,"" but my dad says it's my choice and understands why I don't want to. Some of my friends also think I'm being too harsh, while others agree with me.

So, am I the asshole for refusing to help my sister after she kicked me out?",0.0,0.007298441603779793,0,1
103,1ehgp6v,AITA for yelling at my parents for turning my brother's old room into a guest room?,"I (16F) and my two siblings (18F) and (21M) live with my parents (47F and 45M) in a three bedroom one story house. My entire life I've shared a room with my older sister while my older brother has gotten his own room. Recently, my brother has decided to move in with some friends because he wants to branch off from our parents house rules and move closer to his college. 

Both My sister and I were excited because we hate sharing a room. Our room is about the size of a large closet. We have bunk beds, we share a wardrobe and hanger rack for all of our clothes. Even with that being about it we have practically no floor space and the only room we have for personal stuff are a shelf each my dad installed after he decided he didn't want them in the master. 

I wouldn't mind it as much if the little privacy I had in my room wasn't constantly taken over by my sister. My sister has the top bunk, I don't mind having the bottom, but it means that she is constantly in my space. It may seem silly but my mattress space is the only area I have control over in our entire house and I definitely get protective over it because of that. My sister has always been the antagonistic type and likes to get into my space when she's bored because she thinks it's funny. She sits on my bed, takes my phone and looks through it, and pokes or grabs me and pulls me off the bed, I hate it.

A few days after he left I saw my parents looking for furniture and talking about going to IKEA for the room and I asked if my sister and I could come so we could have a minor input on the furniture. My parents told me that we couldn't because my mother already had a vision for the guest room. 

I asked if they really planned to make the room a guest room and they got upset, telling me I was ungrateful for feeling entitled to a room in their house and they could do what they wanted with their property without my judgment. I was fed up and a bit shocked as my parents, although strict, have always seemed to try at being fair. I screamed at them about how they can't really expect their two teenage daughters to live in a glorified closet until they move out for a guest room and that we just wanted privacy. 

They got angry at me and grounded me for being ungrateful and told me just because I was their child, it didn't mean I could guilt trip them into giving me the room when the one I already have is enough and my sister is mad at me because I ruined our chances of getting our own rooms. 

I wasn't trying to guilt trip them, but I feel like we need space and making a guest room is awful when we're stuck in one. Now I can't leave our room unless it's for school or other necessary things until I 'learn to appreciate what I have' and 'stop being a brat.'

Jason is like, a really cool dude, no problem hanging out with him and he sets boundaries. But for some reason recently when we're scrolling on twitter, he asked ""What do mantits feel like?"". Genuinely jaw dropped. Knew he was gay but DANG that made me do a double take. I asked him what he meant and he turned to ask me again to repeat his question. I'll be honest I had no idea how to reply but it got me flustered anyways? I dont know why though.

I'll be honest, I've had a huge crush on Jason for years, and I haven't been very clear about it. It's almost like he's perfect for me but I'm not gay, I dont think so at least. I dont wanna be in denial but I cant hold on for much longer, I'm so close to just kissing him on the lips and calling it a day.

So, one day I walked up to him and straight up just asked ""Do you like anyone?"", sure it was weird as shit but if he liked someone, why be so 'gay"" around me yknow? I dont even know if I'm using that term correctly anymore. He often goes to movies with me, restaurants and dates, like we're an actual couple. I asked him to cool it, to distance myself and I felt really bad seeing him frown. 

  
We haven't talked in just about 1 week and 2 days, what should i do about it now though? I think I just need advice but no one's telling me shit. I'll be honest I was really harsh when I told him to be less gay, I yelled at him a little when he started getting angry asking if I was homophobic and such but I couldn't help it, I let my love dive under and my feelings escape.

I've been playing piano for more than 10 years and every lesson before the term holidays, us students get to choose 10 lollies and a block of chocolate, so I did just like every other time where I would do this 4 times a year. My sister also got this up until recently as she quit piano (fair enough). A few nights ago I still had a sherbert packet and a lollipop left over that I didn't want to eat yet because I didn't feel like it. My sister asked me if she could have one almost every day and I always said no with an explanation. She was able to understand the explanation, but gets jealous when I have things and she doesn't because, of course, she's my sibling. At about 11:30 pm my sister went to my sleeping mother and asked if she could have my sherbert packet. My mother, who was still asleep, said yes, so my sister took it without me knowing and began to eat it at the kitchen table in the dark until I caught her while getting some water. When I asked her give it to me, she began to cry and say ""Somebody ate your lollipop too! Go check your lollipop!"" which wasn't actually true, she was trying to get me away. After a few minutes of the back and forth, I took it off her and instead of eating it myself I threw it in the bin (It had her tears all through it so it wasn't edible). The next day when talking to my sister and mother about it I was told that I was in the wrong and that it was just a lolly. I agree, the lolly wasn't a big deal, but I thought that the fact she had thought about how she was going to eat it without consequences and made a plan to get it, even going as far as trying to distract me shouldn't be let go lightly. She might be autistic but she isn't so high on the spectrum that she is very baby like and she can understand these concepts very well but since she's so used to having everything she wants if she cries hard enough she's becoming more and more manipulative and it's really starting to show.

108,1ehgbfa,WIBTA if I refuse to wear a saree that my in laws have chosen for me to wear on my wedding reception? ,"Sorry in advance everyone, English is not my first language but I am a content writer so you guys should be able to understand everything.

Now, I am (25f) an Indian, and we have a ritual here. The wedding reception is held one day after wedding and in-laws give their DILs the saree they are supposed to wear for that particular function. I was well aware of that and I have seen this happening since my childhood. Now a little background for you all. My wedding is in 10 days and the date was finalised back in February. I do a job and I have invested my weekoffs shopping and planning most of the wedding. 

I bought my wedding saree in March and that same day I liked another beautiful Benarasi Saree that I bought for wearing at the reception. Now, I discussed the thing with my fiance and asked him if his parents will be okay if I buy the saree and he told me I should go ahead and buy it and his parents would be more than happy to reimburse me because they are supposed to buy that for me anyway. He gave me the money I spent for that saree and I gave the blouse piece to my tailor so she could make a beautiful blouse for me. It was all sorted by May.

Fast forward to today, my future FIL sent me a courier which contained the blouse piece of ANOTHER BENARASI SAREE and I was shocked to discover that they were not aware that I already purchased the saree that I am gonna wear for reception. I bought my finance’s suit everything in a contrasting colour and bought my jewelleries accordingly. But NOW 10 days before I got to know my finance never told my future MIL or FIL that I already bought it in MARCH! 

So, I don’t want to disappoint them by not wearing the saree they have chosen for me. (I haven’t seen it yet, but I am sure it would be nice). But at the same time, I really had a vision with the Saree I originally chose to wear for this function and I am very upset right now that it will not be fulfilled. 

WIBTAH if I wear the one I originally planned to wear for this function instead of the one my future in laws bought for me?


Update: Just got off a call with my fiancé and he said it would be very “complicated” to talk to his parents now. I better wear the saree my future ILs bought for me and to make it up to me, he will purchase a new set of suit that will go appropriately with the saree. He will also go shopping with me again and bring the saree with him so I can find an appropriate blouse to go with it. P.S I have not seen the saree yet, he said he will send a picture tomorrow. 
Also, I am heartbroken and in tears as I write this because I believe all these could have been resolved with some better communication. 


Update 2: Today my fiancé denied that he ever had anything to do with it and told me “who asked you to go ahead and buy it?” And also told me I should wear the saree his parents have chosen for me (I still haven’t seen it).

I was wearing shorts with pockets, and at one point I felt my shorts go light, like my phone had disappeared from my pocket. I was waiting for a very important call so I looked for it frantically. He scared me by creeping up from behind and going 'oh look I've got your phone! Bet you didn't even notice! It's unlocked, ooh let's see what's on here!' before proceeding to start looking through my private messages.

I do not like having my privacy invaded or my things being taken from me without permission, so I took the phone back and told him off, educating him on why taking people's things without their permission isn't okay. He started crying and whining saying it was just a joke. 

Looks like his parents found out because I got an angry call from my gf's sister's boyfriend yelling at me and calling me an a-hole and a b word for upsetting his son and not being able to take a joke. My gf agrees with me but her sister and her boyfriend don't.

Keep in mind, I keep telling her to learn these things because i will soon move out and then there will be no one help her. She keeps pushing it back saying she’ll learn and buy a laptop. 
Lately, I have been feeling like all she messages me about is her work. Even if she takes me out, the conversation will somehow turn it her work talk and how I have to help her make something. I’ve helped her all these years without saying anything. These days it feels like she is emotionally manipulating to make me do it by saying that if she knew how to do it, she wouldn’t bother me with this stuff. She keeps on saying this everytime and then cries at the the drop of the hat because her life is a roller coaster right now. 
Today, she called me again asking me to fill in a report for her. I agreed but I forgot that I had to make dinner tonight. I told we could do it tomorrow. She called me crying that she would tell someone else to do it. (Bear in mind, I had already started the necessary changes for thing in the shared report on my laptop). Now she has hung up on me saying she won’t come over to do the report. AITA here?

112,1ehftm1,AITA for telling my MIL she can leave my house if she doesn't stop policing how I talk about my stepson?,"I'm (31f) married to Jake (33m) who has a son Devon (10m) with an ex Christy (34f). Jake and Christy broke up when Devon was a baby. They have shared custody 50/50 since. Christy remarried when Devon was 2. Jake and I met when Devon was 2.

I love Devon. Our relationship is good. But I am not his mom. He is not my son. When Jake and I got engaged he referred to Devon as our kid. MIL got so annoyed and said I am not his mom and never will be so Devon is therefore not my kid. I told her that was true, I'm just a bonus in his life and he's going to be my stepson (at that point he wasn't yet my stepson). She told me I should make sure I don't forget my place in his life. Jake told MIL that she had no right to talk to me that way and it wasn't even me who claimed Devon was my kid, it was him claiming he was ours.

Another time after Jake and I were married I called Devon my stepson. MIL only heard the son part and told me yet again Devon has a mom and I'm not her. I told her I said stepson. She was like oh, good, make sure you remember that.

Devon and I had some trouble for a while. Christy was encouraging him not to be nice to me like he was to his stepdad. So Devon had a period where he was disrespectful and said we're not stepmom/stepson. We did therapy, it helped. We went back to stepmom and stepson. He did make it clear he didn't want me to call him my son. I respect that. I told him I'd always respect those boundaries for him but please let me know if anything does change, so I can make any needed changes and keep us strong.

MIL randomly asked sometime after this if I was back to claiming Devon as mine. Jake told her to stop. He told her she knew I wasn't doing that and she needed to let it go. We spent some time away from her, she apologized, mostly because FIL wasn't interfering like that and saw his grandson and son still.

Jake and I have a son together now. Now MIL has flipped a switch because Jake and I have our own son together. She has decided I'm a monster for calling Devon my stepson still and she's now policing me staying stepson instead of son. It's not like it comes up that often but it comes up often enough for her to be bothered by it. If I say I'm here to pick up my stepson instead of son, or say this is my stepson Devon. Jake told her to knock it off and she remembers what happened before with her policing me like this.

MIL dropped by the house to see the baby while my husband was at work. She brought it up to me again. She said now that Devon has a brother we need to stop the step crap and I should be calling both boys my sons. I told her to drop the topic. I did not want this to be a fight again. She ignored me and told me I need to do better. I told her she needs to leave my house if she can't stop policing how I speak, that I would not allow it. She hadn't expected me to follow through. She also didn't expect Jake to be on my side. She said I was rude and refuse to discuss it like an adult.

113,1ehfsr4,AITA for asking to have a fan back,"I really don't think I'm in the wrong here but other people do so here we go. 

A few weeks ago I (19F) went on a trip with 10 other 19 year olds I had never met to do volunteering and hiking in another country. This country is very hot and I struggle greatly in heat. After a two days of struggling, I asked the host if there was anyway to make my room, which I shared with two other girls, cooler. She gave us a fan. All the other people were understandably jealous, but instead of asking for one they just resented me which I found weird. Even the two girls in my room wanted to make it clear that they did not ask for the fan, that it was all ""my doing"". 

That first night with the fan I couldn't sleep. The fan was right next to my head and it was really loud and I had no ear plugs. The two other girls in my room were already asleep and had made clear that they didn't ask for the fan, so, as i had heard the boys complaining the most, i took them the fan and said I would be happy to lend it for the night until I could buy some earplugs the next day. They were grateful and took it.

The next morning the two girls in my room complained that I had ruined their sleep and they were too hot and needed the fan back and said I should have asked them. While I had assumed they didn't want it, I did agree I probably should have asked, but they were asleep. Either way I went to get the fan back. The boys were reluctant but gave it back. 

This is where it gets weird. After eating all together at a restaurant that night, the boys left before everyone else. When we got back they had gone into our room and taken the fan without asking. Annoyed by the lack of respect I went to their room to ask for it back and they tried hiding from me. it took a long time to get it back. Once I had it back I went to bed, I hadn't found any earplugs that day but i was going to stick it up for the girls in my room. When the boys came back to ask for it, they called me selfish and rude. The girls in my room didn't back me up here. Angry and tired I told the boys to just ""go ask for your own f-wording fan"". 

The next day was miserable with the boys constantly making snide remarks about my behaviour, attitude and looks (which felt unnecessary) which was made worse by family issues and the fact that I hadn't slept well. 

The next morning, after a relatively uneventful but restless night, I found out my grandfather had died. Upset, I stayed back from the trip that day. While the group was gone one of the girls messaged me that they'd made an agreement with the boys as I was so stubborn and we were going to share the fan with them. this felt unfair as I was the first person to even suggest we share the fan. But I was upset and very bored of the whole situation so said nothing.

Anyway it was pointless in the end as every room got given a fan. The boys were unpleasant for the remaining 3 weeks of the 4 week trip and no one gave me their condolences. But I had sworn at them.

118,1ehe2w9,AITA for not picking up my Facebook auction winnings?,"So the other day I (22F) won an auction on Facebook marketplace. I really like this auction page and I win often. The whole time I’ve been a member of the page, I’ve picked up my winnings no problem. Most times I go to the persons house and pick up, other times we meet at a central location, or I Venmo (or some other app like that) them before hand and pick it up at their front door. I work afternoons/nights so a lot of this is done before 2pm.

Recently, I won an auction and the person who was selling was moving and needed the stuff gone ASAP. We agreed on a time the next day and I messaged her when I was on my way, and messaged her when I was there. There was no response. To get to the house, it looked like you had to climb a bunch of stairs. It was kind of like a condo complex. I was apprehensive to go and knock on the door. I don’t really know why. It’s just not something that I’m used to doing with the transactions. I also try to be weary of knocking on random peoples doors in case I had the wrong address or something.

Anyway, after waiting for 15 minutes I messaged the person and said I had to go and I would message her later. She messaged me a little while after saying she thought I’d knock and asked if I was available to pick up during the week. She also gave me her friends phone number and said the stuff was at his house to pick up which confused me a lot.

She works days so she said she was only available after 5pm (which I am not as I stated before). I asked her if should could do a porch pick up and I pay her before to which she responded no to because she has a landlord and the stuff was too big. I also asked if I could meet her somewhere during her lunch hour and she said no and that the stuff wouldn’t fit in her car. 

It was looking like we weren’t going to be able to find a time for me to pick it up so I just offered to send her the money and be done with it. She said I shouldn’t have bid on the items if I wasn’t going to be flexible. I feel like I was trying to resolve the issue and she was the one not being flexible. If she just answered her phone in the first place, this wouldn’t have happened.

Anyway, she said she was going to report me to the admins, so we’ll see if they just take her word for it or do some type of investigation lol.

So my question is, AITA for not picking the stuff up? I feel like this whole thing would have been avoided if she just answered her phone or told me to ring the bell in the first place.

",Not the A-hole,2024-08-01,"AITA for not picking up my Facebook auction winnings? So the other day I (22F) won an auction on Facebook marketplace. I really like this auction page and I win often. The whole time I’ve been a member of the page, I’ve picked up my winnings no problem. Most times I go to the persons house and pick up, other times we meet at a central location, or I Venmo (or some other app like that) them before hand and pick it up at their front door. I work afternoons/nights so a lot of this is done before 2pm.

Recently, I won an auction and the person who was selling was moving and needed the stuff gone ASAP. We agreed on a time the next day and I messaged her when I was on my way, and messaged her when I was there. There was no response. To get to the house, it looked like you had to climb a bunch of stairs. It was kind of like a condo complex. I was apprehensive to go and knock on the door. I don’t really know why. It’s just not something that I’m used to doing with the transactions. I also try to be weary of knocking on random peoples doors in case I had the wrong address or something.

She broke up with her HS sweetheart at 21 because he didn't propose after 5 years together, and she talked about giving him an extra year since they were both in college. That was the only reason. She said she'll always love him and wish they had worked out. She broke up with her next partner after 3.5 years because he showed no signs of wanting to get married yet and she broke up with another guy just a few months ago because he told her that's BS and there is no right timeline for marriage and kids unless you're really rushing.

A few days ago I was picking something up from my dad, Izzie was there.

She has a 17 year old son and a 17 year old stepson in her home. The boys knew each other since kindergarten and they never got along. I remember my sister telling the rest of the family that she was called in and asked if she'd object to her son and ""the other child"" being buddied for a few weeks so they could work out their issues. Sister said that was fine. They tried for 7 weeks or something like that. They were seat pals, each other's helper and were given small ""jobs"" to do together to build a better dynamic and it failed. The whole time they were next to each other it was hell in the class. This dynamic did not let up. The two of them do not like each other, I personally do believe they truly hate each other.

Then my sister and her husband started a relationship. Prior to them moving in together and also prior to the wedding, many of us spoke to my sister about what a bad idea it seemed to be because the boys were not capable of getting along. She told us they'll have to once they're family and it'll do them some good. I asked her if she really believed that and if she really wanted to live in a house where two members do not want to see the other ever. She told me she loved her husband (then fiancé) too much to end things or hold off on marriage. She also told me she was going to convince her son to give her stepson a chance to be a friend if nothing else. That the kids clash in personality and they have some shared interests so they can work it out. She didn't like when our dad took her aside before the wedding and warned her it would end badly because of the boys.

My sister and her husband have a son together now. He's also caught in the middle of both of his half brothers hating each other. We all became a witness to just how much these two do not want to be near each other. We  witnessed fights, glares, all kinds of things. My sister's stepson lost his shit on our great aunt for calling them brothers.

There was an incident a couple of weeks ago. My nephew lost a friend. He'd been sick for a while and sadly passed away just before his 17th birthday. My sister and her husband wanted all four of them to attend the funeral, with their son together going to our parents. Her stepson didn't want to go, said he didn't want to support my nephew and he didn't care. He thought it was funny as hell how upset my nephew was. Said he hated the dead kid too. While at the funeral my sister and her husband were sympathizing with the boys parents and expressed that both nephew and step-nephew said kind things about their son. They told my sister and her husband there was no way step-nephew said kind things about their son and he shouldn't have been there.

My sister said it was humiliating to realize other people are so aware of the bad blood. She then said we never warned her and I corrected her and said we did and she didn't listen. She told me we didn't try hard enough and how dare I say we did enough.

There was an incident a couple of weeks ago. My nephew lost a friend. He'd been sick for a while and sadly passed away just before his 17th birthday. My sister and her husband wanted all four of them to attend the funeral, with their son together going to our parents. Her stepson didn't want to go, said he didn't want to support my nephew and he didn't care. He thought it was funny as hell how upset my nephew was. Said he hated the dead kid too. While at the funeral my sister and her husband were sympathizing with the boys parents and expressed that both nephew and step-nephew said kind things about their son. They told my sister and her husband there was no way step-nephew said kind things about their son and he shouldn't have been there.

My sister said it was humiliating to realize other people are so aware of the bad blood. She then said we never warned her and I corrected her and said we did and she didn't listen. She told me we didn't try hard enough and how dare I say we did enough.

126,1ehcn3w,WIBTA if I told my family that someone should maybe get a job?,"I, a 26-year-old woman, have worked, been in school, or both since I was 18. At 19, I dropped out of school and began working a trade full-time, then returned to school full-time at 21 or 22. When I decided to pursue an MA, my parents and I agreed they would help me if I attended a fully-funded program. They paid my rent while I used my stipend for other expenses. We agreed on a similar arrangement for a Ph.D. program, where I'd use my stipend to split rent with them and cover my living expenses. I am extremely, *extremely* grateful and privileged to have had this support.

For about six weeks this summer, I’ve been unemployed as I move and begin my program. This is the first time since 18 that I haven’t been working or in school, and my parents encouraged me to rest for a few weeks before starting my Ph.D. To manage this, they would, very generously, cover my August rent.

Now, my mother confessed that they have 0 dollars in their checking account. They’ll make my rent, but money will be extremely tight in August. I have virtually nothing and now they likewise have virtually nothing.

Here’s where my issue begins.

My dad (65) retired in 2020 and does some freelance consulting. My mother (60) stopped working when my sister and I were little and hasn’t worked since, except for some substitute teaching when I was in middle school. My sister (31) has never had a job. She married at 22 and left her husband two years ago. Since then, she’s been living with my parents, not working, and not contributing financially. My parents cover *all* household expenses, including her new health insurance.

On the phone, my mother listed the expenses that have drained their accounts. She assured me these struggles are common for “all middle-class families.” I’m not so sure. Middle-class families, after all, have to work and draw an income.

I was numb when I got off the phone. I have worked hard for years, including \~50 hours a week in a trade and winning a university award for distinguished master’s students due to my efforts. I have signed a contract to continue working hard as a Ph.D. student and pay for everything I can myself.

Meanwhile, my sister has never worked and feels no urgency to start. Now my parents have 0 dollars in their checking account and are stressed about finances. What I can’t bring myself to say is: If money is this tight, shouldn’t someone in that household try getting a job?

I feel it’s entitled and ungrateful to say that, but I can’t understand why I’ve been the only one in my family working full-time or studying full-time for years. 

If I had known money would be this tight, I would have deferred my Ph.D. and entered the workforce. But I didn’t know that and didn’t do that. I’ll be taking out student loans next semester, but I want to shake these people and say, “Wake up and DO something.” I’ve never confronted them like this before, and I feel selfish and entitled.

I have tried putting my feelings aside to let him have fun and I have even thought it was my overthinking that caused me to think this way but I’m just not sure anymore. Me and my bf are long distance so it creates a barrier in our communication. He has known Ash for around 4 years and I got with my bf after knowing him for about 3 weeks. As you can tell, he has known Ash longer than me which is why I hate to invade on their relationship. My bf and I have only had arguments about Ash for the past few months since I was introduced to her halfway through our relationship. I tried to be her friend at the beginning but she just shrugged me off and never made an attempt. And the thing is she is dating my bfs male best friend. There were little things at the very beginning of me knowing about her that made me take a break from my bf because it felt that he was choosing her over me sometimes but we worked it out. I have communicated how I am uncomfortable with certain things such as them wrestling in the pool and him saying I love you. He stopped touching her and I was happy about it but continued to say I love you. I acted like it didn’t bother me but it did. But yesterday my bf was texting Ash about how she was “defending her shitty bf” (what my bf said). And as he showing me his screen on FaceTime he stops and said “oh sorry my phone was gunna die”. I said ok and didn’t think much of it. At this time I was perfectly ok with them hanging and texting. We fixed our last problem so there was no need to be upset. But then today my bf tells me that he stopped screen sharing because he said he loved her. I would have aloud him to say I love you to her but it’s the fact that he hid that from me and lied. He did tell me yesterday that she said I love you and I didn’t care about that. I was just hurt that after so many arguments over their relationship that he would tell me the truth. I asked him why he did what he did and he said he didn’t want to hurt me. I told him it hurt me more by lying to me.

128,1ehc2aq,AITA for Accidentally Dropping my 4 year old cousin?,"This is a fun one. I (M14) recently visited with my immediate family an aunt/uncle's in which they have a 4 year old cousin who i'm just going to call George because why not. When I arrived the Aunt (Cindy from now on because she feels like a cindy) was carrying George around and letting everyone hold him. When he got to me and I was asked if I wanted to hold George I said no as I don't know how much a chubby 4 year old weighs nor do I care to find out, and I didn't see a reason to hold the kid I could talk to in Cindy's arms or George can walk.

  
Cindy insists and says it'll be fine and I should hold him because it'll be fun. I again say it's fine and to go onto my grandpa who was next. She extends her arms and as she drops George into my hands despite my instruction,  my instinct is to pull away and George falls on to the floor below. He's fine but whines like crazy for 10 minutes as you'd imagine a 4 year old would in this scenario, She picks him up and yells at me before I scream at her about how she shouldn't have dropped him and walk off. My mother is now upset at me, not for ""dropping"" him but for ""making a scene and screaming at Cindy"". The rest of my family hasn't brought it up, and the Uncle agrees with me (he cool like that though)

129,1ehbvmn,AITA for not accepting my boyfriends answer of what makes me special and getting upset,"This is my first post on reddit overall and i usually don’t use this app very often but i really need advice on this. As silly as it might sound. My boyfriend is an active user tho so i hope he doesn’t see this.

I (20F) struggle with a lot of mental health issues, my boyfriend (20M) knows this very well and always tries to help me. Im very grateful for this. Yesterday i was having a very hard day and he was trying to comfort me. I told him that i know im replaceable and i have no real good quality to distinct me from other woman. My boyfriend disagreed saying im one of a kind and he can never find any better. I was already feeling a little better so i told him to say one thing thats special about me that he likes, so i can go to sleep happy. He couldn’t reply. He kept saying “you in general”, or “everything about you”. I wasn’t expecting anything too romantic anyway, maybe something like “your kindness, how good you are with animals etc.” Instead he just couldn’t come up with ANYTHING. I got more upset at this and begged him to give me something, anything. He said the way i cuddle him. This made me start to cry as i think thats the most basic answer ever. I told him that doesn’t reflect my personality or who i am and we cuddle because we are lovers and i love him not because i am who i am. I was devastated and he argued saying the way i cuddle reflects my personality and that it was a pretty genuine answer. I begged him for anything else and he was upset im taking this issue too far and wanted me to drop it.

We have been together for 2 years and i genuinely wanted to marry him but now this is really bothering me. Is this genuinely a good answer and im just being a a**hole or is this really not something a person who loves you would say? Help me out please thank you.

[EDIT]: Just to clarify as some of you are misunderstanding. I didn’t say im replaceable just to get an answer from him saying im not. It was a part of my vent (which he give me permission to vent I would never force him to listen) He answered me on his own. After that i in a kinda flirty way asked “Like what makes me special” and he couldn’t answer. I wasn’t trying to manipulate him and im sorry if it sounds that way. Hes at work at the moment so i cant talk with him right now but i will bring up the topic and apologize when he’s available.

[UPDATE] I already came to the conclusion that i was unnecessary and overreacted before i write this post. I just posted this reddit to basically confirm my fears. And it did. We talked properly after he returned from work and i sincerely apologized for my words. I also apologized for the way my mental health is hurting our relationship. He said he understands my frustration and dont blame me for this. He said he’s happy to help me (or try at least) and he’s happy i clarified the situation. I did also promised to try harder to see a professional (parent problems) and he thanked me. We are good and he’s not hurt. I told him about this post and he called me “silly” so i say we are doing pretty well :) Thank you for all the kind answers and people who were genuinely helpful ♡ The others who just called me manipulative and many other rude things.

They asked where their share was but I just pointed out they didn't even pay to be there and didn't answer a single question so why should they get anything.

132,1ehbpsf,AITA for making my husband drive the car he wrecked ,"My (f22) husband (m24) got his license June 14 and wrecked my car June 19. It wasn’t technically his fault because he hit a deer but the damage was really bad because he hit it going 45 mph. I say technically because a more experienced driver would have gone slower when they spotted the herd even though they weren’t actively on the street. The damages have come out to $3600 in parts, $800 in labor, and an unknown amount for paint. The repairs will be done in 2-3 weeks. Insurance didn’t cover it because for whatever reason the changes didn’t take when I added him to my insurance and he was listed as an excluded driver. 

When we found out it was going to take this long for my car to be fixed we bought a new car. I’m the one who got us a rental while we waited for it to be delivered, spent 6 hours on the phone, filed all the paperwork, and picked it out. The car is in my name but he co-signed and paid the down payment. This month will be the first month my direct deposit goes to his account but historically I pay 100% of the bills and we use what he makes for fun money and savings. We make the same amount of money I’m on VA disability and he’s still active duty. 

He used to carpool to work but our roommates car broke down 3 weeks ago so they’ve been taking the Tiguan and I’ve been stranded. I had to give up everything I normally do during the day and I haven’t seen my friends in weeks. I can’t go to the gym, to the bookstore, to get coffee, to the store, and I had to quit my ice skating lessons I waited 6 months to take. I’m going a bit crazy being cooped up 24/7. He works so much we always spend weekends together but his younger brother recently moved in with us so when we do go out it’s a family event opposed to a date or something I can do myself.

With the Jetta almost repaired the talk of who is driving what car came up. We had originally decided to buy a truck and have it be my vehicle while he used the Jetta as a daily driver since it has better mileage and he drives an hour round trip for work. We agreed on this when he got his license before he wrecked my car. He changed his mind to wanting a SUV so we got the Tiguan instead. Now he’s saying he wants the new car to be his and for me to keep driving the Jetta especially between it getting fixed and it getting painted. I said he’s the one who wrecked it so he’s the one that has to drive it, paint or not. He’ll only have to drive it without paint max 2 weeks. It’s a 2020 so it’s not old or anything like that. The Tiguan is a 2023. 
The Jetta still has better mileage but the difference isn’t huge like it would have been if it was a truck. I still think the more experienced driver should get the newer car and that I definitely shouldn’t have to drive the Jetta before it’s painted since I’m not the one that wrecked it.

We agreed on this when he got his license before he wrecked my car. He changed his mind to wanting a SUV so we got the Tiguan instead. Now he’s saying he wants the new car to be his and for me to keep driving the Jetta especially between it getting fixed and it getting painted. I said he’s the one who wrecked it so he’s the one that has to drive it, paint or not. He’ll only have to drive it without paint max 2 weeks. It’s a 2020 so it’s not old or anything like that. The Tiguan is a 2023. 
The Jetta still has better mileage but the difference isn’t huge like it would have been if it was a truck. I still think the more experienced driver should get the newer car and that I definitely shouldn’t have to drive the Jetta before it’s painted since I’m not the one that wrecked it.

133,1ehbgul,AITA for not paying attention to a friend's birthday plans,"I will first I guess post this without background info for the sake of trying to be objective. 

I (28F) have a group of friends, we are all girls in our late 20's to early 30's. We have a large group chat together. At least 5 out of 11 of us have started to have a general dislike towards one person. 

Personally, I think she's someone I'm fine to keep as an outer circle/friend for specific hobbies and situations but I would no longer consider her one of my closest friends for various reasons. 

This friend, I'll call her Alice, her birthday is coming up soon. I thought it was a little strange she had yet to mention anything she wanted to do to celebrate, but figured she would bring something up eventually. 

Yesterday, I saw that she tweeted on a private account that she has for ranting and whatever. (I don't know if she remembers that I follow her there.) Basically she was saying about how she feels like everyone hates her and nobody responded to her subtle hints at birthday outings so she was feeling extra depressed and wondered if she should just go on her own. 

I shared this with some of our mutual friends and they were also confused because while we've been distancing from her, we definitely wouldn't have ignored her trying to make birthday plans. 

I scrolled back through the chat and discovered that she had mentioned an event that would be cool to go to for her birthday but no questions or comments about concrete plans like setting a date or time. [Edit: We didn't ignore this on purpose, she didn't try to actually make a plan so everyone thought it was just a casual suggestion and were waiting for her to initiate a date/time.]

None of us brought it up in the chat but today she messaged directly something among the lines of: Well since nobody responded to my attempts to make birthday plans I'm going to go do A and B and if you want to come you can. 

I decided ok I'll bite and responded that I never knew she had brought anything up for her birthday, to which she clarified the instances. The first one was the one I figured out and I'm pretty sure the second one never actually happened because I can't find any traces of her bringing it up and neither can anyone else. 

I said oh sorry I was waiting for you to ask or clarify about a date and time. Others responded along the same lines and that this coming weekend would be difficult because they're busy and a bit far away, so we need to make plans more ahead of time. [Edit: Dates and time suggestions were made and apologies for not realizing she was trying to subtly initiate plans! We said we were happy to do something but one friend is currently in the process of moving, making it difficult to meet up.]

She didn't really respond to this and later changed the subject, so I replied asking if we were going to make a plan or not. She said she didn't want to mess up whatever everyone had planned already but if someone wanted to come that would be nice. 

Nobody has responded since. [Edit: I am going to say I am down to go hang out, the vibe was kinda rotten earlier so I didn't reply and I felt at a loss?] 

I think this is where we might be the assholes, not doing more to resolve the tension or I guess just being straight up that we don't want to hang out with her that much. 

However, I am a personal believer in not giving into passive aggressive-ness and also everyone this year has very clearly planned their own birthday celebrations and set everything up. 

Final additions and context: 

I wanted to see what people thought about this specific issue but to add context about WHY we've grown much further from this person over the past few years:

Alice has skipped out on one birthday this year because she was hungover and left other birthday festivities early because she made plans after the fact. She also skipped out on an overnight trip because of money but then bought concert tickets that were much more expensive, and when we said we thought she didn't have money, she responded with ""Well I mean I want to spend money on what I will enjoy more."" and amongst a plethora of other grievances has generally never seemed like she puts out friendship ahead of much else, but gets easily upset over things like this. 

When she comes to us with problems, we used to always be supportive or give advice as we would with anyone else, but are always met with arguments.

134,1ehbdyr,AITA for getting mad my  mom planned her anniversary party on my birthday ,"I (20F) am the only child to my parents (F55 and M59). My mom has been planning her 25th wedding anniversary party, and I have been supportive of this. But today she told me her party would be on the exact day as my birthday. You might ask why, as if I don't know her anniversary and my bday land on the same day, but they don't! Their wedding anniversary is in August, and my bday is in January. Due to reasons, my mom planned to move the party back but I never expected her to choose out of all days of the year to be my 21st birthday. 

When I asked if she knew that it was my birthday, she looked surprised, almost like she forgot, but then said yes with a smile on her face.This is not the first time she’s forgotten my birthday

And when I asked her if she couldn't have picked any other day of the year? She blew up! Told me I was ungrateful, and that this is the ONLY day that it can be done and work for everyone she wants to attend, can attend (150+ people). I told her I was uncomfortable with spending my birthday, and the whole week in another country (we live in the US but the party will be held in my parents home country) She said I was making her sad by saying these things, and that I was hurting her feelings. I said she's hurting my FEELINGS, to not even be asked about this, then told there was nothing I could do about it. She said the world doesn't revolve around me, that I was extremely spoiled to make ""her big day"" all about me, that other girls would be proud of her parents for reaching such a big occasion, and if it bothers me that much that her party and my bday are on the same day, then I should just forget my birthday even exists, and not to remind anyone 

And maybe she's right, I know that when you get older your birthday just becomes another day.

I never really had birthday parties growing up. And since my bday is so close to christmas I've never had enormous presents since from a young age I would get one medium in Christmas another medium in January. I am an only child and grew up around adults, But I do have good memories of my b-day, getting ice cream with my dad, going to the museum with my parents, or my mom taking me to buy my first pieces of makeup. I know 21 is usually a big day of possible alcohol poisoning, but I rarely drink, so my bday will not be some Vegas trip, but still I want it to be my day, and do something I wanted .

My parents have worked hard their entire lives to give me a comfortable life, I've never had to go without. I have a roof over my head, don't pay them rent, have my own car, and they pay for my school. So I do feel like a brat for complaining about their big party being on my birthday and sacrificing my day, but they've sacrificed for me over the years. So I feel dumb for crying and being mad at my mom. Am I the asshole?

She always told me how the lady in the charge (I'll call her Sarah for the sake of making this understandable) would purposefully put any male staff into stressful situations. They had an employee for a year, Dylan. Mid twenties, regular nice guy. I met him once, he was pretty cool. At least once a month, she'd put him in charge of an extremely understaffed shift and then yell at him for forgetting things. She'd give him tasks that nobody ever had to do just for the sake of it.

A few months ago they got a new male colleague, Jack. Barely twenty. Sarah would give him tasks he hasn't ever done before and expect him to do it right.

Sundays the store is closed and Saturday are the busiest day. My mom sat him down one day because he was walking around the place looking like he was on the verge of a breakdown.

136,1ehb39d,AITA for leaving lunch with friends for not waiting for me to eat?,"Hi all. This happened several months ago and I can’t help but wonder if I am the asshole. 

My friend and her husband invited me out to lunch and I recommended a quaint little Mexican restaurant. Well it turns out, that restaurant had the wrong information posted of when they are open and were actually closed on Sunday. 

We then drove to another restaurant nearby, and again, not serving food and completely empty. At this point, my tank is running low from all the driving around trying to find a spot. 

We decide on a restaurant that we know is open and I tell them that I will be delayed by 10 minutes because I need to put gas. I ask them to wait for me at the restaurant. 

When I arrive at the restaurant which is buffet style, both of them have already finished a plate. I have been to this restaurant with my friend and her husband before and usually all she gets is a plate to begin with so I was confused as to why they would invite me out and couldn’t even wait 10 minutes for me before eating. 

So naturally, I mumbled under my breath “Wow y’all already finished eating. That’s kind of rude.” 

My friend responded “what did you say?” I didn’t really feel like repeating so her husband reiterated. She then said “well this is just our first plate, we’re going to get more.” 

I said “really, every time we come here you usually only get one plate. I think it’s a bit rude that you couldn’t wait for me, I was only 10 minutes late.” 

She then became agitated and started saying she was “VERY HUNGRY” and that she needs to be on a schedule due to being on her ozempic weight loss medication. I then asked if she had breakfast that morning and she responded yes. At that point I did not say anything else and everything then became blurry for me because I just remember her raising her voice and me feeling uncomfortable. I was embarrassed because it felt like we were causing a scene in the middle of the restaurant. So I told her “I feel uncomfortable and I’m going to leave.” She said “Oh you’re going to leave?! Go ahead.” 

I do realize that I was sensitive to the fact that they didn’t wait, however it was for good reason. The trigger was another instance where we had all gone to the river to go tubing and I was with my ex at the time. We let her and her husband go in front of us to pay for their tubes and sign their waver. Well, I kid you not, by the time we have our tubes, her and her husband were already in the water and the river was sweeping them away. I asked my ex where they were and we saw them down the river. I couldn’t believe that they couldn’t wait not even a few minutes for us to grab our tubes so we could get in the river together. It took a great effort to catch up with them. 

So anyway, I messaged my friend later on and I told her “although I was disappointed that you and your husband had eaten without me, I don’t think it’s enough to ruin this friendship.”

This picture I remember very clearly, it was a couple years ago back when we were in quarantine, i was sitting at a webcam during an online class (me and Jane had some classes together and she must have screenshotted) i think it's pretty clear i was crying recently before the picture but i don't know, and i was crying because the night before i had tried to take my life via pills and it fortunately did not work.

jane told me that pictures of me where being sent around and tried to pretend it wasn't her though was giggling the entire conversation. i was pretty sure it was her but decided to suck it up and let it blow over.

this decision did not go well. the next few days i would see my gf laughing at something on a screen with a friend of ours or occasionally jane and whenever i would ask what their laughing at they would turn the screen away and say its nothing.

though one day my gf sent me the pictures saying ""look what i found🤭"" not fun tbh

my mental health has never been great and the people i love most laughing at a photo of me at my worst was definitely not helping. i ended up venting about all of this to one of my closest friends (we will call them Alex) Alex was beyond pissed after hearing this, especially when me, Alex and my gf were talking and my gf offered to show them ""some very funny"" photos of me.

so, Alex got really mad and kind of went off on my gf and jane. this i definitely should have handled better because i didn't tell them not to go off on them but my gf did end up apologizing (though she didn't seem very sorry about it)

then somehow an argument happened between my friends over it (i believe it was because i had Alex tell them to stop and not doing it myself, witch again that was dumb and i shouldn't have done that) so the next few days i was completely ignored by all of my friends which impacted my already fragile mental health pretty poorly. i ended up having to schedule a therapy appointment because i kept having panic attacks whenever i thought about it too much.

the therapist says i should apologize to them but i don't know, i don't think I'm the asshole here? sure i definitely should have and could have handled it way better but also, they are ignoring me over asking for them to stop passing the photo around (and how i handled it, that was a bad call on my end but I've acknowledged that and apologized). but i don't know, if that many people are upset at me because of it am i the asshole?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-01,"AITA for asking for a picture of me at a sensitive time to stop being passed around and laughed at?

then somehow an argument happened between my friends over it (i believe it was because i had Alex tell them to stop and not doing it myself, witch again that was dumb and i shouldn't have done that) so the next few days i was completely ignored by all of my friends which impacted my already fragile mental health pretty poorly. i ended up having to schedule a therapy appointment because i kept having panic attacks whenever i thought about it too much.

the therapist says i should apologize to them but i don't know, i don't think I'm the asshole here? sure i definitely should have and could have handled it way better but also, they are ignoring me over asking for them to stop passing the photo around (and how i handled it, that was a bad call on my end but I've acknowledged that and apologized). but i don't know, if that many people are upset at me because of it am i the asshole?",0.0,-0.003709292272105813,0,1
139,1eh9rj1,AITA for canceling an Amazon order?,"So I (24F) use to let my younger cousins Henry (21M) and Alice(19F) use my Amazon account. Genuinely did not care cause I used to live with them and got tired of them always telling me to buy the whatever for them. 

Then the oldest cousin started dating a girl named Sarah (19F) who I absolutely do not like. The reason being that last year she basically used me as a getaway driver to steal a couple hundreds of dollars worth of crap from the mall. Ever since that day I never said a word to her cause she’s not my friend and I don’t like that she put me in a situation I wasn’t aware of till it was too late. And instead of apologizing or whatever she was making herself the victim and just making it a huge drama deal. But at the end of the day she was dating my cousin so I just stayed quiet and minded my own business. 

That was until I heard that she and Henry broke up about a month ago. Since they broke up then I no longer felt the need to care about the girl. And I knew Henry was always ordering stuff for her using my Amazon account when they were together. Then one day Sarah texted  Alice to use my Amazon account. Alice asked me and I said no. So Alice told Sarah that I didn’t want her to use my account. And instead of the accepting that, she went to go ask Henry. And Henry bought the item she asked for, knowing damn well I do not like the girl and don’t want her using my stuff. So I canceled the order. After I cancelled the order I changed my password to the Amazon which then kicked out everyone who was using it. 

This caused a bigger drama than I expected. My aunt is defending Henry saying “Well if you’re letting him use your Amazon account then he should buy for who ever he wants. Why would you cancel the order?” Like I understand I let him use the account, but I let him use it for him. And the only reason I tolerated him using it for his ex was because they were together. 

So AITA? 

Additional info if it matters : Sarah was just ordering a bed rail for her younger brother. Besides the fact that I don’t like her for using me to steal, their relationship was just toxic. Sarah would cheat on Henry constantly. She would break up with him for a couple months so she can be with other guys but once it was around the holidays she’ll go back to him so she can get gifts. Just recently this girl brought her new boyfriend to a family party knowing damn well my cousin was going to be there. No one in the family likes her because of how she treats my cousin. 

Forgot to add: It was my cousin’s card that was used just my Amazon account. And of course, I did make sure he got the refund for it. ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-01,"AITA for canceling an Amazon order?

142,1eh9g34,"AITA for ""forcing"" my friends to get me a gift for my birthday celebration?","I (17m) am turning 18 this year, I don't know how it is in other countries, but in Germany here it's a pretty big deal for some people since you're allowed to drink all alcohol and become an adult.

I don't usually celebrate due to my birthday being in the middle of summer break here (27th August), and most of my friends being on vacation by then. That means I don't get the bare minimum ""happy birthday"" texts from most people either, and even when I try to celebrate after summer break, I feel like it always was seen as just another ""hangout"" or something, and they never get me any gifts either. 

I never was mad about this, since I was just happy enough cause they hung out with me at all. But this year is my 18th birthday, I don't want it to be another meaningless day. I plan on celebrating the week after summer break with all of my friends and I've been making it pretty clear that I want gifts, and If they're not gonna get me one they might as well just not show up.

I mean, I've always given my friends gifts, even for Christmas when it was unnecessary just cause I like giving gifts. I don't have all the money in the world of course, but I always tried thinking of a creative gift they would like, and not some gift card or money cause I think that's lazy, unless they ask for it but even then I try to think of a second gift I can give them.
I know I'm not supposed to expect anything back cause that seems greedy, but at some point it really hurts when your friends constantly forget about your birthday and stuff. Like why can't they do the same for me?

I even told my mom this recently, and she was super baffled cause she always thought my friends got me something even when I didn't celebrate my birthday. The most I ever got were some keychains 2 years ago (which I really love, don't get me wrong) and some manga 4 years ago. I don't read manga🧍but it's the thought that counts?

Most of the time they tell me some ""I'm not good at gifts"" excuse like ??? All of my friends know what I like cause I yap about things I like all the time, it can't be that hard. This year I got a pretty big gift box for my friend (19f) and she said ""well if you got me this, then I guess I need to get you something for your birthday too"" so she wouldn't have gotten me anything if I didn't give her something?

Pretty much I'm asking if I'm the asshole, cause I feel bad for ""forcing"" them to buy me something but I don't wanna have another sad birthday this year that doesn't feel special. Like I've never had a classic birthday party where everyone gives me gifts or anything, I wanna experience that too.

Admittedly I’m not a great kicker and I’ve been in a funk but I’m not the worst person on the team. Two nights before him and I were both drunk and I told him I would consider not kicking because I knew he would bring it up to me, like he did last year. That night I also told him I was going to kick the ball around at my job with some of the residents at the group home I work at the next day and I would get back to him on his confident I was.

150,1eh83ip,AITA for making my coworker mad by giving a homeless man a bracelet,"hello reddit community, for some brief context, i (20f) have worked with this friend (19m) for the past three years. our talking to each other depends on if im working or not because i don’t work there when i am in college but come back over summers. to give some more background, he has confessed his feelings before and i friendzoned him, but to keep the peace at work we’re friends. we talk to each other a lot and communicate outside of work, but i’ve done my best to set some pretty clear boundaries. 

around the pizza place i work at there’s been this homeless hippie gay guy (30ish m) walkin around and he would come in for a slice every once in a while. I see him on other roads close by so he’s and he wanders around but he just keeps to himself and doesn’t bother anyone.
 
a couple days ago i saw him sitting outside in a grassy patch in the parking lot when i got to work and went up to him and asked if he wanted some slices of pizza to be nice. he asked me what my name was, we chatted outside and had a really good conversation, i felt like i truly saw him and he saw me for a second and while it was some hippie philosophical stuff to be talking about on a first interaction i never felt threatened, unsafe, or unaware. i went in the store and gave him his pizza, we had another chat when i was off and then i went home. 

i told my friend about my interaction and from the getgo he was being judgemental of the situation and what i was doing.
 next day i was chatting with my friend and i brought up how i made a bracelet for my new friend and wanted to give it to him if i saw him that day at work. he had a problem again about it and i explained that i felt like i was doing a good thing and that i can handle myself and know when im safe and that i appreciated his concern. convo was dropped. 

later in the night im chatting with him after work and i told him how i saw my friend again and gave him the bracelet. he brought up again how he thinks im unsafe and this is a bad idea. 
at this point im getting pissed because i’ve told him several times now that i feel safe and i don’t see an issue with what im doing and that i don’t need his help. 

we get into a huge fight when he calls me “stupid and naive” not to mention that he is friends with a girl i really don’t like from highschool i used to be friends with, who he texted about me, the situation, and how stupid and naive i was being. she responded in her usual bitchy way which doesnt bother me because its expected, but shows me a lot about he thinks and feels about me. 

i feel like he showed how he really felt and thinks about me as “stupid woman” which i told him. he then sent me a lame apology response to which i responded with “not the victim mom line text, please stop” and we haven’t texted since then. i have the privilege of going back to college in two weeks and kind of escape the situation, but am i the asshole?

151,1eh80qo,"AITA for telling my son ""good job"" after he cussed out a neighbor over a birthday gift?","My 11yo son Landon is a bit quirky in how he acts and sometimes dresses. His best friend is a girl and they like painting each other's toe nails. Hos favorite sweater is a Princess Toadstool hoodie. He's also a very affectionate kid who doesn't mind if dad still hugs and kisses him in public.

This month we had a new neighbor, Jen,, move in and she is a middle school teacher who is going to be teaching at Landon's school. She really made an effort to become friendly with the block. 

Last week we had a surprise party for Landon and Jen begged if she could come. She said it sounded really fun and wanted to get to know more families. We said sure. We also told people no presents. Landon already got enough (and he knows it) but they could donate supplies to the local animal shelter from a wishlist Landon created.

The party was winding down and Jen said she got Landon a special present for a special kid. She then said no matter who you love, you are loved. What did she give him? A pride flag. He was humiliated beyond belief and speechless.

He said he didn't want it and went i to my room and locked the door. I told Jen that her present was inappropriate, icky and insulting. I told her to leave. I went to talk to Landon and he was so angry and embarrassed.

Last night Jen said she cried thinking that she ruined my son's party and wanted to apologize. I spoke to Landon and he agreed to listen to her. She said what we predicted she would say - ""I meant no harm so it's not my fault and it upset me that I upset you so you should be comforting me.""

I told Landon he could tell Jen anything he wanted and I wasn't going to stop him. He said first off he's not gay and she was wrong to make people think that he was. Yes, you'd think Landon was gay but, no, he isn't. I am his dad. I know. He gave back her gift and called a couple of bad names. She said she wasn't going to be spoken to that way and I told my son that this is the part where she plays the victim and wants you to say sorry. He called her another bad word and told her to leave and don't ever talk to him or his family again including our dog. 

Was she genuinely sorry? A little bit not enough. Her virtue signaling was stronger than her remorse though.

I, 23f, and my boyfriend, 21m, have been dating for 5 months. The first issue came in several instances of him asking me to throw trash away out of his car. This, in itself, is such a small task and one I would do gladly. But, it became increasingly annoying and upsetting when I was constantly the only one doing so at his request, and certain situations making me uncomfortable. For example, it would be night time and he would pull up to a dumpster at a random establishment whilst it being dark and ask me repeatedly to throw cups out from his car until I give in, ignoring my vocal discomfort and safety concerns. Most of the time, he would not drive away until I gave in and did as he requested so it would turn into a huge argument. This was a constant thing. When I would express my discomfort, he would call me crazy/psychotic for overreacting over simply throwing away trash. A big breaking point for this issue was one day when I was late to work and he locked his car doors preventing me from entering until I threw away some trash for him. I told him after this that we needed to take a break. My mindset was that he was showing signs of being this controlling, even though this is such a minor thing like throwing trash out, it did not bode well for what was to come in the  remainder of our relationship. Moving on, we have been staying at his parents’ home when I come over because he is on break from college. To add a little bit more context to what I'm about to say, his dad is a pilot and I have heard him state multiple times that he doesn't mind buying food for us. We were hungry and he asked his mom if we could use his dad’s card to order pizza, she said yes as long as he asked his sister if she wanted chicken wings from this place. He made a big deal out of this and was refusing to even consider her until I made him ask her. The three of us got together and she suggested ordering two 8 pc of the wings, which I agreed with. He replied firmly saying only one even though she, and I, wanted two. We were all 4 sharing one pizza, so logically this made sense. He stood his ground and refused to do so saying it would be too expensive, even though it wasn’t his money we were using. Fast forward to time to pickup the food, I told him I wasn’t going with him and that he could go by himself since he wanted to be so controlling over the food situation. We argued back in forth. He ended up telling me to go home. I live an hour away, but I did not fight him.

When I called him in the morning, I kinda implied that I'm upset at him but he was very clueless about why I was angry and why he should wish me today, and it just made me so much more upset. I disconnected and refused to tell him why I was upset. Then I went on Instagram and saw all my friends wishing their girlfriends publicly and that did not help at all.

157,1eh7hg8,AITA for speaking my opinion in my parents' argument? ,"I (15F) live with my parents and sister. Last week, my parents had an argument over my mom's job application. My dad didn't express any enthusiasm for this job, and my mom didn't appreciate that. My mom also only told him about the application today. When my dad was silent and showed no enthusiasm for my mom, she looked so sad. She was going on and on about how excited she was only for him to just leave the room. 
I won't go into specifics, but basically, I added in my opinion: my mom should receive support from my dad, and my mom should ask for his opinion more often. They both seemed appreciative of my opinion (especially my mom), and I felt the conversation ended earlier than if I had not intervened. I'm not sure why I spoke up, especially because when my parents *seldom* argue, my sister and I let them argue alone. In that moment of their argument, I felt strongly about something and felt it should be said. I have no idea if I helped them, though.

 After their conversation ended, my sister (12F) talked to me in another room. She tells me I shouldn't have said anything. I felt I had an opinion and wanted to express it, but she told me it was better for me to talk to her instead. I said that would ""be like talking to a wall"" because it does nothing, and she seemed a little offended. She also said my talk with both of them was biased towards my mom since ""she counted how many times I vouched for both sides."" Sure, my opinion was biased, but it seemed for good reason. I wasn't sure what more could've been said for my dad. To be fair, I did defend my dad a little, so I wasn't fully turning against him. I'm still not sure if I did the right thing.

158,1eh7ao1,AITA - Am I the asshole for being 5 minutes late on a bad day?,"I have a friend (let's call her Lynne) who is going through hard times. Her husband had a mental breakdown and I have been trying to be supportive by checking in on her, offering to babysit her daughter (8f) and catching up for coffee for her to vent.   
  
About three months ago, Lynne asked me to babysit her daughter for the day while she took her husband to a medical appointment. I was of course fine with this, but mentioned that we'd be out and about that day as my mum was visiting from interstate. She was okay for her daughter to join us (I have two kids 8f, 6m) and I promised to drop her home when we were done.   
  
Closer to the end of the day, the kids were hungry so we picked up some takeaway. I texted her to say that I'd drop her daughter home at 5pm. The kids ate and had a play while I chatted to my mum and a friend at our place. Time got away and I realised it was 5:05pm - oops. I texted her to apologise that we were running late. She responded by asking where we were and then followed up by saying that she'd come and pick her daughter up. This is where it gets messy.  
  
On arrival, Lynne stormed into our house, completely ignored us all and commanded that her daughter leave at once. She gave me and my mum death stares and said ""You were meant to drop her home!"" before she left.

In the following months, the coldness and death stares continued to the point where I no longer felt comfortable at the thought of being in her presence. I was shocked and hurt by the continuing malice and cruelty, and eventually decided that I just had to let it go because it was affecting me mentally.

The catch is - my daughter (8f) and her daughter are best friends at school. They have been asking for play dates outside of school but I simply don't know how to navigate this. This week, the girls asked for a play date once again and her husband agreed to it happily... I said I was unsure and didn't want to impose. Lynne has now texted as if nothing has happened, asking if I want to organise a time and day for a play date. WTF? I don't even know how to respond.

TLDR:   
Am I the asshole because I was late on a bad day? I want my daughter to have time with her friend but not so keen to keep the friendship with the mother. How do I navigate this?

I live on my own and have my job that gets me by as an Amazon driver. If you’re not familiar, being a delivery driver is tough work, especially in the heat. Well this past week was Prime Week which basically doubled our workload(but not our pay) for that week. 

My Father and my Stepmother live together at their own home out in the country area and will often ask me to come out there and mow the lawn, work on the roof, lift furniture, etc. I always come down to help them out and they always pay me for the work even though I try to decline every time because that’s how they are. The money can be helpful sometimes if I’m ever in a bind but I never ask them to do it whenever I go over to help with whatever they need. 

They also have a lot of land, it takes about 4 straight hours to mow it and that’s if you go non-stop to blitz through it.

Well this past week I worked four 11hr shifts in a row(due to prime week) and was exhausted. My Stepmother sent me a text asking for me to come over and mow the lawn or if I rather not she could hire the kid down the road to do it instead. Due to me being worn out and sore and would like to spend time relaxing the day she was asking, I said that I’d elect to sit this one out to which she replied with “Ok”.

Fast forward to today I get a text saying how she and my Dad were disappointed in me for not coming over to help and that I’ve been ungrateful to them. This rubbed me the wrong way and basically explained how I’ve been helping them out for months every time they’ve asked but the ONE time I say no I’m the bad guy? I told her to get off her high-horse.

She didn’t like that so she says that I’ve “burned my bridge” with her and to never come to the house again. I sent a text to my Dad about it and to call me later. He calls me up and says that he’s disappointed in me for not coming over to help and that I was disrespectful to my stepmother(our relationship is rocky at best and we buttheads a lot but recently we were doing ok till now) so she’s really pissed at me and my Dad had to mow the lawn himself because the kid down the street was busy. I told my Dad that she gave me two options and I chose one of them.

165,1eh5q9e,AITA for expecting my friends to compensate me for them cancelling our planned trip?,"I (25F) and my two friends (25F) have known each other for 20 and 17 years. Let's call them ""Lauren"" and ""Rachel"". We used to be really close growing up but now are pretty different people. I still see them every once in a while but I have become the more outgoing and adventurous of the group. 

About a month ago, the idea of a beach trip was introduced by Lauren. She wanted to keep the trip closer so we planned to travel 1.5 hours from where we live. I found a nice AirBnB for us to stay at and the cost of the reservation ended up being about $1,000. Rachel currently has no income so the cost was not going on her card. Lauren said that she could do it but it might be a bit difficult and would need to move money around. 

Before booking I asked multiple times are we sure this date works for us and are we sure this is where we want to stay. Everyone agreed it was what was happening. I booked the trip on my card and was told I would be paid back from Lauren after the next paycheck. I told Rachel if she needed to pay me in increments she could. 

I told them multiple times in person and over text that we had 48 hours to cancel the trip in order to get the full refund. 

About a week later Rachel texts and says she needs to go to the American Girl Doll Restaurant that weekend and can no longer go. This is a whole different frustration... but she was out. Since Rachel wasn't going Lauren decided she wasn't going to go. Lauren basically has no excuse for not going especially because it is only 1.5 hours away. I offered multiple options (bringing another person, bringing our BFs, Rachel only going one night, etc.) but they wanted nothing to do with it.

At this point cancelling the reservation was going to only give us about $450 back, costing us about $550 for not going on a trip! Per AirBnB policy, if you do not cancel within 48hrs you get refunded 50% of each day booked and the cleaning fee no matter if you cancel 49 hours after the reservation or a week before the booked date.

Instead of losing everything I kept the reservation in hopes I would find people to come with me. I asked basically everyone I could think of that would go with me and no one was able to come. 

In the end my BF happily agrees to come and I was able to get another friend to join. HOWEVER at this point I dont feel it is appropriate to ask full value from my BF and friend who was not involved in this booking. I feel that Rachel and Lauren should compensate me some amount (not the full amount they were going to pay me) for canceling this trip on me. I'm basically going to be paying $800 for this trip because they bailed on me. 

AITA for expecting them to pay me some money for doing this to me?

**Side note: we went on vacation last year and similar stuff happened where I booked us an airbnb and all of a sudden we couldn't stay there anymore for whatever reason.

166,1eh5ieu,AITA for wanting my roommate's gf to stop squatting at our house? ,"My boyfriend and I have gotten in several arguments about this. He seems to have no problem with the fact that our mutual roommate's girlfriend (who's filthy rich by the way), has been living in our house for the past 7/8 months. For free. She has her own house; she's just never there. She lets herself in every day, which I don't like, as I'm a very private person. She parks in our driveway and complains to her boyfriend when I park behind her or when I don't park far up enough to accommodate her car, even though we have overflow parking, and I actually pay rent to live here. She and my roommate have taken our cats outside without asking us, they've left the back door cracked allowing one of our cats to escape, they don't remember to close the door to the basement, where there are regularly open pill bottles and unknown substances on the floor, and they're both just lazy slobs in general.

Whenever this girl is at my house, she and my roommate order or make food, leave everything out on the counter/in the sink or in the fridge, and never touch it again. The amount of black mold I've found in our fridge is disgusting and infuriating. I've tried to ask my roommate to clean up after himself more, but nothing happens, and it gets worse when his girlfriend is here.

The main issues I have are concerns for the safety of my cats, with the basement and back doors being left open, as well as food being left out for days on end (I do the dishes frequently, but I also work full time so I can't control it all the time), and the fact that this girl is essentially squatting in our house. I work my ass off to afford rent, which we all know isn't cheap these days, and it seems disrespectful for someone to live here for free, especially when they don't contribute or clean up after themselves at all.

It's to the point where I get genuinely get stressed and irritable whenever she's around (so all the time). I don't trust her or my roommate around my cats, and I know I have to consistently clean up after them. Oh yeah, and she and my roommate have broken up 3/4 times in the past month and keep getting back together and regularly get in screaming matches, creating an incredibly stressful environment for everyone.

168,1eh50l4,AITA for trying to hire my ex's ex for gig work?,"Me (30f) and my ex (39M, let’s call him Gary) broke up 5 months ago. We started dating because we run in similar professional circles, although not the same company or field. Before we got together, Gary recommended a designer (we’ll call her Linda) for some of our projects. While Linda would typically be too expensive for us, she did some pro bono work to break into our industry, which is impact driven. She declined being paid more, saying she was happy to be doing meaningful work. Her work was INCREDIBLE. With very little direction she built entire projects that were beautiful and meticulous. We also got along super well, and the work she did has been unparalleled by people we pay more for today.

Back to t-1 year ago. Gary and I were dating, and I mentioned Linda’s work. I thanked him for rec, and said that I wanted to hire her again. Gary became very upset by this because unbeknownst to me, he and Linda had been dating on/off for 6 years when he made the referral. He told stories before about his ex before that sounded intense – but I had no idea it was Linda. He said he was uncomfortable with me working with her and I took this to heart. When she reached out asking for more work, I let the email pass me by.

Gary and I split up about 6 months after that. We were “cordial” since we ran into one another for work, but only ever talked only if it was needed. I found out later that Gary told mutual colleagues about our breakup, and painted me in a very negative and untrue light, which damaged a few relationships. With this new context, I didn’t think Linda was the monster she was made out to be by Gary. 

 So, we get to today. I was working on some old materials and came across Linda’s work. There were a few incomplete items that I thought would be perfect for our current project. I figured she probably didn’t know that I even dated Gary, and this was in a professional context, so I didn’t see the harm when I sent an email to see if she was free.

An hour after, I had a text message from Gary containing a SCREENSHOT of the email that I sent to Linda. This weirded me out and I thought it was a breach of privacy. He was pissed, saying that reaching out was inappropriate, psychopathic, and that I went behind his back. To me, the statute of limitations on hiring Linda expired when the relationship did, I felt I gave it enough buffer for decency, and she can make her own decisions without Gary getting involved. However, since it’s clear I struck a nerve, so I sent Linda a “Sorry! Let’s just drop it!” email. I haven’t heard anything from her yet, but I’ll update if I do.

So AITA in trying to hire her after I dated her ex? I find Gary’s reaction feels immature, but maybe it was inconsiderate to ask her, especially if they’re back together/on speaking terms?

For context: my ex was never an anime fan, in April I had asked him to go to a con and do a couple cosplay together and he made excuses on why he didn’t want to go (too much people, him not liking anime, him not knowing the characters, him having OCD, him not trusting stuff from China?) and that I have to learn to do things I like by myself. Valid reasons, I was salty but I accepted it and never went to the con since I had no one to go with. I could’ve gone by myself but it’s lonely going to a con alone.

He is not really the jealous type, it's just this ""joke"" that he makes all the time. He was cheated on in this past and I'm not sure this is related to that.

Obviously I told him that this hurts my feelings and that I would never cheat on him and how I don't like him speaking to me like this, even if to him it's ""just a joke"".


He thinks I'm overreacting when I get upset.
AITA?

Edit: when we fight like this he often tries to cuddle or kiss and I just shut him off. He rarely apologizes as he ""was just joking"" - just tries to win me over again with some sweet talk.",0.0,0.006211434490978718,0,1

174,1eh4211,AITAH for not moving states after my mother in law died,"I (35f) have been with my husband (34m) for 12 years, married for 9. We live in the state that I am from, in my hometown, where the majority of my family live. I have 3 children, from a previous relationship, so not biologically my husband’s, but he is very close with them. He’s been there most of their lives, especially my youngest two. His family live a few states away (about 500 miles). We have always visited often and they come to our home as often as they can, we both work and my in-laws are retired. I love my in-laws, they’ve always welcomed my kids and I with open arms. Six months ago, my mother in law passed away, very tragically and unexpectedly. My father in law was understandably distraught and became very depressed. My husband and I discussed it and decided he should go stay with his dad for a while to help him through my mother in laws passing and get his mental health back on track. After a few weeks with his dad, we discovered that my in laws were hiding financial trouble and that FIL wouldn’t be able to make it on his own financially with just his income, in his current living situation. Of course we immediately offered to move him into our home, where he could get back on his feet and recover financially and decide what to do from there, or he could stay indefinitely. We just wanted to support him. However, he is stubborn and views his home and a sacred space that he shared with my late MIL and refuses to leave it. The problem is my husband is now providing financial support in order to keep him from losing the house. He has become financially and emotionally dependent on my husband and feels like he can’t make it if my husband comes back home. 

So, my husband proposed the idea that we relocate together to his hometown to be with his dad. I love my husband and his dad. I also have a life and obligations here. I have a career that I’ve spent 20 years building. A career that pays OUR bills. A career with a company that wouldn’t be transferable there. Moving there would likely mean a six figure pay cut. However, money isn’t everything and I’d be open to a discussion if it were just about money. But, my children are deeply rooted in their schools, community extra curricular activities, and their biological father is here. He and I have always agreed to stay close (distance-wise) for the sake of the children. So, for these reasons, I cannot justify prioritizing my FIL’s sentimental attachment to a house and relocating my family. I do, however, need my husband to prioritize OUR family and come back home. I feel guilty for asking him to choose, so I haven’t. I know the sudden loss of his mother makes him feel the need to take care of his father. But after six months, if his father is unwilling to budge when we have offered to allow him to move into our home to extend our continued support, I need him to decide it’s time to come back home.

176,1eh3wxv,AITA for not having a “cheat meal” at my friend’s birthday dinner?,"I’m F24, fitness/wellness is important to me. I eat mostly whole foods and aim for a more natural diet, but it can vary. I also have Celiac so I have to eat gluten free.



My longtime friend Mia is very much the opposite and loves more processed foods. 



What bothers me is that she’s made it clear that she looks down upon people who prioritize healthier eating and exercise in their lives. She’s dialed her comments back because I did have a talk with her a while ago about how I don’t disrespect her lifestyle choices, but she still says things about it more than I’d like, it’s just not directed at me anymore.



We’ve talked about our mindsets before and basically Mia finds all exercise to be extremely uncomfortable/painful and has a hard time understanding that to me it feels good, so she thinks I’m putting myself through pain in the gym. She finds a lot of healthy foods unappetizing and thinks I’m forcing myself to eat foods I don’t like. Another thing is Mia doesn’t recognize/understand the actual health benefits and things fitness is primarily about appearance, so essentially she thinks I’m putting myself through agony simply for the sake of looks, and she thinks it’s not mentally healthy to do so (she has made subtle remarks hinting about ortho).



Mia likes to try to “tempt” me with foods that just aren’t really appealing to me, and she gets upset if/when I turn it down or go with a healthier option. She even got visibly down once when we went to get froyo and I topped mine with fruit instead of candy. I’ll give her credit as well that she’s toned down her reactions to stuff like that since our talk but there’s still a noticeable shift in energy whenever it happens. I just brush it off at this point.



Recently we went out with a group of friends for Mia’s birthday to an Italian place. I got chicken marsala which is one of my favorite dishes and was soooo good. Mia talked to me after the fact and said that she was extremely disappointed that I couldn’t have set my “lifestyle” aside for her birthday. She expected me to get (gluten free) pasta or pizza. She claimed I was being selfish and putting my “mentally unhealthy” choices above our friendship.



I told her I literally prefer chicken marsala to pasta and it’s none of her business what I eat or why I eat it. It kept escalating until I said I’ll just never eat around her again if my food preferences upset her that much, and then she accused me of threatening to go on a hunger strike. I clarified that I still plan on eating the same amount and types of foods, just not when she’s around. She’s extremely upset about the whole interaction and maintains that I could’ve just put my “diet” aside for one night.



I’m at a point where I kind of wish I’d just gotten a pasta bc I do love pasta too so I would have enjoyed the meal plus it would’ve avoided all this drama. Knowing Mia I should’ve seen it coming and could’ve adjusted my choices accordingly. AITA?
