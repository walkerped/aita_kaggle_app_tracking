It doesn't even sound different) and because it is foreign from the country my dad is from (which it isn't we have Oskar here as a totally normal name plus.. my dad is from that country. It would be totally ok to be named a name from his country. Oz it more commen there than here). And that she just woll call me [Deadname] no matter what.

I don't wanna go to visit them anymore. I just don't want to. Not until they call me Ozkar or just stop deadnaming me.

Now to the problem: my ex isn't alloud to go anywhere with the children, without me or a professional.
The greatgrandparents of my children can't drive anymore. It isn't nearby so they can't go by bus or train because of there age. I could go with the children for two or three nights a year or something. But I just don't want to sleep there or even be at their house.

My children never ask to see them but they are their great grandparents and would like to see their great grandchildren.

So WIBTA if I don't go to visit them with my children (until they stop deadnaming me, which probably won't happen)?

There where other things too, like they inplied if my ex wanted to come at the same time (which I wouldn't even ask my ex) we could all sleep in the guestroom. As I would allow my children to sleep in the same room like my ex... After my ex wanted to burn down the house we all were in when hallucinating because not being able to sleep. I wouldn't even sleep in the same house anymore.
But nothing that would be a problem if I say we won't come in this case.

1,1ehexlf,WIBTA if I said I wasn’t comfortable about a group fancy dress idea?,"I (19F) am part of a friendly camping group with my family and a few other families. Every year we attend a small local camper van event with a themed costume party. Usually we are voted best dressed as we are a large group who are able to put a lot of time into our costumes. It is also a very jokey event and isn’t super serious. The overall theme this year is Kings and Queens. Last time I saw the group the ideas ranged from Knights of the Round table to Monty Python and the Holy Grail. But without consulting my family, some of the others decided on the theme of drag, which I found out this morning from my mum. 

I am the only person (who I know of) who is queer in the group but I am not trans nor do I do drag, and most of the group (my friends and the event) consists of Gen X people, with one of the dads (I’ll call him Mark) having a bit of a habit of saying things that have made me uncomfortable in the past (lowkey homophobic, transphobic and racist jokes). I would suspect that the entire thing is his idea as he is best friends with the mother from the family (I’ll call her Tina) who organises the costumes, and she tends to be a bit of a pushover as she hates upsetting people. One of the kids (18M) has performed in Kinky Boots in drag but is not queer and I haven’t had the chance to talk to him about it, which is the only experience that anyone in the group has with drag that I know of.

I worry that they will take the theme too far, start doing offensive stuff and portray really harmful stereotypes. My gut reaction was that the idea could become offensive really quickly with some of the people involved. The whole dress up event is supposed to be super comedic and I think that this particular theme isn’t suitable as it portrays real experiences in a current community which in an already difficult time for LGBTQ+ people like myself. But at the same time, I’m barely an adult and not super close to anyone in the group like some of the others are. I could cause fallouts or argument within the group which could result in my family getting kicked out if Mark gets in a really nasty mood about it. Tina had good intentions but has had trouble standing up to Mark in the past which has resulted in a family leaving the group before. 

I raised my concerns with my mum (55F) and sister (16F). My sister brushed me aside and said that there was nothing wrong with it and I could just not participate. My mum said that she could suggest other themes to the group like playing cards or something. I was also told that my Dad hasn’t been told about the theme and I know that he would be very uncomfortable with dressing up in a drag.

Would I be TA if I raised the issue further with the rest of the group, which could potentially cause a rift in the group and get my family kicked out?

2,1eheq0g,"AITA for refusing to share my recipe w gf's family, and tearing into them abt neglecting her?","To clarify, my girlfriend is trans, which is why I could almost carry a child. She's only in contact with her uncle Rob, his wife Jen, their son, and her grandma. I got along with them until they kidnapped my girlfriend while I was in hospital. They live on the outskirts of a city, with no public transport access unless they drive her to the city centre. It was their son's birthday and I convinced my girlfriend to go, I felt bad she was stuck in the hospital w me. From the hospital it was only a 1 hour bus trip, and she said she'd only be there for a couple hours. I had suffered from a miscarriage, i was kept overnight for monitoring. They wouldn't drive her to the bus stop, forcing her to stay overnight. They knew why i was in the hospital, but ""family comes first."" so, i know where i stand.

Afterwards, we decided to limit contact and only respond if they reached out. We recently moved into a new house, and they asked to visit. We declined, but they're very persistent. Since everyone in the family went to culinary school, I cooked something simple—my nan’s steak with bourbon garlic cream sauce. Rob liked it and asked for the recipe, but I didn't really want to share my family heirloom recipe, so i playfully said, ""It's mostly love."" Rob started yelling at me, and accused me of fearing he'd show me up since he went to culinary school, and my girlfriend wouldn't rely on me anymore. I asked who else she could rely on, he did not like that, and got louder.

I reminded him they could have taken her out of an abusive home anytime but chose not to, because they didn't want to go near her mother. they chose spite over protecting their own nieces and nephews. I said she was forced to rely on me, because they weren't there. She was removed from her home, and put in with a foster family, separated from her siblings and then when the foster family moved, she had to live with my parents. i was 16. she had to move in with her 16 year old girlfriend.

3,1ehbe62,AITA for just wanting to leave without saying a word?,"Story's like this. I'm 35 MTF, Partner is 43 F and chronically Ill with Fybromyalgia, Autism,  thyroid disorder.  
Met and partner met over 15 years ago and I joined her already Poly relationship, although person 3 left. 2 Years ago I met someone in an MMO called Final FantasyXIV, and after talking with my current partner I got the OK. We've been dating for a year now. 

Point is I probably started feeling things for my other partner because current partner really made me feel horrid in hindsight. Her illness has made it so I basically do everything around the house next to my 32 hour job. I come home, cook, help take care of the pets. And until recently I made her breakfast every day, give her water, drive her to her ""Job"" (she makes art once a week and posts it on social media, her income is from disability.

Partner was initially against my transition to a woman, but said it was ok because ""we needed eachother.""  
Recently I sorta snapped, and we called a friend, we talked things over and said my partner should be more self sufficient, aka, get her own water (instead of whatsapping me she needs it and getting mad if I don't answer in 5 mins). This is hard on her she said. And anything big happening puts her in a meltdown. 

I appreciate she's willing to try but me having to hug her and her constantly telling me I can't leave her alone is emotionally draining me. I tried telling her but she keeps twisting at to the point I'm telling her I am not leaving and I love her, but honestly I don't. I wish her well, but her constantly asking me if I still love her, telling me she's helpless without me makes me just wanna run away. 

Other partner lives on the other side of the planet, I am not running to another woman who accepts me. I just want to do my job and get a small apartment and relax after work instead of spending time with my current partner playing boardgames, to hear 2 hours later it wasn't enough.

4,1eh7muc,AITA Monthly Open Forum August 2024: Remembering Assholes,"# Keep things civil. Rules still apply.

Let’s do a little spin on our “tell us about a time you were the asshole” deal from a couple of months back. But this time, let’s remember the assholes we’ve lost. I mean that in the best way possible. To be clear, this is not intended to be a “let’s shit on the dead” type of thing. If you want to rant and rave about someone whose grave you’d rather piss on, I’m sure there’s a sub for that.

What we’d like to see here is something about an asshole in your life that you’ve lost. But, you think back on them fondly and smile. Even when thinking about some of their asshole ways. I know I certainly have someone like that. And I do miss them. Even with their assholery, I’d much rather have them here.

So, tell us about that asshole that’s moved on. As we've done in the past, some sub rules can be relaxed a little. For example, it’s OK if your tale involves a relationship. But, we still cannot host anything that mentions violence.

6,1eh3aag,WIBTA? Skipping coworkers funeral?,"My coworker had passed away over the weekend & today was her service. Now I wouldn’t consider this coworker and I super close, but I did know her. We worked together often, she was my superior and we would talk often on our shifts, gossiping and messing around. (We work in healthcare, nightshift).  I would have considered her someone I really liked at work and enjoyed seeing us on the same shift together. However, I had only known her for a year and a lot of my other colleagues have known her for 5+, so that being said, I knew her the least. There is a group of them that are all very close and tight knit that ended up planning on attending the service together then going out for dinner and I was not invited. I was a bit upset by this but tried not to take it too to heart because in all fairness, I only know all of them on a surface level basis and vice versa, so I understood why I wasn’t included, it’d probably be weird if I was. But it got me in my head thinking, is it even appropriate for me to go to the service? Do i still pay my respects? Or is it inappropriate because I didnt know her through and through or for that long? I dont know, I am a chronic overthinker. I had donated some money towards the family and signed a card along with some other coworkers too, maybe thats enough?
Anyways, I intended on going to the service after the group of them had gone and when I got there I got really bad anxiety and left. Now I am filled with guilt about not attending and feel awful. I am beating myself up for letting my anxiety and insecurities dictate this because it isnt about me. AITA for overthinking and being selfish or is it not that extreme? 
There is another service tomorrow morning for an hour right before the funeral but I figured that one was more intimate for family.

7,1eh31ni,AITAH if I want to elope?,"Key context points are:

-fiancees mom has not liked me since day 1 before she even met me
-his mother threatened him if we were to elope
- we recently got a house and his mom has been trying to make it hers since he's her sun
-his mother crosses boundaries and can never say nothing good about me no matter what.
-just had a house warming party and his mother made it all about her told everyone what to bring when we spent a couple hundred buying food for guests (honestly didn't need anything else food wise) that and made sure people knew that her gift was for my fiancee not us both.
-i am constantly attacked and just sick of the narcissistic behavior not only towards me but him too

On to the story. I 26 f and my 25 m fiance (Zeke)
Got engaged last year November. After after seeing all of the prices of how much a wedding costs, I knew it wasn't meant for us. We are both introverts and we both shy away from the spotlight so a wedding would not be ideal for us. But his family continues to want us to have a big elaborate wedding because we have been together for almost 9 years now. I would rather spend the money on a trip just for the two of us. 

 So I want to elope or do a courthouse wedding. But after everything that his mother puts me through, I only want it to be us. I don't want his family there and I'm not much of a family person myself. That is the back story in itself as my parents got a divorce and it was very messy. My so-called Father has turned my family against me and I have not heard from them in years. 

About a year ago my grandmother passed that was on my dad's side. I went to her funeral. Being there brought back so many. I told his mother that it was not a good experience for me.

Any happy moment that me and my fiance share She has to ruin it by bringing up my family and asking if they will come. I have not told her the whole story as she does not deserve to know my truth. 

There is so many things that she has said about me that truly hurt me. I try to be a great person and not let it get to me but at the end of the day I just want her to like me. She is the love of my life's mother. 

After our housewarming our house was trashed. Many people including his mom wore their shoes on our white carpet. And we decided to rip the carpet up as we spent 6 hours the day prior to clean for the party. The carpet was so disgusting that we had to. 

Months prior his mother paid about $90 to get it professionally cleaned for us as we were moving in. His mother called her sister to complain that we got rid of our carpet and it was Zeke's fault that she wore her shoes on the white carpet. And we had no right to get rid of it. 

I want to have a courthouse wedding with just the two of us and nobody else. I feel like it is the best decision for us. He says that he wants to give me the wedding of my dreams. But honestly all I want is to just marry him. I would be happy to just wear a white dress at McDonald's if it meant marrying him. 

So am I the asshole if we decide to get married alone? ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-01,"AITAH if I want to elope? Key context points are:

-fiancees mom has not liked me since day 1 before she even met me
-his mother threatened him if we were to elope
- we recently got a house and his mom has been trying to make it hers since he's her sun
-his mother crosses boundaries and can never say nothing good about me no matter what.
-just had a house warming party and his mother made it all about her told everyone what to bring when we spent a couple hundred buying food for guests (honestly didn't need anything else food wise) that and made sure people knew that her gift was for my fiancee not us both.
-i am constantly attacked and just sick of the narcissistic behavior not only towards me but him too

On to the story. I 26 f and my 25 m fiance (Zeke)
Got engaged last year November. After after seeing all of the prices of how much a wedding costs, I knew it wasn't meant for us. We are both introverts and we both shy away from the spotlight so a wedding would not be ideal for us. But his family continues to want us to have a big elaborate wedding because we have been together for almost 9 years now. I would rather spend the money on a trip just for the two of us. 

 So I want to elope or do a courthouse wedding. But after everything that his mother puts me through, I only want it to be us. I don't want his family there and I'm not much of a family person myself. That is the back story in itself as my parents got a divorce and it was very messy. My so-called Father has turned my family against me and I have not heard from them in years. 

About a year ago my grandmother passed that was on my dad's side. I went to her funeral. Being there brought back so many. I told his mother that it was not a good experience for me.

Any happy moment that me and my fiance share She has to ruin it by bringing up my family and asking if they will come. I have not told her the whole story as she does not deserve to know my truth. 

There is so many things that she has said about me that truly hurt me. I try to be a great person and not let it get to me but at the end of the day I just want her to like me. She is the love of my life's mother. 

After our housewarming our house was trashed. Many people including his mom wore their shoes on our white carpet. And we decided to rip the carpet up as we spent 6 hours the day prior to clean for the party. The carpet was so disgusting that we had to. 

Months prior his mother paid about $90 to get it professionally cleaned for us as we were moving in. His mother called her sister to complain that we got rid of our carpet and it was Zeke's fault that she wore her shoes on the white carpet. And we had no right to get rid of it. 

I want to have a courthouse wedding with just the two of us and nobody else. I feel like it is the best decision for us. He says that he wants to give me the wedding of my dreams. But honestly all I want is to just marry him. I would be happy to just wear a white dress at McDonald's if it meant marrying him.

8,1eh2wx1,AITA for gaining similar interests as my older brother?,"I (16F) have an older brother (18M). We used to be close when we were younger, but have grown apart. This is due to me living full time with our dad and step mom for three years and him living almost full time with our bio mom for nearly four year. When my brother got into PC's two years ago, he built his own. Last year, he offered to help me build my own by giving me his old PC glass case, keyboard, and other parts. I paid for one of the parts myself and am close to paying him back because he wasn't doing it for free, but gave me a discount. Now a few years ago, he started getting into motorcycles. Last November, he bought his own bike, which is really cool! I also casually started watching motovlogs and videos like that about a year ago too, but didnt get more interested until about March of this year. It just lurked in the back of my mind, like I would day dream and think about having my own, but the genuine interest didnt start until about a month ago. That was when he took me for a ride on his bike for the first time. It was super fun and exhilerating cause, not only did I get to spend time with him, but I got to go on a freaking MOTORCYCLE! I know I am prone to hyperfixating on things like different hobbies, shows, etc, so maybe this is one. Im just going to think about it some more and focus more on some interests I already enjoy like reading, music, and video games. I also dont want to get so focused and invested in motorcycles that, when I get one, I end up not liking it so much and then wasting a boat load of money. My step mom is very understanding of the situation and made another point that this might be me missing my brother because we were LITERALLY attatched at the hip when we were younger and this is my way of reaching out and wanting to spend time with him.

9,1eh2t8m,"AITA? I accidentally broke a sentimental object that was put in a hidden, dangerous place.","Am I the asshole and is the liability mine?

I accidentally broke a sentimental statue belonging to my housemate.

I was taking down hanging plants to get fresh soil. I asked if they wanted me to take down the plant in the stairwell, they said yes. 

While taking the plant off the hook, the plant dragged a statue off the window ledge that smashed on the landing.

My housemate wept and ran into their room, slamming the door.  The statue was an anniversary gift to him and his now dead spouse. It is also a numbered edition that was only made in one batch, several years ago.

I felt like absolute poo. He yelled that I had to replace it.  A couple days later he asked what I’m going to do about the statue.

Immediately following the crash, I collected every last shard and reached out to an old friend that restores art. He quoted me $800 to restore it to perfect, $400 to restore it to good. This is a significant discount, as we’re friends.

I’ve checked online for a replacement and the going prices are $450+.

I recently left my job because I’m moving out of the country, imminently. This is an exorbitant expense, especially with no income.

The statue was twice the size of the window ledge, hanging off substantially, and it was completely hidden behind the plant. I didn’t see it. I couldn’t have known it was there unless I was told or searched for it. 

To me, the sentiment warrants restoring the original, rather than buying a replacement. 
However, if it was so special, why would he put it precariously on a high window ledge, hidden behind a plant?

I empathize with my housemate, deeply, and if I were working, I’d replace it without question. Given the cost and my financial situation, it’s not an expense that I can casually afford. 

I was doing something to help my housemate, and it seems to me that the responsibility falls to him for putting it where/how it was. He knew it was there and said nothing about being careful removing that particular plant.

Does this make me the a-hole?
