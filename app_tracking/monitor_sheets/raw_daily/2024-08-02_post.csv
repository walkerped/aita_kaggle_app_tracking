0,1ei3hqu,AITA for bothering my girlfriend for praising another guy to me?,"Well, my girlfriend and I have been together for about a year and a half; We were always calm with each other, we never had such serious problems, except for one thing: her male friends who are extremely ""🧐"" and make me uncomfortable,

example: one of her friends (coincidence or not, he was into her ) I've said some shitty things about myself to her in relation to my gender (I'm transgender) So I told her I felt bad about it and she decided to block him, and in the meantime he sent her messages all the time crying like a child and I always said ""he thinks life is a strawberry, cry more you asshole"" (it was in vain because a few days later she unblocked him and today they are best friends again 🤡)

the most recent problem occurred on Monday when we were taking a walk together and she saw a friend she hadn't seen in a few months, so she went to say hello (so far so good), so I kept walking little by little while she talked to him until she came to me again, Then she came and said ""I haven't seen him in so long, wow he has such strong arms, my goodness""

So as I already gave up reacting, I decided to repeat what she said in other words (or not) on every occasion possible, because as she likes those ""strong arms😍"" I will torment her with them for a good few weeks. Maybe I'm being childish or an asshole, but it's been really fun to repeat her line with irony all the time.",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-08-02,"AITA for bothering my girlfriend for praising another guy to me?

1,1ehybve,AITA for refusing to visit my dad with cancer because I don’t want to see my stepmother?,"I (21, trans M) lived with my father and my stepmother basically since I was a little kid. My bio mom is mostly out of the picture due to me being removed from her care due to abuse, but I’ve been with my father and stepmother since I was fairly little so she basically raised me.

My stepmother gave me the basic needs a parent does, like housing and clothes and food, and she wasn’t always bad. But she started becoming more abusive when I hit middle school and it’s only gotten worse since. I feel like elaborating in the post itself would muddy the post and make it too long but I’m willing to elaborate in the comments or wherever. Not all of it was physical but it was still abuse. My father tended to do nothing and usually just told me to let it go to avoid conflict.

When I was 19, my stepmother kicked me out over a petty argument and I ended up moving to my friends mom’s house and I’ve been living with her family for about the last 2 ish years. I made up with them briefly but then after having yet another petty argument, I made the choice to cut contact with my stepmother completely. She was blocked for a while, but I unblocked her because I saw her irl sometime after and she said if I had her blocked I’d get no updates on my dads health.

My father was diagnosed with aggressive bladder cancer sometime before I moved away. It’s been hard on him, and scary for everyone, especially for him. 

He keeps insisting on me making up with my mother and visiting. Since I am no contact with her I have refused and offered alternatives like meeting at a coffee shop, coming but bringing a friend, or agreeing to come alone if my stepmother steps out of the house for a few hours. He says he can’t meet me anywhere because he can’t travel well with his condition, and that he doesn’t want me to bring a friend because having all the medical equipment out is too embarrassing. He hasn’t given me any particular reason to refuse having my stepmother step out other than that she’s done a lot for us (my father was in prison before meeting her and had a hard time finding a job, so we would have been homeless and such without her) and that it’s ridiculous that I can’t show enough respect to just be civil in a room with her for a few hours. 

I told him as much as I want to see him I’m not willing to sacrifice my mental and physical health by interacting with my stepmother, and I feel that I’ve offered all the alternatives I can. He says I’m giving him demands in order for him to see me, and that he just wants support from his family since he’s having a bad time dealing with his illness. He’s upset I’ve made no effort to come help make his day better when he’s been having a terrible couple of years.

I feel like I’m fair for not wanting to interact with my stepmother. At the same time I’m not sure if I should just bite the bullet and visit since I’m not sure how bad the cancer will get, and I care a lot about my father. I’m worried I’m focusing too much on my own comfort and being selfish. AITA?

2,1ehvu0z,AITA for how I treated my grandma?,"I (30F) have never had a great relationship with my grandmother (70s F). 

She has strong opinions on everything and criticises everyone around her if they don't measure up to her arbitrary standard. Over my childhood years she has criticised many things about me including my untidiness, how much of a ""bad housewife"" I would make, and made comments about my weight. 

She also never admits to criticising people as she is ""not directly insulting"" us. For example, she would make a comment about how last time she saw me I was ""so chubby"" but now I have allegedly ""lost weight and look so much skinnier"" and refuses to see that as a criticism since she's complimenting my current weight.


Onto the story - I have given birth a couple of months ago and since my grandma lives in another country she is only visiting me and my daughter for the first time now. 

As she arrived at my house she immediately started giving me unsolicited advice about the way I should raise my child, how to keep the house tidier (even thought I spent hours making sure the house is as spotless as I could make it in anticipation of her comments), and she also generally made comments about how bad the country I live in is. I let a lot of these opinions slide since over the years I've learned how to deal with them. 

At some point she casually mentions how nice it would be if she were to live nearby so she could visit more frequently. 

Here's where I may be the asshole - I replied that I  would probably move further away if she moved nearby, and after she expressed how that was a very hurtful thing to say, I simply said how it was also very hurtful thing to be criticised nonstop. This spiralled into a shouting match where she went on about how she can't believe how ungrateful of a grandchild I am, asking what she's ever done to deserve this, and telling me that I'm reading criticisms into what she's saying when she's only trying to engage in conversation. When I stood my ground, she started crying and said that she's going to go back to her hotel since she's not needed here and she even called up my father (her son) for him to listen to how she's being treated while we were still arguing. I told her to stop painting herself as the victim and I stormed off into my bedroom to try and calm down. 

For the rest of her visit (she did not go back to her hotel after all that) I did not engage in much conversation with her and tried to focus on housework and my daughter.
