0,1ei3hqu,AITA for bothering my girlfriend for praising another guy to me?,"Well, my girlfriend and I have been together for about a year and a half; We were always calm with each other, we never had such serious problems, except for one thing: her male friends who are extremely ""🧐"" and make me uncomfortable,

example: one of her friends (coincidence or not, he was into her ) I've said some shitty things about myself to her in relation to my gender (I'm transgender) So I told her I felt bad about it and she decided to block him, and in the meantime he sent her messages all the time crying like a child and I always said ""he thinks life is a strawberry, cry more you asshole"" (it was in vain because a few days later she unblocked him and today they are best friends again 🤡)

the most recent problem occurred on Monday when we were taking a walk together and she saw a friend she hadn't seen in a few months, so she went to say hello (so far so good), so I kept walking little by little while she talked to him until she came to me again, Then she came and said ""I haven't seen him in so long, wow he has such strong arms, my goodness""

So as I already gave up reacting, I decided to repeat what she said in other words (or not) on every occasion possible, because as she likes those ""strong arms😍"" I will torment her with them for a good few weeks.

1,1ehybve,AITA for refusing to visit my dad with cancer because I don’t want to see my stepmother?,"I (21, trans M) lived with my father and my stepmother basically since I was a little kid. My bio mom is mostly out of the picture due to me being removed from her care due to abuse, but I’ve been with my father and stepmother since I was fairly little so she basically raised me.

My stepmother gave me the basic needs a parent does, like housing and clothes and food, and she wasn’t always bad. But she started becoming more abusive when I hit middle school and it’s only gotten worse since. I feel like elaborating in the post itself would muddy the post and make it too long but I’m willing to elaborate in the comments or wherever. Not all of it was physical but it was still abuse. My father tended to do nothing and usually just told me to let it go to avoid conflict.

When I was 19, my stepmother kicked me out over a petty argument and I ended up moving to my friends mom’s house and I’ve been living with her family for about the last 2 ish years. I made up with them briefly but then after having yet another petty argument, I made the choice to cut contact with my stepmother completely. She was blocked for a while, but I unblocked her because I saw her irl sometime after and she said if I had her blocked I’d get no updates on my dads health.

My father was diagnosed with aggressive bladder cancer sometime before I moved away. It’s been hard on him, and scary for everyone, especially for him. 

He keeps insisting on me making up with my mother and visiting. Since I am no contact with her I have refused and offered alternatives like meeting at a coffee shop, coming but bringing a friend, or agreeing to come alone if my stepmother steps out of the house for a few hours. He says he can’t meet me anywhere because he can’t travel well with his condition, and that he doesn’t want me to bring a friend because having all the medical equipment out is too embarrassing. He hasn’t given me any particular reason to refuse having my stepmother step out other than that she’s done a lot for us (my father was in prison before meeting her and had a hard time finding a job, so we would have been homeless and such without her) and that it’s ridiculous that I can’t show enough respect to just be civil in a room with her for a few hours. 

I told him as much as I want to see him I’m not willing to sacrifice my mental and physical health by interacting with my stepmother, and I feel that I’ve offered all the alternatives I can. He says I’m giving him demands in order for him to see me, and that he just wants support from his family since he’s having a bad time dealing with his illness. He’s upset I’ve made no effort to come help make his day better when he’s been having a terrible couple of years.

I feel like I’m fair for not wanting to interact with my stepmother. At the same time I’m not sure if I should just bite the bullet and visit since I’m not sure how bad the cancer will get, and I care a lot about my father. I’m worried I’m focusing too much on my own comfort and being selfish. AITA?

2,1ehvu0z,AITA for how I treated my grandma?,"I (30F) have never had a great relationship with my grandmother (70s F). 

She has strong opinions on everything and criticises everyone around her if they don't measure up to her arbitrary standard. Over my childhood years she has criticised many things about me including my untidiness, how much of a ""bad housewife"" I would make, and made comments about my weight. 

She also never admits to criticising people as she is ""not directly insulting"" us. For example, she would make a comment about how last time she saw me I was ""so chubby"" but now I have allegedly ""lost weight and look so much skinnier"" and refuses to see that as a criticism since she's complimenting my current weight.


Onto the story - I have given birth a couple of months ago and since my grandma lives in another country she is only visiting me and my daughter for the first time now. 

As she arrived at my house she immediately started giving me unsolicited advice about the way I should raise my child, how to keep the house tidier (even thought I spent hours making sure the house is as spotless as I could make it in anticipation of her comments), and she also generally made comments about how bad the country I live in is. I let a lot of these opinions slide since over the years I've learned how to deal with them. 

At some point she casually mentions how nice it would be if she were to live nearby so she could visit more frequently. 

Here's where I may be the asshole - I replied that I  would probably move further away if she moved nearby, and after she expressed how that was a very hurtful thing to say, I simply said how it was also very hurtful thing to be criticised nonstop. This spiralled into a shouting match where she went on about how she can't believe how ungrateful of a grandchild I am, asking what she's ever done to deserve this, and telling me that I'm reading criticisms into what she's saying when she's only trying to engage in conversation. When I stood my ground, she started crying and said that she's going to go back to her hotel since she's not needed here and she even called up my father (her son) for him to listen to how she's being treated while we were still arguing. I told her to stop painting herself as the victim and I stormed off into my bedroom to try and calm down. 

For the rest of her visit (she did not go back to her hotel after all that) I did not engage in much conversation with her and tried to focus on housework and my daughter.

Tom, Ken and I are friends inside and outside of work. Jake,Tom and I are in the same department. Jake and Tom are both managers and I am a lower level employee in their department. Ken is in a department that works closely with us on certain projects.  Ken and Tom don't like Jake. They think he's incompetent, a liar, withholds information etc. At times they have collected evidence of their grievances and submitted them to Jake’s manager and spoke to the head of Jake's department about it. Jake is my direct manager, I'm not his biggest fan but I am not trying to cause any workplace issues and try to keep my opinions to myself. 

The incident: A couple months ago, Tom let Ken know that Jake thinks we (Ken and I) are plotting against him since we are close friends. Ken told me this while we were hanging out after work one day. Obviously Ken and I are not plotting against Jake. Apart from complaining once in a while while hanging out, I don’t say anything about any issues I have with Jake. Ken told me not to tell anyone about what Jake had said about us supposedly plotting against him. 

At work the next day, Tom came into my office to complain about whatever Jake had done wrong that day. After a few minutes, he decided to leave my office in case Jake noticed he was in there talking to me. I said something to the effect of “yeah..we wouldn't want him to think we're plotting against him”. Tom (who was the one who told Ken about Jake's concern)  laughed and left my office. 

Soon after that, during a meeting between Tom, Jake, Ken and other coworkers, Tom made a comment about people “plotting” against people that made Ken have to cover for the fact that he knew about Jake’s concerns. I don't know what was said or how it made Ken look bad since I wasn't there. 

The next time Ken and I hung out, he chastised me saying I put him in a bad position by talking to Tom about Jake's concerns and that I made him have to cover his ass when Tom brought it up in front of Jake.

Now, I may have messed up by making the comment to Tom the day before. I honestly didn't think anything of it at the time since Tom was the one that told Ken originally anyway.  The way I see it, I didn't put Ken in a bad position, Tom did. I didn't bring up the comments during a meeting, Tom did. I didn't discuss Jake's comments with anyone that didn't already know. Tom might have brought it up during the meeting even if I hadn't mentioned it the day before! Tom should have known better than to bring it up in front of Jake unless he was purposefully trying to start something. Honestly, Tom is the type to say rude things in meetings because he knows people won't stick up for themselves in that setting. 

I apologized to Ken for putting him in a bad spot and I have already distanced myself from Tom but it's been bugging me ever since. Was I the A Hole?

I was not happy with this comment as it sounded like my sister didn't deserve to be treated with basic respect but also didn't want to embarrass Jenny.

Jennifer then went on talk about how that would've never happen to her as men see her as ""high value"". I don't know what about this comment that just pissed me off but I said that she was giving ME ""the ick"" and to stop talking to my sister like that.

The argument we had when we got home was massive, and Jenny told me that I was over-reacting to an innocuous comment and would make a terrible father because I would always favor my sister over everyone else.

I was not happy with this comment as it sounded like my sister didn't deserve to be treated with basic respect but also didn't want to embarrass Jenny.

Jennifer then went on talk about how that would've never happen to her as men see her as ""high value"". I don't know what about this comment that just pissed me off but I said that she was giving ME ""the ick"" and to stop talking to my sister like that.

The argument we had when we got home was massive, and Jenny told me that I was over-reacting to an innocuous comment and would make a terrible father because I would always favor my sister over everyone else. I'm shocked at called a 'terrible father' and honestly still don't think I was wrong, but need another opinion.",0.0,1.0383814573287964,1,0
7,1eiony7,AITA for meeting with my friends when my sister is in town?,"I am finishing up my graduate program and as such I am currently spending most of my days writing and finishing up experiments, which has not been super fun. Last week, my sister recently asked if she could come to my city this weekend. I was honest with her, letting her know that this time is really busy and I don’t think I will have much time to host or meet up, but if she does come of course I would still meet her even if for only a brief time. She understood and said she would not be coming. Before this, a group of friends from my city asked to meet up. I have been able to meet up over these past few weeks, but I suggested a meetup for this weekend.

On Tuesday, my sister texts me and tells me that she is coming to my city this weekend. She asks me what I think and I reiterate what I told her previously. I also mentioned that I had made plans with some friends and she is very welcome to join. She says no problem - she okay with doing things on her own and she can meet whenever I was free. I let her know that I think Saturday evening will work best for me and arranged for my meeting with my friends to take place on Sunday. I told her I couldn’t meet her on Friday.

 

Today (Friday) she arrives, settles in (she is not staying at my place) and tells me she will drop by my place. I'm not sure what to say, so I say okay (I know is completely on me - I should have said no). I tell her to bring some work to do for herself so I can work. She shows up and starts talking and asks why I arranged to meet with my friends and that I should cancel these plans instead if I was so busy. I was annoyed so I basically told her I had a free full weekend to work before she decided to come. She got angry and we stopped speaking.

I'm not sure if I am the AH (I know there are many moments where I might be). I feel guilty because I had arranged a meeting with my friends and it feels like I am putting friends above family. I feel guilty for not seeing my sister and only arranging to see her on Saturday. For me, when someone who is just a distant friend comes to town, I might just meet for a coffee or small meetup, but my sister is someone who I am close with, so ideally I want to spend as much time with her as possible. This weekend just wasn't good for me although maybe it is hypocritical that I arranged a meetup with some friends (although this was planned to be two hours max)? I also do want to spend time with my friends before I finish school and I feel guilty for never having time to meet. I also feel like my sister crossed some boundaries and only came this weekend because it was most convenient for her.

8,1eiokuz,WIBTA for telling a friend she is too much,"Hi everyone, I need some advice. A few years ago I met Alice ( fake name). We weren't that close, she was friends with another girl but she quickly , kinda forced herself into my life. By calling me a lot every day, texting... to make a long story short she kinda forced the friendship. It has been 3 years now, and to be fair I am kinda overwhelmed by her. She is way too much for me, she calls me everyday every hour when I don't reply to her asap or call her back asap she will be like "" oh you don't love me blablabla"", she trauma dumps on me everyday tells me nobody cares abt her and that she is all alone, when I spend hours and hours listening to her. I am a person who needs a lot of time off, and I isolate myself a lot , she takes way too much of my energy and idk what to do anymore.
 I told her multiple times that I need space and that I can't call her all the time but it's like talking to a wall. I really do appreciate her a lot but it's a lot for me. I can't deal w her traumas and issues, I can't listen to the same boy problems anymore. It's always the same thing, I keep on giving her advice and listening to her but atp it's just overwhelming for me, I also have my own issues like, it's really a lot . 

Whenever I bring this topic up, she brushes it away and laughs saying stuff like "" but you got a social friend that needs a lot of attention so you have to be social w me"" girly pop no, I do not have to do this. 

So yeah pls give me some tips to say this to her , again, and all anyways thank y'all.

9,1eiobfm,AITA for telling my friend “I hope she was the right choice”?,"I (27F) had planned to meet up with my cousin (27M) and our friend (25M) for a fun night at a bar/arcade. Throughout the week my friend and I invited just a few other people. But by Thursday one of the girls we work (24F) with was asking for the details of the arcade/bar night. I didn’t really say much thinking, “my friend invited her, he can let her know where it is.” I wasn’t very fond of her and had no notice of her going. The day comes, I was running a little late, but when I got there my friend, my cousin, and this girl were all there. They had one drink already so I just jumped right in and had a drink. We waited for the other three friend of our join before we started playing games. After a bit of talking we got up and walked around but my cousin, my friend and this girl were no where to be found. I didn’t mind it much because I just thought they were in the restroom or getting more drinks. Almost an hour goes by, 0 replies to my text. I text them again and they just let me know they are outside smoking. After some of them not coming back in we go out to see what’s taking them so long and what’s more interesting out there since they never came back in. They were just talking and smoking nothing special. They eventually come back in with us, but they didn’t really hang out with us, they went and did their own thing. After some time and failed attempts to get food, we ended up in a parking lot talking, except my cousin, my friend and this girl we’re not there. It was pretty late into the night, Sunday night, so nothing was open. After sometime, someone called one of the 3 and asked where they were. Eventually, the 3 Found their Way to the group. By this point, I was pretty upset due to the fact that no one had any plans on where to go, but we’re expecting me to figure it out, pretty much be the parent of the group. I was pretty annoyed because my friend and my cousin had both ditched me after saying throughout the day, that they were both very excited to spend time together since we hadn’t seen each other in a while due to work. I got in my car. I didn’t say bye to anyone. About an hour after I got home my friend and my cousin text me in the group chat we have asking if something was wrong. I let them know. Yes, I thought it was very fucked up that they ditched me for this, pick me girl after saying how excited they were to hang out all of us together. I also said, “ I hope she was the right choice for you.” Were my final words. my friend later texted me asking if we could talk things out or something because he did not intend for things to go this way. I am too exhausted of feeling like the second option to people. I know this girl is young and dumb, I don’t hate her or wish her anything bad, she came off as the annoying sibling that an older sibling was forced to bring. Am I the asshole?

10,1eio8rq,AITA for setting a boundary with my roommate?,"I (31f) live with a friend (26f) in a house I own, and she pays me rent monthly. We have been friends for 7 plus years, and she moved in with me about 18 months ago. 

Things have been going really well between me and my roommate until she met her current bf. We have always gotten along and seen eye to eye with most things. 

About 4 months ago she met her bf on a dating app, and things were going well between them, and they became official about 2 months ago. I have met him and had a few pleasant but short conversations with him. He seems like a nice guy with a good respectful job, and from what I see and hear from her, he treats her well, and is good for her. I am happy for her, and hope he is 'the one' as they seem really good together and compliment each other well.

He started staying the night when they went on dates since they first met. I didn't have a problem with this, as she would always be in the house when he was. About 2 weeks into their official relationship, when my roommate left for work in the morning, she would leave him in her bedroom asleep. She says he sleeps a lot and would usually wake up about 11am, and would leave anywhere between 12 and 1pm. I would leave for work 8:30am at the latest. This would leave him in the house alone from 8:30am to 1pm.

I know very little of him first hand, so I felt uncomfortable with him being alone in the house. I can't pinpoint exactly why I feel like this, but it feels like a stranger in my safe space with ability to do as he pleases. I haven't been given any reasons to not trust him, other than I don't know anything about him other than his name, job and he likes certain movies.

I don't like confrontation, but felt uncomfortable enough to decide to bring it up with my roommate. She said he's just sleeping, which made me feel a little better. I said it'll make me feel better about him staying in the house alone if I got to know him better, and suggested regular movie/dinner dates with the 3 of us, which she noted was a good idea.

Recently, it happened again but this time she gave me a heads up that he was staying after she had left for work. Later, when we had time to ourselves, I brought it up again. She was clearly upset that I felt that way, and felt that I don't trust her enough on her judgement about him to make a good call on the situation. I tried to explain that I didn't know him well enough and it's not about my trust towards her. I tried to set a boundary which pushes me out of my comfort, but compromises on what she wants, by saying he can stay until about 10am, so he avoids rush hour. 
Eventually, she said that she respects the boundary, but now she feels that she's a guest in my house, that her bf can't stay over, and she should think about the future and save to move out. 

It was never my intention, and I  don't want to make her feel like that. I also don't want to make her bf feel unwelcome. I felt like I told my friend and roommate how I felt about a situation, and it was pushed aside for her bf.

My grandpa considered putting her in a nursing home, but didn’t, because he kept telling me she didn’t want to go. 

It was getting to the point where my grandpa would take his stress out on her, including correcting her and trying to get her to calm down. He often said behind her back, that he wishes he never would’ve gotten remarried to her, when they did. 

He would also take his stress out on me. I’m a BCBA, so whenever I used calming strategies with her, he would tell me it was my fault, I caused her attitude, he’d call me stupid, fat, say he was done with me, that he doesn’t care about me, or what I have to say, etc. He also said if she leaves, to just let her go. 

I called him out more than a few times, saying that she needed to go into a home, because he was so stressed, he was taking it out on me. My dad unfortunately took my grandpas side, and said I was disrespectful, and out of my lane, and that it was just as much as my fault, as it was my grandpas.

14,1eio4sx,AITA for yelling at my MIL?,"So some backstory to this moment: I 40F) let my daughter (autistic, 10F) borrow my phone for a YouTube piano tutorial and I stepped out of the room. Her dad was running errands and during that time he clipped a car (minimal damage and no one was hurt). He tried to call me for the insurance card and our daughter hung up on him twice before I got my phone away from her.

He was justifiably angry because he thought initially that I was ignoring his calls. There was some yelling and frantic stuff but yeeees where it gets worse.


I was venting to MIL that I was frustrated that I had been yelled at when I was trying to fix the problem and all she has to say is that I ""need to get over being yelled at"" and she proceeded to lecture me on being too emotional and kept reiterating that I needed to calm down and get over it.

So I felt the lecture wasn't helping me calm down and I said I was going to go to my room to calm down and she grabs my arm to stop me.
Nothing rough but it sent me into a fit and I screamed at her not to touch me. I told her I don't like being grabbed when I'm upset.

She stormed off for a bit and refuses to believe I feel ashamed or am sorry for my fit. Hubs is annoyed that I didn't keep my emotions in check (he did apologize for being mad at me about the phone)

My dad never raises his voice with me but my mom is quick to argue and so am I due to our strong personalities. I know it’s normal for teens to have disagreements with their parents but ever since my brother has come along my mom has been doing things that are starting to piss me off.

I love my brother so much and I don’t blame him at all. But my parents promised me that they’d make sure I’d still have my own space once he was born.

That promise has since then meant nothing. My mom will often go into my room with my brother and let him play with my stuff without asking first.

She will barge in and he will immediately grab the first thing he sees and not want to let go. So she demands for me to let him have it for a little while.

At first I was completely fine with this, yes, it’s annoying but whatever he’s a baby. That is until she has started not putting things back or letting him hold really fragile and expensive things even after I try to say no and give him something else. Then she’ll proceed to yell at me and call me selfish if I refuse to let both of them stay even if it’s at a really inconvenient time or the item in question is too precious to me.

The last straw happened a few months ago when my mom and my brother let themselves into my room while I was unaware and at school. She looked away for a second and he grabbed a glass painting I had spent 10 hours on that was on my bed waiting to be hung up. He dropped it and the whole thing shattered.

After that happened I’ve been more assertive in telling my mom when I don’t him in my room or touching my belongings and she’s yelling at me more and more because of this/ using excuses or gaslighting me into saying this doesn’t happen often. She broke my trust with the painting.. And as I write this, she took my tripod an hour ago for my brother and has not returned it even though they’ve moved on from using it.

She is 5 ft 4 in tall and weighs 110 pounds, most of which is muscle. She also exercises frequently and lately has been talking about cutting out excess carbs and sugar and eating healthier.

Riley plays 3 sports and enjoys going for runs around our neighborhood and lifting weights when she doesn't have practice. I would say she gets 1.5 hours of vigorous exercise 6 days a week, with one rest and recovery day. About a week ago, she left her planner (which she loves and uses for everything) open on the dinner table, and I saw that she had created an exercise regimen for herself, including things like push ups, wall sits, and weightlifting sets. I flipped through her planner and saw that she started her exercise routine about a month ago, around the time she started talking about reducing the carbs and sugar she eats. I've also noticed that she frequently skips breakfast, or will just have a piece of fruit and a glass of milk. When I asked her about it, she says she's not very hungry in the mornings, and assures me that she eats a good lunch (she gets it for free at school).

I am concerned about her because one of her friends struggled with an eating disorder and had the same symptoms of not eating, exercising frequently, and being more easily irritated and tired.

I (F32) have a friend (F30) and she has always been a very ""present"" person. We would spend the day exchanging messages and visit each other frequently. However, things started to get too intense this year. I would wake up to selfies, pictures of her breakfast, her cats, she wanted to have random video calls with me for hours to chat in the middle of the day, and I couldn’t go a day without sending a message. It got to the point where one day I was so tired that around 4 PM I stopped responding to messages, and by 8 PM she was calling me incessantly and even messaged my boyfriend asking about me, if something had happened. I really like my friends, but I have moments when I like to be alone, focus on work and this constant presence started to bother me a lot.

So I had my birthday last month, gathered some friends for a barbecue, and several things bothered me:

- I said I didn’t want cake, decorations, or “Happy Birthday” because I’m not a big fan of birthdays, and she made a cake, locked me out of the venue to decorate saying ""I'm going to make a decoration, and you're going to like it,"" and it took me over an hour to access my guests who were there waiting for me. She used personal photos I sent her in previous occasions for the decoration, including a picture of me crying during an anxiety attack.;

- My friends made a joke saying they would bring a ""soundtruck"" to my party (where a decorated car drives to a specified location to deliver a personalized message through loudspeakers). I said the joke made me anxious and asked them to stop. She coordinated with all my friends to prank me, pretending that the car had arrived, to the point where I locked myself in the bathroom of the venue;

- The next day, I heard from another friend that she had been the life of the party and the center of attention (it was my birthday, and that hurt me).

When the birthday ended, we had created a group chat to organize it, and the group continued to exist because we planned another gathering at my house. She wasn’t even going to be present, but she started insisting that the event be at her house, on the other side of the city, spending the whole day in the group talking to my friends to the point where I started to feel uncomfortable because everything always seemed to need to revolve around her. I said I wouldn’t attend the gathering anymore, ended up leaving the group and ignored her messages since then.

19,1einbqu,AITA for wanting my foreign boyfriend to be more proactive at using my language when living in my country?,"Hello Reddit,

I live together with my boyfriend in my hometown. I work full time, he's currently unemployed.

Since my boyfriend is from a different country, he doesn't speak my language fluently. He has been here for 2 years and he's been studying it on Duolingo the entire time, while refusing to take any paid course in order not to impact our budget for what he feels isn't necessary (I have insisted).

He's making progress and can now make basic conversation if we go out with friends. On the other hand, on top of some housework, I handle our utilities, finances, any interactions with health professionals, bureaucracy and in general anything that requires more attention than small talk about the weather.

Recently, I've started feeling like... I appreciate Duolingo and the small talks, but I resent the way he immediately pushes anything else to me without seeing it as (controlled, I'd still help) practice.

I've expressed that I'd appreciate it if sometimes he could try to find ways to deal with things without waiting for me to do them. He says that there's no point because his language skills aren't as good as mine and I'll just be faster, but I think...

A) that when I have to deal by myself with things for two people, even an extra 5 minute call ends up being a lot

B) if both ways are equally available, I'd love for him to at least try sending an e-mail if he doesn't feel confident calling. It'd save time even just if he used DeepL and I re-read it. He says e-mails are too slow

 C) that I just wish my to-do list was smaller! He says it makes sense for me to do things because I have a better memory. I try to write things down, but I can still happen to forget something. There's just so much. I don't want to have the entire responsibility just because I make an attempt while he makes writing a post-it sound like a doomed effort.

Yesterday he forgot to do something at the post office and, tonight after work, he asked me to call them instead of trying to use the Customer Support chat or writing them an e-mail himself. Maybe they really wouldn't have replied before a day... but he waited the same amount of time!

I told him that I'm burdened by being in charge of everything that involves going out of his comfort zone. I'm afraid that if we have kids I'll just be in charge of 3 people whenever we have to deal with adulting or remember that we have to do anything at all.

I want him to be more proactive. I've lived abroad with little language before and nobody was there to help me, so I had to get out of my comfort zone A LOT, but maybe it's automatically my responsibility to do these things now since I am, in fact, here and I can help.

He says that this will all get better once he learns more of the language, but I've gotten afraid that the problem lies with his attitude. When I said this, he insisted that I'm overreacting.

20,1ein2bk,AITA for uninviting my uncle to my wedding?,"I got engaged a few years ago and announced to my family that I was going to have a wedding back home  (I live abroad. I was a 32 male marrying a 28 male.

One day, on a WhatsApp family group, my godmother (56 female) asked who everyone was voting for mayor. My uncle (48 male) said he was going to vote for the far-toght candidate. This politician was a known homophobe who made plenty of declarations on TV against LGBTQ+ people, including in an interview with Elliot Page where he said that the number of gays and drug addicts increased over the years because women are not staying at home and are working outside the house instead. 

My godmother thought he was joking but he confirmed that he was voting for him because my uncle was working for the police force and one of this guy's campaign promises was to increase funding and power for the police. 

I then told him in the group chat that he was no longer invited to my wedding, because I wouldn't have someone who votes for an anti-gay politician, who is obviously against same-sex marriage, to celebrate my same-sex marriage. I left the group and he told me in a private message that he wasn't going to change his vote to ""buy a ticket to his nephew's wedding"".

Closer to the date, my godmother tried to convince me to invite him by saying that he was feeling very left out because he was the only one who wasn't invited and he was looking terribly sad when he saw my sister handing an invitation to someone else in front of him.

AITA for uninviting him publicly and going ahead with the wedding without him?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-02,"AITA for uninviting my uncle to my wedding? I got engaged a few years ago and announced to my family that I was going to have a wedding back home  (I live abroad. I was a 32 male marrying a 28 male.

One day, on a WhatsApp family group, my godmother (56 female) asked who everyone was voting for mayor. My uncle (48 male) said he was going to vote for the far-toght candidate. This politician was a known homophobe who made plenty of declarations on TV against LGBTQ+ people, including in an interview with Elliot Page where he said that the number of gays and drug addicts increased over the years because women are not staying at home and are working outside the house instead. 

My godmother thought he was joking but he confirmed that he was voting for him because my uncle was working for the police force and one of this guy's campaign promises was to increase funding and power for the police. 

I then told him in the group chat that he was no longer invited to my wedding, because I wouldn't have someone who votes for an anti-gay politician, who is obviously against same-sex marriage, to celebrate my same-sex marriage. I left the group and he told me in a private message that he wasn't going to change his vote to ""buy a ticket to his nephew's wedding"".

Closer to the date, my godmother tried to convince me to invite him by saying that he was feeling very left out because he was the only one who wasn't invited and he was looking terribly sad when he saw my sister handing an invitation to someone else in front of him. She also said that would make my 80yo grandmother very upset because her son was not invited.

I stood my grounds and went ahead with the ceremony without inviting him. He blocked me from every social media until more recently when something else happened. I will share this update later but I don't want to influence the opinion now.

This is very unusual for us considering we don't communicate unless it has to do with our kids. We have 3 children in their early teen. I reluctantly agreed and was then bombarded with questions. 

She wanted to know why didn't I tell her I broke up with my ex girlfriend (43F)? How come everyone else was informed when it happened and she was just finding out months after that fact? Why have I been letting my ex girlfriend and her kids live with me and our children if they weren't together anymore? Does this mean she and her husband are allowed to come over and see the children now? By now she was emotional and crying. She told me I was an asshole for not telling her it happen as that means this opened up the door for her to be closer to our children. 

I sighed and told her that this didn't change anything and my dating life is none of her business. I didn't tell her the first time my girlfriend and I got together either. The only reason I had told her about my girlfriend and her 3 children was because they were moving in.  I explained to her I was going to tell her about my break up when my ex girlfriend and kids had moved out.

I'm not very religious but I can enjoy the nature and stuff. This year we had to combine with a different ward to the same rental camp because funds were low.

The first meeting I already knew I wouldn't get along with this people. They were either WAY too into god or clearly really didn't want to be here. In my level there was this group of 4 girls who would make snarky comments and sit on their phones and laugh through the safety lessons. They would always talk crap about everyone behind their backs. (they even made fun of this girl who had one arm like.. wtf??)

When we got to camp it was a bit better since they slept in the upstairs of our cabin and I slept far away so I didn't have to hear them. \~2 days into camp we were doing a service project where we took logs and rocks down a mountain trail so it was easier to use. They quickly took the easy job of putting rocks in buckets so they left me, my level leader, and the girl with one arm to carry logs.

Once we got the log down the hill we came back up and one of them was freaking out that she was gonna slip. It really wasn't even that steep she was just being stupid. So she just left it there and ran off to get more rocks. I asked if I could carry it down and they said sure.

We started forming a line down the mountain to take the rocks down easier but then she came back with a tiny rock and said, ""Can you guys hurry up? We need the buckets back."" We'd probably have been done by now if she hadn't had that giant freakout and slowed everyone down.

Sometime during the activity I twisted my ankle and I could barely walk for the rest of camp. The next day we had rock climbing/repel and I couldn't do either of them so I just sat at the rock climbing wall and drew. Half way through the activity 3 of them came back from repel and started making fun of the 4th one because she kept saying, ""You have to be nice to me, it's my birthday"".

29,1eim2oh,WIBTA If I Tell My Friend She Smells,"I’m in college and have these two friends who both recently got cats. They are both in small apartments and at first it wasn’t bad. One let’s call her V, used typical litter and is on the third floor of an apartment complex. I’m allergic to cats so the smell bugs me a little more than normal, but when she first got the cat it wasn’t a big deal. 

She told us that she cleans the poop out at the end of each day or every other day (way too little in my opinion). We’ve been over there before when the cat has pooped and we’ve told her how bad it’s smelled and she just shuts the door and refuses to take it out (can still smell it). It has gotten to the point where I DREAD going over there because I know I’m going to smell like cat. It’s so bad that even when we hangout in a different location I smell her cats and if she sits in my car for only 5 minutes my car will smell for the rest of the day, and even my boyfriend notices. 

Now my other friend, P also has a cat and takes better care of it. She uses pellets, cause I told her my friends that use pellets NEVER have any stench in their house. Which has mostly worked great, and I even kindly suggested to V that maybe she should look into getting pellets too (she didn’t). Later on, P said how she essentially found a diaper genie but for cats to put the dirty litter and it’s worked great. I also veryyyy kindly suggested to V that maybe she should try this to which she said, no I think what I do is fine. It’s not.

And I feel awful because I recently went to go see P, and when she got in my car she wreaked of cat 😭😭 I know her cat had some issues potty training and has been peering all over the house but you GUYS I can’t handle the cat pee stench from my friends anymore!!!!!!

I don’t even know how to go about this but I think something needs to be done. So would I be the asshole if I told them that they/their homes stink of cat (obviously in a nice way).

Edit: my boyfriend has told me there is no way to go about this and I sort of have to stick it out. Because he thinks it would be the rude/wrong move to inform them 

Edit: I mistakenly said “changed the litter” when in reality she is simply scooping out the poop every 1-2 days. ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-02,"WIBTA If I Tell My Friend She Smells I’m in college and have these two friends who both recently got cats. They are both in small apartments and at first it wasn’t bad. One let’s call her V, used typical litter and is on the third floor of an apartment complex. I’m allergic to cats so the smell bugs me a little more than normal, but when she first got the cat it wasn’t a big deal. 

She told us that she cleans the poop out at the end of each day or every other day (way too little in my opinion). We’ve been over there before when the cat has pooped and we’ve told her how bad it’s smelled and she just shuts the door and refuses to take it out (can still smell it). It has gotten to the point where I DREAD going over there because I know I’m going to smell like cat. It’s so bad that even when we hangout in a different location I smell her cats and if she sits in my car for only 5 minutes my car will smell for the rest of the day, and even my boyfriend notices.

32,1eila41,AITA for calling out my son’s girlfriend’s dad?,"My son was at his girlfriend’s house and her dad walked into her room while they were playing on an iPads. He said to them “I hate to be this parent but what’s in your pocket?” to my son. My son said “my keys?” Then the father said “no, that.” Pointing at his pocket. My son omitted that he had a geek bar vape, which at that point the dad started patting him down and reached into his pocket and grabbed the vape. First my son texted me saying, I messed up and my girlfriend’s dad asked what was in my pocket and I said keys, but then started patting me down to find a nicotine vape. I know I shouldn’t have it but he put his hands all over me when I wouldn’t tell him what was in my pocket.

First, I’m absolutely against my son doing that let alone taking it to someone else’s house. So I was on board and had an effective conversation after my son and then the father texted me. When he texted I apologized for his behavior and told him I would have rather he not put his hands on him. But made the point I didn’t condone my son’s behavior. I ended up calling him instead of texting and he talked to me for 30 minutes about random parenting things that didn’t pertain to me or my son, just his daughter. His daughter had been struggling in school and her friend group. My son has been working and is a 4.0 student. I was being empathetic to his situation but felt like it was lost what we needed to focus on.

The following day I wanted to circle back to communicate that I didn’t like that you reached into my son’s pocket. I think if he was lying or not being respectful he should have just had him leave. I would never put my hands on his daughter in any way. It really bothered me and my son that you put your hands on him. So after communicating that he turned into a loose cannon telling me to “shut up” he’s talking not me, saying I just don’t want accountability and some other things I’d rather not mention here as it was pure hate speech. He was at a wedding reception and clearly intoxicated and I kept pleading that I just want to remind him I’m on board but like he was protecting his daughter, I’m just setting a boundary on him holding my son accountable without physical contact. He just kept telling me to shut the f*ck up.

The reason we got on the phone was because he texted me l saying:

He was lying to my face and I knew it. He was also in bed with my underage daughter doing something that was illegal (vaping nicotine). I’m sorry, I was being a parent. You have decided to let your child vape and I have not. So, we have different parenting styles. I treat your child like mine, essentially, whether we are out to dinner or whatever, I am supporting him and my daughter. But if your main concern is me holding him accountable for his behavior when with my daughter and providing her a drug essentially that you sanction, then yes, we are on different planets. Let’s keep our kids to ourselves. If you can’t get on the same page with me, they should not be hanging out. Let’s just pretend that my daughter is the bad influence and shoved a vape into his pocket. You are ridiculous if you think I’m going to be ok with his behavior. Feel free to search my daughter for drugs. I’ll applaud you afterwards. Seriously?!

My response:

I’ve tried to reason effectively with you and that doesn’t seem possible. All I can do is apologize for anything I did, which was threaten to sue you for touching my kid. (This was after he was yelling profanities at me and my attempt to get his attention to calm down) I don’t know how else to say I am on board with you guys. I am okay with you calling him out, sending him home, and notifying me etc. The only thing I cared about was you just not laying your hands on him. Why you are saying I allow this or think any of it was okay is beyond me. I also did not say any of this was your daughter’s fault. I don’t want to be against each other or put our kids in the cross hairs. How can we effectively communicate without calling names and being unkind?

Am I missing something that I felt how he handled it was inappropriate?

36,1eik4o6,AITA for not inviting a friend to a sleepover because he already had plans?,"Okay so for context - there's me (19m), my boyfriend (20m), Blake (18m) and Max (17m).

Me and my boyfriend wanted to invite our two friends over at the weekend for a sleepover, as we've hardly seen each other the past few months due to Blake doing exams.

We originally decided on Sunday to Monday, as Blake had another sleepover with other friends on Saturday night. So, wanting to make a longer weekend out of it, we invited Max over on Saturday and Blake would join us on Sunday morning.

This is where the problem started. Me and my boyfriend said on the group chat that Max would be coming over and staying Saturday night, and the following convo ensued:  
Blake: what :(  
Me: we got jelly  
Blake: so ur leaving me out???????  
Me: ur not available, and ur coming on sunday

This then turned into Blake saying that we are leaving him out ""just because i have plans with other friends"" and that this feels unfair, and that we are purposefully excluding him. Me and my boyfriend disagreed with this, saying that we would have had both Blake and Max over for two nights if possible but Blake had other plans so physically couldn't.

He then claimed that he knew it wasn't personal, but felt that its ""objectively unfair to leave one person out"" and that ""the plan was made in retaliation""

From that, i stated that i wanted to just drop the subjects and move on from it, cancelling the plans to have Max round and we would just move forward with all 4 of us instead. But i still don't agree with what Blake said, especially as me, my boyfriend, and Max have all hung out while Blake was busy in the past - and he didn't mind at all.

So.. am i the asshole for even suggesting the saturday plan at all? or was Blake overreacting?

TLDR:: me and 3 others were going to have a sleepover, and one was invited for two nights - and the other got jealous because he wasn't invited due to him already having plans.",0.0,1.022668957710266,1,0
37,1eik0n2,AITA for wanting my roommate to contribute to rent after study abroad?," I (24F) live with two other roommates (24F) and (24M).  The other two are in a relationship and share a room.  My roommate, let’s call her Kate, was studying abroad in Italy for the last academic year on scholarship.  While she was away, me and my other roommate, Tony, were splitting rent and bills according to what we agreed on.

Kate got back in late April from her program.  Tony and I had agreed that we would give Kate some time to readjust and settle back down after her program.  We had a conversation in late May establishing the ground rules for the house since Kate is back.  

One thing established was that Kate would begin paying rent at the beginning of August and would be officially added to the lease that month as well.  (Tony had been paying 1100 and I was paying 1300// the new split would be Kate 700, Tony 700, and Me 1000).  Everyone agreed that was a reasonable timeframe for Kate to find a job and start making enough money to pay their portion of the rent/bills.  

Now it is August and I was only told a few days before rent was due that Kate doesn’t have a job and can’t pay rent in a message from Tony.  Which is frustrating too because I expected to hear something from Kate telling me that she didn’t have the money.  I haven’t heard anything either from Kate about the situation or expressing any apologies about missing the deadline.  

Since June Kate had applied to some jobs but has expressed that she wants a job that is fair paying and won’t treat her poorly.  Which I completely understand because I have worked several restaurant/corporation part time jobs where I was treated like a puppet.  But, it got to a point in July where I would come home and Kate would be watching stuff on her phone for hours in the living room.  I don’t expect her to apply for jobs with every living moment and I understand she could have been applying to places while I was at work. 

I am frustrated that Kate doesn’t have a job even though she has been living rent free for 3 months after graduation.  Tony has been supporting Kate’s groceries and personal care items since she’s gotten back.

38,1eijtek,AITA For not splitting ownership of my dad's house I inherited with my brother?,"My dad passed away last year and I ended up inheriting 100 percent of his house because around 35 years ago, I was added as a co-owner to his house when he refinanced it and since he died without a will, I ended up inheriting 100% of the house. 

When I told my brother that the property tax was reassessed at market value for the house, he told me that I should just split it with him since the property tax would remain the same. I refused to split it with him because his wife had made comments about selling the house and if I split ownership with him, there would be no guarantee that his share would go to my daughter, who was my dad's only grandchild since my brother doesn't have any kids.

40,1eije37,AITA for making my uncle bawl like a baby? ,"My aunt(42F), who raised me and is very close to my family (my dad’s sister), married my uncle “Barry” six years ago. She was under a lot of pressure to get married back then (she was 36 and my family feared that she wouldn't be able to find someone if she waited too long). Barry, who works in AI, has a high post in AI development. Unfortunately, whatever higher being gave him intelligence must have fallen asleep for his street smarts - how he survived this far is astounding to me.For example, he once booked an 8-person vacation group on THREE separate flights and EIGHT individual hotel rooms in TOLEDO, Ohio, instead of Toronto. My aunt, who is very street-smart but impatient, seems to tolerate his quirks but I feel she must be tired of them. In conversation, she has alluded to the fact that she gets annoyed with his family who treat her like a servant rather than a daughter.

I am visiting my aunt's house this summer. For one of his biweekly brainfarts, he decided to weed the lawn without gloves and  got some dirt under his nails . He washed his hands ""thoroughly"" according to him but nothing came out. He started complaining loudly about how much it hurts and how he can't continue with his work. We took him to an UrgentCare where they said nothing was wrong with him. Once we got home, he started whining and complaining again and how ""he knew it was blood but the doctor must have been wrong"". At this point, I was fed up with his whining and told him ""The doctors are licensed and did a thorough diagnosis. You are an AI engineer not a doctor. Why don't you leave the medical stuff to them."" Apparently, my logic was too much for him and he started yelling, ""You are just a little, spoiled kid. What do you know about pain !"" I thought I was severely unlucky and had to deal with his second brainfart of the week immediately after the first and told him ""I am just telling you to calm down as there is most likely nothing wrong with you, according to the experts."" I'll be honest, at that point I was tired of his whining and I added on, ""The only thing wrong with you is that brain."" I know I should respect my elders and all that but I was sick of him. Until he said, ""It must be in your family’s blood to be this stupid, if you think I am dumb."" Stupidity was the only thing running through his veins yet he had the audacity to say that my family were the idiots? I lost my temper and yelled at him, ""The only stupid one is you. If you can't tell the difference between Toronto and Toledo, the social norms of booking rooms, of booking flights, then I can never attribute intelligence to that brain, no matter your career.""

41,1eij4qh,AITAH for not giving my stepsister part of my dad’s inheritance? ,"Throw away for privacy. My 20F dad passed away recently and my family is expecting me to share my inheritance with my stepsister. My mom and dad divorced when I was 12. He discovered my mom cheating on him with my stepdad. My mom and stepdad got married and he brought my stepsister, Stella (17 F) into the marriage. We don’t have a good relationship, I’ve always viewed them both as the home wreckers that ruined my family and upheaved my life. 

My dad made good money and put a lot away for me since I don’t have any siblings. He was diagnosed with cancer 5 years ago and started putting money away into specific accounts for major events in my life, college, wedding, first home. When he passed everything went to me, every single thing he owned. When the dust finally settled with his funeral arrangements I was left with his house, vehicles, and some stocks/bonds. Along with the money from his 401k, Roth IRA, life insurance policy, and his savings accounts. And his cat. 

About a week ago my stepsister, I’ll call her Stella approchaed me asking me if I’d use some of the money I inherited to pay for her college. Because our parents fall under the “make too much money for financial aid according to the government but not enough to actually pay for her college” umbrella she will have to take out loans. I told her no and when she argued I told her that when her dad died she could do whatever she wanted with the money she got from him but until then she’d be finding her own way to pay for college. 

Our parents approached me later asking me to reconsider because “I didn’t need all this money” and that my dad would want me to be generous with it. I told them to F off, that he wouldn’t want his ex wife’s affair partners kid to benefit anything from his death, and that if he wanted me to do anything specific with it he had five years to either tell me or write it down somewhere. They said that if I wasn’t going to be a good sister I could go live somewhere else, so I did just that. 

I loaded the stuff that I had been keeping at my mom’s house and took everything back to my dad’s house. I’ve gotten texts from all three of them as well as my moms relatives and some people in my stepdads family saying that I’m selfish and inconsiderate and that I should just do one kind thing for my stepsister.

About a week ago Cece wanted to dye her hair letting both parents know if she could go to the store with Matt or I, she could buy box dye with her birthday money. Cece has type 4a hair in the darkest shade of brown, when she asked me to take her to get box dye I knew that not only would it not stain her hair, letting a 12 year old girl do her own hair has a good chance of severe damage. Being the person I am I took her to my stylist, a personal family friend who works on all hair types. I played 170 us dollars for the service plus a tip of 35 dollars for fitting Cece in. I go home with my sister as I compliment her hair (she got pink and green referencing Mitsuri from demon slayer) After we get home Cece shows our parents, telling them about her amazing experience and around an hour after Cece is sent upstairs for bed I'm called down and yelled at for taking my sister to dye her hair. They say it looks like a train wreck and they won't be paying to ""fix"" it. I told them there's nothing to fix because her hair was done to perfection. After about an hour of fighting they said I would be grounded and that I was cut off from the family friend until I find a way to fix Cece's hair. I don't see the issue because they gave her permission to go and get box dye that wouldn't work and I spent my personal, hard work earned money. So AITA?

I go home with my sister as I compliment her hair (she got pink and green referencing Mitsuri from demon slayer) After we get home Cece shows our parents, telling them about her amazing experience and around an hour after Cece is sent upstairs for bed I'm called down and yelled at for taking my sister to dye her hair. They say it looks like a train wreck and they won't be paying to ""fix"" it. I told them there's nothing to fix because her hair was done to perfection. After about an hour of fighting they said I would be grounded and that I was cut off from the family friend until I find a way to fix Cece's hair. I don't see the issue because they gave her permission to go and get box dye that wouldn't work and I spent my personal, hard work earned money. So AITA?

Edit: For the people saying stuff about the vibrants, the pink and green in her hair are very muted compared to the box colors she picked. Second off I got my hair dyed (purple and blue) at the exact same age she did without complaint from my parents(they paid for the service)",1.0,0.0392546765506267,0,0

I’m on probation right now and got permission to leave the country for a few weeks. My dad gave us each 400 usd each. I only spent two hundred dollars as I am 250$ in debt to my older sister and 540$ to my mom. Just out of high school and searching for a new job, used to work with my dad but it got very complicated. The first day we arrive in Europe we all exchange a good amount of money, apparently at the time I had an equivalent of 20 usd of my brothers exchanged currency. We’re at an ATM and my brother asks for the 20$ so I give it to him, thinking I had the money to spare at the time. flash forward  two weeks and I’m down to only 10 usd, and my little brother tells me that I owe him the 20 usd that I exchanged with my older brother weeks ago. I told him I didn’t have it and to talk to our older brother about the money, but he’s attacking me saying I gave it to him and that I should give him what I owe. (My older brother and younger brother got in a fight and that’s why he won’t ask him) I tell him I’m not gonna pay him ts and he says that he’s gonna take collateral 😭 he’s ready to crash out over 20 usd, it’s really crazy. I believe him too, not even a week ago he threatened to hurt me if I didn’t stop talking. Which I didn’t because who is he to tell me what to do? He proceeds to throw a full cup of wine at my face, followed by his phone. So our relationship has been rocky since than, now he’s threatening to take something of mine if I don’t pay him the money my older brother should pay. I believe he’s gonna take something so ima try my best to hide my shit and take something of his first. I took 60$ out of the 240$ he had left.

While there one of my good friends let me borrow his acoustic guitar.

And he responds ""I didn't let you borrow so you could leave it with (roommates name) and moving forward when you displace or damage something thats lended to you in good faith its up to you to replace it""

So he said he'll pass on the trip and see me at the wedding in the fall. Am i the asshole here? Like I tried previously to return the guitar to my dude and everytime the response was I'll get once i get it.

I stayed home with our first for 3 years. Then we moved, I got a full time job. I got pregnant again a few years later, I worked until the day before I gave birth. I had an emergency c-section(that's a story by itself). My maternity leave was short lived. I was only given 2 weeks paid leave then the other 5 weeks were unpaid. During my leave, we had new carpet installed in our house. He told me that if I didn't get on all fours to make sure all of our daughter's barbie stuff(a good portion of which are mine from my childhood) if was getting thrown out with the old carpet, he put no effort into helping me. I was 2 weeks post c-section, still had stitches, and crawled around to preserve mine and my child's toys. 
When I returned to work he was supposed to get paternity leave, he got the time, but never the money. He also told me, that he wouldn't be doing any of the household chores. So I became the sole income for our family, and the house keeper, 7 weeks post-partum. He never got another job. 

Fast forward 2 years, I get pregnant again. He was expecting me to only take 2 weeks maternity because this time, I was also, only given 2 weeks paid leave. When I told him I wanted to take 7, same as last time, he freaked out and told me we couldn't afford for me to take that much time off. But he couldn't get a job to help? (Ideally I would have take 12 weeks like a standard leave but being the only income in our house it wasn't feasible). 


He has been the SAHP for 3 years. 

The chores he manages to accomplish only benefit him. His laundry. Sometimes the kids laundry. 

The things that don't get done unless I do them, are as follows: 
Taking the dogs out
Feeding the kids breakfast
Feeding the kids dinner(I walk in the door from work and start cooking immediately, I barely get to say hello to my kids)
Going to the grocery store
Making the bed
Putting the children's clothes away
Vacuuming

Cleaning of any kind
Washing windows
Mopping/sweeping
Toilet cleaning
Taking the kids outside
Arts and crafts

50,1eih8xc,WIBTA if I confronted my best friend 4 days postpartum? ,"

I’ll try to sum this up despite it being a buildup of almost 10 years of emotion. For more context, I have a vent post on my page, which is my only other post.

My (20F) best friend (20F) started ignoring me for months out of the blue. Genuinely nothing happened. The last time we spoke or saw each other was the solar eclipse and we had a great time. I’m trying very hard to accept it and move on, especially since, over the past 9 years, she’s always grated on my mental health and shown through her actions that she didn’t care much for me. While it was never anything too extreme, almost 10 years of that feeling chipping away at you can make you fed up. It’s reached the point where I can’t tell if I’m being overly emotional or if these are valid feelings.

My friend gave birth this past Monday, and I heard nothing from her. I found out through my sister, who was already invited to the hospital. I didn’t expect to be the top priority or the first call, considering that having a baby is a huge deal and, as a 20 year old, there’s not much I can do to help. But it did sting, given past situations. After hearing almost nothing from her since the beginning of August, she texted me this Wednesday, saying I could meet her baby if I wanted to. No mention of her sudden disappearance for months.

She said she didn’t want a lot of visitors at the hospital because her blood pressure was high which I 100% understand. But I just find it strange that out of everyone I was the only one told this and I was the last one invited. 

(To those who might say she was probably busy or stressed from being pregnant, while that’s true, she was still interacting with and going out with other people.)

I’m at the end of my rope. I’ve accepted that this friendship isn’t doing me any favors mentally, and I’m trying to move on. But now I feel like I have three choices, and only one seems like the right thing to do: flat out ignore the text and try to move on; put my feelings on the back burner and act like nothing happened; or try to have a discussion with her and explain that her behavior over the years and now have made me feel like shit.

She said I was “high maintenance” and “shallow” because I liked putting effort into my appearance. She would say that I didn’t deserve to date someone like her brother and that he was too good for me.

Every time I attempt to be nice to her and patch things up between us, she said I was fake. She said I only wear makeup and stylish clothes to distract from my ugly face. She always says that she doesn’t understand what her brother sees in me, and that she couldn’t wait for him to break my heart and date a woman who is actually on his level.

My boyfriend has never defended me before, saying that his sister is just opinionated and “quirky”. He has also prioritised her before me on multiple occasions. He postponed our plans to move in together because his old apartment is closer to his sister and she’ll miss him too much. He even missed out on a ceremony where I received an award because his sister had a mental breakdown.

My SIL has called me countless of names in the past, including “bitch”, “cunt”, and “hoe”. So for the past few months I’ve been calling her a rather snarky nickname whenever I’m talking about her to my friends.

55,1eigksj,AITA for pulling out of a verbal deal at the last minute? ,"Ken wanted to sell his laptop to get a new one, so he asked me. I actually didn't need one but he used to ask often over calls.

One day my younger sister told me she wished she had a laptop. So in one of the calls with Ken I hesitantly agreed to buy for my sis, told him I don't need it though. He was kinda convincing me how the laptop I have is old and I should buy his laptop.

Now, the day before we were supposed to meet and do the deal, I mentioned the plan to my parents. They got mad at me as they didn't want my sister to have access to a new laptop(she's somewhat addicted to parent's phone already). They also mentioned that the price is also higher than for usual used laptops.

Then I had a verbal fight with parents trying to convince them, that how backing out would look bad on me, etc. Then I told Ken the news. He was mad at me, as he had cleaned the laptop and got it serviced. I had around 3 verbal fights.

Aftermath 1: 

I tried to remedy the situation by trying to call used laptop sellers to ask for price, called Ken to see how he's doing, apologized to him a lot, spend hours trying to find prices on sites to sell. The prices was way lower than what he wanted to sell for. He was still pissed at me. He compared me with other people who were helping him find a buyer, how good people they are as they did X at Y time Z years ago. I told he could cancel the order for the new laptop, and keep this one, but he denied. I called him many times.

Next day, he calls me, he said some pretty hurtful things to me out of nowhere, he mocked my chronic injury that has made be very depressed since a long time, as it is not getting better. He made fun of my personality, how I'm sometimes don't trust people easily(i'm just being cautious, my country has high crime rate), how I'm a confused, unreliable guy.

Aftermath 2:

We don't talk much since then, and I feel very hurt inside, I don't feel like telling anyone about my struggles anymore. This was the only guy i occasionally talked to, as I'm very busy/stressed with full-time job + off hours study grind. I'm a self taught junior dev.

So at dinner, when my daughter came to the kitchen asking ""What's for dinner"" I pointed her to the fridge. 

My daughter went straight to her dad (my husband) to complain about it, and he said ""You didn't help, and you know what that means."" I thought he was on board with the rule, until later that night he said ""Ok so you're not actually serious with this rule right?"" and I told him I am.

I got out of the military last year after my birthday so this is my first one home. My birthday was this past weekend, and my parents originally forgot about my birthday and scheduled a vacation that they couldn't/didn't want to cancel. My sibling 27m and his spouse 27f, live a few towns away. They only communicate when they need/ want something. I have attempted for almost a year to hangout, or meet up to spend time with my sibling. He either always cancels or makes an excuse as to why they won't attend. The favorite excuse involves their toddler and they use it frequently. I am aware that having children makes it difficult to do things that you previously did before they were in the picture, but I'm more than willing to usually accommodate them and they would be welcomed at any hangout/meet up. My spouse (26f) and I have gone out of our way for them to watch their child, as well as meet up with them for their convenience. For example, we drove over 45 minutes to meet up for my siblings spouses birthday.

Onto the current situation. My parents wanted to make it up to me for missing my birthday. They told me I could pick wherever I wanted to eat, so I chose one of my favorite restaurants that's in a town 30 minutes away from us at 6 pm. My sibling and his spouse informed me that they will not attend, saying that it's too inconvenient and would disrupt the night time routine of their child or eating at a later time would mean they might have a tantrum. They said they would attend if it were someplace in my town. For reference, my town is approximately 30 minutes away from their house, and the restaurant is approximately 45 minutes from their house.

I said that while I understand their reasoning that I'm disappointed that they wouldn't try to find an alternative solution other than just not attending, but they are adults and can do as they see fit.

For those of you who will ask why I didn't change the location to a place in my town, the locations for sit-down dining are limited and we either eat at them frequently or, due to dietary limitations that are new for me, I cannot eat there. Plus, regardless of distance, or whether we liked the restaurant, we accommodated them for their birthdays. 

My parents feel that I should just change the location so they can attend, but after no one wanted to spend time with me, my sibling and his spouse were home the weekend of my birthday, or be home for my actual birthday, I don't want to sacrifice my happiness to eat somewhere that I don't want to or somewhere that will make me sick.

Despite this, most people let it slide because she's a pain to argue with. I accepted it as part of who she is, and never brought it up.

A few years ago, she went through a rough breakup, was a student, broke, and her car died. I had just received a car from my grandmother, an older model but in perfect condition. I could have sold it for $8-9k. Instead, I offered it to her for $4k to help her through a bad time. All it needed was new tires.

Now, a few years later, she's moving and selling the car. I told her I'd like to buy it back and she was happy about that. I assumed we'd work something out based on the deal I gave her, after discussing it, she hesitantly agreed to sell it back to me for $4k. The car had about 30-50k more km, wasn't well-maintained, and was used off-road (its not an offroad vehicle.) The car had like 1 minor issue she fixed.

After this, she texted me saying she consulted w others and said she would sell it for $6,500. Her message was long, claiming it's her car and we had no buyback agreement. No apology or acknowledgement for the situation. Basically just a long justification about how she thinks shes in the right. Also i'm 98% sure that the response was from chat GPT - I was upset & felt used, and told her I wouldn't pay that price, that I felt taken advantage of and that her behaviour was shameful. I just dropped it after that.

We were adopted by my biological mom’s half brother and his wife, who really wanted little kids and took me in because cps didn’t want to split us up and would’ve given us to another family member further away that was willing to take all of us if they didn’t agree to take me. 

I have anxiety, depression, autism, adhd, cptsd, and at the time I had 2 eating disorders. They were not prepared to handle any of that so I was put in hospitals and other treatment programs for the majority of the first year, then the 2nd year I got kicked out of 2 boarding schools. After the 2nd school my adoptive mom begged her sister to move in and take care of me because they couldn’t handle me. 

I came home and found out I was going to be living in the finished basement with my aunt and I was pissed. I tried really hard to make it hell for her and get her to leave. She stayed and put everything she had into getting me everything I needed and making sure I’d be able to function as an adult. We moved out when I was 18 and for a while I didn’t hear from my adoptive mom. Our relationship has gotten better over the years but I don’t call her mom and have never seen her as a mom. I’ve been calling my aunt mom since I was around 16. 

I’m also engaged to the greatest guy and have an amazing relationship with his mom, who I also call mom. We took in my best friend’s 2 kids (2 yr m and 8 mo f) and the day we told her she went out and bought car seats, high chairs, and cribs. They had a room in her house and a play area set up by the end of the week. She even drives a half hour each way twice a week to make us dinner so I don’t have to cook. 

The 2 year old had a birthday last week and we invited my adoptive mom and her family.

She ended up skipping the party over this and I’m worried that this will hurt our relationship. Aita for not calling her mom while her family was here?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-02,"AITA for not agreeing to call my adoptive mom ‘mom’ in front of her family for a day? My siblings and I (25f) were adopted when we were 12, 2, 1, and 6 weeks old. We were adopted by my biological mom’s half brother and his wife, who really wanted little kids and took me in because cps didn’t want to split us up and would’ve given us to another family member further away that was willing to take all of us if they didn’t agree to take me. 

I have anxiety, depression, autism, adhd, cptsd, and at the time I had 2 eating disorders. They were not prepared to handle any of that so I was put in hospitals and other treatment programs for the majority of the first year, then the 2nd year I got kicked out of 2 boarding schools. After the 2nd school my adoptive mom begged her sister to move in and take care of me because they couldn’t handle me. 

I came home and found out I was going to be living in the finished basement with my aunt and I was pissed. I tried really hard to make it hell for her and get her to leave. She stayed and put everything she had into getting me everything I needed and making sure I’d be able to function as an adult. We moved out when I was 18 and for a while I didn’t hear from my adoptive mom. Our relationship has gotten better over the years but I don’t call her mom and have never seen her as a mom. I’ve been calling my aunt mom since I was around 16. 

I’m also engaged to the greatest guy and have an amazing relationship with his mom, who I also call mom. We took in my best friend’s 2 kids (2 yr m and 8 mo f) and the day we told her she went out and bought car seats, high chairs, and cribs. They had a room in her house and a play area set up by the end of the week. She even drives a half hour each way twice a week to make us dinner so I don’t have to cook.

62,1eifqrp,AITA for talking to my friend’s crush?,"I, (15F), was introduced to my best friend's (15F), friendgroup- the one the hangs out with almost as frequently as she hangs out with me. That friendgroup consisted of three people, a girl (H), and two guys (J and W). I was introduced to them in an outing where we visited a very famous event at Universal studios, and we had a great time, and all of us became friends after. 
Her crush (W) in question had severe appendicitis which could risk his appendix literally rupturing and hence he couldn't come to the event with us, but he did join us for dinner. I was in H's telegram channel and she posted a nuance that I highly agreed with. Naturally, my reaction was to comment under that post in her channel with the intention to discuss that topic further. As we were talking, W joins the chat section and the three of us start talking. H was joking around and talking about how she poked his butthole and I joked that he probably liked it, while he was actively denying it and all three of us had a good laugh. The conversation shifted to a separate topic, and the three of us were conversing until it was about 2:30am where I get a notification from my best friend's channel. Keep in mind this channel is private, and only I, and 3 other people are inside, so this space was typically used to share more private information or rant. Suddenly, I open the channel and I am greeted with many message posts. The following message posts are in order: 
""God i hate when this happens"" 
""What fucking ever"" 
""Ok wtv i shouldnt be pissed"" 
""Maybe i'm just having mood swings"" 
""Is this because i skipped the audio"" 
""| can't even get mad because i have no place to"" 
""Wtv""
""I'm still fucking pissed"" 
""Literally know your limits bro"" 
""This is so fucking annoying"" 
""How many times has this happened already"" 
""GO FUCKING DIE""

""IM FUCKINF SHAKING”
""[NWORD]""x3
""HOPE YOU FUCKING ROT"" 
""KNOW YOUR LIMITS [NWORD]"" 
""Ooh this one's got a lil kick"" 
""Never been this angry in a while""
And a while after that line of messages, she texts our friendgroup chat (We have a separate friendgroup that is school based and very tight knit. It is just the two of us and two more girls.) , ""I think l'm not gonna go for W anymore."" in response to my friend asking her in the groupchat if she was okay. She then said ""I'm already blessed enough to have him as a friend."" It was only 3 hours later that i checked the timestamp of the chat I had with H and W and the timestamp of her large stream of messages did I then realise she was talking about me. She has told me before that she liked him, but I never knew talking to him was crossing the line for her. Had I known this, I would have avoided speaking to him altogether.
I tried to speak to her but she hasn't replied my messages, although she's seen them. I am not interested in this guy, and I just want some possible answers for why she’s acting like this. AlTA for having a conversation with her crush?

Because, to take me away from my childhood home seemed EXTREMELY unfair to me. 

Moving to the point of this post, When I was 10, I was attending an annual new years party on my mother's side of the family, near the start of the party, I decided I really wanted a soda, since I don't get them that often at home, and here I wasn't that supervised and most people seemed to forget I am pre-diabetic. 

Once I got back from the cooler with the drinks, I sat down in my chair, trying my best to not lose my absolute shit because the place was practically covered in mosquitoes and I despise mosquitoes to an extreme level.

My ten year old self hid out in my mother's car for the rest of the gathering, waiting for my father to come for me (but the thing is he was in a whole other city visiting my grandma) so yes, I stayed in that car with my phone, sobbing. For hours.

Safe to say seven years later, me and my mother's relationship is strained, I dislike my mother's side of my family and refuse to go to the new year gatherings now. And I have come to the terms, that I am infact selfish and I'm fine with that.

65,1eidxre,AITA for not transferring all my money to a joint savings account?,"Hi reddit,

I (32F) just got back from a vacation abroad with my long-time partner (36M) and it's caused some trust and financial issues. During the trip, he lost his phone, lost our passports, and got detained by police for trying to sneak one joint into a music festival. Thankfully, we got his phone and passports back, but when he got detained, they cut off his festival wristband and kicked him out. It was literally day 1 at 3PM and we had looked forward to this festival for over 15 years. It's incredibly hard to get passes to this festival.

Well he ended up buying a $5K weekend festival pass on resale so that he wouldn't ruin our weekend and we ended up still having a great time. But always at the back of my mind, I couldn't help to think about how this man added so much stress to what was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime. During the festival, he brought up how we should combine our savings accounts so that we could earn more interest and come up with a plan to pay off the trip and wristband he got on resale. I was a bit hesitant because of everything I just mentioned, but understood that we could make more money from our high yield account if we combined.

  
Well today he added me to his account, that has substantially more money than what I can contribute, and asked me to make a transfer. I transferred 4/5ths of my savings and kept the rest in my original savings. He sort of had an idea of how much I had total and then asked me why I didn't transfer the rest. I told him that my mom gave me that money for emergencies and that I still wanted to have my own savings account for personal financial goals. Well he did not like that at all and told me that I had trust issues.

  
I didn't deny it, I told him I was already hesitant to transfer a single cent after what we had just experienced on our trip, but that ultimately I knew that if we combined we could earn a bit extra so I did what he wanted anyways. I told him that he could keep a separate savings account too, that I didn't mind, but that I wanted to have something only I could access. I told him that as a woman, I'd like to have my own little nest egg and that I found it weird he was giving me gripe for keeping a small amount of money to myself. Now here is where I may be the AH: I called him manipulative and that maybe he was scared that if I had my own separate money it would be easier for me to walk away. He really blew up on me saying that he was taking all the risk and that he's doing just fine without my money to make his own life, which is true. He's the main breadwinner and pays for pretty much everything, though I paid for most of the trip myself. Then he told me combining our savings was a terrible idea and to take my money back and we can try again when we fully trust each other.

68,1eidml8,AITA for not taking down a perfectly fine photo for someone who is vain?,"I’m a 45F and I have a sister who is 43F. Recently, we had a large wedding in our family that became a family reunion. Lots of photos were taken with the promise we would share them on our private family whatsapp group. 

Some of the photos I took were casual shots at a brunch. There were twenty girls in that photo including me and my sister. To tell you about my sister, she has always been EXTREMELY vain. She’s very coiffed all the time but even worse is that she’s a social media addict. She posts obsessively every single day to prove she is fashionable, popular or show off her designer lifestyle. Her pictures are always so heavily filtered, she looks positively cartoonish. 

At the brunch, some of us were casual, some dressed better. She was perfectly made up and looked great. I posted the photos on our private family group along with a few other cousins with identical photos from their cameras. None of us posts on social media at all other than her, so we know they won’t be shared. The photos were very sweet and everyone liked the photos except…my vain and insecure sister.

She went ballistic on me! She called me up to scream and demand I take them down as she didn’t approve. How dare I share unfiltered photos of her, she gets to have final say of her image, etc. I told her absolutely not because others had requested them and second, how was she planning on getting the other identical photos removed? Was she going to yell at the other cousins? We all saw her in person that day, we know what she looks like. 

A few hours later, she decides to get revenge by posting unflattering photos of me on the group. I ignore it. She then sends me a text threatening to post photos of my college age daughter, who had privately battled an eating disorder a little while back (but has since recovered). The photos were of her at her lowest weight. That did it for me. I told her off and dared her to go through with it and see what the consequences are.


She kept threatening to do so for a day until my mother called me begging me to take the photos off as my sister was about to go through with it and do more damaging things. My mother agreed there was nothing wrong with the photos I put up but she couldn’t handle the threats as they were giving her palpitations. I told her if I took them down, we were enabling the bullying as my parents always did when we were growing up and it would only embolden my sister further. But my mother begged me and I took them down for her, knowing we had just accomodated an emotional terrorizer.

This is not the first time she has done something like this. She loves to create a scene to get her way. Between this and her vanity, I think she is a disordered individual.  It was accomodated a lot as children and still is to this day. I’m embarrassed to be in this situation as middle aged women but…

I posted the photos on our private family group along with a few other cousins with identical photos from their cameras. None of us posts on social media at all other than her, so we know they won’t be shared. The photos were very sweet and everyone liked the photos except…my vain and insecure sister.

She went ballistic on me! She called me up to scream and demand I take them down as she didn’t approve. How dare I share unfiltered photos of her, she gets to have final say of her image, etc. I told her absolutely not because others had requested them and second, how was she planning on getting the other identical photos removed? Was she going to yell at the other cousins? We all saw her in person that day, we know what she looks like. 

A few hours later, she decides to get revenge by posting unflattering photos of me on the group. I ignore it. She then sends me a text threatening to post photos of my college age daughter, who had privately battled an eating disorder a little while back (but has since recovered). The photos were of her at her lowest weight. That did it for me. I told her off and dared her to go through with it and see what the consequences are.


She kept threatening to do so for a day until my mother called me begging me to take the photos off as my sister was about to go through with it and do more damaging things. My mother agreed there was nothing wrong with the photos I put up but she couldn’t handle the threats as they were giving her palpitations. I told her if I took them down, we were enabling the bullying as my parents always did when we were growing up and it would only embolden my sister further. But my mother begged me and I took them down for her, knowing we had just accomodated an emotional terrorizer.

This is not the first time she has done something like this. She loves to create a scene to get her way. Between this and her vanity, I think she is a disordered individual.  It was accomodated a lot as children and still is to this day. I’m embarrassed to be in this situation as middle aged women but…

69,1eidlln,AITA for repeatedly telling my brother that he is an extremely lucky individual and has an easly life because of his looks?,"Firstly, my brother (27M) is a really attractive man, much more than me (17M). He's short, but certainly way above average by most peoples standards. I wont lie, seeing the way people idolise him and treat him like a king is really infuriating and completely impossible to understand. He is such a boring, uninteresting and generally primitive shallow individual. He views himself as this sort of advanced human being who is capable of thinking at a very deep level, but hearing his opinions, he's anything but.

Despite this, he can get a women with ease due to his good looks, and people are overall very attentive to him and place him on a throne. The worst thing is that he takes all of this as if it wasn't for granted and gives himself this sort of undeserved credit as if he's worked to be where he is (he hasn't at all, he's an extremely lucky person who never had any hardships in life and was always subject to very good treatment from others, something that I believe may be connected to some sort of halo effect.)

He is a spoiled individual who cannot understand the view point of other people. He tells me that I'm disrespectful for assuming that the reason he managed to date so many women so early is because of his looks, telling me, quote, ""you have no idea how hard I worked to be where I am and to get a girlfriend."" I then told him that, considering he's an 8/10 male with a boring personality, he did not work to get a women because when he was 15 years old, women would basically chase him. He didn't approach them, he didn't take care of himself and he dressed terribly with the worst styling choices imaginable. They came to him like they've never come to me. Yet he plays it off as if he works for it.

Of course, this made him angry and he went on this narcissistic rage/rant where he called me disrespsectful, probably because he cannot ever admit that he's good looking as he cannot stand the idea or the mere concept that perhaps he was given a jumpstart in life that most people were deprived of and he didn't actually work to get anything.

How much of a narcissist would one have to be to deny one of the biggest advantages given to them and write it off as their hard work? How can he spit in my face like this and tell me that looks are irrelevant (they're not, every piece of statistical evidence point towards just how important looking good is). Furthermore, why does he believe that looks don't matter when he himself has never lived in the shoes of an unattractive person? He has a massive aura of dunning kruger and tunnel vision focused solely on his own selfish self praising grandeur world view to understand that not everything is a direct result of his own actions.

98% of the women that he has been in a relationship with wouldn't have even thought of of being with me.

So my daughter built a gaming pc when she was 15 partially with her own money.

After she went to university she bought a laptop and rarely uses her PC she went pretty far away for University so she only visits occasionally.

My son is really into gaming he usually plays on his iphone or my old laptop he uses and he isn't able to play high end games.

Recently my old laptop broke and my son asked if he could play on his sisters computer as she rarely uses it. As my daughter isn't here much I figured she wouldn't really notice or even care.

So my son played on her computer almost every day. When my daughter came back home for the summer she noticed that a few extra games had been installed on her laptop she didn't notice it for a while but she eventually did and asked if my son had been playing. She got upset and told me she shouldn't have let her brother play without even asking her and that she would be fine with him playing if I had atleast asked her. I told her I didn't think it was a big deal because she almost never touched the computer anymore. She was upset with me for a bit but forgot about it but when I was speaking to my friend about it she told me I'm a huge ah and need to Apologise.

They used to live with their grandmother and only moved in with us 3 yrs ago after their pregnancies (they both got pregnant, at the same time..) At first, they were really nice to me and my mom, but things have recently changed. I’ll use code named so things don’t get confusing. 
I got along with Sally, one of the sisters more than I got along with Sofia, the other sister. Sally and I would trust each other with our personal life details, and we even smoked grass together occasionally. Which by the way, I regret. Me being naive, I assumed this would stay between us, and all of our other conversations. 

The other day, my stepbrother was in my room and I was on the phone with my bf. My boyfriend and I got into an argument on the phone, and unfortunately this led to me raising my voice and some cussing. My stepbrother and I have always been close and we grew up together, so i have always trusted him. He left my room after seeing I was upset. Clearly i shouldn’t have raised my voice in front of him, and I apologized to him afterwards. Since Sally’s room is next to mine, she overheard and assumed I was yelling at my stepbrother. She told my stepdad, and my stepdad confronted me, I explained everything and even my little brother explained it too. My mom didn’t know of this, and she found messages on my stepdads phone between him and Sally explaining the situation. My mom asked me and I explained, and she was also upset. She confronted Sofia, and Sally got mad and turned my stepbrother against me. He will not talk to me, and he won’t hang out with me anymore, which honestly hurts me deeply. 

As for Sally, she has began a hate campaign against me. She told her dad about the grass, and she also said I brought my boyfriend over (which i never have.)

Instead of offering her a monthly allowance I said mom if you don’t want to work anymore I can take care of you. I will sleep in the living room and you can sleep in my master bedroom. I won’t charge her rent and she won’t have to worry about food.

I have two siblings 27F and 22M. 22m still lives with her and pays half the rent. My mom got let go of her job a while back and has been doing odd jobs since. I have been trying to get her to apply for easy going jobs but she REFUSES! My friend got hired through the agency I was going to take my mom and talked about how easy the job was but still she refused to go. My mom is completely able bodied. I feel like she is young. My coworker is way older than her and she’s still working. Recently whenever she comes over she will brag about how my sister 27f has been giving her $300 a month for her rent and throwing indirect comments at me. Instead of offering her a monthly allowance I said mom if you don’t want to work anymore I can take care of you. I will sleep in the living room and you can sleep in my master bedroom. I won’t charge her rent and she won’t have to worry about food. (I cant afford to give her a monthly allowance because I pay my houses rent alone I don’t rent a room like my siblings because I have a kid now). She got offended and said I had no mercy for her. I just don’t know how to handle this situation. She says that she took care of us for 18 years so she deserves for us to take care of her from now on. The thing is she is 50 and completely healthy. So we can be taking care of her 30+ years if God grants us life. Ay no just pray for us 😭. I’ve just been feeling so guilty since she said I had no mercy. Am I wrong for not picking up an extra job or something to be able to help out? I mean that is a possibility. ,0.0,0.05012122169137,0,1
77,1eiay42,"AITA For ""Alienating"" My Daughter Against Her Mom?","Throwaway Account 

I (36m) have a daughter ""Jane"" (12f) with my ex ""Mary"" (37f) and one of the reasons we divorced was because our stances on family and personal boundaries were just too different. Mary was one of six and grew up believing that ""family always shares"" to the extreme. After we got married there were times where Mary would let her brothers borrow my stuff without asking and if it wasn't returned in the exact condition that it was given she'd just shrug it off and say ""we're family so it's okay."" I hated it.

I did grow up with siblings and we did share but my parents instilled the importance of asking before taking, treating the items gently, respecting a person's decision to say ""No,"" and understanding that there were just certain things that you don't touch. My family wasn't rich but we were more financially stable than Mary's side and that was always her go to argument whenever I would bring up how upset I was along with our differences in culture. 

The final straw for me was when Mary allowed her sister to take my car while I was out of town. Her sister wasn't listed as a driver of the vehicle so when she got into an accident with it my insurance wouldn't pay up (unless I filed charges) after the accident was ruled as her fault. Mary's sister refused to help pay the costs and Mary didn't want to touch her own savings either and got an attitude when I needed to use her car, and I was just done.

We have 50/50 custody and unfortunately this ""family shares everything"" mentality is being passed down to the next generation and Jane's cousins almost always take her things. Her cousins can get pretty reckless with her stuff because they know none of the adults will raise much of a fuss and she ""has a rich daddy"" who can just buy her a new one. Jane hates it and hates going over to her mom's place or events with her mom's side of the family because in addition to having to share her mom is now offering her up as a free babysitter for the younger cousins. 

Jane has never really talked to me about this because her mom made her feel as if this was something that she HAD to do no matter which parent she was with, but one day when she was getting ready to go back to her mom's she broke down and told me everything and I told her that when she's 13 she can decide to stay with me longer if she wants to and that seemed to make her feel better. 

My plan was to talk to Mary about this privately but when Jane and Mary got into an argument Jane let it slip what I said and now I'm being accused of brainwashing Jane and my ex is threatening to take me to court over it.

Ok so, my parents have been planning to go on this trip for awhile. It’s to celebrate one of their family member’s birthdays. They wanted me to come. Well basically, even though I am staying at my parent’s house, I still have a job, kinda. It’s my senior thesis project for university that I’m required to get a head start on during the summer. I am also working with multiple people on this, so working around their schedules is important. It’s very hard work but I’m proud of my progress. But they basically refuse to recognize that I have a work schedule and that this is important work. They basically just assume that because it’s on the computer that it’s not real work or something. Therefore they get mad at me when I can’t go out and do things with them when they want to because they think I can just hop off the computer anytime they want me to ig. I’ve been very clear about what my work schedule is but they refuse to listen. I told them I’d love to spend time with them, but they would have to do it during my breaks or when I’m not working, which they get mad about.

Well anyway. This trip starts approaching. It’s a four day long trip during a crucial period where I need to work with my partners on the project because the deadline is approaching. (In a month but there’s so much to do so yeah basically missing those days of work would be very bad for me). Anyway, so I planned to work some during the trip, and they said that would be ok for me to do. Well basically what happened is, my mom broke the laptop I was going to bring to work on the trip. I told them without this laptop I cannot go on the trip because I need to work. And then they just said “well fine, we don’t want you to come anyway, I’d rather you stay here” because they were mad that I was stressed ig and they mentioned they don’t like it when I’m around them. Pretty hurtful but I got the point. I prepared to stay home while they went on the trip. Well in the morning, I was in my pajamas working on my stuff and they came in my room like “what’re you doing”. And I said “working?” And they’re like “we are going”. And I said “ok have fun” because I thought we agreed I’m staying home. But they started getting mad they’re like “you have to go what the heck”. I was confused because I thought it was agreed I wasn’t going because my laptop is broken. 

I said “I have to stay here since my laptop is broken.” They started yelling at me because of this and I was confused. I said “I thought you preferred me to stay here” and they denied that they said that? And then they just did an exaggerated head shake and sigh saying “I don’t understand”. I thought I made myself pretty clear. Anyway they left me home alone in a huff. They’re definitely angry with me and enraged. I feel really bad.

83,1ei9lbw,AITA for backing out of doing my sister’s hair the day before I was supposed to?,"
Me (20F) and my sister (22F) have always had issues. She wants me to braid her hair for her tomorrow. She asked me about a week or two ago to do her hair, and we have had many arguements between then and now. Today was my final straw, and I am thinking about telling her no altogether. Please let me know if I’m overreacting?

For context, one of the main issues l have with her is her household contributions. We live with our mom, meaning we have shared spaces. She NEVER cleans our shared spaces. Tasks like taking the trash out, mopping the floors, cleaning the bathroom, etc., are tasks STRICTLY done by me or my mom. Another main issue is the car situation.

When I was 16 l worked 2 jobs to be able to get my own car by 17. Over a year ago, my sister got into a wreck with my mother's car, making MY car the family car. This new arrangement was (and still is) hell for me, since my mother's work schedule is insane. She has to go to work at 5 am (3-4 times a week), meaning either me or my sister has to wake up that early to drop her off. She gets picked up at 9:30 pm, which ruins a lot of my nightly plans. Then, she has a parttime job (2-3 times a week), where she has to go midday for a couple hours. I take my mother to her part time job, since my sister works during the day.

Since it is my car, and my work schedule is flexible, i've assumed TONS of driving duties. I also have to take my sister to work and pick her up too. This is difficult for me because I constantly have to keep waking up and going back to sleep and it takes forever for me to fall back asleep.

 With all this in mind, I recently told my sister ""If I have to take you to work, you have to take our mother to work. I'm not getting up twice in the morning to drive you guys around."" I feel like this is reasonable because, 1. she is the one who totaled my mom’s car, 2. she doesn't pick my mom up after work, or take her to her other job EVER, 3. she constantly uses my car even though she didn't put a single penny towards it, 4. she does nothing around the house. Despite me telling my sister this, she tells my mom that she's not taking her to work when she doesn't feel like it. So, I have to get up twice to give them rides in the morning and evening. This happens often, but I feel like it was dumb of her to do this the day before she wants me to do her hair.

Now, knotless braids take a long time. Professionals normally take 8-12 hours to do the style, so imagine how long it takes me. I enjoy braiding, but I don't want to reward my sister for her lack of contribution. I feel like I could be the asshole for canceling the day before. Considering how long it takes, she cleared all her plans for tomorrow. The braids average $350 but I charge her $50-100. I doubt she can get an appointment for tomorrow, and she most likely can't afford it on such short notice. Please give me some advice here. Should I just do it?

84,1ei9cj9,AITA for not letting my brother use my bathroom?,"I 18F have two younger siblings “Myla” 15F and “Aiden” 14M. Since I am the oldest, I have an en suite bathroom that will become Myla’s once I leave for college (I’m going into my senior year of high school but I’m old for my grade). Recently, Myla has gotten really into makeup and spends well over an hour in the bathroom each morning. During this time, she won’t allow Aiden to use the bathroom even just to relieve himself.

Aiden asked me if it was okay if he started to use my bathroom in the morning, and I said that was fine. I thought it wouldn’t be a big deal, but Aiden didn’t always flush, regularly left splatters on my toilet seat, clogged the toilet TWICE, and never turned on the fan or sprayed air freshener. I won't get too nasty or detailed but Aiden has a really strange diet, causing frequent, FOUL bowel movements. It got to the point where I was embarrassed to have friends over because of how bad the bathroom smelled. For two weeks, I reminded Aiden every day to wipe, flush, turn on the fan, and spray air freshener, even putting signs in the bathroom for him, but he just ignored me. Eventually yesterday morning I told Aiden he had to either use the guest bathroom or the half bathroom attached to the kitchen, or figure something out with Myla.

When I got home that evening, my mom was very upset with me. She told me it was a privilege to have an en suite bathroom, and that most kids have to share with their siblings, and I should be more willing to share with Aiden. I pointed out that Myla isn’t sharing with Aiden either, and there are other bathrooms in the house that are mostly unused.

She also reminded me that I used to spend as much if not more time as Myla getting ready, but it didn’t impact anyone since I had my own bathroom. I’m wondering if Reddit thinks I’m being unreasonable or if I have a point?",Not enough info,2024-08-02,"AITA for not letting my brother use my bathroom? I 18F have two younger siblings “Myla” 15F and “Aiden” 14M. Since I am the oldest, I have an en suite bathroom that will become Myla’s once I leave for college (I’m going into my senior year of high school but I’m old for my grade). Recently, Myla has gotten really into makeup and spends well over an hour in the bathroom each morning. During this time, she won’t allow Aiden to use the bathroom even just to relieve himself.

Aiden asked me if it was okay if he started to use my bathroom in the morning, and I said that was fine. I thought it wouldn’t be a big deal, but Aiden didn’t always flush, regularly left splatters on my toilet seat, clogged the toilet TWICE, and never turned on the fan or sprayed air freshener. I won't get too nasty or detailed but Aiden has a really strange diet, causing frequent, FOUL bowel movements. It got to the point where I was embarrassed to have friends over because of how bad the bathroom smelled. For two weeks, I reminded Aiden every day to wipe, flush, turn on the fan, and spray air freshener, even putting signs in the bathroom for him, but he just ignored me. Eventually yesterday morning I told Aiden he had to either use the guest bathroom or the half bathroom attached to the kitchen, or figure something out with Myla.

When I got home that evening, my mom was very upset with me. She told me it was a privilege to have an en suite bathroom, and that most kids have to share with their siblings, and I should be more willing to share with Aiden. I pointed out that Myla isn’t sharing with Aiden either, and there are other bathrooms in the house that are mostly unused. Mom said that we would all talk as a family this weekend (my dad is currently on a business trip and gets back tomorrow), but in the meantime I should be more considerate of Aiden’s needs and let Myla experiment with makeup.

AITA for arguing with my brother rudely?

I 17 yo(F) live with my parents and my brother 21(M) it is normal for Indian sons to never move out and be with their parents and wife in a joint family.

So I'll start with what started the argument, I was hanging a cloth on a door so it can dry as the drier at my house isn't working while I was doing that my brother came and loudly said don't hang it here you hung something yesterday and their was a lot of water in the floor.

I said I have drained all the excess of water already and the floor won't get wet today but still asked me loudly you washed your bag yesterday and it got the floor wet to which I didn't reply.

Then I irritatedly said why do you care so much about the water and stomped to my room and he followed me all while shouting at me saying that I am mad or what to which I replied yes I am just like you.

Btw just so be clear he has cussed at me before a few times to which I reacted very angrily and told my mom it wouldn't take me a sec to cut him off if this behaviour is continued as I've already struggled with such behaviour with my other family members (as in my uncle and his wife) 

I told him that this is frustration from other aspects of his life( this comment was uncalled for tbh) to which he replied that if went down that route he'll tell me very discretely what frustration really is which pissed me off as this is something which triggers me.

Then I just started saying things such as are you stupid who talks like that in the between all the conversation we kind of became very rude.

A few things about how he thinks and talks disrespectfully has always pissed me off and I've always thought that his behaviour and things he say while he is angry is toxic and hurtful.

86,1ei83op,AITA for asking money for the food I bought for friend’s wedding?,"I am 28F living in DE with a well-paid job, currently supporting both, myself and my bf, who lost his job.

Recently, I was invited to a two-day Spanish-Italian wedding as the bride's witness. The two day event was held three hours away from the city and included a wedding ceremony, lunch, party and next day a barbecue to celebrate the relative's birthday. We were told not to bring any gifts as the couple has planned second wedding in Italy for 80+ people and rented out a mansion. The groom’s family is very rich.
As a witness and best friend, I always went above and beyond by helping her in every day life. For the wedding I rented a car for +250 euro, I was picking up guests and helping a lot with logistics (bringing ppl from and to the airport).

However, things took a weird turn when I arrived to the barbecue and was told that there is not enough food for us and we have to go shopping. Fine, it happens, we made a list of groceries for ourselves. While we shopped, I got calls from the hosts to buy more food. My bf was even asked to get fresh bread. At the barbecue, I was asked to help with cooking which I ended up doing for one hour. The food which we bought was distributed around all tables, meaning that we kinda sponsored the barbecue which we were invited to? The stupidest moment was that when my bf asked for bread, he wasn’t allowed to take the fresh bread he bought? Fiancé’s relative was not doing much, he was suffering from hangover from previous night. Others were hanging around and enjoying the setup. I had a nasty feeling, though I was happy that I could help. Afterwards, the couple went on a honeymoon and asked me to take care of their plants for one month, which is totally fine with me. I prepared them a nice bottle of champagne to celebrate their return from the Honeymoon.

As I spent a lot of money on food, I wanted to get some reimbursement. It’s not like I bought food for only my bf, my friend and me, but for all others who could have gone shopping as well. I added the expenses to Splitwise and assigned 2/5 to the bride.

Despite my efforts and expenses, I was harshly criticized for being a terrible friend, for not bringing a present, not washing dishes, or contributing enough financially. I was told that I should be thankful that their friends allowed us to stay overnight (we got them a bottle of expensive wine as a thank you).
Then her fiance accused me of trying to get their money and suggested I check my finances. The groom even implied that I didn't do enough for the wedding. However, I had already followed their words not to bring a gift and had been supportive in various ways. I was at work and all of this destroyed me emotionally.

my mum called me again and i told her i was feeling better and it didnt hurt as much, but obviously she was still worried so told me to tell my brother that in 25 minutes he'd need to get up and come help her with the shopping bags. my brother did go to work last night, and came home around 1am but it was now 11:30 am so he had been sleep fof a good 10 hours. he was obviously pissed and said what does my eye injury have to do with going to pick up the bags. and how he'd been at work so i should go but my mum told him he should come. he goes and says he'll only come if he can take my phone. i gladly give it to him lol, i may be addicted but i can give it up for 30 mins. he takes my phone and then looks at my screentime, it was 18hrs, he said so u can be on ur phone for 18hrs but cant go out for 30. i try to explain that i can adjust my brightness on my phone but same cant be done for the sky... and for some reason the sky affects me  more than my phone.

89,1ei7sj2,AITA for not leaving my parking spot until the person waiting gave me space to do so safely?,"My car was parallel-parked on the right side of a busy two-way street (single lane in each direction) in a major US city.  All street parking spots nearby were taken.  I was sandwiched between the cars parked behind and in front of mine.

However, upon entering my car to leave, another driver stopped their car in the actual lane of the street to my left, such that their car was parallel with the car parked IN FRONT of me.  This driver’s rear bumper was approximately lined up with the handle of the driver door of the car parked in front of me.

If I would have pulled out at this moment of time, I would be stuck behind the person trying to take my spot.  The only option I had would be to drive all the way into the lane of oncoming traffic and then drive on the wrong side of the road to get around the car waiting for my spot.  Like I said, it was a busy time of day, and my visibility wasn’t great due to my car being small, the car parked directly in front of me being a huge SUV, and the car waiting for my spot was also blocking a lot of visibility of the oncoming cars.

I waited for the car to move, but sure enough, traffic started to back up (since there is only one lane).  Some of the backed-up traffic eventually cut into the oncoming lane to get around the blockage If there was an opening.

After a minute or two, the blocking driver got out of their car and yelled at me to ask if I was leaving the parking spot.  I told them I couldn’t get out safely with their car blocking the way.

My brother is kind of a shy person , but I've always tried to maintain the relationship with him and my nieces by pushing my brother to meet each other at least once a year and by sending gifts to my nieces. We invited them for a weekend to our house several times or met at a neutral territory, but never at their place, as they never invited us. For about a year I teached my older niece French (she needed it for school) over Facetime and thought it was a nice way to maintain a relationship with her and it was. Of course, I did it for free. Neither my brother, nor his wife never said thank you for this. By the way, they never sent any gifts to my kids either, while I sent gifts to my nieces. Not really related, but still, they earn about 3-4 times more than me and my husband, so it's not like they can't afford it.
I had to stop French lessons with my niece as I was going through a lot of personal problems which led to a depression, I also had to stop sending gifts to them as money got extremely tight for me and my family.

My brother lives in another country with his wife and two daughters. I myself have a husband and two kids. My brother is kind of a shy person , but I've always tried to maintain the relationship with him and my nieces by pushing my brother to meet each other at least once a year and by sending gifts to my nieces. We invited them for a weekend to our house several times or met at a neutral territory, but never at their place, as they never invited us. For about a year I teached my older niece French (she needed it for school) over Facetime and thought it was a nice way to maintain a relationship with her and it was. Of course, I did it for free. Neither my brother, nor his wife never said thank you for this. By the way, they never sent any gifts to my kids either, while I sent gifts to my nieces. Not really related, but still, they earn about 3-4 times more than me and my husband, so it's not like they can't afford it.
I had to stop French lessons with my niece as I was going through a lot of personal problems which led to a depression, I also had to stop sending gifts to them as money got extremely tight for me and my family. I tried to justify it by telling myself that my brother never sent any gifts to my kids, so why should I? The relationship faded away.

92,1ei6chd,AITA for ruining my family trip?,"The events I'm typing happened just a few moments ago so please excuse me for any run-on sentences or punctuation/spelling errors. I'll be happy to fill in any gaps this post may leave.

I (19F) am on a family trip. Emotions have been high for a lot of us, which I chalked up to travel jitters; we only arrived yesterday and might still be adjusting. This morning, my aunt (50F) described a fight her and her husband had earlier. She attributed it to being because of the new environment. I didn't think much of it because the rest of the day was alright and quite mundane. We had lunch and there weren't many issues.

That is until we decided to get some drinks from a nearby food court at a mall. We are in a booth setting and I was helping her get the drinks for our family (all of whom were seated) and I happened to sit down before her. She asked me to move out while standing near the exit of the booth (she wanted to sit next to her husband, which is fine). I was happy to but I was just waiting for her to give me the wiggle room.

She stood there waiting and asked again in a more demanding tone. I said ""I was waiting for you to give me space"" in an admittedly snappy tone. She paused and asked me ""Who do you think you're talking to?"" and I said ""I'm just talking to you"" because I didn't know how else to respond.

She screamed at me to leave, so I did and I went back to my hotel room. Before I did, I said ""I don't think the environment's the problem, it's you.""

I feel bad about how I handled the situation and what I said but I stand by it. I left because I wasn't going to get in a screaming match in a mall. It all seems really dramatic but I feel really awful for making that scene in front of my family. I'm typing this from my hotel room. AITA?

Update: Hi all, thank you to everyone for your input. A third set of eyes can really make all the difference in realizing it is just a matter of perspective. We've both apologized to each other. She acknowledged her telling me to leave was wrong; I said sorry for my tone. (She extended it first, if that matters). To be honest, it is going to be a while before I can fully forget this ordeal but for now, I can forgive her and enjoy the rest of my vacation.

93,1ei5lft,WIBTA to ask my wife to cover up a bit?,"I and my wife (both late 20s) visited her mother (60s) for the first time since we got married earlier this year. 

Now, I understand it was hellishly hot this weekend in London but it was not unbearable. However, my wife was naked often and for very long periods of the time even in the presence of her mum. Presumably this is due to the heat. I don’t mind the occasional walk from the shower to the bedroom but this I find disturbing. 

We dated for 6 years before getting married but I never once saw this behaviour from her anywhere —including at her mum’s or sister’s places which we have visited many times before. Even at our home she does not do this. As a point, the rest of this week was even hotter and even in the privacy of our home, she was wearing pyjamas. 

What I find even more unsettling is that her mother was not bothered by this at all and acted as if all this was all perfectly normal. I didn’t see anything sexual going on here but the thought of grown children naked for no reason in front of their parents disturbs me.

WIBTA if I confront my wife more sternly and let her know that she should stop this? I grew up in India and she is British —should I be aware of something before bringing this up?

Edit: This seems have divided people in the same way I have been divided internally. But some clarification is needed. 

1. Stern is not the right word. TIL that it is about assertion of authority. The word I should have used is “direct” and honest because my intent is to be clear that I don’t find this normal and not give vague hints in the hope that she picks my meaning. 

2. Yes, I agree about bodily autonomy and yes Indians are bit more prudish but I want to clarify that nudity is not my problem here. We have both been naked in front of others in appropriate settings (saunas, gym, etc.). The problem for me here is the sudden onset, the prolonged duration, and the fact that she is naked in front of me as well as her mum at the same time.

94,1ei5jr8,AITA for calling my best friend a shallow bitch,"I (19F) recently started introducing my friends to my boyfriend (20M) of now 3 months. He’s a super sweet guy, he buys me flowers and apologizes for even yanking my hair even the slightest bit while playing with it and so many other things. Overall, my friends and family love him! All of the feedback i’ve gotten on him is that he’s sweet and seems good for me. I genuinely love him and care about him a lot.

The only person who seems to have a problem with him though is my friend (17F) who i’ve known for about 5 years now. It was my birthday recently and i deliberately made sure she was the last of my friends to meet him until the day of. She’s a very outspoken and confrontational type of person and will tell people exactly what she feels. While i’m neither of those things, my family always jokingly called her my emotional support dog. She’s been a great friend and has stood up for me countless times, and is pretty ride or die.

But lately we’ve been on rocky terms for the exact reason i wanted to wait to introduce her to him. She absolutely despises him and is not afraid to tell me so. All of her reasons mostly have to do with his appearance not fitting her taste. He has longer hair and a beard, and her favorite insult is to call him is a roach or a homeless man (even though it’s well kept) 
She doesn’t say it to his face surprisingly- but i think that’s because i’ve begged her enough to not do that. 

She continued to insult him to my face everytime i saw her after that, and it wasn’t just a one off comment everytime i brought him up- it was constant. She would go on tangents in the middle of a normal conversation about something completely unrelated. She started trying to guilt trip me into leaving my apartment with her everytime he was there (after showing up unannounced). Saying things like “You hate me”, “You never wanna spend time with me anymore” and things like that. 

It all boiled down to me finally exploding on her last night after she sent me a series of texts about “why i should break up with him”. I was so upset, and so fed up with her being so mean to him for no real reason that i sent her a very long paragraph. I yelled at her for being a bitch, i called her shallow and immature  and even criticized her own love life which is filled with shitty boyfriends that i’ve supported her through. At the time it felt good to get it off my chest- especially with how weird and rude she’s been acting- but now i just feel guilty. All she said in return was “fake asf” which doesn’t feel too good. I hate fighting with my friends and i feel i went a bit too far, but i’m also not gonna leave him just because she doesn’t find him attractive.

UPDATE: Today me and her met up after i messaged her and told her i wanted to talk. We sat down over lunch and I apologized for being rude and calling her a shallow bitch. I also told her that I was also not going to put up with her behavior towards both me and my boyfriend anymore. After talking to a few older and wiser people and reading lots of insightful comments, i have realized she is not the friend i thought she was and i have realized that some of her behaviors and actions over the years have been a bit… manipulative? (the word sounds a bit too harsh). I have broke contact with her for NOW. I told her i am willing to make amends and continue being her friend, but i cannot be in her life until she grows up a bit and learns what she did was not right either. She didn’t say much during our meet, nor did she express much in her face either- so i’m not sure how she was feeling or where she will go from here.

95,1ei5b4r,AITA for not going to see my dad because his wife is there? ,"I (19F) have a father who married his wife a couple years ago. Me and his wife have never had a good relationship. If anything, she has done the absolute most to avoid me whenever possible. When I was younger, she would find every excuse to not be around me and my sister by saying she had work or she had to go visit a friend or some other excuse. 

Recently, my dad’s wife has gotten into an argument with my mother, my sister and I over a Facebook message my sister sent her asking to talk to our dad because she’s struggling and needs him to help her. She never read the message but when my dad called a couple hours later, she had a lot of colorful words for my mom. 

During this call, she threatened to call the police, get a restraining order and get my mom arrested because she assumed my mom was the one that sent the message trying to get my dad back but that wasn’t the case at all. Once she found out it was my sister who sent the messages, her threats did not ease up or get less intense, she threatened to get all 3 of us arrested and get restraining orders.

The thing is, my sister did not say anything mean or insulting to her in her message. All she said is if she could get our dad to answer the phone so she can talk to him about some problems. That is the only thing she said to her.

She did not stop there, she talked bad about my mom, saying all these lies about what happened during my parents’s relationship. We had no idea where any of this anger came from because my mom had not said anything mean to her and did not do anything that my dad’s wife was suggesting.

The screaming from my dad’s wife continued until my dad told her to go into the other room and they would talk about it, there’s when my dad dropped that she doesn’t want us to contact her anymore and that he would call us later. He hung up before we could contest anything about it. 

After the phone call, I had made it up in my mind to not go and see my dad while she is in the same house or even close to me. If she holds that much anger towards my mom, what can I expect she will say or do to me if I was around her? 

I know my dad loves her and I don’t want to make him have an ultimatum but at this point it is either his wife’s constant temper tantrums over him talking to his kids or his children (and if we ever have kids, his grandchildren) being in his life.

96,1ei4nqa,AITA for snapping at my mother for telling me to eat healthy?,"Posting this on a throwaway.

For context, my mother is the most loving person I've ever seen. She's the type to say, ""It's alright, you can do better next time"" if I do something wrong, and I am actually careful of saying things I want around her because she will get me that thing within a week. My mother was born and raised in Korea, while I grew up in Canada. We never really had major cultural differences, but one thing in Asia is parents are usually more involved in commenting about what their children eat or how they dress. Everyone does it, my grandmother, aunt, etc, and my mother is actually way more laid back than others I've seen.

That being said, she's always worried about my health. I went through a period of intense stress when I was younger, losing weight (I was 157 cm/5'2 and 39 kg/86 lbs at the time. It wasn't an eating disorder; I wasn't living at home, so I would just not eat when I was stressed). After leaving that environment, I gained the weight back (5 kg/11 lbs).

However, my mother would still criticize my diet frequently. The thing is, I think I've eat cleaner than most now. I drink water exclusively for years after she talked about how sugary juice was. I reduced my snacking to once every week after she recommended I stop eating junk food. I don't drink. I admit that after the fiftieth time of her telling me to be healthier, it got on my nerves a bit.

Then, here's where I might've become the asshole. I was cooking broth with pork (well, not cooking, it was pre-made) for both of us, and she asked if we should add green onion. I said yes, and she put green onion as well as garlic. I told her the sauce already contains garlic, so we didn't need it. She said everyone did this so the broth doesn't smell. I told her we should follow the instructions of the package and only add condiment and when she didn't say anything, I fished the garlic out. After a moment, she said I should eat healthier and I just snapped. I said loudly that I did everything she wanted me to do, I ate rice mixed with vegetables (her most recommended diet) for three nights in a row before today. She replied that other people eat healthily  *everyday* and I said I did have something healthy today because I ate Greek yogurt with berries and almonds for breakfast (something else she insisted on). She didn't say anything for a moment before an, ""Alright, you win."" I kept going though, saying I can never win because if I eat unhealthy, she tells me to be healthier, if I eat healthy, she tells me to be healthier. 

Nothing happened after this, we ate together, and walked the dog together like we always do, laughing and talking. But I just want to know if I was the asshole or if it was a cultural difference where I don't like being commented so much on my diet while she doesn't mind.

Even with this being an anon account I have no experience with reddit even on my main (had to remake this and check on google docs because character limit even, sorry mods)

-For background I (19M) live with my two brothers Fish (22M) and Monkey (31M) in my parent's house. There is also my boyfriend (22M) and Fish's gf (23F). Fish and his gf just moved back in Wednesday and Monkey moved back home around September of last year.

-I am nowhere near as close to my brothers as I used to be, there is almost nothing I have in common with my brothers anymore outside of a few games I kinda like. When Fish was cleaning space for his room to be set up I expressed the fact that I was glad he was moving back in so that Monkey would be less lonely and not bother me as much because him and I got on eachother's nerves a lot.

-Fish had told Monkey about this the same day whether casually or intentionally I am unaware. But Monkey asked if we could have a genuine talk after. He asked if he did anything that made me upset and I was honest in saying that we have differing opinions and I don't really agree with the way he acts but I cannot fault him  for those things if that is simply how he is as a person.

-He then went on to explain his childhood. He explained how when his mother died he and his sister were separated by his mom's side of the family keeping his sister and him staying with our dad. He said how it sucked having a sibling taken from him and now when they talk she is like a stranger to him. He feels like they have nothing in common and have no real relationship since she lives far away. He said hearing that his own brother not wanting to do anything with him really hurt.

-I told him that he didn't have the right to expect sympathy or an apology from me because he actively pushed me away when I was younger in favor of Fish (long story). In the end I said his feelings were valid but I cannot apologize for hurting his feelings when I feel I did nothing wrong just because I like being left alone.

My (31F)’s little sister’s 29th birthday was in June. We will call her Lily for this story. Lily recently bought a house that she’s been fixing up and it’s gorgeous. One thing about my sister is she is the most creative person I know and the sweetest. 
        Like I said her birthday was in June, she’s not into parties so we just had dinner at her house with our family and her friends. She cooked dinner with was amazing as always. She got a few lovely gifts, our parents bought her a new chef knife set, her best friend got her a ring with their birthstones, and my husband and I got her some household cleaning supplies and a few things from a farmers market in our hometown: her favorite fruit and veggies, and some farm fresh flour. I had also purchased a couple cookbooks from a theft store I knew she’d use. Lily seemed really happy about the gifts and gave us really big hugs. 
          Everything was fine until I was talking to my SIL about it and she was disgusted with me and said that those weren’t gifts and I was horrible sister and left. For context my Lily and my SIL Haley have met a few times in the last 17 years I’ve been with my husband, my sister loves cooking and I thought they cleaning supplies was a good idea because she mentioned she needed to buy some a few days before her birthday. Haley said a real gift is jewelry, handbags, etc. 
       Lily hasn’t acted upset or offended and is still her chatterbox happy self. But what Haley said has gotten into my head and I’m wondering if those were proper gifts. When I mentioned it to my mom she said that the gifts were thoughtful but to ask Lily if she was upset. 
       Lily has a lot on her plate right now now so I don’t want to stress her out.

101,1ei2rt8,AITA For Causing a Shouting Match with my friend's Girlfriend at a Renaissance Festival?,"I'm new to Reddit, and my brother suggested I give it a try to get an outside perspective because it has been bothering me. 

I (22F) have been dreaming of attending a renaissance festival for a while. It's a big deal for me, and this year, I finally made it happen. I went with boyfriend Jake (23M) and my childhood friend, Tim (22M), who also joined us with his girlfriend, Melissa (21F). I've only met Melissa a handful of times, and our interactions have always been polite.

I spent weeks making my medieval-style dress, and I was excited to wear it. Jake and Tim also dressed up. Melissa came in regular clothes, which was fine, but she seemed annoyed from the start when we arrived at the festival.

The festival was amazing. Everything was amazing, and the overall atmosphere was incredible. But Melissa looked bored and loudly complained about everything. How hot it was, how silly the costumes were, and how expensive everything was. I tried to stay positive and enjoy myself, but her negativity was starting to eat at me.

As we were walking through the stalls, Melissa spilled her drink all over my dress. It was sticky and left a huge stain. She apologized, but it felt insincere, more like she was annoyed that I got teary-eyed than genuinely sorry. I tried to not think about it, but it was hard not to be upset.

Everything erupted when we reached a small performance stage. There was a group performing a music comedy thing, and we stopped to watch. As we were watching, Melissa kept loudly making sarcastic comments about how childish the whole thing was. Jake and I tried to ignore it, but then she started mocking the actors loudly enough for people around us to hear. Jake got uncomfortable, and I finally snapped and told her that if she didn’t like it, she didn’t have to be here.

Melissa then raised her voice at me, saying I was being a “queen” and being a snobby douche about the festival. I raised my voice also, trying to defend myself and my excitement for the festival. It quickly escalated into us shouting. Tim ended up shouting at me as well, saying I was being completely unfair and making Melissa feel like an outsider. The argument grew loud, and strangers started staring.

Jake started moving us back to the car and kept saying things like, ""Let's just calm down"" and ""This isn't worth fighting over"". He even suggested I apologize, which made me even more frustrated. Eventually, Jake decided to cut the day short for everyone.

The drive home was silent as I was still fuming. Tim didn’t speak to me, and Melissa kept giving me cold looks the whole drive back. It's been several weeks, and Tim and I haven’t spoken, and some of our mutual friends think that I was the one who ruined the day by taking things too seriously.

103,1ei2i9a,AITA for moving out when my sister said I was abandoning her after being her father figure her whole life?,"I (19 M) have a sister, Emma (16 F). To give a little backstory mine and Emma’s dad left when Emma was 4, abandoning our mother for another woman leaving her a single mother.

Growing up Emma and I were very close, and as we got older I found myself taking a paternal role with her, helping with her homework, picking her clothes, cooking while our mother worked.

 It became a routine in our family until my sophomore year in high school, my mother lost her job which was our main stream of income. This resulted in me having to get a job to help make ends meet. 

During this time I was battling mental health issues and hung around the wrong group. I ended meeting my then girlfriend who was a junior at the time. 

To make a long story short the relationship was very toxic and she ended getting pregnant, and decided to keep the baby. When my daughter, Olivia was 2 weeks old her mother abandoned us. Leaving our daughter with me, with this new responsibility I found my time being pulled from caring for Emma. 

I did my best to make time to hang out with her, but over the years I noticed her becoming more resentful towards me. At first it was small comments here and there, then she starting getting upset when I’d tend to my daughter. Our relationship became strained after that. 

I graduated from high school back in June and started looking for colleges. I found a community college a few hours away that wasn’t too expensive. The campus is a few minutes from my grandparents house so they offered to have me stay with them while attending classes, and they’d watch Olivia for me during the day. 

I was speaking with my mom about it to arrange a time where she was off work and we could move my stuff. When Emma walked into the room and over heard. Her reaction became upset when she heard and she started calling me “selfish” and “unfair”. 

For the next few weeks she continued this, but whenever I tried to explain she’d get upset and storm out of the room. 

A few days ago we were home alone around 9pm, while our mom worked. And Emma and I had gotten into an argument about me moving. It was starting to get heated when my daughter woke up and started calling for me. The last straw was when I went to get her Emma had said, I was an asshole just like our dad abandoning her when she needed me most. And that she wishes my daughter was never born.

Before I could say anything she stormed into her bedroom and slammed the door. Her words struck me deeply, and for the past few days she’s refused to come out of her room. 

After talking with my mom we’ve agreed it’d be best if I moved in with my grandparents earlier. And we’ve arranged to do it next weekend.

104,1ei28fc,AITA for not letting go of my dog? ,"For 12 years, Buddy, my German Shepherd, has been my loyal companion. Last week, his back legs gave out. Doctors found something growing inside him, pushing his organs and causing extra bone growth in his legs. He’s on medication, and I'm hoping for a recovery, but I’ve postponed searching for a second job to care for him.

I'm 21, working part-time, and figuring out my future. My brother (20) works with my father (39) at his successful company. I used to work there but left due to mental health issues, disappointing my family. They see me as a failure—21 with debt, no full-time job, no degree.

My father built his company from scratch after growing up in poverty with only a fourth-grade education. He had kids young and worked from age 10. I understand why he calls me a failure; he achieved so much with so little, while I struggle with much more.

When we moved to a small town, Buddy became my only friend. I was often left out and called names, growing up with self-hate that affects me even today. My father, often angry, would take it out on us and Buddy. My mom would lock Buddy in the laundry room, where he’d cry. I’d sneak to comfort him, walking, showering, and feeding him until he grew too strong for me. I feel guilty for neglecting him during my teenage years.

Buddy, now 12, has attacked two dogs and is aggressive with other animals but loves people and kids. It’s my fault for not socializing him enough, costing my mom thousands. Now, he can’t walk, so I help him with basic needs, give him medicine, and hope. He’s happy sometimes but frustrated when he can’t walk. He still cries for attention and waits with a smile for my family to come home.

My family thinks I should just let it go, saying he’s not worth it. My brother calls me a failure and questions my right to keep Buddy. I feel torn, as Buddy has been my lifeline through dark times.

105,1ei27s3,AITA for deciding to not celebrate my birthday?,"I’m (16f), having my birthday in less than a month. 

I’m a very tired person, my energy levels aren’t great as I am genuinely weary more than half the time. I am also an introvert with almost all people. This makes big social hangouts for me extremely exhausting and difficult to enjoy for longer periods of time. 

My younger sister (13f) and I share a birthday month, her birthday is a little less than a week before mine. I’ve seemed to noticed the pattern of her copying my birthday plans, for context I plan my birthday around two-ish weeks in advance so I have time to change my mind if need-be and this has been happening for a few years. My sister, normally through my mother, finds out about what I want to do, and decides she wants to do it for her birthday. I’ve talked with her before about how it makes me feel upset that it’s not really ‘my birthday activity’ anymore. I have tried keeping my plans away from her, but she has gone through my room and personal electronics before to know my plans. 

This year however, I’ve decided all I’d like to do is sit in my room alone, doing crafts and listening to music. (Something I personally enjoy).

My mother has repeatedly told me that I’m uncool and an asshole for not wanting to spend it with family and friends. And that I should ‘enjoy the early years’.  She now won’t talk to me before bringing up the fact that she has a loser for a daughter.

I’m a very tired person, my energy levels aren’t great as I am genuinely weary more than half the time. I am also an introvert with almost all people. This makes big social hangouts for me extremely exhausting and difficult to enjoy for longer periods of time. 

My younger sister (13f) and I share a birthday month, her birthday is a little less than a week before mine. I’ve seemed to noticed the pattern of her copying my birthday plans, for context I plan my birthday around two-ish weeks in advance so I have time to change my mind if need-be and this has been happening for a few years.

106,1ei1yml,AITA for laughing at my brother’s girlfriend’s psychoanalysis of me? ,"I [17m] am really into collecting colognes. I have 30+ full sized bottles as well as 50+ smaller sample sized decants (1-3 ml decants). Some of this admittedly is Christmas/birthday presents from friends and family, but I also buy with my own money, trade bottles I do have for bottles I want, and have a cologne review tiktok page that's popular enough for some companies to send me free bottles, so I don't want to give the impression of being daddy's money.

Anyways, my brother brought his girlfriend over, and I was giving her a tour of the house. We went to my room, she asked why I had so many cologne bottles, and I essentially said I always enjoy smelling new scents and am never satisfied that I've found *the best* scent when there's ones out there that I haven't smelt. 

She asked if I was a fuckboy, I said I don't think so, and asked why. She said based off of how I always felt the need to try out new colognes and could never settle with what I had being enough for me, I probably do the same with women. 

This made me laugh, and I asked if she had taken her first psych class or something. She got offended and asked me why I was laughing, and I admitted that I just frankly thought that was a really stupid analogy to make and inanimate objects and living humans aren't the same.

I (M22) am a anime fan from India and you may not know but buying anime merchandise in India is kinda hard due to low popularity. You can buy a anime tshirt or stickers from Amazon but that's it, if you want a action figure then it's either too expensive on Amazon or you have to buy them from shady websites that's why when I saw a ""Nezuko action figure"" on a stand during a carnival I bought it. It was a steal only 500inr (6.2usd) but as soon I got it a little girl (around 7-10 years old) started to crying to get that action figure, at first her mother tried to calm her and told ""a big brother already bought it"" but then that girl started to throw tantrum so now both her mother and the shop owner asking me to return the product so she can have it and told me I am too old to play with toys (bruh..) but well I said no and went back home and tell all these stuff to my mom but she said that same thing like I am too old for toys and I should had have that to that girl. Well I didn't care and put my action figure inside my pc on the GPU. Well after few week the son of one of my relatives came to my home with her mother and ask to play some games on my pc. I was like ""ok why not?..just don't break anything"" and opened a game for him and then my mom sent me to get sweets for the relatives when I returned I hand over the sweets the kid was beside her mother with big smile and the pc was already off.

108,1ei1tg1,AITA for asking my bf to skip family event for my birthday?,"For context, my bf (20M) and I (19F) have been together for 9.5 months now.  We were friends before getting together, and we have a very strong relationship.  With the few fights we’ve had, we always talk it out, but this one is one we keep seem to be having.

So, my bf was invited, alongside his whole family, to attend a wedding.  The wedding is for a family friend, or more specifically, my bf’s older sister’s best friend since childhood.  His sister is also her maid of honor I believe.  My bf has known the bride for a long time, but they aren’t necessarily close, and he’s never met the groom.  When the wedding invite came, his mom accepted on behalf of the whole family without asking anyone about previous commitments.  

Several months ago, he brought it up to me and said he had to go to this wedding, but he didn’t realize until then that it was the same date as my 20th birthday.  I wasn’t totally cool with the idea and I told him, so he apologized and said he’d talk to his mom.  He told me he has kept bringing it up over the past months that he couldn’t go to the wedding anymore, but he wasn’t sure he was being heard.  Fast forward to earlier this week, my bf told me he finally told his mom he can’t go to the wedding.  Something to note here as well is that on this same date is college move-in at our school, and two days before classes begin (we’re going into our junior years).  This would mean he couldn’t move in until the day before classes start, which isn’t ideal, so he mentioned this as the main reason.  Apparently, they got into a huge fight about it and now she isn’t talking to him at home.

I’d like to note I suggested, even before their fight, he just reach out to the bride himself, explain the situation, and then resolve it that way, but he hasn’t even attempted this.  Because he hasn’t acted on it, everything has had to go through his mom and she’s the one taking it personally.  She’s been known to not talk to him before, particularly after fights, so he is somewhat used to this, but it’s still hurtful to him.

So after everything, it seems like he still is going to go, and he said he would try to leave early, but he probably would miss my whole birthday and only arrive late at night.  As I write this, I can see how I’m the AH for hurting his relationship with his mom, especially since we haven’t even been together super long.  I could just spend the day with friends but, yes, selfishly I want him to spend the day with me.  If it was someone who he was close with getting married, like a sibling or best friend, then I’d gladly spend my birthday at the wedding with them but since he isn’t close with the wedding party and he won’t know most of them, it feels somewhat unjustified to me.

114,1ei07nx,AITA for going to see a movie by myself instead of going with my friend like the wanted,"The title might definitely not be helping me lol.

I had originally planned to go see a new movie with my friend,who I’ll call Danny. Danny and me had planned to go together as soon as we heard about the trailer being dropped,and made the plans indefinitely,that we were definitely gonna see it together. 
End of July comes around and I ask Danny about it,checking if he still wants to go,and he said he had made plans with our other friends to go see it but he didn’t mind seeing it two times (which is never something I like to hear when asking a friend to the movies) and we were in a place with a lot of people at the moment and people we knew,so of course I wasn’t gonna make a scene about it.

Now I’m Friends with both of the other two guys that Danny said he would be going to the movies with,let’s call them Hugh and Ryan (like the movie again lol) so it also doesn’t make sense for them to leave me out of stuff,which happens a lot more than I thought it did now that I’m typing it out

That night when I had gotten home from the place I was at with Danny,Ryan had called me to talk about something for a project he was doing,and he asked me what was wrong (thank you Ryan for being observant) and I had told him what Danny told me and my side of the story because Ryan isn’t the type to go tell someone that somebody else is upset with them.
When I had told Ryan that he said that he never actually agreed to go to the movies with Danny,and that he was actually going to see it with his dad,which meant Danny had lied to me,but at that point I was still hopeful(which is so dumb of me🤦‍♀️)

So at that point I had made plans to go see the movie by myself,and the night I saw it I had called Ryan to tell him about how good I thought it was and Ryan told me that our friend Hugh was also in the theater with him,they weren’t going together but they had saw it the same day and both went with family. Which meant to me that Danny hadn’t saw it yet and neither of these guys were the people to see something twice so he probably wasn’t gonna be able to see it with friends. Which Ill admit I felt bad for a minute,but you also should tell people to fact check your lies if you know I have their phone numbers 

And currently today the topic of the movie came up when I was talking to Danny and he told me he wouldn’t be able to see it for awhile now because of nobody wanting to go with him,and he told me that I was a jerk and that I should’ve waited to see it with him,and I reminded him that he told me he was gonna see it with our other friends instead, which he got mad about that I called him out on his lies (obviously😒)

So at that point I had made plans to go see the movie by myself,and the night I saw it I had called Ryan to tell him about how good I thought it was and Ryan told me that our friend Hugh was also in the theater with him,they weren’t going together but they had saw it the same day and both went with family. Which meant to me that Danny hadn’t saw it yet and neither of these guys were the people to see something twice so he probably wasn’t gonna be able to see it with friends. Which Ill admit I felt bad for a minute,but you also should tell people to fact check your lies if you know I have their phone numbers 

And currently today the topic of the movie came up when I was talking to Danny and he told me he wouldn’t be able to see it for awhile now because of nobody wanting to go with him,and he told me that I was a jerk and that I should’ve waited to see it with him,and I reminded him that he told me he was gonna see it with our other friends instead, which he got mad about that I called him out on his lies (obviously😒)

I don’t think I’m the asshole but Danny obviously called me one anyways,I mean if you can’t keep your lies straight why lie bro",0.0,0.9731239676475524,1,0
115,1ei0776,AITA for accepting firewood from the neighbor all my other neighbors hate?,"I’ve (F29) lived on a street for the past year with mostly older people who keep to themselves but are pretty friendly and well acquainted with everyone else. I’ve had zero drama or beef with any of these people and am happy to chitchat when I see them outside. I rent and everyone else owns their homes. I live alone and work remote. I literally could not be a quieter neighbor beside for occasional hydraulic firewood splitting that I do on Saturdays after 11am. 

Recently an arborist moved in across the street and at first everyone was stoked because we live in an environment that gets tons of snowfall and quite a few of the homes (mine and the next door neighbor’s (Fred)) are heated by wood burning stoves. Well the arborist began parking large trucks and various machinery in the vacant lot next to his house that he also owns and coming and going super early in the morning and apparently waking the neighbors. There’s been something of a neighborhood movement to have the arborist expelled or something. There’s no HOA so not sure the movement is going anywhere. 

A bit about Fred and I’s relationship: the people I’m renting from warned me that he has a terrible temper and owns a lot of guns (too long of a story to unpack there). But Fred and I have always been really friendly. He came over to help me out during a massive snow storm to make sure my gas valves were clear and even helped me blow my driveway. I brought him some nice pastries in return. 

I listen when the neighbors gripe to me about it and once there was this weird verbal altercation between Fred and the arborist that I accidentally got in the middle of (once I realized what was going on I literally said “I don’t want to be involved in this, I’m just here to ski”). But frankly it doesn’t bother me, the trucks have never woken me. I am a renter and don’t have much of a dog in the fight, but I can understand why the homeowners would be upset by their street being used as a home base for a commercial tree service. 

The arborist recently offered me logs an d to cut them to size for me. For perspective firewood can run $300-$500 a cord. I go through almost 4 cords a winter. At around 5 pm today he put them in my drive way and while he was moving the logs around with a crane Fred came out and was pretty visibly annoyed with me. I went over to talk to him, he didn’t yell at me but was like “what are you doing we are trying to get these guys kicked out”. I was like “listen, he offered to cut them to size for me, I’m just a renter and fire wood is expensive. I asked them to wait until Saturday to chainsaw.” He went inside and was on the phone fuming to someone. And now I have massive anxiety that the neighborhood hates me. AITA? 

EDIT: btw I LOVE where I live. Amazing deal that lets me ski to my heart’s desire but have also mostly enjoyed the people I live around to this point. Not interested in burning any bridges.

118,1ehzzy4,AITA For Skipping My Sister's Funeral?,"I (26F) skipped my sister's (29F) funeral. Her appendix burst two weeks ago, something unexpected and a death that would have been tragic had it been someone else. However, I was not interested in hearing another kind word said about her, as I've done plenty of listening to people sing her praise in her lifetime. 

Growing up, my mother pit the two of us against each other most of the time. We grew up dancers, and often times our mom compared our appearances, and our talent, while also framing us as academic rivals. I was never the favorite, with my sister receiving most of the attention from our mother. 

To put it all into frame, growing up, my mother would spend exorbitant amounts on my sister's birthday parties, we're talking thousands. For me, I'd get a sleepover in the basement. My mother never gave me an opportunity to believe for a second that I wasn't the least favorite child. I knew that funerals would have been the same operation. My mother spent so much money on my sister's funeral that she is now requiring me to pay rent to live in our house. If it had been my death, she would've skimped on every cost.

My sister and I were never close, as my mother drove a thick wedge between us. I didn't feel as though I owed her any attention in death, as she took all of my attention in life. She and I would go out to lunch once a month together but the conversation was always stale and I felt consumed by envy whenever we spoke. I feel less like mourning her death, and instead like celebrating the newfound freedom I'll have without her in my life.

My dad is now threatening to kick me out of the home because I didn't appear at my sister's funeral, which was on Sunday (7/28). He says that it was selfish and that in this moment our rivalry shouldn't have mattered. I disagree and think that I was valid in protecting my peace and avoiding the pity party over my sister.

Before that, the past November she sent me a nasty text really just putting me down when trying to help her after she asked for my help. Well since their break-up, he has taken her children like they are his.

My FIL has let them call him dad and has even let Tina move into his home. He has even let Tina drive his car around because her vehile is broken down. My SIL needs it more with a new baby and no reliable vehicle but the one night he let my SIL drive it, he took it away from her saying Tina needed it more. Both my husband and myself were outraged when that happened because he chose Tina over his own daughter.

Recently I have been made aware by many of my husband and my friends that hey have seen Tina and FIL at the local bar together acting like they are in a sexual relationship. I don't have proof just word of mouth. Both my husband and I think it is completely disgusting and inappropriate as Tina is the same age as my SIL.

He wanted me to stay over Monday, I originally agreed, but my schedule changed last minute and I had to go in at 4 a.m. so I cancelled on him so I could go to sleep early the night before and wake up at 2 a.m. He asked if I could come over afterwards and I said I would see how I feel, but wasn’t guaranteeing anything. I texted him a few hours later that I wasn’t going to be able to come over because I was exhausted and had to go in at 4 a.m. again the next day. He said he understood. 
Skip to today, he wanted me to come over again. He had a work meeting over 2 hours away and wanted me to wait for him at his house til he got home. I work two jobs, I take one day off every single week to guarantee I can get my home stuff done (meal prep, laundry, cleaning, etc) and he knows that. I got everything done and was planning on going over there around 6 p.m. I checked his location and he was still at his work meeting so he wouldn’t get back home until after 8 tonight. It was raining extremely heavy at the time and so I was going to wait it out (Florida rainy season ≠ anxiety of driving in heavy rain. Not a good mesh). I texted him and I let him know it may be best to wait another night since it was raining heavy and he wouldn’t be home until late. 
He then texted me that he was upset because I kept getting his hopes up and cancelling on him and he was blowing up my phone. I answered a phone call and hung up on him out of rage since he said that I “didn’t put the effort in to see him” and would “only see him when it’s a convenience to me.” This upset me since I’m always the one that drives down to his house and he never come up to my apartment or even offers to. Then he continued to say that my anxiety gets in the way of our quality time. This is the first day I’ve ever cancelled due to my fear of driving in heavy rain, every other time I’ve made the drive in rain, it takes me exponentially longer because I have to pull over most times.

122,1ehzsmy,AITA for Refusing to Leave a Restaurant? ,"I (35F) and my husband (33M) went to a Mexican restaurant in we hadn’t tried in our city. It’s important to mention my husband is Mexican and I am white, and he has higher standards for Mexican food than I do. 

We ordered our meals and it was clear that the wait staff was new, and the restaurant was pretty Americanized but otherwise no issues placing an order and getting drinks. 

Then the food took a long time (over 30 minutes)  and he started to get mad. We tried the chips and salsa to tie us over but the salsa tasted sour. We let the waitress know it had gone bad, but she brought us another from the same batch so we left it. Once our food arrived, mine was decent but his was cold, so he sent it back. Then when it came out and it was still room temperature and he gets up and demands we leave. Starts freaking out/pacing and doesn’t want to stay. I offer some of mine and he refuses to eat it. 

He ended up sitting down and they reheated the food, but was pissed at me not supporting his decision to leave saying it was an insult to give these people our money. 

AITA for not supporting my husband here? In my life, I have never left a restaurant. You just don’t go back if it’s bad in my opinion and we already communicated our concerns to the wait staff and they took the feedback and fixed it. The food was edible, and I think I just find the idea of walking out overly dramatic. 

Edit: 

Thanks for the feedback! Understood I’m TA! I already apologized to him after. Should have asked for his meal to be comped at least. 

Couple notes for questions in the comments: 
1. The salsa was bottled salsa that came to the table as a side. Likely just stored incorrectly. Probably why I was less reactive since it wasn’t necessarily obvious to servers or kitchen it was sour. 

2. Didn’t consider asking for a manager. Kitchen was very small and the only server said it was her 3rd day. Maybe there was someone in the back but didn’t ask. 

3. Totally am a people pleaser! Someone could push me and I would probably apologize for being in the way and assume the best. My husband is hot blooded so we usually balance each other out but I think under reacted trying to calm him down.

123,1ehzpep,AITA for giving my friend the cold shoulder after exposing one of my biggest secrets?,"this all happened a couple of days ago. i had a cake cutting for my birthday with my two friends DJ and Stephanie. as we were chatting, DJ confessed to me that she had been keeping a secret from me for awhile. 

for context, i have a stalker account on instagram. it is not used for any creepy things like DMing inappropriate things to other users  or scamming. i also use it for stalking shows i watch and seeing edits as I don’t really want it on my main because this takes up almost my whole fyp and i like having other reels like cooking so i keep it separate. it is also just an account i used to view stories and posts anonymously. the presumed gender for the account is he/him and the - school name’year -in the bio. 

apparently  DJ’s friend (Michelle) made a post awhile ago and one of her friends had commented “OMG MICHELLE U LOOK SO GOOD!!!” according to DJ, i had liked the comment on my stalker account (i went back to check to see if i had done this and i did not see a like from it. it’s possible i liked and unliked it by accident because i do have a habit of liking random comments by swiping fast on accident including on my main. i always unlike when i accidentally do though so i may have just forgot i had accidentally liked it). 
basically michelle saw this, got excited a boy thought she was pretty and immediately wanted to know who he was. i think since i liked the comment and unliked it quickly when i realized she got a notification. she screenshotted it and immediately sent it to a class group chat to try to figure it out. she also proceeded to tell DJ about this boy who thought she was pretty and DJ told her it was me and all about my secret account. 

i was kinda mad ngl because i don’t think that was her secret to share in the first place. DJ was adamant that Michelle was entitled to know because a random person liked the comment and is her friend. i thought my alliance to her would be stronger since we have been besties since fifth grade and are in the same friend group while DJ met Michelle in ninth grade, but i guess not. i don’t feel like that’s a very good reason because she promised me she wouldn’t tell anyone. the best example i can think of is a secret valentine. obviously if you receive one you’d like to know who it’s from but it’s secret so if someone knows they shouldn’t tell you unless the secret admirer is fine with it. it also bothered me that she didn’t ask if it’s fine. 

her argument was that it was 2 AM and i was asleep when they were texting. DJ apparently made Michelle promise not to snitch but i’ve met Michelle and she’s kinda a blabbermouth. she talks about MANY people. i’m sure i’m bound to be exposed.  DJ claims i’m just overreacting and it’s not big deal since Michelle has one too but the thing is NOBODY KNOWS MICHELLE’S ACCOUNT IS HER. i’m honestly second guessing myself by her reaction. i know it wasn’t truly a big secret but it was for me. am i just overreacting?

124,1ehznhs,AITA for canceling my one and only meeting Friday with IT for a round of golf?,"Hello! 

For context, I (39M) am a PM & Senior Engineer in a large firm and regularly work 40+ hrs a week. If I’m not in a meeting, I’m usually going into another meeting. If I have free time, I’m curious if its cause I missed a meeting or did I book myself a meeting so I can get some of my own work done. 

Fast forward to tomorrow, first day in weeks where I literally had no meetings booked and a buddy of mine invited myself to play a round of golf early AM with two others. Taking this opportunity!

I realize quickly after that this guy in IT asked me my availabilities this week to install a software I requested weeks ago. “When’s good for you?” I said Friday 9am. He never confirmed nor booked it in my calendar (or vice versa). I write to him quickly yesterday saying, “golfing Friday, let’s try next week”. 

Within moments, he closes my ticket and says “have tried several times to no avail, re request it when you need it”. 

Now, when I requested it weeks ago, I needed it then but ended up finding a way around to use other softwares to get the information required. So my request now isn’t urgent but when I need it again, it should already be there. Also, they only reached out once after two weeks of my ticket being open. When I mentioned it’s not an urgent matter and I have no spare time this week, next week, IT guy is “I’m on vacation” no sweat! When you’re back.

So, after he closes it, I request that it’s reopened as it’s not been fulfilled. I’m not opening another request when this one is still valid. He’s like, “we are too busy to be waiting or chasing anyone around”. 

Emails going a bit back and forth about specific details, (I asked you on this date, you said no, I actually requested this date, didn’t respond for two weeks, was supposed to be installed when I got the laptop, etc etc… in the end, nothing really comes out of it. Would have literally been easier to just reopen the request.  

So, am I the A for asking IT to reschedule a 15 minute meeting for next week so I can play golf?

My (15f) older cousin (31f) hasn’t taught her younger boys who are 5 and 7 how to flush the toilet yet and it annoys me. I’m on a family trip and have been dealing with this for about 5 days now. 

I’ll wake up and walk into the bathroom to either do my skincare or use the bathroom and when I look into the toilet I see that someone took a dump and just left it there to marinate overnight. I don’t completely know if it’s her kids but I’ve seen them walk into the bathroom to use it and walk out without flushing. I’ve asked them politely to flush it a few times but I’m getting tired because it happens all the time. 

I’ve talked to my cousin few times in the past week and she just says “They’re kids, they don’t know any better” or she’ll just get mad at me because “they’re not my kids which means it’s not my problem” which just makes me mad because it’s kind of my problem when the bathroom smells terrible and there’s someone’s un-flushed business in the toilet. we also share this house with at least 5 or 6 of our other family members.

I’m not sure if I’m in the wrong for having high expectations for her kids, especially because I’ve never had any of my own.

129,1ehxyzn,WIBTA if I don’t pay back the student loans I told my parents I would?,"For context, my mother, 61F, and I, 24F, have had a strained relationship since my adolescence. We never got along, even in my early childhood, as she did not know how to respond to or express emotions healthily.

My family could not afford college out of pocket, so we took out loans to finance it. I took out $24k in federal student loans, and my mother, to cover the difference, took out $44k in federal parent loans to supplement the rest. We had a conversation and agreed that when the time came, I would be responsible for paying them back.

The issues arose when, in 2022, she banned me from attending Christmas with her and my father because I wouldn't also stay for New Year's, and I made the decision to cut contact with her as the final straw to an already toxic relationship. We did not speak for 6 months until she came to my apartment and attempted to make amends. During this time, there was a federal loan freeze, so repayment was not in consideration. We began communicating again during 2023 and 2024, and during that time, the loans entered repayment. We agreed that due to my financial position, as I am paying back the loans I took out in my name myself ($200/month), she would help pay back some of the loans in her name, but I still need to contribute a decent amount to her loan monthly repayment ($150 out of the $600 payment). Because she wants me to handle it, she transfers me money monthly to pay it off, so the loan payments are connected to my bank account.

She and my father came to visit me a month and a half ago, and she had a meltdown similar to the one she did a few years ago that was the catalyst for me no longer speaking to her. I told her that we needed to reduce communication, but my last phone call with her 3 weeks ago made me realize that I had to go full no contact based on the way she was acting and continues to act. I have been ignoring her calls and texts since. I noticed that the wire from last month did not come in, and I simply cannot afford the student loan payments on my own. She does not have the login for the account, so she can’t do anything at the moment.

The idea of communicating with her for any extended period is soul-sucking, but I’m tied to them through a family credit card, so I do not want to harm my own credit score if the loans go into default. I don't want to pay the loans back because of our current situation, but I feel like I am the asshole if I don't based on principle. WIBTA if I tell her I can't afford the payments and suggest she repay it on her own while I instead transfer her $200 every month to cover the portion I was paying to stick to my word and to avoid the loans going into default?

  
Edit: 

To clarify, financial points:

1.I was added as an authorized user to build my credit early, but I do not have access to the credit card or any financial supports outside of this connection since post covid. 

2. She took out a ""Parent Plus Loan"", so the loan is completely in her name. I only pay it out of my own account after the money is transferred because she prefers that I handle it. The loan I took out under my name is 100% my responsibility and I am currently paying off.

On the relationship front to provide additional context, she was very emotionally volatile growing up to put it mildly, which obviously contuned into adulthood, and I could no longer take the constant toxicity and instability, which is why I initially went no contact. I thought she had changed, so I give her another chance, but based on our most recent inreactiohns, that was proven to be not the case, so I decided going no contact again, would be a better choice.

My best friend/roomate (24F) and I (23F) have been on the outs for almost a month now. It all started because she was late for work and came into my room at 6am asking what she should do. I told her to get ready as fast as she can and get there as soon as possible (we are both flight attendants). Later in the day she comes home and won’t speak to me and our other roommate tells me that my best friend is pissed because I didn’t take her to work and she had to Uber. She also mentions that my best friend asked me to take her when she never did. I would have 100% taken her if she would have just asked but it was 6am and I was tired from work the day before and wasn’t even thinking. I went out with friends a couple nights later and drank a little too much and told her it was unfair to blame me for something that wasn’t in my control and to blatantly lie. Things got heated and I called her a bitch. I immediately felt bad and started apologizing and even apologized again the next day. She said that we just needed to talk about it again in person. I went on vacation and then on short term leave so I was not at our apartment. Well I come back and she is acting like everything is fine but I still feel so uneasy and still so bad. We are both busy so have barely seen each other since. However, the other day I find out that my best friend and our other roommate booked everything on a trip to Greece without telling me and this is something we have had planned for a while now. I have been so extremely hurt since finding this out. I texted her and asked if they had already booked everything and her only response was “yes we have”. This was supposed to be a trip with us three and I feel extremely disappointed and sad that I was no longer included in it. Is what I said that horrible? We’ve never even had a disagreement before this. I just can’t shake this feeling, she’s my best friend.

I would have 100% taken her if she would have just asked but it was 6am and I was tired from work the day before and wasn’t even thinking. I went out with friends a couple nights later and drank a little too much and told her it was unfair to blame me for something that wasn’t in my control and to blatantly lie. Things got heated and I called her a bitch. I immediately felt bad and started apologizing and even apologized again the next day. She said that we just needed to talk about it again in person. I went on vacation and then on short term leave so I was not at our apartment. Well I come back and she is acting like everything is fine but I still feel so uneasy and still so bad. We are both busy so have barely seen each other since. However, the other day I find out that my best friend and our other roommate booked everything on a trip to Greece without telling me and this is something we have had planned for a while now. I have been so extremely hurt since finding this out. I texted her and asked if they had already booked everything and her only response was “yes we have”. This was supposed to be a trip with us three and I feel extremely disappointed and sad that I was no longer included in it. Is what I said that horrible? We’ve never even had a disagreement before this. I just can’t shake this feeling, she’s my best friend.

I frequently treat my staff every weekend as a gift to show my appreciation for all their hard work and as a way for them to bond by spending time together after work and would usually prepay at the restaurant ahead/event/purchase tickets to whatever they would be going to.

For some reason this time, they requested if they can just get CASH equivalent of whatever restaurant I would be treating them to for the weekend.

I was caught offguard.  
  
I felt a ~~bit~~ bad as it made me feel that they do not appreciate me wanting to pay for their get togethers. Aside from that I do not even think there would be many other companies would offer weekly get togethers for the staff for free.

Because I felt bad. I told them that it is meant as a gift and if they dont want to have a get together might as well cancel and still I will not give away cash.

133,1ehwsgi,AITA for refusing to be around my sisters toxic relationship while pregnant? ,"My sister is 21F, her GF is 26F,  I am 24F 

Im currently pregnant (10weeks) and my family (father and sister) are coming to see me at the end of august as I live in a different state (across the country) and I start school soon. I live with my husband and his two daughters from a previous relationship, so I can't come visit my family for most holidays because we take care of his children together and I don't think Ill be able to handle the stress of holiday traveling along with school and being pregnant. So my family has planned to come see me, my mom is coming at the beginning of the month and my father and sister are coming at the end of the month. Now, my sister has been in a toxic relationship with her girlfriend for the last maybe 4/5 months. They met in barber school. They quite literally broke up a few days ago and my sister proceeded to talk to her ex in the day that they were broken up for. My sisters girlfriend is extremely mentally and emotionally unstable. She's also kinda emotionally abusive to my sister, (ex. they fall asleep together on the phone every night, one time my sister hung up an hour early in the morning to study for a test, and her girlfriend fought with her the entire day about it. My sister was staying with me at the time, so then she was mean to me the entire day because of fighting with her girlfriend.) So now (a few days after they broke up and got back together) my sister told me that she's bringing her girlfriend and asked if the needed to get a hotel. (Her coming was not the question, getting a hotel was because she usually stays in my guest room) In my eyes (I am autistic so please be honest if I am wrong) it's inconsiderate to me to even invite her without asking me or even consider it. I will admit that I was quite mean in my response. Im pregnant, I see my family maybe once a year and I only wanted to spend time with my sister. I do not want to be around someone who's manipulative towards her while I am pregnant. I dont want to be exposed to unnecessary negativity and toxicity. I also did not want her coming alone and then being rude to me the entire time because of her girlfriends constant drama. I genuinely was hoping they'd just stay broken up, my sister was talking to her ex and even said that she just stayed with her out of not wanting to be alone for 10days while my mom was visiting me (sister lives with mom). I just don't understand it. I don't get why she'd even suggest it when she knows that Im pregnant and only wanted to spend time with her. It genuinely hurt my feelings that she even wants to bring her, as this might be the last time we get to see each other before my baby gets here and my life changes forever. But I genuinely have a hard time understanding people so please tell me.

135,1ehwpsa,AITAH for asking my mom why her friend gave them expensive stuffs but only gave me a cheap scarf gotten from a local market ,"A week ago, my mom and I traveled to Paris and her friend offered we stay at her place. Two days ago my sister came and when she was leaving she gave my sister two expensive perfume and skin care products, also $200 which is equivalent to 320k in my country and then she gave my mom 3 expensive perfumes and skin care products but she gave me just a scarf she she said she got from a market in India. I know I should be grateful and I sound so ungrateful right now but I can’t help but be upset. I’ve tried to look  at the bright side like Atleast I got something but I can’t help but wonder why she just gave me the scarf and nothing else. Maybe I’m the AH for getting upset but I can’t help it. Did I annoy her or something or did she think I wouldn’t want any of what he gave my mom and sister. I’m just curious. 

When I asked my mom why her friend did this, she got upset saying I wasn’t being appreciative, Atleast she let you stay in her house and all that but she also stayed in the same house, as well as my sister but they got way more stuffs than I did. I saw the argument wasn’t going to end well so, I ended it quickly. Whether or not I’m at fault here, it’s fine. I just want to know why. 

Update: Thankyou everyone for the comments and telling me where I Was wrong or your opinions, it was much appreciated 🥰🙂. I came here to hear the truth which I already knew but I needed to hear it from other people so I would stop thinking the way I did so Thankyou for making me realize my mistakes 

Another update: Since I can't really reply to every single comment right now. I hope everyone who commented sees this, for those saying it was my behavior, let me makes things straight. My sister actually spent more time in her room than I did actually, though I'm way more quiet and shy than she is, I tried to mingle more than she did,I was in the room most of the time but so was she. just when she did she talked more than I did, as for the helping I never knew it was offensive to help people's workers, I mean I grew help hearing my parents say even if they work for you or they do something for you it's still good to help back, so I'm surprised now that someone is saying that not the case. My mom was even complaining I wasn't even helping enough. I don't even think its actually about my behavior because my whole life this is how I've been treated even within my family where everyone says She doesn't care about such things right so no need to bother. I think the first time I even told my mom how differently they treated me in such situations she said it's probably because you come off as someone who isn't bothered about this kinds of things, so no one will think to give you this things. She said when your siblings don't get something they complain so next time we know to give them but you never complain at all so we just assume it means you Dont want it then. So if it's about bad behavior that I know I don't have. And me not talking is also not it. Because believe me all the friends I've ever made in my life I made them from me not talking not me talking in fact I've made way less friends now that I actually talk than when I never used to talk to people. I'm not defending myself, I'm just further explaining things. And my sister actually mingled more with my mom and I actually mingled more with them, my sister would only be there if my mom was also there with them, I would stick around whether or not my mom was there with them or not. If I heard them talking about something that didn't concern me, I would move a way. But everyone who knows me knows I Dont talk much but it doesn't mean I don't want to be there or hang out or I'm trying to be rude.

137,1ehwidl,AITA for leaving a friend's party early?,"Last Thursday was my (20F) good friend, Jack's, 18th birthday. We've been in the same friend group of 7 for a little under a year, and have gotten very close over time. About three weeks ago, Jack texted all of us and asked if we were available to do something for his birthday, even if it wasn't on the actual day since it was just important to him that we were all able to go. We set the date for the Saturday after his birthday and planned to go over to his house for a little while for dinner and cake.

Before the day came, though, my boyfriend of about 4 months invited me to his parents' house for dinner on the same day. I accepted, figuring that the party at Jack's wouldn't last that long and I would be able to make it to my boyfriends as well. I did not mention the party to my boyfriend, since I knew he would be upset about not being invited, so I told him I would just be dropping off Jack's present for him.

After I had been at Jack's for about two hours my boyfriend texted me to ask if I would still be coming over for dinner, and when I told him I was still at Jack's he began to argue with me, saying that a drop off shouldn't take so long.

I replied and said I would leave then, and I had just been waiting for Jack to play the scratch-offs I got him. I told everyone I had to go to my boyfriend's house for dinner instead since he was upset with me. Looking back, they all seemed very put off, but I didn't notice at the time.

I told them I would not let something like that happen again, and he needed to work on his jealousy. This is a bit my fault, but I didn't actually end up confronting him about it much, and only briefly mentioned that he can't do anything like that again.

Now is where I may be TA: one of the girls in the group (20f, I'll call her Daisy) texted me this morning to tell me that what I did was shitty and that I hurt Jack's feelings by leaving. I didn't think about it at the time, but now I'm wondering if leaving was the wrong thing to do.

138,1ehwhzf,WIBTA for not inviting my friend to a concert?,"On my parents anniversary my favorite artist was in town for one night. My friend asked her parents on a whim if they would take her. Not knowing if they would have seats they went. When I asked my parents if they would take me (we are not old enough to drive) they said it was too late and if I had asked earlier we would have gone. 

My parents instead bought 4 tickets to a artist we like as a family so I could bring a friend (I am an only child). When I told our friend groups gc about me going to the concert but not about how I could invite somebody, only the girl going to the concert responded. So I would assume she knows who the band is and feel like I have to invite her but I want to invite somebody else who wanted to go to the concert that she went to but like me couldn't. 

If other girls couldn't go to the concert I might tell my parents to either a) bring one of their friends or b) have me not go and bring a friend and their SO. But I feel like my parents would be hurt if I didn't go or say I was being a brat not inviting her. 

I know I will probs be the ahole but on another not what should I do?",TL;DR,2024-08-02,"WIBTA for not inviting my friend to a concert?

139,1ehw658,"AITA for telling my BIL and SIL to Fuck off, and should i apologise? ","Bare with me, I’m not good at putting my thoughts into words so this may not make much sense or possibly be all over the place. 😂 welcome to my brain. 

I live on a farm with my partner and kids. We have 2 dogs, pure breed boarder collie (Zeus 1 year old ) and pure breed maremma (Apollo roughly 13 weeks old), 9 chickens and 2 lousy guinea fowls 😅.  Last Sunday, (28th July) my BIL and SIL came out with their kids and dog. Always enjoy them being out here, cousins playing etc, etc, but we always have an issue because their dog chases my poultry, every time it happens I’m having to catch the chickens and lock them up so they don’t get eaten. 
So obviously without fail their dog begins chasing the chickens. Which all they do is yell the dogs name which does nothing, So I finally snapped, I got up and grabbed their dog put its leash on it and told them to fuck off and no more dogs are allowed here. Which had their response of ‘she didn’t chase the chickens, blah blah blah’, like I wasn’t sitting there next to them and witness the thing chase them. So they packed up their kids and dog and my other BIL dog as well and left. 
BIL sent my partner a message saying they will not be back out here until I apologise for being an asshole. I don’t think I’m an asshole at all, partner also doesn’t think I’m an asshole. 

My oldest daughter is 7 in 2 weeks, and obviously I’d love for her cousins to attend, but they’ll only start talking to us again if I apologise. Should I? 
So what do strangers on the internet think 🤔

Edit to add-.
I should mention that they only come out to our farm probably 2 times a month. Most times is them stopping in on their way home from somewhere, as mentioned in a comment, this dog is a third child so it goes everywhere with them. There’s been a few times that we’ve asked them to leave the dog home and they’ve just brought it with them.

Outcome- Im gonna apologise for the tone, and the way I told them to fuck off, but I’m not apologising, nor am I changing my mind on the dogs being banned. And then that’s up to them whether they’ll accept my apology. If not, no skin from my nose 🤷🏼‍♀️.  ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-02,"AITA for telling my BIL and SIL to Fuck off, and should i apologise?

140,1eikq73,"AITA for telling my SIL off after she got upset that me being a ""new"" father means her kids will get less attention? ","I (37M) was recently informed that I'm a father. My daughter is 16 years old, and the result of a tryst with an older woman when I was 20. This is not a brag, it's simply informative. It wasn't a random one-night stand, we weren't strangers, we had known each other for several months up until that point and continued talking for almost a year afterward. Just never told me. Also, it wasn't an affair. I don't know why she never told me.

I met my daughter for the first time recently, and everything went well. We've been communicating almost daily via text. She's excited to get to know me, holds no resentment against me because she understands that I was never informed of her existence at all, and is excited to meet the paternal side of her extended family. All in all, everything went so much better than I was expecting. She's the spitting image of me, but we did a test just to be absolutely certain and the results proved that she is indeed my daughter 😁 We'll call her M. 

So obviously, I announced this news to my family. My sister was the first one I told, because she has been my Confidant since we were in high school and we don't keep anything from each other. But with M's blessing, I have also informed other family. My oldest niece, the daughter of my sister, is excited because now all of a sudden she has an older girl cousin. Very big deal for a 10 year old.


The problem is my SIL (22F). We'll call her S. I'm not a rich guy, but as a bachelor I do alright for myself. I have a tendency to spoil my nieces and nephews with candy and sometimes toys when I visit. Well, my youngest niece, the daughter of my brother and S, recently had a birthday party. A lot of the extended family was there, including my own grandparents. Closer to the end of the party, S made a comment about how I didn't even know that M existed for 16 years and it shouldn't be such a big deal that she becomes part of my life now, because I was fine without her for so long and vice versa. She said she just doesn't understand why I'm making it such a big deal. Well, despite the fact that I'm generally very slow to anger and always have been, I unloaded on her. I said some things that I shouldn't have, that I now regret, and left the party. S has been texting me all week about how terrible I am for what I said. My brother is on her side because it's his wife, but my sister is on my side because I was provoked. Our parents haven't been involved, but S has obviously told hers because they've texted me as well.

Edit: I said that she was being a selfish bitch and was too dense and blonde to understand why it's a big deal for me even if she doesn't think it is.

Edit 2: some of y'all are real hung up on the blonde part. Understand that this was said in anger and in the heat of the moment. I understand that is was too far. 

Edit 3: important note, the comment made at the party was not the first comment. She'd been making passive aggressive comments all last week, which I ignored.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-02,"AITA for telling my SIL off after she got upset that me being a ""new"" father means her kids will get less attention?
