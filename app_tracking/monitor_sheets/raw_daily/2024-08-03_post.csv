0,1eip7s7,AITA if I confront one of my best friend about trying to get with my boyfriend?,"A year ago my best friend 18f met her current boyfriend 19m. There was some hesitation from my friends side because she didn’t want to settle down into a relationship because she was talking to multiple guys at the same time and in her words he was ugly. This was said on multiple occasions but I didn’t say anything because she tends to be a judgmental person. 

They started going out after 4 months and have been together since. The problem started when I 18f went with her and her boyfriend to go see her boyfriend brother 22m. On the way home I mentioned the fact that I thought he was cute and she agreed with me saying I wish my boyfriend looked like him.

That weekend his brother went to pick her up so that they could spend time together. Later that day the brother added me on Instagram and we started talking. For two months while me and 22m  were speaking she made snarky remarks about how we would never end up together. 

We eventually started to go out with only made her comment worse she would tell me how he let her put her head on her shoulder and how he was supposedly speaking to many other girls she had no proof so I didn’t believe her. In the last couple weeks she has been repeatedly texting my boyfriend trying to get them to hang out just the two of them.

I honestly don’t know if I’m being dramatic and that there is nothing wrong here or if I should talk to her about it. AITAH?

 after that he started talking to me more but it would just be about that game and the characters in it, now im not a gamer and i wasn't really interested but i still listened because i love him and care for him alot, i even searched that game up on reddit to see what its all about.
After that he sent me 30 min long youtube videos about the character's arc and I didn't have time to watch them since i'm in medical school (meanwhile he works from home) and had exams so i'd tell him every day that id watch it tomorrow but i never found the time.
Today he told me if it was between saving me and that character he would save him and I found this a really hurtful statement and told him and he said it was a joke and i didnt understand it because i dont know the context since i didn't watch the youtube vids and that proves im not interested in his hobbies and now i shouldn't complain about him not initiating conversations ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-03,"AITA for not being interested in my bfs interests?

2,1ejgz05,AITA for not accommodating neighbor and turning off dryer,"I rent half a duplex in the PNW with a small backyard space that belongs to my neighbor who rents the second half. My washer/dryer vents into the back space. For years they have been fairly crap neighbors with a range of complaints from my infant being too loud (they have two children plus a loud yapping dog) to my dryer venting lint into the backspace (I had it repaired). The latest is their request that I not run the dryer at all midday while their kids play outside because it creates heat. When they first asked, I was so caught off guard and like a people-pleasing millennial said I would see what I could do, but couldn’t commit to that. In one week alone, they’ve texted me four times asking me to turn off the dryer because their kids were either outside or wanted to go outside to play. AITA for not responding and letting the dryer finish its cycle?

Side question: my preference would be to live side by side and not deal with each other. I don’t want to rock the boat and create animosity, but I also want to say something to the effect that it’s unreasonable for them to expect me to turn off the dryer mid-day at their beck and call.  I want to nip this in the bud where I continue using my dryer at will (not at night while people sleep, but mid day) and they stop texting me.

4,1ejga1k,AITA for telling my mom I won't take care of grandma when she comes over for the holidays? ,"Right so, I(27F) live with my mom ATM. I'm working on moving out until the end of the year but some stuff has thrown a wench into my plans and it probably was pushed a bit further down the line. 
I do share a few bills with her and sometimes we split, sometimes I pay, etc.

I've a full time job also.

Anyways, a year ago my grandma 80+F came to spend the holidays with us, mostly Christmas but it was basically Christmas and new years. It was super exhausting for me because my mom (62F) basically left me to do every single thing.

I had to be changing her soiled diapers, I had to be spending full time with her, I had to help feed her, take her to the bathroom, towel her when she was done, clean her up when needed, take her places, etc.

And honestly I just felt so grossed out. The ONLY thing my mom would help with is cleaning the sheets and she'd do that while complaining loudly that ""I could do it because it was so easy.""

Now, I don't mind spending time with my grandma, I just think it's unfair that I have to become a full time carer for her when she travels over. (I've visited her and her house is adapted so she doesn't need help, but our apartment obviously isn't.)

We also have dogs that I have to care for full time because my mom refuses to acknowledge them.

Today we got into an argument because I said that if grandma spends the holidays with us this year that I shouldn't be the one caring for her full time. My mom called me selfish, claiming ""it's my house too! I can invite whoever I want!"", saying ""fine! So when your friends are over I won't cook or do shit for them!"" (She didn't even cook for my friends, I did everything but ok), and saying that ""it's your grandmother, show some respect!""

Anyway. AITA for setting this boundary?

EDIT: clearing some stuff I found brought up in the comments! 
-Grandma doesn't have a caregiver, but she does have a lady who goes over to her house thrice a week for company, basic care, etc!

- grandma doesn't live alone, she lives with one of my aunts and my cousin. Me and my mom have lived with her as well at some point for most of my life, anyway

-im not saying I find gross to spend time with her, or find her gross. I find gross to clean the diapers, beds, soiled stuff, bathroom stuff. 

EDIT 2 (and probably the last one)

Last I had a long conversation with my mom where I was very firm on my side. I did give her suggestions that I've seen in the comments such as the temporary doggy daycare, or hiring an extra hand, stuff like that. She was very, very against it at first, kept trying to escalate the discussion and I let it stew until this morning. During breakfast she brought the subject up again, and said we could look into hiring someone, after all. She saw I wasn't budging and that she'd be the one doing the work.

Also, yes, I want to speed my move before the end of the year.

5,1ejg7ad,AITA for only doing activities as a family?,"I'm 41m and my wife (Lily) is 41f. I have a daughter from my previous marriage (Josie, 13f) and my wife has 3 kids: (Riley, 8f; Daniel, 6m; Jake, 4m.) We married about a year ago and since then I've made huge efforts to include my stepkids in everything and trying to integrate us into our own family. Josie's mom is very active in her life but Lily's ex husband only has visitation and even then doesn't see them that often so her kids spend most their time here. Thus, I've been including them in a lot of things since they need a better father figure in their life.

Before Lily and I got married I spent a lot of one-on-one time with Josie. We'd do a lot of father-daughter activities together but once Lily and I got married I decided to integrate my stepkids into these activities so they wouldn't be deprived of any precious father-child time. I either take all kids somewhere or I do a day with just the girls and a separate day with just the boys. My daughter never said anything but it seemed like she wasn't entirely happy with this arrangement, which I chalked up to her just not being used to sharing her dad with new kids.  
(Quick explanation for why I waited until we were married: I didn't want to do all these things with my stepkids until it was official that we weren't going to break up. I still treated them as mine of course but I didn't want to build super strong parental bonds with them until I knew it was unlikely we'd end up splitting up. Also, their father was more involved until we got married, and I guess once we were married he decided to punish my wife for it by not being there for his kids as much so I stepped up.)

Josie came to me and asked if we could have our own father-daughter time like we used to. I said no because it's not fair to exclude her stepsiblings and that they're just as much family as she is. I mentioned how it'd seem like I favored her for being biologically mine if I went out with just her. She's more quiet around me and tries to stay to herself when we do things now. I guess Riley found out and she said that she would understand if I spent my own time with Josie which makes me feel bad since she's probably just saying that because she feels obligated tofor Josie's sake.

6,1ejg3f2,AITAH for asking a random girl to sleep with my friend?,"Hii, bare with me on this one.

So I(22F), my partner and six other friends are vacationing around Europe right now. One of our friends, let's say Eren, is still a virgin (22M). I don't care about it, lol, but he is very frustrated regarding this matter. 

So two days ago we were in Budapest clubbing in our hostel when this girl approaches me and my boyfriend and two other friends. She introduces herself (solo traveler), and we invite her to stay with us. Eren is somewhere else. During the night she points at one of my friends, who's in q relationship, and asks whether he s taken or not. I tell her he is and she goes ""I'm not even going to bother, I only like having sex with inexperienced guys"". This girl is physically pretty and fun to be around so I point out Eren and tell her she should hit him up in those case.

We left this morning and two hours ago Eren came humming at me. Apparently he and this girl slept together and texted over the day and she said something along the lines ""glad x told me your a greenie;))""

He is very very mad at me for talking about his private life with strangers (which I swear I did not indent to do), and for making someone to ""pity him"" to have sex.

My boyfriend sides with me (not the most objective source), and so does another of my girl friends, but the rest of the group is being neutral/defensive and kind of ignore me.

AITAH? 

Edit: Thank you for your insight. I do understand where I was wrong and hopefully I will be able to fix this with Eren. That begin said, to bring some more clarification, he never said that he wants to save himself for someone important, wants a meaningfully connection etc. I obviously don't know what happened between them and what she said, but in the morning he stated that he ""finally kicked the ball inside the net"" (it sounds weird translated, lol, but it's a local saying) with a pretty girl. Didn't sound attach or anything, but I wouldn't really know, obviously 

Edit 2: The reason I did not go to Eren in the first place (I'm not saying it's a good reason, but that was what I thought atp) is that he is not peroxide social and has a hard time talking to both men and women. He is shy and I don't think he would have made the first move.

I found out when Eva’s friend reached out to me, and Eva didn’t seem to see anything wrong with her relationship. Our relationship was strained as I didn’t approve of her relationship with Alex, and our parents turned a blind eye to Alex.

She was devastated when he broke up with her about a year later and we mended our relationship. Since then Eva has seen a few other guys, but all of her relationships agave been toxic or abusive and she’s pledged to learn from her mistakes each time.

Last week she told me she had met someone and she wanted me and my wife to meet her new boyfriend. She said this guy was different and responsible- he had a son that went to school with my daughter and they went when she picked up my daughter from school.

My wife was happy for her but I was sceptical. When she told me who he was, I asked some of the other dads, who told me that he has a son at the school, but also two sons from an ex who he doesn’t see or pay child support for.

11,1ejex9z,AITA for Refusing to Share My Friend's Number After My Sister's Argument?,"Earlier today, my sister (18F) and our mutual friend (18F) had a very heated argument which caused my sister to leave entirely and go home. It had been a long day, which was spent for the most part walking, which meant by the evening we were all exhausted and irritable.

As a result, tensions were fairly high which resulted in a fight. I’m not entirely sure of the details because when things started getting heated, I went to look for a place to stop for food. By the time I got back, my sister had stormed off and taken a bus home. I found out soon after they'd been arguing about how much their friendship meant to each other and how they had been increasingly ignoring one another as the day progressed. Other than this, I know no other details of the argument.

Later that evening, my cousin (15M) messaged me, accusing me of ditching my sister ""once again"" because I stayed for an hour longer with our mutual friend and her boyfriend. Before I did so, I spoke to my sister to make sure everything was okay on her end. But for context, a similar situation that caused rifts in my sister and our mutual friend's friendship has become an issue in the past. Just like today, I chose to stay out of the conflict, and nothing changes in either friendship with me. The hour I stayed was spent finishing the activities we had started. 

My cousin asked for my friend's number to get her side of the story and to help resolve things between the two as a way of being a good cousin. My sister had already blocked and deleted our mutual friend's number, and apparently, they are no longer friends (I had this confirmed by the mutual friend). I’m the only one who still has her number, which is why she contacted me in the first place. I refused to give the number to my cousin. I told her it would only make things worse and escalate the situation. I suggested that both of us stay out of it since it’s not really our business and, if necessary, we could intervene later after everyone had cooled down. 

I checked in with both my sister and my friend to make sure they were both okay. I had a longer conversation with my friend to reassure her that our relationship wasn’t affected and to arrange a date to pick up some belongings. 

My cousin is now furious, accusing me of taking our friend's side and says she doesn't consider me family anymore because I'm not putting my sister first. My sister did not, and still has not expressed any clear signs of disapproval or anger of me staying.

12,1ejes6z,AITA for not accepting my husband's new obsession with anime?,"When my (24F) husband (25M) and I first started dating, we went through all the normal discussions of our likes and dislikes. One of my strongest aversions has always been anime for a variety of reasons, which I made VERY clear. Obviously it's a subjective take that not everyone agrees with, but happily for me, my now-husband agreed and said he hated it too.

About a year into our engagement, I found him watching an anime (Attack on Titan). I was taken aback but he said one of his best friends insisted he watch it and it ""wasn't one of the bad ones."" I watched with him and agreed it wasn’t so bad. But a couple weeks later, I found him watching another (Berserk). Again he said his friend recommended it and it wasn’t cringy. I tried watching but tapped out and begged him to make that the last anime he watched. He assured me he wouldn't go any further.

Fast forward a couple weeks and he had not only started watching two more animes that he admitted were ""a little cringy,"" but also had a self-proclaimed obsession with Berserk, spent hundreds of dollars on Berserk books, and said he was getting a Berserk tattoo. I shut down the tattoo on the grounds that I did not want a permanent anime reference on his body that I would have to look at every day. He called me unreasonable, saying that I had no reason to hate anime so much. I replied that whether or not it seemed reasonable to him now didn't matter because I made it clear how I felt from our first day together and he's the one who started watching it despite that.

We're married now and he just keeps sinking more and more into anime. He starts a new show every few weeks, each one cringier than the last (which he admits), and all he wants to do is watch them. A big part of us spending time together after work used to be hanging out and watching shows or movies, but now he'll hole up watching anime until bed even when I tell him I'd like to watch something together. Every now and then it really sets me over the edge and the argument starts again, with him saying ""there's no reason for you to hate it so much"" and me responding ""reasonable to you or not doesn't matter because I made my feelings clear before you decided to get into it."" All we do is go in circles.

From my perspective, it was extremely disrespectful for him to make this a hobby when he knew perfectly well how strongly I hated it; and it’s even worse that he sticks to it despite the friction it's causing in our relationship.

He's a nice guy but we don't have too many interests. He told me I can bring my girlfriend. At that party I knew about 3 out of the 40 people there. 

At the party my girlfriend began complaining to me about the food options saying they don't follow her diet, she can't eat them, the host should have gotten better food, the paintings on the wall are tacky, his furniture sucks, that the music is pretty lame and a bunch of other ridiculous complaints.  We live in São Paulo at the moment but we're from a region in Southern Brazil where most people speak Hunsrik, which is a type of German, though its a bit distinct from standard German, someone from Germany wouldn't understand everything I say.

 She complained in Hunsrik, assuming that everyone at the party only knew Portuguese but my coworker was near us and he said what I guess is standard German ""I'm sorry we don't have any food that fits your dietary restrictions, if you are hungry there is a store about 400 meters from here, it closes in an hour. I'm sorry you don't appreciate the music selection would you like to play something?"" 

My girlfriend looked shock, her jaw dropped and she just stuttered for a bit, a few people snicker in the back and another guy translates what happened and she responded back in Portuguese ""how do you all know German?

She demanded i give her the car keys and I refused. 

We stayed at the party for another 2-3 hours, she talked to some other girls but was kind of quiet. On the ride home we got into another argument where she says I should have taken her side and I unleashed a lot of my frustration onto her saying she is actually the one causing embarassment by insulting my coworker.

Two weeks ago we all had a dinner together and my oldest brother brought his girlfriend. While I was doing something, he went upstairs to my bathroom and used my MANSCAPE to trim his beard without asking… I use it to trim my Nuts and A** hairs. So I went up and he left hair on the sink and the lights on so I knew it was him. I didn’t want to embarrass him while his girlfriend was there so I decided not to bring it up while she was there. Weeks go by, today he came by before going to see his girlfriend. He said he needed to go to the bathroom, instead of using the one next to him he goes upstairs. I knew what he was doing so I went outside the door quietly recording a video so I could have proof of hearing the trimmer knowing that he would lie when I confront him.

5 minutes go by and I ask him about it, He lies… I mention the video OF JUST THE SOUND and he calls me a freak for “sneaking around” and an idiot because he knew I caught him. My parents say nothing as he keeps disrespecting me, calling me things, and continuing to play victim. We’re both persistent, me because he won’t own up to it, and him because he knew I caught him. 

He gets closer to me, I back away, he keeps putting his hands, I back away more. Long story short - we get into it, he calls me the bad guy(playing victim, how original smh) and my parents still don’t want to take my side.

15,1eje6kj,WIBTA for not showing up for my friends big events when she couldn't bother showing up to mine?,"I (28 F) have a friend that I will call Lindsey (30 F). We met at work around 8 years ago and we have been very close until recently. We are in a friend group with some of our other coworkers (we all work at a spa and hair salon). 

Lindsey has always struggled with feeling like she is behind in life. However in the recent years it has gotten worse. She had a long term boyfriend for about 4 years (when she was 20-24)  that she planned on marrying. However about 6 months before my wedding they broke up. She was obviously very heartbroken, so I understood when she stepped down from the MOH position, however she ended up fully pulling out of my wedding, and all of our mutual friend's weddings or wedding events. She skipped all the bachelorettes, bridal showers, or any wedding themed activities for many years.

It was hard for all of us because she was a good friend, and we wanted her to be at these events. She ended up meeting an amazing guy when she was 27, and her mental health improved. However they have struggled with infertility.

This year me and my husband found out we were pregnant which was a complete surprise and very scary. My husband's job was bought out by a bigger company and he lost his job, so we had to downsize to a one bedroom apartment until he ended up finding a new job. It was really scary and I was hoping to lean on my close friends, like Lindsey. 

Because of her struggle with infertility she did not support us at all. After we told her we were pregnant she completely shut down. She skipped the baby shower, gender reveal (all which were very small and only close friends and family. She also didn't come to the hospital to meet our baby girl and did not end up wanting to meet her until 8 months after she was born, when she found out she was pregnant. 

Now that she is pregnant suddenly she is so excited for all these big events she is planning. They have decided to get married before the baby comes, and I have received invitations for the wedding, baby shower, gender reveal, and she asked me to be one of her brides maids. 

Now personally ever since she refused to be part of my babies life, and therefore my life, I have considered her to just be a coworker.

So would I be the asshole if I chose to not come to these big upcoming events.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-03,"WIBTA for not showing up for my friends big events when she couldn't bother showing up to mine? I (28 F) have a friend that I will call Lindsey (30 F). We met at work around 8 years ago and we have been very close until recently. We are in a friend group with some of our other coworkers (we all work at a spa and hair salon). 

Lindsey has always struggled with feeling like she is behind in life. However in the recent years it has gotten worse. She had a long term boyfriend for about 4 years (when she was 20-24)  that she planned on marrying. However about 6 months before my wedding they broke up. She was obviously very heartbroken, so I understood when she stepped down from the MOH position, however she ended up fully pulling out of my wedding, and all of our mutual friend's weddings or wedding events. She skipped all the bachelorettes, bridal showers, or any wedding themed activities for many years.

It was hard for all of us because she was a good friend, and we wanted her to be at these events. She ended up meeting an amazing guy when she was 27, and her mental health improved. However they have struggled with infertility.

This year me and my husband found out we were pregnant which was a complete surprise and very scary. My husband's job was bought out by a bigger company and he lost his job, so we had to downsize to a one bedroom apartment until he ended up finding a new job. It was really scary and I was hoping to lean on my close friends, like Lindsey. 

Because of her struggle with infertility she did not support us at all. After we told her we were pregnant she completely shut down. She skipped the baby shower, gender reveal (all which were very small and only close friends and family. She also didn't come to the hospital to meet our baby girl and did not end up wanting to meet her until 8 months after she was born, when she found out she was pregnant. 

Now that she is pregnant suddenly she is so excited for all these big events she is planning. They have decided to get married before the baby comes, and I have received invitations for the wedding, baby shower, gender reveal, and she asked me to be one of her brides maids. 

Now personally ever since she refused to be part of my babies life, and therefore my life, I have considered her to just be a coworker.

16,1ejdqli,AITA for using my phone in class?,"
I have this teacher for my senior year of hs and theres a no phone rule of course but was never stated in her class although knowing this I decided to check my phone cause it was vibrating like crazy and I didn't want it to disrupt the class incase of a phonecall you could say that I was going to out it on silent and even check messages for any emergencies cause this didn't happen often for me, that class at the time wasn't even half way through the period and we were only doing group presentations. No recitation no note taking involving the presentation it was a very ""listen if you want to"" type of class so as I was taking out my phone I really did try to hide it ,I wasn't waving it around and even having it directly in my face just on my lap.

(So here's the thing due to hearing disabilities I was also wearing discreet noise cancelling earbuds that doubled as headphones so at the time I was listening to music but I could still hear and understand what everyone was saying okay so also listening to said presentations. After surrendering my phone the prof decided to watch me from behind the entirety of the lesson )

 I didn't notice my prof getting near me from behind and so she saw my phone on me with the messaging app open. She asked for my phone and of course that was reasonable enough and gave it without hesitation. 
The only reason I noticed my teacher there was  when my music suddenly stopping mid song and I turn around and see her, actively trying to unlock my phone password guessing and all every trying to reset it. I was so uncomfortable for the rest of the period more so weirded out and thankful I had a password,so this teacher really would go to the full extent of going through a student's phone if possible without any valid reason? Is that not illegal without warrant or yea valid reasons like harm against yourself or others?

Couldn't be let off without punishment but man it was less than a week into school and I got into the faculty rumors already an OFFENCE on my record ,got told to clean our room and have a walk of shame to ask for my phone at the faculty 2 floors up, when I got there and told her I cleaned up like she asked I got dismissed and said she didn't believe me so I had to go back down and convince one of the people I cleaned with to go BACK with me to faculty to talk to that teacher and with no choice and constantly making snarly degrading  remarks she had to hand over my phone. As I was walking away I heard her laughing sarcasticly and that pissed me off even more. Wanting confront her on her problem wasn't the best option in mind so I continued on am I the aita ?

17,1ejdczb,AITA for telling my cousin how bad his brother is? ,"This might be a bit long, idk yet. For reference I am a 18W, my baby cousin 6M, and his older brother 17M. 

When I was in 5th grade I moved to my aunt and uncles house due to some parental issues my dad had. It was my aunt, uncle, me, my older cousin (Dave), his brother (Lee), my brother (Gage), and the youngest cousin (Eddie). (All names changed for privacy). Soon after Eddie was born my grandma (Deede) moved in as well after my aunt got sick. During this time the only people who took care of Eddie was my grandmother and I. Soon after my aunt passed and our household went through several changes such as moving and some of the kids being separated. Currently it is now only my grandma, Eddie, and I. 

Lee ended up living with his biological dad, my uncle went to jail for his relapse. So then it was Dave, Gage, Eddie, Deede, and I.

The reason the other two boys left was because Dave ended up becoming a super unruly child and getting arrested for juvie and ended convincing my brother to follow in his path. Dave is now in foster care after many intolerable things he had done to my family, Gage (my brother) is just in a type of facility to help learn and improve himself as he is not much of treat as Dave was.

Anyways as I said, there’s only three of us now, My grandma, Eddie, and I. Eddie is a very loving child and I love him so much as he is my own child. We even look a like and it’s a fun game to see how many people think I am a young mother. Well Eddie sometime misses his older brother Dave and it makes me so angry that he still finds good in Dave.

I wish I could explain how horrible Dave is, not just to me but to my ENTIRE family, and sadly including Eddie. 

I try to tell Eddie all the horrible things Dave did to him but Eddie is still young and was even younger when it happened so he doesn’t remember much. I just don’t want Eddie to get hurt again if Dave ever contacts or sees him again. However, I know from experience it is up to the person whether they want to forgive the person who betrayed them as I have with my parents. 

It’s different because I want him to be safe and happy and I feel in my heart, body, and soul that Eddie would just get hurt again and I don’t want that for him. Just thinking about it hurts me, but I don’t want him to ever resent me for holding him from having that decision himself.

I [23m] just moved into my first apartment on my own. I've only lived here for five months. It's a one bedroom shoe box but it's mine. And the best part is that it allows pets. I'm planning to get a dog very soon. My family has had dogs all my life. The problem I'm having is with my girlfriend [21f]. She doesn't live with me, but she's over a lot. When I told her I wanted to get a dog she was excited, until I mentioned I wanted a dachshund. 

I love dachshunds. I grew up with a little brown weiner dog named Teddy. We had a couple other dogs at the same time, but Teddy and I were bonded. He was a really sweet, gentle, and well trained dog. I loved him so much. As a kid he would jump up and snuggle into my bed during storms and I loved it because I was really scared of big storms back then. He was my best friend until he passed. I've always wanted to get another dachshund. My girlfriend however, doesn't like small dogs. I didn't know this until I mentioned what breed I'm planning to get and she flipped out. She says she can't stand tiny dogs because they jump and bark and are just really irritating to her. She loves big dogs, but apparently small ones are all demons to her. I told her I would train the dog and make sure it was well behaved. This isn't my first time having one, but she insists that small dogs can't be trained and she won't want to spend time with me if I have one around. Now she's giving me the silent treatment because I'm not backing down and still want a dachshund. 

My parents are on my side because they loved Teddy too and are excited for me to get another dachshund. My dad even offered to help dog proof My apartment and help train the dog, since he was the one that originally trained Teddy. My friends are kind of split. Since she doesn't actually live with me, some are saying her opinion doesn't matter on what dog I get, but some think that I should compromise and find another breed that we both would like so she feels more comfortable, but that doesn't feel fair to me. I've been looking forward to this for so long and I just don't understand why she's being so weird about it. She won't tell me specifically why she hates small dogs, she just does and that's it.

19,1ejd80i,AITA for nicknaming the “family” dog. ,"Back in May my little sister turned 10, she got a chihuahua for her birthday. This was a very very big deal and she promised the sun, sky and the stars she’d do everything for it. As we all know and were prepared for she did not. Oh well life goes on and puppy who was named Boba after the tea has become more of a family dog. 

I live next door.  3 years ago my childhood dog and our family dog passed, we had lots of nicknames for her: bear, seal, baby dog, cheesle, honey bear, Rosie bear, the list is never ending but this was a family thing okay. 

We got Lulu in 2022! Border collie X she’s a good girl and she also got some random funny nicknames. I call her Louie, loubear. My mum calls her…. Potonski. Which evolved from Louis Vuitton. 

Regardless as we can see this has never been an issue.

Boba just doesn’t have a ring to it for me, it’s my first time having love for a boy dog. My boy cats name is shade (he permanently goes by The Shane because it’s hilarious) 

I just have been calling him bobbie and bob or little bob or the bobster. My family will correct me to say Boabster, boabie, boab, boabs, or little boabs. I seriously think this sounds like boobs. I haven’t said this because I don’t want to be rude. Regardless I think Bob is hilarious, he is tiny and a tiny man. If someone is around I will use his government name, or if it’s training I will obviously or on a walk etc. 

I keep getting told not to say Bobbie at all and last night he came up to me during a movie and I greeted him, I was once again told off by my mum which I up until now have assumed is a joke. I said “you have the worlds weirdest names for Lulu, you call her patronks and tavosnkee? I can’t call him bob?” She snapped back “Well he isn’t your dog is he? So get over it and call him his name” 

This morning I went back over to ask about it because it felt very uncomfortable and I was told im being rude in their house by disrespecting their boundaries 

I told them I didn’t realise they were that serious, im not trying to rename their dog whatsoever and just entertaining myself quietly with how he’s just a little guy. 

They told me boabs is his nickname and I have to use it. I ended up just laughing at them and having to leave while being told I am immature and rude.

I live in a state where it's pretty difficult to acquire a license without having previous drivers ed experience. I was going to take drivers ed at 16 but due to covid restrictions, my school wouldn't allow me to take the course. I decided to wait until I was 18 instead. I wasn't able to sign up for my permit until I was 19 because life got in the way.

My sister (F26) has been my guardian since I was 15, she raised me throughout High School. She has been teaching me how to drive, she helped my buy my first car etc. We still live together and we're about to move into our new apartment in a month. Our new apartment is halfway across the country and I absolutely need my drivers license in order to start working, paying rent, etc.

I passed my written exam, got my permit, did my hours and then sent in my driving log. My road test is in 2 weeks. I haven't had a lot of time to practice driving (It's been a couple of months but it's nobody's fault nor my own, we can both agree on that). So she is having me practice a ton. But this is where I'm frustrated. Instead of letting me practice things like parallel parking or back in parking in a low traffic area, she is having me do these things on the spot in very high traffic areas.

I personally think she is pushing me too fast.

Tonight, she wants me to parallel park on the busiest side of town without practicing beforehand. We both understand that I need to pass this test (or else I'll have to redo the entire process again in a different state), but I'm terrified to parallel park on a busy street (during rush hour!!) without practice.

When I ask her if we can take things slower, because I'm not ready yet, she tells me to suck it up and that I'll ""Sink or Swim"". I'm not saying I won't do it, just that I'd like a little practice first? If she let me practice a little bit before we go, I wouldn't mind doing it tonight. But she refuses.

22,1ejb0bf,AITA for corresponding with and accepting money from my abusive ex’s mom?,"
*TW Abuse* 
I (35F) dated a guy (35M - let’s call him John) for a few years. He was amazing in the beginning. He made me feel loved and cherished. He popped the question about a month in. Now, I see it was complete love bombing and manipulation. John said he noticed me for years and had been waiting for his chance. John started off with emotional abuse, then it escalated to physical abuse. I never saw it coming because he is close with his exes and I got to know him and they all sang his praises. So I thought maybe I brought it out of him and blamed myself. He’d abuse me, then feel remorse and shower me in love and gifts, things would be ok, then he’d do it all over again. Eventually, I caught him cheating. I began planning my escape. I moved and didn’t tell him where to. I stopped sharing my location with him. It drove him crazy. I began communicating less. Pulling away slowly until I finally escaped. By then, he already found someone knew he was seeing behind my back, so he didn’t freak out like he did every other time I tried to get away. Initially, John disappeared, then came back wanting to be friends. I missed the person he once was, so I gave in, then when he lied to me about having a gf and tried to rekindle our relationship, I went NC. 6 months before we split, I got to meet his mom and we hit it off. I’ll call her Betty. I have a very awful relationship with my mom, as she is very emotionally abusive. Betty is everything my mom isn’t. She’s kind and caring, and treats me like the daughter she never had. So I kept in contact with her after she continued reaching out and apologized for her son’s behavior. 

Fast forward a couple years. I’m with a wonderful man (35 M, let’s call him Chris). Chris and I are expecting our first child. Meanwhile, I still keep in regular contact with Betty. Betty sends me good morning messages, she always asks how I am, she tells me she loves and misses me, and she occasionally sends me money. She says it’s because I foot the bill for her son for so long and because of how he treated me. My friends are about 50/50 on this. Half think it’s sweet and that I basically have a mom in my life and she has a daughter since her and her son don’t have the best relationship. The other half think it’s weird. My partner and I have agreed that I won’t give her personal info - like where we live (she’s asked for my address before) and not specifically where I work. I haven’t told her I’m pregnant either. Today, she sent me money after her normal good morning messages. It’s been about a month since I heard from her. I told my partner and he got kind of put off by it for the first time. He said he felt it was weird and honestly thought the correspondence would fizzle out. He asked that I not disclose that I’m pregnant for safety reasons. I asked another friend (who knew my ex and was previously supportive of my friendship with his mom) and she told me she now thinks it’s weird. On one hand, I feel like I have the kind of relationship with Betty that I always wanted with my own mom that’s loving and supportive and dont want to hurt her by cutting it off. The money she has sent me has been so helpful because her son destroyed my car and many other things, so I’m recouping those losses. On the other hand, I feel like I need to respect my partner’s feelings on it, and there is still that real fear from PTSD that her son will find out/find me through her. ",TL;DR,2024-08-03,"AITA for corresponding with and accepting money from my abusive ex’s mom? 
*TW Abuse* 
I (35F) dated a guy (35M - let’s call him John) for a few years. He was amazing in the beginning. He made me feel loved and cherished. He popped the question about a month in. Now, I see it was complete love bombing and manipulation. John said he noticed me for years and had been waiting for his chance. John started off with emotional abuse, then it escalated to physical abuse. I never saw it coming because he is close with his exes and I got to know him and they all sang his praises. So I thought maybe I brought it out of him and blamed myself. He’d abuse me, then feel remorse and shower me in love and gifts, things would be ok, then he’d do it all over again.

23,1ejauwg,AITA for not refunding friend for an air bnb. They cancelled their part of the trip.,"
Long story short a group of 6 of my friends and I all made a plan to go to Chicago in September for a week. Our plan was to obviously explore around Chicago and head to a concert one of the days we were there.. 
Now, I (23f) invited my best friend (24f) to join us and she was more than welcome to bring her boyfriend along as my bf is also coming with us. Both of them agreed and we even cancelled our original air bnb reservation to a bigger space so they could have their own room as well. Basically we finally included them in our budget plan as well because they agreed to come and even paid for their side of expenses. 
Yesterday she texted our group saying “we aren’t going to go through with going to Chicago because we got tickets for a trip to LA and going to Chicago would have us over spending” Okay cool, then she goes to say “We didn’t think we’d get the tickets until we saw the charge in our bank account. LMAAOO.”  What? Okay. Well now that sucks because now we have to figure out as a group what to do next because like I said they were included in our budget. 
Anyway, aita for feeling upset over this and not wanting to refund them for this trip? Really itd just be the air bnb. We’ll have to pay more now that they’re not going and cancelled a trip they committed to for another trip they decided on a whim.

24,1ejarwl,AITA for not immediately telling my friend what our friend said about her ,"At work I (29) had a group of friends, we were all very loyal to each other and cared about each others feelings.

I went out with 2 friends I used to work with and C who I still work with but not really friends outside of chatting at work sometimes. Me and C weren't drinking as we were driving but the 2 other girls were. C mentioned something about my good friend at work, B, that she had bad b.o, and one of the girls agreed, both said it in a nasty way. I was shocked as I had never noticed it before, and very annoyed that they were saying nasty things about her at all, especially to me since they knew I was goid friends with her. As one of the girls later reminded me I was very defensive for B and kept defending her, then I was talking with the other girl about how I felt so bad for B because she has such bad body image already, and how she shouldn't because she is very pretty and nice personality.

I felt I needed to tell her as I would want to know if that's something people were saying about me, especially if it's something that can be easily fixed.

When I went to work on Monday, I saw myself and B's friend E (B's best friend at work) and said to her about what happened, my main concern being worried about how B would react as I was worried she would spiral about her appearance. We both wondered how to say it to B in the nicest and most helpful way. I suggested bring her to dinner and saying in a gentle way what C said and that we're telling her because it's something I would want to know, and I've had problems with sweating alot so I know good deodorant to use.

I saw E again on Wednesday and we talked about it again, she said her mom suggested we don't say it to her because we never noticed a B.O problem with her. I said that since I knew about it I know I can't not tell her. Then E said something about saying to B that C was talking bad behind B's back, I thought that was already a given seeing as how I said about telling B what C said already, it wasn't my main concern, how B would react and feel was.

I was off work the next day, then on Friday me and B had the same shift at work, we had lunch together and I felt like she was in a good mindset and I was going to say to her what C had said (in a kind way obviously), the only reason I didn't was because I felt because I had involved E I should wait to say it with her or at least consult her.

I went home from work and saw on instagram that B and E were at dinner. Then B left the group chat saying she was sure we'd find out why soon. I sent her a ? and she said E told her what C said and that I was 'basically trying to protect him' and how she's done with me. E never spoke to me since then so I don't know how she came to that conclusion. I never wasn't going to tell B that C said that, I was never close to him and only sometimes talked to him at work.

After his death, all of my paternal side of the family started to talk about disturbing the family inheritance, and most of that was what my father had earned and made in his life time and not that of my paternal grandparents who also had died long ago, in short after my dads death all of my paternal uncles and cousins took mostly anything and everything from us all that was left to us was out family home which my dad had bought when he married my mother. And before you say why didn't we take any legal action, the justice system here is usually at best and only if you have money and can bribe people, you don't matter if you're poor, so we did have any means to fight them and. my mom suffered an accident in 2015 which fractured both of her femurs and they never recovered even after countless failed surgeries and procedures so now she's in a wheelchair, and at the time of the inheritance talk my family would mostly come to threaten us.

27,1ejakmm,AITA for going to a concert instead of a family wedding?,"
I (16F) am going to a concert next month with my cousin, B (19M). Him and my aunt are coming here (California) from Toronto so we can go to the concert together and do some other stuff. My cousin on the other side of the family (M) is also getting married the same weekend. M told us that he was getting married sometime in September about a year ago but didn’t tell us the exact dates until last month. I don’t know why. 

My mom asked if I could not go to the concert and ask B to get tickets in his city and go there instead. I said no and that I wasn’t gonna go to the wedding. In our culture, there’s some stuff that the groom’s sister does at the wedding and my mom said M wanted me to do all that since he doesn’t have a sister. I still said no. I haven’t seen B in person since I was 2 and we’ve also bought Disneyland and Universal tickets after the concert and booked a hotel room. We’re gonna lose a lot of money if we cancel this and I really want to see him. 

M lives two hours away from me but we’ve never had a super close relationship since I’m way younger than all my cousins on my dad’s side but me and B are really close even though we haven’t met in 14 years. My mom is really mad at me about this. She thinks I should prioritize M’s wedding. She also never really wanted me to go to this concert in the first place but agreed to let me go because my aunt is going too. 

She keeps being passive aggressive about this and is saying I don’t care about my family. I think she’s being ridiculous. I’m skipping my dad’s nephew’s wedding to hang out with her nephew. I don’t know why she’s getting so worked up about this when my dad doesn’t even care. She’s still mad at me and isn’t talking to me at all unless she has to and she’s been telling her friends that I’m being disrespectful and alienating my family. AITA?

So I went home after work, rearranged my entire night to see him, microwaved a quick meal instead of eating something good so I could see him, showered instead of exercising, etc. When it got later, I tried to call him twice. He wouldn't answer, but he did text back that it wasn't going to happen that night. I tried to call again and he wouldn't answer.

So I got upset and started texted him things like, ""You always bail when you make plans in advance,"" ""I rearranged my entire night for you,"" ""I could've ate a better dinner,"" ""I put on this outfit for nothing,"" ""Now I can't exercise tonight, because I already showered to come see you,"" etc. I was getting more and more worked up because he was ignoring me the rest of the night.

35,1ej8yde,AITA for writing a letter about how my mind works and being truthful with my parents?,"I (22f) have been diagnosed as autistic/ADHD since I was 18. I should clarify I have been off of my meds for a few months due to an ongoing issue with insurance making it too expensive to afford my meds, and a recent stint of unemployment.

I was let go from a job early March due to my height (I am 5'2"") making it hard for me to give the same output as my coworkers. Job searching was hell, and it took me a while to find something that would work, and the unemployment checks weren't a lot of money because my former job wasn't high paying.

I found a job after 3mos, but I was having a hard time paying my bills during that time. I pay rent, a small amount for insurance, and a car payment to my parents. I also pay for my own phone and any other necessities or subscriptions I use (Spotify, which I pay for for the whole family). My parents were generous enough to waive my rent, insurance, and car payments while I was looking for a job.

However, it was brought to my attention only **AFTER** I got a new job that they were disappointed with me for not ""doing more around the house while I was home"" (I did my regular chores but was hyper focused on job searching most of the time, so I didn't do anything extra bc I didn't have the mental capacity to focus on much else). They told me they ""understood that my brain processes differently"" but really thought that I should have been able to read ""between the lines"" and realize that was what they expected of me. And they told me they ""wouldn't have asked for me to pay back those three months"" if I had done so.

This made me realize we were really disconnected in terms of communicating our thought processes, so I decided to sit down and write out a letter that broke down how my thought process works in a way I thought everyone might understand. I agonized over it for a month, making sure to keep it general and informative, and making sure no one could take it personally.

I read it to my parents about a week ago, and they asked me questions about it, and I answered each one of them truthfully. I never mentioned in any way how they may have affected the way I am during my childhood or anything of that kind - simply answered questions that someone could get similar answers for online if they were to look it up, and told them about several helpful resources if they thought I wasn't good enough at explaining it.

But now my parents are refusing to directly talk to/acknowledge me in any capacity (even going so far as to do things with my siblings and not invite me with them or tell me about them), and my siblings are telling me that they're ""mad that I'm blaming them"" and that they think I should have just kept my mouth shut.

36,1ej8tih,AITA for excluding the gf of a friendgroup-breaking relationship from hangouts?,"(Names have been changed.)

For background information, the former friend group consisted of five people. Two men and three women. We got along fairly well until the end of last year when Jason (M20) and Lily (F22) started dating 3 or so months into the friendship. The signs were there, so it wasn't all that unexpected. Lily was the same nationality as all of Jason's previous partners, and Lily stayed behind to help him clean (his place was the usual hangout grounds). We congratulated them and Jason expressed that he “didn’t want to ruin our friendship” by dating in the friend group. Cool, right?

Well, I (F20) noticed very quickly that Jason was becoming less active in the chat, not reading messages for days, sometimes weeks on end. The chat gradually died, Andrew (M23) creating a separate chatroom for the remaining three after being frustrated by his disregard. The three girls’ chat consisting of myself, Lily, and Tiana (F20) died off as well.  A few months passed without news from Jason.

Fast forward to 2 months ago: Jason has contacted me and Tiana in a separate group chat, explaining that his ghosting session lasting for months was because he felt uncomfortable interacting with Andrew. He would not elaborate on what was wrong, claiming that he would talk with Andrew when the time was right. Apparently his reasoning for ghosting myself and Tiana as part of the package was so that he “wasn’t forcing us two to pick sides.” We expressed our disappointment with his behavior and haven’t interacted with him since. Andrew expressed confusion and expressed guilt for dragging us into this situation. Apparently the uncomfortable situation happened in January and Andrew still doesn’t know what he did wrong. Jason described his dynamic with Andrew as ""toxic"" (verbatim) in a separate series of messages to him and I can't see how his behavior is any different.

Meanwhile, Lily has been trying to reconcile with the three of us, having separate sessions to explain her side of the story. She confessed about feeling stuck in the middle, and how she feels sad about the friendship going awry. She has contacted myself and Tiana so far but hasn’t interacted much with Tiana afterward. Andrew hasn't informed me of any contact from her yet. I understand but feel frustrated that she witnessed this debaucle from the side up until now, afraid of ruining the comfortable dynamic she built with her boyfriend by calling out his avoidant behavior. 

Here is the dilemma: The three remaining members of the friend group recently got together to celebrate Tiana’s birthday and Lily seems to be upset that she wasn’t included. I think there is still tension between Andrew and Lily (her being Jason’s gf) and believe it would have been very uncomfortable to have her with us.

She married someone else and at first they were doing good, and she attempted to even get custody of me while I was in 3rd grade, but failed.

Then somehow they both got addicted to pain pills, and were always doing drugs, some I can’t even remember their names. They divorced when I was around 11, and my mom never even attempted to find a job for herself or stable housing, despite having a cosmetology license.

She went to prison for 2 years while I was in high school due to drug possession near a school. I figured after she got out she would change and get her life together, but no. She always tells me she loves me and wants to provide for me and stuff, but has never even attempted to get her life together to be able to do right by her child. Often she’ll call me that she’s depressed and wants to end it all, or that I’m a terrible child because I don’t call her everyday. I work full time on top of taking multiple classes for respiratory therapy, as well as live with my boyfriend and our 2 dogs. My schedule is very full and I’ve told her she can always come by to see me and hang out, but she never does because she won’t work to save for a car. I don’t go see her because she’s always at random houses with random crackheads and I feel uncomfortable. 

We got into an argument one day because I told her I’m an adult now and I provide everything for myself, and that I don’t need her anymore in the same way that I did when I was 12 years old. She lost her shit and basically said that I’m blowing her off. When in reality she has never been there for me, any advice or help or just genuine love and care has came from my dad and his side of the family. She gets jealous when she hears that I’ve spent time with my dad and not her. 

She told me that day I better take care of her when she’s old, and I told her honestly you never took care of me, and couldn’t even be bothered to get a job to support yourself your whole life why should I support you. It may have been harsh, and I hope my mom gets the help she needs but I have tried for years to set her up with a job or connections or college and she won’t help herself.

I work full time on top of taking multiple classes for respiratory therapy, as well as live with my boyfriend and our 2 dogs. My schedule is very full and I’ve told her she can always come by to see me and hang out, but she never does because she won’t work to save for a car. I don’t go see her because she’s always at random houses with random crackheads and I feel uncomfortable. 

We got into an argument one day because I told her I’m an adult now and I provide everything for myself, and that I don’t need her anymore in the same way that I did when I was 12 years old. She lost her shit and basically said that I’m blowing her off. When in reality she has never been there for me, any advice or help or just genuine love and care has came from my dad and his side of the family. She gets jealous when she hears that I’ve spent time with my dad and not her. 

She told me that day I better take care of her when she’s old, and I told her honestly you never took care of me, and couldn’t even be bothered to get a job to support yourself your whole life why should I support you. It may have been harsh, and I hope my mom gets the help she needs but I have tried for years to set her up with a job or connections or college and she won’t help herself. I am tired of pretending to care for someone that won’t care for themselves and never took care of me. ",0.0,-0.0119994422420859,0,1
38,1ej7wmr,AITA for taking my daughter to play mini golf while my other daughter was at the doctor?,"This is my first post. The names and some of the non-relevant details are fudged for privacy.

My wife, Rose (30's/F), and I (40's/M) have two daughters, Mary (6/F) and Allie (4/F). Allie has sufffered from moderate asthma and has to see a doctor every three to six months to make sure she's okay and determine whether or not she needs to be on an inhaler.

Allie had her appointment on Thursday, and Rose took her. I was in charge of picking up Mary from camp. This is where the disagreement begins. That morning, we were talking about the afternoon plans. I swear Rose said to Mary, ""You and dad can do something fun."" Rose claims she said, ""You and did will have to figure out what to do,"" and that I said, ""Yeah, we will do something fun."" Later in the day, I texted Rose and said, ""Just wanna know [when you will be back] so I can figure out what Mary and I will do."" She didn't respond to that particular message.

I planned on doing something fun with Mary when I picked her up from camp. When I got her, it turned out she'd won an award at camp. I called Rose and Allie to share the news and we were all pumped.

Mary and I discussed and decided to go mini golf. We had about an hour to kill before we had to meet Rose and Allie for dinner.

Mary and I are about halfway through mini golf when Rose calls me with Allie in the car after the appointment. I told her we were at mini golf. She is furious with me. Allie starts whining that it isn't fair that she didn't go, to which I tell her that I am taking her next week while Mary is with some of our family for a few nights.

While the argument itself ended fine and a few hours later, Rose maintains that I was in the wrong to take Mary to mini golf. She says that it isn't fair to Allie and that it makes Allie feel as if she's been punished for having a doctor appointment. I don't agree. We are very fair and treat our kids equally. There is no favorite, no golden child. At the same time, we try to instill in them that life isn't 100% fair all the time. Even so, I planned on doing something with her this week, as I said, and there's been plenty of times Allie gets to do something while Mary can't because she has something else going on.

I don't think I did anything wrong taking Mary golfing. We had time to kill and she was celebrating her award. My wife believes I should have just taken her home and hung out there, but I didn't want to just sit at home and put on the TV or something. I wanted something a bit more fun. I do admit that I should have kept it quiet from Allie to avoid upsetting her.

39,1ej6xe1,AITA for having a social life which clashes with my mom’s?,"My mom divorced my dad when I (19) was little, and my brother cut off contact with my dad when we were in high school. I’ve had my fights with him but now we actually are in good terms and meet twice a week, and it’s always on the days were my mom isn’t in the city due to work, which I made sure of because she’s only around four days a week.

This moving around between cities started last year, so it’s new. Before that I would constantly be around her, especially during the summer because she would take me and my brother to her partner’s place, which is like a summerhouse. I never really had any friends then, maybe one or two, but I would never meet them when we were at her partners place as it is pretty far away from home. 

However this year has been different because I’ve made some friends, and along with my improved relationship with my dad, I have a pretty good but normal social life. Most weeks, I meet two friends, which combined with meeting dad makes me busy 2-3 days a week. 

I had a fight with my mom last week because I wanted to drive home to be there for two days in order to meet a friend and my dad instead of staying with her at her partner’s place. She got mad and threatened that she would stop paying the bills and stuff and that I might as well move to my dad’s place.

She then told me the same thing as in the last fight, but it was worse. She said I would’ve crawled to my dad if it was dinner with him instead of with them. I asked her if the situation would be different if I paid half (I’m a student so I can’t work full time) the bills, and she said it wasn’t about money but about integrity.

41,1ej5w37,AITAH - Took wrong food container for lunch,"I (38F) just got a very strong “talking to” from my husband (39 M) that has gone on for way too long for taking the “wrong” container of dinner from the night before for lunch yesterday. 

He demanded to review what I wrote prior to posting. His response to reading the following is “Your response is, I’m not sorry you should’ve done even more than you already did to ensure I wouldn’t waste carrots that were meant for you. Which will make YTA”.  This is so silly and embarrassing that I almost hope no one reads this. 

What happened…

The night before last, my husband made chicken and dumplings for the family. We are both trying to be better with our food consumption and are intermittent fasting. Our dinner = lunch for the next day. He wants me to be very clear that these are NOT leftovers.

Yesterday, getting ready to leave for work and packing my lunch, I sent him a text confirming the smaller container was mine. His reply was “no” and in response I told him “I don’t need that much”. The container of food he packed for me was way more than I could eat and I knew it would be wasted. His response back “you will need it” and that he was “going to eating something else for lunch”. Rushing, I take the container with less because it seemingly didn’t matter because he had other plans for lunch.

 I go to work, heat up my food and I don’t finish it all. I don’t particularly like cooked carrots and there were so many so that was what was mostly left behind. I come home yesterday evening and nothing was brought up about the container switch. 

THIS is my fault! I forgot to empty my lunch bag yesterday when I came home. This morning when he sees my lunch bag, he opens it and sees my container from the day before. He is highly upset that I didn’t finish it and that there were so many carrots left that he could have eaten. We get into an argument  about it.

 We were in the same room while he was packing them and nothing was said about him packing the lunches a specific way. I always take the lesser full container. This scenario seemed no different than any other scenario. 

How I ended up here…

He told me that I should take this to Reddit and if I do, that I would “get eaten up”.  That this is insane that I don’t understand that he shouldn’t have to waste his time to communicate with me because he cooked and packed the lunch. I should just take it. He shouldn’t have to put more effort in than he already does. 

We have always struggled with communication and I just feel that it would have been simple enough for him to just say “hey, I packed our lunches a certain way. Yours has more but mine has more carrots in it. I also wanted less bread/dumplings”. 

I am very appreciative that he cooked for the family and even offered to help prepare it. I don’t appreciate getting “talked at” like I’m a child that needs a scolding. If he talks about one more goddamn carrot, I’m serving him papers (not really). Am I really the asshole here? If I am, I have to profusely apologize to him.

44,1ej5nev,AITA for telling my aunt I won't bake a cake for my uncle's birthday after he ruined my mother's birthday celebration that I planned?,"I'm 23F, my mom (54F) has a sister (47F, ""Hailey"") and a brother (52M, ""Ian""). My mom and Ian are both very close to Hailey. Ian has a chronic illness and was cheated on by his wife of several years, they divorced about 10 years ago and he was laid off from his job around the same time. I don't know the details because I was pretty young, but my mom's relationship with him became more distant even though she tried to support him. I think he was (and is?) quite resentful of her because he was dealt a shittier hand - my mom has no real health issues, she has a lovely husband and a lovely daughter (I hope, lol), and a stable job. He's now in a better place financially and my mom has been trying to rebuild their relationship, they text often and even call a few times a month. 

For my mom's birthday this year I got plane tickets for my mom, dad, and me to go stay with Hailey's family in the city my mom grew up, so we could have some of her oldest friends over to celebrate. And I baked a cake. This was a surprise for my mom, but I asked Hailey if it was alright beforehand, and she was excited and up for it. But when we arrived I found out that Ian was also visiting, which Hailey hadn't told me. I asked her about it and she said she forgot to tell me because she didn't think it was a big deal, apparently he visits often. Ian was friendly with my mom, and she seemed happy he was there, so I thought it would be okay. I told Ian the night before my mom's bday about the party plan, and asked if he wanted to attend or had other plans. He said he was going  out with friends that morning but he would be home by evening for the party.

  
My mom's friends arrived at 5 and Ian wasn't home, I thought he'd come soon, but he wasn't home even by 10 and my mom's friends started to have to leave. I called Ian several times and so did Hailey, but he didn't pick up. My mom was really upset because she assumed he would be there, and initially when she asked I'd confirmed that he would. Eventually we did cut the cake without him, and he came home at around 12:30 after my mom's friends had all left. I didn't say anything to him. Hailey tried telling me he didn't mean to make my mom sad.I was really angry but I didn't want to cause drama and make my mom more upset. We went home the next day. 

Recently Hailey invited my me and parents to visit again to celebrate Ian's birthday. My parents are going, but I said I would be busy. Hailey said that if I came I could make a birthday cake like I di for my mom, and Ian would love it. I said I really don't care after what he did on her bday. Hailey said I don't understand their relationship and if I refuse to bake a cake it will only make things worse, because he doesn't have a kid who would do things like that for him. I said I really don't care. But now I feel guilty because I hurt Hailey's feelings, and maybe this would actually make things better between my mom and Ian, and maybe I'm judging Ian too harshly.

I think he was (and is?) quite resentful of her because he was dealt a shittier hand - my mom has no real health issues, she has a lovely husband and a lovely daughter (I hope, lol), and a stable job. He's now in a better place financially and my mom has been trying to rebuild their relationship, they text often and even call a few times a month. 

For my mom's birthday this year I got plane tickets for my mom, dad, and me to go stay with Hailey's family in the city my mom grew up, so we could have some of her oldest friends over to celebrate. And I baked a cake. This was a surprise for my mom, but I asked Hailey if it was alright beforehand, and she was excited and up for it. But when we arrived I found out that Ian was also visiting, which Hailey hadn't told me. I asked her about it and she said she forgot to tell me because she didn't think it was a big deal, apparently he visits often. Ian was friendly with my mom, and she seemed happy he was there, so I thought it would be okay. I told Ian the night before my mom's bday about the party plan, and asked if he wanted to attend or had other plans. He said he was going  out with friends that morning but he would be home by evening for the party.

  
My mom's friends arrived at 5 and Ian wasn't home, I thought he'd come soon, but he wasn't home even by 10 and my mom's friends started to have to leave. I called Ian several times and so did Hailey, but he didn't pick up. My mom was really upset because she assumed he would be there, and initially when she asked I'd confirmed that he would. Eventually we did cut the cake without him, and he came home at around 12:30 after my mom's friends had all left. I didn't say anything to him. Hailey tried telling me he didn't mean to make my mom sad.I was really angry but I didn't want to cause drama and make my mom more upset. We went home the next day. 

Recently Hailey invited my me and parents to visit again to celebrate Ian's birthday. My parents are going, but I said I would be busy. Hailey said that if I came I could make a birthday cake like I di for my mom, and Ian would love it. I said I really don't care after what he did on her bday. Hailey said I don't understand their relationship and if I refuse to bake a cake it will only make things worse, because he doesn't have a kid who would do things like that for him. I said I really don't care. But now I feel guilty because I hurt Hailey's feelings, and maybe this would actually make things better between my mom and Ian, and maybe I'm judging Ian too harshly.

45,1ej5jkl,WIBTA If I decided against illustrating my sister's book?,"Hello All! I (31F) have a sister (33F) who wants to self-publish a Halloween kids book by October 1st of this year. Being a visual artist, she insisted that I illustrate it for her, as I have helped her in similar ways for other projects of hers. I reluctantly agreed (verbally), reluctant because that is a lot of work and pressure on me, especially since my specialty is animals and this story is entirely people based. She intends on paying me $600AUD for 20 fully rendered drawings, to be done by September 22nd. She sent me an email that drafted out all of the pages and picture ideas for the book, I didn't have time to look through it properly within a day of her sending it, and she sent me a disappointed text message that night that basically said ""If you can't take 5 minutes to read the email, then it won't be done by the deadline. I'm sad and disappointed as I was hoping we could do this together. I would need to find someone else to illustrate this and the Dudley book that you wanted to do."" The Dudley book refers to a kids book based on our beloved late dog, that I always expressed interest in illustrating, she claims that she'd need to keep the same illustrator for consistency's sake. 

She emotionally backed me into a corner, I hate confrontation so much that I remediated the situation by assuring her that I'm willing to do it. But now I'm having second thoughts. I'm worried that if I stress and work myself to the bone to get this done in time, then she'll just throw another book for me to illustrate in time for Christmas and the cycle will continue forever. It takes her about 2 hours to write a story, but up to 50+ hours worth of work for me to illustrate it. Basically slaving away for far less than minimum wage. But I'm not sure if I've left this too late to back out, or if I would be the A-hole for saying yes, then saying no after and leaving her no time to find another illustrator.

He kept on playing voice notes of her for a while, even up until a few months ago.

He told me how disgusted he was by it, and how he couldn't believe that some of the people encouraging this were close with my grandmother before her unfortunate passing. However, I've alway suspected in the back of my mind that he might remarry, although I never spoke about. However, I recently learned that he found a girl he liked, and asked for her hand in marriage. I'm unsure of her age, though I think she's in her late 60s to early 70s.

47,1ej5fop,AITA for the way I handled my dad.,"Hi everyone, this might be a bit lengthy, but I (17) am currently living with my parents. Some time ago, my dad bought me my first car, but he frequently reminds me that it's technically his since it's still under his name. He often threatens to call the police and report it as stolen if I use it, even when I'm just going to work or out after asking my mom.
I'm reaching my limit. My dad (39) and my mom (34) have been together for a long time, and everything was okay until I turned 15. My dad struggles with anemia and alcoholism, which unfortunately affects his behavior, especially when he drinks. This has made our home environment very stressful. My little sister (8) often comes to me in tears because she feels scared.
For some background, both my mom and I work, and my dad works as well. He earns the most but often asks for almost all of my mom's money. He seems very unhappy. Last night, he was intoxicated and caused some damage around the house, including breaking a TV and my door. He insisted on taking the car, even though he was clearly not in a condition to drive. I offered to drive him because I had to work, but he was adamant that it was his car and that he pays for the insurance.
He tends to drive recklessly when he's late for work, which is very concerning. He's also said hurtful things to me, claiming I'm worthless and won't achieve anything in life. Additionally, he seems to be experiencing some paranoia, often believing that people are around the house when they're not. He has installed ring cameras and often invades our privacy, convinced that someone is there. He even wakes up in the middle of the night, recording and searching the house for intruders.
I worry that he might have a mental health condition because he sometimes wakes up scared, believing someone is trying to take him. He occasionally sleeps with the light on. When we express our frustration or concern, he sometimes cries and claims he doesn't remember his actions or tries to make us feel like we're the problem.
I want to help him, but I'm at a loss. I think he needs professional treatment, but I'm not sure how to proceed. My mom and I are exhausted and scared, and we don't have enough resources to move out and start over. Is there any way to get him the help he needs without his consent? Anything would be greatly appreciated.

I (nb 18) don't want to forgive my father (m something over the age of 40). All in all my father is African and my mother is German, my mother already had a child before me, my brother, tho his father had died. So then after some other guys my mother got with my father, they never married and my father also lied about there being war in his country. My father cheated on my mother when I was two years old with a woman who had the same name as me (my second name not first name). And I'm sure he cheated multiple times in general aswell, that's the only one I know of. The relationship between my parents was always complicated, always argued, always a problem that my father didn't wanna pay or some shit. I don't have good memory, I don't remember much of my childhood, tho it wasn't really bad, just a lot of arguing. Tho at some point my parents had a bigger argument and my mother made my father sleep on the couch for a few days, around that time he went to Africa alone. Two years later when they finally broke up they discussed child support money and stuff, and then my father revealed that he had another child in Africa in hopes of having to pay less. When I found out I cried, I was mad. He told me that 'You should be happy, I wanted another child' and whatever else he said, idk idc, just at that moment it was over for me. Then he moved out. At the start of it all he came every weekend for what I like to call, free food free wifi and free sex because my mother would provide. I was often forced to do things with my father then, like stay over at his place and go somewhere with him to his friends place. Every single time was horrible. I remember I sat at some dudes place I didn't know for 6 hours while staring into my phone while my father conversed in a language I couldn't understand. All in all I tearily called my mom and asked her to pick me up and she did, and then I started to completly refuse him. When he came on the weekends he'd demand respect from me, so I started refusing to open the door for him in general, I started to ignore him completly, not leaving my room when he was there. The most horrible was for me when my mother would make food or clean and whatever only because he was there, or atleast that's what it feels like.

She has released 3 songs and has an album on the way and they are just… bad. She’s got a horrible timbre, it’s flat and whiny with weird modulation in pitch. And she’s even worse live. All of her LA friends are gassing her up, telling her she is amazing and supporting her but I wonder to what extent it will hurt her in the future when someone in the industry finally says those words “you can’t sing.” I want to support her and her future but it’s tough to watch her actively and ambitiously pursue something she’s objectively bad at. Would it be better for a friend to say something, or should we all just wait it out? 

UPDATE: thank you everyone for a lot of constructive criticism and for calling me in (though some of you definitely called me out)!

All of her LA friends are gassing her up, telling her she is amazing and supporting her but I wonder to what extent it will hurt her in the future when someone in the industry finally says those words “you can’t sing.” I want to support her and her future but it’s tough to watch her actively and ambitiously pursue something she’s objectively bad at. Would it be better for a friend to say something, or should we all just wait it out? 

UPDATE: thank you everyone for a lot of constructive criticism and for calling me in (though some of you definitely called me out)! I appreciate the reminder that art is never objective and that singing is a skill that can be worked on. I’m going to continue to support my friend’s career and keep my mouth shut 🤗 ",1.0,1.0683435201644895,1,1
53,1ej3txb,WIBTA if I ask my friend we want the upstairs instead?,"Hey all I'm feeling very conflicted about an issue that's been ongoing and it' given me mixed feelings. I want to talk with my friend about it, but I feel like I'm going to be TA, but maybe I'm valid?

Okay now for the story. Back in November my friend's (calling her F for simplicity) mother died. She needed help  with things which I was more than okay helping with, but I found out Mom was a MASSIVE hoarder and she had a few habits as well. We cleaned up for months and moved her into a new house she's renting but there's still a ton of stuff she has yet to go through, the garage is still quite full and the basement is a bit overwhelming still. Now my bf(K) and I had agreed to move in with her because our old place was getting too expensive and we're trying to save money for a house (haha, good joke there....) while also helping to keep her on track to getting rid of more junk and she never really learned certain life skills, so sorta help with that too. 

Now the house we moved to has a 2 bd upstairs and a 2bd downstairs with kitchen. She moved in a few months before we could and moved into the downstairs because the upstairs was going through some renovations. But the original agreement was once the upstairs was done, shed move up there and have another roommate while we just kept the downstairs. She has a cat and a dog, but cat is notorious for spraying. She bought him some diaper things to keep him from spraying in the house but I don't think they were used often. We finally got our stuff moved out of our old place but since the garage was stuffed we had to rent a storage unit. So a good chunk of our stuff is in storage, the downstairs is flooded in her stuff and you can very much notice the odors. K said the upstairs is about the same size but the bedrooms are bigger while the living room is smaller. He wants to talk about us getting the upstairs because he thinks it's unfair for her to move upstairs and leave us to deal with the cat spray smells and flies. And while I do agree with him that it's unfair that we've done so much already and we get left with this, I feel like I'm going against the original agreement and going to be TA about how she doesn't really handle things.

Let's just say we are trying to be smart with our money because we have a lot of important things on the horizon coming up. If something happens with this current pregnancy we are looking at going through a 3rd round of IVF.

He gets back early this morning and hands me a bag...inside is an NBA sports team jersey. I'm a 41 year old woman...I don't dress at all sporty or in team jerseys (yes, maybe joggers and a tee but nothing like this). On top of that he bought a size small when I would be a large (it fits like a bandage dress ffs) but most importantly...he spent $120 on it. 

I am visibly upset, mostly at the cost, but also because this is just way off base. The sizing, the gift itself, the spending amount when he knows we have a lot of stress happening right now around money.

After months of getting the cold shoulder, being ignored and excluded from conversations between her and her other sisters in law, I finally asked what her problem was. 

For a bit of context.My BF is graduating in late October, and there will be a graduation dinner. A table at this dinner costs 420 dollars. A table seats 10 people. He, his parents, 2 brothers, his brothers fiance and girlfriend, Amanda and myself makes it 9 people. 

When my in laws asked my boyfriend who he wanted at the dinner, he said he wanted everybody there, except Amanda's boyfriend. Instead he wanted his best friend to have the 10th seat. 

I'm not gonna lie, it was my idea for my BF to invite his best friend. They're like brothers, and his best friend invited him to his graduation dinner a year ago, so it seemed fair. Also, Amanda has already expressed that she didn't really take her relationship seriously. Not only that, but she was having an affair with a man 10 years older who was also in a relationship. So her BF at the time really didn't matter that much to her (She said this herself).

A day after this, his mom called us and told us that Amanda's boyfriend should go to the dinner. She said that my BF was being disrespectful towards Amanda and her BF. She said that he would hate for me to be excluded, so he should invite Amanda's bf to the dinner. My BF said it wasn't personal against either of them, but that it was  his graduation dinner, and that he wanted those closes to him. 

A solution was given right away. We would just pay for a second table. That way we could invite Amanda's bf, his best friend, his best friends parents and some other family members. 

Since Amanda's boyfriend was going after all, we supposed the issue was over. I guess it wasn't.

Amanda said that she was mad at me because she knew that it was my idea to exclude her boyfriend,  not her bothers.

60,1eixm59,AITA for not wanting to have life dictated by my brother-in-law,"My wife (49) & I (f-46) have been together for 12 years. For 10 of those years, we've had a big part in raising our niece (her brother's daughter-13 yo), who has lived with us for nearly 9 years. My BIL had custody of her, however he had little interest in raising her so we took on the challenge. Throughout the 8+ years she has lived with us, BIL has expressed almost no gratitude whatsoever. I was okay with that because I'm not doing it for praise or recognition. I'm doing it because I love our niece. 

In addition to having expressed no gratitude, BIL consistently tried to dictate how we are to raise her, despite him having no interest in doing it himself. This has become more difficult to deal with over the years and BIL has developed resentment towards me. 

Recently he decided he wanted to take our niece from us, despite her clearly expressing that she doesn't want to live with him. After nearly a year of unsuccessfully trying to convince him to let her stay, my wife and I petitioned for and were granted custody of our niece last May. 
Although the court process was a lot of work and very nerve-racking at times, I felt a great deal of relief, like a sense of standing up to him & saying 'we will no longer be your puppets'. 
When visitation was set, the judge noted that BIL was responsible for picking up & dropping off my niece before and after visitation with her (1hr 10 min each way). As soon as the visitations began, my wife volunteered to drop our niece off to him and also pick her back up at the end of his visiting days. I told her that I was not comfortable with that as I feel like going to court & standing up to him sent a clear message that we will no longer play by his rules. But when she immediately began catering to him so he is not inconvenienced, I felt he was given a new message that says 'the rules have not changed at all, you still call the shots'. 
Additionally, my wife & I had previously discussed getting our niece a phone to use when she is away from us, such as when she is on a visitation with her father and also twice per season when she travels to the next county with her team for soccer scrimmages. Without re-discussing it with my wife, I got her a phone that is to be used almost entirely to make calls/texts to us & so that we may also be able to contact her. I have parental controls on the phone that I manage from my own device. My wife is very upset that I got the phone because her brother is very likely going to be angry that I did so. I had not put his number in her phone since my niece has it memorized and will mostly be with him at the times that she has the phone. My wife seemed upset that I had not put his number in the phone. She had also questioned whether my BIL would be in charge of the phone while our niece was with him, which seems illogical, given the reason she has the phone is so she can contact us if need be, without interference from BIL.

I was okay with that because I'm not doing it for praise or recognition. I'm doing it because I love our niece. 

In addition to having expressed no gratitude, BIL consistently tried to dictate how we are to raise her, despite him having no interest in doing it himself. This has become more difficult to deal with over the years and BIL has developed resentment towards me. 

Recently he decided he wanted to take our niece from us, despite her clearly expressing that she doesn't want to live with him. After nearly a year of unsuccessfully trying to convince him to let her stay, my wife and I petitioned for and were granted custody of our niece last May. 
Although the court process was a lot of work and very nerve-racking at times, I felt a great deal of relief, like a sense of standing up to him & saying 'we will no longer be your puppets'. 
When visitation was set, the judge noted that BIL was responsible for picking up & dropping off my niece before and after visitation with her (1hr 10 min each way). As soon as the visitations began, my wife volunteered to drop our niece off to him and also pick her back up at the end of his visiting days. I told her that I was not comfortable with that as I feel like going to court & standing up to him sent a clear message that we will no longer play by his rules. But when she immediately began catering to him so he is not inconvenienced, I felt he was given a new message that says 'the rules have not changed at all, you still call the shots'. 
Additionally, my wife & I had previously discussed getting our niece a phone to use when she is away from us, such as when she is on a visitation with her father and also twice per season when she travels to the next county with her team for soccer scrimmages. Without re-discussing it with my wife, I got her a phone that is to be used almost entirely to make calls/texts to us & so that we may also be able to contact her. I have parental controls on the phone that I manage from my own device. My wife is very upset that I got the phone because her brother is very likely going to be angry that I did so. I had not put his number in her phone since my niece has it memorized and will mostly be with him at the times that she has the phone. My wife seemed upset that I had not put his number in the phone. She had also questioned whether my BIL would be in charge of the phone while our niece was with him, which seems illogical, given the reason she has the phone is so she can contact us if need be, without interference from BIL. AITA? Honest opinions are appreciated.

61,1eiwz0d,AITA for taking my sisters cat to the vet ,"I (19f) have a sister (16f). My sister has been acting out lately, but she has been through a lot in her life so I get where some of this behavior is coming from. However lately she’s been fixated on getting a cat. As she really wants something to keep her company as my mom pulled her out of regular school. 

Long story short she bought a cat off Facebook market place after my mom said no. It’s a kitten that was in very bad condition, had fleas, was hungry, and just looked sick. She’s at my fathers house rn but lives with my mom most of the time and my mom found out. She’s understandably mad, and told my sister to bring it to the pound and that she can’t bring it back home when she comes back. (We already have a cat here, and my cat that’s visiting with me while I’m home from college.) 

My sister asked me to help drive her to the vet the day after she got it because she can’t drive yet and was worried about it. I did because I was also concerned for the kitten and didn’t want it to be in pain if it needed medication. It ended up having worms but is getting treated now.

When I got home my mom asked me where I was and I told her. She got angry at me and said I’m enabling my sisters bad behavior and being disrespectful to her. I tried to explain I just felt bad for the cat, but she said I should of just driven her to the pound and they could of taken it off my sisters hands and gave it medical help there.

She still isn’t talking to me a day later. I don’t think I did anything wrong because it’s not my job to settle this mess with the cat and my sister. (I did repeatedly tell my sister not to do it before she did tho). However I do understand my moms frustration with the situation, and my sister shouldn’t of done it in the first place.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-03,"AITA for taking my sisters cat to the vet  I (19f) have a sister (16f).

62,1eiwycc,AITA if my best man and groom accidentally took my wallet from my wedding and blame me for it,"
My best man and my groomsman both live in Florida and I live in tennessee and they came up to be in the wedding. Wedding went great and we all had a lot of drinks. Towards the end I was still talking to people before the dj says the bride and I “have to leave right now everyone is waiting”. We had no idea what that mean so we went downstairs and we are very confused when we see our relatives making a tunnel with their arms for us to drive to our hotel. We are many drinks deeps so we just go.

Next morning we have no car, no keys, no wallet since it got left at the reception and I ask my wife what happened to all of it. She told me that her mom and the bridal party cleaned up and grabbed everything after and was going to bring it to the air bnb in the morning. Later I get a text from my best man saying that the groomsman got called into work (which pissed me off because he said he got off) in Florida…and they carpooled…so they have to leave immediately. I don’t think too much of it and I make a mistake of assuming it my wallet got dropped off.

Come a few hours later after we meet with our in-laws we head back to the air bnb to pack up. No wallet (or the bag it was in with my jeans too). I call my best man and they have the wallet. They start to blame me saying I shouldn’t have forgotten in the first place and I get mad saying they had the wallet and they knew they had it so they should have made sure to drop it off.

My wife surprised me with tickets to Halloween horror night for our honeymoon and plane tickets so it was important that I had it since we left the next day (2 days after wedding). I got lucky and my mom was going to an airport which they were nearby and she had to drive back my wallet to me.

TL;DR

I forgot my wallet at my wedding and my best man and groomsman went to back home to Florida with it. They blamed me for forgetting it.

65,1eiw61x,AITA for being afraid of my family's dog?,"So, for a bit of context, I have always had a phobia and a general dislike for dogs. It has been this way since I was born. To me, it does not matter how small or friendly the dog is. If there is a dog, I will panic. Not only that, but they seriously gross me out. When dogs get close to me, my body triggers a gag reflex. It's not something I can help. And no, I do not have a dog allergy.

For my entire life, I have been painted as a villain for my views on dogs. It is no secret that people seem to practically worship these animals, and commonly think of them as part of their family. Whenever I would tell somebody that I do not like dogs, and have a phobia of them, they would look at me like I have just murdered someone. My family also knew very well the extent of my fear and dislike for dogs.

Now, my mother and my brother have always wanted to have a dog. My dad honestly couldn't care less, and I of course was very against the idea. So, when I was 11 years old, I just came home from a camping trip with my dad and brother, and saw my mom with a dog. She introduced it as our new puppy. I immediately started panicking. I ran into my room, and spent the rest of the day crying. I had no clue that this was coming. Nobody came to console me that day, because they just told me that I was being dramatic. From then on, since my body would physically not allow me to be around a dog without feeling nauseous or panicked, I felt that I couldn't leave my room.

I am 18 now, and these past 7 years have been a living hell for me. My mom grew obsessed with it, since she started to treat the dog as she would a child. They refer to the dog as my little brother. When it had to eat, she would make it full meals instead of using dog food. My mom also absolutely refused to leave the dog home alone. That meant that we couldn’t do anything together as a family if the dog was not allowed to come.

Every single event had to be centered around the dog. For example, on my birthdays I would open a present, and instead of people paying attention to me, they would be paying attention to the dog who would be tearing up the wrapping paper.

My mom in particular has it in her mind that I only behave this way in order to prove some sort of point. They say I am being cruel because I refuse to touch it, since they insist that the dog loves me.

All of this has resulted in me spiraling down into a deep depression. I hardly ever leave my room unless it's to quickly get food or water. No matter who I seem to talk to about this, they always seem to take my family's side, and call me a monster for hating dogs in the first place. I do not care if other people love dogs. It's not something that I personally understand, but people are never willing to listen to me.

So am I the AH for asking my parents for the money or should I just wait and save up for more?

72,1eiuqet,AITA for expecting my partner to (sometimes) put me ahead of their friends?,"I’ve been dating someone for the last few months and it’s been good but sometimes frustrating when they cancel our dates. This happens a lot because of their job but also because they seem to keep putting their friends ahead of me. (Sorry for all the ‘they/them’ pronouns but I want to keep this as gender-neutral as possible so that you aren’t biased either way.)

A few weeks ago, they said they couldn’t meet because they were busy. When I asked about it the next day they told me that they were having a drink with “a friend of a friend who I don’t even like” because that person was in town and was too shy to go out alone (it wasn’t even their first time visiting the city so I don’t know why my partner had to be the chaperone). Then last week they cancelled because they had to go IKEA shopping with their best friend who, my partner said, “needs me because they don’t trust anyone else’s taste”.

The worst happened yesterday. We had plans to meet up for lunch and agreed on it well in advance (confirmed again the day before). I also texted them in the morning to say how excited I was and again an hour before to share the address again. I never heard back. Then I get to the restaurant, call them three times in the space of fifteen minutes, and eventually get a quick text saying: “I can’t talk, one of my best friends had his brother pass away last night”.

Obviously I was NOT expecting my partner to just ditch their friend at such a difficult time. But I was still upset that they couldn’t take ten seconds to respond to me and cancel our plans so that I didn’t rearrange my day, go all the way to a restaurant, and feel like an idiot for being stood up. I know that people don’t think clearly when there is a crisis or a tragedy but the fact that I didn’t even occur to them makes me wonder if I’m as important to them as they are to me.

I don’t know. The whole thing is a mess and I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable to expect someone who says they want to date me exclusively to at least keep me in mind more than that they do. (This doesn’t even get into the fact that they spend more time updating their Instagram profile and stories than they do responding to my texts.) Any perspectives would be appreciated. Thank you!

Her dad passed away like a week and a half ago, and it's been really hard on everyone, especially her I'm sure. 

We hangout a lot. My cousin doesn't have many friends of her own, so I usually invite her to hangout with my group of friends.

We're all home for college and decided to throw a little party to make her feel better. My friends are coming and we were making her favorite food and we bought an ice cream cake, which is her favorite. We were also going to watch a movie that she loves together.

But the thing is 12 of my friends would be there and they always look amazing. Like hair done, nails done, etc. My cousin doesn't usually try with her looks but I was still shocked when I picked her up and she looked HORRIBLE.

Her hair had not been brushed. She was wearing an oversized shirt with no kaki pants and her legs weren't even shaved. No makeup. Yeah, she normally looks like that at our house but we were going out to see my friends and I was so embarrassed.

I told her that she looks like shit, she should go change. 

She said these are all the clothes she has, everything else needs to be washed.

She came to our house immediately after with her mom because her mom was a mess. But yeah, I told her that I wasn't trying to be rude, that I just felt embarrassed she was going out like that. I told her she could borrow my makeup but I wasn't thrilled about it because it's kinda gross, but I offered it because she was upset.

But instead she just said she wasn't going with me anyway and went back to our house. She hasn't spoken a word to me since even though we're in the same house.

75,1eitk5z,AITA for not checking on my friend after she dropped out of my wedding party?,"I was very excited to ask 2 of my girls who I see the most to be in my wedding party. Let's call them (Lisa & Shelley). 

They both said yes and it was great. But 3 months in (4 months before the wedding), Lisa said she couldn't afford it and was dropping out. I said it was alright but I was a bit hurt. 

I had so far asked them to buy a dress that was around $100-$120, and had paid for drinks and food at the one meeting we've had. 

Lisa (& her bf) both work and make decent money, and pay low rent since I rented them a suite as I manage a building so I was confused that they couldn't afford it.

Shelley isn't working MUCH so I said I could help her pay for her dress if it would help.  

After Lisa dropped out I asked Shelley if she was still ok doing it. Her & Lisa are very close also so I just wanted to be sure. She said she did and that was great.

That same night on our group chat with the other 4 girls in the wedding party, Shelley started texting that it was crazy I expected them to pay $100 for a dress to be in the wedding and dropped out on the chat. 

I was really hurt and felt confused why 2 of my closest friends who I have ALWAYS been there for, wouldn't step up to be a part of my wedding when I would do ANYTHING to be in theirs if they asked.

As my wedding isn't far I needed to replace one of them soon and knew the perfect girl to do it, so I asked her the next day so she could have time to prepare etc. 

She was SO happy, and said she'd be honored. I had wanted to ask her but we already had 6 people each, so I was happy that I got a chance to after what had happened. It honestly made the hurt of my 2 ""besties"" dropping out a bit less.

I didn't need to replace Lisa because her bf was in the wedding party too so they just both dropped out.

After about a week of nothing from Shelley I get a text message saying how awful it is that I didn't check on her to see how she was doing or to make sure she didn't want to do it before I replaced her.  

I am absolutely FLOORED that she is angry with me about this! 

She has since sent me messages saying how hurt she is and that she doesn't know me anymore and has started saying BAD things about my fiance to people they both know.

I don't even know if there is a friendship to salvage after this.

Hi, I, 32 yr old female, recently moved my 2 yr old son, 4 yr old GS dog, and myself into my boyfriend’s house.  We have neighbors now, who also have dogs. My German shepherd Lola, isn’t used to having neighbors. The adjustment has been stressful to say the least. Which leads me to tonight’s incident. It’s a Friday, boyfriend and I have worked a long day, just trying to enjoy a cold on in the shop, while our son plays. Next thing you know we hear a bark from the neighbors dog. I’m thinking ‘seriously!’ I find Lola chasing after one of the neighbors dogs (who mind you was in my yard.. (it’s important later)). The old woman immediately starts yelling. At this point Lola is no longer chasing the little dog, she is making her way into the house because she knows she messed up. 
The woman continues to yell at me to get my dog under control. I proceed to ask her if her dog is okay. She continues to yell. So i asked her “was your dog in my yard?” She said what? I repeated myself. She said that’s not the point. We have all had problems with your dog. I told her “Your dog comes into my yard everyday to pee. Do you want to know how I know? I watch for him. For the simple fact I know that he is scared of my dog. Now I’m going to ask you to keep your dog in your yard. And before you accuse Lola of anything you’ve heard. I doubt you got the full story.” She said. Lucy would never! (The other neighborhood dog) i said look just keep your dog out of my yard and I will do the same. 
The argument got heated if im being honest. Some of its a blur. I do know she told me I needed to respect my elders because she didn’t like how I was talking to her. I did tell her you are not my elder. I dont know you and you don’t know me. She told me I don’t try. I said try? So what I’m a little anti social?

79,1eit34q,AITA for roasting her new guy in the group chat with friends?,"My friend, Ashley, is upset at me and the rest of my friends for not acting super supportive about her crush.

I'll say that Ashley hasn't had a group of friends before. She told us that this was the first groupchat she had been in with girls and that made me super happy for her.

But because she hasn't had a group of friends before, she doesn't get that part of having friends is that sometimes they clown on you.

She had been telling us about her crush for awhile and our friends were bugging her for a picture. She finally drops one.

I've been there before but if you are dating someone that isn't attractive, your friends are gonna roast them. I've seen a bunch of memes that are like, ""defending yourself after posting a picture of him in the groupchat and promising it's a bad picture."" I've been there myself.

The last few guy she dated was cute, but this one wasn't. Like at all. I don't want to be rude and describe how he looks, so I'll just leave it as... yeah, he's ugly/mid looking.

So obviously people in the groupchat, our friends, pointed that out. They were kinda making jokes about it. I joined in because it was stupid jokes.

I couldn't believe it but she actually got upset? She said she didn't like the way we talked about him and she hasn't said a word in the groupchat since. She told me she was upset and I said she should have expected that reaction if her man wasn't attractive? I told her it's happened to me before, it's not personal, and there are a bunch of memes of people jokingly having their men roasted in the groupchat. Attractiveness is subjective anyway, I guess. He was just not attractive to us and we said that.

But she is taking it the wrong way. I sent her some memes, hoping to show her that this is normal friend banter. But she didn't respond, she is way butthurt about this and I don't get it.

80,1eit213,WIBTA if I asked my flatmate to get permission to use my belongings?,"I've been friends with my flatmate for 10 years, but recently, he’s started doing things that bother me. He often asks when I’ll be out on Friday nights or weekends, and I suspect it’s so he can invite a friend over who plays League of Legends on my monitor in our study.

I did give him permission to use my gaming PC to play League of Legends before, but he began rushing home to use it during work breaks and before I got home. I had to tell him to stop because I have a flexible work schedule and often return home to work or study in the afternoons. I also use the PC for gaming in the evenings.

Last night, I came home to find his friend using my gaming setup without asking me first. They didn’t offer to let me use it, and that really irritated me. It felt disrespectful that they didn’t even check if I needed the monitor because as I mentioned I like to game in my free time and I do this in the evenings.

This isn’t the only issue. My flatmate frequently uses my coffee beans and snacks without asking. While he sometimes replaces them, it’s frustrating that he doesn’t ask for permission first. I feel uncomfortable leaving my things in the kitchen because I know he might use them.

I’m concerned that if I don’t address this now, he’ll think it’s okay to use my stuff and that of others without asking. I understand that we’re long-time friends, but I believe in basic courtesy.

81,1eit16j,AITA for arguing with my dad because my family ate my food after my tooth extraction?,"For context I’m 17F and I have a dad(67M), a mom(59F), a sister(26 in 4 weeks, with untreated psychosis), and a brother(22M, who has autism and needs a caretaker)



What happened was I had a tooth extraction on Monday, July 29th and before then I had bought soft foods like yogurt, ice cream, soup, ramen, etc the day before because my family only goes to the store on weekends. 



 I bought more food for myself because I knew my family was going to eat my food and they saw it was a green light be eat more. I bought a week’s worth of food and at least 1/4 or 1/5 of it was gone within less than 24 hours of my tooth extraction. I bought 10 yogurts and 6 were left, I bought a pint of lactose-free ice cream because I’m lactose intolerant and half of it was gone and it’s not like my family goes outside anyways except my dad plus only my mom is lactose intolerant other than me and my sister was the one who ate most of it, I had 5 cans of soup and 3 were left and I tried hiding them too so it wouldn’t be eaten but that didn’t work but luckily it seemed no one found where my ramen was. 



After I found that out I was furious because I felt like I was not important enough to eat my own food that I needed. Plus I had woken up from a 3-hour nap and the numbness was wearing off and my jaw and gums were starting to hurt and I was developing a headache so I raised my voice because of all of that. I was mad that I couldn’t even have something for myself when I needed it and everyone looked at me like I was in the wrong. The yelling didn’t last long because my dad yelled right back at me telling me how selfish I was for not wanting to share my food. I wouldn’t mind sharing if they weren’t eating the only food I could, my dad, mom, sister, and brother were all eating my food. My dad was eating my yogurt along with my brother and like I said my brother eats if you give him food so I wasn’t mad at him. My mom was eating my yogurt and ice cream while my sister ate 2 of my soups and was eating my yogurt and ice cream. I don’t get how I was selfish when they were eating the only food I could eat at the time. My dad then said that he’d just buy more in a few days but we only go to the store on weekends because my dad has work on the weekdays and it was only Monday and all that food was already gone and I didn’t think I’d have enough to last me that long.



I just wish I had a license and car or a card so I could drive and buy myself more food or have a debit card or something so I could order myself food to arrive at my house but I can’t. I have a card but I’m not allowed to spend the money on it and if I did it would just cause more problems for me and my head was already hurting so it wasn’t worth it.

She is not trying to hide it low, it is directly in front of her face and it is continuous. The people to our right were also talking through the whole movie so I was already annoyed. I became fed up and I leaned forward tapped her shoulder and said can you put your phone down. She then angrily turned around and said “ did you just touch me”. Then made a little bit more of a scene to her partner before going back to sitting and texting the rest of the movie. 

At the end I was trying to leave and she asked me if I wanted to apologize to her for pushing her. I wouldn’t have said I had “pushed” more then tapped but I said sure I will apologize for that. I didn’t mean to push you but you were texting the entire movie and I was trying to get your attention, she continued to be hostile saying this is her first night out and she was texting her nanny the whole time. At one point she even says there’s no way her phone could have been bothering me because I was above her. I tried to explain that with her screen open it’s hard not to be distracted but at this point we are both just talking over each other. The arguing continues as security comes over and there is no resolution in site so I eventually walk away with my partner pulling me . 

I really can’t imagine I pushed vs tapped however perhaps I did given my frustration was really building between the people talking on our right and her texting in front. Either way I did touch her which… is a learning lesson for me for sure.

84,1eisqn0,AITA for calling my dad a male chauvinist after he showed ZERO empathy when I complained about being a woman in tech??,"Posting this on a throwaway account on the offchance my dad finds this.

I am 26F, work in tech as a software engineer, and I had a really rough day today. Actually it's been a rough week. I was laid off early last year and only managed to land a new job in May. I've been living with my dad for the last year to save on rent.

I constantly feel like I'm not good enough at my job. A large part of this is because I feel like I’m constantly getting undermined. For example, a lead on a partner team I have to work with constantly goes over my head to ping my mentor and boss, even though he knows I am the project lead. I feel like I get constantly talked down to or ignored. It is a large codebase to ramp up on, so when I’ve been unfamiliar with how some parts of it work, I feel like some team members use that as confirmation that I’m not good at programming. All in all I’ve been feeling very demotivated and disempowered. 

I was explaining all of this to my dad. He initiated the conversation when he noticed I was upset after a meeting. Instead of genuinely listening and being supportive, he basically pushed me down even further. Maybe he was just trying to play “devil’s advocate”, but it was not what I needed. I felt like he was blaming me for the problems and implying that I’m encountering this because I’m not presenting myself well enough or am being too sensitive or maybe that I am not good enough to be the leader of my project area yet.

I was already upset and hearing him challenge me on this, on me literally just sharing my feelings with him, made me want to scream. I said some heated things I’m not proud of but he escalated it. For example I first tried to disengage by saying “You know what? Forget it, never mind. You wouldn’t get it” and he kept egging me on saying “What wouldn’t I get? Why wouldn’t I get it? Just say it”. So I did. 

I said he wouldn’t get it because he’s a shitty dad and a chauvinist who has no empathy for any perspectives or feelings other than his. 

Some other heated words were exchanged and it ended with me breaking down into tears and him extremely upset. Now we are not talking.

I feel like shit for some of the awful things I said to him but I am so frustrated. We haven’t communicated all day and when I tried to talk to him in person he wouldn’t look me in the eyes and he just said in a quiet voice that my words really hurt him today.

I understand that but I feel like I am owed an apology as well. Why should I be the one groveling for his forgiveness when he was the one who started this and showed zero empathy to my feelings or problems?

She’s called me a bitch before, and she’s called me other pejoratives like “Dick” and “dipshit.” I decided that I’d give her a taste of her own medicine and when she called me a bitch, I said, “bitch, who are you calling a bitch?” She didn’t seem to be bothered that time, but another time she called me a Dick, so I immediately responded by calling her a bitch. This upset her and she told me not to talk to her.

87,1eisinw,AITAH For Holding a Cart With A Squirming Toddler In It,"I just used a throwaway because I didn’t want alerts on my main because I’m still feeling a little raw about it.

I’m at the grocery store and once I’ve grabbed the few things I needed I hop in line behind a woman who has a pretty full cart and a toddler in the cart seat. I figured it would be a minute so I just started messing around on my phone. I hear the cashier make an “oof” sound and look up and the cart is almost empty but the toddler (maybe around 2?) is wiggling around, trying to stand up and it’s making the cart tilt because it’s now mostly empty. I put down my hand basket and grab the sides of the handle on the cart so the kid does t accidentally try to stand and  tilt the whole cart over almost falling out. The cashier gives me a “thank you” smile and I don’t think anything of it. The kid wasn’t being obnoxious or anything, she had a doll in her hand she was clearly excited about and was talking to it and wanted everyone around her to see it. She was just a little overexcited and mom was talking to the bagger about whether the meats should be separate, did she want the milk in a bag - really normal stuff so she didn’t notice what was happening. 

But the kid was still jumping around a lot as the cashier was pulling the last few things out of the cart and I finally said “hey sweetie, you’ll want to sit on your bottom until your mom gets the cart back.” The kid doesn’t understand and just keeps telling me about her doll, she’s really young so I didn’t expect her to but thought I’d try. Mom hears it and EXPLODES on me. “Why are you touching my kid?!” I wasn’t. My hands were clearly on the sides of the handle. “Why the fuck are you scolding my kid”?” I mean I wasn’t even scolding her the quote above is all I said. She is just screaming at me and I don’t deal with that well and started to tear up and tried to explain that I just didn’t want the cart to tip but she just screamed over me so I don’t think she heard a word I said. Everyone in the neighboring lanes was looking at us probably thinking I’m some huge prick who touches kids. And this woman probably had like 100 pounds on me, I’m pretty small and she was getting super close to my face to the point I backed up and accidentally bumped into the woman behind me. That lady was incredibly sweet and grabbed my arm and pulled me next to her and told the mom “I think you need to pay and leave .” I’m not sure if this woman was behind me the whole time this happened but I think she saw enough to know I wasn’t some weirdo lady trying to touch her kid. I really don’t think  I’m an asshole as I wasn’t doing anything nefarious but I’m just so embarrassed and barely slept because I hate interactions where it’s like you feel like you were doing the right thing and someone just reacts like that.

88,1eisdbi,AITA for not going to grandmothers rosary due to my PCOS?,"Hi everyone, I’ve just been diagnosed with pcos since February. My symptoms have increased with pain and pulling, I’ve been experiencing irregular periods since I was 10 never had cramps until 18, and now currently in my 20s just been diagnosed after all these years due to the pains, pale white skin caused by the pain, excessive sweating, and pulling, squeezing pinching pain that last for minutes or seconds on a loop. (Side note) my doctor says I cannot be stressing whatsoever due to a possible inflammation or burst. I feel nauseous and it hurts to stand and sit for long periods of time. It gets worse when I’m on my period. For the past couple of weeks I have been stressing out due to the recent death of my grandmother. It’s been a month since I had my period, the stress went down after the funeral which was last weekend.

 I noticed signs of pain on my right ovary which has the most cysts. I didn’t think much of it I since I’m used to the pain at this point, I’m on day 5 with my period and the first day wasn’t so bad, I went to the rosary. The second day was ok, some pain here and there, but still went to the rosary. The third day I was experiencing a lot of pain and sweating profusely while hyperventilating. My cousin noticed but assumed I was being disrespectful, when I told her I’m having pain from my ovaries due to these cysts, she just turned her head while saying “why don’t you sit down?” I told her it hurts when standing or sitting for long periods of time especially when I’m on my period. I didn’t go on the fourth day, but that was because I had taken a nap I felt drained and was exhausted. Today I feel nauseous, I took acetaminophen, then ibuprofen but nothing worked at all. I drank warm tea but that didn’t help. I experience sweats due to the pain, I had a bad headache and felt very dizzy. I can’t sit and couldn’t stand while folding laundry which was earlier in the day. I take birth control pills to help me have regular periods and also metformin for my blood sugar due to the hormones increasing my glucose level. I have eaten for those who are wondering, but I don’t have an appetite and feel nauseous, the pain is just throbbing and I feel bad. I just know that my family is going to complain about me especially when they come home. I spoke to my therapist on what to do when they confront me on why I didn’t go, my mothers side of the family talks a lot of BS about people well mainly the siblings (aunts/uncles), it’s sad. I spoke to my therapist about what to do in case I get yelled at or want a reason on my absence. He says it’s valid due to my health and since the family causes stress I shouldn’t stress due to the pain. So will I be the Asshole for not attending my grandmas rosary?

89,1eis5z3,AITA for not speaking to 2 of my best friends because they still hang out with my ex who was not there friend while we were together? ,"so, for reference im 15f and these girls are clara 15f and sienna 15f (not their real names). i have been friends with clara since prep (australian school) and we are now in year 10, and i have been friends with sienna since year 7. my ex boyfriend lets call him rob hes 16m.  rob and i dated when i was 13-14 and he was 14-15. rob cheated on me multiple times in the 13 months we were together and everyone except me was aware of this, including sienna. clara only moved to my school this year, while i have actually moved to a different school but i still have to see them everyday regardless to take the train home. my new school is only down the road from my old one and the train station.

recently i made 2 posts regarding rob, because (tw) rob sexually assualted me while we were together but i was unaware of the fact until i reached out after a bit of skepticism about it. i have informed clara and sienna of this, and all of the horrible things that he did to me during our relationship. he gaslit and manipulated me into staying with him and played the victim.

so lets get into how this began.

i was on the train going home with sienna clara and rob and a couple of our other friends, and i absolutely did not want rob there but clara and sienna insisted, so of course, i talked about my current boyfriend who treats me incredibly, and i was saying things like ""im so glad i left u rob"" because he is a horrible person and deserves nothing more than to be spoken to like that. then sienna says that she prefers rob over my current boyfriend (lets call him jordan, hes 16m) and of course, that offended me because rob has made me go through literal hell. luckily, that was said as soon as i and clara had to get off the train, so we did and we didnt speak of it. i was fairly mad at sienna and i didnt speak to her for quite some time, which included sitting with her on the train. after maybe a week or two, i messaged sienna explaining why i was mad and why her words upset me, and she completely played the victim and acted like she never said that. 

this was a couple months ago, and we still have not spoken in person, yet clara and sienna continue to sit with rob and hang out with him. clara and sienna have only known each other since february, while i have grown up with both of them, yet every single day clara walks past me to go and sit with rob and sienna. i have had multiple back and forth messages with them both discussing how this makes me feel and yet they dont stop. 

  
as my best friends, they should understand the trauma that comes with seeing rob every day and how i get scared around him, yet they just continue to be with him. now, i have only told 4 people about this situation: my boyfriend jordan, my best friend (lets call him marcus 16m), my friend (lets call her jasmine 13f) and another friend (lets call her angelica 16f). i only told angelica because she asked, i only told jasmine because clara was talking bad about me to jasmine, and i only told jordan and marcus because they are the closest people to me and i didnt know what to do. but on the other hand, clara has been going out of her way to message everyone we know with screenshots and explain the situation to them in a completely wrong way. 

marcus recently showed me messages of clara saying that i was ridiculous and out of line and immature for not replying to them anymore as i cant be bothered. clara is also mad that i missed out on her birthday party, and she is convinced i didnt go because sienna was there but i have explained to her various times that i had to spend that night at the nursing home with my elderly grandmother. she was very unwell and we were spending the night with her to make sure she got some sleep and didnt fall over again. i have apologised to her for this and told her i will make it up to her many times, but i feel as though if she doesnt believe me it is not my job to convince her. my family will always come before her and that night could have possibly been the last time i saw my grandmother (thankfully she is a very strong woman and it wasnt). 

i keep on getting messages from all of our mutual friends telling me that im in the wrong and that i should just apologise to them and that im an asshole for not going to her birthday party, but as someone who has been put through so much because of rob, i feel like i absolutely have the right to be mad that they are choosing my sexual assualter over me.

For context, he isn’t working right now and he’s been looking for a job for about a month now. Even when he was working and before I made my promotion, I was still making more than he was by like a dollar or two. But now in this new position I’m in, I make x2 what I was making before so I can afford a lot more than I used to. So for example he was making around 40,000 a year and now I make double that. With that being said, we both agreed to live in a 2 bedroom apartment but I said that I didn’t want to pay more than 1800 (we live in FL). When he did have a job, I said that we could go either 70/30 or 80/20, whichever one would be easier for him. I didn’t mind paying more in rent because I can afford it compared to him. But he’s been feeling sad and not in the greatest mood because of his current financial situation so I offered to get a 1 bedroom and he could live rent free so he could pay his debts (hoping he’d have a job by the time we move). He didn’t like this idea because he doesn’t want to live in a 1 bedroom because there isn’t enough space, hence why we agreed on a 2 bedroom. I do not want to pay for a 2 bedroom for him to stay rent free because it would be more money in rent compared to the 1 bedroom. He said it is selfish and disgusting knowing that I can pay at least 2000 in rent that I would make him pay rent in the 1 bedroom (after he clears up his debt). I’m trying my best to be helpful by offering him to live rent free but I’m afraid of being taken advantage of and I’ve expressed that to him as well. I have thought about getting the 2 bedroom and he could live rent free for a few months (which we would agree upon) until his debts were clear and he could pay what he could afford.

 - Three days ago, my dad got drunk and blamed me for my mom's death like he did dozens of times before(she died giving birth to me, so I suppose it is my fault).

He has 3 children.14m, 10m, 8f
Relevant info: he’s pretty much a single dad. Their mom only sees them about once a month. She will take them for a weekend every month or two. 

He asked me to watch the kids Saturday and Sunday. I said yes. It’s not the first time I’ve had the kids and they’ve stayed at my place. They stay every three months or so. Not because my brother needs someone to watch them, but because I enjoy spending time with them. I see them more often, they just don’t sleep at my apartment all the time. I usually go to my brothers to help him there. 

I wish they stayed at my apartment more, but that touches on my point. He’s never paid me and I’ve never asked him too. I don’t want him too. I love the kids and I enjoy spending time with them and doing things with them. I take them to the movies, hockey games, shopping. We also do free things like playing video games, going on hikes and walks. They also just love chilling at my apartment. Sometimes they literally just want to sit at my apartment and just chill. I love it because I love them so much. They are great kids. 

However, as they’ve gotten older they are starting to eat more. Especially the boys. My 14 yo nephew can eat more than me! Which I think is natural. But with inflation, it’s actually starting to get really expensive to feed them. I feel horrible about it, but there’s been times even when we just hang out at my place that it costs hundreds of dollars just to feed them. Sometimes it affects my ability to save money. I feel horrible saying it because I love them and don’t regret any of it. One of the last times the kids stayed at my place I sort of hinted at that to my brother. He does make more money than me. 

My mom told me today that my brother plans to pay me $200 when I pick up the kids tomorrow. For some reason I’m not feeling right about taking the money. I love the kids, I don’t want to feel like I’m a babysitter. But it will also help with feeding them.

97,1eir3ms,AITA for being too open about my reasons for not drinking at a family dinner?,"

I'm a 34-year-old man who hasn't consumed alcohol since the beginning of 2023. I have a 2-year-old daughter and a lot of lingering trauma from my dad drinking a lot. He wasn't an alcoholic in the traditional sense—he still worked and provided a good life for us materially—but he was always drinking. I could never connect with him outside of his drinking. The smell of alcohol, the slurred words, the way his mood would change—it all left a mark on me. I don't want the same for me and my child. I want to be present and fully engaged in her life without the influence of alcohol.

Everyone in my life has accepted my decision except my father-in-law. He constantly asks why I don't drink and makes jokes like, ""Oh, it's just wine, it's just grape juice,"" because he thinks it's hilarious. I've told him multiple times that I don't drink, but he doesn't take me seriously. It's frustrating and tiring to keep saying no.

Last week, we met my wife's sister's fiancé for the first time (they live in a different country). We were all getting dinner, and the fiancé asked what I was drinking. I said nothing, and he asked why I don't drink. I kind of lost it. I told him the truth—that my dad was a drinker and I don't want to put my child through what I went through. He looked taken aback and didn't say much after that.

Later, my wife told me that I was an asshole for being so open about it at the first meeting and making things awkward. She said there was no need to bring up my dad's drinking and that I should have kept it simple. I argued that I've had enough of being questioned about my choices and that maybe now her dad will get the message too.

She is autistic and didn’t find that out until somewhat recently despite a lot of things pointing towards this, and I have some mental health issues and things from my past that cause me to struggle with relationships. She was clingy and anxious and quick to spiral, and I was avoidant and angry. It got very bad, and I eventually blocked her & told her I didn’t love her — something I really regret, but as of recently we’ve reconnected and I realized I do truly love her and want to be with her.

The issue comes with some rings she bought off Amazon close to the end of our relationship. While it was toxic, we had a lot of good moments and memories and at that time, she was going through a lot and had just recently got out of a job that was extremely damaging to her mental health.

101,1eipyyr,AITA for refusing to give up the family dog?,"My (23F) husband (27M) has told me that he no longer wants to keep one of our family dogs.

For context, we first got this dog from my husband's mother when he was around 16 weeks old when she found him and two of his siblings on the side of the road; he is now around 18 months old. We took him in to ease her load, and since then, his brother was put down due to aggression, and his sister got hit by a car. All three dogs were destructive and reserved around humans. Luckily, we spent much time with our dog and got him to trust us. We got a DNA test done, and the results showed that he is a mutt. He has every sort of bread in him you could imagine: German shepherd, pit bull, bulldog, Australian shepherd, and even chow (to name a few). Part of me has wondered if he's too much of a mixed bread to train correctly and has lousy genetics.

This dog is my husband's dog; even though it was a joint decision to bring him into the family, he bonded with my husband. Their relationship has been strained recently as we've moved house, becoming homeowners. Our dog is high-energy. He can't sit still ever and has even put a significant dent in our living room wall. We have two young children, who he is never aggressive towards, but he constantly knocks them down, jumps on them, and scratches them. This dog also loves to chew on everything. He's destroyed countless toys, clothing items, Xbox controllers, and remotes. He has also started to chew on our deck and destroy the outside furniture and the hose. We try and redirect him, but he doesn't care. We've bought him stimulating toys and a bunch of sniffer treats, but he destroys everything we buy him. We spent over $2000 on training for him, and even after months, much progress has yet to be made.

Our yard is not fenced, but he is hooked up to a long leash to move while outside alone. He likes to dig holes and has been digging into our foundations over the last few weeks. It's caused the deck's wood to crack, and he's chipping away at the concrete. He's also tried to dig up our neighbor's fence, and we've had to fill it in numerous times.

That leads me to the problem. My husband no longer wants to keep him. He feels like we've tried everything we can afford to do to correct him. He worries he will cost us more money in the future, and we won't be able to repair whatever he breaks. He is also concerned that he will accidentally hurt the kids.

From my perspective, I feel guilty knowing that we took him in as our responsibility, and now we are giving up on him. I feel bad for the kids, who will be sad if he goes. I never felt connected too much to this dog, but I still view him as a part of this family, and a part of me struggles with the idea of not having him around. My husband now believes I am picking the dog over his happiness, as he continually feels financially stressed about what the dog will do next.

102,1ejanmw,AITA- my brother decided (day of) not to drive my cousin up north ,"This is about my brother vs cousin.

We have a trip planned with 10 people total. We rented a cabin up north that would take 4 hours to get there. My brother, maybe a month prior, told my cousin that he was willing to take her and her gf with him and his gf even though he really didn’t want to be stuck in the car with them for 4 hours. 

The week prior to this trip we find out our mom has stage 4 lung cancer. Devastating news. Everyone is visiting my mom, bringing her stuff, and suddenly caring about her when literally my family never did.

In the background, I start seeing if I can cancel this trip. I can’t cancel without basically losing all of our money. The week of I find out her cancer spread to her brain. 

Now my cousin talks to my brother and basically tells him he shouldn’t go and they plan on not going. Guilt tripping him. My brother lives with my mom and I see her the days that I can. She seemed “fine” and “normal” the days leading up to the trip.

In my head, I’m going back and forth about going or not going. I’m thinking my kids will have fun and that the other people are looking forward to it too. It would be nice to get away from everything so we decide to go.

The day of the trip my dad randomly has an appointment and he won’t reschedule because he’s an old Asian stubborn man that can’t navigate the hospital. So my brother takes him. This is late afternoon so he tells my cousin to go ahead since he didn’t want them to wait. My cousin didn’t pressure him to drive them since it “seemed like he had a lot going on”. Which he did.

So my cousins says her car needs an oil change so she’ll head out the next day. I’m thinking everything is good. The next day comes and she says there’s something wrong with her car and they dont recommend her driving it that far. I tell her to ask for a loaner, ask her sisters to borrow their car, ask someone! She says “I don’t want to bother them” and making up all kinds of excuses. And I’m like what about your gf? She says her car got totaled and that she’s been driving her car while she rides an electric bike which is news to me! It seemed like they didn’t even try.

Now they’re giving me the cold shoulder which I don’t even understand what I did wrong and won’t talk to my brother. Is there something I’m missing here?

",Asshole,2024-08-03,"AITA- my brother decided (day of) not to drive my cousin up north  This is about my brother vs cousin.

We have a trip planned with 10 people total. We rented a cabin up north that would take 4 hours to get there. My brother, maybe a month prior, told my cousin that he was willing to take her and her gf with him and his gf even though he really didn’t want to be stuck in the car with them for 4 hours. 

The week prior to this trip we find out our mom has stage 4 lung cancer. Devastating news. Everyone is visiting my mom, bringing her stuff, and suddenly caring about her when literally my family never did.
