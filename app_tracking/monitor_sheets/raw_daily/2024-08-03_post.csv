0,1eip7s7,AITA if I confront one of my best friend about trying to get with my boyfriend?,"A year ago my best friend 18f met her current boyfriend 19m. There was some hesitation from my friends side because she didn’t want to settle down into a relationship because she was talking to multiple guys at the same time and in her words he was ugly. This was said on multiple occasions but I didn’t say anything because she tends to be a judgmental person. 

They started going out after 4 months and have been together since. The problem started when I 18f went with her and her boyfriend to go see her boyfriend brother 22m. On the way home I mentioned the fact that I thought he was cute and she agreed with me saying I wish my boyfriend looked like him.

That weekend his brother went to pick her up so that they could spend time together. Later that day the brother added me on Instagram and we started talking. For two months while me and 22m  were speaking she made snarky remarks about how we would never end up together. 

We eventually started to go out with only made her comment worse she would tell me how he let her put her head on her shoulder and how he was supposedly speaking to many other girls she had no proof so I didn’t believe her. In the last couple weeks she has been repeatedly texting my boyfriend trying to get them to hang out just the two of them.

I honestly don’t know if I’m being dramatic and that there is nothing wrong here or if I should talk to her about it. AITAH?
