0,1ek1m8q,AITA - For wishing my Godmother to buy me an expensive gift after she ignored me my whole life?,"
Hello reddit! 

For starters, I'm new here and I've been listening alot of the stories of this subreddit on TikTok so I thought it could be useful to me to share my story. I know I shouldn't expect things from people just because, and I know this sounds like I'm spoiled somehow but hear me out.

My older sister grew up with her godparents living so near us. So near that they ""adopted"" me as their godson. They used to help us with school assignments, gave me rides to things and are usually very nice, but in a way I felt like our bond is not the same as their bond with my sister. Both my parents lost their father when they were young and my grandmothers died when I was a baby. So I have no grandparents and my godparents lived states away. I grew up feeling lonely and envying my cousins and sister for their bond with the rest of the family that I didn't manage to get it right. I'm autistic BTW and social interactions are so hard for me :(

For my godparents. They never tried to reach out for me. My aunts, that live in the same city as them, travel to my city or call my mum. They never bother to try to know me. The excuse always was that they were too busy. Back in 2017, I traveled to my mums hometown with her. It was overall a good trip. I got a chance to see my godparents and visit their house, which was nice cause the last time I went there I was a child. While I was there I couldn't actually talk to them cause they were busy doing stuff. What bothered me is that they were taking care of their grandchildren. I brushed it off, even tho I was hurt. I wasn't feeling well during the trip so I occupied myself with other things until the trip was over.  After that, she continued to ignore me as usual. Until she decided to travel to my hometown for the very first time! I was graduating high school and was very nervous to start college. During her stay I got really sick (urinary infection) and couldn't barely enjoy her company

The thing is that I'm a trans man, and I just went through top surgery, and I'm bored. I've been wanting a Nintendo Switch for so long, but I can't afford it on my own (I'm 23) with my  internship salary. My parents are already taking care of me, so it would be rude to ask them, so I was wondering if I could ask my Godmother to buy me one. I'm not from the US, and the Switch is rather expensive. That may sound that I'm spoiled, but I love giving gifts, doing things for people and I love to recieve as well... she never tried to reach out, and I'm too hurt to do so after she basically turned me down when I tried. Money doesn't seem to be a problem for her (I think) is the thought of asking her and to sound demanding and rude that bothers me. 

So... Am I the asshole for considering the idea of asking her to buy a switch? ",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-08-04,"AITA - For wishing my Godmother to buy me an expensive gift after she ignored me my whole life?

1,1ejvmim,AITA for not apologizing to my mum?,"I (22 f) live with my mum since I can't afford living alone while going to college. Usually I'm quite busy with studying, so I value my free time. I also like to spend a few days alone before doing something big with another person (for example going shopping or watching a movie together).

My mum has been single for a couple years and currently struggles from health issues. She's also quite direct (for example will openly discuss how bisexuality is just a phase in her opinion), which can be challenging from time to time. But she's also a caring person, who can give great live advice. I enjoy living with her and I understand, that her current health has caused her to become quite isolated: At the moment I'm her main source for social interactions, which I try to fulfill, but it's hard sometimes, since she only counts having a movie marathon as spending time together. Everything else we do together (for example eating meals, going shopping, having conversations or playing board games) doesn't count as quality time for her. She also doesn't want to try things that I suggest to spice up our quality time. Thus it's nearly on a daily basis that she complains I don't spend enough time with her and don't love her.

After I spent a little time with her this morning,  I wanted to work on my essay. My mum started to complain and asked me to eat breakfast and watch a movie with her (most movies we watch together are her choice, since she doesn't like what I suggest). I told her that I wanted to work, but was okay with eating breakfast together. So we had breakfast and while we ate my mum started playing a movie which I wasn't really interested in. After we finished breakfast I went into my room to get started with writing, when my mum began her usual complain of me neglecting her. I reminded her, that we spend yesterday evening together playing a board game and that watching movies wasn't the only thing one could do to spend time together.

While I opened up the document, my mum began telling me about a documentary about intersex people in sports, which she had seen last night, and then began to say some transphobic stuff (for example that trans women are only women, if they had bottom surgery) and I was done with that. I tried to correct her (for example pointing out flaws in her logic) and after she said something along the line of ""well, in my opinion this is correct"" I responded with ""yeah, I know, but opinion is and stays different"", thus ending our conversation.

I have to admit that my tone of voice was annoyed during our conversation. Now there's a tension between us; I know she wants an apology from me for my tone and not spending time with her. I'm sorry for how I spoke with her, but not for what I said. Still, I know that the mood around the house will only get better after I apologized and thus swept the whole issue under the rug again.

2,1eji139,AITA for planning a game night only for the couples in my friend group?,"I’m M25. My friend group are all in our early or mid 20s. We do typical friend group activities such as dinners, cocktail bars, hiking, game nights, etc. Often just all the guys will hang out or just the girls, but also very often the whole group gets together.

We are all couples (all longterm living together) except for Riley who is F23 and single. I have no issue with her personally, she’s funny and pleasant during group hang outs.

Riley’s been single for a while, lives alone, and says she feels no urge to get into a relationship. A few people in the group had tried to introduce her to people a few times but she ended up not being interested in any of them.

What bothers me is when the whole group of all couples is together, having just one single person totally throws off the dynamic. It makes the vibe awkward because everyone else has their person with them and Riley is just there alone. It also totally makes our group an odd number which throws off restaurant seating and sways game nights. 

In restaurants it’s especially weird because we have to explain how we’re splitting checks as couples and then just Riley by herself. Also sometimes when one of the guys is sitting on either side of Riley, a waiter will assume he’s her boyfriend by the seating pattern and it messes up the checks and creates an awkward situation.

My gf and I are planning to host game night next weekend and I suggested that we only invite the couples to this one. She asked what I meant and I basically said only the people in our friend group who are couples so it can be a couples game night. My gf said that would only be acceptable IF our friend group was a solid mix of couples vs. single people, but otherwise it’s literally just excluding Riley, who everyone likes.

I said that’s what I wanted, the vibe was weird with just one single person and I want to do more things with just the couples in our friend group so it’s less awkward. My gf got super pissed and snapped at me that nobody else thinks it’s awkward and we’re not leaving Riley out *just* bc she’s not in a relationship. It turned into an argument between my gf and I and she told me that I could just not come if I had such a problem with her being there.

I talked to some of the guys in our group about it expecting them to agree with me, but they all said they have no problem with her coming. One of them even said him and his girlfriend (Riley’s best friend) sometimes go out to dinner with them and Riley and it’s “not weird at all.”

AITA for allowing my BOYFRIEND to ground my kid?

I \[33M, bisex\] have an 8yo from a previous marriage. We were married for 5 years, and we have our son at the last year of our marriage, that's when she \[33F\] changed; she started neglecting our child and she became a party girl, going so far as getting into drugs. After a few months of trying to fix everything, I left and got full custody. That was 7 years ago.

About 5 years now, I started dating a guy; he\[27M\] and my children get along pretty well. My kiddo understands he is my bf, and he calls him Uncle ""Jim"". He is like his confident, friend, and when my son is upset, he likes to talk to him. My bf moved in with us a year ago.

Well, my ex started to turn her life right about 2 years ago, and last year she got married and this year she gave birth to their new son. For the past two years, she has tried to reconnect with our son (she was absent all the time before). And now she is pretty much a good mother to him.

A few months ago, she asked me if she could have our son for a month or so, so he can bond with his brother. After consulting with our son and his therapist, I agreed, but on condition it was going to be after midterm.

She got my son last week, and yesterday I got a call from her saying that my son told her that my BF sometimes grounds him when he doesn't do his homework or when he doesn't behave at school (my bf usually is the one getting him at school, he WFH).

She got really really mad, started screaming and telling me that he has not the right to ground him since we are not married. I told her that first she knows in our country same sex marriage is not legal and second, he has been in my son’s life more time than her and I allowed him to ground my son until a few months ago, after he moved in with us, also he has never punished him far than that. Is just grounding without tv or videogames, or he has to do some chores when he doesn’t want to do his homework, that usually makes my son rather choosing the HW than the chores.

She kept yelling and calling me an asshole for allowing any other guy to punish our son. She kept saying a lot of stuffs. Her family started to reach out to me to complain too, and my parents (whom I don't have a good relationship with bc I'm bi) also joined the complaint.

I have sent everyone to fuck themselves, but it has started to bothering me if I was in the wrong by allowing my BF ground my kid.

7,1ek95gg,AITA? I Pushed My Friend Over the Edge.,"I’m sharing text messages between my friend and I because I could not post images of our conversation. I had just gotten out of an abusive relationship of 5 years and was told by my friend the day before to call him anytime for any reason. 

Me: I was calling to hear your voice and hear about your day.
Friend: On the phone with my boss and about to get loaded.

Me: Okay.

A few hours later….
 
Me: If I stressed you out yesterday I’m sorry that was not my intention. Usually if I’m feeling down or something else is wrong I try not to unload all of my emotions of sadness on you as I know you have other things in your life and you need to focus on you. I’ve been doing other things like exercising and putting my focus other places today, but still need to talk to someone I’m close to.

Friend: I know what you’re doing and I don’t like it. It’s trying to use my own emotions to manipulate me into giving you what you want… me on the phone. Whether you realize it or not that’s what you’re doing it’s pissing me off. I am busy on top of that. I don’t feel like having to explain to somebody that I don’t feel like talking to anyone right now. You’re right I do have a lot to deal with. For the record I’m cool, not angry but I don’t feel like talking. The only thing that I am irritated about is that I actually had to explain to you that I don’t feel like talking to not only to you, but to anybody I just want to be left alone today and I should never have to explain to anyone that I’m 42 year old man I pay my own damn bills and my mothers and I don’t owe anybody an explanation about whether or not I feel like talking on the phone. Stop feeling all butt hurt because I definitely still love you. I just need a little space sometimes I need a lot of space does not mean that I don’t like you or don’t love you or trust and believe I love you. 

Me: I think you may have read that wrong I see that you are busy and sometimes cannot get back to me, but now you are making me feel like my life does not matter to you.  

Friend: You may not be able to recognize your own passive aggressive nature, but I do also we’re not having a conversation right now I’m putting my phone down.

Friend: I’m not reading your messages because I know you’re picking a fight and I’m staying in a peaceful frame of mind. If you do manage to make me angry enough to retaliate I’m going to wreck your f-ing day and that’s not what I want to do so you best leave me the f alone right now.

Me: Right now I’m going through something and the fact that you’re being selfish is what I’m talking about I really need help and need to talk to someone but you’re so focused on yourself. Good night.

",Asshole,2024-08-04,"AITA? I Pushed My Friend Over the Edge. I’m sharing text messages between my friend and I because I could not post images of our conversation. I had just gotten out of an abusive relationship of 5 years and was told by my friend the day before to call him anytime for any reason. 

Me: I was calling to hear your voice and hear about your day.
Friend: On the phone with my boss and about to get loaded.

Me: Okay.

A few hours later….
 
Me: If I stressed you out yesterday I’m sorry that was not my intention. Usually if I’m feeling down or something else is wrong I try not to unload all of my emotions of sadness on you as I know you have other things in your life and you need to focus on you. I’ve been doing other things like exercising and putting my focus other places today, but still need to talk to someone I’m close to.

Friend: I know what you’re doing and I don’t like it. It’s trying to use my own emotions to manipulate me into giving you what you want… me on the phone. Whether you realize it or not that’s what you’re doing it’s pissing me off. I am busy on top of that. I don’t feel like having to explain to somebody that I don’t feel like talking to anyone right now. You’re right I do have a lot to deal with. For the record I’m cool, not angry but I don’t feel like talking. The only thing that I am irritated about is that I actually had to explain to you that I don’t feel like talking to not only to you, but to anybody I just want to be left alone today and I should never have to explain to anyone that I’m 42 year old man I pay my own damn bills and my mothers and I don’t owe anybody an explanation about whether or not I feel like talking on the phone. Stop feeling all butt hurt because I definitely still love you. I just need a little space sometimes I need a lot of space does not mean that I don’t like you or don’t love you or trust and believe I love you. 

Me: I think you may have read that wrong I see that you are busy and sometimes cannot get back to me, but now you are making me feel like my life does not matter to you.  

Friend: You may not be able to recognize your own passive aggressive nature, but I do also we’re not having a conversation right now I’m putting my phone down.

Me: I’m not trying to say anything bad, but If one of my friends is in a dark place I sit and listen no matter how I feel.

11,1ek8pil,AITA for telling my sister I won’t help her anymore with dating & to grow up and talk to him?,"My sister, Anita, is 21 and has never been in a relationship before and she’s upset about it. She has high standards, which is great, but it’s also made things harder on her. If she likes someone, they don’t like her back and vice vera. But yeah, she has complained to me a few times and I do want to help her out and find love or a relationship. 

She had a crush on one of my friends, but he was in a relationship until now. He’s single, but a lot of girls have been trying to get with him, including my sisters friend and her roommate. He’s tall, attractive, etc. You get it, haha. He can basically date anyone he wants and he’s really charismatic on top of it. I think he’d be a great pick for her.

She asked me to talk to him since we’re close friends and I told her that I would, I want to help her find a relationship and true love.

So yeah, I told him when we were hanging out that my sister is interested in him asked how he felt about that. He said she was really sweet and beautiful and he’d love to take her out sometime. He said the next time they hung out he would talk to her, so our conversation was a success.

But it bombed. She has a hard time talking to guys she likes and was super standoffish and awkward. He ended up telling me that I was wrong and she doesn’t have feelings for him and he’s not going to bother trying anymore. I told him that was fair, but she is interested, she’s just bad at talking to guys she likes but I understand.

My sister has been begged me to go talk to him again and try to see if I can convince him to talk to her and ask her out. She said he gave up too easy, and she was nervous.

I told her that I meddled enough, but she blew it. I said she should go talk to him and explain she was shy and tell him how she feels herself. She can even ask him out herself, like her friends and roommate have been doing.

She did not love this idea. She said he’s the man and he should approach her. She just kept saying that over and over again. ""He's the man, he should come to me.""

I honestly rolled my eyes at her. I told her it’s not the 1800’s, she can approach him and ask him out and it’ll be fine. 

She said I was being the asshole and a terrible brother because I promised to help her. I told her I did my part, I tried to help. Either way, she is really upset at me. She told me that her roommate would date him and it would be “all my fault.”

Fast forward to a week later and I get a text from, let’s call her Kaitlyn, asking if I have an issue with her because she wasn’t invited. I hadn’t seen her in a couple of months and the last time I did, I paid for her entrance fee to a club and she left 10 minutes later. I never spoke to her since then and it wasn’t all that expensive but I did think it was weird (I would have Venmoed or offered to Venmo in return). Overall that was small potatoes and while there was no issue, I don’t feel a closeness with this person. I explained that I invited those I felt close with and she flew off the handle. Mind you, she didn’t know it was my birthday until two days after the actual day when our mutual posted on instagram. She never wished me happy birthday anyway, saying it was because she wasn’t invited but again, my actual birthday was two days before she got wind of any events/invites. Regardless, she called me immature and negative after I explained to her multiple times that this was not personal and I did not set out to hurt her with my birthday plans. She said basing my invitees on who failed that particular exam was “weird,” which was very insulting given how that affected all of our lives.

15,1ek7q11,AITA for not listening to other people during D&D games? ,"I recently just started playing Dungeons and Dragons and learned about meta gaming. For anyone who doesn’t know, and to my best understanding, meta gaming is basically making personal choices based on information your character wouldn’t *actually* know. 

For example, If someone in your party had something happen to them while your character wasn’t around, but you as a player hear the story unfold through the other player and the dungeon master, you can’t make decisions with your character based off of that information. That would be meta gaming.

Anyway- long story short, in order for me to not meta game, I simple don’t listen to anyone at the table when my character isn’t in the scene. It’s not that I don’t care, but it’s easier for me to not meta game when I literally don’t know anything. Whenever the dungeon master is doing his thing of course I tune in, but otherwise, I’m out. Sometimes I scroll my phone but most of the time I’m reading up on my moves and character bc I don’t wanna make a fool of myself when it’s my turn since I’m playing with experienced people. 

Theres six of us all together, the DM and 5 players. Three people really have a problem. They say I’m being disrespectful and that I clearly only care about myself. Whenever I do anything in the narrative for my character, they make remarks like “make sense” basically calling me selfish or whatever else the situation calls for. 

In my opinion, the game has been better for me as far as the story goes bc I genuinely am making blind decisions. They disagree and say it’s about table etiquette. 

My DM and one other player don’t care either way and my DM says we should all be able to play the way that works for us, but their snarky comments or talking loud when it’s their turn and my character isn’t around is kinda getting to me.

Idk if it’s just me or if getting the hang of not meta gaming is difficult as hell. Maybe I’m just stupid lmao 

AITA for not listening as a way to avoid the problem? Or do I need to swallow it and just listen to everything? 

Additionally, would I be the a*hole if I asked my DM to write me out of the game? Being hounded is making the game less fun for me. They also keep making decisions that are basically ways to bully my character in the game like not picking up extra supplies for me or bringing back food or whatever and then playing it off as something else.

I’m the one that wanted to get the party together to begin with so I feel like quitting would make everyone feel like it was a waste of time and then they would be proven right in a way that I am selfish.

What do you think? PLZ HELP. 


Edit: omg lmao okay Jesus I get it!!! Stop being mean to me! IM JUST AN AUTISTIC BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

I just wanted everyone to have genuine authentic reactions to their stories and have things to reveal and for our time as a party to be a real time of role play and discovery but I realize that’s up to my DM to control that narrative in that way and the social aspect is more important than game mechanics. 

After reading the comment, I’ve asked to call another session zero soon to talk about everything.  

Will update if anyone wants.

AITA for not listening as a way to avoid the problem? Or do I need to swallow it and just listen to everything? 

Additionally, would I be the a*hole if I asked my DM to write me out of the game? Being hounded is making the game less fun for me. They also keep making decisions that are basically ways to bully my character in the game like not picking up extra supplies for me or bringing back food or whatever and then playing it off as something else.

I’m the one that wanted to get the party together to begin with so I feel like quitting would make everyone feel like it was a waste of time and then they would be proven right in a way that I am selfish.

What do you think? PLZ HELP. 


Edit: omg lmao okay Jesus I get it!!! Stop being mean to me! IM JUST AN AUTISTIC BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

I just wanted everyone to have genuine authentic reactions to their stories and have things to reveal and for our time as a party to be a real time of role play and discovery but I realize that’s up to my DM to control that narrative in that way and the social aspect is more important than game mechanics. 

After reading the comment, I’ve asked to call another session zero soon to talk about everything.  

Will update if anyone wants.

16,1ek7khl,AITA for missing my FILs 70th bday party to attend a football game with my mom and brother,"My mom, brother, and I typically travel to an out of town football game every year as part of our family tradition. We have watched football together for around 30 years. In 2022 they got into a huge fight and ended up going to counseling to try and reconcile. They have recently started being amicable again and my brother agreed to go to a football game with us to restart the tradition. This will be a home game so we don't have to travel anywhere. This was planned in April and tickets purchased. 

Fast forward to Aug 1st when I get an email invitation from my MIL inviting me to my FILs 70th bday party on Aug 31st, the same day and time as the game. I texted my MIL to let me know and she was ok with it but my wife won't let it go. Both events are in about 3 weeks but she has been bringing it up a lot more as we get closer. I do go to about 5 games a year but my brother will only be going to this one. I  feel like we already had plans plus it is something that will bring my mom and brother closer together again.  I'll be traveling to my in laws that weekend but leaving from there to go to the game so I will be able to see them, just not at the party.

17,1ek7cn9,AITA for not inviting my friends?,"| (F15) and my two friends Alvin (M16) and Simon
(M15) are struggling because our other two friends, Theodore (M15) and Eleanor (F16) are mad at us because we hung out today without them 

For some context, Theodore and Eleanor have been dating for awhile. The five of us somewhat recently became a friend group. At first it was all of us except for Simon and Alvin, and we were already close before they were apart of our friend group. When they became apart of it, the five of us would all hang out together often. A lot of these hang outs were spontaneous and not planned much time in advance. This is important to the story. Recently, Theodore got a job and works almost every single day, and Eleanor moved about 45 minutes away. So naturally, this stopped us from hanging out as much as we used to. Me and Simon became closer friends, and we would start to hang out 1 on 1.

These hangouts would also be spontaneous.
Theodore caught on to us hanging out a lot and got upset with me because he thought we were leaving the rest of the friend group out. I felt bad and could see where he was coming from, but I explained how we weren't intentionally leaving the others out and we were purely just bored and wanted to hang out with each other. This happened numerous times after, and I would give him the same answer. I asked Eleanor about how she felt about it, and she told me she didn't care if we hung out. I should also mention that Simon would hang out with Alvin way more than he would with me, but from what I know, Theodore didn't seemed to care about that. The problem soon went from me and Simon hanging out, to me Simon and Alvin hanging out without Theodore and Eleanore. Alvin and Simon started to invite me to their hangouts and Theodore would tell me about how he felt left out. I would give him the same response.

Today, I was invited to hang out with Alvin and Simon, and I decided to invite Theodore this time.
He then got upset because he felt as if he was ""the last option"" and I tried explaining to him with that logic I should also feel upset and left out since I was also invited last second. All of this happened within the span of an hour, and it isn't like they were hanging out without us before they decided to invite anyone. He told Eleanor about what was going on and she got upset with us for not inviting her either.

I can understand where they're coming from, but despite always feeling left out or lonely, it almost always is me Simon and Alvin asking to hang out.
Any time either of us does in our group chat, it either gets ignored or nothing really happens. When things do seem like they're going to actually happen, one of the two cancels, and then none of us hang out. We went from hanging out all the time to rarely seeing each other. We've hung out as a aroup twice in the past two month. and both of those had to be scheduled weeks in advance. We tried calling him and our conversation went no where. Are we in the wrong?

19,1ek6v7d,AITA for not going to dinner at my in-laws? ,"I might be the asshole for setting this boundary with my in-laws. 

My fiance (22M) and I (21F) currently live in one of my in-laws rental properties about a quarter mile walk from their own home. When we moved out of their home to this property, they said they would like to do dinner once a week. The problem is that they want to do dinner on the weekends. We both work full time jobs and have a side job we do for a half a day on Saturday or sunday. Because of working and commute time we only have time to do chores and grocery shopping on the weekends. 

For context, we both wake up at 5:15ish, I leave for work at 5:45, he leaves for work at 7:30 and we don't get home until 5:30, have to make dinner, take care of our cats (which he does in the mornings before work) and do other daily chores like the dishes and laundry. We normally go to bed around 9. On the weekends, we have to do our second job, grocery shop, do nail clips for the cats (11F and 5moF), meal prep for the week (Breakfast and Lunches), vacuum the house, mop, bathrooms, change litter boxes, check oil and we like to do a date night Saturday nights. When we lived with them, we would do family dinners on Sundays. My fiance's younger brother (20M) would routinely not show up to these claiming to be busy with other things. The other issue is that the dinners can be anywhere from 3-7. 

My in-laws do not plan things well. They will tell us about dinner plans the day of, do not tell us when dinner will be and expect us to drop everything when they text us that dinner is ready. We have asked them to let us know at least two days ahead of time to let us know what day and time dinner will be. They have not done this so we have not been going to dinner because we have been busy and have assumed there are no plans because they have not given us warning. While we could have assumed that there would be dinners on Sundays, we have told them that weekends don't work for us because it is our only time to do most things. This is our first time setting a boundary with them and my FIL called my fiance earlier today when we told them we couldn't make it to the dinner we didn't know about til this morning and was incredibly mad we haven't been to dinner even though they have not given us a heads up for about three weeks since we first set this boundary. 

We have been spending more time with my family, which could be part of the problem of them being angry with us, but my family asks us to do things at least four days in advance and has never thrown a hissy fit about us not being able to make it to their events. They also live a half an hour drive away and we do not have time to go see them during the week days while we can easily walk a few minutes to see my in laws.

I told my LS I dont think its a good idea and that our OS would not find it to be sweet and an honor it would hurt her even more. We argued about it and she said that Im being dramatic.


Even though I know it was supposed to be a surprise, I knew my older sister would be even more depressed than she already is if our LS named her son after her deceased son so I went against my LS wishes and told my OS. As I expected she was PISSED. She said it was incredibly disgusting and selfish to do that knowing how fresh it is for her and that she does not want to see a baby with her sons name in the family which I agreed with.

23,1ek5g16,AITA for ignoring my father's requests for money to buy his stepkids birthday gifts?,"I'm (21m) estranged from my father. The relationship is complicated, our estrangement started to build when I was 13 and became an official estrangement when I turned 15 and in court I was given the choice not to go to his house anymore. For people who need to know, he burdened me with things he was keeping from my mom, with bad choices he made, and with a secret that was always going to cause a lot of trouble. He put the weight of our family's happiness on my shoulders until I broke. My mom's anger was more because of what he did to me than the stuff he did to her.

Not long after I stopped going to see dad he got married and he became a stepfather to three kids. Not sure of the ages but it's twin girls and a boy.

My younger siblings 16f and 14m still go to my father's house. Their relationship with him is still okay. Not as bad as ours is but not good by any means. But he didn't fuck them up like he did me either.

Anyway, a few months ago my mom fell on some hard times and my siblings birthdays are 4 weeks apart so I gave her some money for gifts for them. I wanted to help her out.

One of my siblings mentioned it to our father and when he and his wife ended up short to get the twins the gifts they wanted for their birthday coming up, he reached out to me on social media to ask, since I have him blocked on my phone.

I ignored him. He asked again. I ignored him again. I ended up blocking him when he tried again.

He caught me going to moms after work the other day and he asked me why I was so unwilling to help ""my other siblings"" when I helped mom with my actual siblings birthday gifts. I ignored him more and went inside but he waited until I was leaving to go home and he followed after me. He asked again and I told him because I don't give a fuck about his wife's children. They are nothing to me. And I do not feel any urge to help him make their birthdays special. I then told him to leave me alone. He yelled after me that I didn't need to take my hatred of him out on innocent kids. And that he knew I could afford to and he would have paid me back unlike my mom. I yelled back that mom did pay me back, I just hadn't expected or wanted her to.

He ended up stealing my brother's phone the next time they were at his house and sent me a bunch of texts about my selfishness and coldness.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-04,"AITA for ignoring my father's requests for money to buy his stepkids birthday gifts? I'm (21m) estranged from my father. The relationship is complicated, our estrangement started to build when I was 13 and became an official estrangement when I turned 15 and in court I was given the choice not to go to his house anymore. For people who need to know, he burdened me with things he was keeping from my mom, with bad choices he made, and with a secret that was always going to cause a lot of trouble. He put the weight of our family's happiness on my shoulders until I broke. My mom's anger was more because of what he did to me than the stuff he did to her.

Not long after I stopped going to see dad he got married and he became a stepfather to three kids. Not sure of the ages but it's twin girls and a boy.

My younger siblings 16f and 14m still go to my father's house. Their relationship with him is still okay. Not as bad as ours is but not good by any means. But he didn't fuck them up like he did me either.

29,1ek4gi9,AITA for not supporting my husband's fan fiction?,"My husband has been dedicating a lot of time to a fan fiction project he's working on. On the surface, I have no issue with this. Fan fiction isn't really my jam, but we all get to have hobbies that fulfill and engage us.

However, there are a few extenuating circumstances around this project that are eroding my ability to be supportive and mirror his enthusiasm.

1. Conflict with other priorities: A few months ago, my husband and I agreed that we would be making a long-distance move in order to be close to family again. Step one is him finding a new job, but he’s barely tried. I feel salty that he made this huge commitment and then immediately ran from it into a new and time-consuming hobby.
2. The unrealistic expectations around the fan fiction itself: My husband intends to turn what he has written (probably a 50 or so page synopsis) into a screenplay that he is convinced will turn out to be about 300 pages. Here's the kicker: I work in the film industry. I know firsthand that a 300-page screenplay based on IP that the writer doesn't even own is dead on arrival. Like deader than dead. He claims he's aware of this too, but he still simultaneously harbors a fantasy that somehow, some way \*his\* script will be good enough to get made. I truly don't understand why doesn't just turn what he's got into some short stories and post it on Wattpad or elsewhere. 
3. General escapism: He's openly unhappy with his life and says that writing the fan fiction is one of the only things making him happy these days. He especially despises his job, even though he only works 12-18 hours per week. So the fact that he has this constant stream of life complaints but isn't trying to actually address any of them, and instead is burrowing deep inside a fantasy world of his own creation is... unsettling, to say the least.

Basically, fan fiction is all he wants to talk about, and, more importantly, it's all he wants to do. I feel so fucking let down, and I finally lost it on him last night when he commented proudly ""I can't believe I wrote a 300 page screenplay in just a few months!"" All I could think was a) no you absolutely did not, you wrote a synopsis, b) a 300 page screenplay is a failure in my line of work, not an achievement, and c) all of that came at the expense of our shared commitments to one another. So I scoffed, he demanded an explanation for why I'm so negative/defensive about this thing, and I told him:

\*It's not real. It has no future, certainly not the future that you're losing yourself in. Stop asking me to treat it like it's real. Stop prioritizing it over work, bills, moving, building a life that you actually like. For the love of god, please treat this hobby like a hobby and stop making it the center of our shared universe.\*

And you know what, on some level, I do think saying that makes me an asshole to some degree. But when I step back and look at the bigger picture, I can't help but wonder what the hell else I'm supposed to say or do?

I truly don't understand why doesn't just turn what he's got into some short stories and post it on Wattpad or elsewhere. 
3. General escapism: He's openly unhappy with his life and says that writing the fan fiction is one of the only things making him happy these days. He especially despises his job, even though he only works 12-18 hours per week. So the fact that he has this constant stream of life complaints but isn't trying to actually address any of them, and instead is burrowing deep inside a fantasy world of his own creation is... unsettling, to say the least.

Basically, fan fiction is all he wants to talk about, and, more importantly, it's all he wants to do. I feel so fucking let down, and I finally lost it on him last night when he commented proudly ""I can't believe I wrote a 300 page screenplay in just a few months!"" All I could think was a) no you absolutely did not, you wrote a synopsis, b) a 300 page screenplay is a failure in my line of work, not an achievement, and c) all of that came at the expense of our shared commitments to one another. So I scoffed, he demanded an explanation for why I'm so negative/defensive about this thing, and I told him:

\*It's not real. It has no future, certainly not the future that you're losing yourself in. Stop asking me to treat it like it's real. Stop prioritizing it over work, bills, moving, building a life that you actually like. For the love of god, please treat this hobby like a hobby and stop making it the center of our shared universe.\*

And you know what, on some level, I do think saying that makes me an asshole to some degree. But when I step back and look at the bigger picture, I can't help but wonder what the hell else I'm supposed to say or do?

31,1ek43qp,AITA for not traveling to see my friend? ,"I live about 8hrs south of my friend. About a week ago she messaged me asking if she and her sister could come visit in a few weekends. My friend doesn't have a car, but her cousin had offered to drive them down to visit me. I was super excited. My husband is in the military and we are moving at the end of next month even further away, so it was the perfect time for them to come visit.

Unfortunately, she messaged me this weekend telling me she wasn't able to get as many days off work as she had requested and asked if I could meet her in her cousins city instead, which is about a 4 hr drive each way for me.

The last month has been incredibly busy for me. I've spent half the month traveling to see family and go house hunting. I am a big home body and so the travel has been very exhausting for me. Additionally, I am very stressed about our move coming up, there is a lot that needs to be done to prepare. Them coming to visit seemed manageable, but the thought of having to travel for another weekend was very stressful to me. 

I sent a message telling her that this is just not a good time for me to be traveling, and that I was so sorry because I was very excited to see her. I offered to cover her flight if she wanted to come see us when we are settled after our move. 

She hasn't responded since I sent that message, and I am starting to worry that maybe I should have just sucked it up and told her I would meet her there.

However, I have made effort to see her in the past. Just in May I drove the 16hr round trip in three days to see her senior year capstone performance. Also when I lived only an hour away from her, with an exception of my wedding, I was always the one to travel to see her. Which was totally fine because I had a car and her only mode of getting to me was train. I'm not saying I minded any of this, I am saying that I have anyways been willing to make the effort in the past.

One of the first things I did after moving was joining the local rugby club this also turned into being one of my best decisions.

Like I'm not angry at her I love her to bits and she's my best friend and I'd never say anything about it to her because at the end of the day if she'd be annoyed by me playing with her theres no point in me doing it. Really I just wanna know what y'all think of the situation and if I'm rational to be upset, hurt etc constructive criticism appreciated

In short does me being really annoyed and upset make me the asshole in this situation?",4.0,1.0585359334945679,1,0
38,1ek1wf5,AITA for trying to limit the time GF spends with her parents/siblings/relatives because it negatively impacts her life?,"I (M35) am together with GF(32) - we are living together since 5 years. I have a full time job. GF has a part time job and is still working on her Bachelors degree which she hasnt completed in 8 years. The main reason for this is that she spends far too much time with her parents/sister/relatives. All of them live within a 5 Mile radius from us.

She calls her sister/parents every day and speaks 30 Minutes+ with each of them. On top of that she visits her sister/parents/relatives like 5-10x a month. Each time half a day or entire day. As a result she barely gets anything done. A Bachelor degree she should have completed in 4 years tops is only 2/3 done after 8 years.

Our appartment is quite dirty because she doesnt clean much - because she has to spend so much time talking/visiting her relatives. I clean myself but since I have a full time job and a family further away which I visit once a month - I cant do it all by myself.

Im afraid for her future - and told her that she should reduce the number of visits to save time she could invest into finishing her education - and getting a full time job. I told her that seeing her sister/parents twice a month and her more distant relatives once every two months is still enough and it would free her like a week of extra time every month. She talks to them every day for half an hour anyways.

She freaked out and treated me like an abuser that wants to control her life.

39,1ek1tkf,AITA for withholding information from my mother about my medical appointments,"Quick note: Keep in mind that English is not my first language (I'm sorry if it's difficult to understand my post). 



Background: I (F 29) still live with my parents because I am currently finishing my PhD this year. When I started it, my parents said that it would be better for me, to stay with them to save all the money, so that I can use it at a later date (maybe to do a postdoc, or just when I decide to move out). The problem is, that my parents do not treat me as a 29-year-old woman. They expect me to do everything they say, and they always talk about how I should ''respect'' them because they are my parents. However, when I ask that they should also respect me, they say that I don't deserve it because I'm the daughter (my brother and I have been called useless, stupid, and they criticise everything we do). So, I decided to start going to a psychologist, in order to help me cope with my low steem, but I didn't to tell my parents about that.



So now I've been struggling with all the stress and all of my bad thoughts about myself. Also, my mother is behaving like a hawk criticising everything  Because of this and all of the fights at my house, I've had some anxiety episodes. My psychologist recommended two options: either leave home or take antidepressants.



Although I have not yet made a final decision, I am starting to look at flats to move into, although it is not going to be easy.



After that I had decided to at least find out about antidepressants by visiting my GP during an appointment (keep in mind that my parents didn't know anything about this nor about my appointment). In the end, I didn't tell my GP anything about this because I had made the decision that I didn't want to take antidepressants. So, at that doctor's appointment I only told him about a minor problem I have, and he sent me for a blood test.



The next day, while I was at home with my mother, I happened to tell her that I had gone to the doctor about the minor problem (she did know about that problem) and that I had the blood test. At that point, she got very angry and started yelling at me, saying how come I didn't tell her about it. I replied that since it was nothing important, I forgot to mention it at the time. She yelled at me again saying that she knew I hadn't told her because I didn't want her to go to the doctor with me. She always expects to come with me for every single medical appointment, even though I'm a full grown woman.



To avoid the fight, I decided to just say sorry and I went to my room. A couple of minutes later, my brother told me that my mother was crying saying that I am a horrible person, that doesn't want to be with her parents, etc. My brother told me that it was fine setting boundaries but that I had gone too far.



Honestly, at that moment I did not agree with them, but now I'm having second thoughts, and I'm not sure if what I did was bad.

40,1ek1t3u,WIBTA for telling my sister that if let her be homeless than let her stay with me again?,"Title is harsh but please read the post. I 24F have a sister Ana 27F. Ana and I both came to the US via scholarship and all our friends and family were back home. Sign then, we both landed jobs in the US and live a state away.

Me and Ana were very close before, and last year she moved in with my after breaking up with her boyfriend. He was abusive, and I’d begged her to leave him or at least think about in the the past, and she left him briefly and went back a day or two later, but she only really listened after she ended up in hospital. 

I let her live with me if she promised to not contact or talk to him, and she agreed and said she wanted to put it all behind her. I gave her my card so she could pay for things herself, and when I got one of my bills back, I noticed that there was $7k that didn’t add up. 

I asked Ana about it and she got flustered when I said I would call my bank and say it was fraud and she confessed she gave her ex my card details and she didn’t realise he would spend so much. 

Paying off that bill wiped my savings and I had to sell some jewellery I inherited from our grandma, which I was really upset over. Ana promised she’d pay me back asap, but she had no savings and no job at the time.

We had a fight and Ana disappeared. I got a text from a friend that Ana was with her, and then I heard she got back with her ex. I was upset and didn’t try to contact her again after that.

Ana did pay me back in instalments, and she owes me $1k now. She reached out on text yesterday to say sorry for everything but she had finally changed and wanted to leave her ex, and she wanted me to give her a second chance.

She said all her friends were her ex’s and she didn’t know who else to ask. She wanted to move in with me and given our history I want to say no. I discussed this with my brother in my home country, and he told our parents and extended family who are calling me TA for turning my back on family.

43,1ek1d0n,AITA for ruining a potential relationship for my high school enemy?,"
I’m 20F and a senior in college. My high school days were relatively mundane. I wasn’t popular by any definition of the word, but I tend to make friends with extroverts. I’m an introvert, and I need people to drag me to things or else I will become a hermit. So, my friends usually had way more friends than I did and tended to get mixed up in drama. I was usually a spectator since no one knew who I was. I won’t lie, I sometimes enjoyed watching classic high school drama unfold. However, I drew the line when it comes to me or my friends. My main friend group was 5 girls (me, A, J, K, and one other). We all came from different circles and ended up forming an unlikely but close-knit group. Cue in Ally. A girl who seemed determined to fuck up all of my friendships individually. 

For starters, I want to mention that Ally was in the year above us. I always tell my younger family members this, and if anyone reading this is in high school, let me warn you. Never befriend upperclassmen who are only friends with lower classmen. If they have no friends in their grade, it’s for a reason. Ally was one of those, she was in the grade above us. I had quite a few run ins with her in high school. I will list 5 of them (among many) so you can get a feel for the kind of person Ally is/was.

1. She was obsessed with my friend A. She demanded to hang out with her everyday and often wanted A to set her up romantically with her friends. If A ever declined, Ally would throw a tantrum and do some nasty things to “punish” her. One of these instances included logging into A’s instagram account. Ally went into our friend group chat and found some mean messages A sent about some girl she was beefing with. A compared the girl’s face to the 🌜emoji. Is that shitty? Yes, but we were 16. Ally screenshots these messages and sent them to the girl. The girl went off on all of us who were in the chat, including me. 
2. I had a friend, N, in one of my classes. She had a big crush on this dude, S, who happened to have a crush on Ally. Ally and S went to homecoming together, where Ally personally told me she doesn’t like S at all and was leading him on for attention. One day N was venting to me about S and Ally, and I told N that Ally didn’t like S. Ally opened a group chat with me, N, and S. Ally and S absolutely cooked me in the chat, and N ended up dropping me as a friend. 
3. My friend J is very easily influenced. She comes from a bad home, was never taught how to deal with her emotions, and never had a role model to make good decisions. My friend group knew this and always tried to be a good influence on her. Ally took advantage of this and latched onto J. He dragged her to random, seedy, spots in the middle of the night, hanging out with creepy older men, and doing drugs. She ended up drunk driving with J in the car and got both of them arrested for trespassing. 
4. Ally was obsessed with J for some time. This was after her friendship with A had ended (went up in flames). So, she lied to J about A. She claimed that A was embarrassed to be friends with me and J because we were “science nerds” and not popular. She also claimed that A said that J is built like a fridge. I knew both Ally and A well enough to know that was not true. J, however, was very insecure about her body (Ally knew this) and believed her. It put a huge rift in our friend group for about a year.
5. None of Ally’s friends her age invited her her to homecoming. We felt bad since it was her senior year so we invited her to come with us. K’s family hosted us that night (driving us around, her dad took our pictures with a professional camera, etc.). Ally repeatedly instigated fights with our friend K. She kept making rude comments about K’s dad. She also called K a dumbass for accidentally spilling her at the restaurant. This was our last school dance together (covid) so my last school dance memories are just A being shitty the whole time. K was also against Ally joining our group in the first place, and was upset with us about it for some time.

Alright, fast forward a couple years. We’re in college. Ally and I end up attending the same school. Another guy from my high school also goes here. We’ll call him Cam. Cam was always very popular in high school, and for good reason. He was tall, played basketball, extremely charismatic, and conventionally attractive. He was also kind, and would talk to anyone and never came off as judgemental. I had a crush on him for the better part of 2 years, but was never really friends with him.

In college, Cam and I happened to reconnect through the mutual friend and actually became quite close. Cam was telling me that he met this girl at a party and was into her. He also told me she went to our high school. Out of curiosity, I ask him to show me the girl. She pulls up Ally’s instagram and I audibly gasp. He’s obviously interested in my reaction and won’t let up until I tell him how I know her. Once I started, I couldn’t stop. I talked about everything Ally did to me and my friends in high school and I didn’t hold back. I never explicitly told Cam to drop her, I just told him why I personally don’t like her and never reached out to her in college. My story definitely made Cam reframe the conversation he had with Ally and he began to see her as creepy rather than endearing. He decided not to pursue anything with her and ghosted her on social media. 

Now, I have no idea how this got back to Ally. My guess is that Cam told his friends that Ally is crazy and word got around. Maybe Ally knew Cam and I were friends and just assumed that him ghosting had to do with me. I have no clue. I ended up meeting Ally at the bar. First time we’ve spoken since high school. She was very drunk and unfiltered. Basically she told me to get over myself, move on from high school, and that I’m pathetic for still bringing up old shit. She asked why I’m still “obsessed” with her, which I think is crazy considering her past. She called me jealous and bitter and said that, quote, my “slickback looks like shit” (look up slickback bun if you’re confused). I thought that little bit was kinda funny. I called her a dumb bitch and walked away. Honestly, I was terrified because I have social anxiety and a fear of confrontation. 

I told a few friends about it expecting to have a laugh but they actually told me it may be my fault. They said people change after high school and I had no right to disclose her past to Cam and sabotage them. They told me I’m being possessive over Cam and should let him to make his own decision. They know about my past crush on Cam and I think that’s why they’re saying this. But I don’t like him anymore. Yes, I think he has a pretty face but in reality he can be kind of emotionally insensitive. Like a respectful fuckboy? I’m not romantically attracted to his personality. I don’t hang out with him that often, usually just after class. I am not flirty at all and am actually quite awkward around men (my family is full of women and I never had guy friends before college). Also, he had a thing with one of my friends and I would never break girl code. They think I’m still crushing on him, always teasing me whenever they catch me and him alone together.

Maybe Ally knew Cam and I were friends and just assumed that him ghosting had to do with me. I have no clue. I ended up meeting Ally at the bar. First time we’ve spoken since high school. She was very drunk and unfiltered. Basically she told me to get over myself, move on from high school, and that I’m pathetic for still bringing up old shit. She asked why I’m still “obsessed” with her, which I think is crazy considering her past. She called me jealous and bitter and said that, quote, my “slickback looks like shit” (look up slickback bun if you’re confused). I thought that little bit was kinda funny. I called her a dumb bitch and walked away. Honestly, I was terrified because I have social anxiety and a fear of confrontation. 

I told a few friends about it expecting to have a laugh but they actually told me it may be my fault. They said people change after high school and I had no right to disclose her past to Cam and sabotage them. They told me I’m being possessive over Cam and should let him to make his own decision. They know about my past crush on Cam and I think that’s why they’re saying this. But I don’t like him anymore. Yes, I think he has a pretty face but in reality he can be kind of emotionally insensitive. Like a respectful fuckboy? I’m not romantically attracted to his personality. I don’t hang out with him that often, usually just after class. I am not flirty at all and am actually quite awkward around men (my family is full of women and I never had guy friends before college). Also, he had a thing with one of my friends and I would never break girl code. They think I’m still crushing on him, always teasing me whenever they catch me and him alone together. 

So, am I these asshole? Should I have just kept shut about Ally and let things unfold organically? ",,0.30546334385871887,0,0
44,1ek1abo,AITA for not letting my son attend his girlfriend’s birthday?,"My son is 17, and his girlfriend (we’ll call her Jill), who he’s had since middle school, will be celebrating her 18th birthday soon. My son, Jill, and many friends they both have are huge into Japanese culture: sushi, anime, learning Japanese in school, etc. 

Hence, for her birthday, Jill is renting a room at a high-end sushi place. Jill’s parents will cover half the cost, but the guests are expected to cover the other half… $450! WHAT?!

This honestly took me aback. It’s obviously not that I don’t want my son to be there for his girlfriend’s birthday, but $450 is a large amount of money, and it’s as close to completely unaffordable as something could be. Am I old-fashioned for thinking invited guests in this manner shouldn’t be expected to pay at all? 

Long story short, my son became extremely upset when I told him I wouldn’t pay for him to attend Jill’s birthday party. Currently, my son is the only person invited, besides one other, yet to RSVP yes. I offered to let him take Jill out separately for an affordable dinner/experience I’d be willing to pay for fully, but he’s still upset with me. AITA?

45,1ek16kh,AITA for asking my roommate to buy me a new Nintendo switch,"I (32f) have lived with my roommate (30m) since March but we’ve been friends for a number of years. Background, my roommate has a lot more of a social life than I do and has people over constantly, which I really have no problem with since we both travel for a living and are gone for periods of time.

Here’s where it gets messy. On the 20th, I left for a few days and was only home a few hours between trips. Once I finally got home enough to relax, I noticed my Nintendo switch wasn’t in the dock. I went and looked in all the places, he or I would put it normally when he has people over and it’s not there either. For the last 2 weeks I’ve torn this apartment apart looking for it and it’s nowhere to be seen. If he put it somewhere, he has no clue where he put it (he’s also been looking for it). My concern is that one of his friends or people he has had over stole it but I have no way of proving that. 

I’ve been calm, saying that it will turn up eventually but the more I tear my apartment apart looking for it, the more I’m doubtful that it will. 

I’m going to look again while he’s gone so I can dig through his room (he knows this, I’m not just going to do it without his knowledge) because his worry is that he was *not in the right mind and he put it somewhere and just can’t remember where he put it. 

Would I be the asshole if I requested for him to replace it if I can’t find it? I feel like since he either put it somewhere when I was gone or that one of his friends possibly took it that he should be responsible for it, but I’m not sure if that’s just me being upset. 

*edit for more context*

The night he said he thinks it went missing he was high on coke. Which, I don’t care, live your best life. He said he’s worried he put it somewhere or did something with it when he was high and he can’t remember what he did with it or where he put it. That was the night he also had a ton of people over, which I trust his friends, some of them are my friends as well, but he can’t remember if he had anybody new over or who all was there.

At first she was laughing (edit: she said this when she saw us kiss the first time) with me telling me to enjoy the party and live my life. But around 2 am she started to get mad at me ? She yelled, slammed doors, called me names and told me that our friendship was over. I spent around 1 hour in the bathroom bawling my eyes out, and I could hear her calling me names through the door. I thought, ""She must be saying all of this because of the alcohol, tomorow she will be sober and we will be able to talk properly.""

She kicked the guy out around 3 am. And she kicked me out around 3.30, I had to call my mother in the middle of the night to pick me up, and I was still a bit tipsy.

Ava and I have been best friends since we were kids, I grew up poor and she was rich so she always made sure I ate and had a place to sleep– this girl is pretty much the reason I’m where I am currently. 

Even though I’ve got a job now, and try to offer to treat her she insists on paying and won’t let me pay her back. It’s her thing, I gave up trying and I’ve seen her do with our entire friend group so we just take it as a fun quirk of hers.

Cathy is pretty much the love of my life, I want to spend the rest of my life with her, so what I did was incredibly tough. The three of us and Ava’s boyfriend had gone out to eat. 

He had to leave early so didn’t pay (Ava said she was going to pay). Then, in true Ava fashion she went to the front desk under the pretext of going to washroom and paid the bill.

Obviously I tried my “let me pay you back, why’d you pay” things but she wouldn’t hear it.

Then, out of nowhere, my girlfriend accuses her of implying that she’s poor. Cathy said, “Listen I know you like to pay but I’m a fucking adult I don’t need you to pay for my meals like I’m a child.”

Ava seemed shocked and apologised. I was shocked too because Cathy doesn’t ever act like this and has always been fine with Ava paying.

I took her to the side and Cathy said “I don’t care if she’s your best friend she’s making me look pathetic.” She proceeded to insult her looks and her religion.

I got angry, because Ava was genuinely just a sweet person. I told her maybe she needed time to cool off, and walked out with Ava.

I called her an Uber and then drove back home myself. 

(Cathy has her own car so could take herself, she had not been drinking either)

When Cathy came home we fought because I “left with her”.

52,1ejyu0u,AITA for allowing my ex-wife into my home?,"Early yesterday evening my ex-wife came to pick up our son from my home. At the time my wife and I had a few visitors over for dinner. The visitors included her sister and husband, but was mostly friends. 

Usually my ex phones our son when she's downstairs (we live in an apartment building) and he goes down to meet her. Yesterday she called our son as usual, but asked him to ask me if she could come up because one of her younger kids needed to use the bathroom. 

I obviously said yes. She came up with her 3 younger kids. She didn't know we had company, so apologized for interrupting, before taking the kids to the bathroom. On her way out a couple of the guests stopped her for a quick chat (friends I've had since she and I were married) but it was only a few minutes. My son gave his little siblings some of the snacks that were out for guests.

After they left my wife's sister was quick to call my ex rude for barging in. One of my friends replied to her saying something about small kids bladders and nothing more was said about it.

Early yesterday evening my ex-wife came to pick up our son from my home. At the time my wife and I had a few visitors over for dinner. The visitors included her sister and husband, but was mostly friends. 

Usually my ex phones our son when she's downstairs (we live in an apartment building) and he goes down to meet her. Yesterday she called our son as usual, but asked him to ask me if she could come up because one of her younger kids needed to use the bathroom. 

I obviously said yes. She came up with her 3 younger kids. She didn't know we had company, so apologized for interrupting, before taking the kids to the bathroom. On her way out a couple of the guests stopped her for a quick chat (friends I've had since she and I were married) but it was only a few minutes. My son gave his little siblings some of the snacks that were out for guests.

After they left my wife's sister was quick to call my ex rude for barging in. One of my friends replied to her saying something about small kids bladders and nothing more was said about it.

53,1ejysut,AITA for giving my dad my headphones without telling him why,"Using a throw away account that I made by accident a while ago.

This is probably such a non issue but I feel bad about it. I'm 21M and autistic. A while ago I was on a road trip while my dad was driving. At one point he put on a podcast. I don't mind listening, but podcasts are hard for me to follow because of all the talking and get overwhelming, plus he's a bit deaf so he has the volume up high. I didn't want to force him to turn it off, so I tried everything to block it out, putting on my headphones, covering my ears, even putting my jacket on my head, unfortunately it didn't work. Finally I offered him my headphones instead, thinking this way he can use them to listen and I don't have to hear it. Instead he threw them back at me and turned the radio off, and seemed mad for the rest of the trip. I felt really bad about this because I never meant that he had to stop listening to his podcast.

Usually I'm very direct (my dad actually hates this) but this time I wasn't feeling good and didn't have an easy time speaking. The one time we met with the psychiatrist who diagnosed me, my dad was very supporting and spoke as though he does an amazing job and accomodates for me all the time, but in reality he usually only does things once or twice and stops. I have asked him to turn down the volume on the tv, etc, before, but he usually acts upset about it so I try not to ask too often anymore. However I was scared to embarrass him in front of the doctor, so I didn't say anything. It kind of bothered me that the doctor thinks we're doing great when we aren't so much though.

The reason I think I might be the asshole is because I know that it's passive aggressive to not say exactly what you mean, and I didn't say anything, just offered him the headphones. I definitely try not to expect people to read my mind. Whenever I ask my dad to adjust his behaviors, he acts put-upon like it's a big favor, so I'm worried that I'm being too demanding and not working hard enough to deal with my intolerances.

Edit: A lot of people are telling me it's not a good idea for drivers to wear headphones. I didn't know that, thanks for letting me know! As for my behaviors, I did exactly what I wrote, nothing more or less. I guess trying to muffle my hearing could be interpreted as passive aggressive, but I wasn't intentionally trying to communicate anything by it.

54,1ejyj2p,AITA because I want to go on vacation alone with one of my kids but don't allow my wife to do so?,"I (40 m) live with my wife (37 f) and our two children (4 f) and (3 m) in a large German city. I work full-time as a lawyer, that means in average 65h work per week. My wife works part-time (80%) as a teacher, that are effectively around 18-20h and some other work-duties on top per week. She primely takes care of the household and garden. Both children can stay in day care from 7 am to 5 pm but my wife picks them up early most of the time.

I am sacrificing that much to give my family a high standard of living (vacation, day trips and so on). Because of my demanding job, it is sometimes not possible for me to take vacation while my wife is on school vacations and the day care is closed. This has often led to conflicts because my wife would like to take the children on vacation for several days. I am against it. The reason is, due to my demanding job my time especially with my kids are extremely limited. For me it is always the best part of my day, when I can see my kids. And if she is going on vacation with the kids they would be away from me during this time.

Today I expressed the idea of going to vacation with one of our kids this September. I would only take one of the kids with me, because I can’t handle both on my own. The vacation would be outside the German school vacation period, because it is way cheaper. As my wife can't take a vacation outside the German school vacation period anyway, she could look after the other child. 

My wife was completely outraged by my suggestion and a big argument ensued. She claims it's not fair that I deny her the opportunity to go on vacation at all (not even alone, because she has to take care of the kids), while I take the right to go on vacation myself whenever I feel like it. I am surprised about her reaction, because she has +90% of the time with the kids and I in the best case maybe 10%. 

She suggested we put the matter on Reddit to find out who was right. So Reddit, am I the asshole?

She desperately wanted to go out clubbing, and when I arrived to her’s ( we live about two hours away ) I googled it and realised the clubs in her town are all closed ( her birthday unfortunately fell on a Monday). I suggested we go out with some friends to the nearest city ( 30 mins on the train ) and try and stay out all night, and get the train back at 5am. I know thats a mad plan, but it’s an 18th!! 

Alas, Sabrina agreed to ask - and asked her friend Amy. Amy is bringing her friend Coco, who Sabrina has never met ( Coco and Amy were primary school friends, and are both 18).  It turns out that Coco doesn’t have her ID ( she’s been travelling in europe so she didn’t get ID’D there apparently). Coco is staying at Amy’s house, and lives three hours away and she’d be home alone at Amy’s if we left her. Sabrina didn’t want to just go and sit in a pub like spoons or the local pubs, which is what Amy suggested because coco is less likely to get ID’d - so I suggested that we just ( unfortunately ) leave Coco behind and go out anyway. Sabrina has never met Coco and i felt it was unfair for her to ruin her 18th birthday because she forgot her ID. Sabrina eventually agreed, we went out and had a great night. 

Amy came along but felt bad about Coco the whole time, and when we came home she had an argument with Sabrina about the situation. She said Coco was really upset we left her behind and called us all selfish. I felt bad because we didn’t intend to leave her out, but Coco wasn’t originally invited to Sabrina’s birthday and it’s her own fault she forgot her ID.

60,1ejwfr2,AITA for hanging out with my friends distancing friend?,"I have never posted before so bare with me please.

I 32 (F) have a friend 36 (F) who honestly is upset with me because I went shopping with someone she was once / still kind of is friends with. Some background, let’s call my friend that is upset Lisa and the other person is question Donna.

Lisa and Donna have been friends for a few years and would even say best friends there for awhile. Lisa is getting married this year and Donna had a prior engagement so she will not be able to attend, at that point is when it all started going downhill. Keep in mind most of this is one sided as I got my information from Lisa. Since the unattending of the wedding moment Lisa has been very upset with the fact that she wouldn’t drop everything to be at the wedding and started to really talk bad on Donna. I don’t know their friendship like that but I was being fed that Donna was not inviting her to things, talking shit about her, distancing herself and choosing other people, etc etc. 

Meanwhile Lisa is still inviting her to things, bday parties, movies, even the bachelorette. I am trying to be as supportive as possible but for me if someone ain’t worthy of my friendship then they aren’t my friend anymore, period. So it was weird to still see them hang and have Donna come around. I am not as close with Donna but for the sake of this next part we have hung out together,l & she has been invited to my events.  I would consider us acquaint friends. 

Well this last Friday we were all at Lisa’s birthday dinner and Donna and I happened to be sitting next to each other.  Obviously we started talking as it would be awkward as shit if we didn’t and kind of just caught up. We are the more outgoing of the group so it’s easy for us to shoot the shit and have a good time. While we were there she mentioned she wanted to go shopping and I piped up that my week was rough and retail therapy is always a good answer. Nothing else was said but as we were leaving Donna asked if I wanted to meet her to go to a store and I said yes.
Come to this morning and I am somehow having a real discussion with Lisa about how I was “catching up like best friends” and “hangout 1 v 1” that it’s  contradictory of me since I have been at Lisa’s side. 

This is my honest take but this is why I am here because maybe I am missing something. For me, it was literally just letting off steam with someone I knew. It’s not like we are now bff or we are conspiring against Lisa. I am in my 30s, not middle school, so idk how I am feeling guilty for hanging out with another person.  Yes, they have been drifting apart but Donna keeps coming around and we are going to continue to see each other. It almost feels like instead Lisa is trying to control the friendship? But idk why.

Am I the asshole here? Maybe I needed to be more mindful of her feelings but it all feels so juvenile to me & honestly I am a bit tired of walking on eggshells. ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-04,"AITA for hanging out with my friends distancing friend? I have never posted before so bare with me please.

I 32 (F) have a friend 36 (F) who honestly is upset with me because I went shopping with someone she was once / still kind of is friends with. Some background, let’s call my friend that is upset Lisa and the other person is question Donna.

Lisa and Donna have been friends for a few years and would even say best friends there for awhile. Lisa is getting married this year and Donna had a prior engagement so she will not be able to attend, at that point is when it all started going downhill. Keep in mind most of this is one sided as I got my information from Lisa. Since the unattending of the wedding moment Lisa has been very upset with the fact that she wouldn’t drop everything to be at the wedding and started to really talk bad on Donna. I don’t know their friendship like that but I was being fed that Donna was not inviting her to things, talking shit about her, distancing herself and choosing other people, etc etc. 

Meanwhile Lisa is still inviting her to things, bday parties, movies, even the bachelorette. I am trying to be as supportive as possible but for me if someone ain’t worthy of my friendship then they aren’t my friend anymore, period. So it was weird to still see them hang and have Donna come around. I am not as close with Donna but for the sake of this next part we have hung out together,l & she has been invited to my events.  I would consider us acquaint friends. 

Well this last Friday we were all at Lisa’s birthday dinner and Donna and I happened to be sitting next to each other.  Obviously we started talking as it would be awkward as shit if we didn’t and kind of just caught up. We are the more outgoing of the group so it’s easy for us to shoot the shit and have a good time. While we were there she mentioned she wanted to go shopping and I piped up that my week was rough and retail therapy is always a good answer. Nothing else was said but as we were leaving Donna asked if I wanted to meet her to go to a store and I said yes.
Come to this morning and I am somehow having a real discussion with Lisa about how I was “catching up like best friends” and “hangout 1 v 1” that it’s  contradictory of me since I have been at Lisa’s side. 

This is my honest take but this is why I am here because maybe I am missing something. For me, it was literally just letting off steam with someone I knew. It’s not like we are now bff or we are conspiring against Lisa. I am in my 30s, not middle school, so idk how I am feeling guilty for hanging out with another person.  Yes, they have been drifting apart but Donna keeps coming around and we are going to continue to see each other. It almost feels like instead Lisa is trying to control the friendship? But idk why.

61,1ejvsge,WIBTA if I didn't include my friend in the wedding party?,"(Throw away account because the people mentioned use reddit)

I (24F) am getting married to my fiancé (26M). We have come an issue with the wedding party and are not sure what to do. So about 3 year ago, I rekindled a friendship with a primary school friend (We'll call her Jenny). Jenny and I have had a lot of clashing opinions about things, weddings being a big one. She wants a huge wedding that's over the top and to feel like a queen (she said she wants to be the center of attention on her day), whereas I would rather have a rustic, whimsical wedding that is simple and small. She has told me in the past that my wedding ideas are to plain for her and that she'll only accept dresses that are to her standard. She also insists on wearing extravagant makeup that she wears everyday which I'm afraid will upstage me as I like natural makeup. Though she is not well of by any means, she believes that the most important thing in life is spending money and feeling rich, which does tend to get irritating as she mentions it constantly. So as you can assume we aren't overly close, but we are both pretty close to another girl in our group (We'll call her Molly), I have asked Molly to be a Bridesmaid on my side but I'm not sure about Jenny. 



So far the wedding party is kind of perfect: on my side is my sister (the MOH), fiancé's sister and Molly, and on my fiancé's side is his childhood best friend (BM), fiancé's brother and Molly's partner. I don't want to leave Jenny out but I'm just closer with Molly (we have been best friends since we were 8 and are very close like siblings). I know Jenny would be upset about this but it's also my wedding day and I want to feel as comfortable and relaxed as possible, and I'm afraid Jenny will start arguments and make comments about how the wedding looks.

62,1ejva69,AITA for refusing to help my friend financially even though I can afford it?,"
TL;DR A friend asked me for $4.5K due to financial struggles, but I refused because my parents taught me financial responsibility, I worry it might strain our friendship, and I don’t feel responsible for her financial issues. She called me selfish and uncaring.


Context - I (20M) am a college student in the US, coming from a wealthy family overseas. Recently, a close friend S (20F) has been struggling financially as she had to pay unexpected medical bills for her family and has asked me for help.


She knows my family is well-off and assumed that it wouldn’t be a big deal for me to lend her some money (around $4500).


Here’s the thing - while I do have access to a considerable amount of money, I don’t feel comfortable giving away that much money. Growing up, I was taught the importance of financial responsibility. My family’s money is for my education and living expenses, and not for me to be giving it away.


Additionally, I am also worried about the potential impact on our friendship, as I’ve had similar situations ruin previous relationships. I don’t want her to feel jealous or pressured by the debt, especially if she has trouble pay it back (I don’t need her to - but she insists).


I also feel as it’s not my responsibility to bail her out. I feel bad for her situation, but I don’t think it’s fair for her to rely on me just because she knows I have the means.


Although I explained all this to her, she got very upset and called me selfish. She said “true friends” help each other in challenging times and that I am showing my “true colours” by refusing to help.

Both were widowed with children. Dad had me (10m then/26m now), my sister (8f then/24f now) and my other sister (7f then/23f now). Mary had Jess (9f then/25f now), her son (6m then/22m now) and her other daughter (4f then/20f now). 

Dad and Mary wanted to make a nuclear family and a more ""traditional"" family where Mary would stay at home, be the ""mom"" to all of us and dad would be ""dad"" to all of us and work and be the less involved in the day to day childcare parent. I never accepted Mary as my parent. I never called her mom. I resent her deeply for asking frequently when I was a child. Jess never accepted my dad either. She feels the same about him that I do about Mary. My sisters call Mary ""mama"" because they called our mom ""mom"". Jess' younger siblings just call dad ""dad"". Jess and I never considered us all a family. We both missed our late parents and would cause chaos by bringing them up sometimes to put the stepparent/parents spouse in their place and remind them that they weren't forgotten. I'd do this with dad too and I would remind him that my mom wasn't replaceable and her place in my life could never be filled by anyone else.

I am low contact with dad and Mary now.

Jess had a baby in the last two years. She named her daughter after her dad. This upset my dad and Mary. I found out about this a little over a month ago because my wife and I had a son and his name was my mom's middle name, which she was known as by close friends and family. Mary was ""hurt"" that I honored one grandmother over the other. My dad also told me I should have found some way to honor Mary. Maybe using her maiden name, etc. They have not met my son and I did not reach out to them. They reached out to me. They told me Jess doing the same was such an intentional snub against our family and them as parents. Mary told me I should have reached out to her and checked if my decision was okay with her, I should have included her and dad in this. Dad said the same. I pointed out they are hardly in my life anymore which is how I prefer it so I'd never include them. I ignored calls and texts for a few more weeks until Friday Mary told me this was not how someone treats their mother. I responded that she was never my mother, she was never my real mother, who died when I was still a child. I told her claiming she is was part of what made me so distant from them. They both decided to Facetime me that night and told me I made such a big and hurtful decision without discussing it with them, how Jess had done the same and they rambled on like that. I told them they're not entitled to a say in the decision making of adults even if they raised them. I told them Jess and I do not need their permission and clearly we don't care what they want.

We met in our first year of college and were friends with benefits for that year. In our second year, we got closer and started dating in September. Our friends thought we were the epitome of true love and friendship. However, he was insecure, which I ignored at first.

One night, he drunkenly called me, saying his friends believed girls never have just one guy and he felt he was just my favorite. This shocked me, and I asked him to call me when sober. He often slept over, and I loved it, but things changed during the summer break. He wanted me to be available on my phone 24/7, and when I missed a call, he freaked out. He started posting Andrew Tate content and eventually told me in January he lost feelings for me. We broke up, but it hurt.

In March, we reconnected and got back together. It was nice but filled with constant small fights, and he often wanted to break up. I always convinced him to stay. During the June holidays, I called him drunk and told him I was depressed. His response was dismissive, saying he was tired of hearing it. I asked for three days to work on myself. After the break, he told me he was better without me, blamed me for his academic failures, and said I was holding him back.

68,1ejs8x4,AITA for getting frustrated with my friend?,"Just want to get reddit's opinion, as my friend group is a bit split over this and a couple of people are irritated with me. Details are real, names are fake. Main conflict is between me (35M) and Haley (34F).

Context, my friend group has had a core of people for over a decade (we're all in our 30s and met at university), with some people joining and leaving over the years as is natural. One of the originals, Haley, got married around 4 years ago and is in the process of divorcing her ex. He's a dick, not a good father to their two children, and the divorce is fully warranted. She starting dating around 3 months after initiating the divorce, which I thought was a bit soon but hey, she's a grown woman and can do what she wants.

The guy she started dating - Andy - seemed nice enough. I thought she was moving fast with it, as he was moved in with her and her kids within about 4 months of them starting dating, but again I kept my mouth shut because her relationships aren't really my business. They've been together about a year now. Three months ago Andy had a serious family incident which gave him a lot of trauma and has not been dealing with that well. Excessive drinking, to the point he has twice pissed himself on their living room floor (and refused to clean it up, making Haley do it), walking over Haley, not helping look after the kids (after presenting himself as a father figure to them), and generally being a poor partner.

My frustration was starting to build, as Haley has a history with her ex and her family of allowing herself to be walked on, venting about it to friends and asking for help, improving for a short time, then falling back into those patterns. She's been excusing Andy, and sometimes hiding his more egregious behaviour, and it's been starting to feel like watching a car crash in slow motion. 

Things came to a head yesterday. Most of the friend group were out for a meal (for my birthday, actually, but that's not super relevant), about 10 of us including partners, and Haley - after a couple of drinks - started complaining about Andy, who wasn't there. She directly asked me what I thought of a specific thing he had done, and I said that he was clearly at fault and not being a good partner, but that I also thought she needed to look at her role in her relationships, get some therapy, and work on boundaries. She got angry about that and made a couple of personal comments, and I said ""What did you expect after moving in with the first guy you started dating when your divorce isn't even at mediation? Don't you think you set yourself up for this?""

I regret the tone of those words, because I never would have wanted to say them in anger.

Most people agree with the theme of what I said, but think I shouldn't have said it.

So, AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-04,"AITA for getting frustrated with my friend? Just want to get reddit's opinion, as my friend group is a bit split over this and a couple of people are irritated with me. Details are real, names are fake. Main conflict is between me (35M) and Haley (34F).

Context, my friend group has had a core of people for over a decade (we're all in our 30s and met at university), with some people joining and leaving over the years as is natural. One of the originals, Haley, got married around 4 years ago and is in the process of divorcing her ex. He's a dick, not a good father to their two children, and the divorce is fully warranted. She starting dating around 3 months after initiating the divorce, which I thought was a bit soon but hey, she's a grown woman and can do what she wants.

The guy she started dating - Andy - seemed nice enough. I thought she was moving fast with it, as he was moved in with her and her kids within about 4 months of them starting dating, but again I kept my mouth shut because her relationships aren't really my business. They've been together about a year now. Three months ago Andy had a serious family incident which gave him a lot of trauma and has not been dealing with that well. Excessive drinking, to the point he has twice pissed himself on their living room floor (and refused to clean it up, making Haley do it), walking over Haley, not helping look after the kids (after presenting himself as a father figure to them), and generally being a poor partner.

My frustration was starting to build, as Haley has a history with her ex and her family of allowing herself to be walked on, venting about it to friends and asking for help, improving for a short time, then falling back into those patterns. She's been excusing Andy, and sometimes hiding his more egregious behaviour, and it's been starting to feel like watching a car crash in slow motion. 

Things came to a head yesterday. Most of the friend group were out for a meal (for my birthday, actually, but that's not super relevant), about 10 of us including partners, and Haley - after a couple of drinks - started complaining about Andy, who wasn't there. She directly asked me what I thought of a specific thing he had done, and I said that he was clearly at fault and not being a good partner, but that I also thought she needed to look at her role in her relationships, get some therapy, and work on boundaries. She got angry about that and made a couple of personal comments, and I said ""What did you expect after moving in with the first guy you started dating when your divorce isn't even at mediation?

69,1ejrnji,AITAH for lashing back at my partner for calling me a gaslighter?,"We were at a performance, and the show was really boring. Midway through, I asked “do you want to leave” as I wasn’t interested in the performance anymore. He said “I am indifferent. I don’t mind staying or leaving.”

Quarter of an hour later, I asked “I do not want to stay anymore. Do you still want to watch?” Apparently he only caught the second half as the music was too loud, and his reply was the same. 

Another 15 mins later, I asked (according to him): “me: you want to leave? 
Him: I am indifferent. You decide.
Me: shall we leave?
Him: like I said, I’m indifferent. You choose.
Me: ok let’s go then”

Afterwards, I asked him how come he didnt catch hints that I wanted to go. If he caught the whiff that I didn’t want to stay and he is indifferent, we could just leave. He said I should have just been direct (which I did the second time, but not the first and apparently the third time), and proceeded to call me a gaslighter because gaslighters make others say things which they don’t want to say explicitly. He then compared me to another friend he hates, and how some of his close friends agree that such behaviours are typical of a gaslighter. I got upset and got into a fight and mood afterwards.

I admit that I probably should have been more direct, but my point of consideration was that I didn’t want him to feel compelled to leave if I said I want to leave directly. What if he wanted to stay but feel obliged to leave because I brought it up? It probably was unfortunate that the music was loud when I explicitly stated my intention the second time.

My parents agreed with letting Nancy and her daughter stay. Well during that time period my mom has changed a lot with her attitude towards my sister and I. At first it was just subtle things like responding to us with a bit more attitude. Now she just completely raises her voice at us for no particular reason. She also tends to ignore us and hang out with Nancy more than with us like she used to. Recently there was this incident with a cousin of mine that lives with us (completely different from Nancy she pays her portion of rent and brings stuff to the house) my cousin had brought some cases of water bottles and my cousin just happened to make a comment like “aren’t the water bottles only supposed to be for when we go work?” The comment wasn’t even supposed to even be directed to Nancy but she somehow managed to snitch on my cousin and told my mom. My mom got pissed and she told my cousin off. I tried to explain my side of the story since I was there and witnessed it. Soon my sister started getting tired of all this and confronted my mom and her behavior. My mom just laughed in her face and told her to not be so sentimental and to get over it.

76,1ejpgen,AITA for trying to reconnect with my former friend group?,"Throwaway because my friends use reddit and I don't want them to see this.

I (19M) attend a university with a very close-knit class of exchange/foreign students. We're such a small batch that practically everyone knows everyone, and that naturally leads to us forming groups amongst one another. I had one such group that formed sometime at the beginning of November last year, and it was a mix of male and female students all roughly the same age.

I found myself becoming attracted to one of the girls in the group, but I didn't want to put her in a bad spot, so I tried to slowly work my way up to her inner circle of people she was close to. She's pretty introverted and socially awkward (due to her upbringing, she implies), like a porcupine. So, over the last several months, I've been trying to be more open and caring toward her, to show her that she can trust me. I try to start deep conversations with her, sharing my insecurities, I offer her my umbrella on rainy days, etc. She wasn't reciprocating my feelings, but we were still close friends, so I thought everything was fine.

Apparently it wasn't, because the next thing I knew, the other people in the group singled me out and accused me of being 'creepy' and 'overbearing' towards her. I admit I may have gone a bit overboard sometimes, and I got frustrated and panicked and did some really stupid things that even I admit look *really* wrong, but I don't think it warranted me getting kicked out of the group afterward. I spiraled into a dark place pretty bad afterward, to the point where people had to intervene before something serious happened, so I got therapy and started treating myself for conditions I realize now were coloring a lot of my thinking and relationships.

A month after the initial confrontation, I thought enough time had passed that I could try getting back into the good graces of the friend group. I even had the support of a couple of people in the group, so I thought things would be fine. However, when I tried to join back, the girl and the two people she was close to practically told me to shove off and leave them alone. I tried explaining that I was seeing a therapist and was getting better, even recommending it to them, but they reacted poorly and distanced themselves again. I also overheard them talking about me sometimes, and how it's 'too soon' and how I'm 'pushing boundaries again', but I don't see what I did wrong.

Throwaway because my friends use reddit and I don't want them to see this.

I (19M) attend a university with a very close-knit class of exchange/foreign students. We're such a small batch that practically everyone knows everyone, and that naturally leads to us forming groups amongst one another. I had one such group that formed sometime at the beginning of November last year, and it was a mix of male and female students all roughly the same age.

I found myself becoming attracted to one of the girls in the group, but I didn't want to put her in a bad spot, so I tried to slowly work my way up to her inner circle of people she was close to. She's pretty introverted and socially awkward (due to her upbringing, she implies), like a porcupine.

For context it's a place wewere supposed to go to we already went to and I know that I don't like it and I've made it clear that I don't like the place. Also they argue alot with each other and against me so I'm just not capable of dealing with that anymore since I'm a full-time nursing student and I only have that one vacation a year were I'd like to relax just a little bit. 

Resulting out of that argument on Friday I now am sort of disowned and am forced to pay half the rent every month or move out.

78,1ejp8sw,AITAH FOR LEAVING THE ROOM AND IGNORING MY SISTER AFTER SHE CALLED ME A LIAR,"I (F 19) have a sister (32 F) and we are close but not SUPER close, we respect each other and the age gap makes it to where we don't argue much. I work the same job as her and we carpool together and I pay half the gas money. I have offered multiple times to pay half the insurance too, but she flat out refused. 

Anyway, it was a super minor thing, my brother (17 M) had put something in the dishwasher that wasn't supposed to go there and said I told him to do it. My brother is a known liar, he lies all the time. I told her I didn't, because I didn't, and she looked me in the eye like I was 6 years old  and said, and I quote, ""did you blank? I won't be mad if you did, just tell me okay?"" 

This infuriated me, she has done this before and I had enough. I let it happen before and I was done. I looked at her and said "" no, blank, I didn't"" I knew I was getting mad so I started to leave before I yelled, and as I was leaving she said ""I just can usually tell when blank (our brother) is lying."" And I replied ""that's great"" and went to my room. I didn't speak to her the rest of the day, or the day after that, which is today. 

But today I did tell her I would pay for her broken hubcap, seeing how I was driving when it broke. It went like this:

Me: I'll pay for the hubcap
Her: no I can 
Me: I'll pay for it
Her: no I can pay for it
Me: I said I'll pay for it
Her: I don't blame you, I'll pay for it
Me: I never said you did. I'm paying 
Then I left

Later my mum came to be and told me to stop being a bitch and stop being mean to my sister, I told her the only thing I had even said to her was I was gonna pay for the hubcap, my mum said ""then say it nicer"" and to apologize to my sister. 

I'm not going to apologize for being upset that she treats me like a 6 year old with their hand caught in the cookie jar. I have never in my life accused her of anything or treated her without respect, I always split money equally and just 2 days ago I bought her an expensive ass birthday present and  baked her lemon cakes! And she just insults me?! And I apologize?! It's not even the fact that it was about something so small, it's the fact that she respects me so little when I've only ever given her an insane amount of respect, the amount I give to my PARENTS. I've never even raised my voice at her. 

She acts holy and perfect but treats people around her like they are slum and beneath her and I'm tired of it. If she wants a relationship with me she will have to respect me, not treat me like a 6 year old liar, and then cry about it to our mom when I show that I'm upset about it.

79,1ejos7m,AITA for what I said to my brother after he was a dick to me?,"I (24F) am living at home for the summer until school starts back up in two weeks. It’s already been a long summer with the fighting between my mom and I, but it got worse tonight after my brother (22M) showed up unexpectedly. My brother moved back in with my dad to stay with him until he started training for his new job. Idk what happened, but he packed all his stuff in the middle of the night last week and drove back to my mom’s (literally west coast to east coast). He didn’t tell anyone he was leaving and didn’t ask my mom if he could come back until he was already on the road. So she had no other choice but to say yes.

After a couple of days he got here today. Everyone was happy to see him, and I was too, but I am mad at him over a few things (another story for another time). He had to take the bonus room since I’m still in the guest room (again, unexpected visit). He got all his stuff up there, brought his dog and cat in, and then told me he was going to lay down upstairs. He told his dog to behave, then went upstairs and “laid down” (he was actually setting up his gaming pc), leaving me to deal with his dog. 

I have nothing against his dog. He’s sweet and very playful, but also very energetic. He was wanting to play and jump around with/on my mom’s two dogs, and they weren’t having it so it was a lot of barking. I was watching my other brother (8M) for the night while my mom and stepdad went out. We were trying to watch a movie and we couldn’t even do that because of the dogs barking. I kept yelling at his dog to stop and he wasn’t listening. My brother (22M) comes downstairs and leaves without saying anything. I ask where he went and he replies “can I not go to the store for 5 mins?”. He came back either fast food so clearly he didn’t go there. I was pissed that he was just leaving his dog for me to deal with while I was clearly watching our brother.

My brother (22M) went back upstairs (w/o his dog) while I was still dealing with all of them. I kept yelling at his dog, and then my brother comes downstairs and tells me to stop yelling at him and “treating him like a mutt” (ironic because he’s yelled at and called his dog a mutt when he misbehaves). I got mad and told him maybe he should, idk, take care of his own fucking dog and not expect me to do it. We got into it, and it ended with him taking his dog upstairs (and acting pissy about it) and him calling me a bitch. I told my mom and she didn’t say anything except to stop fighting.

 I texted him a few hours ago telling him to please not call me that again and if he’d like we can switch places to where he can watch our brother and try to deal with three dogs and two cats that hate being around each other while I go “lay down”. He read it and didn’t respond. I feel kinda bad about my response, but I felt like it was warranted. He’s been saying he’s so tired from driving for 4 days, but imo he made that choice himself and it’s not like my dad kicked him out. So, AITA?

This isn’t an exciting AITA but I still would like input. Throwaway for a variety of reasons. I(23F) am in a group of friends that are close, we all are in a club. There is M(24F), C(21M), T(22M), and L(21F). We’ve been super close, despite M friend-zoning C last April, and M being super affectionate towards C when she gets lonely. 
This year, J(22M) joined our club, and joined the friend group in April. J is conventionally attractive but awkward, and M privately told me that she wanted to be his first kiss in May. I didn’t say anything, and regret it. 
M and J got together on July 4th & I found out the next week. They asked me not to tell anyone to keep the friend group normal. So I did. M is moving to TX next week, so J and M could theoretically get away with dating without people figuring it out.
Yesterday they asked me to help me lie to C so they could hang out with us but still get alone time. And I did, but my bf says that I should tell the truth. I don’t love lying, but it’s not my secret to tell. I think it could hurt C, since M friend-zoned him, but it was a long time ago. It feels like a Kant situation but I would  love anyone’s opinion. Feel free to ask for more details, though I imagine this is a little boring.

Clearly showing my age by jumping the gun and writing this entire post out only to end up talking with her about it right after but I’ve realized that there was a lot more to it than just this situation and we were able to unpack it all! Thank you for all the advice regardless though, I was very reassured and surprised! by how many people were sympathetic to a friendship that I felt I had completely ruined.

Going to sound like the asshole here so honestly just need advice from people who arent friends on what would be best to do from here on.

I (18F) and my friend (17F) have been super close for the past two years. She gets sick pretty often (as do I, so its not something I hold against her) and we’ve had to cancel a big hangout we were planning with our friend group (6 people) because of it. I know its not her fault and I was sarcastically joking around about how she should try to get better soon, but she didn’t take it well and has given me the cold shoulder for the past week or so (before that she was really sick so she wasnt texting a lot). 

I checked up on her maybe twice or so this week (we typically text every day but again, sick) and I thought she was still really sick so I tried to give her some space. Turns out she actually left our group chat (no message was sent so I didnt know) and shes basically fed up with me. 

To defend myself a bit, I’ve been taking care of my dog recovering from surgery and also have a bunch of issues with college coming up so I havent really been texting any of my friends besides finalizing preexisting plans. Maybe I was being delusional but I truly thought we were fine and she just needed more time because she was super dry when I checked in on her, but Im realizing now that the way I was talking to her made it seem more like I was interrogating her than genuinely worried. I’m typically pretty sarcastic with my friends (who did say that the messages I sent didnt seem unordinary in tone) but looking back I do think I shouldve realized that my jokes werent landing because she was hurt that I didnt seem to care about her, not because she was sick and needed space. 

At this point she’s expressed to our other friends that she doesnt want to talk to me anymore- I sent her one final message saying I wanted to apologize face to face if she’d be comfortable with it but I dont expect her to respond and wouldnt blame her if she didn’t check. 

Sorry this is so long (and if there are any mistakes in my writing).

I’m typically pretty sarcastic with my friends (who did say that the messages I sent didnt seem unordinary in tone) but looking back I do think I shouldve realized that my jokes werent landing because she was hurt that I didnt seem to care about her, not because she was sick and needed space. 

At this point she’s expressed to our other friends that she doesnt want to talk to me anymore- I sent her one final message saying I wanted to apologize face to face if she’d be comfortable with it but I dont expect her to respond and wouldnt blame her if she didn’t check. 

Sorry this is so long (and if there are any mistakes in my writing). I guess at this point I know I was the asshole but I really cared about this friendship and want to see if anyone thinks theres something specific and severe that  I need to work on to avoid making a similar mistake in the future.",0.0,1.0670146942138672,1,0
83,1ejnu9a,AITA for not telling my *former* best friend i had a crush on her partner?,"this whole thing happened a few months ago. the dust has now settled but i wonder if i did the right thing. my(F34) best friend (BF) and i met 10 years ago. after a fall-out 2-3 years ago, we were on decent terms but out of touch. she did reach out though one day to tell me she met someone. i met her partner (P) a few months prior at mutual friends parties. they were nice but we weren't in contact before they met BF. BF, P, mutual friends and i ended up hanging. P and i grew closer and, since BF worked a lot, started hanging out one-on-one. i had a feeling that P was a bit flirty, but since BF have a flirtatious personality, i figured P had one too. at some point, i realized i started to have feelings for P. i worked on myself and eventually came to terms with keeping P as a platonic friend. 

fast foward to the beginning of this year, i said something stupid one night that BF, P and i were hanging. to BF, P and i got into a «massive» fight as we weren't talking anymore because of that thing i said. a few days later, P and i addressed the situation. they ended up hinting at the fact that they had feelings for me. we both later confirmed it was mutual. i thought that meant that we would distance ourselves from one another, but they freaked out to the idea, saying they didn't want to lose me. i remained firm and, though it was hard, we didn't see each other for 3-4 months. they texted me once but i asked them not to.

this last spring, a friend wanted us both to attend her birthday party. P and i met to discuss. i have to admit, i was missing our friendship a lot and was hoping we could mend it. things were pretty much at the same point for them. we hanged for a few hours and they had some sort of panic attack when we had to part ways. 

1-2 months later, they asked to hang again. i had a shitty feeling but agreed. that night, they shared intense things that made me uncomfortable. when i mentioned a crush, P said it made them sad. they placed me in the middle of their situation with BF and sobbed over the idea of marrying her (they proposed a few months after they started dating but kept it mostly private). P didn't tell BF about us meeting that night. i didn't either since we weren't in touch at that point. they told her the next day and she reacted badly. i don't know what happened exactly but that's when i decided to officially cut contact with P.

BF tends to prioritizes her relationships to the point of neglecting her friendships. that's the main reason why i decided to step back and not interfere, figuring she'd be happier that way. this situation took a huge toll on my mental health, i felt like the single messy friend causing so much drama. but looking back, i wonder if i should have told BF everything or if avoiding interference was the right choice. i know ive been a shitty friend but i still/will forever want what's best for her. did i make the right decision? thanks for reading!",Asshole,2024-08-04,"AITA for not telling my *former* best friend i had a crush on her partner? this whole thing happened a few months ago. the dust has now settled but i wonder if i did the right thing. my(F34) best friend (BF) and i met 10 years ago. after a fall-out 2-3 years ago, we were on decent terms but out of touch. she did reach out though one day to tell me she met someone. i met her partner (P) a few months prior at mutual friends parties. they were nice but we weren't in contact before they met BF.

85,1ejn7ol,AITA for blowing up at my sister for not visiting/communicating with our mom who almost died from a heart attack?,"Question in the title. My (28f) older sister (30f) is awful about treasuring family. My mom (58f) this past weekend had a STEMI heart attack. I have 4 sisters I am the middle child. I was there with my mom everyday at the hospital and have been the only child to help my mom acclimate to her new life post HA. 

Background. my mom buys my sister lunch nearly everyday, bought my sister her expensive wedding dress for her wedding this fall, and is always there when my sister needs to vent about stuff. My mom always gives her great advice. My mom bought my sister and her fiance tickets to see Foo Fighters last year worth hundreds of dollars. My sister was suppose to pay her back but refuses. I’m not as patient as my mom is with my sister.My sister and her never had a bad relationship. 

This week has been difficult to say the least. I am grieving my mom, thank god she is still with us, but her mortality was never something I thought I had to worry about so soon. I am very very close with her. I have been taking massive care with her because I love her and id really do anything for my family. I have been doing research, I’ve probably spent hours and hours in total this past week alone going to the grocery store to read labels and carefully pick out meal plans for her. I also been taking care of my two younger sisters who need help because they have autism. I haven’t really been sleeping or eating during this whole week. I think just having family there as support even if I’m doing it all would help. It’s the mental health that’s really the suffering part for me. 


But here’s why I’m asking if I’m the crazy one: My older sister hasn’t texted, called, or visited my mom even though she lives about 3 minutes away. I live about 40 minutes away and have been either sleeping at my mom’s to make sure she doesn’t have an episode in her sleep, or driving everyday first thing in the morning to ensure she’s ok. The other day my mom woke up with super high BP and fainted, and we had to call paramedics. My sister still didn’t speak to her until I coerced her to call. 

My sister is currently working 2 jobs, but that’s by choice. She is saving up for her wedding, but her best friend is a manager at one job, and honestly I feel like it’s fair of a work place to let her have even 1-2 days off to be there for my mom. AND her fiance is a fucking realtor for christs sake. I personally took a week off work because my mom means more to me than anything, and 2 days off or even a phone call would mean everything to my mom. 


I’m perfectly ok taking care of my mom. But my mom needs and deserve to know her children love and care for her during this recovery process. 
I have been begging my sister to come visit. She had one day off and chose to get her wedding dress fitted and idk what else with her day. 


I finally snapped at her And told her it was ridiculous and evil that she doesn’t even call or act like she cares.  

She got mad at me and told me I put pressure on myself to care for her because I “volunteered” to help our mom. I just see her values as being incredibly skewed.

87,1ejmxo5,WIBTA if I dropped from being MoH at my friend's wedding?,"So this is something I've been feeling conflicted about for a few weeks now and want some outside opinions.

My friend (19f) has recently got engaged and asked me (19f) to be her MoH. Now, we've known each other for about 3-4 years now and she knows I don't do dresses. So when she asked, she told me it was fine that I didn't wear a dress and that she just wanted me there with her. I immediately agree as I'm honored she chose me (and also the reassurance of not wearing a dress).

Few weeks passed, and we talked about outfits for the bridesmaids. We brought up what the plan was for me and planned on dress pants and shoes with a long sleeved button-up shirt and vest, possibly a tie too. I was ecstatic about it as I felt like that was a very ""me"" outfit and it was a look I've been wanting to try out for awhile but never had a reason to buy. She agreed and that was that.

Today I suddenly got a text from her about the wedding outfit. She restated that she didn't care what I wore to the wedding, but her parents (more so her mom from what it seemed like?) really wanted everyone (bridesmaids) to wear dresses. She says it's really important to her mom and that she wants to respect her mom's wishes and would love to find a dress I would be comfortable wearing.

I impulsively and reluctantly agree out of guilt but then text her asking if I could think on it for a bit. She says ofc and we go about our day. I ended up talking to her later in person to explain why I don't like to wear dresses. I didn't want to try to give excuses, rather to give my perspective and how I feel. She understands and never really wanted to ask me to wear a dress. She did it out of pressure from parents since they're funding the wedding. I told her that if it is really that important to her parents that the MoH is in a dress then I'll step down if I cannot bring myself to wear a dress (which will probably happen). She says she understands and will talk to her parents about it. I get a message later saying it's set in stone.

I feel guilty if I were to step down over not wearing a dress, but I don't want to try and be someone who I'm not at her wedding. My brother recently got married and I got forced into a romper since that was the compromise I had with him and hated every second in it. I don't want to repeat that feeling.

88,1ejmuoa,AITA for asking my adult son and wife to pay rent.,"Let me start by giving a little backstory. I was a stay-at-home mom for many years, and due to religion trapping me in a terrible marriage,I had 8 children and 25+ years of hell. Most are grown now, and only two are teenagers. I went back to school, and I spent the last few years dealing with PTSD from being a Covid ICU nurse. That trauma was the last straw; I'm leaving the church, setting boundaries, and asking for a divorce. Right now, I am spending all my effort on getting my ducks in a row and working towards getting to a place financially to make that happen. In the meantime, to put it lightly, there is an uneasy truce, separate bedrooms, and keeping my opinions closed. All of this is to say that although I gave everything I had, I spent all my time in survival mode and wish I could have had that stability so I could have been the mom I always wanted to be.

Because of this, I have gone through years of therapy, including trauma therapy for PTSD, read countless books, and tried my best to listen when my children complain about their traumatic childhood. I have apologized for spanking them because studies now show that it is not a grey area and is detrimental to children. I have tried to explain why I chose what I did at the time that I did it, but I also apologized for hurting them because although it was not my intention, it still hurt them.I financially supported my adult children because I hoped they would save money. Eventually, they would leave the nest and because this economy has sucked.

One of my married sons prefers my soon-to-be ex's avoidance of confrontation and has leaned to siding with my husband in this divorce (by the way, I didn't ask them to choose sides, but he has, and he let them know we were getting a divorce without me, etc.) has just suddenly stopped taking my calls and so has his wife. Due to a previous conflict earlier this year, adult children were asked to contribute to the electrical bill, $200 a month, and spend 16 hours in service around the farm in lieu of rent. When I tried texting about getting items back from my son, he didn't respond. When someone went over to ask for the items, he brought them over, and despite trying to talk to him, he walked by like I wasn't even there.

Did we argue some point? Nope. Was I a jerk about something? I have no clue. I have no clue what the hell is going on. So this is where I have to ask if I am being an asshole. If a friend I was letting stay with me out of the kindness of my heart started treating me this way, I would ask them to leave. So, after talking to my STB ex, who doesn't want to ask them to go, I thought it would be fair to ask them for the fair market value of staying in the poolhouse for rent.

I tried explaining him I didn’t intend it to seem like I was ungrateful, I just assumed it would’ve been food and I don’t see an extension cord as a “surprise” but he’s set on the fact I’m “ungrateful” 
He wants me to admit I’m ungrateful and bc I refuse to say I’m ungrateful we’ve been arguing for about 4-5hrs

90,1ejmr1x,AITA for keeping a cat around that causes undue stress on my wife?,"Two years ago, my wife pushed really hard to get a furry animal for her birthday. She wanted a dog but we live in an apartment and are away for most of the day so we compromised on a cat, which my wife has never had. I want to stress that I did not want us to get a furry animal, out of a fear of their lifetime bills, but accept that in a marriage you sometimes have to compromise. We decided to adopt a senior cat that was very sweet. She loves attention and playing, and has a very funny personality.

Now this cat has some issues. She was involved in a house fire that burned most of her ears off and caused damage to her nasal passages. As a result she sneezes a lot, with full on boogers streaks, and looks a bit off all the time. The boogers thing upsets my wife, so I try to clean it when I notice it, but it happens pretty regularly, and I don’t always catch it immediately since i’m not always around. This cat is also a bit messy and can sometimes track a bit of poop out of her box. I want to stress that this is rare, but it’s probably happened six or so times in the last two years we’ve had her.  I clean it up whenever I realize it has happened. 

Now the big one. She hisses at my wife. Not all the time though. She will beg for treats from my wife, ask for pets from my wife, and even lies next to my wife. It’s only when my wife is holding something in her hand and walking around. It’s a super odd tick, and she’s never scratched or bit anyone in fear, but this really upsets my wife. Tonight one hiss “ruined” my wife’s night and she decided to go to bed early despite being in an amazing mood before it. 

I’m stuck because my wife is at her breaking point. She works long hours and feels like she can’t relax in our apartment because of the cat. She wants to give her back to an animal rescue.  However, in a bizarre twist of irony, that cat is my best buddy. She warmed up to me, trusts me, and runs up to me when I come home. I’d go so far as to say she is my favorite pet I have ever owned. 

My wife wants her gone, but I think she’ll die there if we give her to a rescue. She’s old and not the most pleasant to look at. The thought of our cat suffering her last days out in fear and loneliness makes me legitimately want to cry. I’m caught in the middle. 

Tonight we got into a fight about the whole thing as my wife is giving me an ultimatum. The cat or her. I told her I’d do more research than I’ve already done and see if I can resolve these behavioral issues but, again, my wife feels like I am not validating her feelings by not taking the cat somewhere else. I’ve tried offering to do everything for the cat (I do for the most part anyway) but my wife says she can’t relax with her around and that she’s got to go.

When I was ten, my mom and dad had told me that once I was fourteen and could afford to get them, I could get piercings. Since then, I have planned out multiple piercings I'd like to get, and would bring them up multiple times throughout the four years I waited, my mom had eventually told me that she didn't like certain piercings, and I was fine with that and went through many different ones with her so she could approve of what I wanted. 

Now that I am old enough, and have over three hundred dollars saved, I went up to my parents hoping to make an appointment. My dad seemed perfectly fine with the idea, but my mom told me that if I wanted something I could get a secondary ear piercing, but if I wanted anything more I'd have to wait until eighteen.

the next day i expressed to him my discomfort with the entire situation, and told him i was wanted to tell his mom. that regardless of how mature, or how big he may seem, his brother is still a child. in a previous conversation i had mentioned how his brother should not be attending our friend get togethers, because its not an appropriate environment for someone his age. i mentioned this again, and that we were supposed to be the trusted adults. we failed his little brother. 

his response was to tell me that i was a snitch, and that its none of my business. “worry about your family.” i reaffirmed that i was going to tell his mom if he didn’t to which he began to beg. i told him i was willing to make a deal. i was going tell his older sister(27F) about what happened and she could do what she wanted with the information. if she decided to tell his mother, than so be it. also, his little brother was no longer going to be attending get togethers. if he truly wants to take his brother, then i am not attending. i will not be held accountable for his actions. he agreed.

fast forward to tonight, its been about a week. my boyfriend and i are planning to go hang at his friends place, and i get a text mid day asking if his little brother can come. i asked if he was being serious, and that this was not what we agreed on. he started pleading and i told him he could take him, but i wasn’t going. he just said ok. this has all rubbed me the wrong way, and i’m very upset. i dont want to go to his birthday event tomorrow, because of how bad im irked.

99,1ejk776,AITA for refusing to pay my ex $180 for a tattoo she got me?,"
Now ex-girlfriend and I went to Chicago in May, and both decided that we wanted to get tattoos while we were there.

 I was paying for all the dinners on the vacation, so I asked her if she’d be okay with paying for the tattoos since she had always been pretty fair with splitting expenses, and she said yeah. They wound up being $160 for hers and $180 for mine after tips. I asked her if that was still okay despite it being a little more than we expected and told her that I’d give her some money towards them if she’d like, but she said that it was fine.

Fast forward a month, and we broke up. We’re in the middle of no contact, and I saw her out on a social event one night with her friends while I was standing in line for an attraction. Once she’d noticed I was there she came over with her friends positioned right next to to me in what seemed to a move to make their presence known. I walked away and continued my night. Same evening, she sends me a random CashApp at 3:30 in the morning captioned “for the tattoo I paid for 🫶”. I assumed she was probably drunk and having drunk person logic on the ex contacting thing and was not really in the mood it so I wrote out a quick cordial message for my friend to send her asking to refrain from doing those things, she reads it, bing bang boom, back to no contact we chillin.

One day goes by fine, but the day after I was sitting at the library reading when I got a random text from her mom asking me to kindly accept the CashApp for the tattoo she’d send the night prior. Like I said, I didn’t even think it was a real request in that she’d actually think I’d accept it, but apparently she did.

I explained to her mom that I viewed the tattoo as a gift, and if that every gift we exchanged was expected to reimbursed,  then that was just silly.

She disagreed and said I should’ve brought more money and paid for the tattoo myself knowing how expensive they are, and that it was immature that I was refusing to pay the money to her daughter for it.

I explained to her again that I would’ve paid or contributed to it in the moment if I was asked, but I didn’t see the need to be paying for something that was offered was bought a month ago and wouldn’t have had to be paid back if we stayed together. 

She again said it was immature, but I just said whatever and backed off the conversation.

",Not the A-hole,2024-08-04,"AITA for refusing to pay my ex $180 for a tattoo she got me? 
Now ex-girlfriend and I went to Chicago in May, and both decided that we wanted to get tattoos while we were there.

 I was paying for all the dinners on the vacation, so I asked her if she’d be okay with paying for the tattoos since she had always been pretty fair with splitting expenses, and she said yeah. They wound up being $160 for hers and $180 for mine after tips. I asked her if that was still okay despite it being a little more than we expected and told her that I’d give her some money towards them if she’d like, but she said that it was fine.

Fast forward a month, and we broke up. We’re in the middle of no contact, and I saw her out on a social event one night with her friends while I was standing in line for an attraction. Once she’d noticed I was there she came over with her friends positioned right next to to me in what seemed to a move to make their presence known. I walked away and continued my night. Same evening, she sends me a random CashApp at 3:30 in the morning captioned “for the tattoo I paid for 🫶”. I assumed she was probably drunk and having drunk person logic on the ex contacting thing and was not really in the mood it so I wrote out a quick cordial message for my friend to send her asking to refrain from doing those things, she reads it, bing bang boom, back to no contact we chillin.

One day goes by fine, but the day after I was sitting at the library reading when I got a random text from her mom asking me to kindly accept the CashApp for the tattoo she’d send the night prior. Like I said, I didn’t even think it was a real request in that she’d actually think I’d accept it, but apparently she did.

100,1ejk5ly,AITA for not letting the mother of my bfs other child touch my baby,"Long story we’ve been together for 7 years rocky relationship but the mother of his other child has always had an issue with me. She always talked smack about me loudly on the phone with him so I could hear. I’ve always been there for her daughter as much as I could. I love her like my own, I have never talked badly about her mother at all. I honestly have too busy of a life to focus on her. In the past I read messages on my bfs phone from her talking really badly about me. She was angry when she found out I was pregnant and said “whats next marriage ???” She called me a crazy psycho bitch because I asked if my bf could stay home the week I was due ( his daughter had a soccer tournament that she wanted him to drive her to). The messages I saw actually hurt me because growing up I had shitty step parents that weren’t there for me and I’m the opposite with her daughter. I’ve never had any issue with her mother and I don’t even speak about her to my bf. 
Now on to the question, my bfs dad passed away and the first day the family all went to see his mother. The baby mom came to drop off her daughter and I said hi to her. She ignored me didn’t even look at me and just greeted everyone else. Okay I thought I’m not going to cause any issue because there are bigger things we’re dealing with today. It was awkward she stayed and didn’t speak. After she left everything was all good the daughter gave me a hug and we went on with the day.

 Fast forward to today ( 4 days after seeing her) I was holding my baby she walks in again walks right past me doesn’t acknowledge me at all and tries to squeeze my sons face saying loudly “Hi “baby’s name” I politely asked her not to touch his face. Then she gets argumentative with me yelling don’t ever touch my daughter then. I told her she needs to acknowledge me if she wants to meet my son. She walked out of the house and yelled “Bye “baby’s name” while glaring at me. There is clearly some issue she has with me but we are supposed to be focused on grieving right now I thought it was hurtful that she didn’t  put her emotions to the side and acknowledge me.  

 Anyways the day went on my bf told me to just be the bigger person and not cause issues. Later on her daughter wanted to come to our house so my bf went to drop us off and go back to be with his mother. His daughter didn’t have an overnight bag so he texted the mom and she said she’s not aloud to stay at our house because of me. Obviously this upset him and he’s already stressed he got upset with me. But am I really the asshole here for not letting her touch my son when all throughout these 7 years she’s talked so badly about me. 
* just adding this in I don’t let strangers touch my child so I thought at least it would be respectful for her to talk or say hello to me first. 
Also she is 8 years older than me I think maybe that has to do with some of the anger she has.

101,1ejjy7w,AITA for instigating an uncomfortable conversation with my friend?,"I have this friend (M20). We have feelings for each other but we're not in a relationship (due to personal trauma surrounding relationships on both ends) (this is relevant)

Me and this friend had a phone conversation earlier tonight. We got onto the topic of relationships and he talked to me about how he's always struggled with the idea of being in a relationship for his own reasons. I already knew this about him, but then a seed of thought came into my head. The only reason i know this friend has a thing for me is because he made a move on me (this was just under a year ago). I asked him if he's known for a long time that he couldn't cope with a relationship, why did he act on his feelings for me in the first place? I made sure to be respectful in the way that i asked, but he didn't know how to answer and the tone of the conversation shifted. It was a little uncomfortable for the rest of the phone call. 

Just want to put it out there that i did apologise if the question sounded blunt or made him uncomfortable. My intent wasn't to make things weird, from my perspective i was just trying to understand his intentions. But now I'm sat here wondering if the question i asked was reasonable or not. The last thing i want to do is say anything that will make things weird between us, because i genuinely care about him. But I'm not sure what to think about the interaction or whether i should've done things differently.

So when I told her I was going to quit Med school after a Bipolar disorder diagnostic and burn out she supported me a lot.
I had everything for starting my new career except for a co-debtor for my student loan and as the kind person she is, she volunteers and ask me to move with her at the beginning of the semester.

HERE COMES THE POINT…
 
The first day that I arrived the apartment was filthy, tbh it looked like one of those house from Hoaders in discovery, I told her about it and she just said she’s in a bad place right now.
Bc I know cleaning is important for mental health,  cleaned the whole house and told her to help me to keep it clean and in just 2 days the house was like the beginning, her girlfriend doesn't help either.

Their room is so messy that they are sleeping in the living room bc the amount of trash and dirty clothes they have.
So I can't sit anywhere to spend the day, just the “my room”Her girlfriend use all the closet and shelves in my room so there is no space for me, plus i don’t have privacy bc she just come in to search stuff all the time (living the room messy again)

The worse part is the kitchen, there is no a single place to put anything on the fridge bc of their candy and soda diets, the buy tons of it, and all the pans, plates, spoons, etc. all dirty, ALWAYS

They have 3 cats, and don’t clean the litter box that often so the smell is awful, i try to help them from time to time, but its not my responsibility and not to mention that is not healthy for the kitties.

Im so grateful with her, but i want through a hard time in this 2 year recovery and this awful conditions are not helping me.

104,1ejjp9s,AITA for calling my family out?,"Hi so I (19) and younger brother (17) are expecting our A level results this Thursday. Mine will determine if I get into uni, my brother’s won’t, but we both view this day as very important. 

Due to ongoing issues with my parents, I moved out at a young age, as recommended by my mental health team. 

My parents have built up this final exam results day to be a huge event in my head, telling me they would save money and we would go out to a fancy restaurant, have a big party, and take me on a shopping trip so long as I got into uni. 

I have faced a lot of challenges, I won’t go into them, but I spent a good chunk of the last few years in and out of hospital. The fact that I was able to keep myself healthy enough to take these exams is nothing short of a miracle.

I found out this week that my parents have booked a trip to Europe, and are touring different countries during results day. They will not be here for me or my brother. 

They blame me for not realising sooner (They never even brought it up as a possibility until today), and have asked me to forgo getting my own results and instead be there for my brother when he gets his. (His are important to him - but will not effect any of his plans for next year, and he has the option to retake - I do not).

I kind of blew up at them, and told them it is not fair to expect me to play the role of a parent because they chose to go away. The exact texts were 

“I’m not going to lie I’m really upset you guys won’t be here for results day since it’s really important to me. It’s a really big day for me and I was hoping you guys would turn up” -me

“Sorry. I will call you though.” - dad

“Every single moment I’ve spent in school and college has led up to this point. I was hoping you and mam would’ve at least considered that. And to expect me to not know my own results to fill in for you and mam is unacceptable.” - me

I was then blocked. 

I want to make it clear that not since childhood have I been upset about them missing events, but this one really got to me. I’m hoping to train to be a doctor, and as you can imagine have worked extremely hard to get there. They built up these expectations in me for years. And while I do feel for my brother, I think I have to put myself first in this situation. I don’t know. 

My parents have since cut all contact with me, and will not unblock me or explain their reasoning. I understand that getting away from everything and de-stressing is so so important, but my parents both work for themselves, and could’ve booked this holiday any other week.

105,1ejiwoe,AITA for wanting a barking/growling dog out of my yard?,"Here's the situation. My family and I moved into a country house in 2018, and recently, our neighbors have let their 2 dogs run into our yard. Since we live in the country, the houses are a decent distance apart and what belongs to somebody should be able to easily stay in their yard. The dogs have been over countless times, any time of day. My family and I have tried calmly talking to the dogs, tried to pet them, and offered to the neighbors to buy the dogs treats to form a bond with them (so they stop barking and growling), however, the owners said, ""they're just not that kind of dogs."" So for months, we have been putting up with chasing annoying dogs out of our yard. 

Here's where the problem comes into play. A few years after moving into this house, a cat would come over a lot and it would be hungry. We started feeding it, and over time we got too attached, named it, and now it lives with us. BUT it technically is not our cat, it has been a neighborhood cat for years (before we even moved in). 

The situation that happened today has happened before, but not to this extent. 

""Our"" cat was wandering in our backyard, when all of the sudden i hear the neighbors calmly calling for their dog (pay attention to the word calmly. They never punish the dog(s) or change their voice to let the dogs know they're in trouble. Instead, to get them to come back to their yard they offer them treats, like the behavior is something to be rewarded?) I already know what's going to happen to I start to run to our cat because I could already tell the dog was gonna chase the cat. Before I even made it to the cat, their dog was less than a foot away from him, barking and growling relentlessly. I yelled at it to get out of our yard and shooed it away, and my mom asked the neighbor (the homeowners son) if they had a leash (in a nice manner). The neighbor replied, ""Yes?"" in a snobby voice, and then the owner of the home came out and asked my mother if she was yelling at his son. This became a large argument. 

To make a long story short, my parents told the neighbors we don't want the dogs in our yard because they are not nice dogs. The neighbor then said that the next time ""our"" cat goes in their yard it's not gonna be pretty (which i find funny because before this it had never been a problem, and I have watched them pet ""our"" cat, he's the sweetest thing and causes no trouble. ALSO, none of the other neighbors have ever had a problem with him, everybody loves him.) 

I want to know, are we the assholes since ""our"" cat also goes in their yard when technically he shouldn't? 

I feel like the neighbors viewpoint could be fair (keep your pet away, we'll keep ours away), but in a sense it's different. 

The cat has been here, he is an outdoor cat and does nothing bad. Technically, it shouldn't even be our problem when he isn't truly ours. The dogs live inside, and act nasty to us, they have no right to be roaming around in our yard when they act the way they do. 

Let me know what you think.

EDIT: Thanks for all the replies! As much as I want to keep the cat inside, we cannot. My mom is highly allergic to cats, but we feel bad not taking care of him. (We do keep him inside of our garage at night to keep him safe from wildlife like coyotes, foxes, etc, but during the day we keep the garage open because we are always outside and doing things, so we wouldn't be able to keep him in during the day.) I would also hate to take away his outside life. We are considering a fence, but as of now it's not really in the budget because our yard is massive and really nothing is cheap anymore. Also, it never really seemed necessary because the neighbor at one point told us he has no problem with the cat going on his property, and that he's sweet. However, since it is now a problem, like I said we are planning on getting a fence at some point in time if things continue to be bad. Again, thank you for all of the replies + advice!

106,1ejiqj0,WIBTA for trying to fix our house the way I want it,"Important context. My (31m) bf (I’ll call him smith) dad had passed and left everything to him and his brother. Both of them decided not to live there anymore and left the house and trailer to their grandma. When smith broke up with his ex, he moved back in with his grandma.

4 years ago. Smith invited me (31f) and my daughter to move in. Everything was going good. I was in charge of taking care of the house while his grandma worked. Smith brought in money, but he didn’t have a regular job. After 7 months, his grandma decided to move to the trailer. She wanted to move her daughter in with her.

Several months later. The house burned down. Everything was gone, even the ashes from smith’s dad was lost. Smith had nothing, but what was in the trailer. I brought everything I owned with me, so I had my daughter and whatever my mom had at her house.

Since it was crowded bc the trailer included 3 small dogs and 2 big ones. My mom and stepdad offered us to stay in their camper. We stayed there until my mom bought a house for me and my daughter. We don’t pay rent.

My (31m) bf (I’ll call him smith) dad had passed and left everything to him and his brother. Both of them decided not to live there anymore and left the house and trailer to their grandma. When smith broke up with his ex, he moved back in with his grandma.

4 years ago. Smith invited me (31f) and my daughter to move in. Everything was going good. I was in charge of taking care of the house while his grandma worked. Smith brought in money, but he didn’t have a regular job. After 7 months, his grandma decided to move to the trailer. She wanted to move her daughter in with her.

Several months later. The house burned down. Everything was gone, even the ashes from smith’s dad was lost. Smith had nothing, but what was in the trailer. I brought everything I owned with me, so I had my daughter and whatever my mom had at her house.

Since it was crowded bc the trailer included 3 small dogs and 2 big ones. My mom and stepdad offered us to stay in their camper. We stayed there until my mom bought a house for me and my daughter. We don’t pay rent.

107,1ejiitj,AITA for not visiting my retired parents weekly?,"AITA for not wanting to have dinner with my parents weekly?

I (32F) moved out of my parent’s house years ago at this point. I have a stable relationship, live with my partner of five years, and have a busy work/life balance. I live about 15 minutes away from my parents. 

My parents (mom, specifically), have been really nagging me lately to spend more time with them. The guilt tripping has increased over the last few months. 

Generally, I go over to my parent’s house on holidays, for birthdays, for random wine tasting days in the spring/summer, I’ll bring them homemade muffins on my way to work…visits aren’t limited to holidays; I see them at least every couple of months. I feel like a spend a decent amount of time with them. 

My mom recently has been really harping on me that I should be coming over every Sunday for family dinner. I honestly don’t want to, and it’s making me wonder if I’m the asshole here. The reason I don’t want to commit to every Sunday is because family dinners tend to last at least 6 hours, with lots of wine being poured. I work early on Mondays and they know this. I simply want my weekends generally for myself, and I have a busy life on my own. My older brother also still lives at home, and I cannot stand my brother (childhood abuse). 

The last Sunday I was there for a dinner, I told them I wasn’t drinking and they were annoyed. Offered me wine no less than 6 times and I kept refusing saying I work in the morning. I only drink 1 day a week now (Friday). They were also upset that I left “early”… at 10pm while they were setting up card games. I had been there since 5pm! I needed to get home and prep for my work week ahead!

Since then my mother has been sending me videos on FB about “you can always come home” and “spending time with your retired parents in their golden years”. I haven’t responded. The guilt tripping doesn’t make me want to reply to texts either.

108,1ejifis,AITAH for organizing a group meetup without a friend that had been ignoring us for almost a whole year?,"First time posting on this sub - any formatting recommendations are appreciated.

Given names are aliases.

I'm a member of a long term, tightly knit online friend group that has known one another for about 10 years. Some of us are newer to the group, others are what you'd call the 'old guard'. I invited someone new to our server (Alias: Sierra) about two years ago. At first Sierra was friendly, very active and spent plenty of time in our voice calls whether we were gaming together or just chilling.

About a year has gone by Sierra informs myself, Tango, Lima, Echo and Alpha about their intentions to become a Twitch streamer. Of course, we pile into their stream and offer as much support as we possibly can - seeing as how Sierra had become quite close to us in the year or so they've been apart of our small community. After a lot of effort Sierra's community had grown quite large and their popularity as a streamer had swelled immensely. Alpha, Tango and myself even made a decent number of new friends through Sierra's community and it looked like smooth sailing for their career.

About 5 or 6 months had gone by and Sierra had begun to disappear from our group and I knew they were busy with their own job, Twitch stream and the slew of newer friends they had made so I took none of it personally. Sierra would still pop in to our voice chats along with reacting to group messages, announcements or to comment on our friends' edits or media content. Their involvement had dwindled further over the course of 2 or 3 more months and a few scant interactions with Sierra had made it apparent they weren't interested in our group as they were before; again, I understood that this was due to their new prospects and busy schedule so I didn't feel slighted. Things would become essentially radio silence from Sierra if we didn't attend their streams directly, as even DM's began to remain unanswered.

This leads to the main event: A group meetup that happened in the middle of last month. I made the announcement through our usual channel and people who were able to attend began making plans in a regular events channel we keep for this sort of thing. Tango, Lima, Echo and Alpha had all planned to attend and Echo began asking if we planned to invite Sierra personally. Seeing as how things were radio silent and several attempts at DM's had already been fruitless, I decided not to invite them to the meetup.

The event lasted for about a week and I can safely say we all had a great time, taking photos and making memories with the people we very rarely get to see in person. These photos would get posted in one of our media channels once everyone had gone home, since Echo enjoys making 'wish you were here' postcards/mini-collages. Upon seeing these photos and reading through the backlog of announcements, Sierra begins spamming my inbox calling me an asshole for not inviting them to the meetup, saying that I 'don't take friendships seriously' and that 'people like me are the reason friend groups break'. I relayed this information to my friends and most agree that it would have been fruitless to invite Sierra, but Lima and Echo have insisted that I'm an asshole for not even trying. I reminded them that we had been losing contact with Sierra for roughly a year and that it was quite plain to see that Sierra wasn't very interested in even talking to us if we weren't in their Twitch chat.

109,1ejid4z,AITAH for refusing to pay before services were given when it wasn't discussed beforehand?,"TL;DR, Landscaper expects me to pay him for his services before he does the work when we didn't discuss it before he showed up AND increases the price by $50. He leaves when its clear I won't pay him until after its done and insinuates I wouldn't pay him after he finished and it would have been a waste of his time.

I hired this guy to mow my lawn since we haven't moved into our new house yet and won't for a few more weeks. Through phone calls and texts he accepts, and tells me he'll squeeze me in on Saturday for $100. Saturday rolls around and I get a text from him that he never asked for the address so I sent it to him. 

He sent me a few photos of our backyard (I haven't seen it in a few weeks) and increased the price by $50 for a total of $150. I agree without argument because it is pretty bad and needs to be done. Only then does he ask if I have Venmo to pay him. I say no, I have Zelle or Apple Pay. He asks if I have Cashapp, I repeat no, my wife has Venmo but she isn't reachable at the moment. 

He says ""I just want to get paid once I complete this""

I tell him I understand but atm all I have is Zelle and Apple Cash but that Zelle would be better because it's faster. He says he doesn't have Zelle. Luckily my wife called me so I asked for her Venmo information and logged in. I ask for the landscaper's information and get it all set up to pay him once he's finished.

After a minute he says ""Are you going to send it?"" I told him that I was going to send it after he finished. 

His response is ""I don't operate like that. We haven't done business before and you have my word, I'm already here. I'm legit"" 

I've never used this guy before and was only recommended to him because the initial lawn care service I was going to use said they don't service my area but he will. I explained that he said he wants to get paid once he completes this and I was making sure I had everything set up to pay him once he completes ""this"".

He says ""Have a nice day sir."" I asked if he was going to do the lawn and when I didn't get a response I told him also to have a nice day and was sorry he wasted his time. 

He came back with ""Noo I'd wasted my time if I'd done that job for you"". My last text to him explained that we didn't discuss how he would get paid until he showed up and if I had known he expected payment upfront I would have either paid him beforehand or hired a company as I had a list of other landscapers in the area and to have a safe drive home.

  
I feel like this is completely unprofessional because he didn't discuss payment until he was already there then with his last comment insinuates that it would have been a waste of his time if he had done the job because I wouldn't pay him. Yet I was expected to trust him because ""he's legit"". I get trust is just part of the business but at no point did I insinuate that I didn't believe he wouldn't do the job regardless.
