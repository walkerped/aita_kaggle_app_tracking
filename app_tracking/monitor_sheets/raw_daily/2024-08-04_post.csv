0,1ek1m8q,AITA - For wishing my Godmother to buy me an expensive gift after she ignored me my whole life?,"
Hello reddit! 

For starters, I'm new here and I've been listening alot of the stories of this subreddit on TikTok so I thought it could be useful to me to share my story. I know I shouldn't expect things from people just because, and I know this sounds like I'm spoiled somehow but hear me out.

My older sister grew up with her godparents living so near us. So near that they ""adopted"" me as their godson. They used to help us with school assignments, gave me rides to things and are usually very nice, but in a way I felt like our bond is not the same as their bond with my sister. Both my parents lost their father when they were young and my grandmothers died when I was a baby. So I have no grandparents and my godparents lived states away. I grew up feeling lonely and envying my cousins and sister for their bond with the rest of the family that I didn't manage to get it right. I'm autistic BTW and social interactions are so hard for me :(

For my godparents. They never tried to reach out for me. My aunts, that live in the same city as them, travel to my city or call my mum. They never bother to try to know me. The excuse always was that they were too busy. Back in 2017, I traveled to my mums hometown with her. It was overall a good trip. I got a chance to see my godparents and visit their house, which was nice cause the last time I went there I was a child. While I was there I couldn't actually talk to them cause they were busy doing stuff. What bothered me is that they were taking care of their grandchildren. I brushed it off, even tho I was hurt. I wasn't feeling well during the trip so I occupied myself with other things until the trip was over.  After that, she continued to ignore me as usual. Until she decided to travel to my hometown for the very first time! I was graduating high school and was very nervous to start college. During her stay I got really sick (urinary infection) and couldn't barely enjoy her company

The thing is that I'm a trans man, and I just went through top surgery, and I'm bored. I've been wanting a Nintendo Switch for so long, but I can't afford it on my own (I'm 23) with my  internship salary. My parents are already taking care of me, so it would be rude to ask them, so I was wondering if I could ask my Godmother to buy me one. I'm not from the US, and the Switch is rather expensive. That may sound that I'm spoiled, but I love giving gifts, doing things for people and I love to recieve as well... she never tried to reach out, and I'm too hurt to do so after she basically turned me down when I tried. Money doesn't seem to be a problem for her (I think) is the thought of asking her and to sound demanding and rude that bothers me. 

So... Am I the asshole for considering the idea of asking her to buy a switch? ",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-08-04,"AITA - For wishing my Godmother to buy me an expensive gift after she ignored me my whole life?

1,1ejvmim,AITA for not apologizing to my mum?,"I (22 f) live with my mum since I can't afford living alone while going to college. Usually I'm quite busy with studying, so I value my free time. I also like to spend a few days alone before doing something big with another person (for example going shopping or watching a movie together).

My mum has been single for a couple years and currently struggles from health issues. She's also quite direct (for example will openly discuss how bisexuality is just a phase in her opinion), which can be challenging from time to time. But she's also a caring person, who can give great live advice. I enjoy living with her and I understand, that her current health has caused her to become quite isolated: At the moment I'm her main source for social interactions, which I try to fulfill, but it's hard sometimes, since she only counts having a movie marathon as spending time together. Everything else we do together (for example eating meals, going shopping, having conversations or playing board games) doesn't count as quality time for her. She also doesn't want to try things that I suggest to spice up our quality time. Thus it's nearly on a daily basis that she complains I don't spend enough time with her and don't love her.

After I spent a little time with her this morning,  I wanted to work on my essay. My mum started to complain and asked me to eat breakfast and watch a movie with her (most movies we watch together are her choice, since she doesn't like what I suggest). I told her that I wanted to work, but was okay with eating breakfast together. So we had breakfast and while we ate my mum started playing a movie which I wasn't really interested in. After we finished breakfast I went into my room to get started with writing, when my mum began her usual complain of me neglecting her. I reminded her, that we spend yesterday evening together playing a board game and that watching movies wasn't the only thing one could do to spend time together.

While I opened up the document, my mum began telling me about a documentary about intersex people in sports, which she had seen last night, and then began to say some transphobic stuff (for example that trans women are only women, if they had bottom surgery) and I was done with that. I tried to correct her (for example pointing out flaws in her logic) and after she said something along the line of ""well, in my opinion this is correct"" I responded with ""yeah, I know, but opinion is and stays different"", thus ending our conversation.

I have to admit that my tone of voice was annoyed during our conversation. Now there's a tension between us; I know she wants an apology from me for my tone and not spending time with her. I'm sorry for how I spoke with her, but not for what I said. Still, I know that the mood around the house will only get better after I apologized and thus swept the whole issue under the rug again.

2,1eji139,AITA for planning a game night only for the couples in my friend group?,"I’m M25. My friend group are all in our early or mid 20s. We do typical friend group activities such as dinners, cocktail bars, hiking, game nights, etc. Often just all the guys will hang out or just the girls, but also very often the whole group gets together.

We are all couples (all longterm living together) except for Riley who is F23 and single. I have no issue with her personally, she’s funny and pleasant during group hang outs.

Riley’s been single for a while, lives alone, and says she feels no urge to get into a relationship. A few people in the group had tried to introduce her to people a few times but she ended up not being interested in any of them.

What bothers me is when the whole group of all couples is together, having just one single person totally throws off the dynamic. It makes the vibe awkward because everyone else has their person with them and Riley is just there alone. It also totally makes our group an odd number which throws off restaurant seating and sways game nights. 

In restaurants it’s especially weird because we have to explain how we’re splitting checks as couples and then just Riley by herself. Also sometimes when one of the guys is sitting on either side of Riley, a waiter will assume he’s her boyfriend by the seating pattern and it messes up the checks and creates an awkward situation.

My gf and I are planning to host game night next weekend and I suggested that we only invite the couples to this one. She asked what I meant and I basically said only the people in our friend group who are couples so it can be a couples game night. My gf said that would only be acceptable IF our friend group was a solid mix of couples vs. single people, but otherwise it’s literally just excluding Riley, who everyone likes.

I said that’s what I wanted, the vibe was weird with just one single person and I want to do more things with just the couples in our friend group so it’s less awkward. My gf got super pissed and snapped at me that nobody else thinks it’s awkward and we’re not leaving Riley out *just* bc she’s not in a relationship. It turned into an argument between my gf and I and she told me that I could just not come if I had such a problem with her being there.

I talked to some of the guys in our group about it expecting them to agree with me, but they all said they have no problem with her coming. One of them even said him and his girlfriend (Riley’s best friend) sometimes go out to dinner with them and Riley and it’s “not weird at all.”

My gf is pissed at me and now the other guys are acting like I have a problem.
