0,1ekqvg4,AITA for telling my brother to get out and taking his bitch of a wife when he asked for some of our mom’s ashes,"My mom used to live near my brother, she was a quiet person in general and after dad died was lonely. She wanted to have dinner with my brother and his family often. His wife ( cara) didn’t like that and they agreed to do it once a month. 

Mom started to have issue and would send panicked texts and went to the doctors randomly. Around this time his wife made a lot of post about how she was  an attention seeker and was making up problems. That she was trying to cause a wedge in their relationship. My brother stopped visiting our mother. It was everywhere and I do not like Cara at all.

When this started happening I decided to visit my mom( live in another state). It took me a day to realize something was wrong. Took her to the doctors and she had dementia.  I informed the family and became the main caretaker. Cara continue to make post or comments that she is faking it. My brother stood by her the whole time. 

I literally begged him to come visit before she passed on. She was cremated and I have the ashes. He didn’t even come to the viewing. 

This is the issue, he and Cara showed up asking for some of our moms ashes. I told him no, that he didn’t even see her before she died. This started an argument against the two. 

By the end of it I told him to get out and take his bitch of his wife with him. He has been calling me a jerk and telling me I have to apologize.

2,1eka101,AITAH: Covid Friends go to Music Festival,"Hi all, I went to my first music festival this weekend. Was excited, but my close friend tested postive for COVID the night before. They're at the festival not wearing a mask, and the head's up was ""hey funny thing I have COVID"" to the rest of the group chat prior to the festival. I was shocked the friend went, and was equally suprised others in the group were ok. I have plans that COVID would derail, and thus tried to avoid them all this weekend, ending up sitting alone for a majority of a festival I spent $400ish dollars on. 

Note, this friend also thought I could drive them to this festival when they had COVID.  Appreciate their honesty in admitting to the infection, but given their overzealous defense against COVID during the pandemic, I think it's ironic that I have to be the leper.


The whole event has just been awkward. Insanely hot outside, the event seems like it was poorly organized, and would terrorize those with any hint of claursterphohia. He and everything else has soured my experience.

The biggest question, am I the asshole in being upset and dissappointed with my friends? Some insisted that it would be fine, others thought that if they get the virus, then oh well.

3,1ek9vwh,AITA for not cleaning up after my dad,"AITA for not cleaning up after my dad?

For some context, I live with my dad and younger brother. Our parents aren’t divorced but live in different cities for their jobs so our mom comes to visit on the weekends. My dad, brother, and sister have always been slobs leaving messes wherever they go.

Recently my parents went camping and my dad was preparing stuff in the kitchen and left a huge mess, with stains on the counters, crumbs, and unwashed dishes. They came home and my mom got mad at me for not cleaning up the kitchen while they were gone. I told her it wasn’t my mess so I’m not responsible for cleaning it, I’ve always believed this because as a kid I hated always cleaning up for other people’s mess. She got mad and was saying it’s your dads mess so you should clean it up, to which I responded and said if that were true why doesn’t my brother have to clean up after anyone then. She got mad saying she always cleans up after the family so I should clean too. I always clean up after myself and make sure it was cleaner than it was before. Even when I do help her clean she always complains that no one helps her clean, but she doesn’t do anything to make my dad or brother clean. The only times they do clean is if she gets mad at them and starts yelling, but they never do a satisfying job, leaving things sticky and still a mess.

During the week when my mom isn’t there I’m the only one cleaning and doing chores (taking out trash/recycle, sweeping, etc.) She always tells me to have my brother help me but when I tell him he doesn’t listen and just plays games. I do all these chores while also having to study for an exam to get my license as an RN. 

With that after I get a job my mom is also expecting me to pay the bills for the house my dad, brother, and I live in since I’ll be making more than him. And it’s just like if I’m doing all the chores and paying for the house how is that fair. I understand and appreciate that they’ve raised me and helped pay for my life expenses but it’s just unfair that I have to do everything while my siblings and dad get to be lazy and messy cause they’re always like that.

If I could I would move out but my mom expects me to help my parents pay bills and their debt. I also have school loans that I have to payback and I want to pay off my credit card but if I have to help them with all these things. My mom always tells me it’s more worth it to stay at home cause it’s cheaper than renting. Even though RNs get paid decently in my state my mom makes double what I would be making. 

I feel like because my mom has always seen me as being more responsible than my siblings so she expects a lot more from me. Which I don’t see as fair. She called me selfish and self-centered for not cleaning up after my dad because it’s not some random person I’m cleaning up after it’s my dad.

6,1el2weg,WIBTA for lying to my dying aunt,"My aunt is on hospice and likely going to pass away very soon. She is showing all the textbook signs: not eating, hardly moving, and getting suddenly confused about who is alive or dead (she keeps trying to call my grandma who has been dead for over 30 years).

My aunt is being survived by my uncle.

A few years ago, we had another scare where we thought it was her time, and had started discussing how she wanted to leave things. She told my dad that she wanted to leave her half of their home to me and my sister as she had no kids of her own, and we are her only nieces. The other half of the home would stay with my uncle. My sister and I weren't comfortable with that because it would essentially mean we'd become half responsible for the ongoing mortgage payments, as my uncle plans on living out his days there and was considering refinancing to get some extra cash. We explained that we didn't want to be my uncle's landlord or responsible for keeping the mortgage afloat, and asked her if she could remove us from that part of the will.

She was somewhat offended that 'we didn't want her money' but agreed and took us out, leaving everything to my uncle. Since then, my uncle updated his will so that when he passes, everything would go to charity. Me and my sister were a little surprised we were completely cut out, but were never expecting any kind of payout before the topic came up, so we were just relieved to not have to get mixed up in managing house finances with my uncle anymore.

Fast forward to today, my aunt is on her deathbed and asking my parents that my sister and I inherit her china collection and some antique furniture. My sister and I are both moms of newborns who live in small homes, and we simply have no space left to keep stuff that is frankly going to be a hazard for little kids.

We worked a temp job for 10 months at the same company and barely got by during that time. When the strikes ended, I got hired onto a show and with my union pay back, encouraged her to quit the temp job, which she talked about hating constantly. 

I paid all of the bills for two months, before she took a job out of town for a month and a half, where her rent and food were paid for. She left with the intention of saving up and returning to find work with money in the bank, in case it didn’t happen right away. 

She’s been back for a month now and hasn’t found anything, though she has been applying to jobs. But my other show has since finished and I am now working on a different show, but with less pay. This month I’ll have to pay the rest of the bills again. 

All this to say, when I come home, the house is a mess; it took her 3 weeks to unpack her suitcase, which sat on our kitchen floor for that duration. Laundry piles up in front of the machine; there’s random clothes scattered across our bedroom. It’s like I’m in college again (in the worst way possible). 

Still, I know she’s going through it, so I don’t say anything for the most part. But then she gets onto me for not helping around the house, which really irks me when I’m not home 12-14 hours out of the day. 

On top of that, she gives me crap for being messy for the few hours I am home. And, hate to say it, but the house was much cleaner while she was out of town. 

And I am not the “the-woman-should-be-the-caretaker-for-the-household” type, but in this situation, it’s literally her only job while I’m gone all day.

Here’s a little background, I go to a beauty school and I met Jade and Lucy there we have been the trio since the beginning but me and Jade have always been a bit closer. About a month ago I found out that I had Chlam*dia and I was extremely embarrassed about it and I confided in my two friends Jade and Lucy because I trusted them with this information and they gave me no reason not to until 2 weeks ago.. So I was working on my mannequin and accidentally cut my finger and Jade offered to clean it and put a band-aid on it for me. At this point I already tested that I was good and no longer had Chlam*dia so we went back to dispensary and Lucy and a more or less school friend was there with her we will call her Emma 19F, so Jade cleans my cut and puts a band-aid on it so I walked away because a teacher needed me and when I came back Emma asks me if me and her had the same sexual disease and I was taken back and was like what?! And she said did you have chlam*dia and I looked at Jade and Lucy and said how does she know?! And Jade and Emma threw Lucy under the bus and said Lucy kinda gave it away and they recited what she said which was that she asked Jade about washing her hands because my blood could get into one of her cuts and Jade said that it’s not like that and with Emma being right there she asked what they were talking about and they said it’s not their business to tell which concluded to Emma that I had something. So I turned to Lucy and said Not to be b*tch but that was kinda f*ed what you said.

So I Kayla, 21F, recently got into a disagreement with my friend Lucy, 19F, because she exposed something personal about me when she was trying to look out for our other friend, Jade, 18F. Here’s a little background, I go to a beauty school and I met Jade and Lucy there we have been the trio since the beginning but me and Jade have always been a bit closer. About a month ago I found out that I had Chlam*dia and I was extremely embarrassed about it and I confided in my two friends Jade and Lucy because I trusted them with this information and they gave me no reason not to until 2 weeks ago.. So I was working on my mannequin and accidentally cut my finger and Jade offered to clean it and put a band-aid on it for me. At this point I already tested that I was good and no longer had Chlam*dia so we went back to dispensary and Lucy and a more or less school friend was there with her we will call her Emma 19F, so Jade cleans my cut and puts a band-aid on it so I walked away because a teacher needed me and when I came back Emma asks me if me and her had the same sexual disease and I was taken back and was like what?! And she said did you have chlam*dia and I looked at Jade and Lucy and said how does she know?! And Jade and Emma threw Lucy under the bus and said Lucy kinda gave it away and they recited what she said which was that she asked Jade about washing her hands because my blood could get into one of her cuts and Jade said that it’s not like that and with Emma being right there she asked what they were talking about and they said it’s not their business to tell which concluded to Emma that I had something. So I turned to Lucy and said Not to be b*tch but that was kinda f*ed what you said. Lucy got defensive but eventually walked away the next day she texted me that she was sorry but because I see her Monday-Friday I felt like I deserved a in-person sorry rather than her text so I never responded.

11,1el1ufr,AITA: I couldn’t go to my friends birthday because of work,"My friend (of nearly 4 years) made a group chat with around 20 people, one week in advance from her birthday (the 6th )and said her celebration would be bar hopping in a city quite far from where I live. Problem was, I was already given my work shifts (I work 2 jobs) and we did discuss what she wanted to do for her birthday around a month in advance and she said whatever she wanted to do probably wouldn’t be on her actual birthday and said nothing till that group chat was made. So I accepted shifts from both jobs. Her plan was to meet in the city around 5pm, however my waitressing job would finish only at 9:30pm on that day and I would have to start the next day at 8am. If I did go travelling there would take more than an hour and by the time I get there the last affordable mode of transport home would be shut by 11pm. So was there really any point? Everyone would’ve been drunk already and I would’ve spent nearly $80 getting there and going back just for an hour? Once she made the group chat I did try to get someone to cover my shift so I could go but everyone was busy. I let her know I couldn’t come and she seemed fine. On the day of her birthday I wished her happy birthday and she didn’t open the text for nearly two days, and it was noticeable as we texted everyday beforehand and ever since it’s been radio silence.

12,1el1gdf,AITA for ‘excluding’ my BIL’s girlfriend at my anniversary dinner?,"


I 29F and my husband Dan 27M invited close friends and family for dinner and with their kids our guest list was ~30. Most our friends are in long term relationships and we are friends with their partners, but my BIL Sam wanted asked us if he could bring her girlfriend Rose of 1 month to the anniversary dinner. We met Rose once at my In-laws two weeks ago, and I don’t know her well, but I didn’t want BIL to feel excluded at the event as we had invited other SO’s so we said yes. 

Before dinner, we played a quiz where the questions were on us as a couple, some inside jokes and about friends who were there. My MOH made me a video of some recordings from our wedding, and she had contacted other people from our wedding and they had recorded themselves wishing us a happy anniversary. Sam and Rose left earlier than everyone- but we didn’t think this was unusual as Sam mentioned he was working the next day and he was going to leave earlier.

Sam sent my husband a text to say Rose felt excluded at the dinner and it was really awkward for her so they left earlier. He said we could have included her a bit more and the quiz and wedding video was awkward for her and she didn’t understand the quiz jokes and she didn’t come to the wedding. He thought we could have accommodated her a bit more especially as we knew in advance that she was coming and that it was cruel.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-05,"AITA for ‘excluding’ my BIL’s girlfriend at my anniversary dinner?

13,1el14a5,AITAH for letting my dogs bark at road workers?,"I live in a suburban neighborhood with a large, fully fenced yard that backs up to a somewhat busy road. I have two dogs that are medium/large (a 4F GSD mix and a 2M pitbull mix). The GSD is shy, and the pitbull is friendly, but both have BIG barks. Of note, they cannot get over/around our fence (concrete inlay and over 5' tall), nor have they ever even attempted it. They are used to being allowed out in their yard at their leisure, and while we monitor them outside, we are not always outside with them. They have toys, water, and shelter outside with them and they come to the door when they want to come inside for a break. Most, if not all, of our neighbors also have dogs, also have fenced yards, and also let their dogs out into their yards with fairly minimal supervision for extended periods.

Recently, the city decided to clean up the drainage systems and as such there has been construction happening on the road behind our house for a few weeks now. The workers routinely come over and lean on our fence (we don't mind this) or otherwise stand on the sidewalk in front of our fence while they are working. When we see them leaning or standing close by, we will not let the dogs out, but sometimes it happens when they are already in the yard. If that happens, our dogs will run to the fence and bark at the workers. We always call them into the house when they start barking, but I know it scares the workers, and one of them even yelled something across the fence at me once (I do not speak the language he was using, not sure what he said).

I was lamenting the situation with my mother the other day and she said it was wrong of me to let the dogs into the yard at all while they are working, and that they should only go out once the workers have left for the day. I feel that's a bit unfair to my dogs, who are used to being allowed out when they please, not just to run but also to potty. She disagreed and said that was the price of having ""scary"" dogs.

14,1el1366,AITA for not letting sister move back in after mom goes in a nursing home ,"AITA for not wanting sister to move back to family home after she didn’t help care for her mother 

I’ve lived with my mother for 12 years, both siblings lived elsewhere. The last two years my mother was diagnosed with dementia and since has declined so far she was placed on a crisis list and is moving into a home this week. I’m heartbroken, but it needs to happen. 

My two siblings have not helped once since her decline, my mom needs 24 hour care which we managed between myself my 19 year old daughter and her lifelong friend. It’s been an extremely tough year. 

I asked siblings last year to move back to collectively help in her care and try to keep this house, plus knowing the home they occupied would soon be sold, both declined. Sister has visited 4 times in 9 months for supervised visits, no meals provided, offer of a night off nothing. 3 hours then gone. Brother hasn’t been her since December. 

Sister was informed we are placing mom in a
Home, she visits the next day and sends me a message saying she will be moving in end of the month (she has to be out of her home then, has known of this since May, no arrangements up till now) I’m infuriated, this home when she passes will be divided equally as per moms wishes but until then this home is meant to provide financially for her care. 

My relationship with my sister has always been strained, and after this year of feeling abandoned by both siblings when mom, me and niece needed them I feel living together in a shared house hold will be a disaster. 

I am poa of moms affairs, I planned to continue to live here and pay for the household expenses as I have to keep this home for as long as we can. 

After such rough last two years I want peace and I know this will be a mess. Sisters daughter has already asked my daughter for her room bc she likes it better. Entitlement is boiling my blood. 

Aita to send a messages stating how disappointed I am in both of their lack of concern/care for their mother and that I feel this will be a toxic household if she moves in. Brother and sister hate each other now from living with each other and did not take good care of the other home they shared from a family member, rent free. 

I don’t want to put my sister and niece “out” but this all seems so calculated to come back when mom’s gone. We are all getting an inheritance from home being sold as well.

100% no longer have feelings for her, or any subconscious desires. Immediately right there the larger part of me says keep it inside.

I'm married with kids, so is she. My wife will be at the reunion with me, and knows that I had a crush on this gal for just a year.

My only reason for mentioning it, was in Junior year I made a gesture (whatever it's called) and never told her it was me. I believe it was the last day before winter break, I had decorated her car, mistletoe around the sunroof, writing something about deserving a kiss on the wondows. Had a teddy bear on the windshield too (someone stole it). She had an on/off boyfriend at the time so I never knew the right time to bring it up, and eventually I actually realized I'd never enjoy a relationship with her, so lost all feelings for her besides as friends.

My wife knows about this, we've been married 13 years, together for 19.

Just something inside me always felt stupid for never owning up on it and letting her know.

I don't need to let her know, but I wonder if I should, if I'll feel relief no longer keeping it in. Or, WIBTAH of I do? Not just to her, but to her husband and my wife as well.

I had a man offer me to buy the games but not the switch.

19,1el0jmo,WIBTAH if I sold the Viola that my mom bought for me to buy a bass guitar?,"Hi! In case anyone doesn’t know what a viola is, it's a small Cello, played like a Violin. 

My mom started a tradition with my brother, where she'd buy us our instrument in the 10th grade.

I had been a bit wishy washy about playing viola when I started high school. I gave the viola a break in the 10th grade, but decided to give it a second chance in the 11th grade. During this time, I started Idealizing playing other instruments. But my mom bought me my viola, locking me into it. My senior year was awful. There were some traumatic things that happened that led to me having severe anxiety. I tried to push past it and participate in a music contest by my school district. The contest is every year, I had done it before. But this year, thanks to all the anxiety, and my mom pushing me to play a song that was too hard for me, I froze up, just 5 bars from the end of the song. I stood there for at least a minute, panicking, unable to even remember how the rest of the song went. I finally got myself to finish the song, but I knew I was screwed. I got the lowest score I ever had that year, when it should have been my best. On top of this, my school got a new orchestra teacher who hardly acknowledged my presence. Typically teachers would make sure they were at their student's auditions. But my teacher scheduled another group over me…

After that year, I could hardly look at the viola. I took it with me to University where I played it once every few months. I tried joining the University orchestra to maybe give it one last chance. But my professor wasn’t very patient with me being rusty. Granted, I never wanted to practice.

It's been about 2 years since I last tried to play it. The only desire left to play the instrument comes from a place of guilt. So it just sits in my spare room, untouched.

In the meantime, I've been having issues with my mom. She has not been very supportive of me in my mental health. I came to her about wanting to... you know... not be on earth anymore... and she sarcastically told me to ""go to a hospital then. Otherwise shut up."" 

Now the question at hand. What do I do with the viola? I want it to go to a home where it can be loved and played. I don't think I can take care of it like it needs. I still love music. I love to sing and play my ukulele. I have always wanted to be in a band, and was considering getting a bass guitar and learning it. I've always wanted to play bass, even in high school. My mom paid around 1500 for the viola. I figure I could get at least 1000 off it, and that would easily pay for a bass. But I wonder if that's wrong? To profit off a gift? I would essentially be trading it for one I would use. And also I think that with selling the viola, anyone willing to pay 1000 for it, would actually want it and use it. Where I worry that donating it will land it in hands that will not appreciate it, or abuse it.

Would I be wrong to sell my voila that my mom got for me, to pay for a bass? Or would it be better to just donate it?

20,1el0d7d,AITA for planting a mushroom in my roommate's dirty dishes to make a point?,"
I (25M) have a roommate, Jake (26M), who has a serious issue with leaving dirty dishes in the sink. We’ve had several discussions about this, but nothing changes. The mess was getting out of hand, and it was really starting to affect my mental state.

Last week, I decided to take a more extreme approach to make my point. I found a mushroom growing outside and decided to plant it in one of the dishes that had been in the sink for a couple of weeks. I thought maybe seeing actual fungus growing in his dishes would make him realize how bad things had gotten.

I didn’t mean to cause any drama, but Jake’s girlfriend ended up finding the dish first. She was horrified, and the situation led to a big argument between them. Apparently, this incident made her realize how much of a slob Jake is, and it ended up being a breaking point for their relationship.

Now Jake is furious with me, blaming me for his breakup and calling me a jerk for creating such a situation. I really didn’t intend for things to escalate like this, but at the same time his habits are disgusting and need to change regardless of whether his dishes are fertile ground for portobellos. I feel bad about it so I texted his girlfriend to explain that it was just a joke but she’s had it with him and seems to be done whether it was real or not. I’m worried this is going to ruin my friendship with Jake but at the same time don’t really feel it’s all on me. Our friends seem to be siding with him so far.

22,1el00yc,AITA for making a rude comment about my girlfriend being hypocritical?,"For context, I'm a college student who is currently getting a degree in nursing. I've always had a passion for healthcare and am super excited to become a nurse full time. I work hard between college and my full time job, and it can all stack up and feel really overwhelming for me.

My girlfriend takes up a lot of my time as well, which I fully understand and willingly make for her, often sacrificing time with my friends and things to spend time with her. I know this is a part of a serious relationship and I'm not complaining.

My girlfriend told me that I wasn't doing enough, and I didn't want enough with my life. This comment surprised me, as like I said I have plans to go far in the medical field, and work on the side. She mentioned that I didn't have any goals other than her, and that I was seemingly too reliant on her.

This made me somewhat mad, I'll admit. The main reason being that part of my being in this relationship is the fact that I will be the main financial support. She is a high school dropout, who lives with her dad and works hardly more than 2-3 hours a week. We have plans to move in together in which I would have to buy the house, and pay for the majority of everything due to the fact that I currently make and will continue to make more money than her. When I asked her what she intended to do, she told me she wanted to travel with her friends, meaning I will have to pay for more so she can fund her various trips she expressed I would not be going on.

Despite this he refused to plan accordingly for anything past a month from now. Every time he came into my life it was traumatic in that it was either to scream at me about not contacting him when I was younger and more recently it was when he was having a medical emergency or needed to be bailed out of jail despite me being hundreds of miles away. Needless to say every time the phone rang and it was him my anxiety would spike because I knew it was either one of those or some errand that was not only unnecessary but extremely inefficient and inconvenient for me to complete. I almost always did what he asked of me despite voicing my objections because I wanted to be a good son and these errands/requests weren’t unlawful only very inconvenient for me. 

When I would go see him I barely spoke and we spent much of the time in silence, to the point where over the years he thought I was a quiet person but I actually just didn’t enjoy conversation with him because he just used me as an echo chamber for his own thoughts and opinions and whenever I tried to genuinely communicate with him he was genuinely confused and became dismissive because I broke character. At various times throughout my childhood he made hurtful comments and used random corporal punishment that stayed with me into adulthood and a few years ago my mother mentioned some domestic abuse that I had actually buried so deep in my memory that I had forgotten about it. 

In his last few years, he only met his grandson once and never asked for a picture of him. He refused to change his schedule to attend my wedding despite months of advance notice because he couldn’t find a ride DESPITE traveling internationally alone at the time I was married. When I got the call that he was on his deathbed we hadn’t spoken in months as he had never reached out to me after missing my wedding and I decided that was the last straw. I arrived at his side and gathered his other family, they all had nice memories of him because they saw him on holidays and other nice events like that… I had no such attachment as I had dealt with the worst of him for my entire life. When his moment came I had a solemn face but did not feel the sadness that his family felt as I had lost him as a father decades before.

I pay more than them for far less space because they act as if they own the place. Last week we had an argument when they demanded I pay 80% of the energy bill because I run a medium sized fan (we have no AC). They became very nasty, throwing a tantrum and started making a lot of complaints about me and blaming me for things (I stayed civil). I am still pissed off about it.

Our apartment has no guest parking. My roommate found out I rented another parking space for guests, which costs me $75/month. I have no idea how they discovered my parking space number because I don't see it on the resident portal, but now they want to use it for their guests. This frustrates me not only because they always financially exploit me, but because in the past when I give them an inch they take a mile and I don't want their guests over for hours every day. If they want a guest parking space, they can pay for it like I did. Additionally, I find it creepy that they contacted the leasing agent to find out my parking space number, as I couldn't find any documents online stating it, and they have a history of being nosy. WIBTA if I refused to let my roommate use my extra parking space for their guests?

**Update:** Thanks, everyone, for validating my side. I struggle with being a pushover, but I stood up for myself and didn't let her use the space.

As expected, they're pissed off now. Like in the past, they arrange things before asking me, assuming I'll say yes. For example, they once kept scheduling visits to visit their son in jail without consulting me first, expecting me to stay in the apartment and watch her dog with severe attachment anxiety for 5+ hours regularly for free because I agreed once, not knowing the dog's issues. There are MANY crazy details to that situation... They had already planned to have their friends over and I guess it couldn't happen without using my parking space, so now they're upset.

I don't know what to do if they use the spot anyway because I can't imagine the drama that would ensue if I had their friend's car towed.

28,1ekz7bx,AITA for telling my mom she isn't invited to my brother's wedding because she was extremely rude to his fiancee?,"I'll get right to it. My (24F) brother, Connor (27M) and his fiancee Christine (27F) are getting married in early 2025. They got engaged a few months ago and have recently sent out wedding invitations. My mom is upset because she wasn't invited. 

Background info, we met Christine after she and Connor had been dating for around 8 months. That was a few years ago. Basically, my mom just didn't like her. After we met her, she'd constantly complain and criticize Christine, this would range from her looks, to her job (Christine is a waitress) and ""she isn't good enough for my son."" I honestly don't get any of it. Christine and I became friends, and she's such a sweet person who wouldn't hurt a fly. Whenever Christine and Connor came over for dinner or an event, she wouldn't say anything to Christine, but she'd try to get Connor to always spend time with her instead of Christine. She always tried to one-up Christine as well. If she called Connor and he mentioned that Christine made dinner, her dinner was always better. If Christine had a gift for Connor, my mother always tried to say how her gift was better. Thankfully, my brother is not stupid and has realized this. To avoid starting family drama, he didn't condemn her loudly in front of everyone, but would always defend Christine if he heard her talking shit. He made it clear that if she kept badly about Christine all the time, he would go extremely low contact. That made her stop for a while, but since they announced their engagement, she's back to it again. Maybe she forgot, idk. I do think it's because Connor is her son and I know some mothers can be very clingy with their sons. I have a boyfriend, and I've never heard her say a bad word about him, so I do really think it's because Connor is her son and I am her daughter.

I was at my mom's house yesterday, and my mom complained that she wasn't invited. She said Christine was ""stealing"" Connor from her. I told her Connor getting married didn't necessarily mean Christine was ""stealing"" him. Then I asked her what exactly she didn't like about Christine. It all really led back to the same thing, ""She's stealing my son."" I told her that while she can't control how she feels, she can control her actions and that talking about Christine like that was the reason she wasn't invited. I tried to say it gently, but she did not take it well. She tried to make excuses and say that it was fine and that it's just her venting to her family and friends, and that I was being inconsiderate of her feelings. I know how she feels about it, but I think those feelings aren't really an excuse for talking shit behind someone's back like that, and going out of your way to make it clear you dislike them. I know damn well I'm not the only person in the family who would agree with me. I told Connor about it, and he said I was right and that she needed a reality check. But it's been weighing on my mind.

She didn't disagree with me, but still thinks I'm being a bit petty. She said that it would be unfair to ask her mother and sister to be her support people in the delivery room and then tell them they have to wait to meet the baby until after I've had a chance to come into the room and do so.

My younger sister is enrolled part-time in community college, and I’ve had to help her with this, as I always have. My parents always relied on me to help her when they couldn’t.

One day, I discovered my younger sister wasn't enrolled in college because she missed the deadline and hid it by pretending to be in online classes. She won’t take action unless told, so she didn’t check the deadline. I had to re-enroll her and fill out her FAFSA to ensure she takes classes instead of just staying home and watching videos or drawing.

My sister lives at home without contributing unless asked and will do it reluctantly. She’s had temporary summer jobs but avoids work during school due to her anxiety. She claims she wants to save money and doesn’t help since my parents don’t ask for it.

My sister wants to save money but doesn’t contribute while spending freely on food, trips, and art supplies. I’ve been frustrated for a while, and our recent argument was no different from others, except I called her inept.

She got an offer from one place but ignored it because she said the bus ride would be too long.

A few days ago, I asked my sister to apply for more jobs, but my mom said she should focus on school instead, claiming I was lucky to manage both. This triggered me because I’ve struggled a lot—advocating for myself as a disabled person, dealing with my older sister's outbursts, and enduring my parents' gaslighting. My mom has seen this but insists I’m capable of everything, unlike my younger sister. I reminded my mom of her dismissive response when I pointed out my household contributions, which she denied. I told her it was unfair that they accepted my help but never expected my inept sister to contribute.

My mom says my words hurt my sister. My goal is not to hurt anyone, but she needs a rude awakening because she cannot always use her anxiety as an excuse.

34,1ekxw26,AITA for not coming out to my dad?,"I don’t really know how to start a post like this, so I’ll just get into it. (Also sorry for any spelling/grammar mistakes, I’m tired.) 

I (15) have been “out” as a lesbian (I’m  also agender but no one I know is aware of that) to everyone around me for pretty much a year now. It was really hard coming out to anyone around me because all of  my inner circle were  basically all very traditional Mormons (like my bff / any of my friends, and all my family) and they have been pretty homophobic in the past. But nevertheless I started coming out to people because I’m too gay to keep it in a closet. I had lost some friends and family started acting weird around me but the real kicker was my dad. He had always been the biggest “anti gay” person in my life and I didn’t really feel safe coming out to him, but other then that me and him always had a god relationship. But around October of last year he did something that completely shattered my trust in him completely (I won’t get into details here, all I can say is that the police were involved) . So now I definitely didn’t want to come out to him. Following that incident I was sent to a mental hospital for my depression and while there my mom looked through my phone and found out I was a lesbian. I got really mad abt that because it felt like my trust had been broken. I yelled at her but then my therapist at the hospital informed me that this Is a completely normal thing for parents to do while their children were hospitalized. So am i the asshole for that? Anyway going back to the original question lol. After I was released from the hospital my mom informed me that I needed to tell my dad I was a lesbian. I obviously said no because I didn’t feel safe to do so, especially with what happened. My mom told me that in order to fix the relationship with my dad I needed to be honest to him, and that by not coming out to him I was withholding information from him that “didn’t really matter.” But I still said no. Over the next couple of months my mom and my grandma  continued to pressure me into coming out to my dad (btw my mom told my grandma I was lesbian, I did not.) Finally I gave up and I told my dad because I did want to start fixing my relationship with him. He informed me that he already knew because my mom told him when she  looked through my phone and found out. Nothing terrible happened and it’s “fine” now, so was I being the asshole for not telling my dad I was a lesbian?

35,1ekxvs8,AITA for snapping at my daughter (4F) for sucking up when it felt like she was just doing it to antagonize her brother? ,"Throwaway account.

AITA for snapping at my daughter for sucking up when it felt like she was just doing it to antagonize her brother? 

I (32M) took my wife (29F), daughter (4F), and stepson (4M) to Disney. My daughter lives in Florida with her mom (we live out of state), so she's been to Disney before. On the drive to Disney from where we live, she talked nonstop about the Dumbo ride. A lot of Dumbo. She hyped Dumbo up A LOT, so my stepson was extremely excited, to put it lightly.

We got to the park and went straight to Dumbo, but the wait was kind of long. We said we'd do other things with shorter lines, come back to check the wait, and then just go when it dies down. We went and rode all of the other kids things, got lunch, ya know - did the day, but the ride time at Dumbo just kept getting longer. 

Finally at the end of the day, we knew we were going to just have to just deal with the line, which was still longer than the beginning of the day. Bad call on our part, obviously. So we wait. And wait. And finally get to the top of the line, where there's the Must Be This Tall sign. Clearly the kids aren't tall enough to ride on their own, but because my daughter had hyped it up so much, my stepson wanted to ride with her. We told him he couldn't. He absolutely lost his shit. He was exhausted and understandably upset. My wife said she would take her son, but warned me that they were picking the color first. I laughed because it was such a nonsensical request, but said ok. 

My daughter and I got in the Dumbo ahead of theirs, my stepson still screaming and crying. My daughter kept pushing the button so we would go up and down, and overly sweetly saying things like, ""Isn't this fun, Daddy?"" and ""I'm having the best time!"" 

Meanwhile, my stepson hasn't pushed the button a single time, so they're just riding around on the very bottom; my wife pissed, and my stepson throwing a fit. 

Maybe this should have been funny, but it just pissed me off. It felt like she was being so overly sweet, as if to show off that she wasn't doing what my stepson was doing. I snapped at her to stop sucking up and she stopped saying anything.

39,1ekx807,AITA For Not Measuring The Dog Water Formula Correctly,"I'm more so doing this for just some peace in mind. I'm kind of wondering if I really did fuck up or not.

I (20F) woke up this morning and the first thing I did was to get my dogs a fresh container of water. We usually use this formula to help get rid of bad breath and whiten teeth. It's measurement is for each 8 oz.  or 1 cup add 1 teaspoon of the formula. The container that we use holds about 8 cups of water, but I was a little worried I did the math wrong so I added like 5 teaspoons instead of 8 in case my dogs got sick or something. I also kind of eyeballed how much water was in the container since there weren't any indicators in it.

As I was starting to pour the water, my mom (46F) asked me how much did I use. I said 5 teaspoons, and then things started to go downhill from there. My mom basically exploded at me and threw a huge tantrum. She was shouting and was extremely emotional. I was a little shocked from this reaction, and asked her what she is so mad about.

She was upset because she instructed me a few months prior how to measure the water properly i.e. using this large measuring pitcher. I forgot these instructions and so read the manual on the back of the container instead. On top of that, I was kind of eyeballing it so the measurements were even more off.

And then she went to rant about how every mistake I do just frustrates her and that she hates it when she needs to remind me of something more than once. These resulted in long sessions of just arguing. I would try to remove myself but she would keep calling me back and yell at me some more. Just earlier today I was just doing my own thing and she stormed into the office trying to prove that she was right behave this way.

She insists that being this angry and yelling at me is alright and that it's wrong of me to try to defend myself. She thinks she is always correct and says things like, ""Oh I guess EVERYTHING is my fault then? And you're always right"" or ""I'm just a pyscho to you aren't I?"" sarcastically. Is this gaslight? In her perspective, I am just a rebellious child who does not listen. And maybe that is true, I've had issues with remembering instructions. But I don't mean no disrespect. I always try to solve my mistakes if I am notified. What I am upset about is that instead of being told calmly of what I am doing wrong, I am instead getting verbally harassed and yelled at for a small mistake.

Let me know if more info is needed. Thanks in advance.

EDIT: Thanks guys I think I realized I kind of did screw up the measurements and need to correct that.

41,1ekx1vd,AITA for spoiling my girlfriend’s cousin’s engagement?,"This happened back on July 4th, but people are still sore about it. My girlfriend’s cousin (let’s call her Miranda) invited us to her place for a BBQ. A few days prior, Miranda posted a picture on Instagram of her and her boyfriend, George. It was a photo of him on one knee proposing to her. The caption read something like “I said yes! Can’t wait to marry my love.” She has a lot of followers, and a lot of people liked it and commented with congratulations. My girlfriend and I both liked it and commented as well. 


A few days later was the BBQ. George and most of her family was already there. After we got settled, we both said congratulations to them both. Everything went silent. Miranda, George, and their parents looked horrified. Miranda’s parents said, “You told them?!” And she shook her head. Of course everyone around them was surprised and said things like “You guys are getting married?” “Congratulations!”. My gf and I instantly knew that the rest of their family didn’t know yet. It was so awkward, and Miranda and George seemed very uncomfortable. Later, Miranda’s mom angrily took us aside and told us that it was supposed to be a surprise. George was planning on doing ANOTHER proposal at the BBQ, this time for the family. We explained that they already announced their engagement online, and the mom told us that most of Miranda’s family doesn’t use social media. Apparently the first one was just for friends and the internet. 

Later, George ended up proposing again anyway, but it felt so awkward. It seemed like it was supposed to be a big moment. The fact that everyone already knew kind of ruined it. We felt so bad. No one really talked to us for the rest of the party. Miranda and George wouldn’t even look at us. When we left, we talked about how we shouldn’t have said anything. Then again, we thought that it would’ve been weird if we congratulated them online and not acknowledge it when we saw them in person. We’ve been talking about whether we should have said anything. My gf said no one from that side of the family has spoke to her since. AITA, or in this case, are we?

42,1ekwufy,AITA for yelling at my neighbor for trying to mow my yard?,"I (15F) have been mowing my yard for the past 3 years or so. I have a specific way I mow my yard (front and back) to make sure that it grows evenly and healthy (such as what direction I mow it each time and the level I mow it at). I quite enjoy mowing my yard as I listen to music or a podcast throughout. Usually I would mow my yard every 2 weeks or so, but since I have been busy, I had missed a week. 

Yesterday, my neighbor (around mid 30s M) tried to mow my yard. My dad was out of state for work at the time, my mom was doing laundry, and I was in my room watching YouTube. I had my AirPods in both ears, but I still heard my dogs barking at something outside. My dogs are the type to bark at just about anything, so I figured they were just barking at someone walking on the street or the mail had gotten delivered. I didn't think anything of it until I heard my neighbors lawn mower. I found this weird because he had just mowed earlier that day (as in finished about 10 minutes ago). 

My dogs would not stop barking, so I went into the living room to look out the window to see what they are barking at, and then I saw my neighbor on my yard mowing. I yelled to my mom that the neighbor was in our yard, and both of us went outside where my mom yelled at him to get out of our yard. This is not the first time that a trespasser has been in our yard, but it was the first where it has been just me and my mom. He explained that he had knocked on our door but nobody answered (which explains why my dogs were going crazy). My mom told him to get off our yard or we would call the cops for trespassing. 

He did get off our yard, and I called my dad. I told him everything that had happened and told him that he has offered to mow our yard before (as I was mowing) and I told him no, as I am particular on how it is mowed. He told me that he would call me back, and he proceeded to call the police. my dad told him that the neighbor was trespassing, and that it wasn't the first time.

43,1ekwnku,AITA For going to my niece's birthday party but not my nephew's,"My wife's sister, Deb, has 2 kids (11m & 8F).  Deb and her husband live about a 4-hour drive from us.  My wife doesn't have any other siblings, so she is really close with Deb.  I'm sure it wasn't planned on the part of Deb and her husband, but their kids have birthdays that are 3 weeks apart.  This past weekend was the birthday party for their daughter.  Three weeks from now, it will be their son's birthday party.  

For the past few years, my wife and I have only been attending one of their birthday parties.  We will bring gifts for both the kids and just give them to them both on the same day.  We would alternate whose birthday we would attend every year.  Up until this year, that hasn't been an issue.  Or at least it wasn't enough of an issue for anyone to say anything.  

Apparently now Deb thinks we are playing favorites by only attending one of their birthday parties.  At the birthday party for my niece, we gave presents to both her and her brother like we always have.  I was in the kitchen and Deb came in to ask me if we would be attending her son's party in a few weeks.  I told her that we would not, which is why we brought gifts for both of the kids.  She told me that she would prefer if we came to both parties so that her kids don't think we are favoring one over the other.

I told her that this system works for us because we live too far away to make that drive twice in a month.  She said we are always welcome to stay with them to make things easier. I reminded her that we have a dog and a cat at home and both their kids are allergic (something she reminds us of whenever they come to visit) and that it can be hard for us to find people to watch them.  She suggested getting a hotel and I told her we are not going to spend money on hotels to attend kids' birthday parties.  

She told me that her kids have made comments in the past about us only attending one of their parties.  I told her that it sounds like it's her job to explain to them why we do that, but if she wants me to, I will talk to the kids and remind them that we love and care for them both equally even if we don't attend both birthday parties.

She took offense because she felt I was making a dig at her parenting.  So, I apologized for it coming off that way but reiterated that we are going to continue to attend one party and bring gifts for both kids.  I told her that if she has an issue with that, I will gladly just order gifts off Amazon and have them shipped directly to their house and stay home from both parties altogether.  

Deb must have talked to my wife after that because my wife asked me why Deb called me a jerk.  I explained our conversation to her and she told me that I was too harsh and kind of an AH.  She told me that maybe we can make an effort to attend both kids' parties and I told her that she is 100% free to do that, but I really have no desire to make that drive twice in a month and sacrifice 2 whole weekend days to kids' birthday parties.

44,1ekwhuw,WIBTAH brother’s girlfriend not paying rent.,"Hi y’all. First time posting so be patient with me. 
I’m a 25 y/o male living with my 31 y/o brother. We both moved down to Texas four years ago to be closer to family and go to school. Original we moved into a small three bedroom trailer. While there I was working with a guy building fences that ended up ghosting me because he was a crocked contractor. I quickly got a job in retail and was able to get a stable income, but my brother had to pick up some of the bills. two years later we found a nicer town home closer to family.

My brothers girlfriend age 31 y/o move all her stuff from her place a year into us being at the new place, but was planning on go back to her home state to get need surgery. She would occasionally fly back in for holidays and big events but spent most of her time in her home state with her immediate family. Often she would buy large amounts of food and then leave it for use to figure out what to do with, as we both don’t cook as much as her. She was on government assistance, so I don’t know where the money was coming from.

This is where I might be the a-hole. Originally when she moved her stuff in, I was explained that she would do more house cleaning and other choirs around the house. I agreed to this because I thought it would be a short term situation. I would often come home to her sitting in my brother’s room watching Netflix but occasionally she was cleaning. It has almost be a year now of her being without a job, and I’m starting to think about moving to closer job opportunities, but can’t because my brother doesn’t want to move and his girlfriend isn’t here to pay the rent or help out.

I’ve brought up the idea of moving together but he is admit that he doesn’t want to have to move again.

Would I be the a-hole for leaving my brother with $1700 a month in rent because his girlfriend isn’t here to help out? 


Edit: I know I would be obligated to complete my time thru the lease as expected. The lease ends in 10 days and my brother has no intention on moving elsewhere. I brought up the prospect of moving closer to a bigger town where we both would be closer to work; two months back. I know I can’t force them to move, but I just started back up at 12 hour night shift shifts five days a week. This is relevant because I have to drive a little less than an hour each way.

But last christmas, we each bought our own pc (instead of gifts our parents, grandparents, etc give us money \~£250 total every year). I have mine set up on 2 drawer units in the corner of the room so its out of the way and i can store all the extras effectively.

He said he got in too deep and couldn't just leave her, adding, ""I'm not a monster, just cruel."" This made me think I had to break them up. I warned him that I would send screenshots to her because I had promised to tell her if he talked about her behind her back.

When I sent the screenshots, he got angry, and we argued. He admitted that she was his last resort to forget about his other ex. Hearing that, I felt justified in sending the screenshots and told him that she can't be just a method to get over someone else. Now, he's mad and won't speak to me.

48,1ekvwr7,AITA for staying at the Sphere while friend had bad trip,"This past weekend, my friend and I traveled to the sphere from the East Coast. For those of you don’t know this is a concert venue with incredible sound, and visuals.

We were seeing dead and company and naturally in the scene people smoke pot and take psychedelics.

My friend, and I both decided that we would take a dose of acid. We’ve all tripped multiple times and know what it feels like both good and when things are going south.

Suddenly, during the second song, my friend grabs me and says I need to leave right now we need to go. I told her it’s gonna be OK and she should sit down and have some water but then in a second she said I need to go and ran off.

For context, I have a broken ankle and went to the show handicapped with her being my pseudo escort. 

End of the story is that I stayed at the sphere and enjoyed my time, but she went back home and Uber to the Airbnb.

As soon as she left, I sent a message and checked on her and also gave her the ticket in case she wanted to go for a walk and return. Needless to say that did not happen and she went home.

Today after we returned to Vegas, she sent me a long text saying she was upset that I didn’t come with her. I sunk so much money into the trip and wanted to stay for why we flew to Vegas.

i’ve never rolled me eyes so hard before. as i was looking at the video i accidentally swiped and swiped back to the video but in that brief swipe i saw something that looked like my handwriting so i went back to look and saw it was pictures of my journal and my private thoughts. i asked my stepfather why he had a picture of it and he said he was offended by what was inside. i told him he shouldn’t have looking inside my journal. he tried to argue back saying i shouldn’t have wrote he was childish and stupid. i was so baffled so i asked him again what right does he have to open my journal then take pictures then he said since it was in the kitchen it was private anymore. i told him he’s just proven how childish and stupid he is because why would he look in my private journal and take a picture. he kept repeating himself so i told him im not going to talk to him again. you invaded my privacy. i don’t care if my journal is on the ceiling it was in a closed book that you knew belonged to me yet you disrespected me by reading it and taking a picture. i said in front of him and my mother im not speaking to him till im ready. it’s been two weeks so far and he gave me a half ass apology last week saying “i’m wrong for invading your privacy but why did you have to call me names” i rolled my eyes and said why did he have to read my diary. till this day im waiting for an answer. he has said to my mother he doesn’t like me ignoring him. i don’t necessarily feel bad but if im in the wrong ill take accountability because all my decisions so far have been based on my emotions.

50,1ekvqim,AITA for being major mad at a minor comment?,"My bf and I went to a concert together, multiple things added up which lead to me going nuclear at a simple comment. He is sure that no one would understand my over the top reaction and I think that other people might 'agree'. Let's find out
 
I generally think that his screentime is too much. Aka first thing in the morning scrolling through instagram etc, while I think it's healthy to leave the smartphone for the first hour of the day alone (if it's possible). Watching YouTube when using the public transition instead of talking to me. Using the smartphone while merely pissing. Yeah it's his decision, but it's annoying me because mental hygiene is important to me and stuff like this makes you a lil stupid and inattentive.
Back to the concert, he took the smartphone out and started recording the best moments instead of just taking in the moment. Also, I felt like I went to the concert along because he didn't allow my existence once when we were there..Like a simple arm around me shoulders or just a comment to me about the show or something. (We had seats, it wasn't a situation in which taking would be out of it)
Because of the mass of visitors, mobile network wasnt reachable and he checked and checked when it's finally back instead of just leaving it be. When it was time to take the train back home, I told him hurry up , this is our connection, I know our route. First thing he does in train is to take out his smartphone to make sure the route I just told him is correct. To me this just seemed to be another excuse to be on the phone, after all I know my city and just told him our route. So I told him something along the line of 'What? Why do you need to check the route, don't you trust me?"" Which really annoyed and irritated him, which lead to the foreshadowed comment that ended up in a big fight between us: on the next transfer station,  I asked him to check for the route again so that we can see the waiting time for our next connection and maybe decide on a better route depending on it. He felt snarky and told me 'I thought you had everything under control?' I said 'I obviously do, that's why I'm navigating us to the best route possible' after that, there was a strange mood between us and silence, it was clear we were annoyed with each other, that some things needed to be resolved. But all the time waiting for the next train, he said nothing, he just went back to his phone.

When we arrived back home he wanted to cuddle and resolve but I couldn't have it. I told him if it's more important to him to be on the phone all this time on the way back home instead of lighting the mood, he doesn't need to do so now that's it's convenient and that too much time has passed, I'm fed up by now. It escalated by me wanting to be left alone and him considering leaving home.

52,1ekvg2e,WIBTA if I buy a house without telling my friend,"I've (25m) had a Help to Buy ISA for a few years now, and recently started looking to buy my first house. My friend(22m) lives in a council house and is looking to move. 

My plan has always been to get at least a 2 bedroom house and advertise for a lodger. I suggested my friend could lodge with me. One way or another I'd be taking in a lodger but thought it would be nice fir it to be a friend. We were discussing it then his partner suggested we get a joined mortgage. 

I kind of quietened down then. Looking on spare room websites lodgers are willing to pay more than half of what my mortgage would cost. As they are my friends I'd offer them to stay as a couple, paying the same as one lodger would pay for the room. But I'm not willing to go in for a joined mortgage with anyone. 

The way a joined mortgage would be for me in this case, I'd be putting in most of the deposit. I'd be paying more per month and I'd end up with less at the end, only owning half the house. That and complications, if one wanted to sell and one wanted to continue living in it. 

I understand where they coming from. The council are unlikely to put them out ever, if I buy a place and wanted to sell later, well any logers would also need to leave. On the other hand they'd be living in a bigger house and I wouldn't be planning to sell any time soon. So they'd have ups and downs with lodging with me. But I don't want a joined mortgage with anyone.

I think the best thing I can do  is just not talk about any of this again to them until I find a place I want to buy, get an offer accepted, get a mortgage in my name alone and own it. Then I can offer again if they'd like to lodge with me or should I start messaging people on Spare Room.

I told him referring to gay people that way was bigoted and I was embarrassed that my father would say things like that knowing I was a part of the community.

He says it’s not bigoted and that a gay journalist coined the term, which I will research when I have the time, but I find the way he used the phrase to be mocking.

We’re getting married in the middle of a meadow towards the center of their property and it’s going to be gorgeous.

I’m not close with Sarah because they live across the state and only come down here for holidays and events. 

Sarah uses a prosthetic leg and apparently lately it’s been getting to be too much for her so she’s been using a wheelchair. He texted me asking if the property was wheelchair accessible and d I said I didn’t know and would let him know what I found out. There aren’t any stairs but the property has different sections with grass, cobblestone, gravel, and dirt and since I don’t use a wheelchair i don’t know how well they are at getting around in terrain like that. 

We went over to my in-laws to go over the ceremony and reception space and see how difficult it might be for Sarah. I texted my brother to let him know about the terrain. He asked if the reception was in the house and I said no, we were having a tent set up. He asked if we were putting that party tent flooring down and I said no. We looked in to it but it was out of our budget and everything will look nicer in the grass anyways. 

He asked if we would have one set up anyways because the grass would be too hard for Sarah to wheel over and I apologized and told him it was out of our budget by thousands. He told me that if we wouldn’t do that Sarah couldn’t come and we’d be excluding her. I said that it was unfortunate and if that was the case we’d miss her at our wedding. He called me ableist and discriminatory and said that if we wouldn’t accommodate her then he wouldn’t come to our wedding either. 

Not even a goddam hour later I got a text from my mom saying that I was being mean to my brother and Sarah and that it wouldn’t be a good look for me if I “decided not to do such a simple thing”. She told me that I could handle renting one of those tent patios since we didn’t pay for a venue and DIYd a lot of our wedding. 

I said I was sorry and gave my reasoning again. She told me that if we excluded Sarah they’d pull their contribution to our wedding. I’m not sure how exactly since they paid for our dresses and those were paid for weeks ago. I told her that if her and my brother wanted to foot the but that I’d be more than happy to speak to my MIL about having one put down. She said no. Her and dad are retired and Justin has his own wedding to pay for. 

I feel bad for excluding Sarah but I’m not sure what else I can do. AITAH? 

Edit to add info. Sarah has used a prosthetic since she’s been with my brother BUT this is the first and only time they’ve mentioned her being in a wheelchair. We sent out save the dates with my MILs address as the venue about 8 months ago and 2 months ago sent out formal invitations with more information regarding her property (parking, outdoors, length of walk to ceremony etc) and I hadn’t heard anything from my brother or Sarah besides a returned rsvp for yes. 

Edit 2. The quotes we were given for something that we were sure wouldn’t harm my MILS lawn was about $6,000 to $9,000 to rent for the evening. Our budget was $15,000 and we are already at the top end of it. 

Edit 3. The reason I didn’t suggest or look into a different kind of chair or scooter was because I just figured that that was something Sarah and Justin would have looked into themselves since they were the ones needing it. I figured since they jumped right to a $9,000 solution at my pocket that the other options wouldn’t work for them and they were bringing up the last available option. Also my fiancés grandma is wheelchair bound as well but has been to my MILs house plenty of times and it hasn’t come up as an issue. 
And for everyone upset about us getting married in grass and that people will struggle with their heels, I said in my post that in our invitations we had information about my MILs property.

58,1ekuon3,AITA for calling out my ex best friend for ignoring me?,"I (17F) recently started at a new school and became friends with Katie (16F) who sat in front of me. Katie had a best friend, Brittany (16F), but they had a falling out, so Katie and I became very close. My old friends warned me that Katie was two-faced, but I didn't believe them. Katie spent a lot of time at my place, and we even planned a trip to Italy with my family.

After reconciling with Brittany in February, Katie started acting distant and sometimes ignored me. This made me confused and hurt. I asked her to talk about it, and after some hesitation, she finally agreed. She apologized and said it was unusual for her to get so close to someone so quickly, but assured me it wouldn’t happen again. I felt relieved, thinking our friendship was back to normal.

During class trips, Katie often ignored me again, but Brittany and her group (Katie and two boys) surprised me by inviting me to join them. I declined because I didn't want to feel like a fifth wheel. Around my birthday, Katie slept over, but the conversation was awkward. She suggested I should reconnect with my old friends, though I was still close to them.

On my birthday, Katie, the two boys, and I had a good time, and Katie confirmed she was excited about the Italy trip. On another class trip, Katie failed to inform Brittany about rooming with me, causing confusion. We ended up rooming together, and Brittany's group seemed to appreciate my presence, even inviting me out after the trip. However, they acted differently when we returned home.

I asked Katie if I did something wrong, and she blew up, saying she was happy with her current friend group and didn’t come to the new school to make new best friends. She suggested we stop talking and that I should go back to my old friends. I felt hurt and confused, wondering why she didn't value our friendship.

Since then, summer holiday started, and I’ve talked to a few friends about the situation. They mostly agreed with each other, but I felt the need for unbiased opinions. I feel like I was always the second choice and wonder if my feelings are justified. Was it wrong for me to be upset about how things turned out with Katie?

59,1ekum0z,AITA for my reaction to a break up,"AITA for the way I reacted to a break up

I, (mid 20sF) and my now ex partner, (early 20sM, henceforth referred to as G) were together for two years. We recently had a breakup that’s been very hard on me, and has me questioning my place in it.

 I’d like to preface all of this by saying that I am by no means perfect. I had a difficult childhood and some unresolved/ partially resolved trauma from my first year of college. To say that these things are not effectual in a relationship is a lie. I’ve always been upfront about those issues with any romantic interest, and try to mitigate any unhealthy habits while being as communicative and open as possible. I am not always successful, and sometimes stress turns to negativity, frustration, and depression, but I do try. Most people who know me consider me kind to a fault, but I have my own issues.

Back to the story: We met through a mutual sport in college. We had many of the same outdoor interests and goals, and some good mutual friends as well. As G and I became closer and started to approach the idea of dating, I got into a bad accident. He came to take care of me without question and never left. Everything was so amazing and so natural from the beginning, and even as things got more difficult past the honeymoon stage, we maintained a mature, communicative relationship, and grew and learned together whenever we failed. Our “arguments” never really turned into arguments- they were just brief disagreements that we discussed wholly and respectfully and moved forward. We each adopted a dog during the relationship as well, and they were best friends. Puppies present challenges and stresses of their own, but they grew up and so did we. I thought that we had finally built something safe and wonderful, because he had started to mention the idea of marriage to me.

His parents were the primary point of tension in our relationship. My parents accepted him right away, and loved him quickly. His parents did not approve of me due to my financial situation and political beliefs, as well as the trauma of my past. His mother suggested not even a month into the relationship that I was planning to accuse my partner of something for financial gain after he told her about my past (against my wishes). I forgave him for breaking my confidence, but the damage was done, as his mother had already branded me a liar and a user. I did not and do not trust his family. 

For financial context, my family is not wealthy, so I paid my own way through school without loans, and that took some doing, so I graduated a couple of years late and I am older than a lot of my university friends. Gs parents are quite wealthy as I discovered a month into our relationship, and his tuition, housing, car, bills, etc are paid for by his parents, in addition to a $500+ monthly allowance. He and I stayed primarily at my place, and I continued to pay rent, utilities, groceries, etc. while he chipped in on the groceries. We didn't go on many dates or travel much- we mostly went camping and hiking or just to get tacos and beer, because those are all my favorite things. His family is pretty materialistic and tends to try to fix things with money, and he's lamented to me several times that his parents don't love and respect each other the way we do because they're so consumed with the idea of money. 

At the time, G fought tooth and nail for me and our relationship, but his family had no desire to get to know me, so they continued to confirm their own biases. I desperately wanted them to like me, and a few times I thought we had turned a corner, but they always had something negative to say about me after every interaction, no matter how mindful I was. “She’s too quiet. Too standoffish. Stuck up. Too opinionated. Ungrateful.” etc. They were convinced I had some ulterior motive.

Fast forward to this summer- I convinced G that he should take an excellent opportunity to work for his father for the summer (about 3 hours from our college town) I knew it would be hard on us because of his family, and it wasn’t really what I wanted, but I thought he would enjoy and learn from it. Before he actually left, I did cry and beg him not to go. I had this overwhelming sinking feeling in my heart I couldn’t explain, but he did still go as I assumed he would. The distance was hard, but he visited a few weekends and we always had a good reunion and a tearful goodbye. During this time, I had agreed to keep his dog for him while he was gone. She was sort of a problem dog and an escape artist, so this was not an easy task, but I loved him and the dog, so I dealt with it.

Fast forward a little more, to about a week ago. He and I were on the phone having a pretty standard conversation, and he used the word “doubt” in reference to our relationship. I pressed for some answers on where this was coming from, and he said he had been thinking about wanting to be single. Obviously after 2 years, I knew that likely wasn’t the underlying issue, but it was really all I could pull out of him. During that conversation, I noticed sort of a flipping switch. One minute he was cold and monotonous and unfeeling, and the next right back to himself. I told him I thought it would be a good idea if he came back to talk about some things. The next morning before he headed my way, he called me to say he wasn’t breaking up with me and didn’t want to live without me, and apologized for everything. He was back for a day and a half, and after a lot of heartbreaking discussion, we had decided to work on it together and go to counseling. He assured me during this that I hadn't done anything wrong or treated him badly or unkindly, and apologized many times for hurting me. During the conversation, I did ascertain some issues he hadn’t been speaking to me about, and we talked those things through (me feeling too distant and distracted over the phone and feeling like roommates were at the top of the list). I told him that I could make peace with us separating if that’s what it came to, but I really wanted to work on it together, because I thought the unmentioned issues were the problem. Before he left, I asked that we not have big conversations like that over the phone again. It made me feel unimportant and disrespected in our relationship that he had initiated all of this over the phone. He promised me then that he would never do that again. 

Two days later, he called me to break up with me. He was cold and unfeeling during the conversation, and the combination of his actions and his tone made me question who I was even speaking to. He’s usually so emotional and sensitive himself. I felt hurt and disrespected. I don’t recall all of the content of the conversation. I know I was angry and devastated, and I know I called him selfish at some point in it, but mostly I was speaking in between sobs and asking for answers. He didn’t even seem upset about the breakup or about me being hurt- he was just upset with my reaction. I got overwhelmed about 5 minutes into the call and ended it. He refused to speak over the phone afterwards. 

Two days after that, I texted and asked that he pick up his things over the weekend. It was hurting me so much to look at all of it… He also told me during this time that he did not intend to keep the dog he adopted. G was planning to pick her up and put her directly in a shelter. I told him that I would keep her since he didn't want her- I would never stick her back in a shelter. I only asked if he could keep her for a few days so I could go visit my parents and have a little bit of healing time. He told me this would infringe on his responsibilities, but I had hoped he would change his mind because he loved me and his dog, and because I kept her for him all summer.

 I also told him over text that I didn’t want any gifts back except for one: my dad gave him an axe not long ago as a kind of symbol of acceptance  into our family (we’re an outdoor, farm-raised family, so while strange, this gift had sentimental value), so both my dad and I wanted him to return it after he had handled everything so coldly. I offered to exchange it for a similar gift his parents gave me (the only gift they'd ever given me, other than a mug). He told me that his mom wasn't an Indian giver like we clearly were, and I could keep it. I packed the gift into his things anyways because I wanted to be fair and wasn't trying to be petty, but I didn't want him to keep something so sentimental and specific to my family. There were $100s of dollars in other items my family and I gave him that I did not ask him to return.

He showed up to get his things with his mother in the car. I did not have a heads up that she would be coming to my house, so as soon as I saw her I started crying and turned away. I wanted to hug and cry and apologize and get some closure from someone I had loved for so long, but I was very uncomfortable with his mother there and he was still being very cold. He told me there was no room for discussion regarding his dog- I could either take some money and keep her, or he could drop her at a shelter, but he would not keep her for 2 days. I mentioned that I had sacrificed a lot of my summer to care for her, and only wanted a couple of days to stay with my mom. He told me not to speak to him about sacrifice after all he’s done for me. I realized then that the conversation wasn’t going to go anywhere or be healing in anyway, so I started to take his things to the car, and when I looked up, I realized his mother was filming me. To set the scene, it was raining, and I had been sobbing almost too hard to speak since they arrived. I asked her if she was filming me and asked why- she said of course she was filming me for her son’s protection. He followed that up and said that I had been angry and aggressive in my response to the break up, and his mom had a right to film me if she felt like it. 
The idea that after two years either of them could think he needed to be protected from me just broke my heart a little more (I’m 100 pounds soaking wet, and very non confrontational). I asked him why he wanted it to be this way when we could’ve been there for each other and broken up amicably. I told him that our friends and I and my family were all so confused and disappointed and I begged for an explanation again. He just said “our friends suck anyways.” As he left, I was on my knees crying in my driveway in the rain and I told him that I never wanted to see him or his mom again. He told me that would be his pleasure. 

I feel hurt and confused and lied to- it’s like it came out of nowhere for no reason, and the way he handled it has made me question our entire relationship. It all feels like wasted time- all of this over just wanting to be single again. All of our friends and my family are on my side, and quite disappointed in him. But from his perspective, he thinks that my reactions to all of this are the “real me” (too angry, over emotional, petty, etc), and now I’m wondering what I should’ve changed. I’ve never had a breakup like this before. They’ve always been devastating, but my other exs and I have treated each other very kindly, and had tearful goodbyes and cordial friendships in the aftermath. I haven’t really had to react to an emotional rollercoaster like this before, and Im thinking calling him selfish and being angry were over the top reactions. I haven't really slept since all this started a week ago- I'm exhausted and confused and doubting myself.

Two days after that, I texted and asked that he pick up his things over the weekend. It was hurting me so much to look at all of it… He also told me during this time that he did not intend to keep the dog he adopted. G was planning to pick her up and put her directly in a shelter. I told him that I would keep her since he didn't want her- I would never stick her back in a shelter. I only asked if he could keep her for a few days so I could go visit my parents and have a little bit of healing time. He told me this would infringe on his responsibilities, but I had hoped he would change his mind because he loved me and his dog, and because I kept her for him all summer.

 I also told him over text that I didn’t want any gifts back except for one: my dad gave him an axe not long ago as a kind of symbol of acceptance  into our family (we’re an outdoor, farm-raised family, so while strange, this gift had sentimental value), so both my dad and I wanted him to return it after he had handled everything so coldly. I offered to exchange it for a similar gift his parents gave me (the only gift they'd ever given me, other than a mug). He told me that his mom wasn't an Indian giver like we clearly were, and I could keep it. I packed the gift into his things anyways because I wanted to be fair and wasn't trying to be petty, but I didn't want him to keep something so sentimental and specific to my family. There were $100s of dollars in other items my family and I gave him that I did not ask him to return.

He showed up to get his things with his mother in the car. I did not have a heads up that she would be coming to my house, so as soon as I saw her I started crying and turned away. I wanted to hug and cry and apologize and get some closure from someone I had loved for so long, but I was very uncomfortable with his mother there and he was still being very cold. He told me there was no room for discussion regarding his dog- I could either take some money and keep her, or he could drop her at a shelter, but he would not keep her for 2 days. I mentioned that I had sacrificed a lot of my summer to care for her, and only wanted a couple of days to stay with my mom. He told me not to speak to him about sacrifice after all he’s done for me. I realized then that the conversation wasn’t going to go anywhere or be healing in anyway, so I started to take his things to the car, and when I looked up, I realized his mother was filming me. To set the scene, it was raining, and I had been sobbing almost too hard to speak since they arrived. I asked her if she was filming me and asked why- she said of course she was filming me for her son’s protection. He followed that up and said that I had been angry and aggressive in my response to the break up, and his mom had a right to film me if she felt like it. 
The idea that after two years either of them could think he needed to be protected from me just broke my heart a little more (I’m 100 pounds soaking wet, and very non confrontational). I asked him why he wanted it to be this way when we could’ve been there for each other and broken up amicably. I told him that our friends and I and my family were all so confused and disappointed and I begged for an explanation again. He just said “our friends suck anyways.” As he left, I was on my knees crying in my driveway in the rain and I told him that I never wanted to see him or his mom again. He told me that would be his pleasure. 

I feel hurt and confused and lied to- it’s like it came out of nowhere for no reason, and the way he handled it has made me question our entire relationship. It all feels like wasted time- all of this over just wanting to be single again. All of our friends and my family are on my side, and quite disappointed in him. But from his perspective, he thinks that my reactions to all of this are the “real me” (too angry, over emotional, petty, etc), and now I’m wondering what I should’ve changed. I’ve never had a breakup like this before. They’ve always been devastating, but my other exs and I have treated each other very kindly, and had tearful goodbyes and cordial friendships in the aftermath. I haven’t really had to react to an emotional rollercoaster like this before, and Im thinking calling him selfish and being angry were over the top reactions. I haven't really slept since all this started a week ago- I'm exhausted and confused and doubting myself. So, Reddit, AITA for the way I reacted to this break up?",,1.040972352027893,1,0
60,1ekubyv,AITA for not visiting elderly aunt and uncle after purposely being excluded from uncles birthday,"First time poster here. A little back story: 
I (36F) am a single mom and have 2 children (6M and 5F), we live with my 2 parents and all moved together to be closer to my dads family in NB Canada (about 12 hours away from where I was born and raised). 
We always have aunt Edith uncle Peter and their adults kids and their families over for suppers and family gatherings and in turn we’re always invited over to their place for holidays and various types of gatherings. We have other family that lives here as well. About 2 months ago there was a huge family gathering at aunt Edith and uncle Peters house for one of my other uncle Travis who has a very aggressive cancer. So all the adults and (aunts and uncles) and adult kids were invited. Myself my kids and my cousin (32F)-aunt Edith and uncle Peter are her grandparents, her husband (33M) and their two children (4F and 2F) were not invited. Aunt Edith says we weren’t invited because she thought the noise would get to uncle Travis and him being sick he probably wouldn’t want to hear the noise of the children. Fine I get that, my kids are pretty well behaved but are still just kids so I was ok with that. My cousin was a little put off that we weren’t invited but I never heard her mention it again. There was another gathering in May for aunt Edith’s birthday which we were all invited to. Everything went well, my kids made a bit of the mess on the floor with the cake which I promptly picked up, I cleaned up all the toys all the kids played with. 
Now fast forward to July 20, it was my uncle Peter’s birthday party. The whole family was invited. Aunt Edith and Uncle Peter’s adult kids and their families and my cousin with her husband and little ones and my parents were also invited. Myself and my kids were not. My parents did not know that the whole family had been invited except for me and kids. One of aunt Edith’s and Uncle Peter’s kids had asked where I was and my parents said I wasn’t invited. So later at the party my aunt Edith pulls my parents aside and says I wasn’t invited because she (aunt Edith) always has to pick up after my kids after I leave. Which is a total crock because I clean up after them if they make a mess and my kids help. I’m not one to leave my kids mess for someone else to clean up. So after hearing this of course I’m pissed off and not wanting to visit with them. I’m wondering if I would be an a*****e for not going to their place anymore to visit if they invite me back. With Thanksgiving and Christmas coming up I’m thinking they’ll invite us over like they do every year and now I just don’t want to go. Not only would be self conscious about missing anything on the floor when I clean up but now it would feel like a pity invite. And I really don’t want to go knowing what I know now.

63,1ektemh,AITA For checking my blood glucose in front of my coworker?,"Hello, I (34,f) work in a group home for people who require in home assistance. I have type 1 diabetes, which requires me to manually administer my own insulin as well as closely monitor my blood glucose. I check my blood glucose in multiple ways, such as 1) using an app on my phone that receives data from a sensor I put on my arm 2) manually scanning my arm sensor with my phone if the app isn't updating or if my phone is out of range of my arm sensor, and 3) doing a blood test (I do this far less than the other methods). 

I have a coworker, L (50,f), who I work with 5 days a week. L has always been a bit invasive about my diabetes, claiming that she is interested in diabetes and that she knows a lot about it (she has a husband with type 2 diabetes and 2 cats who are diabetic). I have had to go outside of what I find comfortable to lay down some boundaries about her and being invasive about my diabetes. She has not taken to my boundaries very well, and continues to ask invasive questions. 

Recently, while I was at work, I manually scanned my arm sensor with my phone to get an updated reading of my blood glucose. I do this fairly regularly. L was near me as I did this, and asked me if I was OK, as she always does when she sees me scan my sensor. 

I told L that yes, I am ok and that she does not need to worry about me or ask me if I am OK whenever she sees me scan my sensor, that I will let her know if my blood glucose is low or if I am feeling unwell. L said that she only asks because she's a very caring person, and that she's concerned about me, but if that's how I feel she will ""never ever ask me how I am feeling ever again"". She obviously did not actually mean that, as she has still been asking me if I am OK when she sees me check my blood glucose. 

Here is where I might be the AH. L approached me a day after this interaction and told me that she thought I had been extremely rude to her, and that she only asks if I am OK because she is a caring individual. I told her that my blood glucose and how I'm feeling isn't really any of her business, and restated to her why I sometimes manually scan my arm sensor. L laughed sarcastically at me and said  ""wow... that is some response. So rude."" Again, I told her I dont think I'm being rude, I think she's being invasive. To this she told me that if I don't want her to ask me how I am feeling when she sees me scan my sensor, that I shouldn't scan in front of her anymore. I was a bit shocked by this, and it got me a bit riled up. I told her that I was not going to do that, that I need to keep a pretty constant eye on my glucose levels, especially at work. Again, she laughed sarcastically at me and said that I should check my glucose level when I am not around her. I told her that no, that doesn't work for me and that I was going to continue to scan and check my glucose levels regardless of her proximity to me.

64,1ekstd3,AITA for sneaking out and leaving my mom's kids alone to hang out with friends?,"Hi everyone,

I (17F) am in a tough situation and need some perspective. My parents are divorced, and I spend time at both my mom’s and dad’s houses. At my mom’s, I have a stepdad and three younger step-siblings (4, 7, and 12).

Whenever I’m at my mom’s, I’m expected to babysit my siblings. It happens every single time. I’ve told my mom multiple times that I don’t want to babysit and that I need time to hang out with my friends, do school work, or just have some personal time. She doesn’t listen and forces me to babysit anyway.

I got fed up with it and came up with a plan. Since my 12-year-old sibling is pretty responsible, I decided to sneak out the back door after my mom and stepdad left. I figured the 12-year-old could handle things for a couple of hours while I hung out with my friends. 

This plan worked for a few times, but then my mom came home early one day and found out I wasn’t there. She went insane, yelling at me and saying I was irresponsible and put my siblings in danger. She even called my dad to complain about it, which made things even worse for me.

Now, my mom is saying I’m grounded and that I can’t be trusted. My dad is upset with my mother, as he understands my side a bit more. I’m feeling really stuck because I just want some freedom and not to be forced into being a babysitter every time I’m at my mom’s.

So, AITA for sneaking out and leaving my siblings alone?

I’ve tried in the past and she threatened my dad she would take it to court so now I just go over every other week. Once im 18, I do plan on only staying at dads though. For context, I just turned 17 so i have about a year or so left. 

2nd EDIT: Since everyone is a little confused. Yes the kids I’m babysitting are my step siblings. I don’t dislike them, they’re pleasant to be around but it’s not easy or really my responsibility to look after 3 near strangers all the time. My parents divorced when I was 14 so I was not in their lives at all. I call him my stepdad but my mom and him aren’t legally married, they just live together right now.

I basically said we cannot because we have to pick up the baby. My partner said that was not very generous and we should have helped him out. AITA?

Other info that may be helpful: this person is a grown adult who lives on his own and has money and the ability to get an uber. He is aware we have a toddler. He has been friends with my partner a long time. We did not give him a ride to the venue. He carpooled with a group of people and left his car at the mall where they all met beforehand. There were other people who could give him a ride although their detours would have been longer but none of the others had a kid to pick up (although I still don't think they should have had to adjust so last minute either)",0.0,0.045459117740392685,0,1
66,1eksrjh,WIBTA if I decide not to move into my aunts Appartement last minute?,"I 24 F had planned to move into my aunts (60iesF)  Appartement in Vienna as I have just finished my studies and am now looking to work in Vienna. She offered me to live there for pretty cheap in spring as she was using the apartment as an Airbnb and was looking to change that anyway, otherwise I would have looked for Appartements myself. The Appartement is a small Studio Appartement and very nice.

Today she told me that my cousin would stay there a few times a month and I would have to leave during that time. (so around 2-3 days a month) I have pretty bad mental health issues (avpd, depression, anxiety) and the thought of that really stresses me out. I feel like I wouldn’t be at home anywhere in that case (During the time my cousin is there I can go to my parents house 2 hours away) The thing is though that a few weeks ago she told me that I could live there for free till the end of the year so I don’t have to stress with job searching. She is obviously extremely generous and I’m really grateful, but I’m just not sure I can do that. WIBTA if I decide not to move in and instead look for an Appartement elsewhere? I would be moving in in 2 days, but for now I could also stay at my parents house and look for an Appartement myself.

I feel like I would be the asshole because she is super generous and I will come across as extremely ungrateful and that I’m being unreasonable not being okay with this.

Small UPDATE

I talked to my parents they are also unsure what to do. I think I will move anyway and cope until I can find an Appartement that’s actually my own. But to me that means still mostly living with my parents (feeling wise anyway) because the space won’t really be mine at all and at my parents house I have a space that’s only mine (though ofc my parents are able to walk in anytime, but they are fairly respectful). Though the main reason I wanted to move out of my parents house was because I wanted more privacy so it’s def not perfect. I have mainly decided to go in this direction because I have a really good relationship with my aunt and really don’t want to destroy that.

67,1eksrhx,AITA for not spoiling a story for my sister?,"SPOILER FOR SCHOOL BUS GRAVEYARD

For a teensy bit of background, me and my sister both read Webtoon and I recently got her into School Bus Graveyard. In the most recent not fast pass episode it is revealed right at the end that Ashley’s dad (and presumably Mum too) is in the Phantom world. 

My sister was binge reading SBG but because she has pretty tight time restrictions on her phone, (due to her past actions) a few panels before the end part was revealed, her time went up and she couldn’t finish the last part of the episode. She came into me to talk about it and mentioned that she didnt get to finish the episode. I remarked that was unfortunate because there was a plot relevant bit of information at the end. She asked what it was and I said i didn’t really want to spoil what it was because it was always better off read and i just thought it would hit harder when u read it and realise what it entails for the future of the story. She then started nagging me about what it was and i continued to refuse to tell her for the same reasons i already listed. She then started takking about how i was putting her through hell and that she needed to know what happened. She was being completely serious too. 

The thing is, its currently 7:30pm where i am, and her time unlocks tomorrow at 11am. That is not a long time to wait for the last few panels of a webtoon story. My sister is a generally impatient person but she became especially snarky and rude to me when i wouldn’t spoil it for her. Eventually she left my room and we are right next to eachother. I heard her crying and saying to herself that she “just wanted to know”. I don’t know of i’m being insensitive but not having a small part of an online story not being spoiled and having to wait till tomorrow morning to know is not something to cry about? I wasn’t being rude or abrasive, she had a terrible attitude to me and it sounded like she was on the verge of insulting me (she does this often during arguments). I know sometimes little things can build up and a small thing can cause much bigger feelings, but we are on vacation and she has been having a pretty good time. Today was good too, so i don’t really think it is a large amount of pent up feelings coming out. If i had known how this would have turned out i wouldnt have mentioned that the ending had a revelation at all but i didn’t realise she would be this upset over me not wanting to spoil it. 

This seems like such a small situation and i didn’t doubt my feelings at first but now she is in a bad mood and i’m not sure if i should have just spoiled it for her. AITA?

69,1ekspmo,AITA for disturbing my neighbours with music?,"I moved into my current flat about a year ago with a couple of flatmates. I brought a turntable and a pair of speakers from my previous place and set them up in my room. The speakers are a pair of 6x10x10"" desktop models. They're set up on a shelf that sits above floor-level, next to my desk.

To start with I was playing music at around 40-50%, but the downstairs neighbours knocked on our door a couple of times (in the evening) to ask me to turn it down. I hadn't had such problems at my last place, but I figured this building had worse sound insulation, especially since I could hear them talking sometimes at 2am. So I brought it down to around 20% and we had no other problems. This was several months ago – actually the last time that I've interacted with them. (It's not a very friendly building.)

However, they've recently been banging on the ceiling every time I play a record. This happens at noon as much as at 9pm or 10am. The music I play is not bass-heavy or particularly grating, and it's still at 20% volume. This is not the kind of thing I can feel shaking the floor, and (to me at least) it seems like a very reasonable level. They haven't actually tried to talk to me about it, just knocking hard on the ceiling every 10 minutes.

I'm honestly starting to think someone else must have moved in below us without me noticing – someone who's a *lot* more sensitive to noise. Should I go talk to them about it? I'm not really willing to drop it down any lower unless they've got, like, a newborn baby directly under my room. If I make the music any quieter I'll barely be able to hear it.

My (F) bff “Ann”(F) can be a bit much. She is always asking a bunch of questions. If you tell her you will call her later, she wants to know why you can’t talk now. She’s the type to interrogate the waiter about a dish then ask for several modifications. She knows people don’t like it but uses the excuse she is detailed oriented by trade (analytics). She has a good heart so I just deal with it.

  
This past Friday I asked Ann if she wanted to go to lunch. She said she was waiting to hear back from her aunt who needed some help. I responded to take care of Auntie and I’ll see her at another time. I mentioned I would call “Lydia”. I thought that was the end of that. Lydia had plans so I went out with my friend “Mike”.

  
By mid-afternoon, Ann called and texted several times. Her plans fell thru, she couldn’t get in contact with me so she called Lydia and another friend to find out where I was; they didn’t know so she just kept texting me. When I saw the messages I let her know I was with Mike and his friends and I would call her later.

  
Ann continued to call and text me several more times.  All throughout the evening, she was asking where was I, which of Mike’s friends were there, how long was I going to be out, did I have dinner also, etc. This was extreme even for her. I didn’t see these additional texts until after I got home.   
As I was reading her texts, she calls again. I text her back that I just got home, I was tired and tipsy and we will talk the next day.  After I got out the shower I saw she had called me again! It was after midnight, I didn’t call back.

  
Ann called and woke me up at 7:30 in the morning. She immediately asks me what happened the day before. I thought she was trying to be funny so I told her I had a headache and I would call her later. She kept talking, asking me where I went and I kept telling her my head hurts and I was going back to bed. I hung up as she was still talking.

  
She immediately calls me back and says I hurt her feelings. She asked why didn’t I wait to see if she could go to lunch. She just.kept.talking.

When I started stripping, it helped me understand her industry more and how it works and the pros and cons. Given I’d never make as much as she does lol. But when we first got together she had told me she wanted to get out of the club because she respected me so much and she only wanted me to look at her in that way and didn’t want others to see her in that manner. I found it so heart warming and it came out of nowhere. I never would ask her to leave. And it meant the world she was making that decision herself and I wasn’t pressuring her or making her feel bad for being at the club. But that was around 7 months ago and she never left. Which I had accepted and wasn’t mad about. This had come up recently due to her saying she wanted to leave again, but then doesn’t do anything to get out. So I feel like I’m being pulled along. Hoping she’ll leave. Due to context I’m leaving out, I’ve gotten more uncomfortable with her being at the club the longer she’s there. And she knows this. I find her clientele to be disgusting. And the workers disrespectful. I don’t shame her or ever bug her about leaving. I know that would be hard on our relationship. But i just feel like I’m not being respected now. We had a long argument last night about it all and at one point she said the only thing that would motivate her to get out of the club would be if she got pregnant. I told her it hurt my feelings that I now don’t motivate her to get out. Like I had before. And she said she was sorry but couldn’t lie. She said I do motivate her but not yet. In my eyes that felt like “you’re not enough to make me want to get out” She says she wants to leave but then takes more opportunities that involve the club, or being in music videos or whatever that just makes her roots deeper into the club lifestyle. I don’t feel like I’m important enough for her to want to do better. And this is not shaming sex/stripping work. It just, why are you telling me one thing and doing another ? And if I’m uncomfortable with it now wouldn’t you want to do something about that? I feel like shes picking the club over me. Am I an asshole for not wanting her in that life anymore ?

75,1eksgkz,AITA for asking my boyfriend to do something he doesn't enjoy?,"I organised an activity for me (32f) and BF (35m) - an escape room/LARP where you visit a 'town', follow clues and interact with actors to solve quests.

When I asked about it, he said it might not be exactly as it looked in the adverts, but I was still keen to try it out. I was so excited and we talked about it lots in the run up.

On the day BF told me he was having a bad mental health day. I suggested a reschedule - I didn't want to go if he wasn't going to have fun - but he said we should go because we had been planning it for a while, it was unlikely we'd be able to reschedule or refund at this late stage, and he knew how excited I was.

He didn't speak to me much the whole day. In the queue, we spotted a couple that were cosplaying the activity, and he quietly mocked them, calling them 'c-nts'. He snickered at the actors, saying he would spend the day ""trying to p-ss them off"". There were a lot of interactive bits and games and he mostly just stood back saying, ""it's your day, you go do it."" I felt like a little kid who was being chaperoned, rather than a couple doing an activity together. He did try a few things, like a couple of games and doing a dance, but not until after he had told me to do it by myself first and it was obvious how embarrassing it was.

When we got home, I made dinner, let him sit on the sofa and scroll through his phone, gave him a blanket and chocolate and put on his favourite show to cheer him up. But when we went to bed, I couldn't hide my disappointment and started crying. He heard me and asked what was wrong. I told him the day was just not what I hoped for at all - I wanted to do things together, I didn't want him to just follow me around.

He got upset, telling me he tried his best that day despite having a bad mental health day. He said whatever he did was never enough, and I expected the ""perfect day"" which wasn't fair. He said he never wanted to do the activity at all, it was childish and not fun, and I shouldn't expect him to feign enthusiasm for something that he didn't want to do. He said I made him feel like a terrible person.

It was a bit ""kid-friendly"", and as it was a daytime slot there were a few kids. There were also a lot of couples and groups of adults. He didn't express not wanting to do the event, just said it might not live up to my expectations - I never would have forced him to do something he said he didn't want to. I do think there's some expectation when you're in a couple that you do things for/with your partner you wouldn't ordinarily do to support their interests as long as it doesn't make you uncomfortable.

This has turned into a real point of contention now as I have always tried to engage with his interests and show enthusiasm, but he's been clear that he doesn't feel he should be expected to fully participate in things that don't interest him.

I might be the AH because I am expecting too much from my partner in wanting him to engage and participate in things that I like.

Mkay, yes but she still needs to be trained  a small bit for this exposure and he doesn't really see that. 
I've kinda gently said in the roundabout way ""it's either me or the dog when it comes to going places"". I personally don't wanna be reliable incase she does do something and frankly I don't wanna babysit her. He would then get upset and saying ""how is that fair to her"" and so on.

79,1ekseul,AITA for storming out on my husband’s grandmother?,"
I (28F) have always felt like my husband’s family is very judgmental of the way my husband (30M) and I spend our time and money. 

For the most part, the issue with my husband’s grandmother has been her opinions on the relationship I have with my sister. She and I are very close and we do spend a lot of time together. It has never taken away from my relationship with my husband. We have our own things that we do just the two of us, but he also does like my sister and she will hang out with us sometimes as well. He invites her. I know he doesn’t mind. 

His grandmother disagrees.  My husband has told me that she has said from the beginning that she thinks I spend too much time with my sister. Lately, she’s been mentioning it to me as well, and asking me if I think that the time I spend with my sister is taking away from my time with my husband and asking why I always seem to be hanging out with her. Anytime I bring her up the mood instantly changes. 

My sister and I have always been big theme park people, and I have converted my husband since we got married. Universal Studios Orlando is opening a new park next year and my husband and I have decided we would like to go next fall. It was his idea to ask my sister to come along because he knows this is something we have always shared and would like to experience for the first time together. Of course we are going to make time for just the two of us as well. My sister has a friend that lives in that area so she will be able to see her friend and allow my husband and me to have some alone time. She will also have a separate hotel room. 

When my husband’s family found out about this plan, they flipped out. They have never really taken vacations, not that they couldn’t afford to but they just don’t see the point and think it’s a waste of money. The fact that we go on vacation every year or two has already been a point of contention with his family, but they at least appreciated the fact that it gives us some alone time. Now that my sister is coming on our vacation, they’ve really let their feelings out. 

My husband’s grandmother told me that I was being disrespectful to her grandson by allowing  my relationship with my sister to get in the way of my marriage. She told me I was selfish and that I shouldn’t spend so much time with her. I had finally had enough and I told her to mind her own business. I told her that my relationship with my sister has never gotten in the way of my marriage and that it was my husband’s idea to include my sister on this trip. She continued to berate me and make accusations about my treatment of my husband so I walked out of her house and told my husband that I will not be spoken to this way. He is on my side and has tried to convince his grandmother to apologize, but she refused.

She got very upset and it started an argument. She called me a jerk. My friends are split, some thing I should have lied and others think she shouldn’t have asked if she didn’t want an honest answer

Now hear me out, at this stage he was SOBBING, having tears all over his face and snot coming out his nose. I genuinely thought someone has died.
And then, in between tears, he told me that his parents are divorcing, and I couldn't have stopped myself and started laughing, not heavily, but it was bad.

82,1eks73n,AITAH - Joking about my friends behavior after he takes away my safe space and mocking him with my ex - When are you allowed to move on?,"My (26, nb) head has been bringing up a ton of old memories recently, and looking back, I started to notice just how AH-ey I was as a teen.

Back in school, I had a 'friend' circle of vastly different personalities straight out of a cartoon. I won't go into detail, but I had AITAH moments with each of them. Those I wanted to ask about today were a friend I'll call Purple (P) and my ex Ceasar (C).

P was creative, strong minded, rule abiding and a little bossy. Bullied in his school, he transferred to mine in hopes to have a friend group there, where I eventually introduced him to mine. I was not entirely on board with this transfer, it ruined our friendship, and you will see why.

The day he enrolled in my class, the class clown (Mary) approached our table and asked P a few sociable questions. Then she went:

M: ""Are you friends with OP?""  
P: ""Yes.""  
M: ""Then I hate you.""

I'd feel guilty for anyone being affiliated with me and push them away. Purple would stick to the rules, engage in class and always give long answers. I'd hear everyone around snicker or groan each time he lifted his hand. He would also criticize or tell on me for drawing in class, one of the only ways I could concentrate and not have panic attacks. Eventually, I started ignoring his nagging and shut down, not draw, not interact with school at all.

In our friend group, he'd started to be constantly offended. The moron that I was, I thought the right way to handle this was acting constantly easy going and joke about his seriousness.

Obviously, instead of lightening him up, it made him more distant. I decided to leave him be with the others since I made him uncomfortable, and just spent most time alone because of my infallible logic (most befriended me because they were outsiders - now they have friends, they don't need me anymore).

This came back to bite me.

In 9th grade (16 at the time, I'd skipped a class), this new guy Ceasar (18) joined our class. C, unlike me, was actually funny. Classmates would circle him, and he was great at reading the room. We ended up talking one day over an assignment. We soon sent texts back and forth.

Then he asked me to get together, or he'd drop contact. I had never been attracted to anyone, but the idea of loosing someone I could talk to scared me. So I said yes. However, I didn't clearly communicate my boundaries. I would send a lot of mixed signals, which ended up with us doing inappropriate things in various places, including class. He was my partner, but even if he reassured me this is normal for teenagers, I felt weird. I remember hoping that Purple would start criticizing me, so I would have an excuse to stop, which he never did. C also did not know that I was uncomfortable with it.

All this time I feel like I hurt people around me for no reason, miscommunicated, and while wanting to be clear to people I always failed.

83,1ekrxt8,"AITA for declining a housing offer, after i had already accepted it?","A bit of backstory: My (27) father and i had a difficult relationship for a long time. He often got verbally abusive and sometimes physically too. At the age of 16 he kicked me out and after that we were low to no contact.

4 years ago my grandpa had a stroke and to help out i started working in our family business (in which my dad worked too). My dad developed to this time a plan to buy a house in which my grandparents and i could move in and i could care for them. And i was okay with it.

But with time it became more and more difficult to work with my dad (while my dad took over our family business).

A few examples:

* he started belittling me infront of customers and employees, always yelling
* he made fun of my opinions
* he never took my ideas serious that i fought month for for him to even listening to me
* he rushed me while driving, walking, speaking (which caused me to stutter again)
* healways threatened to fire me after I quit my job to work more in the family business
* he didnt paid me the minimum wage of my country, some month i only got 3$/hour (minimum is 12)
* i worked all day long, did work from home in the evenings and on the weekends, but it was never enough and he always called me lazy

While it became more and more difficult his plan for the house became more specific, his ultimate plan was: I would move in, care for my grandparents, pay him the same rent I pay rn, and then he wanted me to wrongly receive unemployment benefits so I could work for him for free.

But after years of working with him i had no strength to fight with him about this and i always just said yes.

1,5 years ago i collapsed after i asked him one time if he could drive me to the hospital to get surgery for a chronical illness i have and he said no.

After this I had depression and panic attacks and i couldn't bring myself to work there again not even for my grandparents (which are the reason i endured it so long). I started therapy and with the help of them I quit my job.

I didnt even thought about the house anymore because so much had happened and for me it was clear I couldnt move in there. But a few weeks after I quit, I helped my grandma with unloading her grocery's from the car, when my dad suddenly parked behind us and said he had bought the house and that we can move in in 6 month. After this I spirelled even deeper in depression, because everything I worked for in therapy seemed wasted.

Thankfully I got a spot in the place I got therapy the first time again and I was able to invite my dad and grandma to a conversation where I wanted to tell them that I wont moving in.

My dad first said yes but than declined because of a football match. So I send him a text telling him I wont move in. Since then I never heard from him again and I cant stop feeling guilty and wrong. 

I feel like im the AH because i promised to move in and because i needed 3 month to find the courage to tell him that, so it wasnt much time left for him to find someone else.

I am a student, I am 20 years old. My family and I are not exactly poor, but we are not the same as the middle class. I won a grant and study for free, at the expense of the state, at one of the highest universities in our country. In order not to strain my parents, I work in addition to good studies. The money I earned is only enough to feed myself. About half a year ago, my friends and I planned to have a vacation abroad, and for this I worked and saved during these 6 months.
We are planning a vacation at the end of the month, and now I have visited my parents and told them that I am planning a vacation. And then they tell me to give this money to them. Note: We live in a small house and they have started building a new house. The construction of the House has not finished yet, but there is no money to finish it. And so, they started scolding me, saying that I am not grateful and I should know my place, that we are poor and we should not go on vacation and give money to them to build a house. 
I do not have such a large amount that will be enough for completion of the house, most likely with my money we will be able to buy some doors.

87,1ekqw3p,"AITA for suggesting psychological help for my gf's ""health anxiety""?","I (21F) am dating Juliet (22F). Recently some things have happened that has caused me to think that Juliet has health anxiety. I'm not a therapist, but I'm 90% she has it. For example, a couple of weeks ago she had a runny nose but only from one side. She told me that she thinks it might be a sign of a cerebrospinal fluid leak. There have been other things, like consistently looking up symptoms online, being hyperaware of her body, picking up one thing that the doctor said and doubting him because of it. Her current worry is about a jutting rib.

Yesterday her anxiety was so bad that she couldn't focus. We were talking and so far I think I had been empathic-ish. Then I mentioned that it was unfortunate her therapist is on break and she can't talk to her. In response, she told me that she hasn't talked to her therapist about this (problem has been going on for months) and she doesn't think it would have eased her concerns. I then told her that this seems like it's not only a physical problem, but a psychological one (bc of the anxiety) and I think both have to be tackled.

My gf proceeded to tell me that she feels like she is being judged for handling it in a certain way and that she can't tackle the psychological without tackling the physical. Afterwards, she told me that she can't ignore the feeling that she's alone in this and it's very scary, and that she can't imagine being married to someone who can't be there for her in a moment like this. She also said that she feels like this isn't important to her and that I don't care as much about her sometimes, also because I haven't been talking with her a lot recently. I have COVID and my thesis needs to be submitted in a month.

EDIT: At this point I told her that maybe it's best she doesn't talk to me about health anxiety because I can't seem to be empathic. (Had discussed doing this with my therapist)

She said that calling it health anxiety is dismissive. She also said that she doesn't emotionally believe that I'd be there for her in case she does end up in a bad situation, like if she were in hospital, because I'm not there her for now. I feel really hurt by this. Recently, when her mum was in hospital I asked her if she wanted me to come. She said no. If I offered to go to hospital when her mum was there, isn't it obvious that I'd be there if Juliet was in hospital?

I can't be honest about my concerns because my suggestion to tackle the issue psychologically came out of concern for her.

89,1ekqrvj,WIBTA for having a backup birthday cake? ,"Hello! So my birthday is on Wednesday. I like to have my party exactly on my birthday if not within a day of it. For the past several years, I've been in charge of managing my birthday cake. I usually order from DQ and have them make a custom cake for me. This year, my friend asked me what kind of cake I want. I told them and mentioned that I usually take care of the birthday cake myself, but they said that I shouldn't have to take on the responsibility of a cake since it's my birthday. I accepted, and I am looking forward to the cake they bring.

However, there's a few things. 

My friend and their partner live almost two hours away, and they let me know that they would already be running late to the party because of some things they have to do. I am anxious about them running super late, since it's a weeknight and I'm having my party end at an earlier hour because people have work the next morning. I also know they've been having some personal issues going on, and I'm worried about them overworking themselves and getting exhausted. I really appreciate their gesture of coming in from out of town and coming to see me for my birthday, but I'm anxious that they're going to burn themselves out. 

Also, since I'm used to being in charge of my own cake, this does throw off my routine a little bit. I am appreciative of someone else taking care of it for me, but with everything going on, I am anxious that they're not going to be able to make it with the cake. I have been considering having a backup cake just in case, and I already talked to my stepmother about the situation--she said that I would be the asshole and she'd be pissed if she made a cake for someone and came in from out of town just for them to have a backup cake. 

I need a reality check. Again, I'm just anxious about how things will pan out (I already have a lot of anxiety about how my birthday will go every year).

I am anxious about them running super late, since it's a weeknight and I'm having my party end at an earlier hour because people have work the next morning. I also know they've been having some personal issues going on, and I'm worried about them overworking themselves and getting exhausted. I really appreciate their gesture of coming in from out of town and coming to see me for my birthday, but I'm anxious that they're going to burn themselves out. 

Also, since I'm used to being in charge of my own cake, this does throw off my routine a little bit. I am appreciative of someone else taking care of it for me, but with everything going on, I am anxious that they're not going to be able to make it with the cake. I have been considering having a backup cake just in case, and I already talked to my stepmother about the situation--she said that I would be the asshole and she'd be pissed if she made a cake for someone and came in from out of town just for them to have a backup cake. 

I need a reality check. Again, I'm just anxious about how things will pan out (I already have a lot of anxiety about how my birthday will go every year). So, would I be the asshole if I got a backup cake, in the event my friends cannot make it it in? I appreciate your feedback!",4.0,0.07963816821575165,0,0
90,1ekq6gt,AITA for refusing to cook for my dad and brother? ,"So, I am a female over 18 and live with my dad and brother is also over 18. Recently I deleted Uber eats. I was spending WAY too much money for the convenience of it. 

After I deleted the app I began cooking at the house like I used to. Making eggs, oatmeal, sandwiches, Mac and cheese ect. 

After cooking I'd clean up after myself. Whatever dishes I'd used I'd wash/dry and put away.

My dad and brother have a habit of asking me to cook (whatever I'm making) for them whenever I start cooking whether it be breakfast, lunch or dinner. 

The problem starts because I'm the ONLY one activity working. My brother quit his job because he was overwhelmed. My dad tore a muscle in his shoulder at work and had surgery to fix it. 

My dad is better and isn't in a sling anymore. He started therapy. My brother is lazy and doesn't want to work. 

Everytime they ask me to cook for them and If I decide to do it, I end up cleaning up by myself anyway. Neither of them offer to do it or help. 

My dad recently has been having me clean the house, sweeping, mopping and vacuuming, taking the garbage out and pulling the cans to the curb. He's also had me start cutting the grass and pulling weeds and such outside. On top of my full time job. 

Since my brother refuses to do anything other than get high and play video games in his room. 

In short I'm overwhelmed, I'm doing pretty much everything around the house, cooking, cleaning and taking care of the yard. By myself. 

My dad just sits in his recliner and watches TV. 

Now I understand taking care of everything when his arm was majority screwed up. But my brother can help and just refuses to. 

As of lately I've started refusing to cook for them. They started calling me a bitch and a brat. “since you're cooking anyway”. 

However, I do know that it's still cheaper for me to live with my dad. If I move out and buy a house or move into an apartment I'll be doing everything anyway. 

I've been overwhelmed for a while, when I ask them to help out I get told to do it myself or figure it out. 

Am I an Asshole for not cooking for them? Am I actually being a bitch? 


Edit: DEAR GOD THIS BLEW UP. OK, so I'll answer some repeated questions, and I'll TRY to read everyones comments and reply where I can. 

My parents are divorced. Mom and step dad live in another state. (Mom and I have a bad relationship she's also abusive.) 

I pay for the groceries, dad has social anxiety and hates going to the store by himself. Brother just doesn't shop, he still uses Uber eats. 

I'm currently looking at apartments, and I'm not going to let my dad and brother know for my own safety. 

I've tried negotiating splitting up the chores and cooking, they do change for a few days. Then it goes back to me doing everything. 

I agree completely that it's misogynistic and that the situation isn't great. I didn't realize how abusive it was getting until everyone started saying that it was.

92,1ekpw0q,AITA - I (24M) got mad at one of my best friends (24F) while she was in a time of need,"Okay so the title makes me the A, but here is the context. Sorry for long post.

My friend and I have been friends for roughly 10 years now. I know her well and she knows me well, or so i would like to believe.

She has had a history of emotional and psychological abuse by her family all throughout her life, and i have been one of a few people who have managed to helped her deal with it and create a trusting relationship with. Her words not mine.

I, on the other hand, have a relatively healthy relationship with my family. It is not perfect, but no family is. We always accepted her with open arms over the years.

So here's what happened.

Last wednesday, she sent me a text saying that her dad kicked her out of the car again (They were coming back from work together). Naturally, i wanted to know more. As i was writing that message, she sent me another text telling me that she did not need me to say that i could not help her, in BOLD. We never write anything in bold, that has never been how we dealt with each other. i knew she was furious, and i have tried to deal with this in the past to no avail. I replied with ""👍 okay take some time to cool down"". I know.
She got mad that i sent a 👍 and told me that she knew she would be a bother to me. She isn't a bother to me and never was. At that point, i got emotional (and irrational) because i felt hurt that she would say that after all the times we helped each other. 
So i replied with ""I'm sorry you feel so frustrated, but i am not the one who will absorb that, go and center yourself and then come talk to me. I do not need to receive that"". To which she left me on seen and proceeded to let our mutual friends know she would not be coming to our gathering that weekend.

A couple hours go by, and i decide to call her. No response. I then texted her to ask how she had been and to let her know i was sorry for earlier and that i hope we can talk about it.

We sent each other long paragraphs of excuses for our behavior. A lot was said but the problem with texts is that we miss a lot of the nuance of in-person communication. But she let me know the trust was broken.

 She did end up coming to the gathering. But she kept making small passive aggressive comments the whole weekend, to which i did not reply. I know where this leads and i know not to partake in that. I told her we needed to have a talk, but that i needed to gather my thoughts beforehand.

Now, let me nuance this by saying that she lives an incredibly stressful life. She has a really high demand job for her age in a particularly stressful field. She used her family trauma to propel her to the top and she is a model for many people around her, including me.

Let me also say that i understand that i am biased in many ways, i have done my best to remedy that, but I know my odds are tilted in my favor because i am the one writing this.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-05,"AITA - I (24M) got mad at one of my best friends (24F) while she was in a time of need Okay so the title makes me the A, but here is the context.

93,1ekpgfn,AITA for inadvertently making fun of a roommate while possibly cleaning up his mess?,"I (21M) lived in an apartment with three other guys (all 21M). They will be referred to as R1-R3.

We all signed a yearly lease, with me renewing for another year. The other three had to move out by the Aug 2.
For Fall and Spring, we all got along great. I found out my summer classes were all online, so I decided to move back home for the Summer to avoid paying rent.

Fast forward to Aug 1, and I arrive at the apt at like 6am. I figure since it's almost time for them to leave, the apartment will be practically spotless.

Well, I open the door, and the place is an absolute mess. And I'm not referring to them having boxes and whatever scattered about, I mean the common area is a DISASTER.

I was genuinely questioning who the hell even lived in here anymore. I just sighed, unpacked, and got to work cleaning.

After about two hours, I go out to get some fresh air. When I get back, R1 is in the kitchen, looking absolutely disgusted before turning to me. He welcomed me back, saying how good it was to see me again. I just agreed before we went to cleaning.

As we were, R1 started complaining about how bad it's gotten since I left. Apparently, after I moved out, R3 became an absolute slob around the apartment. Sure, HIS room remained clean, but he just gave up on cleaning anywhere around the common area.

I didn't 100% believe him because

1) R1 and R2 weren’t exactly clean themselves with regards to the common area.

2) All of R3's pots and pans were gone by the time I'd arrived.

Although, R3 would take food out to cook, forget, and just leave it to go bad, or his leftovers would go bad in the fridge until someone threw it out.

Anyways, I somewhat play devil's advocate, telling R1 about 2 of my former roommies who were MUCH worse slobs than R3. We continue to joke for a bit, and I go up to my room for 2 min. As I do, I hear the front door open and close, so I figure R1 must've gone outside. But when I go downstairs, I see R1 coming out of his room.

I ask if he went outside. He said no. R2 was at work, and R3 supposedly moved out already. So I figure it must've been one of the neighbors leaving their apt.

After hours of cleaning, I sent a text in the gc telling R3 good luck wherever he ends up next before passing out.
The next morning at about 7am, my phone vibrates in my pocket. R1 looks at his phone before telling me to look in the gc. Confused, I pull out my phone to see that R3 said R1 and I were serious jackasses.

94,1ekp69n,AITA for telling my boyfriend I dislike his father?,"I (25f) live with my boyfriend (26m) for several weeks now- ever since I got thrown out of my previous rented apartament because of my landlord’s greediness. My boyfriend immediately invited me to live with him, as I cannot return to my parents’ home yet (because of my job here- they live several hours away) and I welcomed that proposition with joy- I wanted to live with him for a long time.
My boyfriend lives in his family house on the outskirts of our city with his widowed dad. He never moved out because he never had to- he went to the high school and uni here, now works in the city. He is quite content and never wanted to move out, even when I offered to rent a flat together last year- he said he wanted to save money, so I went to live with a roommate instead. 

Now I live with my boyfriend, his dad and his dog, and I am so tired… my boyfriend’s dad is a grumpy, old man who is extremely attention seeking at the same time. He constantly tries to provoke me (for example, by calling the female Olympics Team „stupid c**ts” and looking for my reaction to the slur; by eating the food I buy and complaining it’s bland and tasteless, but most importantly- by negging my boyfriend constantly). My boyfriend is a hardworking young man, who spends an awful lot of time at work (2 jobs) as a doctor- same as me. Despite that, his father often calls him an idiot, along with worse names. He likes to shame him in front of me; telling jokes about his „poor appearance” or the way he does everything wrong. He constantly leaves a mess in a kitchen, then watches me clean that up, saying nothing or making jokes about what a poor job I do loading the dishwasher.
He listens to our private conversations, even behind closed doors. He walks around the house wearing nothing but his underwear, which is his God given right, as he is the owner of this house, but still makes me uncomfortable.
Whenever I offer to my boyfriend that we could move out for a few months before another important chapter of our careers start, he tells me he doesn’t want to leave his widowed dad alone.
But the way they talk- barking at each other- and the way his father often calls him, treats him like sht and orders him around like a boy makes me sad- and I feel terrible for it, as this is the house of both my boyfriend and his dad and I’m living here thanks to their good will. However, I am pretty sure both of them are quite happy with the situation- my boyfriend doesn’t have to move out and can live with me and his father has another person to order around like a slave- and neither wants to change the situation. I am supposed to move out in November, but I can no longer imagine another week with this man under the same roof.
So I ended up expressing my thoughts aloud. Now my boyfriend is hurt, as he feels I am harsh for the lonely old man who cannot express his emotions properly. AITA?

My (21F) and my Fiancé (24M) were asked a few months ago by my Mother (47F) to dog sit for her while she went on a holiday with my siblings, a Sister (18F) and Brother (9M). My childhood was never great, my father (43M) was physically and emotionally abusive towards me for as long as I can remember, presumably my sister too though she can't remember much of her childhood, and incredibly emotionally abusive and angry towards my brother, the youngest. My mother only divorced him around Spring of 2022 after a specific incident, and he has been kicked out once before when I broke down to a school counsellor, though he soon came back. She always knew he was abusive and was aware of his mistreatment of my siblings but never did anything. I love my mother, but she is a neglectful and dysfunctional person who is financially irresponsible, which will be elaborated on.

When I was growing up, and as long as I lived here (was kicked out Winter of 2022) the house was a mess, cluttered with many condition issues and infestations, but upon returning to dog-sit for her it has come to my attention it has become significantly worse. The damp and black mould infestations have gotten severe to the point of the ceiling peeling off in places, no appliance works properly (washing machine is flooded, which my mother never noticed, and bellows out smoke when you try to use it, the shower head is blocked, etc). My little brother still sleeps in a bed at the back of my mothers bedroom, and you have to walk over so many things (you can't see the floor) just to get to her bed, and then he walks over her bed to climb into his own. It's essentially falling apart, with even the back garden being overgrown to the point it's impossible to safely use or enter. Outside of the general clutter and obvious health hazards, there are health and safety and electrical concerns everywhere. Directly contradicting the advice on the sticker, the small cupboard with the boiler (which we've turned off as it was buzzing to the point of making the upstairs floor vibrate) and pipes are blocked off with a clothing rack inside it where all the clothes go to dry, with flammable fabrics in immediate proximity, if not touching, much of it. The stairs also have clutter with a banister missing, and the fire alarm upstairs is gone, and all the vents have been covered by wallpaper or duck tape. There's much more wrong, but I won't elaborate for the sake of being concise. It's worse than whatever you're thinking. Even the stovetop in the kitchen is covered with things, and there's a cage with a guinea pig living in it in the corner of the kitchen.

The holiday they're on is a 3 week trip in America, it was largely funded by my sisters Personal Independence Payment money. She has autism and severe social anxiety, and never spends money as she doesn't leave the house. She's terrified of the outdoors, bugs and people. My mum has historically churned credit cards and used them to pay for holidays and designer items, but she no longer is allowed credit cards nor can she receive new ones. The house is rented from the council, and we have always been poor. My little brother has more severe autism, at his age still struggling in education, struggling to read and write. My siblings are completely codependent on my mother and she never taught us any skills and won't get my sister any therapy to help her, and my sister is attached to the dog (A 3 year old Black American Labrador) to the point where she believes she has nothing in life but him, and has said before without him she has nothing to live for and would kill herself. It's worse than whatever you're thinking, these issues are deeply ingrained.

Since arriving there I have grappled with what I believe to be a moral duty to report this to the council or England's equivalent of CPS, I have consulted with friends who agreed, but my Fiancé is more hesitant on the matter, worrying about the consequences of my sister most probably harming herself if she's separated from the dog and how my brother would cope being separated from family given his issues and the codependence of the whole family. For some more transparency, we were paid £300 to dog sit for the three weeks, with an additional £100 being paid afterwards. The whereabouts of my father are unknown, he was last heard from on the 3rd of June this year after an apparent bike accident landed him in physiotherapy, though he is hundreds in debt (we are receiving letters from debt collectors regarding him). We have no family members with the capacity to take in my siblings, nor the dog.

96,1ekp1fv,AITA for being a better babysitter for neighbors and aunts and uncles but not my mom and her husband?,"I (17f) started babysitting 3 years ago. It started with a neighbor (dad's neighbor) asking me for a few hours every other Saturday and then night sitting with other neighbors of my dad's. Extended family also got me to babysit. I loved it. And it was a great way for me to earn money because I was so well know and appreciated that I was paid really well for it. My dad encouraged me to save money from babysitting which I did.

My mom got married 2 years ago and her husband has three kids, 8, 7 and 5. I'm not close with my mom. I prefer being with my dad but when I tried to stop going to her house it became a fight in court and the judge said mom would get custody of me if I didn't keep going. So I'm there every other week.

A few months ago my mom told me to babysit since I was doing it for so many others. I didn't want to, I told her this, she informed me I had no choice in the matter, and so I sucked it up. But I wasn't doing the same stuff as when I willingly babysit. I basically just sat in the house with mom's stepkids until she and her husband came home. I didn't play with them or make a nice dinner for them. I put pizza or whatever quick on and left them to their own devices.

Mom knew how much more I did with cousins I was babysitting because some are on her side of the family. She had me babysit several more times for her stepkids and then a couple of weeks ago her and her husband asked me where my good babysitting reputation was gone. They told me I basically ignore the kids and do nothing while I babysit for them. I said yeah. I said they can force me to babysit but they can't force me to be a good one. My mom's husband said his kids feelings were hurt that I wasn't more fun, that they expected more fun from me. I told him I never wanted to babysit his kids. Mom told me I willingly babysit for neighbors and have a great time with their kids. I said again, choice. Mom talked to a couple of her siblings and found how just how much better I am babysitting for my cousins than her stepkids and she showed up at dad's house to complain to me.

She told me I should be ashamed and I said I'm not. And that I won't babysit for her once I'm 18 and she no longer has a say over me or my life at all. Apparently they will still make me babysit until then. Mom said I should grow up and be better. That I should be good to the only siblings I will ever have.

102,1ekmyu0,WIBTA for not driving my sister around while she's here on holiday because she gives me migraines?,"My sister (38F) is visiting on holiday so that she can go to her best friend's hen-weekend and wedding. Her flights are 30 hours each way and cost her around £3,000 in total, but she's staying with our parents, so she doesn't have to pay for a hotel or food. She is spending 19 of the 25 days she's here out with her friends or other family. Though she does not require a lift on every day.

I (28F) also live with our parents and I am not working and so ideally I should be free to drive her anywhere. However, I get debilitating migraines. (Pre-emptively adding that no migraines are clinically not headaches. They are a neurological condition with a range of symptoms, including a headache). They are so bad that I get 2 steroid injections in the back on my head every 3 months to control them. But I still get at least 2 migraines a week. They are also the main reason I'm not working.

My migraines are on hairpin triggers, and I put a lot of work into controlling my mood, my environment, my food and drink, and my activities so that I can avoid getting one / making them worse. It is fair to say they rule my entire life, as everything I do is to avoid migraines.

But my sister stresses. A lot and at the tiniest inconvenience. She snaps at me easily when she's stressed (which is anytime I drive her because she is always late. This is her own fault not mine. She does not give herself enough time to get ready, never has, and wouldn’t if I asked her to).

I understand that she is not trying to be mean: she is nice to me afterwards and always thanks me for driving her. Her stressing is part of her personality, she cannot help it. But I cannot physically stop her stress from affecting me and giving me a migraine while we're in such close space.

It is specifically her, though. I'm happy to drive my friends around places because they are much calmer and don't give me migraines. For example, tomorrow I am picking up one of my friends on the way to the cinema.

I know my sister spent a lot of time and money to get here, and she doesn't ask for a lift very often from me (3 times total in the week she's been here), more often she gets lifts from our parents. But it is making me physically ill to help her.

Would I be the asshole if I just started telling her no. That she had to get her friends to pick her up more, rent a car, or get an Uber?

EDIT: nope I do not work and live with my parents. This is context but remember it is not part of the problem as I'm taking time out for health reasons and my mum is the one who insisted I wasn't ready to return to work.

103,1ekmxjk,AITA For laughing at the name my sister chose for her baby?,"[UPDATE AT END]

For context, I (28F) attended a family dinner with my mom, dad and sister (26F) yesterday. My sister is due to give birth soon and decided this dinner would be the perfect time to announce the name she chose for her first child

My sister has always been obssesed with aesthetics, her whole house is beige and rather depressing if im honest. The whole nursery she built for baby is beige and grey and will not accept colourful gifts for the baby. I can tell her husband hates it but he won't admit it.

Now here is the issue, i am very prone to laughing at inappropriate times. I am autistic and find it hard to filter what I say and my emotions, which can lead to me reacting to things in ways that can offend people. I didn't think this would cause issues, until she revealed the name of her baby

So, we are all done with our dinner, we are looking at my sister as announces her baby will be named..

And then i burst out laughing, and said 'You cannot be serious'

I am now banned from all family dinners

Is the name really that bad? Was I really a massive asshole?

UPDATE:
After writing this post I decided to call my sister and apologise, as when i wrote down what happened i did realise what a dick move that was. I said I was sorry for laughing and I apologised for using my mental disability as an excuse and offered to treat her to lunch as an apology

Understanably she was reluctant to forgive me, but she did which i am thankful for. She said she was hurt by my actions which I understood but was willing to look past it.

He has 2-3 alarms in case he doesn’t wake up and every once in a while I have to turn them off myself if he’s in the kitchen and can’t hear it.

I guess I was taken aback by his unwillingess to do something I deem as simple, so I just wanted other perspectives.

Backstory, a very good friend of ours passed nearly a decade ago. They specified in their end of life arrangements that they wanted me to perform a song for their funeral procession. 

It was an awful time, they were taken too soon, there were many lovely friends and family at the funeral but also some hostile parties (close knit community with a lot of infighting). I performed the song unaccompanied as was her wish. My partner had to work that day (which made them feel terrible but it couldn’t be helped) but at the wake I told them what the song was and how I couldn’t bear hearing it again if it could be helped. 

It’s an old one, though popular, if I hear it on the radio I switch stations. If it gets performed anywhere else I leave the room. It just hurts too much (yes I have sought counselling and been told this is not an unreasonable reaction and simply removing myself or the sound is acceptable). The problem is when I do this (switch it off, change channel, leave) my partner takes offence and gets upset/angry. I have to explain it over and over that it breaks me to hear this song. This was their friend too. They understand my grief. So why do they keep singing it and acting like they forgot? I have to say why every single time.

108,1ekk1ib,AITA for telling my sister she's being OTT about her stepson preferring his original last name to his current one?,"My sister Angela (41f) has a stepson Josh (15m). Angela and Josh's dad Brian (44m) have been married for the last 4 years and together for the last 7. Brian and Josh's mom were a ONS that resulted in a baby Josh. Both were present as parents for Josh. One thing that was always a big deal for Brian and for Angela when she met Brian, was the fact Josh had his mom's last name and not his dad's. This was a decision Josh's mom made and Brian disliked it and felt it should have been his name. Not a hyphenated name but just his. He did not feel like Josh's mom needed Josh to have her last name. Angela also feels that way. She's a big believer in kids having dad's last name and doesn't believe mom needs to pass down hers. But she's also big on no kids before marriage and women taking the man's last name in marriage.

Josh's mom died 5 years ago. Brian, and Angela in support of Brian, changed Josh's last name about a year after to his last name. Which was around the time Angela and Brian got married. This made Angela *very* happy because she wanted to share the same last name as both of them. She said it was the family name instead of being just the marriage name because Josh wasn't a ""their last name"". I always found it strange that she was so invested in her stepson's last name. She gives the vibe that she wants to be mistaken for Josh's mom and it does happen more now.

The point of this post though is that while Josh has never expressed any issue with his last name being changed as such, he prefers going by the original last name/his mom's last name. He still uses that in his own interactions with people. Brian and Angela are aware of this. Brian was surprised Josh hadn't fully embraced the new last name. Josh told him that he hadn't wanted to change it but he didn't think it was worth fighting over. Angela tried to express why them all having the same last name was better and Josh told her that it didn't make them more of a family and it didn't make him her son just because they have the same last name. He said nobody who actually knows him will ever think she's his mom. He also said he liked having the same name as his mom. He told them he'll change it back when he's 18 and it doesn't need to be a big deal.

Angela has been so obsessed with the last name stuff and Josh's wish to go back to the old last name. She talks about it frequently. She told me how much it upsets and bothers her, how she has all these plans and hopes that the plans will work to convince Josh to keep and embrace his last name now. I told her she's so OTT about it, that Josh isn't her kid and his name should not be this big of a deal to her. She told me I was wrong on all counts and I should understand that Josh needs her more than he'll ever understand and that the name problem is bigger than just them because so many kids are getting mom's name vs dad's.

The question wasn’t really offensive more so curious, so me and S were trying to explain to him how specifically a cooking knife can feel dramatically different when you use it regularly.

But then G and S looked at each other and said “that just a mean to say to someone”, then laughed and called me a A-H (in a jokingly way) 

I didn’t get it at all why that would be a bad thing to say cause to me it’s not an insult at all, but both G and S insisted that saying “you have few interests” is bad cause it’s like saying “you are not an interesting person”.

We have argued for like an hour on why saying “you have few interests” to someone is an insult or not. I don’t understand why it’s negative but they (G and S) insists on saying that statement to someone even if it is true will be interpreted as that person being boring.

111,1ekjez6,AITA for not getting a wedding gift? ,"UPDATE: thank you for all the responses, I am reading them on, truly going through all of them. This is my plan, is hold my ground, see if she reaches out about this wedding gift. If she does, I’ll push back with a lot of the responses yall posted saying that she made no effort to allow me there, and why would I get a gift to a wedding I’m not invited to and so on. I’m curious myself, hence why I’m gonna wait this out to see. 

Quick background, it’s one my my closest friends getting married. 

I am happy for her, but I also feel hurt that I’m not allowed to come to the wedding reception. I will be in a different country and will be flying back the day of and possibly miss the ceremony, but be there for the reception. She said that her wedding planner says I can’t show up since there is a possibility that I’ll miss the ceremony. 

Update/Added info onto why I’ll be showing up the day of: I am on a cruise in Europe, and her wedding is on the last day of the cruise. By the time I get to the airport I will miss the first flight back, so I would have to take the later one, and the 2hr drive (1hr 45min usually want it takes) to get to where the ceremony and reception is, will make me a couple hours late

She is one person I supported financially in the past, and she expects a great gift from me as she knows I have money, but I feel like she shut the door on me not making an exception or fighting to have me there. I will flying back from the opposite corner of the earth and driving 2hrs to where it’s being held and she just brushed off the journey it will take me to get there for her. Her response was, “you’re gonna miss out” 

So I feel like I shouldn’t have to get her a gift of any sorts since it seems she doesn’t even want me there. 

The other reason I feel like that, is she never let me meet any of her family, friends or anyone. I am male, and we used to hang out all the time (never dated or anything, as I had feelings for her but she didn’t). I don’t even think she ever mentioned me to anyone, and we are close friends for over three years. The other male in our friend group got to meet all her friends and family, and always got mentioned to other, but with me it was different. I think she is embarrassed of me which is why she isn’t trying to get me to go, or allowing me to go. I also currently live in a different city, so now we’re online friends, when she started dating her fiancé, which I met briefly once for 10minutes in an airport. Every time I go back home, and ask to go to dinner or something with them, she makes lame excuses also. Which adds on to all this. 

So AITA for not wanting to give her a gift?

I will be in a different country and will be flying back the day of and possibly miss the ceremony, but be there for the reception. She said that her wedding planner says I can’t show up since there is a possibility that I’ll miss the ceremony. 

Update/Added info onto why I’ll be showing up the day of: I am on a cruise in Europe, and her wedding is on the last day of the cruise. By the time I get to the airport I will miss the first flight back, so I would have to take the later one, and the 2hr drive (1hr 45min usually want it takes) to get to where the ceremony and reception is, will make me a couple hours late

She is one person I supported financially in the past, and she expects a great gift from me as she knows I have money, but I feel like she shut the door on me not making an exception or fighting to have me there. I will flying back from the opposite corner of the earth and driving 2hrs to where it’s being held and she just brushed off the journey it will take me to get there for her. Her response was, “you’re gonna miss out” 

So I feel like I shouldn’t have to get her a gift of any sorts since it seems she doesn’t even want me there. 

The other reason I feel like that, is she never let me meet any of her family, friends or anyone. I am male, and we used to hang out all the time (never dated or anything, as I had feelings for her but she didn’t). I don’t even think she ever mentioned me to anyone, and we are close friends for over three years. The other male in our friend group got to meet all her friends and family, and always got mentioned to other, but with me it was different. I think she is embarrassed of me which is why she isn’t trying to get me to go, or allowing me to go. I also currently live in a different city, so now we’re online friends, when she started dating her fiancé, which I met briefly once for 10minutes in an airport. Every time I go back home, and ask to go to dinner or something with them, she makes lame excuses also. Which adds on to all this. 

So AITA for not wanting to give her a gift?

112,1ekjag0,AITA for ruining finances for my gf and myself.  ,"Hello everyone, I (26M) am an international student and made a pretty big mistake by getting a credit card during university, despite having a minimal allowance and no job.
I ended up using it irresponsibly and now I'm saddled with over $4,000 in debt. I'm currently employed, but my income barely covers essentials like food and bills, so paying off the credit card has been slow.
My girlfriend (26F) of 7 years also has credit card debt, but she has been much more responsible about paying it off, even though she had a very low-paying job recently.

During this time for about 6 months or so, I supported her with food, entertainment, fuel, and other necessities whilst also paying off minimum on my card.

The last few months have been tough, and one of her car insurance payments, which is set up as a direct debit from my account, got returned because I didn't have enough funds. I genuinely didn't realize this had happened as I must have missed the notification. Unfortunately, this has likely affected her credit score, which was never my intention. She also spoke with her mom about this and I feel like she, like any parent, is quite disappointed with me. 

Now, my girlfriend feels that our financial issues are too much to handle, and she doesn't want to continue the relationship especially with someone financially unstable and irresponsible. I completely understand her perspective as everyone wants a partner who is financially responsible and stable, and I failed in that regard. 

I've apologized, but it seems she's made up her mind. She has pretty much called me a horrible person for not having my shit together at this age and wants to go separate ways. 

I'm torn about what to do next. AITA in this whole situation?

113,1ekj9zp,AITA for cancelling a holiday for myself and my best friend and losing £2000?,"Hi all, I’ve spoken with a few friends about this (including the best friend) and some are calling me TA but some are saying I’m in the right. The history:

I (29F) and my best friend (29F) booked a holiday to Rio for later on this month. I booked and paid for it entirely out of my own money after a very lucky lottery win of about £10k. We’ve both wanted to go for years, and after the win, I told her I’d treat us and take us on holiday. She paid nothing toward, just the renewal of her passport, I paid for it completely. 

We were set to go in 2 weeks, but this weekend I saw red and cancelled the entire thing as it’s too late to change the passenger and too late to change the dates. The only outcome was for me to go, or cancel and lose money. 

Why did I cancel? This weekend my friend and I were discussing our plans for our trip and she mentioned “Oh, well John* is due to land the day after us so we can ask what he thinks to our plans?”

John (27?M) is her most recent boyfriend. John is not a nice person and I do not get on with him at all. I had no idea he had booked to go when we were there, and after asking he booked as a solo traveller AFTER I booked ours, so essentially coming on holiday with us. A little background on John is he is unemployed (legally, he’s a self proclaimed “pharmacist” if you catch my drift). I don’t trust him, he essentially love bombed my friend, he never has a nice word to say about me when we all get together. 

After I cancelled, both my friend and John called me TA (among many other names) and I’ve not spoken to either since.

114,1ekj6ey,AITA for not helping my dad because I think a  therapist should help him?,"My mother recently passed away and my dad always used her as emotional support I think. We all did and I guess she just filled the role (well maybe normal to do it for your children).

My brother is a bit estranged from the family but whenever he needs money is happy to act like we are all best friends. He recently blocked me because I called him out on taking too much money from my dad.

My dad has struggled with his mental health for a long time but since my mom never wanted to see a therapist he didn't agree to it either.

Being around my dad is hard for me. In childhood it was okay but I knew he was depressed. During my teen years it was harder. When I needed emotional support, at least 50-70% of the time he would brush it off or tell me I don't have problems or to leave him alone.

Now he wants me around to take care of him emotionally. I live in another country and I already felt guilty not to take care of my mom (I would have, if my dad had allowed me to do things my way but it was always just his way or ""why are you even here then?""). So I mostly stay away. 

While I am not holding a grudge about what he did to me when I was a teen, I became independent and took care of me. But I feel part of him just wants to control me even if he really is mentally sick. I told him I would only consider living with him if he goes to therapy.

On top of all of that, he does take medications but I feel he sometimes forgets or meds alone don't help. He and my family make me feel bad for not wanting to talk to him but it destroys my mental health. Living with him literally makes me get sick because I have to take care of his mental state but mine meanwhile declines (he pretends to care about me or thinks he does but he doesn't have the tools to show empathy).

Am I the asshole for refusing to talk to him much until he gets therapy? 

Each time I call (rarely) I greet him and ask him how he is doing (bad of course, so I feel guilty), then ask him why he didn't get therapy yet. There is no issues about this, he knows he can make an appointment and everyone else in the family agrees he should make an appointment. But I still feel like an asshole for being curt with him. I'm just so tired; even if he is sick, I don't want to take care of him if it means giving my own health and youth (well I'm 34 but feel like I'm just drained and rapidly aging around him).",Not the A-hole,2024-08-05,"AITA for not helping my dad because I think a  therapist should help him?

115,1ekiu3z,AITA for resenting my mom so much?,"Backstory: I met my stepdad as a baby and he has been in my life for as long as I can remember. We’ve never really been close/formed a relationship, he’s not really a nice guy and he actually beat my mother when she was pregnant with their first kid when I was about 6 years old.

He’s extremely possessive, paranoid, controlling, stubborn, and unable to handle his emotions. He will get upset over the smallest things and do everything he can to make everyone else’s life as miserable as he is. An example: he loses track of his money sometimes and swears my mother or I stole it. He then takes away everything (ex wifi) and tells my siblings (8,10, & 17yrs) it’s MY fault, only to then find the money somewhere HE left it in but just forgot. Then he just lets us have everything he took away and doesn’t apologize or anything and acts like everything is normal. 

Moving on to the current situation: I graduated undergrad recently and am currently in grad school. Ever since graduating I have lived with my mom given my job is 5 minutes away from the house. I LOVE this job and it’s the best thing that has happened to me financially. Since I don’t own a car and really need this job, I have to live with my mom for the time being since my dad lives about 40 minutes away from my job. There are currently 7 people in the house: my mom, stepdad, three siblings, my stepdads dad, and myself. My stepdad hates that I live at home and since day 1 has said it’s too crowded and that I have to leave. My mom argues back that it’s not fair his dad gets to live at home but I (her child) can’t. 

Anyways, we work together and have a shift together for the first time in a minute. He’s working a private event and I’m at the bar. His “assistant” comes and asks me for something for my stepdad 4 times. And I get it for him every time no complaints. But he asked for a huge drink (15+ shots) when I was super busy and so I tell his assistant I can’t at the moment. About 5 minutes later my step dad comes and asked me why I didn’t make the drink with a bad attitude. I gestured to the bar and told him I was busy, he then proceeds to say “making drinks is my literal job” which I reply by saying “it’s yours too, why didn’t you make it”. He then tells me in Spanish (in front of Spanish speaking patrons) that I am a lazy b-word. I’m of course caught off guard and once I get the sympathetic looks I go to the back and cry my heart out.

He is now saying that I drew a line by bringing our home issues to the job we share and that I have 15 days to gtfo. He’s kicked me out before so now that I know he will kick me out, I am scared he will succeed in kicking me out again. And so AITA for resenting my mom for letting things go on for so long.

She’s shared behaviors that make me uncomfortable. For instance, she tracks her boyfriend’s location, monitors his social media, and interrogates him about any changes. She also body-shames him, calling him “too fat,” and even tries to show me pictures to prove her point. This behavior is exhausting, especially since she’s tried to use my phone to check his followers, calling me “kinda useless” if I refuse.

Additionally:

1) She frequently puts me down, asking things like, “Why on earth would you do ____? Don’t you know better?” She says this in front of family, embarrassing me.

2) When we travel together, she gaslights me until I cry, then tells others she doesn’t know why I’m upset.

3) She often comments on my appearance, saying I “looked better in my skinny era,” referring to when I was 16 and barely eating.

About a week ago, she messaged me out of the blue, suggesting we go to the gym together. Though surprised, I agreed to once-a-week sessions. She soon revealed she and her boyfriend had broken up because she was “sick of how fat he was and that he lies too much.” Shocked by her harshness, I kept it short and apologized for her tough time.

118,1ekiib6,AITA for not paying rent to my ex for the last month of our lease? (She kicked me out),"Gf (25F) and I (24M) ended our relationship of 4 years in July and she's asked me to move out. I found a new place I've moved into in August ($1,450 rent + $1,450 damage deposit). She's asking me to pay my share of the lease in the old place ($1,650 total, half is my share) for the month of August that I won't be living there. I don't think it is fair that I will have incurred $3,725 in August while she only pays $825. Her reasoning is ""You have a good job you can afford it"" however it is still a lot of money for me too. The lease is technically under her name so I don't think I have a legal obligation to pay either, but I'd like to end things on good terms.

119,1ekii19,AITA I don’t appreciate my boyfriend’s brother ,"My boyfriend (M) 31, and I (F) 27 have been together for 10 months now. We get along well and have talks about starting a family together.
We both are very family oriented, it is one of the reasons why we started dating in the first place. However he has an older brother who seems to be tormenting our relationship. He has a history of lying, cheating and stealing from his own family! He would steal their belongings to sell for money or just steal their money then lie about who the perpetrator may be. I have never met this brother yet he has already managed to steal from me, my brother enquired his help selling my phone but it turned out missing hour’s later. Only to find that he was trying to make us believe that the phone was stolen so that he can sell it for a profit.
This happened 3 months after my boyfriend and I started dating and of course, it left a sore taste in my mouth.
Fast forward to June when the brother came to my boyfriend with a business proposal, I had a bad feeling about it and told my boyfriend but for some reason, he trusted his brother. My boyfriend doesn’t have a car, so for important reasons he asks to make use of mine and I lend it to him, on this particular day he needed the car to go have a business meeting with his brother, he had told me 30 minutes before he had to go that he would be using my car and I said no. This turned into an argument about his brother which led to us breaking up. 
Two weeks later he’s at my doorstep wanting to reconcile which we do. I then find out that his brother did in fact steal his cut of the money from the business deal while we were apart, now the problem arises once again when he asked about how I felt about his brother and I was unable to answer him

I (48f) met my now ex best friend (46f) when I was in 8th grade, so it's been a few years, 33! 😬
  In that time we've lost parents and kids, we each got married, I had kids, she did not. In our 20's I had a son and was a single parent. She helped a lot. Made sure my son had food and clothes. She was Aunt Stacey. She went into the Army and i stayed in our home town to raise my son. During this time I had to ask for money to borrow, never more than $100 , and not often. I always paid it back, it may have taken a bit, but I kept her in the loop. Years go on as they do, in that time I found myself in crippling alcohol addiction, long story short, I had to leave and move 2 hrs away to a sober living house. With in a month I relapsed, I was going to lose everything, so in order to stay sober I went back to smoking weed. I'm in a legal state, the sober house still won't allow it. They turned a blind eye a couple times, so I knew it would be sooner than later.  So, that day came and I was asked to leave because I was positive for mj. I was planning on moving and had a room lined up, just needed a couple days. I was supposed to stay through the weekend, but try living with 10 women in recovery....shit was said and, tempers flared. YSo I was ""encouraged "" to leave in 6 hours, in a horrible snow storm, with a dead phone and a panic attack. I'm in Wendy's with no money, no place to sleep, I have to work in the morning, my phone is at 5%. I text my friend (I couldn't call, only push a text out quick) ""Can I please borrow $60 for a room that night. I can pay you back Wendnesday."" Gave brief details about what happened. It ended up my boss called and loaned me the money and I took off and got a room. I heard nothing from her.
The next day, I text her You know we been around the block a few times. I thought I could at least get a response. 
Oh...her response was horribly mean, childish and, totally surprising. I don't know if these details are important...but basically I'm a terrible friend ( I wouldn't say terrible), selfish (I disagree), and a bad friend because I text and don't call (telling me I'm wrong about my choice of conversation by demanding i cotact her, her way)...etc. just stupid childish things. 
I explained, my situation, being at Wendy's, dead phone, panic attack, snow storm. She was like ""Oh, well I didn't know that"" 
I said, well I couldn't explain it all then, I just figured my BFF, ride or die, sister, had my back. That was in January, I don't want to throw this friendship away, I'm still too angry to write a letter (she blocked me on EVERYTHING, even email 😳)

127,1ekgf0d,AITA for refusing to take care of my grandma who raised me when I was 2-3?,"I (15F) have been living myself, a few months after I turned 15, this is not recent but people have been guilt-tripping me (or so I would like to believe) about something I did/didn't do back when I was 14/15.

Context:

I was raised by my grandma when I was 2-3 years old (she was very loving to me during that time), after she started having different mental illnesses and required therapy and certain injections because she would freak out and keep on shouting in the middle of the night, my childhood was pretty f-cked up because of that because my grandma would hurl abuses at my mother.

When I was 14:  
I used to live with my little sister(8F then), my father(41 M then), my mother (40 F then), my grandma (65+ F) and my grandpa (70+ M). I was kind of home-schooled ever since I was 12 so I used to stay at home and attend online classes. I was 14 when my grandma had a paralysis attack on my exam day, it was also my little sister's 8th birthday.

I (15F) have been living myself, a few months after I turned 15, this is not recent but people have been guilt-tripping me (or so I would like to believe) about something I did/didn't do back when I was 14/15.

Context:

I was raised by my grandma when I was 2-3 years old (she was very loving to me during that time), after she started having different mental illnesses and required therapy and certain injections because she would freak out and keep on shouting in the middle of the night, my childhood was pretty f-cked up because of that because my grandma would hurl abuses at my mother.

When I was 14:  
I used to live with my little sister(8F then), my father(41 M then), my mother (40 F then), my grandma (65+ F) and my grandpa (70+ M). I was kind of home-schooled ever since I was 12 so I used to stay at home and attend online classes. I was 14 when my grandma had a paralysis attack on my exam day, it was also my little sister's 8th birthday.

128,1ekgeff,WIBTA for booting our kids from our wedding?,"Me and my fiance have been together for 7 years now. We got engaged 2 years ago and have since planned a few dates but ultimately pushed the date back again now to 2025. We are a blended family of 9 with one being together.the kids age range from 20 to 3.  Everyone knows wedding are expensive but with a large family it’s even more expensive. I have been married before while my fiance has not. He could care less how we get married but I would love to have a wedding. (My first wedding I was very young (17) my mother planned the whole thing even set the date I had no say in much of it, like it wasn’t my wedding at all). Recently, given that I would be the one souly paying for the wedding( I’m the bread winner in the family) I’ve started considering not having the kids be in the wedding. Since my father has passed away I planned on having my oldest son who will be 18 at the wedding walk me down the aisle and my daughter who will be 11 be our flower girl and our son together along with my niece be the mini bride and groom. We planned on doing a part in our ceremony where we blend the family something like when the bride and groom do the mixture of the sand or lighting a candle, we would involve the kids in ours of “blending our families together” this is the extent of involvement. Originally we had planned on each kid being a bridesmaid or groomsmen but my fiance having 3 daughters (me being the one having to pay for their dresses, shoes hair it’s adding up) I’ve really started considering just not having them as bridemaids. My son would not be a groomsmen after walking me down either. I mean I honestly feel like we both give so much of ourselves daily to our kids that we should have our day be about us. My son is ok with it but I know my finances daughters will be mad if they can’t be bridemaids. The whole thing makes me not want to have a wedding but then that makes me sad bc I want to have that experience with my fiance. 
I would like to add that this is not something I would decide without my fiance as it is his day too. 
Adding the girls and his son into the wedding is an additional $800. (at time of wedding kids will be 20,18,18,17,16,11,4) 
My 3 bridemaids are paying for their own dresses shoes and hair 
His groomsmen are paying for their clothes
The wedding is a small wedding 100 people or less 
Doing a destination wedding and having no one stand with us would cost us the same since we would be paying for a very large rental house or condo some where plus plane tickets there for 9 people. Because I’ve also considered this to avoid conflict but then we wouldn’t have all of our family be able to be there

I was told to put it in the written calendar for rostering. Now, this is a calendar that hangs on the wall and everyone shares, so in the interest of not blocking out the whole thing, I only marked the day I'm leaving as me being ""away"" and coming back as ""returning"", the latter being in the next month so not immediately obvious when looking at the thing.

130,1ekfwxj,AITA for expecting my roommate to pay me back?,"Update 12 hours later: after she left this morning, she confronted me over text about why things have seemed off since our conversation last night. I explained to her how the normal and right thing to do would have been to pay it back or *at least* offer. I told her that people don't just assume it doesn't have to be. That's just not how it works out here in the world. She tried to argue that it's ""not how it works out here in the world. It's subjective to everybody. I grew up taught that if you help someone then you don't pay them back.""

So I told her ""Yes it is, trust me on that. Sure there may be outliers out there, and maybe other cultures who do it differently, but the default is that unless you're told it's good, you don't have to pay it back, then yes you should at least offer to pay it back.""

She was mad in her response, but agreed to pay me back. We've since made up. I still have my concerns about possibly spending another year here with her, but we agreed to *actually* work on having better communication, and for me that's preferable to moving in with my family.

THANK YOU everyone who responded! All of your comments were very helpful, and I will definitely be more cautious from this point forward. 😅😁
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I'll try my best to give as much necessary context here *and* keep it clear instead of a jumbled mess, haha.

So my roommate (F23) and I (M26) have been living together for 11 months. We have been best friends for a little longer than that. We are both not doing well financially due to various reasons, none that we have in common. She borrowed money from her family a 2-3 times recently while she's been looking for a job, each time it was under $500. I have had to borrow $2,000 from my family all at once just about a week ago because my current job is giving me next to nothing as far as hours go (I am also job hunting). In all likelihood, we're both probably going to have a new job being employed by the same company by the end of this week.

The issue is this: she owes me $350 for a car payment she asked for my help with. That was months ago now, but I'm not the type to constantly bring it up or pressure anyone to pay me back. Any time it has been brought up she reassured me she would pay it back when she can, and that's still true as of our conversation earlier tonight. *However*, when I asked her about the other amount she owes me, about $770, for her half of bills and rent she wasn't able to pay for the most recent due dates, she was blindsided. She basically explained to me how she didn't ask for my help with that, so she feels like she doesn't owe it to me, and reminded me that while she would rather continue living here than to move back in with her parents, she would have moved out if had she known I was expecting that money back. She said if things were flipped and I was the one that missed some bills and rent due to my financial situation, she wouldn't have expected me to pay it back even if she had to borrow the money from family. There has been a situation in the past where I was briefly without a job and she helped me stay fed during that time, and I returned the favor by covering her food costs for a while once I had a job again, but she told me tonight that she didn't expect that from me, that she was just being nice by paying for my food during that time. 

So it comes to this: if we don't sign the lease next month for another year here, we would each have to move out and go live with our respective parents. She would rather stay here, but is okay with moving out to help herself financially. I would *strongly* prefer to stay here over dealing with a certain family member, but I'm not sure if we should. I'm not sure who's in the wrong here or if we both are. We're still on good terms, but I still don't know how to feel about this.
Thanks in advance, fellow redditors!

Edit: Through the power of notifications, I've been able to read two random comments so far. Someone asked if I told her it was a loan or if I just gave her the money.
All that was said about this in the beginning was she asked me where/how I would cover what she wouldn't be able to, to which I told her how I planned to borrow a sum of money from my family. It was never given to her physically either. She would normally pay me her half of bills and rent with cash, and I would put that with my money for when those payments were due.

131,1ekfw8v,AITA for not giving a crap about the Hen party as a MOH,"My friend (24 F) recently got engaged and asked me (28 F) to be her Maid of Honour. We've been friends for about 12 years, most of which has been long-distance as I moved abroad for further studies and ended up staying abroad after finishing my masters.

Initially, I turned down the role twice because I wasn't sure I could afford the trip to her wedding, what with job changes and the £2,500 flight costs. After a fair bit of persuasion, I agreed to be her Maid of Honour after discussing her expectations: attending the rehearsal dinner, helping with wedding planning, giving a speech, managing decorations/setup on the wedding day, and even cleaning up. To cover the expenses, I started working two additional part-time jobs to save up for the wedding this autumn.

Since I live on the other side of the world, she assured me that her other friends would handle the hen, so I needn't worry about that. A few months before the wedding, though, it turned out that nothing had been planned, and she called me in tears about how no one was stepping up to organise her hen. She said she couldn’t talk to anyone else about it and that she couldn’t plan it herself because ""only losers plan their own hens"". When I offered to step aside so she could find someone closer to handle it, she had another meltdown.

So, I decided to take matters into my own hands and set up a group chat with her friends. Their enthusiasm was, to put it mildly, lacking. A few even made comments about me running things to the bride, and she didn't defend me. Instead, she relayed their comments to me and used it as an opportunity to compare herself to me, implying that I was “lazy”, while she was a “go-getter” and hard-worker. She raised concerns about how I was managing things, to which I explained that I needed a headcount before booking hotels and activities. Meanwhile, those originally supposed to be in charge were making shady comments and not contributing nor responding at all to the group chat.

The planning itself has caused a lot of strife between us, as her demands are quite superficial (e.g., she’ll only have a hen party if there are at least 9 people, we need to rent a hotel for a minimum of 2 nights, etc.), and she’s threatened to cancel if her basic needs aren’t met. I told her I needed support and couldn't handle everything on my own, to which she responded that no one could help because they were ""busy.""

134,1ekfe3m,WIBTA to wear ear plugs around my friend?,"Ever since I was young, persistent loud noises tend to give me severe headaches, often migraines if they go on for long enough. Luckily I'm not exposed to situations like that frequently. And when I am, like at a crowded bar, I bring ear plugs (or leave the area if I forget them).

I have one friend of mine who I used to occasionally see as part of a larger friend group. He has an extremely loud talking voice (it is nearly as loud as a typical person's yelling voice) and it gets even louder when he gets excited, which is often. He is aware it is extremely loud (he has made comments about it), but he seems to be unable to control it. Like if there's a situation we need to be quieter, and someone tells him to quiet down, he might get closer to talking volume for a minute or two before returning to his normal volume. Since it was meeting as a large group I could usually stay further away from him and have it not be a major issue, just a minor inconvenience.

People have graduated and moved away, and we stopped hanging out, but he has recently expressed an interest in hanging out again with the remaining few members of the friend group, including my girlfriend and myself. I think he may be a little lonely. 

We hung out together for the first time today, and both myself and my girlfriend ended up with migraines. I don't think he realized.

Here's where I could become the asshole. I brought up wearing ear plugs for future hangouts to my girlfriend, but she feels it would be pretty rude to wear them or even ask for permission to wear them when we are just hanging out at one of our houses. She especially thinks it would be bad for both of us to be wearing ear plugs, since she also gets migraines. 

is it an AH move to wear earplugs? Is it less of an AH move to just not hang out with him?

135,1ekf99d,AITA for not having a relationship with my in-laws,"AITA for not wanting a relationship with my husband’s parents

I am 26F, married a year and half ago to my husband, 29M We are Indians, and usually Indian families stay in big joint families with our parents. 

I was raised by a single mom, parents divorced early on in my childhood. Mum raised me and made me whatever I am today.

husband’s family includes his mom dad and younger brother. We’re just back from our honeymoon and my MIL starts expecting weird things from me. I should cover my head at home, wear traditional indian clothes( things like these might be stereotypical in some cultures, but I have never seen or heard of these before), act like a full time maid, cooking, doing the dishes, laundry, etc. 

I also work a full time job as an accountant, and it is very taxing on me with heavy schedules.

MIL cannot speak a word without it being a taunt. She would never answer in a straight voice, with her always trying to demean me or scold me. FIL would act like an authoritarian patriarch, ordering everyone around. I heard things from my BIL that my husband and I should not go out on dates anymore because now we ‘live in the same house’ so we do not need to go out to meet each other. The audacity and the remarks they have made can be a whole thread. 

My husband is a good person, but he is very naive and gullible. My in-laws would gaslight him often into believing that I did some act, that caused this reaction from them.

he would also, when angered; display a huge reg flag behaviour, cutting me off emotionally and just being rude and manipulative.

They have tried to create a scene by calling my mum up, and trying to set up an intervention that hey your daughter did this, she said that,etc. And they would disrespect her, say she is alone, take digs at her, and yell at her. I made it clear to my husband that this is not at all acceptable and he and his parents need to respect her.

Now, I give his parents a cordial relationship where I don’t greet them, but I also do not disrespect them. I respond to what is asked, and do not back answer even if they are being rude. I ask them what they need, but I do not go out of the way for them.

AH because- my husband feels that I am only focused on a relationship with him, and am not putting in efforts on his family. When i told him that my relationship with his parents is not entirely my fault, it is theirs too, and that this relationship is now strained, and not something for him to repair. In order to repair it, he himself is trying to strain the relationship we both share. he flipped and said i do not want to make an effort to fix things.

NTA because- I have tried to be super kind and nice to them, but they would always either taunt me or yell at me or try to control me, which does not really work with my values, which my husband knows. Also, they do not want my husband to have any relationship with my mum, they get paranoid and have caused a lot of arguments in our home whenever we go to meet her.

136,1ekf73a,AITA for “Not Respecting” My Friend’s Religion?,"Me and my friend are both 16 and have been very close for almost 4 years now and she’s known from the start I like girls. She’s straight and very committed to her religion (Orthodox Christian), and talks about issues with church, her faith in God, and the bible a lot. She’s never had a problem, even got me and a past gf together. I’ve also never been quiet about my sexuality, I’ve told her if there was a pretty girl around, sent her media things about gay people and issues related to being queer. There’s never been a problem with all of this.

A couple days ago, we had an argument about something completely unrelated: I had ignored some tiktoks she’d sent me bc she did the same, she got mad and said I shouldn’t have ignored her to be petty, I said she’d been ignoring me when I tried to bring up other more serious things through tiktoks (insecurity about my weight, feeling burnt out because of school, feeling exhausted because of dealing with the same problems as always, and generally not feeling okay) and she had completely ignored that and said that I’m “always talking about being gay” and “making it my whole personality”. I asked some other friends about this because I don’t think I’ve ever been overly-involved talking about my sexuality. They all agreed I didn’t talk about it a problematic amount. It’s also probably worth mentioning that she talks about guys A LOT. Guy’s she thinks are hot, guy problems, asking for advice on how to handle situations with guys, all that. She said she wasn’t gay so she “doesn’t know how it feels” and that it was unfair to expect a response from her. (She usually ignores me when I bring up things related to my sexuality or the topic of homosexuality at all). Then she started saying her religion wasn’t okay with it. I’ve known she doesn’t support the LGBTQ+ community but it’s never been a “thing” in our friendship. She said she’d broken a lot of rules and went against what people had said to be friends with me.

I’m an atheist and had never had a problem with her religion and completely respect her beliefs but this looked like her blatantly being homophobic and trying to justify it with religion, as well as trying to deflect from the actual issue at the beginning of the argument. It was a very big fight and we haven’t spoken since and it doesn’t look like we will soon. AITA?

137,1ekf09p,AITA for asking my brother to stop hanging out with me and my friends?,"I (f) have been in a trio (one m one f) for the past 4-5 years now and until 2 years ago my brother (1 yr older than me and is going into college) didn't try to hangout with us 3.

Bsf1 (f) lives about a 24hr drive away (she moved away 4 years ago), bsf2 (m) lives down the street. Bsf1 had just came down to visit us today nd we plan on hanging out again on friday (with my brother of course).

About 5 months ago my brother began going on runs with bsf2 almost daily and before that (2 yrs ago) he would hang out with me and bsf2 during lunch at school even though he has his own friends. but that doesn't bother me all that much, what  does bother me is that whenever we (my fam and bsf2s fam) go to visit bsf1 or she visit us, he never hesitates to hang out with all of us every time we go out and even gets my parents involved when I say I don't want him to. He always replies w ""i want to see my boy"" (bsf2) when he literally lives down the street and can hang w him at any given time. Also, he is not close with bsf1 and i know he doesn't like her because he has a gf.

I haven't been able to hang out with just my 2 friends in a year because of this (we get about three total irl hangouts a year) and I always get yelled at by my parents because ""I don't want to spend time with my brother"". Don't get me wrong, I love my brother but he's definitely not my friend and he’s def not part of our trio.

Whenever he comes to hang out with me and my friends he's always finding a way to make fun of me or just be mean to make me look bad. Like, I'm pretty into kpop so he always talks about how I have extremely high standards and only like Asians (which is not true and l'm VERY vocal about it). He also says that I won't be able to get my dream ""kpop boyfriend"" because I am too unhealthy and I'm gonna die early (he brought this up about five times today during our hangout). All because I like to eat a lot of hot chips and I was having some during our conversation with bsf1/2 and their siblings. Even so, I am not actually unhealthy and I function fine. Usually when he says things like that I feel a bit awkward but I just listen and move on.

Anyways, even when I look at the relationships my bsfs have with their siblings I feel a little jealous because when their siblings joke around with them it's always light hearted but when my brother tries to ""poke fun at me"", he does it in a way to get me mad which I know he does it on purpose.

He'll do things to annoy me in front of friends or family to get a reaction out of me (he knows I get annoyed easily) to embarrass me.

When we are alone we don't talk much but we usually get along fine, but, the second it's us and a third party, he completely switches up and acts the way he does.

There's a few main people in this story: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. There's a lot of small stuff but I've tried to emphasize and figure things out, but I'm currently conflicted over the state things are in.

A, B, C and I are all good friends. I've only had a little problem with one of them, but we talked through it and it never came up again. D, E, and F are okay, but recently they have been really mean and judging and bullying people based off looks, weight, and assumptions which makes me uncomfortable. G is the one I'm most uncomfortable with. She's part of another friend group, and badmouths them to us a lot, which I found really suspicious. I recently found out she's been doing the same to everyone in our group as well, which although not surprising, disappointing. G also has made comments about me being annoying behind my back, but also I understand I'm not everyone likes me and that's okay! I don't however love people forcing themselves to be my friend/be fake to me. There's a lot of small things G has done/allegedly has done, but they've always been small conflicts and either they're talked out or she ignores it and doesn't respond so we can't resolve it.

Last night, G and maybe D and E, drove to A and B's houses and threw cheese on their cars. At first we thought it was just some guy that had broken up with our friend in the group, but B checked her cameras and realized it was a girl running from her driveway. She also noticed that the car parked farther down that the mystery girl ran to looked a lot like G's car. We checked our life360 and realized that G, D, and E had all turned their locations off in the early afternoon. This, plus G and D ditching on a hangout this weekend, led A, B, and C to believe that they were the ones who did it. A texted G's mom to ask, and then made a group chat with all of the girls involved and said they need to talk things out and settle past and current drama. None have responded, but D texted another girl privately and said that our whole friend group was the reason she was having mental health problems the past few months.

My first thought on all that happened is: That was really dumb. Not replying isn't helping their case either. It's so dumb, could it really be them? I also don't know how to feel about D, because I want to help, but throughout the months she never reached out, and also continued to instigate drama.

139,1ekem6w,AITA for snapping at my 15yo cousin and not acting like an adult? ,"Okay so maybe my cousin Josh’s (15m) current behaviour is puberty but he’s been acting crazy. His mom told us that he got into some trouble so she can’t leave him alone at home so my mom offered to watch him. 

I thought it’d be fine but he has way too much energy. Which would be fine but he’ll randomly start running up and down the stairs and while he’s doing that, he refuses to let anyone else on the stairs or else he’ll throw a tantrum. Then he’ll just… open and close taps over and over again. Same with the stove, lights, the windows, and doors. And this one time while we were eating dinner he just stood up and threw all his food onto the carpet in my bedroom. And he just laughs! Not to mention the fact that he’ll start fighting with me over stupid shit like the TV volume or my outfit choices.

The other day, I was in my room trying to do work and he stormed in and started opening and closing my window. I immediately asked him to get out and leave me alone but the weirdo started jumping on my bed and singing some stupid song. I yelled at him to stop bothering me and he immediately went “you’re such a buzzkill, no wonder your bf left you” to which I responded “yeah and no wonder your dad left, you annoying piece of shit.” 

Well guess who bursted out crying. My mom immediately ran in and started yelling at me asking me what I did and when I tried to explain to her she told me I crossed the line and should’ve acted like the adult I am instead of lashing out at a child. When my dad came home he got upset too and well my aunt was especially angry and said I need to watch myself.

But I can’t take it anymore and anyone would’ve snapped having to deal with him. 

My parents told me to have more empathy for him and that he’s going through a tough time which okay fine but why does that give him the right to irritate me? And besides who cries like that at 15? Hell who even acts like him at the age?? I really don’t think I’m wrong but everyone else does and I suppose I reacted immaturely. I snapped. AITA? ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-05,"AITA for snapping at my 15yo cousin and not acting like an adult?  Okay so maybe my cousin Josh’s (15m) current behaviour is puberty but he’s been acting crazy. His mom told us that he got into some trouble so she can’t leave him alone at home so my mom offered to watch him. 

I thought it’d be fine but he has way too much energy. Which would be fine but he’ll randomly start running up and down the stairs and while he’s doing that, he refuses to let anyone else on the stairs or else he’ll throw a tantrum. Then he’ll just… open and close taps over and over again. Same with the stove, lights, the windows, and doors. And this one time while we were eating dinner he just stood up and threw all his food onto the carpet in my bedroom. And he just laughs! Not to mention the fact that he’ll start fighting with me over stupid shit like the TV volume or my outfit choices.

The other day, I was in my room trying to do work and he stormed in and started opening and closing my window. I immediately asked him to get out and leave me alone but the weirdo started jumping on my bed and singing some stupid song. I yelled at him to stop bothering me and he immediately went “you’re such a buzzkill, no wonder your bf left you” to which I responded “yeah and no wonder your dad left, you annoying piece of shit.” 

Well guess who bursted out crying. My mom immediately ran in and started yelling at me asking me what I did and when I tried to explain to her she told me I crossed the line and should’ve acted like the adult I am instead of lashing out at a child. When my dad came home he got upset too and well my aunt was especially angry and said I need to watch myself.

Background: I(m38) live close to my sister (F46). Her son is going to college this year. So she wanted to buy a puppy. I had said that I would help her out with the puppy since her husband and kids don’t. So she bought the puppy last month and I have been helping her to take care of it daily. I work remote thus I spend time taking care of the puppy while my sister is at work during week days and I spend my evening puppy sitting whenever her family is out during the evenings. Today I was just chilling by myself when my sister called and asked me when I was coming. I said I can come at 6:30 and leave by 9:30pm . She said I need to come earlier as she wants to go to her son’s dorm which is like an hour away.

141,1ekejkg,AITA for getting mad over a project?,"This happened in college when I (22M) took up Nursing and, in one subject, we had Psychological Nursing. Once, we had a project about Therapeutic Communication. This activity is like writing a script involving a partner where one acts as the nurse and the other a mentally-ill patient and we had to construct dialogues about mental illnesses and discuss the type of ego defense mechanism or therapeutic communication technique. My class was an odd number of students and I was the odd one out so I did the project alone. 

After submission, I was called into the guidance counselor because they said my submission was “too realistic” and that, because I made it alone, she says *it’s unlikely I made dialogues because no sane person could have their mind respond to them in a conversation*. Like how some mentally-ill patients have voices in their head.

I have had experience writing script settings and dialogues in the past so I know how these things go. I used to write plots and dialogues for a comic my friends and I worked on in middle school. The guidance counselor informed my parents and teachers that I could possibly have schizophrenia or some other mental illness. 

This is the part that made me mad. Suddenly, everyone feels worried about me and my decision making. I’m not reckless and have never tried doing the dumb things students do in college. I just study, read manga, watch anime, and play RPGs. 

I have not experienced any of these mental diagnoses and felt that I just did what was asked of me for the project since I don’t have a partner. I felt angry as people label me now as someone mentally unwell. I already told them I did what I did and that’s just it. They still think I’m suffering from some random illness.

143,1ekeid6,AITA for not taking my grandmothers bed set I said I would take 2 years ago?,"My aunt asked me 2 years ago when I was living with her to take my grandmothers bed set. I said I would at the time if I could fit it all, being that my grandma just died of Covid, it was a decent quality set, would save me some money and I had also just sold my house (bad breakup) I figured sure if I can take it for my aunt, plus the sentimental value it would be great. 

Fast forward post Covid house prices have gone insane.  However 2 years later I bought a new house. Problem is the bedrooms are super small, not even a real master bedroom but in my tiny home at least I got half an acre outside right? Unfortunately the set barely fits and is made for a much larger house. Also my girlfriend and I who are now living together would really much like to get a smaller set that would better fit the space but that we also picked.


Anyway my aunt is flipping out because she’s storing it at my deceased grandmas best friends house who is a family friend. This friend used to always take, store and give my grandmas stuff to her own kids(grandma gave this lady a lot of expensive furniture  when she downsized, aka they were best friends) and I generally thought she was fine keeping this furniture like she did in the past if it didn’t work out/ I could never afford to buy a house.

Anyway I offered to pay someone to remove said furniture from our family friends house and dispose of it if she doesn’t want it there anymore.

I also told my aunt when I can afford a bigger space I am eventually going to sell this house as I bought it on my own (could afford something much bigger once gf and I are married but I’m not buying anything together until than) and if our family friend will hold it longer and doesn’t mind I would deff take it for one of the bedrooms in the bigger space.

I just don’t understand how my aunt thinks I broke a promise. Yes I said I’d take it under duress during a horrible death in the family and my breakup from my ex fiancé which caused me to have to sell all my possessions…. 

However I had no idea what / if I could ever afford a new house, what my now new partner would like/ dislike, size of new house, layout, location, etc. there were a lot of uncontrollable factors here and unfortunately my house is 900 sq ft with closets for bedrooms and I also want my partner to be able to choose our shared bedroom set and honestly she hates it… (but would take it to avoid this nuclear meltdown). 

I think offering to dispose said furniture or asking our family friend if she can hold it longer are appropriate. She got 2 10k leather Italian couches (which she wanted) because I can’t fit them here and she needed a couch so I feel like she wouldn’t mind holding the furniture a bit longer. I also offered to pay back my aunt for moving it in the first place but she refused and got more mad and reality is she would have had to pay someone to move it anyway … AITA?

My bio parents never really took care of me, so my adoptive grandparents raised me. My dad's mom often criticizes how I was raised, calling me closed-minded and lazy, and constantly blaming my adoptive grandparents for everything.

She cried, saying, ""If I was raised with respect, I wouldn’t be yelling at her."" I was raised with respect, but only for those who deserve it. Frankly, shitting on a dead man's name is not the way to get respect.

145,1eke64u,AITA for not moving states for my MIL who is dying?,"Here’s some background: my (32F) partner (34M), Paul, and I have been together for 10+ years. During that time we have seen his mother a handful of times. Even when she lived 20 minutes away we would never go visit her. And also he has gone through months-long stretches of time where he won’t talk to her at all because she’s done something to upset him (said inappropriate racist things, didn’t get vaccinated, etc.). I don’t really like her as a person, so I haven’t encouraged us to see her, but anytime he has wanted to see her in the past I have supported him. The reason he only saw her occasionally was because she was a bad mom. She dated guys who hurt him and his siblings. She dated guys who would do drugs around him and his siblings. When he was in HS she moved out of state because her bf had a warrant out for his arrest, and she left Paul behind to live with a neighbor. She didn’t have an easy life, but she never took care of her children the way they deserved.

She recently got diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. She was originally told she has 1-3 years left to live. We have been on a couple large family vacations in the last couple months so the whole family can spend time with her. Now there have been complications with getting her chemo started. And it basically seems like her prognosis keeps getting shorter. We’ve gone to visit her in her state a few times too. She lives about a 6 hour drive/1 hour flight away. And lives in a state that I hate. I would absolutely hate to live there.

Now he is suggesting we break our lease and move ourselves and our pets to a new state so we can be closer to her. And when we move back, we’ll have to find a new place to live, which would also suck because I love where we live right now. I understand he wants to see her more often, but I don’t. I have suggested we can fly/drive there every other weekend. And that also gives me the option to not go there and see her all the time. Even if we did move, I don’t believe we would see her during the week, only on the weekends, so it doesn’t make sense to me to even be there during the week. Paul’s younger sister also lives in the same state as their mom, and he wants to be there to support her. I am good friends with his younger sister, but I still think I could be a decent support system for her if I saw her twice a month at the least. 

Some other selfish reasons I don’t want to move. Where we live is by the beach, perfect weather all year round, the new state is a constant 100 degrees. My family lives within 30 minutes of here and I don’t want to miss seeing my nieces/nephews grow up.

I say he developed this habit while we were living together because he never did this while living at his parents. He’s gotten into this habit of leaving trash out and virtually never throwing it away even if he’s a few feet away from the trash can. He does the same thing with dirty clothes. Even right now there’s a pair of dirty jeans sitting on the kitchen table and a dirty shirt on the couch from when he was changing to go to the gym.

149,1ekctuu,AITA for fighting with my mom over a Yeti,"My mom has a history of taking my things. From the time I was 11/12 y/o. Makeup, clothing, you name it. She'd take it and ruin it. 

Im now 30 y/o and my mom now lives with me. She's been here for a few years now. She still has a habit of taking things and losing them or breaking them, which is STILL super annoying. One of the biggest annoyances I have as is tumbler cups. I usually buy the cheap ones and she takes them over almost immediately. I keep buying them and she keeps losing the straws or lids... or just the whole cup.

So I invested in a Yeti. I told her the day I bought it: ""this cup is MINE. Feel free to use any of the others... but this one is off limits."" I laid down the law right from the beginning. (Note: she also has things that she's asked me not to touch, and I have respected that)

One day, she took it upon herself to go into my room (kinda weird) and grab my Yeti off my nightstand to take it downstairs and wash it. I explained to her again, that's my cup. While appreciated, it's got a little magnetic piece on the lid that pops off and I don't want it lost. We all know by now that she has a habit of losing things so I thought by reexplaining that, I'd get the point across.

My sons birthday party was yesterday and we all went camping. She showed up to the party with her drink in, you guessed it, my freakin' Yeti. I looked right at her and called her out right away. I told her that was a jerk move. She looked at my Uncle that was sitting next to me and started mocking me. I told her when she leaves the party she was to take it home and leave it there. So I ended up letting her use it for the day. 

We got back from the camping trip today and she said she was headed to my cousins house for a cookout. While I finished unpacking, I decided to get out and take the dogs for a walk with my son. I went to grab my Yeti for water and I couldn't find it anywhere. I searched the whole house. Gone. I called her and I asked her if she had it and she nonchalantly said ""Yeah, why?"". That's when I finally got heated. I asked her what could have possibly made her think that it was okay to take it and she tried to turn the entire thing on me. She asked me if something was going on in my life that was making me act this way and said that I was acting ""crazy"" and ""out of my mind"".

I explained to her that this is about the principle of it all. The consistent lack of respect and not even 24 hours she was back to doing the exact thing I asked her not to do.

When she came back, she refused to take any type of accountability/apologize. She tried to gaslight me and I yanked my cup out of her hand. She then ran up to her room. Her signature move when faced with conflict is to deflect as much as possible before you back down and if that fails-cry. So she started crying and called me toxic/crazy, before grabbing her dog and running out of the house/speeding away in her car.

So for background, my brother has a job, some savings, he hangs out with friends/chats them up online. He dropped out of high school when he was very close to graduating. My mother and I tried talking to him about the time he was going to drop out, since he wasnt doing his school work, and he broke diwn crying about how he thinks he's stupid. And even now he seems depressed. He'll get into moods where he's very aggressive/short/annoyed. Sometimes if for example, me him and my mom are all listening to some tunes on the tv, he'll sometimes change it to a depressing song, such as NF - Let you down. And we tell him straight up that this isn't the vibe, but he has done this multiple times. Or sometimes he'll make comments in the videos, such as in Post Malone's song ""Mourning"" Post says ""Don't wanna sober up... thought I was strong enough..."" and he'll make a comment like ""guess I wasn't strong enough"". Or he'll make (what I assume to be) exaggerated comments about how good life is. I've tried telling him he should listen to happier music rather than what he listens to, but he says he likes the sad music more

Ever since he's turned 21, he's been very into drinking. Not an every day thing from what I see, but he acts like a completely different person/very outgoing once he gets drinking. He's had many bouts of laying on the bathroom floor from throwing up.

With that, his room is also a mess. I've taken the liberty of cleaning it twice and he's dirtied it up again. Never vacuums, cans of pop and alcohol everywhere, clothes everywhere, plates with food from days ago, etc. He also doesn't time his chores very well such as taking out the trash, or cleaning out the dishwasher as it'll take him days to do it. He doesn't practice hygiene very well as he'll take a shower maybe every other day (he needs more because he has terrible acne everywhere unfortunately).

He went to the gym with me once due to him getting a lot of anxiety/emotions when he and this girl he was talking to broke up (they were also coworkers so he had to see her). I was very stoked to have him work out with me since he woukd have a healthy hobby, but soon after he never asked again, and when I asked him he said he's happy with his body.

Today him, me, and my mom went to see a movie, all was well. Then we go to eat, and he appears fine. But once we sit down and order some drinks, he starts talking about like he needs it right now, he still appears fine. But then he becomes very closed off and ticked like something was bothering him very badly. He went into his phone the entire time, and when my mom tried prying him, he didn't want to talk about it and he talked about how he shouldn't have ever come. He then asked for the keys to the car so he could sit, and then downed his drink. When I talked with her later, she said he looked like he was about to cry.

With all this, I wonder if I lack sympathy for him somewhat. I feel bad for him and want to help him when he gets like this as I imagine he's figuring out his feelings. But I start to get into the mindset of tough love when he doesn't do better for himself and he keeps engaging in his unhealthy living/trying to improve his mind state. This has been going on for years and I feel like he resents me somewhat for it because he always gets moody when I bring up the chores, or even trying to better himself in general/it goes in one ear out the other.

I \[19/f\] share a room with my sister \[17/f\]. My sister and I usually get along well, despite us having completely different personalities, and sometimes we argue, but all siblings do that. Our most recent arguments were about her pet. We used to have a cat, and she adored it, but it died a year back from natural causes. I've consoled her, and I've been with her while she cried over it. Unlike my sister, I don't like pets. I don't like cats in particular, there's no specific reason, but I just don't like them.

But I had laid some rules months before when our parents gave her the okay about the cat, I said that I don't want the cat to sleep in our room, and that its toilet shouldn't be kept here, because quite honestly, I can't handle the stench, I don't mind if she plays around with it in the room, or if it stays during daytime, I don't want its toilet, nor for it to sleep here. She agreed, she said she'll figure it out. However, the cat's here now, and she's telling me that it'll sleep in our room, and as if that's not enough, the toilets in here too.

She's arguing with me now saying that I'm dramatic, and that I should handle it until they get a cage, and figure out where to let it sleep, but we've had an agreement for months, and I genuinely don't like the fact that its toilet is here more than anything.

Yesterday, my partner (23M) went out for dinner with his friend, and I (22F) had the idea of preparing some food for myself. I was thinking of making some sort of barbecue marinated tofu, and I mentioned something about how I would experiment with tofu or something like that while driving him to the restaurant, and that there might be an experiment waiting for him at home. He didn't seem very interested and responded fairly noncommittally, so I thought that if I made enough, I could set aside a portion for him whenever he got back, but since he didn't seem that interested, no big deal. 

The catch is: we're in the middle of moving, and some of the ingredients are at our other place. While stopping by there to grab what I needed, I ran into a mutual friend/roommate of ours who happened to also be hungry. They suggested coming back with me to the other place and having some food as well, and I had no problem with it, so I said sure.

We ended up cooking some BBQ tofu, nothing special. The food was ready right around when my partner called asking me to pick him and his friend up. In a hurry to meet them, our mutual friend and I just basically divvied what we made into two bowls, wrapped them up, and brought them with us. My partner didn't seem to care when they noticed the food we had.

After we got back home, while my partner was in the shower, I decided to make some food. On the drive back home, my partner had mentioned he wasn't hungry, so I figured I didn't need to ask, and cooked some plain pasta and added some jarred Pomodoro sauce to it.

When my partner saw the food, he asked me why I didn't ask him if he wanted some before starting to make the food. I replied that he said he wasn't hungry, but if he wanted, I could make more pasta. He said it was normal in his family to ask if someone wanted a portion before they started making something, and he was upset that I had made meals twice in the day without caring to ask or save some for him. He also said that when I had said ""there might be an experiment waiting for you when you get back"", he had assumed I would save a portion for him.

I thought he would not care since the first time, he was already out getting food with his friend, and the second time, he had said he wasn't hungry earlier. When I brought this up to him, his response was ""that was an hour ago!"" and he said I should have asked regardless. Admittedly, when he called to request a pickup, I was just focused on quickly packing up and getting to the car, and forgot in my haste to set aside a third portion.

At the start of this, I thought you didn't need to ask before making yourself food if others wanted any, but now I'm not really sure. I'm kind of terrible at telling how to behave in situations like this and the way I grew up certainly did not encourage asking about food like this. AITA? How do I make this right?

Edit: I didn’t expect this to blow up. I’ve been responding to comments and clarifying details so I figured I should edit to add some context and information:

- My partner was mad at me not for making the food itself, but mostly for not asking him if he wanted some before starting to make food both times. He said that it shows I didn’t think of him when making the food and that it was expected that I should ask him if he wants some. He claimed that I should have set aside a portion of the tofu for him because I had already told him about the “experiment”.

- He did not ask if I wanted anything from the restaurant, nor did he bring anything back. He also didn’t invite me because I’m not friends with the person he had dinner with (nothing bad happened, just don’t know them well). I didn’t really have an issue with not being invited or brought food.

- Some people have asked about the driving thing. He does not have a car or license, so I’m the only one able to drive us around. He has a bike and our transit is fairly good (for the US anyway). Typically I’ll drive to his work, between our places, and if we need to go do errands.

- l did not intend to invite mutual friend over - they just happened to be hungry and ask if they could have some of the tofu I made. I said sure because I had no issue with it.


",Not the A-hole,2024-08-05,"AITA for not making my partner food when I made food? I originally thought this was no big deal but now I'm second-guessing myself.

Yesterday, my partner (23M) went out for dinner with his friend, and I (22F) had the idea of preparing some food for myself. I was thinking of making some sort of barbecue marinated tofu, and I mentioned something about how I would experiment with tofu or something like that while driving him to the restaurant, and that there might be an experiment waiting for him at home. He didn't seem very interested and responded fairly noncommittally, so I thought that if I made enough, I could set aside a portion for him whenever he got back, but since he didn't seem that interested, no big deal.

155,1ekcgrz,AITA for leaving a note about my neighbors kids smacking balls into my back yard??,"I live in a typical neighborhood, we have decent sized back yards, not huge. I love to come home and decompress after work with my pups, in the quiet.

Less than a year ago (but over six months) I got new next door neighbors, who have a couple kids (about 8, and 10 yrs old.) After a few months, their kids started smacking balls into my back yard. They will then come over and ring the doorbell to ask for their balls back. Which wasn’t a problem… at first. I totally understand when you’re kid and you’re playing, it happens!

Fast forward to recently. The amount of balls they are smacking over the fence has become excessive. In my opinion, at least. Oh and in case anyone is wondering they are both baseballs and wiffleballs.   

The reason this irritates me is two fold. The first being, it drives one of my dogs NUTS. It freaks her out, and then the kids climb up the fence and lean over looking to see where they landed. Which also freaks her out. To the point where she is jumping as high as she possibly can up the fence, and she’s getting older and doesn’t always land on her feet. Twice I have had to take her to the emergency vet bc she has injured herself, landing on her hip/tail. 

The second reason is that it’s happening so often that it’s becoming an inconvenience. Either they are ringing my doorbell to get their balls back, or my other dog grabs them, brings them in thru the doggy door, and I have to stop what I’m doing to try to get them away from her before she chews them up. 

Last week I got home from a business trip, and within a day and a half they smacked 4 balls into my backyard. The first one they came over immediately for, rang my doorbell at 8pm. The next two my dog brought in through the dog door, so I took from my dog, went out back and threw back over the fence. The 4th ball, I left on their front porch with the following note:

“Hi neighbors, hope life is well! I just wanted to return this ball and ask if the kiddos can be mindful about not smacking so many balls into my back yard. It freaks one of my furbabies out. :( I appreciate it and hope your furbabies are well!”

I’m not a confrontational person, but it gives my pup anxiety, which bothers me. I thought I would be nice about it, because the last thing I want is a bad neighbor relationship. As I have been typing this.. in the last 10 minutes they have smacked another 2 balls over here. I’m about to pull my hair out. AITA?

156,1ekce29,AITA For hiring a security guard to prevent certain people from coming?,"Here’s a bit of background about me: I'm Asian American, and in my culture, it's common for people who know the family, or are friends of the family or friends of friends, to invite themselves to weddings. That’s been my experience.

However, my partner and I aren’t comfortable with this tradition. So, for our wedding, we decided to send out invitation cards only to friends and family whom we actually know, to prevent random guests from showing up. We also hired a guest list coordinator to ensure that only those with invitation cards could attend.

From my perspective, I’ve seen people or family who clearly don’t know the bride and groom show up just for the food. They would only arrive when food was served, take as much as they could fit into containers, and leave before the event was over. If there was alcohol, wine, or beer, they would take those too. I found this behavior really disrespectful.

On the wedding day, everything was going smoothly until one of the staff informed me that there was a commotion outside and that my cousin wanted to speak with me. It turned out that my cousin's family had invited their friends.

I explained to my cousin that our guest list coordinator was doing their job and that if their friends hadn’t received an invitation, they couldn’t be admitted. My cousin’s family and their friends argued with me about why they needed an invitation, claiming it was tradition, so I should let them in. I stood my ground and asked, 'Is this my wedding or yours?' I also told them that if they couldn’t respect how the wedding was planned, then they weren’t welcome. In the end, they gave up and didn’t attend.

The wedding went well, and I put the incident behind me. Now, a week later, my cousin is bad-mouthing me for not letting their friends in and accusing me of being 'westernized' (whatever that means). This situation has escalated to the point where our elders have intervened, telling us that we were wrong for not admitting them. My wife and I are frustrated and unsure if we were in the wrong or not.

157,1ekc5zm,AITA for arguing with my gf because I invited her to an event and she left to go eat elsewhere? ,"My girlfriend (26f) and I (30m) have been arguing since yesterday about this. 

Context on my girlfriend: she’s fit, takes her gym seriously and has a healthy lifestyle which means she doesn’t eat everything or whatever. I consider this to be a bit excessive since I do workout but I eat whatever I want. But it’s her choice so I leave her do what she wants. 

I invited her to a martial arts event where we were watching some friends of mine fight. She’s not a super fan of MMA sports but she accepted my invitation because she wanted to be with me. The event was at 7, we arrived at 7:30 but it started an hour later. Before going she asked me what we would eat and I said I didn’t know - we should just go and see what we can have there.

We arrived and noticed there was only hot dogs and fast food, which I offered her if she wanted something - I’d pay for it, she said no. She asked what was nearby and I said a mall. She then told me she was gonna grab quick some food over there and be right back.

I was angry at her for leaving and simply not eating the food that was offered there. Everyone was eating there. She just left and grabbed food elsewhere, came back 30 mins later. I was mad she left me alone just because she craved or wanted another type of food. 

Once we got home I told her how mad I was at her for doing that when she could be a bit more flexible with her food and just eat what’s being offered. I told her going out with her was trouble and a headache because she was never flexible. I admit I was angry and could’ve used better words - but she does have a problem with adapting to an environment she doesn’t feel comfortable in.

158,1ekbvrc,AITA for having an issue with my 14 year old son being responsible for babysitting his 5&7yr old step siblings?,"Backstory, me and ex wife have 50/50 custody of our 14 year old, and this is the way it’s been since he was 2. Everything down the middle, no child support, a week with me, a week with her. I’ve been single this entire time while this is my ex’s second serious relationship since our divorce. Overall, we get along great, and we co-parent well together.

Anyways, after my ex having a long distance relationship with this person for the last year, he moved in this summer with his 2 kids who are 5 and 7. That’s fine, that’s great. The issue I have is my son is having to babysit on the weeks that he is over there while they work their jobs in the daytime. I found out through my son, who isn’t thrilled about it.

My son is responsible and smart, but he’s an only child, has never had to be responsible and watch younger kids, doesn’t have much experience with younger kids, struggles to feed and water our Lab without reminders, and while he has had 2 step siblings in the past, one was a year younger and the other was a year older than him and babysitting was always arranged when necessary because they were much younger at the time of that serious relationship involving my ex.

My ex and I briefly talked about this before the move in. She had contacted me wanting to know if I still had our old babysitters number, if I knew if she was still in the business. I gave her the number and she explained she needed it for the 2 step kids for when her and bf are working once he moves in. I asked if that also included when our son was at her house, and she said yes. I explained how that was probably a good idea, because the last thing a 14 year old wants is to be responsible for babysitting kids during his summer break.

AITA for not at all being happy about this? Am I overreacting for wanting to put my foot down and tell her our son should have no responsibility taking care of those kids and they need to find a sitter? I haven’t said anything to my ex yet. While we do get along, part of it is because I hold back on a lot of things that irritate me, so we can have a civil and good relationship. In the beginning of our separation, we made each others lives hell and it was exhausting, with the lawyers pairing us up against eachother and everything else. But for the last 10 years or so, it’s been pretty peaceful.

EDIT: so a couple things. I did find out from my son after posting this that he gets $20 a day. A lot of people have been asking if he was getting paid so I shot him a text and asked.

Also, I’ll be speaking with the ex today when I go over to pick up my son for the week. I’ll have another update here tonight in this space.

EDIT 2: Sorry, so after reading a few responses and private messages with recommendations, that because I’ll have my son for the next week starting today, I’ll work on getting more info from son, I’ll talk to my attorneys office, and have a solid backup plan before talking to my ex about this. Because in case the conversation goes south, I’ll at least be prepared to talk to her about a modification or more and if need be, everything will be ready for serving purposes. 

I’ll be going to the office on Wednesday to discuss with my attorney’s partners. She has busy week in family court, out of town, it is what it is. The few times I’ve had to lean on the partners has always been a good experience so this should be to. Thank you all for the positive support, and even the few criticisms that I’ve received.

160,1ekbepo,AITA for making my husband give our daughter the money gifted to us for her future?," Me (26F) and my husband (32M) had a baby in July of 2023. We had announced a little before Christmas of ‘22 that we were expecting and our families were ecstatic at the news. I have always wanted to be a mom, since I was a small child. My Father-In-Law was so ecstatic at the news that he gifted us $4,000 for Christmas to help with medical bills and for the baby. 
 My Father-In-Law is a half owner of a multi state, multi million dollar business, of which my husband is slated to take over with his sister sometime next year. In our state it is a requirement to have a social security number prior to opening a bank account, which my daughter in utero did not have. Therefore, it was agreed to enter the money in our joint account until after our daughter was born. I don’t monitor this joint account because it’s at my husband’s bank, not mine. 
 To pay for medical costs associated with her birth, I had used my HSA, covering the full amount by myself. I also created her a bank account through my bank, which my husband was supposed to be a trustee on, but failed to sign the paperwork in time, so my dad was designated instead.  
 Today while driving home from an event, I asked about the $4K, considering our daughter is a year old, and asked for permission to withdraw the funds and enter it into our daughtpers legitimate account. My husband started claiming that I already used the money for medical bills, and that I cashed it into my personal account. I told him that I did not do that and showed him my account from that time period. 
 He said that if it was in the joint account it is gone, and that he used it towards hunting land, which I didn’t give the okay to drop that money towards. He then called me ridiculous for even bringing it up, and that our baby isn’t entitled to that money as it was for medical expenses and care of her which he barely pays anything towards. I pay 75% of daycare costs, and all of grocery bills including formula/milk, and the baby is covered under my healthcare plan as his health  plan is awful from his families business. We split our mortgage 50/50, but I was the one who paid for the entire down payment. 
 The whole situation  was brought up when it did, as I am beginning to struggle to make ends meet, and have been unable to transfer money every paycheck to our daughter’s account. I’ve been putting $150 away a paycheck, as I want to be able to help her get a car/go to college if she so chooses. I explained this, and my husband accused me of blowing through the money again and refuses to check.

161,1ekba1m,AITA for trying to put the birthday boy and his wife in the center of a group of 14?,"On Saturday, my family and I gathered for dinner to celebrate my brother’s 34th birthday. We were a party of 14. Key members include myself (45f), my bro (34m) and his wife (28ish?f) [let’s call them George and Mary], my mom (70f) and her husband, and three of my kids (17-23). It may be worth noting that George & Mary were married at the start of January, and there is somewhat relevant backstory that I will include in a comment should anyone wish more info.

When I arrived, there were 3 people there; I came with 4 people including myself. The table was a single long rectangle, which means that whoever sat at the end would not be able to converse with the folks at the other end. Usually that was the last people to arrive; George, Mary, my mom, and their parties had not yet arrived. (Our adult stepbrother arrived between the two parties.)

I immediately suggested rearranging seating so that George and Mary would be in the center of the group, so everyone could chat with them. The people already there agreed, and my husband and two of my children, who had already sat down, started moving.

While we were shuffling seats, George and Mary arrived. I tried to wave them to the middle of the table and was blown off. Then Mary mentioned that my mom wanted to sit next to George. My mom was already 20 minutes late; we usually tell her that we are doing something half an hour before we do it  because she is consistently 30 minutes late. I said, “well she should have arrived on time.”

I later clarified with Mary that what she had said was that my mom was the one who wanted to sit next to George, not her mom and not that George wanted to sit next to our mom. 

We were all finished and leaving by 6.

Everything seemed fine until 11 last night, when I got a 5 paragraph text from Mary. She said she wanted to have a “conversation” “as it’s important to me to address things directly when they arise.” She brought up the sour grapes from her wedding dinner (no assigned seating), when she accused me of “took it upon myself to orchestrate those seating arrangements…Unfortunately the same thing happened today” - I took it upon myself to orchestrate seating” without consulting with her. She told me this was unacceptable because “it’s vital that the focus remains on the person being celebrated and that their wishes are being respected.” At no point did George - who is very vocal - complain to me.

162,1ekb4vt,WIBTA if I continue to hold a grudge against my future inlaws?,"  I (26F), and my fiance (""Brad"" 24M) live together with Brad's parents and one of his older brothers, (""Arthur"" 26M). I want to stress that this is in no way a permanent arrangement, we're just staying there while we save for a down-payment on a house.

Generally speaking, the living situation isn't terrible, there's just one thing I can't get over: Arthur has been severly neglecting his dog for the last 6 years, everyone in the family knew and no one did anything. When I say severe neglect, I mean it was to the point that the dog was forced to live in her own waste with no access to food or clean water. Naturally I expressed my disgust and abject horror at the living conditions of the dog, and Brad said he felt the same way, he just had no idea what to do because his parents won't let the dog inside and Arthur throws a fit whenever someone tries to take care of the dog. I told Brad I didn't really give a shit if Arthur throws a hissy fit, I was taking care of the dog and Brad agreed to help me. (Please don't attack Brad, he's learned and grown a lot since we first started dating).

Brad and I slowly worked in to bringing her inside; I could tell his parents were kind of pissed about it but no one said anything. I asked Brad to speak with Arthur about us just taking the dog, as I felt Brad would know how to best handle the situation.
Boy, was I wrong.
Brad texted Arthur and just came right out and told him the dog wasn't his anymore. (Yeah not cool, I know). Arthur deflected the whole thing and turned it back on Brad. I became defensive of Brad, and admittedly, I escalated things by getting involved and telling Arthur he had 6 years to decide he wanted to take care of his dog, and he began screaming at me to shut the fuck up, calling me a bitch, and saying he was going to call the police on me for animal theft. 

Things got so bad I had to call my future MIL and tell her to come home immediately. When she got there she sat us all down ""as adults"" and scolded us for letting a dog come between family. Arthur was made to apologize to Brad (not me), and future MIL said that Arthur got to decide if he wanted the dog or not, but I could keep taking caring for her the way I had been.

Brad tells me that he doesn't care what anyone says, as far as he's concerned the dog is ours and she's coming with us when we move out, so really the situation is only as temporary as us living there; I just can't find a way to forgive Arthur for neglecting his dog for her entire life and acting like a spoiled brat about the whole thing, and I can't find a way to forgive his parents for not only enabling his neglect, but even allowing it to happen in the first place.

163,1ekazpx,WIBTA if I kicked out my roommate for being a long-term mess?,"There's a lot of backstory here so bear with me.

I (26F) bought a house in February. While house hunting, I discussed with Megan (29NB) about being a roommate, which they agreed to. Megan and I went on a few dates back in 2020, and they asked me to be their girlfriend, but I had to move and said we'd stay in contact. 4 years went by, I decided to move back, and figured we can get to know each other again and see where things go. We discussed what would happen if we decided not to date, what we would do if we dated and broke up, etc. It seemed convenient for both of us: they needed a new place, and I needed a roommate since I'm terrified of fire. I thought I was being pretty clear that I wasn't sure if we'd end up together or not.

Megan moved in in early March (rent-free, since they were doing me a favor by watching over the house.) Then I met my now-boyfriend. Once things started to turn serious with him, I told Megan about him and said they and I will not become a couple because I am pursuing this guy. Megan was understandably hurt, as they seemed to think we were much more serious about becoming a couple than I was. They felt led on, I felt guilty. We discussed it at length, things settled down.

April comes. I told Megan that I was coming to paint in a week, and to make sure the walls were accessible. The entire foyer and living room are coated wall-to-wall in junk. I had to stack it all in the center of the room on shelving units, floor to ceiling. Whatever. Megan has just totaled their car and was dealing with their mom moving, so they were extremely overwhelmed. I ask that they make sure it's cleaned up by the time I move in.

May, my mom goes up, and no change in the mess. I ask Megan to please clean their stuff up. There's an entire attic and a basement they can store things in. Megan gives excuses about how the basement is too damp, the attic is too hot, all that. I offered to buy a dehumidifier for the basement, they ignored that. Later, they texted my mom about it, and my mom sided with me. Megan tells me a couple days later that they moved 90% of it to the attic, I said great, thank you.

June comes, moving time! Megan still has a bunch of stuff in the living room. At this point, I don't wanna be an ass, so I ask them if I can move it out of the way to the dining room so the movers can access everything. They say sure, I move it all.

It's now been over a month, and after repeatedly asking them to please clean up their pile so I can also get to unpacking that area, they haven't done anything. On top of that, they're extremely messy and I'm getting really tired of it. Our cats also don't get along, and one of their cats injured mine and now he's all anxious around them. We're gonna try reintroducing them.

165,1ekaexd,AITA for refusing to give my cat to my cousin?,"I (19M) have a cousin (21F). We lived in the same house until I was 8, and had a cat that was equally ours. However, my cousin moved to a different country, and the cat ended up staying with me, which my cousin was very upset over. The cat is (12F) now and I look after her very well.

My cousin still loves my cat, and is always affectionate to her whenever she comes back to visit. However, she still has her own pets back home.

I am moving to my own place very soon, and cannot take my cat with me. However, one of my friends is willing to take the cat, and I am sure he will take her of her well as he has experience with pets.

I mentioned this to my cousin when we were on a call, but she was very distraught about it. She asked if I could keep that cat with a relative until she could come back to visit again, so that she could take my cat instead.

I refused. I already promised to give it to my friend, and I don’t want to home the cat for another few months waiting for her to visit. She argued that it was her cat when she still lived with me and she should get first priority on it, but when I still said no, she ended the call and gave me the silent treatment. It has literally been a week and she is still not talking to me over it, which is very uncharacteristic of her because she does not hold grudges.

My grandmother was originally on my side, but after seeing how upset it made my cousin, offered to take care of the cat until my cousin could come back home. However, I already promised my friend that he could have my cat when I moved out, and I don't want to go back on my word.

Some of my family thinks my cousin is overreacting and I am in the right, but a few of them think I should just give my grandmother the cat so that I don’t have to take care of it and my cousin can have it.

I am moving to my own place very soon, and cannot take my cat with me. However, one of my friends is willing to take the cat, and I am sure he will take her of her well as he has experience with pets.

I mentioned this to my cousin when we were on a call, but she was very distraught about it. She asked if I could keep that cat with a relative until she could come back to visit again, so that she could take my cat instead.

I refused. I already promised to give it to my friend, and I don’t want to home the cat for another few months waiting for her to visit. She argued that it was her cat when she still lived with me and she should get first priority on it, but when I still said no, she ended the call and gave me the silent treatment. It has literally been a week and she is still not talking to me over it, which is very uncharacteristic of her because she does not hold grudges.

My grandmother was originally on my side, but after seeing how upset it made my cousin, offered to take care of the cat until my cousin could come back home. However, I already promised my friend that he could have my cat when I moved out, and I don't want to go back on my word.

Some of my family thinks my cousin is overreacting and I am in the right, but a few of them think I should just give my grandmother the cat so that I don’t have to take care of it and my cousin can have it. The split of perspectives has made me legitimately question whether I should just break the promise to my friend and if I was the asshole for refusing to give the cat to my cousin.",1.0,0.03506145998835564,0,0
