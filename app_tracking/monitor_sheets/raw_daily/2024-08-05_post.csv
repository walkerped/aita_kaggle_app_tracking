0,1ekqvg4,AITA for telling my brother to get out and taking his bitch of a wife when he asked for some of our mom’s ashes,"My mom used to live near my brother, she was a quiet person in general and after dad died was lonely. She wanted to have dinner with my brother and his family often. His wife ( cara) didn’t like that and they agreed to do it once a month. 

Mom started to have issue and would send panicked texts and went to the doctors randomly. Around this time his wife made a lot of post about how she was  an attention seeker and was making up problems. That she was trying to cause a wedge in their relationship. My brother stopped visiting our mother. It was everywhere and I do not like Cara at all.

When this started happening I decided to visit my mom( live in another state). It took me a day to realize something was wrong. Took her to the doctors and she had dementia.  I informed the family and became the main caretaker. Cara continue to make post or comments that she is faking it. My brother stood by her the whole time. 

I literally begged him to come visit before she passed on. She was cremated and I have the ashes. He didn’t even come to the viewing. 

This is the issue, he and Cara showed up asking for some of our moms ashes. I told him no, that he didn’t even see her before she died. This started an argument against the two. 

By the end of it I told him to get out and take his bitch of his wife with him. He has been calling me a jerk and telling me I have to apologize. The family is torn, some are saying fuck him and Cara bit other are saying I would give in because it’s his mom also ",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-08-05,"AITA for telling my brother to get out and taking his bitch of a wife when he asked for some of our mom’s ashes My mom used to live near my brother, she was a quiet person in general and after dad died was lonely.

2,1eka101,AITAH: Covid Friends go to Music Festival,"Hi all, I went to my first music festival this weekend. Was excited, but my close friend tested postive for COVID the night before. They're at the festival not wearing a mask, and the head's up was ""hey funny thing I have COVID"" to the rest of the group chat prior to the festival. I was shocked the friend went, and was equally suprised others in the group were ok. I have plans that COVID would derail, and thus tried to avoid them all this weekend, ending up sitting alone for a majority of a festival I spent $400ish dollars on. 

Note, this friend also thought I could drive them to this festival when they had COVID.  Appreciate their honesty in admitting to the infection, but given their overzealous defense against COVID during the pandemic, I think it's ironic that I have to be the leper.


The whole event has just been awkward. Insanely hot outside, the event seems like it was poorly organized, and would terrorize those with any hint of claursterphohia. He and everything else has soured my experience.

The biggest question, am I the asshole in being upset and dissappointed with my friends? Some insisted that it would be fine, others thought that if they get the virus, then oh well. I'm worried about me being a loner which maybe offended the group, and that its best I move on from all of this. This festival, them as people, I dont really know.

3,1ek9vwh,AITA for not cleaning up after my dad,"AITA for not cleaning up after my dad?

For some context, I live with my dad and younger brother. Our parents aren’t divorced but live in different cities for their jobs so our mom comes to visit on the weekends. My dad, brother, and sister have always been slobs leaving messes wherever they go.

Recently my parents went camping and my dad was preparing stuff in the kitchen and left a huge mess, with stains on the counters, crumbs, and unwashed dishes. They came home and my mom got mad at me for not cleaning up the kitchen while they were gone. I told her it wasn’t my mess so I’m not responsible for cleaning it, I’ve always believed this because as a kid I hated always cleaning up for other people’s mess. She got mad and was saying it’s your dads mess so you should clean it up, to which I responded and said if that were true why doesn’t my brother have to clean up after anyone then. She got mad saying she always cleans up after the family so I should clean too. I always clean up after myself and make sure it was cleaner than it was before. Even when I do help her clean she always complains that no one helps her clean, but she doesn’t do anything to make my dad or brother clean. The only times they do clean is if she gets mad at them and starts yelling, but they never do a satisfying job, leaving things sticky and still a mess.

During the week when my mom isn’t there I’m the only one cleaning and doing chores (taking out trash/recycle, sweeping, etc.) She always tells me to have my brother help me but when I tell him he doesn’t listen and just plays games. I do all these chores while also having to study for an exam to get my license as an RN. 

With that after I get a job my mom is also expecting me to pay the bills for the house my dad, brother, and I live in since I’ll be making more than him. And it’s just like if I’m doing all the chores and paying for the house how is that fair. I understand and appreciate that they’ve raised me and helped pay for my life expenses but it’s just unfair that I have to do everything while my siblings and dad get to be lazy and messy cause they’re always like that.

If I could I would move out but my mom expects me to help my parents pay bills and their debt. I also have school loans that I have to payback and I want to pay off my credit card but if I have to help them with all these things. My mom always tells me it’s more worth it to stay at home cause it’s cheaper than renting. Even though RNs get paid decently in my state my mom makes double what I would be making. 

I feel like because my mom has always seen me as being more responsible than my siblings so she expects a lot more from me. Which I don’t see as fair. She called me selfish and self-centered for not cleaning up after my dad because it’s not some random person I’m cleaning up after it’s my dad.

Right after I found out about this opportunity she reached out to an energy company through her brother and got an in to meet with an high level guy. He basically said he would create a job for her but that would require her to be out of state 3 weeks a month… which also means I can’t do my current job in sales that requires a night or two away from home a week. (9yo at the house) so for her to pursue this I need to quit and find part time work… if she stayed at her job I could pursue the out of state work. I understand this energy job could be huge career wise for her so I have been nothing but supportive… but after encouraging her to find something new for over a year I feel like she’s being selfish by taking on this new roll… and it’s a maybe vs my guaranteed job with almost triple pay for me.
