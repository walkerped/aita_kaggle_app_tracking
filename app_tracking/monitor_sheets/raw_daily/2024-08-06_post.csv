0,1elx9uy,AITA for telling my husband we can get a new babysitter if he finds a better one for the same price ,"My husband and I have 3 kids (10, 8, 5). We’ve had the same babysitter, Amelia (20) for almost 5 years. Amelia has filled a few different roles for us. She was our date night sitter, then during the pandemic she was our nanny, went back to date nights, and now she gets to our house at 7:15 every morning, gets the kids out the door, drops them off at school or camp, then twice a week she babysits at night so we can run errands or get some time to ourselves. 

Amelia’s “sweet spot” was 2022-2023. She had her car and license, had games and activities planned for everyone, was always on time and prepared, and was generally more available and focused. She’s still good now but doesn’t always come with crafts and activities, can be 5-10 minutes late, and more often than not orders DoorDash for herself to our house. It’s all manageable and she still knows and loves our kids and she’s very affordable. 

The final straw for my husband was when Amelia told us that she had recently been diagnosed with autism and that she thinks our 8 year old should get an assessment, as they are exactly alike. I never would’ve known Amelia is autistic but I’m definitely willing to get an assessment. My husband saw it as rude and thinks she shouldn’t have brought it up unless we asked. 

He thinks it’s time to get a new sitter so I told him we can get a new sitter if he can find someone just as good as Amelia for the same rate as her. He says we can afford better than Amelia so we can spend more and get someone that will be focused on their work like Amelia used to be before she started college and got another job. 

I know we can afford more but I still want to stick with Amelia.

1,1elw7f5,"AITA for making my dad ""put my needs before my sister's""","I'm 18 and my sister is 20. We are complete opposites - I'm outgoing and positive, while she's more cynical and introverted. Despite that, we're pretty close. However, our relationship is strained. I have a lot of health issues, which has led to my parents being extra attentive and supportive towards me, which has caused resentment from my sister at times.

My sister is fun to be around but can be quick to anger. She's into fitness and often has bruises but refuses to take painkillers because they interfere with some (very optional) supplement she takes.

Every year we go to Comic Con. I am a very big reader, so before the con started, I told my father the thing I wanted to do the absolute most was meet my favorite author and get her books signed. This was happening later on Sunday.

We get to the signing on Sunday, but end up near the back of the line. Halfway through the line, my sister comes up to us and says she is done. She had been telling us the last couple of days that her shoulder had been hurting, but again, refused to do anything about it. We told her to go sit at one of the tables on the other side of the pavilion where the signing was being held. A bit later, she texted my dad that she went to the CAR and can he please come unlock it. But they won't let people back in line once they leave, and tells me he doesn't want to miss it (I'd been telling him how much I wanted to meet this author for many months) and asks her to just wait or come back and sit at the tables as he told her to. About 45 minutes later we're done (it was amazing, but it did run about 30 minutes over) and we rush back to the car. We all get in and drive home. We ask if she's okay, and she grumbles that she's fine. She does not take any pain meds or do anything else to feel better.

The next day or two, she proceeds to ignore me whenever I talk to her. I just kind of roll my eyes and say whatever until she starts talking to me again (she does this relatively often). A few days later, all is back to normal and we're fine (or so I think.)

A week later my dad asked me to text her from his phone (mine was not working). I did, but then I saw the texts above. After we got home on Sunday, she had sent a freaking barrage of texts calling him a terrible dad and yelling at him for always putting my needs before hers.

This made my blood boil. I don't get why she complains about all this pain but proceeds to be completely fine once we get home, and refuses to do anything about it. Also, I stay hours and hours later than I would like at the con for her every year, but she can't manage one hour longer ONE time so I can do the event I wanted to do more than anything?? I stayed until 10 two days prior when I had wanted to leave at 5 so she could do her most anticipated panel. On Sunday, she was done at 4 and we were done at 5.

3,1elvs61,AITA for telling a woman she shouldn't be a mother,"So I (F29) was out walking my dog last night close to where my grandma lives - so not an area I'm really a local in but still in the same town. I turned onto a street and there was a little boy standing in the middle of the path in a t-shirt and nappy. He didn't have any shoes on, looked a little grubby but wasn't crying or anything. He lit up when he spotted my dog and just kept pointing at her and saying 'doggy'. She's small and friendly so I let him pet her for a while before I went to continue with my walk. He began following me, giggling and trying to keep pace with my dog. I obviously didn't want to let him stray too far away from his house but I had no idea where he lived. None of the houses had their doors open, no people in the gardens or windows. There wasn't even a house with toys in the front to indicate children. I crouched down and asked him which house was his but he either wasn't old enough to understand or was simply more interested in the dog. I was debating what to do - start going door to door or phone the police - when a woman came tearing out of one of the houses halfway down the street, shouting the little boys name. I stood up to tell her I'd found him at the end of the street when she turned on ME, demanding to know who I thought I was, what kind of person I was trying to lead her child away. I was floored. I genuinely laughed, thinking she must be joking but she grabbed him and told me to stay away from children that don't belong to me. I think I saw red because I remember telling her that if a child that young can get out of the house and down the street without her realising it, she doesn't deserve to be a mother. He could have walked in front of a car or met someone who actually intended harm! She started swearing and shouting and I had to walk away because it was genuinely just wild. All I can think about now is, what if something happens to that kid, or what if the next person to try and help him is a guy that gets accused of something he wasn't intending to do, all because she can't keep an eye on her kid?

I don't really agree with shaming women on their parenting skills and I do feel a little bad for saying it but I felt like it was the least she deserved at the time.

Edit - adding this in to clarify because someone is accusing me of leaving the kid alone. I got two steps with the dog and the kid following me before I realised I had no clue where the kid had come from, how far he was from home, and I didn't want to lead him further. I crouched down, asked where he lived, when he never answered, I was deciding to either knock on some doors or call the police when the mother appeared. I didn't leave him. I didn't walk away. The situation all happened within the space of about 2 minutes. 

UPDATE 

Just wanted to thank everyone for their responses. After sitting with it and hearing a lot of different people give their perspective, I can admit I reacted out of anger at being accused of something I hadn’t done. I don’t agree with shaming parents, and especially mothers, unless I know the whole circumstance. I’ve also learned how masterful toddlers are at escaping and sneaking off without being immediately noticed!

I did call the non-emergency number who took my details and had someone from CPS call me back. I went over everything that happened and provided the street address, and when I wasn’t able to recall the door number, they asked me if the house was coloured a specific colour, which it was. Since it stood out and none of the houses around it were remotely the same colour, I’m going to guess the household is known to them, but obviously I didn’t ask for details I wasn’t going to get.

4,1elvqvx,AITAH for not giving up inheritance?,"Hello.

My estranged mum died a few years back and her estate is finally being distributed. There isn’t a will, so it should be split equally between me and my half brother, her only kids. However, my brother (who she wasn’t estranged from) has told me that he thinks she’d have wanted it all to go to him, and I can waive my half if I want. 

My relationship with my brother only really took off about 6 months after she died, as we didn’t meet until after the funeral. I’m conscious that not agreeing to the request could put that relationship in jeopardy (but a cynical side of me also wonders if he only built the relationship with me to then ask me to do this). 

I also have my own kids to think about - my own sons are in school and if I were to put the money aside for them, it could be of great use to them when they’re adults.

5,1elvmfs,AITA for calling out  my sister for giving away yoga classes I paid for. ,"
My mom, sister, and I decided to sign up for a yoga class together. I paid for everyone, and no one paid me back. It wasn’t a big deal. My sister agreed to pay me but kept forgetting, and my mom is cash-strapped, so I didn’t even ask her.

We liked the yoga classes so much that we signed up for a second session. Again, I paid, and no one reimbursed me despite my casual mentions. It still wasn't a big deal to me.

Thirty minutes before the second session started, my sister called to say my mom had injured her leg and couldn't attend. My sister gave my mom’s spot to her friend for free. These classes are not cheap. I didn’t mind paying for family as it’s good bonding time, but paying for a random person bothered me.

I was annoyed that my mom didn’t inform me about her injury despite talking to her that weekend. I could have tried to get a refund. Instead, my sister gave away the spot for free to her friend.

I told my sister and mom that I didn’t like how they handled this. My sister blew up and finally paid me back for the class.

I’m over it now, but my sister thinks I was petty for calling her out.

7,1elvayz,AITA for last-minute cancelling on driving my coworker to our boss’s retirement party?,"I’m 19, I’m a college student and work as a barista. I’ve been at this job for almost 2 years, and my store manager is retiring. Yesterday was her last day and she threw a party for the whole team at a restaurant in the same shopping center as our store.



The people who were working that day just walked over after work but those who weren’t working that day drove to the restaurant. It’s about a 5 minute drive for me.



I have a coworker, Elise, who lives in my neighborhood and doesn’t have a car. I work opening shifts and Elise closes, so typically our schedules don’t line up, but on the rare occasion we start work around the same time I always would drive her. 



So about 2 weeks before the party she asked if I could drive her to and from the party and I said of course. 



The day of, I texted her about 20 minutes before the party was set to start and told her I was about to head out to pick her up. 



She responded: “Okay! Here’s my new address:” and then sent an address 15 minutes away in the opposite direction.



I was so confused and was like “you moved?” and she explained to me that she’d moved earlier in the week which was why she wasn’t on the schedule that week (I hadn’t really noticed).



I told her that I couldn’t drive her, at this point it would make me late plus I was low on gas and would have to make a stop for more gas if I was driving that far. She kept saying it was only 15 minutes, and when I told her it was actually at least 30 minutes because I’d have to drive to her and then back with her. And then another 30 minutes on the way home. So literally an hour of driving total when I’d been planning on driving 10 minutes total.



She was really upset and kept calling me but I declined her calls and let her know I couldn’t drive her. I told her if she’d told me about the move upfront I would have considered going to pick her up, but she let me believe she was right down the road until the last second.



Elise ended up missing the party and sent me a crying voicemail because she loved our store manager (we all did- she’s an awesome woman) and had to miss out on seeing her for the last time, which I do feel bad about.



My friend (who also works there) is telling me I’m the asshole bc I had agreed to drive her after all and I should have checked beforehand. And some other coworkers are agreeing. But Elise never talked about moving, so I feel like it was reasonable for me to assume she still lived in the same place. AITA?

",Not the A-hole,2024-08-06,"AITA for last-minute cancelling on driving my coworker to our boss’s retirement party? I’m 19, I’m a college student and work as a barista. I’ve been at this job for almost 2 years, and my store manager is retiring. Yesterday was her last day and she threw a party for the whole team at a restaurant in the same shopping center as our store.



The people who were working that day just walked over after work but those who weren’t working that day drove to the restaurant. It’s about a 5 minute drive for me.



I have a coworker, Elise, who lives in my neighborhood and doesn’t have a car. I work opening shifts and Elise closes, so typically our schedules don’t line up, but on the rare occasion we start work around the same time I always would drive her. 



So about 2 weeks before the party she asked if I could drive her to and from the party and I said of course. 



The day of, I texted her about 20 minutes before the party was set to start and told her I was about to head out to pick her up. 



She responded: “Okay! Here’s my new address:” and then sent an address 15 minutes away in the opposite direction.



I was so confused and was like “you moved?” and she explained to me that she’d moved earlier in the week which was why she wasn’t on the schedule that week (I hadn’t really noticed).



I told her that I couldn’t drive her, at this point it would make me late plus I was low on gas and would have to make a stop for more gas if I was driving that far. She kept saying it was only 15 minutes, and when I told her it was actually at least 30 minutes because I’d have to drive to her and then back with her. And then another 30 minutes on the way home.

8,1elv9rz,AITA for telling my friend about her pos boyfriend ,"Okay so I’m not sure if anyone’s going to see this but. My (22-year-old female) boyfriend (24-year-old male) has a friend (26-year-old male) and his girlfriend (20-year-old female) who we’ll call Jim and Shirley. For some context, I moved with my boyfriend to his hometown about 3 years ago and I met Jim's girlfriend Shirley for the first time. When they first started talking, she wasn’t really interested in him. They stayed together and ended up having a baby together and got a home together. Well, one night before they moved to their new home, we all had a moving party, with drinks and green. Jim gets a little too friendly with me. As I’m dancing and having fun, I start twerking on Shirley. Now, I didn’t see this. He turned around and said, “oh 
this is what we’re doing now huh” and motioned his d to my face. All of this came up when another night we were hanging out at their new place with some drinks, and Jim pulls out his 🔫 and starts to point it at his head. Shirley ended up having enough of it and her and her baby stayed the night with me. When we were getting the baby in the car, he’s literally telling this 1-year-old he wants to 🔫 himself. A while later, Shirley posted me on her story with my mention, and he added me. At first, everything was okay. I have stage 3 endometriosis, and this said day I was having a bad flare-up. I sent out streaks saying, “I feel 80” and he replied with, “does sex make it worse?” I said, “yes, my boyfriend has sent me to the hospital a couple of times over it.” He replied back with, “how lucky, that could never be me.” The conversation ended up taking a turn into something worse. Back a long time ago, I was going to hook up with Jim. This was back in 2019 or 2018. He added me on snap and the first thing I got from him when I added him back was a d pic. Instantly got the ick. He started talking about that day and how he was glad he didn’t come down because he would’ve fallen in love with me. I ended up having enough of this because it was so disrespectful to my boyfriend. Jim would never message me when he was home. Only when he went to work. Jim goes to work at 5 am, that’s the only time I would hear from him. If he was home, I’d be left on delivered or left on read, but if this man was at work he was in my notes 20 times. My boyfriend saw all of this happening in real-time. I dropped streaks with him on a Saturday and he’s usually off on the weekends. Monday morning he snaps me and I leave him on read. Well, he messages me again about our streak so I remove him because at this point I’m getting so angry. I end up telling Shirley everything that’s been said the last couple of days, and now I’m the asshole for even keeping the conversation going in the first place. I feel like I should’ve gotten more proof but he’s done some other things, like text his buddy, “daddy almost messed up with the vagina tattooed girl.” She ended up making me the bad person and removing me on everything.

I (14m) have an older brother (15m) who I share a room with and have shared a room with as far as I can remember. He met this guy a while back who I think is now either his best friend or a situationship type thing?? I don’t know, we’ll call him C. So he calls C all the time, but only really at night cause he hates when our family interrupts the call cause we’re kind of dysfunctional and all whatever whatever. At first the calls didn’t bother me but lately they’ve been going on for longer and longer which has started interrupting my sleep since I can’t get relaxed easily with people talking so loudly. Last night he had the lights on in our room until like 2:30-3:00 o’ clock in the morning and ended the call at anywhere from 6 to 7. That woke me up multiple times and I only got about 3 hours of sleep in which made me really pissed off when I woke up. Eventually our mom noticed and asked if I was okay to which I told her about the night in a very VERY sarcastic tone, completely unserious and relatively unbothered by then since I’d managed to get some hours in after I initially woke up. She ended up a little shocked and I thought it was all fine until I was getting my clothes ready for my shower and my brother came in the room all like “you did not have to tell her that” and “you’re literally fine” and stuff like that. I was confused and actually a little irritated but I tried to brush it off until he mentioned that he doesn’t tell her about an old addiction of mine. I felt like it was a little wrong for him to compare the two so casually but regardless it genuinely upset me a lot and I ended up crying in front of my mom which hasn’t happened in a really long time. I’m really confused about it since I’m a little slow to realize if I’m in the wrong or not and I’m also just a generally sensitive person so I have no idea whether I’m overreacting or not and whether I should’ve just kept my mouth shut or not. I have no clue if I have the right to feel victimized/disrespected here or not and I’d just like some clarification from some other opinions and perspectives.

And for the record, there are two things to take into consideration. 1, I was mostly over said addiction before this all went down. I hadn’t been taking part in it in a little under a year. 2, my brother could very likely have BPD, but at the moment, we’re unable to get any sort of diagnosis for anything, mainly due to money and (I think) his age, so I can’t confirm anything about that.

13,1elunmk,AITA for not getting items on a baby shower gift list?,"So my brother and his wife are having their first child together (although it is important to know this will be my brothers second). They announced they were having a baby shower this upcoming Saturday since most of us could make it.

With the baby shower date set, we also got a list of items from his wife. The cheapest item is well over $100 and that seems unreasonable to me; she is also insisting that everybody only get items on the list: examples include a standing bath and change table, a wall mounted change table, several styles of baby carriers, spacious stroller, a specific diaper bag, several humidifiers, several diffusers, the list goes on.

My brother has been telling us to talk to her about the baby items, so when I approached her about it and the costs, she said they didn't need help affording the cheaper things like baby clothing, diapers, wipes, formula (if she needed it) and what not. They needed help with the more expensive items on the list, but after work I spoke to my brother about it again and he admitted even he was frustrated; it is behavior he has never seen from her.

When I asked him what he wanted, he repeated 'diapers and wipes' a handful of times; I discussed my financial situation with him and told him I simply couldn't afford her wish list of baby items. Let's just say my siblings and I are stable but struggling on a month-to-month basis.

My brother did reveal that one of his own purchases he had to make was a portable playpen with a soft mattress on the bottom, while also having a bassinet and change station insert that clipped onto the frame and sat inside the playpen itself.

My sisters and I all chipped in together and got him the playpen he wanted, which wasn't cheap (for us) and not on the list. We also let him know we got him the playpen (playard?). He's very thankful, warned us that his wife might be 'more than a little ticked at you guys' this Saturday, but did say he'd deal with it when we crossed that bridge.

My sisters and I ended up contributing around $50/each or so, though I personally paid around $80. For the lot of us it is far less than the expected $100+ his wife wanted and not even an item on the 'baby needs' list.

So yeah... are we the assholes for not getting an item on her list? Am I the asshole for going around her back and getting something my brother couldn't yet afford but wanted? AITA for not contributing $100+ to our still unborn niece?

The group had about 12 people but Ed (M38) and Scott (M37) were my closest friends within the group, and they even organised my stag do (bachelor party). Steve (M37), while not as close to me, would always come to my parties (and vice-versa) and was someone I really liked.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, things got a bit tense in the group as not everyone was following the rules and I was quite vocal about it. I even discovered that Steve and his boyfriend had a barbecue in his house when gatherings were not allowed, and once I made a joke about him not following the rules, but he denied it. But other people also seemed a bit bothered about my opinions. 

When COVID restrictions eased I hosted a birthday party outdoors and no one from the group showed up, while only Ed told me that he couldn't make it as he had to isolate - the others didn't bother to tell me they were not coming.

After the vaccine rollout, when people were back to their normal lives, Ed sent me the following text (word for word): 

""See, me, Scott and Steve are going to Madrid 4-7 August. If you want to come too 😂 we are going to Barcelona before"". 

They had their flights and the whole trip already planned and booked so it the late ""invitation"" felt odd and insincere. Plus, my brother lives in Madrid, so they knew I'm always up for going there as I don't need to pay for a place to stay. I felt I was an afterthought - and I wondered ""why invite me at all?"".

A week later, one of my best friends, Matt (M35), who also lives in Madrid (and whom I had introduced to Ed and Scott) contacted me to say they had asked to stay at his spare room rent-free. After explaining the situation, I asked him to decline their request (and he agreed).

While they ultimately didn't stay there, Matt met with them for drinks and took the opportunity to ask them why I didn't go to Madrid as well. They convoluted a story about me not being able to agree to the trip in time, and said that I already had another trip booked to Florida. Turns out I only booked that trip AFTER I wasn't invited to Madrid, as a way of rubbing in their faces that I could have a better holiday with friends from back home (I'm a gemini so I do enjoy little vendettas).

I think I would have been fine if I wasn't invited at all, but I felt very used after they lied to my friend, as it seemed to confirm my suspicions that I was only told because they wanted to stay at Matt's.

15,1elujpe,AITA for wanting my BF to keep his promise about keeping a cat ,"Hello Reddit, I recently found podcast about Reddit (SRRS) and while I listened to all the episodes, I found myself thinking about this situation.

Me (23) and my BF of one year moved in together to my family home. We were planning to do a big reconstruction within 6–9 months, and our tenants just moved out, it would not make sense to look for new ones also I'm still at college So we needed to save  money. I have a small dog (14) And He recently Lost a cat. We knew that we couldn't have a new pet: we would move to a small flat and I have an older dog. And it is difficult to find a place with a pet - owners usually choose people without pets. And having one pet already puts us at a disadvantage. 
Mother of BF finds a cat and decides to keep him. They already have two cats and they do not get along- he attacks them. So she asks if we could keep him till they find him a new home. So I said yes - we have a free room he can have all for himself. we did have a talk, and he promised we wouldn't keep him.  House has 2 floors. 3 rooms and a bathroom upstairs. And a kitchen and a walkthrough living room downstairs. + two big corridors. We lived downstairs; part of the living room was our bedroom, and we used the bathroom upstairs. My dog was with us downstairs. First, Cat got his own room upstairs. Then he could use every room, also the downstairs corridor, so dog couldn't go there anymore- cat would attack him. Later, BF started to let him in the kitchen which meant he could go everywhere. Dog was scared of him after he attacked him multiple times (for cat reasons). So I expressed my concerns about his health because he's old and I don't want him stressed all the time. So he would let him there only if he was in the room, and that he would keep him out of the living room so the dog can have at least one space for himself only. He comes to me one day that He thinks about keeping him. I reminded him of the reasons + that He promised), and we didn't talk about it anymore till the talk about finding a new place started 5 months later. I found us a great place for a good price from a family friend who, also has a no-pet policy. He knew the dog and said it would be ok since he's old, but no cat. BF said absolutely not, that he couldn't put him away and that where would he go? I explained again that I'm not comfortable with a dog sharing a room with a cat since he attacks him. And we can't afford more rooms for both pets to have their own, even if they would let us rent with 2 pets. Which escalated into a huge fight. He said that i'm selfish and when i reminded him about his promise He said that things change and that i'm not adaptable And either him and Cat or we have to broke up.

I do love Cat and would love to keep him so i do sometimes think about if it was an Ahole thing to do, because I understand the love for a pet. But I did it because of the love I have for my dog.

16,1elu79j,AITA for not raising my two younger half sisters,"Throwaway account.

I (18f) am living with my relatives and two half younger sisters, 1 year old and 8 years old. I moved out of my dads about a year and a half ago due to reasons and now I'm being expected to become one of their adoptive parents. Both their parents and one of my parents died so they're in the process of adopting them and want to include my name too. I have mixed feelings about taking care of them, but the vast majority of the time I don't want to. I feel that if I say yes now I'll forever regret it later on and miss out and doing things I want to do.

In the past, I've gone through periods of having no communication with the relatives that are adopting them. There's an expectation that once I complete my degree and find a job I'll be helping out both financially and practically in raising them. They've said things such as, ""We put our whole lives on hold to take care of them,"" and in my mind I'm thinking that's great and all, but my life is just hardly beginning and I don't want to be chained down so early on. Every day I wake up I feel trapped and a sort of hopelessness. I feel immensely uncomfortable every time they bring up me taking care of them. My relatives have been good to me for the time I've lived with them but as I said before, it's not like they've had a huge influence and presence in my life through every step so far.

I have dreams of moving out of the city I've lived in my whole life, moving on to do what I want to do, enjoy my peace and time that I feel I desperately deserved after all I've been through. Don't get me wrong, I love my family, but I don't want to be forced or obligated to take care of two dependents who I didn't bring into the world and who are not my responsibility, especially until the little one turns 18.

TLDR: My family expects me to raise my two younger half sisters even though I never explictly agreed to it. I don't want to because I'm young and I want to live my own life. AITA?

Once the film ended, we started chatting about how annoying and bad the characters were, relating it to our own experiences.

The rest of us disagreed with her but we moved the conversation on regardless after some argument.

22,1eltjtl,AITA for yelling at my aunt to stop rubbing lotions on me.,"So I was on a trip with my dad down to the south and I'm from the north so I got horribly sun burnt and needed sunscreen so my aunt gave me sunscreen like spray ones and then she started rubbing it and I thought that was weird cause I thought you don't rub that type of sunscreen.

Then she started offering more types of sunscreen and then lotion and wouldn't stop rubbing it on my arms and then her mom started offering it and I was a little annoyed but let them just to be nice.

Then we went to Pensacola Florida and I got a worse sunburn and water blisters to the point I was crying and she kept rubbing stuff on my arms and back and they did this for 3 days until I felt like a stone statue and I got fed up and yelled at her and her mom and told them to stop rubbing stuff on my arms cause it hurt like hell and that I could barely even put a shirt on and that I felt a little bit weird having them rubbing me all the time.

AITA for this?

Edit:
People are pointing out how I could have done it myself and multiple times I insisted on doing it myself but they wouldn't listen that's one reason I yelled.

So I was on a trip with my dad down to the south and I'm from the north so I got horribly sun burnt and needed sunscreen so my aunt gave me sunscreen like spray ones and then she started rubbing it and I thought that was weird cause I thought you don't rub that type of sunscreen.

Then she started offering more types of sunscreen and then lotion and wouldn't stop rubbing it on my arms and then her mom started offering it and I was a little annoyed but let them just to be nice.

Then we went to Pensacola Florida and I got a worse sunburn and water blisters to the point I was crying and she kept rubbing stuff on my arms and back and they did this for 3 days until I felt like a stone statue and I got fed up and yelled at her and her mom and told them to stop rubbing stuff on my arms cause it hurt like hell and that I could barely even put a shirt on and that I felt a little bit weird having them rubbing me all the time.

AITA for this?

Edit:
People are pointing out how I could have done it myself and multiple times I insisted on doing it myself but they wouldn't listen that's one reason I yelled.

My Aunt is my Dad's sister. For my whole life, I have lived with my parents and my Dad's parents. This meant that when they split, a lot of negative feelings developed towards my Uncle.

My bf gave Sydney, her friend (Kyle)’s girlfriend (Julia), and I a ride there. Kyle and Julia are the only friends my bf and I have met before, and we really like them. The rest have been very close for years and Sydney recently started hooking with one of them (Liam). I'm sorry in advance for the number of names in this story!

The first morning, Liam is making “jokes” at my expense. For example, saying “who asked” after I talk. (We’re not teenagers btw.) I have thick skin and I don’t mind playful roasting or teasing with my friends but since we haven't even had a real conversation before this, I just found it a bit strange. The jokes continued and Liam made no effort to get to know my bf or myself or include us in any conversation with his best friends. 

I tried not to let it get to me, since we just met and because Sydney is hooking up with him. Eventually, I kind of gave up trying to talk to Liam and his friends. I had fun with Sydney and my bf the rest of the day. 

Later that night, everyone was away doing something else and I was feeling anxious. Sydney came up to talk to me and I told her I just needed some alone time. She started telling me a bunch of things the group (excluding Kyle and his gf Julia) were saying about me like, I’m ""not as laid back as everyone"" and how I was acting ""bossy"", etc etc. (Idk if this is relevant but I have diagnosed OCD, which she knows about, so I'm thinking maybe they perceived some of my traits to be weird or uptight, I have no idea.) At this point, this just adds onto the anxiety and I start having an anxiety attack.

She leaves, I calm down a bit and I ask my bf to straight up tell me if there was any truth to what she said. He literally has no idea what she was talking about and we tried to think of reasons because I didn’t ask anyone to do anything that entire day. The only thing I can think of is asking Sydney if she could help me carry lawn chairs. She gave me no concrete examples.

Sydney comes back and I tell her I'm uncomfortable. I bring up how anxious I’ve been because my bf and I keep trying to be nice to the group, and Liam seems to keep avoiding us or be rude to me. She says “he’s just nervous” and wants my approval for her. This isn’t the first time she hooks up with guys who are rude to me for no reason. She leaves again and I’m in tears. My bf asked Kyle if we could talk and we basically told him thanks for planning the trip, and for being welcoming.

I ran this by another friend who is also friends with Cindy and her husband and though she completely understood the reasoning she thinks it would break both their hearts and definitely end the friendship. WIBTA if I just invited them so late they couldn't arrange travel? I do feel bad but also dred spending my fiancée and I's special day catering to someone else.",1.0,0.9501651,1,1

My (m33) gf (f37) tried to surprise me one morning with coffee and breakfast.
She had phoned me as I was driving down the road to the gym, so I pulled over and answered. 

She had asked what I was doing right now and I told her I was on my way to the gym, to which she said “don’t go I’m coming over with coffee!”. I told her that was so sweet and i love her for wanting to do that, but remember that I was meeting my friend (f33) at the gym this morning and already told her this, to which she said she forgot and she’d see me later like we had planned. Apparently she broke down crying over this after we hung up. 

Now some back story to that is I initially said no to going with my friend, as my former gfs husband had cheated on her with his gym “buddy” and I didn’t want that to be a concern that ever crossed her mind. She told me I was so sweet and she loved that I thought of her trauma, but she trusted me and it was fine I wanted to help a friend out. I made 100% sure she was fine with it beforehand. To be clear I also spent most of my free time with her and son, so it’s not like I was putting other people before her constantly. 

What came after that was months of a clearly dying relationship, all stemming from this moment. Zero intimacy, we ended up having the same heavy conversations again and again, she didn’t want me staying over, and she admitted she could never see me again as anything other than the guy who picked her second from that day on. 
She said that I gave this friend “boyfriend energy”, despite only seeing that friend  for a total of about 7 hours over the course of 5 months.

She talks about these problems everyday lbut recently I’ve been getting more irritated and completely blew up at her because she said I wouldn’t understand her because I have a close cousin here who I see once a month whereas all her friends at school are just normal friends not best friends.

We actually have pretty good seats and had planned to make the trip a girls weekend. As the concert date is approaching, we’re seeing tickets in our seating area (and worse seating areas) sell for large amounts, like over 1k.

If we sell the tickets, the 2 paid friends would get the full value of what they paid plus any extra money from the upsell.

38,1elqpdr,AITA for bringing up my GF’s jealousy issues? ,"
My GF has always struggled with jealousy. Not in a “other girls” way but in a day to day way. She gets very upset if I do or plan to do anything without her, saying she gets FOMO. I have worked with it in the past as it has always been worth it for her. However recently it has been bubbling up more since she has gotten busier. I have brought it up and we’ve had somewhat constructive discussions, but she has told me she is working on herself.

Today she told me that this Friday, when we would usually have our chill night to begin the weekend, that she will be at a family birthday in the afternoon and then she’s going to her friend’s house for the night. So, we will see each other Saturday. 

On Friday there is a local event taking place that I will be attending as a photographer. I figured since my GF and I won’t be meeting up I can stay as late as I need. My friend, also a photographer, text me to say he will be there and we can meet up. Great, I thought, I’ll have a friend to chat to. 

I brought this up with my GF and her first reaction was a disappointed “oh” 

Me: Is there a problem?

Gf: So you guys are hanging out?

Me: I guess so. I figured since you had your own plans it wouldn’t be an issue.

Gf: Plans can change though. I didn’t know you were gonna make others. 

Me: You said we wouldn’t see each other. Do you expect me to leave my schedule open in case your plans don’t work out? 

Gf: I might want to go to the event though.

Me: I didn’t say you couldn’t. If you can then great we can all hang out together. 

Gf: Ok.

Me: You shouldn’t be upset that I’ll be seeing a friend at this event when we agreed we wouldn’t be seeing each other until Saturday.
 
Gf: I have no indication that I was upset

Me: You did though. Your first reaction was “Oh”

Gf: You shouldn’t be bringing up my first reaction it doesn’t mean anything. 

Me: Well I think i should because it shows you are still jealous of me doing anything that doesn’t involve you. 

Gf: I can’t do anything can I. I told you I am trying my best to be fine with you doing things without me. This is me being fine. Either accept it or don’t. You are instigating another fight.

I left it at that because I didn’t want to cause an argument. But did I push it too far by bringing up the jealousy she’s been working on ( I feel she has a lot of work to do.) She has since told me shes upset with me for not giving her more patience, and that she’s cancelled her plans so that she can come to the event with me.

Conversations like this are not uncommon, something along these lines usually end up happening once a week or so. While yes she obviously has a problem with her jealousy and FOMO, I fear that after these conversations I always end up sparking an angry reaction out of her when I point it out. 

I would really appreciate any outside opinions and a verdict on whether or not I am the asshole in this situation

41,1elq2m3,AITA for leaving my baby with my partner so I can see my friend for the night?,"Idk if this’ll be long or not but here goes

I had a baby 6 weeks ago, it’s very full on. My partner works very long hours so I never expect him to do any nights feeds etc and this works for us, and I personally don’t struggle with the nights feeds per se. I am tired but not too much.

Anyway, I’ve been feeling quite low since baby was born and feeling like I’ve lost my identity, I don’t have any family or friends near me so I’m basically just stuck in the house with the baby constantly. On my partners days off we do things together or he will go and plan golf with a friend.

For the last 15 years I’ve gone down to London to see my best friend of all those years, it’s a weekend thing and we have a great time, she’s my only friend.

 I spoke with my partner early on about how I would like this to continue when baby comes (but obviously not as often as we used to do, it was once a month) my partner has always said ‘you’re a mom now, you can’t be going to London for 2 nights, you need to make mom friends’

This has broken me, but now the baby is here, it’s broken me even more, my best friend has severe anxiety and doesn’t drive, and tbf I like going to hers, so without that. I have nothing to do or no one to see other than making mom friends (which I don’t want) 

I mentioned it again to my partner today and tried to compromise and say ‘can I just go for one night’ he again says ‘no because you’re too immature when you’re with her and you need to make new friends here, you can’t go to hers and leave your baby here, you’re a mom now’

AITA for wanting to spend the night at my friends? I would maybe want to go, once every 3-4 months which is different to the once every month I did before. But this was a huge part of my life, she’s my best friend, without her, I’m no one but my son’s mom. 

How do I convince my partner to let me go? Or should I convince him at all? Am I wrong for going and leaving my baby at home? Should I just be more mature now and
make mom friends? 

A bit of context to back my partner up a bit, me and my friend have always been a tad immature, there’s a ten year age gap between me and my partner, he is 38, so he doesn’t get it, I am 28 so I am older and should be more mature but when I see her, we tend to have a little drink in the house, play games and maybe when we’re extremely drunk we have been known to prank call people (this is why my partner says I shouldn’t be going down anymore as moms do this)
I am aware how stupidly immature we are and I would obviously try and tone it down, but it was all just a little fun for me.

Please let me know your honest feelings, I don’t mind if I’m the one who’s wrong, I can take it  

Edit to add: baby is bottle fed

Another edit to add: I would not be wanting to go until baby is 6 months old ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-06,"AITA for leaving my baby with my partner so I can see my friend for the night? Idk if this’ll be long or not but here goes

I had a baby 6 weeks ago, it’s very full on. My partner works very long hours so I never expect him to do any nights feeds etc and this works for us, and I personally don’t struggle with the nights feeds per se. I am tired but not too much.

Anyway, I’ve been feeling quite low since baby was born and feeling like I’ve lost my identity, I don’t have any family or friends near me so I’m basically just stuck in the house with the baby constantly. On my partners days off we do things together or he will go and plan golf with a friend.

For the last 15 years I’ve gone down to London to see my best friend of all those years, it’s a weekend thing and we have a great time, she’s my only friend.

 I spoke with my partner early on about how I would like this to continue when baby comes (but obviously not as often as we used to do, it was once a month) my partner has always said ‘you’re a mom now, you can’t be going to London for 2 nights, you need to make mom friends’

This has broken me, but now the baby is here, it’s broken me even more, my best friend has severe anxiety and doesn’t drive, and tbf I like going to hers, so without that. I have nothing to do or no one to see other than making mom friends (which I don’t want) 

I mentioned it again to my partner today and tried to compromise and say ‘can I just go for one night’ he again says ‘no because you’re too immature when you’re with her and you need to make new friends here, you can’t go to hers and leave your baby here, you’re a mom now’

AITA for wanting to spend the night at my friends? I would maybe want to go, once every 3-4 months which is different to the once every month I did before. But this was a huge part of my life, she’s my best friend, without her, I’m no one but my son’s mom. 

How do I convince my partner to let me go? Or should I convince him at all? Am I wrong for going and leaving my baby at home? Should I just be more mature now and
make mom friends?

42,1elq06z,AITA for being a wingwoman?,"A couple months ago a boy in my class confided in me and told me that he had a crush on one of my close friends. This was a new experience for me and he told me not to tell her as he didn’t want it to be awkward so I kept my mouth shut. I was trying to help him come up with things to say to her and different ways he could let her know about his feelings. A few hours after he told me, I was texting my friend and i almost spilled the beans. I in turn said something like “Me and crush’s name were talking about that one guy you like”. For context she likes her crush’s friend and the crush doesn’t like that very much. So of course she wanted to know more but if I told her more she would know that the crush had feelings and I know she wouldn’t like that. But I also didn’t know because months earlier she stated how the crush had a glow up and she would date him. Even though she said this, I wasn’t too sure if she would be open to the idea of maybe giving him a shot. So rewind to the texting part. I’m texting both her and the crush at the same time. I’m telling her little details and I’m freaking out because she’s asking questions. In turn I send the crush her messages (i know i shouldn’t have done that but i panicked) and asked him what to say to her message. A few days later I ended up telling her that he liked her. She wasn’t angry at me but rather at him. They were friends and she didn’t want anything to ruin the friendship. She also felt awkward and at that moment I knew she didn’t have feelings. She then wanted to look through me and his messages but I forgot that pictures of her messages were exchanged between him and I. She saw them and got really upset with me. I tried talking to her yet she ignored me for days. I felt really bad but at the same time I wanted to open up and explain myself to her but she just shut me down. She would talk to others in my face and when I would try to communicate she ignored me which really hurt. It also wasn’t the first time she’s acted that way after I made a mistake but whatever.

43,1elpp19,AITA for Confronting My Family About My Brother Being Praised for the Bare Minimum?,"Throwaway account because my brother knows my main.

I (21F) am having a major issue with my family, especially my mom, over my brother (23M). To give some context, my brother and I have always been treated differently, but it's really started to bother me more as I've gotten older.

Growing up, I was expected to help out around the house, get good grades, and be involved in extracurricular activities. My brother, on the other hand, was never held to the same standards. He would get praised for doing the absolute bare minimum – like taking out the trash once in a blue moon or managing to get a C on a test he barely studied for.

Recently, things have escalated. My brother dropped out of college last year and has been living at home, working part-time. My parents, particularly my mom, treat him like he's some kind of hero for even having a job, despite the fact that he contributes almost nothing to the household. Meanwhile, I'm juggling a full-time university schedule, a part-time job, and volunteer work to help me get into med school. And yet, any accomplishment of mine is met with a ""good job"" at best.

Last night was the final straw. My brother came home with groceries – something he has never done before – and my mom acted like he'd just donated a kidney to a dying child. She went on about how ""helpful"" and ""thoughtful"" he is. I snapped and asked her why she always praises him for doing the bare minimum while ignoring everything I do. She got defensive and told me that my brother is ""trying his best.""

I pointed out that I've been trying my best for years without any of the praise he gets, and she exploded, saying I was being disrespectful and causing drama. My dad and brother both told me to drop it and apologize, but I refused. I ended up leaving the house to cool off, but things have been tense ever since.

I can't help but feel that there's some underlying misogyny here. It seems like my mom has different expectations for me because I'm a woman, and that my brother gets a free pass because he's a man. My friends agree with me, but my family thinks I'm overreacting and being unfair to my brother.

45,1elpnx9,AITA For telling my wife to drop an issue that our daughter is having at school,"My wife (36F) and I (35M) have 2 kids (10F & 8M).  We live in a school district that has already started school and our kids have been in classes for about 2-3 weeks now.  Our daughter has been having an issue with her lunch being stolen a few times a week.  The school offers breakfast and lunch, but it isn't free.  We always put money in accounts for the kids in case they want to eat school lunch instead of what we pack for them, so our daughter doesn't go hungry even if her lunch is taken.  She also doesn't have any dietary restrictions.

My wife works night shift as a nurse, so I am the one getting the kids up and ready for school in the morning, including packing lunches.  And yes, I put their names on everything.  My daughter has told me every time that her lunch was taken.  The first few times I asked her to just eat school lunch, but she doesn't always like what they offer.  So, I started making 2 lunches for her and told her to hide one in her backpack instead of bringing it into the classroom where the other lunches are.  

I've also talked with her teacher about it and she said she would be more vigilant about the lunches.  But that hasn't stopped them from being stolen.  My daughter is not the only one having this issue.  My wife is up in arms about it and wants to bring it up to the principal, superintendent, school board, etc.  She thinks that whoever is stealing from our daughter is a thief and has some kind of grudge against our daughter.  I, however, have a different view on it.

The way I see it, whoever is taking lunches probably needs that food more than my daughter does.  If their family had means of providing packed lunches, I would assume they would do so.  Same goes for putting money in an account for school lunch.  My feeling is that whichever kid is stealing lunches is hungry and I don't want to compound that by making this a bigger issue.  The teacher is already aware and I don't feel we need to elevate this beyond that.  

Our family is not in dire straights financially.  We do just fine.  But I know that isn't the case for everyone.  And if packing 2 lunches for my daughter means that a hungry kid gets a solid meal, I'm ok with it coming out of our pockets.  

My wife and I got into an argument about this because she wants to send an email to anyone and everyone at the school district that she feels ""needs to know about this.""

She quickly went over to him as it seemed urgent, but when she asked what he needed he only asked if she had gone to my grandmothers yet or not (Mum and I visit them every evening). When she said she hadn't, he harshly dismissed her and said she should do that first.

I presume it bled for a while and it was hurting, but then it stopped bleeding. I understand he must be in pain, but he also drove to have dinner in the office post this incident. And then went to see the doctor with his flatmate. It was 9/10pm and the emergency doc advised him to get surgery done (normal or plastic). But then after half an hour did his dressing, gave him injection and asked him to go home. Now my boyfriend asked me to visit him in the night and he knows I don’t like travelling in the city in the night by myself, and I live 1 hour away from him. I only got back home from his flat this morning. I told him it doesn’t make any sense for me to visit him only to come back home in the morning. I just feel like he exaggerates small stuff and he just needed me to make all this effort so that he could feel better. Idk. I have been working so much and only got off work at 9pm. The past week had been too hectic for me, he knows this and expects me to do back and forth because he got injured. His flatmate was there with him the entire time and was going to go in the morning also with him to see the doctor. I don’t know I sometimes feel like he behaves like a baby and needs too much attention. I have grown up around men who when they get hurt don’t bother about it so much or even in severe conditions go to the hospital by themselves, get better and come back home without dropping a sweat. 

Am I being too insensitive? Why is this bothering me? I plan on marrying him someday and I don’t know I already feel like in a lot of ways he would be needy.. do men change after marriage and having responsibility on their shoulders? Tbh I didn’t even understand why would he need his roommate also to go with him, for a thing like this? Like he expects him to wake up early morning so both of them could go to the doctor together and he asked me to join as well since I didn’t go in the night?

Any advise would be helpful. I would also post a few other things that bother me about my boyfriend in the comment section below. I really need some solid advise here. I love him but I am not able to ignore certain things about him.

Also, this is my first post on reddit. ",No A-holes here,2024-08-06,"AITA for not visiting my boyfriend in the night after he got a broken toe nail? So basically my boyfriend went to play football and broke his toe nail into half. I presume it bled for a while and it was hurting, but then it stopped bleeding. I understand he must be in pain, but he also drove to have dinner in the office post this incident. And then went to see the doctor with his flatmate. It was 9/10pm and the emergency doc advised him to get surgery done (normal or plastic). But then after half an hour did his dressing, gave him injection and asked him to go home. Now my boyfriend asked me to visit him in the night and he knows I don’t like travelling in the city in the night by myself, and I live 1 hour away from him. I only got back home from his flat this morning. I told him it doesn’t make any sense for me to visit him only to come back home in the morning. I just feel like he exaggerates small stuff and he just needed me to make all this effort so that he could feel better. Idk. I have been working so much and only got off work at 9pm. The past week had been too hectic for me, he knows this and expects me to do back and forth because he got injured. His flatmate was there with him the entire time and was going to go in the morning also with him to see the doctor.

49,1elosyi,AITA for sharing a list of baby names that often get misspelled with my brother?,"I'm a teacher and I have two children with my husband. When we were first expecting a baby we talked about what we wanted for our child's name and something important to both of us was a name that was unlikely to be misspelled. Using my experience as a teacher I compiled a list of boy and girl names that this tends to be a problem with. I also included another list of names that, while easy to spell generally, have many different spellings that are considered correct and could be annoying (Haley, Hayley, Hailee, Haleigh, Hailey as a big example). The list is pretty long. Some of the names people would be like omg no, that's not misspelled often but I have heard of it happening enough that it made it onto the list.

My brother and SIL are expecting a baby together. He wanted to avoid names that have a high risk of being misspelled so he asked me if I would make a copy of the list to share with him. Of course I said yes. And I saw no possible from sharing the list. But SIL was not happy. She didn't like that I had any part of the decision. My brother told her it would be a good resource to have while they searched for names. She told him the list was way too long and it wasn't my place. They argued and eventually asked SILs sister, who is an L&D nurse, if she could confirm the names I wrote can be misspelled somewhat often. She confirmed the names. Said nothing I had added was wrong. She clarified, like I had, that it didn't guarantee it would happen but often does.

SIL still didn't like it and she asked me if I had saved the list to interfere in other people's naming of their kids. I said no. I kept it because my husband and I didn't know if we would have more children together. But I wouldn't deny sharing with someone else because it's not a list of names that I'm telling people to use and I told her I'm not even saying not to use them. Just that in my experience as a teacher who speaks to kids, they get misspelled.

SIL said it wasn't my place to share any list.

I (20F) recently moved in with my dad and his family for the first time. I grew up an only child, so my only knowledge of life with ""siblings"" is with my friends. My friends and I share everything, new or old.

I tend to be the scapegoat in my dad's family and am blamed for things that had nothing to do with me. I say this only to say that I sometimes lose sight of where the lines are. If something would be fine in my mom's house or with my friends, it's often the end of the world here. That being said, I struggled to find my footing in college and am taking a year to figure out what I'm doing with my life before going back to college, with the goal of not wasting money on frivolous classes. My dad and his wife let me move into their house for the year, but it's quickly becoming a toxic environment, and I'm not sure how much I'm contributing without realizing.

My step mom just took my siblings - stepbrother (20M), half sister (13F), half sister (6F) - shopping for new clothing. Everyone got more clothing in this one trip than I've gotten in the last few years. I will admit I felt left out, but this is something my stepmom (44F) does often, so I just chalked it up to that and moved on.

My 13F sister and I share a room and therefore share clothing. This has not been a problem in the past. My sister bought 4 new pairs of jeans while on this trip with my stepmom. She's worn 3 of the 4 already. I was going out with a friend last weekend and wore the last pair of new jeans my sister got, as they looked cute and I didn't think it would be a problem. My friends and I have not thought twice of doing this, so I didn't think it was an issue in this situation either. 

My dad and stepmom are now threatening to kick me out of the house because I wore her pair of new jeans before she had the chance to do so. I didn't know this was going to be a problem, but I'm wondering if I'm being unfair or ignorant since I have never had siblings in my life like this.

So Reddit, please help - AITA for wearing my sister's last pair of new jeans before she did? I've already apologized to everyone, but I just feel like it's not as big of a deal as they're making it out to be. Am I wrong? How should I handle this?

53,1elo01d,AITA refusing a fish tank?,"Hi reddit, I'm currently having an argument with my flatmate, and it's making me feel like I'm completely insane. 

I (27M) live with three friends (27M, 28F, 26F). One of my housemates, Steve, has for the past week been joking about getting a fishtank, and mentioning how good it would look in our living room. I engaged in this in a mostly good natured way, but said several times you're not getting a fish tank. I have several reasons why (I don't think he'd clean it properly being the biggest one), but beforehand it mostly seemed like a bit of banter about him getting a fishtank. He'd say ""I'm actually getting a fishtank, watch, you'll love it"". 

We at no point believed he was actually getting a fishtank, and we've had chats like this before about jokey items (one time Steve wanted a ten foot crash mat to practice backflips on that the girls shot down). 

Today however whilst me and one of my other flatmates Evie was home, Steve announced to us that he had purchased a fishtank foreal, and that it had been delivered to our neighbour while we were all out, waiting for one of us to pick it up. When we didn't believe him, he then went round and came back with two massive boxes, one of which is literally the size of small two-man sofa, and then opened them to show that they contained a fishtank and a stand.

I had an argument with Steve (Evie also agreed with me) that this is ridiculous and he can't have a fishtank in our house anywhere other than his room. Steve thinks that I am being unfair and unreasonable, as quote ""I thought you would like it and fishtanks are cool"". I do not think it is reasonable for Steve to do something like this without agreement from everyone else in the house, and have made it clear the fishtank is not staying in our living room where Steve wants it.

I feel like I am going mad as Steve seems so surprised with how angry with him I am and doesn't seem to get why it's not ok for him to make a unilateral decision like we suddenly have a huge fishtank in our living room. AITA?

We had been staying with his grandma for awhile for housing but also to take care of her. We’re both fortunate enough that his uncle helped us get an apartment not far from the city. We fixed it up & moved in not long after. 

I have spoken a few times to my bf’s mother whenever he or his family were on facetime with her. We get along pretty okay but I’ve always felt pretty tense with her because she’s a serious woman, with a top tier job, & a harvard degree. Though my bf makes sure to not allow his mom to make me uncomfortable, I still do my best to have a good relationship with her.
Recently however, every time I spoke to her on the phone, she would refer to the apartment we are living in as only my bf’s apartment. Let’s say my bf’s name is Dave. Twice, she has said to me, “Thank you for helping with Dave’s apartment!” Which bugged me a little.
My bf apparently kinda got into an argument with her about it & she said that unless we were married, she wouldn’t say that.

I do wanna clarify that my bf & I are on the same page as marriage. We want it, just simply waiting a tiny bit longer before any proposal. Not that his mother knows of this.

Anyway, the mention of the apartment continued. Whether it was with me or overheard conversation, she constantly referred to it as if it were just my bf’s apartment. 
I’m not one for confrontation but I had enough one day when she was on the phone discussing with my bf about some travel plans we both had for this year. Though we had been talking about the two of us, she brought up leaving the apartment by itself & referred it multiple times as his apartment. Usually this would be something my bf would argue with her about, but I spoke up. I corrected her lightheartedly by saying, “You mean our apartment?”
She tried to awkwardly laugh it off & make some excuse for her “accidentally” saying it. I fake laughed & told her, “No, it’s okay! It’s just that you only refer to it as his apartment. I don’t want you to think I’m only here as if it’s a hotel or something!”

I could tell she was pretty uncomfortable. She changed the subject & ended the call pretty early.

There was more stuff about her that was making me frustrated. I think I just grew tired of her words & actions.

57,1elngn7,"AITA for freaking out about my boyfriend still talking to his ex, when she misses him and doesn’t know about our relationship? ","My boyfriend, Josh, and I recently made our relationship official. However, I discovered he was still messaging his ex, Emily, despite his claim that he had cut contact with her. I saw a message from Emily saying, ""I miss you, Josh,"" which made me very upset. Josh said he still said he loved Emily due to their past trauma bond but reassured me that he didn't love her romantically. He argued that telling Emily about our relationship could harm her, which made me feel uneasy. I demanded he tell her about us by Friday or I would, and while Josh agreed to think about it, I felt guilty for pressuring him.

I spoke to my mother, who thought I was overreacting, but I still worry about whether Josh might be flirting with Emily. Josh has said that I can ask questions for reassurance and that he needs some space to think. I feel conflicted and anxious about the situation, especially since he won’t show me the full messages and hasn't told Emily about us yet. AITA?

Edit: I really don’t want to hear that i should break up with him. Him and i are determined to make it work and im sure he’ll tell her eventually that him and i have a relationship. 

Edit 2: Im determined because there’s so much good in our relationship too, and i think he may tell her about is which is all i want. Because that way it’ll be better for us all in the long run. If he doesn’t tell her i will definitely rethink our relationship, but in hopes that he does tell her, im giving him some time. 

I messaged him again, saying that i think he should tell her. Because the longer we wait the more it’ll hurt HER too. If him and i do work out she will find out eventually.

58,1eln86k,AITA for letting my father's ex meet my baby before him and his current girlfriend?,"Over a decade ago, my father dated ""Nina"" (fake name) for four years. I was a teenager at the time, and we hit it off. After they broke up, she bonded with my mom and eventually became a family friend. My father was aware that me and my sister were still close with Nina. He didn't like it, but he knew he couldn't stop it.

He's been dating ""Polly"" (also a fake name) for four years. I don't mind her, but we're not close and I don't love spending time with her for various reasons.

I had my second baby three weeks ago. When my eldest was born, I had a lot of people who wanted to meet him at the hospital, which became very overwhelming very quickly. So this time, my husband and I decided we would make better efforts to control who visited.

When I started labor, my father let me know he was out of town for work and wouldn't be able to come see me at the hospital. He asked if Polly could come on her own, but she's weird about babies and made me very uncomfortable when my son was born, so I told my father I preferred she waited for him to return.

I was in the hospital for 3 days after my daughter was born. When Nina called to congratulate me, I ended up inviting her over, as she worked nearby and was very helpful during my pregnancy. She agreed, and met my baby the day before we went home.

My father and Polly came to my place and met my daughter a little more than a week after she was born. Later, they started talking to my son (he's 4), who mentioned Aunt Nina had seen his baby sister at the hospital. They both left about an hour later.

After the kids went to bed, my father confronted me about what my son had said. He said he was offended I'd allowed his ex to meet my baby before him and his girlfriend. Apparently, Polly was very hurt as well.

I told them I didn't mean to offend anyone, but I had the right to choose who visited me after a major medical procedure. I don't think who gets to meet my baby first (which wasn't Nina, it was my mom this time) is a big deal. I also reminded them of the reasons I didn't want Polly to come on her own.

My father is still offended that Nina met my daughter before he did. I understand where he's coming from, which is why I'm doubting myself.

60,1elmtqp,WIBTA for reporting my mother to Child Protection Services?,"My (21F) and my Fiancé (24M) were asked a few months ago by my Mother (47F) to dog sit for her while she went on a holiday with my siblings, a Sister (18F) and Brother (9M). My childhood was never great, my father (43M) was an all around terrible person towards me and my siblings. My mother only divorced him around Spring of 2022. She always knew of his behaviour.

When I was growing up, and as long as I lived here (was kicked out Winter of 2022) the house was a mess, cluttered with many condition issues and infestations, but upon returning to dogsit for her it has come to my attention it has become a lot worse. The damp and black mold have gotten severe to the point of the ceiling peeling off in places, no appliance works properly. My little brother still sleeps in a bed at the back of my mothers room, and you have to walk over so many things (you can't see the floor) just to get to her bed, and then he walks over her bed and other piles to climb into his own. There are health and safety concerns everywhere. Directly against the advice, the cupboard with the boiler and pipes are blocked with a rack inside it where all the clothes go to dry, with fabrics in immediate proximity. The stairs also have clutter with a banister missing, and the fire alarm is gone. All the vents have been covered by wallpaper or duck tape. There's much more wrong, but I won't elaborate for the sake of being concise, and there's a cage with a guinea pig living in it in the corner of the kitchen.

The holiday they're on is a 3 week trip in America, it was largely funded by my sisters disability money. She has autism and severe social anxiety, and never spends money as she doesn't leave the house. She's terrified of the outdoors, bugs and people. My mum has historically churned credit cards and used them to pay for holidays and designer items, but she no longer is allowed credit cards nor can she receive new ones. The house is rented from the council, and we have always been poor. My little brother has more severe autism. My siblings are completely codependent on my mother and she never taught us any skills and won't get my sister any therapy to help her, and my sister is attached to the dog to the point where she believes she has nothing in life but him.

Since arriving there I have grappled with what I believe to be a moral duty to report this to the council or England's equivalent of CPS, I have consulted with friends who agreed, but my Fiancé is more hesitant on the matter, worrying about my sister if she's separated from the dog and how my brother would cope being separated from family given his issues and the codependence of the whole family. For some more transparency, we were paid £300 to dog sit for the three weeks, with an additional £100 being paid afterwards. The whereabouts of my father are unknown and unable to be contacted.

65,1elknoc,AITA For Something that happened with my Dad?,"I (15M) got caught cheating on a test, and my Dad (who lives across the country from me) told me to go pet my dogs and show them love for him, as that’s all he wanted from me. There’s been some type of issue that I have that I get really uncomfortable when I show affection to an animal in front of people. I have no problem hanging out with my dogs, but comments such as “oh you’re so cute together” just make me uncomfortable, and it’s really difficult to explain.

When I FaceTimed my Dad, I faked petting them, to make him happy, which my Mom called out, making my Dad hang up very quickly after. I told my Mom about my reasons for fake petting, as she did not know why I was “trying to provoke my Dad”, as I wasn’t doing it to provoke him, but to avoid comments that made me feel really weird. My Mom understood the story but told me to tell my Dad. Not as a way to justify, but to explain.

When I told my Dad my true reasons, he texted me back saying:

“Whatever 🤬! I don’t care what happened 10 years ago you need to get over it and when I ask you to do something you need to do it.”

For extra context, my Dad did not know that I had an issue with affection towards animals in front of a camera.

66,1elkmmt,AITA for telling my friend who moved in with us to leave?,"CrossPosted from r/AITAH

Disclaimer- this is my throwaway!

Reddit,

I (26F) have been friends with ""Roomie"" (26F) since 5th grade. We met at Sunday school and went to different schools but got close again in college, partied together a lot, and even have matching tattoos. Recently, Roomie moved in with my family and things have gotten really tense.

For some background, my husband (35M) and I have a son who is almost 3. Roomie has had a lot of medical issues which have made it hard for her to work, but she has been working as a camp teacher until the end of this week. My husband did not want her to move in with us, but I pushed for it and he finally agreed. Roomie knew that I had to argue with my husband to get her a place to live with us rent-free. She moved into my office space and has been here since the end of May/early June.

Since moving in, she has asked me for money a few times, which is fine because she always pays me back. But when I couldn't lend her money once, she got upset and said it didn't feel like we were friends anymore. She also gets upset when I ask if she left something out or has a plan for something she left in the kitchen.

This morning, she told me it was only two weeks left to be civil, and I said if that was too much time we could move it up. She then said she'd leave today but hasn't moved anything yet. I told her she could stay until the weekend if she wanted, but she reiterated that she'd be gone today and then sent me relatively shitty texts insinuating that I only care about her when she's happy and not when she's low. (I do care, I just can't be her punching bag anymore.)

So, AITA for basically ending the friendship and telling her to leave if she doesn't like it here? I feel like I could be at fault because I told her I wouldn't kick her out the day her seasonal job ended, but I sort of did and told her she could leave if she wasn't liking it here. I want her out now after today's conversation. If I'm the asshole, I'll wait until the original date, but part of me wants to tell her to get out ASAP.

Thanks for your thoughts. ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-06,"AITA for telling my friend who moved in with us to leave? CrossPosted from r/AITAH

My parents got divorced when I was 2 years old, and my mom became depressed after, which lasted for about 10 years. She also started blaming my (now deceased) stepmother for taking my dad away from her.
Anyway, due to my mom's state I developed PTSD and an eating disorder, which caused me to gain a lot of weight. My mom has always hated the fact that I got fat, and made loads of snide remarks, including ""You're so fat you almost look pregant"", or clicking her tongue and saying ""What a shame"" while looking at me. She also ruined quite a few important moments in my life by either not showing up, or making them all about herself. 

So I went wedding dress shopping this weekend. I took my two best friends, and my future MIL and SIL (who welcome me with open arms and are amazing people).
Today, the save the date cards have started arriving. My mom called to tell me she received it, and then asked about the dress. I told her I already picked one out and she replied that she was very hurt and that I am a nasty person by not inviting her. I tried to explain to her that she has always made remarks about my weight and my looks, and that I was scared of having that special moment ruined, and she said she never said things like that.

73,1eliowb,AITA for opening up to my grandma instead of/before my parents?,"I (17m) recently, like really recently, met my half siblings for the first time. They're my dad's kids from his first marriage. They're way older than me. Like 30s/40s and married with kids and all that stuff. Their mom died, dad remarried my mom, had my two sisters (20f, 19f) and then me. They saw dad and talked to him on the phone but they were never involved in our immediate family. They had contact with our grandma and shared aunts, uncles, cousins and honorary aunts and uncles. But they weren't a part of our lives and they didn't include us (except for dad) in theirs. I always knew they existed. My parents talked about them to us. They just weren't around.

So it surprised us and was kinda weird to us when dad said we'd get to meet them. Grandma turned 85 a few weeks ago and we were all there. Dad made a big effort to introduce us during the party and it was so clear they didn't want to be introduced. They moved away as soon as they could. They talked to dad a few times. Even seemed to seek him out. But they didn't ever look happy to be near us or our mom. Their spouses and kids also kept a distance. It wasn't super clear unless you were checking but we did. My sisters had really wanted to get to know them but realized like I did that they didn't want to talk to us. They also overheard them telling their kids that we were some people who were there. Not even family. My sisters took it harder than me.

It bothered me a little after. Like they don't need to be okay with me but it felt kinda hostile honestly. I knew my parents had this idea that now we'd all met we'd be more like an actual family. Only that's really not going to happen. I don't think we'll ever have a conversation. Or interact more after that minor thing at the party. I was sad about that for my sisters who really did hope for a relationship with them, and really I only realized when they heard we'd get to meet them.

It got to me a little and I talked to grandma. I told her I didn't think I'd ever see them again or if I did, I didn't expect them to acknowledge I'm there, that I felt some hostility from them and stuff. Grandma heard me out and gave me grandma hugs. She also told me she'd never be mad about it. That it wasn't my fault. But she also acknowledged that my parents were hoping for more. I told her I didn't think it could happen and I didn't really want to if they felt hostile about us or were unwilling to acknowledge us as more than just some people who were there to their kids.

One of my uncles stopped by while I was with grandma. He heard what I said and spoke to my parents about it. They were so mad I went to grandma instead of them. They told me I should talk to them about this stuff.

74,1elioc4,AITA for telling a white lie about hitting a vape,"I 23F have recently been on a journey of quitting vaping. I've been doing really well except it's really hard when I'm around my boyfriend because he still actively vapes. If you've ever tried to quit you know it's hardest when there is one still around you. We also live together. Recently I told a white lie, about hitting his vape behind his back. I told him I wasn't trying to sneak it but I was. I didn't want him to know because he would get mad because I've asked him to help me quit. But sometimes the temptation is difficult. My boyfriend came to me and said he's upset that I lied about it. To me it wasn't a big deal because it was over a vape... but he explained that he doesn't understand why I would lie about something so small and its not about the vape.

",Asshole,2024-08-06,"AITA for telling a white lie about hitting a vape I 23F have recently been on a journey of quitting vaping. I've been doing really well except it's really hard when I'm around my boyfriend because he still actively vapes. If you've ever tried to quit you know it's hardest when there is one still around you. We also live together. Recently I told a white lie, about hitting his vape behind his back. I told him I wasn't trying to sneak it but I was. I didn't want him to know because he would get mad because I've asked him to help me quit. But sometimes the temptation is difficult. My boyfriend came to me and said he's upset that I lied about it. To me it wasn't a big deal because it was over a vape... but he explained that he doesn't understand why I would lie about something so small and its not about the vape.

In the beginning it was of course all happy and i was happy for her because he seemed like a good guy, but lately they’ve been getting into arguments over petty things. Example: They have each other Instagram account and my Bsf saw a girl on his account who was posting explicit pictures of herself. She asked her Bf if she could block said girl, he said yes. Then they got into it about something (i truly can’t remember) and he unblocked her. This causing another argument. From what i see every time they get into an argument it’s never his fault. In the argument with the girl he told her to stop talking to him. so she did, he then proceeded to get mad at her for not talking to him. I stepped in telling him that he’s being a hypocrite. He then proceeded to break up with my bsf then blamed me for the breakup saying “U did it not me”. Then they got back together and the other did he asked her to send him some money, in the beginning of the relationship he told my bsf not to send him money. So she said no obviously. He got mad. There are many many many more instances like this where he’ll tell her one thing and then gets mad when she does. I have told her many times that this is not healthy and she needs to either talk to him about it or break up. I am starting to lose my patience with him and her and want to know if i would be wrong if i told her that if she doesn’t want to leave him to suck it up.

80,1elgsi5,AITA for telling my roommate its their fault my dog eats their food,"hi again reddit. so I (22) live with two roommates, Lilo (22) and Cam (26). It's a small house and Lilo and I both own dogs, both are big-large breeds.

Lilo's dog Ant is a 2y/o extremely high energy working breed. My dog, Horse, is a 3 y/o rescue i adopted nearly a year ago. he was extremely neglected and had a lot of behavioral problems before coming here, but has come an extremely long way. But he isnt perfect and im still working on it with him every day.

that's where the issue lies. Horse eats any food left out. hes big enough that he can jump onto our kitchen counters, and we quickly learnt that no food could be left out and unsupervised. we had a discussion and all agreed that we'd do our best to keep food stored properly and keep our meals close by.

ive been trying to train him out of it in the meantime, but the reward of stealing food far out ways any ethical training/reprimand i give him. i told my roommates this, and that while id continue trying to train it out, he might never be safe around their food, and that any time he steals their food, it sends me ten steps backwards, as it enforces the behaviour.

despite all agreements and conversations, over the past year, Lilo will constantly leave food out, in reach, in a room he has access to, and then walk away for stretches of time. he is constantly getting her food and drinks, which she then complains about to me. note its only Lilo, as Cam has no issues putting food away or just being aware.

well tonight lilo complained Horse had eaten some of a meal she made after she left the room. i told her its her fault for leaving, knowing him and what weve all agreed on. AMITA?

EDIT for more context, since ive been repeating the same thing constantly: When im not home and unable to supervise, he's in my room, or a main room when no ones there, but my roommates are happy to put him in my room if they dont want him around once thye get home. the issue is mainly because when he is let out by roommates (when im not there) so they can play/cuddle, Lilo often has food out and about. tonight it was Lilo letting my dog inside, i was at work, even though they had a tray of food on the bench, and it was then eaten when they left the room. I wasnt home for this.

also to people telling me its easy to train a dog raised like he was out of eating food: tell me youve never delt with a dog with behavioural issues without telling me youve never delt with a dog with behavioural issues.

yes i train my dog. no he isnt horribly behaved, and any situations i know he wont behave well in, i do my best to supurvise him and keep him close to me. for the most part, hes just a happy, lazy couch potato content to cuddle up with you, or run around the yard with Ant.

BUT i accept im also the asshole in this because hes my dog, as i suspected. ill talk wuth my roommates more, particularly Lilo, about leaving him in my room when im not around to save their food while im still training.



  
**LAST UPDATE:: guess i should have known that animal content would get people riled up... anyway! spoke with my roommate this morning and apologised for saying it was their fault, but told them in future to leave my dog in my room when im not here. i also asked them if there was anything i could do to make it easier to live with my dog.**

**this subreddit is probably used to adults communicating like toddlers in AITA posts, so i want to say, my roommates and i get along like a house on fire. we communicate with eachother like adults and are great friends, this was a very minor issue i wanted an outside perspective on, so thank you. its just a bit annoying that a lot of people seem to assume we are living in a constantly divisive hatful situation. our home is lovely, we all communicate openly and honestly, and our dogs are happy. its a small house yes, but with a massive yard they both enjoy sprinting through, and cuddling up in the sun together in.** ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-06,"AITA for telling my roommate its their fault my dog eats their food hi again reddit. so I (22) live with two roommates, Lilo (22) and Cam (26).

81,1elghca,AITA for defending myself with my sister after taking legal custody of my nephew?,"My husband (30m) and I (30f) won legal custody of my nephew Kian (15m) in June. Since September 2022 Kian had been living with us on and off. It started out with the intent to be temporary. But my sister would take Kian back and then send him to live with us again. She'd visit him frequently at times and then go weeks without any contact. She'd vent to me about it. Then she'd complain that we weren't fulfilling our end of the agreement. Kian wanted to stay with me, my husband and our children. We knew it wasn't good for Kian to have the back and forth and inconsistency. We knew he wanted to be with us. So we asked the courts to give us legal custody instead of having a family agreement going on. Even during court proceedings my sister would take Kian back and then send him to us again. A therapist was involved, someone from CPS, and they ultimately decided my husband and I should have custody.

To explain background. Kian is my sister's oldest child. She had him with her late husband Sean. Sean died when Kian was 5. When Kian was 7 my sister met her second husband and she married him about 18 months after they first met. She now has more children with her second husband. Kian was distant with them from the start. He was civil to my sister's husband but also expressed that he didn't want his mom to get married again. My sister chose to ignore it at the time and convinced herself that Kian would come around and would love having a dad in the house again. He was disinterested in his younger half siblings from the start and it was only when my sister read some homework Kian had done and had answered a question with ""I don't have siblings"" she started to take it seriously. My sister decided they needed family therapy. Kian was open that he didn't have any feelings for his half siblings or stepdad. He hated spending time with them and wished it could be just him and his parents again. They had some homework to do. Kian's honesty during the homework, that he would never treasure memories with his half siblings, was when my sister first asked us to take him in. She wanted him to work on that. She hoped distance would make him realize he did care or would make him more willing to try. But it didn't, it hasn't. He likes not seeing them. He likes seeing my sister, misses her and gets upset when he doesn't but he has never once missed his stepdad or half siblings.

My sister is furious we went for legal custody and even more furious that we won. She asked how I could do that and I told her we had spoken about the upheaval not being good for anyone. But she was still back and forth with Kian. I told her I had to put him first when she was making his life so unstable. She asked how I could defend myself when I made sure Kian can't reconcile with them now. I told her she could still see him, the judge even said it. And she could always work on committing to him. She said I was punishing her just as much as Kian is and she'll never forgive me for it.

My mom has asked in lue of me paying rent and food I need to do the dishes and run errands for her. By errands I mean every single delivery and person that comes to the property needs to be collected by me. I work from home this can be disruptive but I don't mind. I usually wash the pots and pans in the dish washer. My mom asks me to not do this anymore, my response to her was if this is the case can she just put hot water and soap in the pots as soon as she is done cooking, becuase I do not have the time, nor do I want to, scrub pots for hours because there is sauce dried and burnt into it. Her response was that I am ungrateful and that becuase she buys the food, cooks and works a lot I should scrub the pot.

For clarity, I do not mind washing the pot all I want is for who ever cooks to put hot water and soap in the pot after cooking so it easier to clean.

am I really being unreasonable asking for who ever is cooking to just put hot water and soap in the pots to make cleaning easier?

Edit: extra context and clarification. I cook for myself most days or eat at my gf's place my mom maybe cooks for me personally 2 nights a week. I still clean both sets of dishes and I DO NOT MIND.

Second: I pay for my mom's car insurance, fuel and car maintenance as part of rent. I also pay for other extra expenses when I can afford it.

And lastly many people keep saying I should just wash the pot. I never said I won't wash the pot. Washing the pot is not the issue here. I asked a simple question to my mom and she answered by saying hurtful and demeaning things to me. I won't repeat them because that isn't the point.

And if I am an asshole for believing that just because you are helping someone while they are in a shit time of their lives it doesn't mean they lose all autonomy and deserve to at least be heard then I will wear that badge with pride!",No A-holes here,2024-08-06,"AITA for asking my mom to put hot water and soap in the pots after she is done cooking?

85,1eldr3x,AITA for going home?,"m going to try to keep this short… I (26, F) went to help my cousin (28, F) look for apartments in a major city. She called me crying a couple days ago saying she needs a friend to support her during this time so we agreed to meet to do some tours. For context, we live in a high traffic area so it can take 1-2 hours to get to her. We completed about six tours, found her future apartment, went out to eat twice, and went out to a bar after dinner… totaling about 12 hours total. I am a teacher soaking up the last few days of summer so I was able to block off the day and was honestly expecting it to take that long. Here’s the trouble: we don’t always have great communication (I can be passive and she can be passive aggressive). Over the course of the day she said/did things that irritated me (one being accepting the money I offered as a *courtesy* for my birthday lunch that she suggested we have between tours). I really try not to let the things my cousin says or does impact me because I know she doesn’t REALLY mean any harm. 

Around 10 PM we start driving her car from the bar to current apartment so I can pick up my car and go home. We arrived to the huge parking garage outside her building that requires a clicker to get in. My cousin and her partner share a clicker, so it’s usually most convenient to just follow a neighbor into the garage as they enter. Sharing the clicker has been a huge inconvenience and point of contention in their relationship, but for some reason, they won’t buy another one. As we’re sitting at the front of the parking garage I see a bunch of cars entering that can give us access to our spot. When I ask her why we’re not going in she explains that her girlfriend is going to come bring us the clicker, which is not unusual, but kind of annoying because the girlfriend has to trek from the 12th floor  to the parking garage. It would be quicker to just follow another car through. After about 10 minutes of waiting, I ask where the girlfriend is and my cousin explains that she’s in the bath/ finishing up some emails so she’ll be down when she’s done. I asked my cousin if there was a way for me to get to my car without the clicker …

she says “yes, but what’s the rush?”

I made up a dumb excuse for needing to leave to which she explains that she can open it, but reasserted that just doesn’t understand what the rush is. I was kinda dumbfounded because why would I not want to start my commute home after being in the city for 12 hours, it was 10:30 and I was tired.  We were both exhausted and repeated that sentiment multiple times at the end of the day… I thought we were on the same page. Through her irritation she opened the pedestrian gate so I could walk through the garage and get my car. She’s still explaining to me that it hasn’t been more than 5 five minutes and that her girlfriend will be right down. I told her I didn’t want to argue and walked away. We see each other all the time so I don’t think it was a “ soak up every moment” thing.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why she wanted me to wait. I know others cannot *make* us feel anything, but I definitely felt like a whiny little brat for not waiting.

86,1eldqsz,AITA for refusing to give any of the money my late father gave me before his death to his widow and other children?,"I (33m) was estranged from my father for over a decade. It had been a very long time coming when I did finally decide to become estranged at 20. I had already moved out when I was 17 and I had made sure to limit my contact with my father before ending all ties between us. A lot of this had to do with the decisions he made while my mom was terminally ill and after her death. This ranged from trying to sleep with mom's sister while mom was still alive, to yelling at my mom while she was sick for being so sick, to burning several family photos of us in the days after mom died. He also sold my mom's easel which she'd had most of her life and was sentimentally valuable to not just me, but my aunts and uncles also. I was 13 at the time. My dad ended up damaging a lot of mom's stuff when he met his second wife and moved her in. To move her in he moved my mom out. In the process a lot of harm came to mom's things. My aunts and uncles took them and stored them and we went through them when I was 20.

I was completely no contact with my dad until his death almost a year ago. Even when I was informed he had transferred a lot of money over to me and had put my name on the deed of a family vacation home he and my mom had owned prior to her death. That was the biggest chunk of everything he owned. He never told his wife/now widow. He also didn't own the house they were living in and that we had all lived in prior. It was his friends house. I was never sure how it worked but he never paid for it while I was living there (3 years for me).

After he died a letter was sent to me where he told me he had given me all of that so it was mine outright and because he wanted to make up for his mistakes in a small way.

His leaving me with so much meant there was basically nothing for his wife and the other children they had. Only what he had in joint accounts and no property. It was all legally binding. His widow attempted to sue for a fair share of my father's assets but her case did not go far because it had been handled prior to his passing and was 100% legally mine. I didn't go to the funeral or anything so I was surprised to hear from her, and I still don't know where she got contact info for me, or my father for that matter. She told me I should be looking after my family and I should want better for the children she and my father shared at least. She made it clear she expected me to want a relationship. I told her I did not and I did not consider her children my family, because her late husband stopped being my family a long time ago. She said it wasn't fair that I could be so cold to my flesh and blood and that they got screwed over by their father and then by me. She said I owed them something. I told her I didn't. I ended the call and blocked her but she reached out to me through social media and called me selfish and cruel and how I had no morals.

88,1eldk34,AITA for trying to stop my boyfriend from kidnapping a baby crow to be a pet?,"EDIT - OP uses he/him pronouns, please



I love my boyfriend very much. He has a very sweet heart and is usually kind to me and also to all of the pets that we have at home. At work his job has him going outside in a van at night and tending to different things, and he encounters some wildlife from time to time. Today, he found a young bird perched atop something that he was working on. He tried to encourage it to fly, which it didn't, though it didn't seem injured. He decided to take this bird (which I identified as a juvenile crow with help from AI and various guides from the images) into the van and take care of it. He said that 'we have a new pet' now, that 'she likes me' and that he would put it in a box outside of our home and that she could fly away if she wanted to, and that he thought she might get 'mauled by a coyote' in her present location. I questioned the wisdom of this as our local built environment (in a different city) is considerably different to the one from which she was taken, and we also have some cats with no fixed abode around.

Having done some research, I found out that it is quite normal for young crows to not be able to fly well, and suggested that he return her to where she was taken, or, if he really feels he needs to take her in then we should deliver her to a rehabilitation expert. He said he explained his plan to keep her as a pet because he thought I'd support it, and told me to 'not go all spca \[sic\]'. I told him that he needs to take the conservation advice from the local charity's site, or to the charity itself in the daytime. I am not sure about here, but in some countries, animal protection charities sometimes try to bring private prosecutions for cruelty, so possibly he was worried about that, but I was just trying to see to it that the bird was looked after.

I was really assertive about the suggestion because I thought that it was really important to see that the bird was taken care of. He reiterated that he thought the bird would be 'fine with \[him\]', but I reinstated my belief that she needed to be near her parents. He then started telling me to 'go away', that he doesn't 'have a bird anymore' and that '\[he's\] working leave \[him\] alone'. He really doubled down on saying stuff like this, and then in some frustration I said 'I don't want to be with someone who treats animals like this' and then he started swearing over and over again and telling me I don't know when to stop, that I'd 'choose an \[expletive\] bird over him.'

I just really wanted to make sure we did the right thing. In the moment, I suppose it's maybe seemed like I'm chastising him or trying to get him in trouble, or bothering him while working. I wonder have I blown this totally out of proportion?

89,1elczse,AITA for my behaviour at a buffet?,"Hi everyone, I (28F) recently reconnected with a friend (27F) from high school. Let's name her ""Brenna"". We were really close (like, think inseparable) but the distance after we moved away inevitably caused our friendship to dwindle. I recently moved to her city with my husband and it was like nothing had changed. After a few 1 on 1 lunches, she wanted to introduce me to some of her other friends from uni. We decided on an upscale buffet at a hotel.

I think it's relevant to include that the university she went to was known for its extremely wealthy and privileged students. Coming from an upper-middle class background, I wasn't really sure what to expect or what we'd have to connect on, but she assured me it'd be okay and that everyone was really ""down to earth.""

I got along with everyone really well. The conversations were engaging and we all bounced off of each other really nicely with the banter. She booked it on a Monday afternoon so it'd be (relatively) less crowded, so none of us would have trouble communicating. But here is where I think everything went wrong: There was a short queue behind me (3 people, all in our party, one of whom included Brenna) while I was trying to scoop a stew for myself. It was a minestrone and I had accidentally grabbed a scoopful of vegetables instead of soup. So on my second scoop, I decided to do the opposite so that I could get a balance of both (my first scoop hardly contained any soup). I stopped after two scoops and turned to see Brenna staring at me with an appalled expression. I was really puzzled but I kept on walking back to our table so I wasn't blocking anyone's way, and I figured I should ask her about it later.

The rest of the lunch, I noticed Brenna acting really strange. She was limiting her interactions with me, avoiding eye contact with me, etc. Another friend (28M) even asked her about this and she dismissed the question (she said ""I don't know what you're talking about"").

After we all said goodbye, I got a series of texts from Brenna saying how disgustingly ""low class"" I acted in front of her friends. I asked her what she meant and she referred to how I selectively scooped the minestrone in front of her and how ""it's extremely poor etiquette to pick and choose portions at a buffet."" I tried explaining to her it was an accident, and I hadn't intentionally tried to do what she was explaining but she said I was still ""holding up the line."" I apologized for that and she hasn't responded since.

I apologized to the 2 other people that were waiting behind me but they didn't know what I was talking about. I explained to them what Brenna saw and they said she's being a ""pompous ass"" and told me to forget about it. Now I have no idea what to feel because I initially felt extremely guilty when Brenna confronted me but hearing these 2 say it's no big deal is really making me wonder. I would love some other opinions. Thanks.

Hi everyone, I (28F) recently reconnected with a friend (27F) from high school. Let's name her ""Brenna"". We were really close (like, think inseparable) but the distance after we moved away inevitably caused our friendship to dwindle. I recently moved to her city with my husband and it was like nothing had changed. After a few 1 on 1 lunches, she wanted to introduce me to some of her other friends from uni. We decided on an upscale buffet at a hotel.

I think it's relevant to include that the university she went to was known for its extremely wealthy and privileged students. Coming from an upper-middle class background, I wasn't really sure what to expect or what we'd have to connect on, but she assured me it'd be okay and that everyone was really ""down to earth.""

I got along with everyone really well. The conversations were engaging and we all bounced off of each other really nicely with the banter. She booked it on a Monday afternoon so it'd be (relatively) less crowded, so none of us would have trouble communicating. But here is where I think everything went wrong: There was a short queue behind me (3 people, all in our party, one of whom included Brenna) while I was trying to scoop a stew for myself. It was a minestrone and I had accidentally grabbed a scoopful of vegetables instead of soup. So on my second scoop, I decided to do the opposite so that I could get a balance of both (my first scoop hardly contained any soup). I stopped after two scoops and turned to see Brenna staring at me with an appalled expression. I was really puzzled but I kept on walking back to our table so I wasn't blocking anyone's way, and I figured I should ask her about it later.

I told him that I am not okay with it as one of the friends he is planning to take it with is super untrustworthy and already put him in unsafe situations before and along with that resents me. This would be the third time he has taken shrooms and I have told him countless times that I am uncomfortable with it because of past relationships i’ve been in where substances were abused including shrooms. The first time he had taken them was back in December and it was after a long argument ending in him saying “It’s my life and I’m going to do what I want.” 

I’ve tried explaining to him in a few different ways on why I am uncomfortable with him taking substances. I used to abuse prescription pills and other various substances, so it’s not like i’m in the dark about what taking anything is like. The few people I’ve dated and been friends with had overall abused every substance they took and it completely effected my relationship with them. The past two times my boyfriend has taken shrooms he has told me he would not continue using them until I was okay with it and that he would be sober of everything for a while.

I understand that he wants to have fun and I don’t care if he smokes weed or drinks in regulation but I’m not comfortable being around anything else like that, based on my past and what i’ve experienced. 

He always tells me the same thing about how shrooms could positively benefit him as a person and his overall health and I’m open to being more educated on it in the future, but for the moment am not comfortable with him taking them. He has lied about it in the past and just tells me he doesn’t understand why I am uncomfortable with his use of it. Every time I bring it up from a different perspective and try to explain how if he was uncomfortable with something I was doing I wouldn’t continue to argue it as long as it’s not outlandish. He constantly compares it to him saying if he was uncomfortable with me leaving my house then I shouldn’t do it. I fully don’t understand how those are even close to the same situation. I have reason to be uncomfortable with substances right now and am not saying that I will never be okay with it ever. I am open to being enlightened on what he wants to do in the future but in the moment would prefer that he respects that i’m uncomfortable being around that.

I received an invitation to my close friend’s wedding, and I was genuinely excited. However, just days before the big day, my family experienced a sudden emergency. My younger brother was hospitalized after an accident, and my parents needed support during this difficult time. I knew I had to be there for my family, so I reluctantly sent my regrets to my friend, hoping they would understand.

When the day arrived, I received a message from my friend expressing disappointment that I couldn’t attend. I felt terrible knowing how much they valued my presence. I quickly explained the situation, detailing my brother’s condition and the need for family support. I reassured my friend that I truly wished I could celebrate with them, but family had to come first.

Despite my explanation, my friend seemed upset and said my parents would handle that. I was taken aback. I thought they would understand my dilemma. I expressed my love for them and my hope for a future celebration when things settled down.

92,1elbicl,AITA for not adopting my mom's friend's elderly cat and getting a kitten instead?,"A while back I (35M) was visiting my parents and mentioned that I was thinking about getting a cat. I told them it would mean that I would need to avoid walking around my house barefoot for about a year. My mom asked why, and I said it's because kittens are frisky and tend to scratch people's legs, but usually grow out of it as they mature. My mom suggested that I get an adult cat instead as it might be easier. I told her that adult cats come with their own challenges, especially if they've been mistreated. She seemed to understand.

Last week Mom called and said that her friend had a cat, Ryan, whom she unfortunately needed to find a new home for. Ryan is around 12, and Mom's friend adopted him from a rescue shelter when he was about a year old. She loves Ryan very much and the decision to rehome him was very difficult, and wanted to be sure he was going to a loving home. I asked why she needed to rehome him, and she said that both of them have age-related health issues. Her friend has arthritis, and has trouble bending over and holding Ryan's mouth open to give him his daily kidney pill. Ryan is a Maine Coon mix and has very long, thick fur, and now that he's older, he has trouble grooming himself, needs to be brushed regularly, and is prone to hairballs.

I told her I was sorry to hear this but unfortunately I can't take him. She asked why, and I told her that caring for an elderly cat with health problems was not something I was prepared to do, and that he probably wouldn't adjust well to a new home with a new human. She said she understood. A few days later I got my kitten, a 9-week-old rare orange female tabby shorthair whom I've named Tangie (because she tangerine-colored), and I told my mom when I got her but she seems to have forgotten. I love my mom and overall have a wonderful relationship with her, but she does tend to miscommunicate and sometimes forgets things (she's been like this my whole life so I highly doubt she has dementia).

Yesterday, Mom called and said that she had told her friend that her son was thinking about getting a cat, and now her friend has it in her head that I have agreed to take Ryan, and that I agreed to let her come over periodically to see him. Then she said that can't be bothered telling her friend that I changed my mind (WTF?), and insisted that I take him. I said no, and she said that I'm being cruel, and if I don't take Ryan, he might have to be put down (aside from his kidney dysfunction he's healthy and active). I asked her if she asked anyone else if they could take him. She said no. So it's either I take Ryan, or he's put down. We argued for several minutes and she was growing increasingly angry and yelled at me before finally hanging up.

I’m very angry at my mom for trying to guilt trip me, but I also feel bad for her friend, and for Ryan. However, Tangie is my first priority right now until she gets settled.

AITA for not adopting Ryan and getting Tangie instead?


EDIT: I forgot to mention that Ryan has a history of fighting with and seriously injuring other cats, which was something that my mom's friend was aware of when she adopted him from the shelter. I think his original owners waited too long to have him neutered, or maybe he wasn't neutered when he was taken to the shelter. I don't know for sure, but in any case, my mom's friend was told that one of Ryan's requirements was that he be the only cat in the household.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-06,"AITA for not adopting my mom's friend's elderly cat and getting a kitten instead?

93,1elb3yo,AITA for not giving my ex anything from sale of the apartment.,"Backstory:

I 36M bought my apartment 15 years ago, in 2009, as it was my obsession to have my own home.

That means I went to work after trade school and put away half of my monthly salary in a savings account, it was only possible by still living with my parents and their support (the fact that they let me live at home rent-free) for those 2 years and commuting to work every day, which was a 1-hour train ride to the capital city.

I managed to collect enough for a 20% down payment for a home loan, it was a 2-bedroom apartment in the city, that needed to be renovated in an old soviet style building (I live in Estonia).

In 2009, prices were low, as the economic collapse was not long ago.

In the last 15 years, I and my girlfriend (now ex-wife) renovated the whole apartment room by room over the years, the apartment building itself got renovated and looks great, also a new business park was built near the apartment in our district and all of it raised the prices of apartments so much, that when I sold it I got 5,5x more for it than the purchase price.

We also got married.

The story:  
Last summer my ex suddenly had all the red flags:  
She started to carry her phone everywhere like it was a baby, she locked the screen every time I entered a room, she was distant and the list goes on...  
I confronted her and at first, she claimed that ""he is just a friend who understands me"", the classics - but of course, it led straight to divorce, as I was suddenly ""controlling and jealous"".

After the whole drama ended I decided to move back to my childhood town, as with the help of COVID-19 a few years ago home office was suddenly a thing and I never worked in the office anyway anymore, so there was no need to live in the city and for a price of an apartment in the city I got a house in the small town that has everything I need.

When she found out that I was selling the apartment she sent me her account number and told me to pay the 50% I get to that account.  
I told her no, she assumed she would get it because we were married. Later she demanded it because she helped me renovate it and did most cooking etc. I admit, that is true, she is very good at changing wallpapers and painting, she also cooks damn well, but I bought all the materials for renovating, I bought all the furniture. Told her that she could consider all her efforts as rent, but she got really mad.

I have lived now in my new house for a week and she still annoys me, even some of our mutual friends agree with her that I am being an ass for not giving her some money for that apartment. I achieved my dream of loan free life, I am considering blocking everyone who keeps annoying me about it. I heard from a mutual friend that she even wanted to sue me, but the lawyer she talked to recommended to not, as in the situation where she has no bills to even prove she ever contributed anything, she would waste money and lose.

94,1elb21u,AITA for refusing to cancel my plans to return a friends phone ,"I went to one of my best friends bachelorette party on Saturday. The night went smoothly, and we all ended up having a good time. The next morning, one of the bridesmaids boyfriend came to pick her up around the time everyone was packing up to leave. In the shuffle of everything, her boyfriend’s phone ended up in a box of stuff I was bringing home. I discovered this after driving 30 miles away from the house the Bach party was at (for reference, I was picking up my fiancé and then driving 15 more miles back home and then heading out for a beach day I’d had planned for weeks. None of this was close to the bachelorette party at all). 

I called my friend and told her I had her boyfriend’s phone, and gave them the option of meeting me at the diner I was at or meeting me at my house to get the phone. They said they’d swing by my house, and I told them I would be at the beach but my fiancé would be home and have the phone for them.  

About five minutes later, her boyfriend called me back  and started questioning me about how I got his phone. I told him that I had no idea, and that it was pure luck that my fiancé even found it. There was so much going on with cleaning up that it could have been anyone’s fault. He was then demanding that since it was my fault, I drive it all the way back to where he was. He stated “I know you have plans, but I have to drop my girlfriend at home and then drive back to (the city he lives in a few hours away)”. My response was “you’re correct, I do have plans and I have no intention on not going through with them. I won’t get to go to the beach if I have to spend an hour and a half driving your phone to you.” I then further offered to meet him somewhere along the way home for him that wasn’t as far for me, and he absolutely refused to go out of his way. 

We ended up meeting up (very begrudgingly on his behalf) after I told him take it or leave it and that I don’t really care if he has a phone or not. After a very uncomfortable exchange in a parking lot, I didn’t think much of it. 

Flash forward to the next day, he told my friend he didn’t feel bad at all about what had happened and that it’s only right that I missed my plans because I stole his phone. I told my friend the next time I find something of his, I’m going to leave it exactly where I found it and not try to return it to him. 


This all feels so dumb. I think that if someone tries to return your phone, it’s your responsibility to make sure you get your phone. I find it strange that someone wouldn’t just want to get their phone back and be done with it. It’s also strange to demand people do what you say and change their plans around so you aren’t inconvenienced. I thought I was being nice by offering to meet up with him along the way home so neither of us were super inconvenienced. I didn’t think this would turn into such a big deal, but now I’m dreading seeing him at the upcoming wedding.

95,1elargj,AITA for not giving my roommate her bond back when she moved out?,"This happened over a year ago but I would love to know what others think or would do in a similar situation. I, now 29(F) moved in with my best friend (F) Casey (made up name) when we were 26. We moved in the middle of all the covid lockdowns and rent was crazy low, as was our bond.

After the first few months, my roommates girlfriend would come over a lot. After a few months of her always eating the food I bought and using all the amenities, I asked Casey if she was planning on having her girlfriend move in with us. I was completely fine with the idea of it, as long as she was evenly paying for rent, bills and groceries. Long story short, she moved in about a month later.

Things unfortunately went very down hill from here. Casey wanted to make her girlfriend feel at home and sold our dining table (against my wishes) and replaced it with 2 desks and PCs for the two of them which took up most of the living area. My problem was they were always there. They would get home from work and go straight on discord with other friends, screaming at games into the early hours of the morning.

Shorty after Casey's girlfriend moved in, Casey got diagnosed with ADHD and she started to use that as an excuse for everything, including dropping full time work and cut down to 2 days a week. Now I know ADHD is hard but her personality did a full 180 when she was diagnosed...

After about 2 years of dealing with all this we got notice our rent was increasing significantly. My roommate was stressing about the increase as she wasn't earning much with her 2 days of work. We agreed to talk about it when I got home from work, but Casey and her girlfriend told me they had already talked and were going to move out and move in with her parents.

While packing their things, Casey constantly asked me if I wanted to keep her belongings. I stated multiple times that I wanted her to either take all her things with her or throw them out. The day finally came for them to move out and I was at work all day. When I came home I was devastated. She had left so much behind. Cupboards full of rubbish, dishes, medical supplies, clothes, a broken dryer, bookshelf and her king sized bed frame with the mattress.. you name it.

I sent her a couple of messages asking when she would come back to grab the rest of her things but would never get a response. A month went by and she messaged me asking when I would send her the bond to which I responded when she collected all her things. She refused and said I could just throw away everything. She blew up my phone constantly calling and texting me. She would message me on all socials and send me emails, which I would all block. Eventually she started calling around to my work, family and other friends trying to get them to talk to me.

After about 2 months of constant harassment from her, she finally stopped.

Everything seemed great; he said he wanted something serious, we were doing couple-ish things, and I met his friends. Then, he suddenly texted saying he didn’t want to see me anymore because he didn't want to push me away. We ended things on bad terms over the phone.

We later met, made up, and decided to try again. The next day, he picked me up, but during our hangout, he said he felt disconnected and that everything he said when we made up wasn’t true. He also said he did things like asking for my Insta and going out with me because he assumed I wanted it, not because he wanted to. It felt like he was mad at me for initiating the relationship. He then yelled at me and drove me home in silence.

I tried texting him to clear the air because I knew I’d see him again and didn't want another outburst. He reiterated that he wasn’t interested in me, so I said I wasn’t interested either and just wanted things to be less tense. I was a bit harsh since he kept saying hurtful things. He left me on read.

When I saw him at the arcade a week later, he tried to apologize, but I brushed it off. We hung out in a group, and he kept initiating contact, so I assumed we were on good terms. Later, I asked if we could chat since I cut him short earlier, and he restated that he wasn’t interested and didn’t understand why I was nervous around him, implying I had bad intentions. I said I just wanted to be friends, and he agreed.

I don’t think my tone was harsh but it hurt for him to call me selfish right off the bat. He always tells me not to take offense to stuff he says bc he was “clearly jokingly” the statement I made about the mic was not serious or forcing him to get one I’m not sure why it came off like that. 

I tried to ask but he just stopped talking. Later he said it was bc he had to focus on the game but eventually our argument continued over text where he said I should know that he wouldn’t talk during a game and that not obvious to me. I wish he just said can we talk about this later. 

Later he called me manipulative for saying “you shouldn’t have called me selfish right off the bat” he said I’m invalidating his feeling. Also I’m not trying to solve the issue but focusing on how I got hurt and so I’m just looking for emotional validation

We're broke from buying a house so it's a town hall wedding with only our parents, stepparents, siblings and their significant others. The thing is I'm not inviting my mom (70F). She is undiagnosed bipolar and being raised by her was hard. She would switch from being so loving and fun to abusive and neglectful when she was in a bad phase. After my parents got divorced five years ago I tried hard to take care of her when she got diagnosed with cancer (she is now cancer-free) but she just picked fights and pushed me further and further away until I went no contact. She has spent the last few years telling anyone who would listen how awful I am, practically destroying my relationship with anyone on her side of the family. 

So when it came to time to organise my little wedding I decided not to invite her. But now I'm starting to be criticised by family members and friends to reconsider inviting her.  Like ""she would probably come and it would be fine, do you want her to feel left out?"" And it made me think I am asshole for not inviting my own mother, who did love and raise me to the best of her ability, to my wedding. I'm just worried she will derail the event, or that seeing her again after so many years would make me unnecessarily emotional on what would otherwise be a nice, low-key day. I am also pretty sure she would just ignore the invite and not come, based on past experiences with her. So, am I an asshole for not even inviting her?

103,1el8vyr,"AITAH for ""ruining"" my exes life?","I'll have to give you some background for this one. Basically, I've (F17) been with him (M17) for a few months now, probably 5 or 6. When I first met him, he was super shy and sweet. But over the course of our relationship, he got increasingly jealous of me for some reason? I tend to do pretty well in school (we go to a boarding school), and fairly popular, whereas my ex never really was. So I think he grew to be resentful towards me since I'm doing a lot with my life. Anyway, his behavior started to change a lot and he would constantly get angry and make a lot of really bad decisions, and he started treating me awfully. He'd never hit me or anything, but I stopped feeling safe around him. I told him we'd have to break up one day when we were together. From what I remember, he didn't seem THAT concerned and just kinda shrugged it off? I was pretty hurt because I felt like our relationship meant nothing to him. We broke up around month or two ago I think. I spent a lot of time crying the first week, but honestly I was getting over it fairly quickly and doing a lot better (I have good, supportive friends). That wasn't the same for my ex.

His behavior has changed a lot. We both have been doing summer school, and when I saw him again for the first time after our breakup, he looked really different. He dyed his hair PURPLE and started tying it up, which he's always said he didn't like before. I thought it was hilarious at first and started calling him emo. He also started devoting himself to his studies and being awful to everyone else in our class. Like I said before, he was a shy kid so no one really knew him, but now everyone hates him. One of the more popular guys in our class started totally clowning my ex, and everyone makes it clear how disliked he is. It's definitely his own fault for that, but I can't help but feel bad since I know he's had social anxiety. His parents died when he was a lot younger, so his grandparents sent him to boarding school. His older sister is one of my best friends (she's in college so she didnt know about any of this at first), and when I told her about what was going on, she got upset with ME for causing this and finding it funny. Also I will add, I'm bisexual so when I started getting close with my ex's sister, I think he believed I liked her instead of him and that's one of the things that made him resent me.

It's gotten to the point where both my ex and my best friend are blaming me for ""ruining"" his life, when I feel like he did that himself. My friend told me that her brother (my ex) was so obsessed with me, and I was his whole world before we broke up. I will admit, I do feel bad for him since honestly my feelings haven't changed all that much. I can see me being a bit of TAH because of how I responded to seeing him start spiraling.

106,1el8fr2,WIBTA for not paying my dad back for a parent plus loan?,"my (25f) dad (50s, bpd, he claims former narcissist) recently told me that I will be responsible for paying him back for a parent plus loan he took out for me. my parents took one out for me with the agreement I’d graduate, pay all the loans taken out in my name, and that if I did that - they would pay the parent plus loan back. 

In the years since, I have upheld my part of the agreement however, my parents divorced and my dad went on to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder and really struggled with wanting to be alive for a few years, he wound up losing his job and was unemployed for several months. He’s since gotten two jobs and is back on his feet, however, he cannot afford (he says) to continue paying for this loan. 

Candidly, i can’t either without jeopardizing my finances. I work full time after having a mental breakdown in my past career, and as is half of my income goes towards my bills (car payment, car insurance, credit card, student loan, phone, etc). Starting this month, I also will be responsible for my own health insurance and I am saving for an upcoming medical procedure (apx 3000). 

Recently I tried to tell him I could pay part of it but I wasn’t sure the exact amount until I selected my health insurance. I have several health issues, and don’t view having no insurance as an option due to the nature of my diseases. When I tried to tell him, he began crying and I immediately told him I could cover it all and I’d figure it out. 

Hindsight, I can’t afford health insurance and this loan. I’m trying to find a second job and even better jobs with benefits but the market moves so slowly and I’m running out of time. I fear if I don’t pay the loan he will remove himself from this earth or he’ll go to my mom for financial help. I’m also not keen on the idea of not having health insurance, but with his loan payment I cannot afford it. 

A few things to note, my dad and I have a one sided complex relationship- he doesn’t acknowledge how I feel, nor listen when I address problems or set boundaries. He doesn’t contact me unless he needs me, he doesn’t ask how I am or what’s going on in my life. In fact, he told me the day after a traumatic medical procedure that I now owe him for this loan. My therapist wants me to stay firm on the boundaries I’ve been setting, however, I am afraid he will cease to exist if I can’t help him. He also doesn’t view it as help- he views it as my obligation since the loans were taken out on my behalf. Lastly, when I agreed to pay it in full he stopped crying and confirmed I knew the amount and when to send it to him.

Please ask questions if needed, I did my best to be concise but there’s a lot of background. I also am hesitant to share, as I don’t want this to get back to him.

109,1el861j,AITA for refunding someone for something they bought and re-selling it for more?,"Today my boyfriend and I were talking about how we needed some extra money (me being a college student in debt, and he living alone supporting two cats and himself) and decided to sell a pair of jeans on depop. now let me tell you, these are some expensive jeans, and we weren't quite sure of the price of the exact pair so we set the price to be about $190. 

Now I didn't know this at first, but I accidentally listed 2 separate sizes of the jeans on depop when trying to put the measurements in. They were male pants and there was no option for Length and Width so I assumed I should put in one as 32"" and one as 34"" (not realizing I was putting two separate sizes and thought I was just doing one).

About 20 minutes pass and I go to check my phone and it has been completely blown up with notifications from depop so my bf and I got immediately excited. I log onto the app and see loads of lower offers (I put in the description of the post to send offers since we didn't know what to expect) and then I watch it get sold... twice. My heart dropped, I was so confused wondering if depop made an error or glitched out and it accidentally sold twice, but I later came to realize my issue when I thought back about the sizing.

The way I figured it out was I started to go through the process of listing an item, and I went to look at the sizing to see if it was actually my fault, and it was when it showed it was one quantity each size.

Immediately, I knew it would only be the right thing to give complete refunds to both customers, let them in on what was going on, and apologize for the mix up.

Now here's where it gets a little messy.

After the process of refunding, I notice another message that I didn't see previously of someone saying they would pay $200, then refuted that and said $240 if I would ship it that day. This of course caught my boyfriend and I's interest, and they were his pants so I asked him what we should do, and he said we should absolutely do it, and I without hesitation agreed. Wouldn't you??

We contacted the person with the offer, re-listed it for them, packaged it up (even went out to buy tape) and shipped it out, and we were super excited (one that my boyfriend could pay his rent, and two because we had no idea this was going to happen and we just expected a bunch of lowball offers). 

Later in the day, I get home and go on depop to see if any of my other things sold, when I see it.

A terrible review from one of the people I refunded, calling me a greedy seller, saying that I refunded them just to sell it for more. WHILE THAT IS NOT COMPLETELY INCORRECT

I did genuinely mess up, own up to them, and let them know the ACTUAL FACTUAL SITUATION, but now it's forever ingrained into my account that I'm a greedy seller. Sure I maybe could've went across it in a better manner, but also it wasn't fair to give it to either of the customers when there was only one pair to begin with.

Now here's where it gets a little messy.

After the process of refunding, I notice another message that I didn't see previously of someone saying they would pay $200, then refuted that and said $240 if I would ship it that day. This of course caught my boyfriend and I's interest, and they were his pants so I asked him what we should do, and he said we should absolutely do it, and I without hesitation agreed. Wouldn't you??

We contacted the person with the offer, re-listed it for them, packaged it up (even went out to buy tape) and shipped it out, and we were super excited (one that my boyfriend could pay his rent, and two because we had no idea this was going to happen and we just expected a bunch of lowball offers). 

Later in the day, I get home and go on depop to see if any of my other things sold, when I see it.

A terrible review from one of the people I refunded, calling me a greedy seller, saying that I refunded them just to sell it for more. WHILE THAT IS NOT COMPLETELY INCORRECT

I did genuinely mess up, own up to them, and let them know the ACTUAL FACTUAL SITUATION, but now it's forever ingrained into my account that I'm a greedy seller. Sure I maybe could've went across it in a better manner, but also it wasn't fair to give it to either of the customers when there was only one pair to begin with.

111,1el7y4v,AITA for telling my roommate to deal with his own dog?,"TW: pregnancy loss

Some context:
My husband (30m) and I (30f) have been TTC for 4 years now, including two rounds of IVF, both of which resulted in miscarriages, the first was missed and we didn’t find out until 11w (embryo measured 8w+4), and I passed the pregnancy at home at what would have been 12 weeks. The second, we caught the heart stop beating at 9 weeks, and confirmed the MC the following week, and I had a D&C at 10 weeks. That D&C was 3 days ago.

Yesterday, my roommate was out with his girlfriend (they’re “trying to work things out” for the 6th time in the 2 years we’ve lived together). There was a thunderstorm, and his 70lb dog started freaking out. I was trying to sleep through my pain, so my husband went downstairs to comfort the dog. After about a half hour, he came back up, because the dog wasn’t settling & trying to climb all over him and he wasn’t dealing with that. The dog started scratching on the guest bedroom door, which was closed for some reason. I woke up and thought he trapped in there, so before painfully getting up, I texted my roommate asking if dog was locked in there for some reason. While waiting for a response, I did get up and saw he was actually locked out of the room, and corrected myself in the text. Roommate said “that’s weird, maybe he thinks we’re in there.” 

I opened the room and the dog sniffed around, and then I spent a half hour trying to get him into my roommates room, because usually during a thunderstorm, if we put him in there with the curtains closed, and a blanket over him, he’ll settle and fall asleep. In the process of trying to coax him into the room, he jumped on me twice, the second time sent me spiraling into pain, and I’ll admit I was frustrated when I texted my roommate, but I don’t think I was out of line. Adding the text conversation to the comments, which started a whole argument, my main point being his dog is not our responsibility, and his main points being I have no heart for not wanting to constantly care for his dog, and how dare I disrespect him by telling him he needs to deal with his own dog. 

TLDR: I told my roommate I wasn’t dealing with his 70lb dog 2 days after I had surgery, and he called me disrespectful, bitchy, and said I have no heart. AITA? ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-06,"AITA for telling my roommate to deal with his own dog? TW: pregnancy loss

112,1el7xe8,AITA if I leave my mom out of my wedding?,"Hi friends,

I recently got engaged to the man of my dreams and we’re planning on getting married next summer. 
I’m not sure where to start but my dad is the most loving, amazing dad and my mom is a narcissistic mother. She’s been an absolute nightmare especially over the last 6 years and I ended our relationship formally a year and a half ago but I converse with her to “keep the peace” during family events so my dad doesn’t get uncomfortable. The only negative thing I can say about my dad is that as much as he’s tried to keep her in check, he does somewhat enable her as she continues to get away with everything. I could list countless examples of how she’s been a nut job of a person but for the sake of this post, just picture the most selfish, abusive, psychopathic mother you can imagine.

Fast forward to now, I think she genuinely assumes she’s automatically invited to the wedding lol. For more context, she’s always been jealous of my sister and I, even last month she was telling my brother that we’re princesses and she’s the servant (I haven’t lived at home for over a year and I raised my siblings more than her/did my own laundry and meals by the time I was 13 but anyways). She’s always had an issue being happy for other people and even caused scenes at my cousin’s wedding two years ago. I clearly know that it’s a bad idea to have her there, but there’s a part of me deep down that wonders if she could behave for one day and be normal. I also, as much as she’s been a trainwreck of a parent, have some sort of empathy for her as a person and I know this is a huge moment that she’ll be missing out on. 

To make things crazier, she recently gambled away over $40k in high interest loans while my dad is the breadwinner in the family. This also means that my partner and I have been working nonstop as we know we’ll be funding the wedding solo, and to be honest I don’t expect my dad to pitch in either way, but I also feel like basically paying for her to be somewhere that we had to entirely earn on our own because of her would be another thing that would set me off.

At the end of the day, I know some parents don’t get it right and I’m sure when I have kids of my own I may have more empathy for my mom, so I just wanted to know if it really is an AH thing to exclude a parent from your wedding. I haven’t spoken to my dad about this yet because as crazy as she is I think he’s in denial about how bad things are and I know he’ll probably be upset if she’s left out.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-06,"AITA if I leave my mom out of my wedding?

Our children are best friends and we are also neighbors. We have game nights and family dinners. We also established a facebook messenger chat group amongst the 4 of us. In early April my wife sent a message with our availability for our next game night. In that message she said ""our next available weekend is May 17-18"" along with an explanation of why. My birthday is May 8th. She sent a message saying "" ****'s birthday is the 8th. So that weekend, 10-11, we are thinking of going somewhere like a national park to celebrate""

Fast forward to the middle of July. They came to our home for an evening hang out. During the course of conversation a question was asked about a certain drink that was had at his wife's birthday party. Her birthday is May 9th. My wife replied with ""what party?"" Up until that point we had no knowledge of a party for her. It was a surprise party that her husband had planned for her that apparently took place on the weekend of May 10-11. I'm unsure of the specific date. Needless to say, we were both shocked and confused that we were not invited but we didn't push the issue. Her husband said it's because we were not available that weekend.

About 3 weeks later I made a joke about a 'secret party' on our FB messenger chat thread. My wife wrote this message verbatim - "" It would've been nice to have been asked. We would've gone. Didn't know shit about it though. Just saying 🤷‍♀️😓""

The husband did not receive this well at all and feels he did nothing wrong. He also mentioned that if someone informs him they are busy he feels no need to inform them of any of his plans. He stood his ground,as did my wife, and it has caused quite the rift in the friendship.

 Before that i invited one of my classmates(also kinda friend) to it

 I asked her at the start of march. She at first said ofc and all that stuff.

 Than i asked again in may- this time in messages if she was still coming (Cuz ppl can change their mind- and my parents were torturing me abt it) but she didn't answer.

Literally left me on delivered for a month

 Either way- i saw her again in june and i asked face to face if she was still coming because she didn't answer me (some say i was too insistent but my parents were killing me with questions about the 'invites' (Cuz i was supposed to do the 'party' at my dad's- Yey separated parents) 

She said that she was gonna come and that i was soooo annoying with the nonstop questions. Than said she didn't have to rlly answer me (tho i'm not sure if i was supposed to hear that as it was muttered to another classmate)

Skip time to the end of june when we had our final practical test (hair stylist) i was in the middle of my test doing mom's hair when she comes to me, hugs me from behind- says ' won't be able to come, i don't have any money and i feel baddd about it. Tho maybe i will, i'll see'

This is where i might be the asshole, i was so damn annoyed that she ignored my messages for a month- than was an ass about her answer last time and that now she was literally taking my attention from the test that i said 'yk you don't have to come. Not like anyone will notice' (yes- a little rude but i was stressed cuz i didn't wanna fail the test)

(I did say that only bcs the only person that knew her that come to my bday was another classmate. The others didn't rlly knew her. Still kinda rude of me tho)

The mf hugs me again, KISSES MY DAMN NECK .... Like what?- and leaves without saying anything else 

After the practical exam when we got outside mom called me an asshole & a b*tch for saying the comment so bluntly & probably hurting their feelings (tho she did use more- curses lol)

117,1el74le,AITA for not having a full accessible birthday party?,"I (21F) recently had a birthday in Cancun, Mexico. The original plan was to invite all of my closest friends and my mom and we stay in an all inclusive resort. I paid for all of us to have matching outfits and all of us to get our makeup and hair professionally did before our beach photo shoot. But, sadly, my aunt decided that she would come to even without an invite. I tried to oppose this idea with my mom but she said just to let her come. 

Now, I do not mean to be any type of mean to people in wheel chairs, but, it would become very daunting to have to roll her around in Mexico the entire week long trip. Which, normally, if it was a friend would be fine, but my aunt had a tendency to complain when things don’t go her way. 

This was even worse for me because this took a large gap out of my money. At this time I was only working a small job because I hadn’t got into school just yet. So, when my aunt started to ask where her outfit was and her hair makeover I had to try to nicely explain to her that if she wanted this extras that she would have to pay for them herself. Me saying this got her riled up and she started to yell at me and my mom about being cheap and “too poor to even care for family.” This did not really affect me much, but this did affect my mom devastatingly. 

I continued on with my party and one of the activities was a private club that I had booked that had full catering, music, and a bar. But, once we got there I noticed that she sat in the corner judging me the entire time. Then she proceeded to yell at our catering guests because they didn’t have any vegan options for her to eat. But, what really broke me was when she “accidentally” spilled whiskey on my 50 dollar outfit and my nearly 100 dollar hair, ruining both of them. She said that she had tripped because of how nauseated the lack of vegan food made her. I screamed at her and said that she would have to pack her bags and move out of the resort (that I paid for) that night and stay somewhere else for the 3 day remainder of the trip. I yelled at her and said that she cannot come and ruin my party just because she was too broke to even have a birthday party when she was my age. I also said that maybe she should put the weird interest that she had with me into her daughter who is in jail. This made her cry and she disappeared after I said this. My mom went after her and told me that I should have handled the situation differently and my friends said I was being a little harsh. I didn’t see her for the rest of the trip and her other sons and daughter told me to never come near them again. I don’t know how to feel about this situation, so Reddit, AITAH?

Edit: It’s not that I didn’t have the money to play for my aunt, it’s that she proceeded to call me names and say very derogatory things towards me. That’s why I didn’t pay for the dress.

Now, I do not mean to be any type of mean to people in wheel chairs, but, it would become very daunting to have to roll her around in Mexico the entire week long trip. Which, normally, if it was a friend would be fine, but my aunt had a tendency to complain when things don’t go her way. 

This was even worse for me because this took a large gap out of my money. At this time I was only working a small job because I hadn’t got into school just yet. So, when my aunt started to ask where her outfit was and her hair makeover I had to try to nicely explain to her that if she wanted this extras that she would have to pay for them herself. Me saying this got her riled up and she started to yell at me and my mom about being cheap and “too poor to even care for family.” This did not really affect me much, but this did affect my mom devastatingly. 

I continued on with my party and one of the activities was a private club that I had booked that had full catering, music, and a bar. But, once we got there I noticed that she sat in the corner judging me the entire time. Then she proceeded to yell at our catering guests because they didn’t have any vegan options for her to eat. But, what really broke me was when she “accidentally” spilled whiskey on my 50 dollar outfit and my nearly 100 dollar hair, ruining both of them. She said that she had tripped because of how nauseated the lack of vegan food made her. I screamed at her and said that she would have to pack her bags and move out of the resort (that I paid for) that night and stay somewhere else for the 3 day remainder of the trip. I yelled at her and said that she cannot come and ruin my party just because she was too broke to even have a birthday party when she was my age. I also said that maybe she should put the weird interest that she had with me into her daughter who is in jail. This made her cry and she disappeared after I said this. My mom went after her and told me that I should have handled the situation differently and my friends said I was being a little harsh. I didn’t see her for the rest of the trip and her other sons and daughter told me to never come near them again. I don’t know how to feel about this situation, so Reddit, AITAH?

Edit: It’s not that I didn’t have the money to play for my aunt, it’s that she proceeded to call me names and say very derogatory things towards me. That’s why I didn’t pay for the dress. ",1.0,0.022868523,0,0
118,1el6woh,AITA for expecting an apology from my sister for not showing up to my event,"I was hosting a musical project that was months in the making. I was transcribing music, setting up the venue and designing promotion for months. My sister and I live together so I know she is available at the moment. I got a little too ambitious near the time of the performance and I asked my sister if she could grab a long USB extension cord from the store to hook up a live stream.

She tells me she went tooth and nail to find this cord, stopping by three different stores. She tried calling me to update me on why she could not find it. I was unable to answer my phone because of two things. My phone was currently being used as a method to have people pay at the door.  As well as, the event had already started and I was immediately playing music. I was thankfully able to send an updated text to let her know she did not have to worry about it.

I sent that text around 7:30 PM. My event goes til 10 PM, and she did not show up. She did not tell she was not going to go to my event and she was not busy during the day. When I get home, I apologized to her about sending her on a last-minute fetch quest that stressed her out. She proceed to take my apology and act like I was not suppose to expect her to be there. She has shilled this event just as hard as I have to people. I felt like she was deliberately not apologizing because she went to extreme lengths earlier.

I gave it two days and went to tell her that I was upset that she wasn't at my show. She proceeded to give excuses such as, she doesn't participate in the activity the music facilitated, and that she did not want to be in a loud environment. All while purposely not trying to sound apologetic in any way.

This is now incredibly awkward because I know for a fact she had every reason to be there. She invited a lot of her friends and people that she knew (who she knew arrived as well). There were spots at the venue where you could be away from the noise. Everyone I know was there to support me, whether or not they participated in the musical activity. I know I shouldn't have put her in a stressful situation before my gig was to happen, which I immediately apologized for. But I don't think it justified not going to my event altogether, and then not feeling apologetic about it.

UPDATE: You guys were right, I was definitely being the asshole. I had a sense of overwhelming support and presence at the event that it blinded me from the fact that it wasn't that personal. I have fully cleared the air with my sister and we are now on healthy terms.

119,1el6szd,AITA for questioning my teacher about the joke he made about the accident i suffered,"Well, today me (17F) and my brother (14M) was hit by car while crossing the road to go to school.  
The driver was looking the other way as he drove straight towards me, i got hit in my ribs and fell to the ground, thank God nothing worse happened, but my principal sent me home earlier to rest because i got a few scratches and was having trouble breathing.  
  
While I was at home, my friend texted me that our physics teacher made a joke about the accident i suffered in the morning.  
  
She (and my other classmates confirmed what she said) said that a girl made a joke that she could stop a truck with the power of her mind (by the way she is eighteen years old, not 9 lol) he answered: ""if you try to do so, you will end up just like \*my name\*"" and everyone started to laugh...  
  
It is nothing bad, but when i heard he did this i got blinded by rage and sent him a text, because to me what happened was not a joke (in my country students and teachers have a less restricted relationship, so much so that we call our teacher by their names. Thats why I took the liberty of sending him a message).  
  
In the message, i told him that i didn't like what he did, hoped he understood his mistake, and that i didn't gave him the permission to make fun of me, especially in an occasion I wasn't there.  
He than answered me that he did not made fun of me, that he was giving an example of inertia and before I questioned anything i should know the what really happened.  
  
I got so angry because everyone said that his """"""example"""""" was joke intended, and it was not an example, but an addition to the girls joke.  
I, then, replied that if he said something that made everyone laugh, then it was a joke. And then I added that even if it was just an example, I didn't give him permission to use situations that happened in my life as an example for a lesson.  
  
I know it was not that big of a deal but this situation pissed me of because this teacher has been picking on me for years, and using my accident as something to laugh just made me burst with anger....

I was happy to spend that money as I have
a modest lifestyle (about 40k yearly, which is far more than most of the party including the bride make) and I budgeted, figuring the other costs would be reasonable and similar to past weddings.

Cut to 2024, he couldn’t retire so he postponed his trip so we scheduled a trip together for late 2024. 

10 days after buying the international tickets my dad “asked” if he could invite his tour guide friend to come. I said it would be weird to have three people, it wouldn’t be a father/son trip anymore and it would change/slow down the trip. He invited them anyways and bought their ticket. Come to find out this person is a 23yo sugar baby of my dad. 

After finding this out I said it was too weird, the trip changed from what I agreed to and I don’t want to do it anymore. My father doesn’t understand why I’m weirded out. We have $4500 invested in non refundable purchases, 3 tickets and 1 Airbnb.

10 days after buying the international tickets my dad “asked” if he could invite his tour guide friend to come. I said it would be weird to have three people, it wouldn’t be a father/son trip anymore and it would change/slow down the trip. He invited them anyways and bought their ticket. Come to find out this person is a 23yo sugar baby of my dad. 

After finding this out I said it was too weird, the trip changed from what I agreed to and I don’t want to do it anymore. My father doesn’t understand why I’m weirded out. We have $4500 invested in non refundable purchases, 3 tickets and 1 Airbnb. 

AITAH for walking away from the trip? I even wanna ask for my portion of the money back.

129,1el5jlk,AITA for refusing to coddle my brother and make him feel better about his crappy decisions? ,"
Long story here so hang on tight. 

I (29F) have an older brother (33M), I’ve always been the big sister in terms of responsibilities and just making better decisions in life. My brother was a very sick kid and was coddled beyond belief by my parents.

Some background info, he got busted by cops for some pretty serious shit when he was about 21 and was let off with probation and if no trouble in 7 years, his charges were cleared of public record. In that 7 years he met his ex Abby. She was fresh out of divorce, parents died, and no siblings. 

She was much more responsible than him and always picked up the slack when needed. The last 2 years he’s been the same old person who quit jobs, got caught by cops, fired, and just plain irresponsible for someone his age. 

Recently it’s come to light that he’s been physically, emotionally, and mentally abusive to Abby and she finally had enough and left him (I unfortunately was there to witness one of the incidents and yes I stood up for her and called him out.) He’s now back at our parents house and not doing good mentally. 


Here’s my dilemma… my mother is still coddling him and wanting to just act like she believes all the BS that comes out of his mouth and “let him heal and if that’s how he needs to do it then fine.” In my perspective ABSOLUTELY NOT. He needs to own up to his mistakes, be called out for his bullcrap, and not coddled. I will be there to help him through and figure his crap out to get him to a good place but I firmly believe that he needs to own up to his mistakes regardless of mental health because he’s the one who put himself in this situation. 

The last two days he’s come up with some WILD stories about his ex ( she’s doing drugs, she’s got a different man, she’s had this all planned out for months, etc.)

130,1el56gc,AITA? Or do I have a bad friend?,"
Apologies in advance, this is a bit of a TLDR since I’m bad at being concise.

To start off, I signed a two year lease with two friends on a house. One of the friends turned out to be a bit problematic but I found a way to live with it. I’ve been best friends with the other one (let’s call him John) since third grade and we’ve had our fair share of arguments but nothing detrimental. About a year into the lease, I had something urgent come up that required me to move in with my girlfriend. This caused some trouble since I couldn’t break the current lease, so I’d have to pay for two leases making it financially difficult for us. Discussing this with my roommates didn’t result in many solutions. They weren’t willing to take on a new random roommate which was completely fair since I’d probably be the same way. And taking me off the lease would financially burden them as well. Eventually I found a solution that didn’t burden them. What hurt me though was that John didn’t empathize whatsoever. In fact, he pretty much told me that my girlfriend should go live with her mom who is multiple states away. I was shocked that he would recommend this because he would never want that to happen to him.

Anyways, things settled down and we were able to move on. About a month later though, a mutual friend of ours since middle school (let’s call him Zack) got kicked out of his house by his alcoholic dad, leaving him with no car, no money, and nowhere to go. To me, this was the perfect opportunity to have him move into the old house I was still paying rent for with the two roommates. And I didn’t even mind paying the rent until he is able to get back on his feet. Unfortunately, when this was brought up to John, he became hesitant and said he can only move into the vacant room temporarily and then has to find his own place because the two roommates are comfortable with their current living situation and don’t want to mess it up. The problem is, Zack doesn’t even have credit built up so nobody will even consider him as a tenant for a while. 

I’ve talked to John since and told him that in my opinion he is letting a friend down. He got somewhat defensive about this and kept referring back to how he’s already comfortable with current arrangements and doesn’t want to change that. Am I the asshole for thinking he is being selfish and a bad friend?

134,1el4i1f,AITA for comparing my work schedule to my roommates autism and ADHD?,"
I’m a 21yr old female with a 19yr old roommate in a college town. To start things off, they are just a subletter for the summer, and they were moving from a dorm room to one of the rooms in the house I am currently living in. They do not have a license, so my roommate at the time and I agreed to help the subletter move all of their things to the house. Mind you, this was also 2 days before their lease officially even started, but we let them move in early because they had to get out of the dorms by a certain date, so my roommate slept on the couch so that the subletter could have the room. We PACKED and moved boxes and bags of things to our house with little help from the subletter. So we were already off to a poor start. 

The subletter had disclosed their autism, ADHD, and other mental health issues to me randomly one day when I was making lunch, kinda trauma-dumping, but I made a note of it. I knew the importance of clear communication. I wrote down all the chores and housekeeping items that had to be done, and was very clear with what I expected them to do. The list included things like cleaning off dishes before putting them in the dishwasher, no shoes in the house, cleaning up spills after yourself, etc.They did at first, but as the summer went on, dishes were being left out with food in them, pots filled with pasta sitting on the counter for days on end, moldy bread, you name it. 

I had asked multiple times for them to clean up after themselves, and they would tell me they would, but they did not. I am working full time this summer. Subletter does not have a job. They do anything except clean up. I have been keeping up with my duties and chores that we agreed and signed on and they have not. We got into a heated argument because they wanted to invite a MAN they met ONLINE who they had never met in person to SPEND THE NIGHT. I was not comfortable at all with that, so I shot it down fast because overnight guests had to be approved of, and I didn’t approve. Subletter starts calling me an asshole for not letting their “friend” spend the night, and how I’m constantly asking them to do things, never letting them have guests (even though I have never had a problem with other people coming over during the day) and that I’m not understanding of their autism and ADHD making it difficult to do common household chores like doing the dishes. I got extremely upset and said that if I can work 40 hours a week and still do my dishes along with all the other things I do to keep the house clean, they need to grow up and just learn how to do the dishes. And also not inviting strangers over, but to me these things are fully reasonable. 

Well now I am being called ableist and a terrible person, and the subletter just isn’t listening to me at all anymore, and not responding to my texts because I’m not “respecting their boundaries” and being unreasonable. AITA?

I’m genuinely convinced that I’m being selfish here so please tell me if I’m TA.

Context: I (22F) am turning 23 in two weeks. I’m planning to have a small party with about 10 people tops, including my partner and my two best friends, Patrick (20M) and Jemima (23F).
I’ve been friends with Jemima since 2020 and Patrick since 2021, we all met for the first time through our university and at first we were all really good friends. I love them both dearly as they’ve both stuck by me through thick and thin, particularly when I went through a pretty bad time at the end of 2022. I’ve always tried to be there for them whenever they needed me.

At some point between 2022 and 2023 Jemima and Patrick started to drift apart (what I’ve heard from Jemima is that Patrick said some questionable things that she was offended by and simply decided to distance herself from him as a result). To this day, Patrick is unaware that Jemima feels this way. 

I’ve had issues in the past where friends have refused to come to my birthdays because they’ve had a problem with someone there. All I want is to be able to celebrate my birthday with my best friends and for there to not be any problems. Even if they avoid each other, I just want to see them.

I’m convinced that wanting them to come along and be uncomfortable for the sake of me is being selfish, but I don’t want to exclude either one. They’re both my friends and I want to celebrate my birthday with them both. I’m really nervous about how to proceed here.

I’ve had issues in the past where friends have refused to come to my birthdays because they’ve had a problem with someone there. All I want is to be able to celebrate my birthday with my best friends and for there to not be any problems. Even if they avoid each other, I just want to see them.

I’m convinced that wanting them to come along and be uncomfortable for the sake of me is being selfish, but I don’t want to exclude either one. They’re both my friends and I want to celebrate my birthday with them both. I’m really nervous about how to proceed here.

136,1el43hg,AITAH- For not paying for alterations on a dreaa i sold. ,"For a bit of background I got ""married in 2021 to an abusive ex. We didn't have time to soghn any papers as I got really sick and he ended up leaving me. I have kept the dress for 2yrs as the dress did have sentimental value to a degree. Worn it once for an hr tops. Decided recently I'd rather have the money for smthing else. The dress was originally 3500. Still goes for around 2000 brand new. I was selling  it for 700, there was a small stain on it so I took 100$ off. We went into a bridal store. They looked at the dress on her. And talked about alterations. 24+hrs later after the sale was complete she messaged me saying there was a tear in the tull of the dress. She is now asking for 200$. I took pictures of the train and bottom of the dress before and saw no holes. No tears and neither did the bridal store. I'm refusing to pay, because it's already a discounted price. I already took 100$ off asking price and was selling as is. 
  Here I was on the wrong when I looked at it and sent pictures I informed her that it looked to be in perfect condition. 
 To me if the bridal store didn't see anything and neither did she when she tried it on and looked at it I'm thinking maybe it she accidentally ripped it. And is trying to make me feel bad and pay. She called me a scammer/hacker. So would I be the AH for not paying to fix the dress? ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-06,"AITAH- For not paying for alterations on a dreaa i sold.

137,1el3vq5,AITA if i don’t want to share the inheritance my dad left me with my stepmom?,"Crossposting because I want as many opinions as possible. 

I could really use some advice please! 
So for some context my dad passed away a few months ago and I inherited a pretty substantial investment portfolio. It was solely shares from the company my father worked at while i was growing up. 

My mom unexpectedly passed away in 2012 and my dad remarried in 2021. We are dealing with the probate process and I’ve discovered my dad left tons of debt (which my stepmom and him racked up by taking over 10 vacations a year).

The issue is my dad never updated his will after he got married. Everything is left to me, but in the state we live in my stepmom is legally entitled to 30% of his estate. She already got the house and their joint checking account. And the investment portfolio i received passed by operation of law and is not subject to probate. however, i found out my stepmom can apply to get her elective share of that within 6 months of my dads passing. And honestly, i really don’t want to share it!! My stepmom was not around when my dad worked for the company those shares are from. My dad spent the better part of 60 years working his ass off and it just makes me mad that my stepmom comes in 5 years ago and now thinks she’s entitled to what my dad left me. 


So I want to ask the collective - am i the asshole if I sit her down and try to explain to her that I feel like what my dad left was always meant for only me??!? 

EDIT: thank you everyone for your responses and even for the answers i maybe didn’t want to hear, it gives me some clarity on what i need to do. I am speaking to lawyers all this week, what really matters is following the law and not my feelings. So thank you guys!

138,1el3p7a,WIBTA for Buying a Car my SO Likely Won't Drive?,"A little backgound:  41M, SO is 38F.  We have three kids; 15M, 10M, 4F, and a live in BIL.  My oldest is turning 16 next year and already looking forward to driving.  My goal is to give him my car and pick up something cheap but enjoyable, which his brother will inherit upon turning 16. 

I'm a big car enthusiast, but I don't want to buy something nice or too powerful,  just to pass it on to an inexperienced driver.  We have the means, but there's just other things to put our money towards.  I've settled on an early 2000s 330.  They're fairly reliable with maintenance and probably my favorite generation of BMW.  Most of my driving is a long commute to and from work, or running a combination of one or more children and/or BIL to things.  Never do I have everyone in my car.  Our van, which my wife daily drives, is the family hauler.

Here's where things start to bother me.  We've been married for 15 years and together for 17.  In that time, I've bought two cars for my primary use.  She had heavy influence on what they were, even finding my current one online and taking me to the dealership to look at it.  I wasn't thrilled, but it served it's purpose, especially when we were young and getting finances sorted.  

Anyway, we were talking this weekend and she told me I need a  small SUV.  I don't enjoy SUVs, and with the van, they seem redundant.  The cars I'm looking at would absolutely fill the needs of our family and still put a smile on my face.  Small but practical, economical and inexpensive, while looking nice.  On the other hand, she sees all sedans as impractical and uncomfortable.  I can already see her refusing to drive it or even ride in it, much as she does with my current.  She constantly complains about my car and mocks me for it, and the kids have picked up in complaining about it.
