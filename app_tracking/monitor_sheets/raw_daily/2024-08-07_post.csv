3,1emr7ez,AITA for confronting a decade-long friend after they invaded my privacy and lost my trust?? ,"For my privacy and the other party‚Äôs privacy I will **not** be disclosing our age or names, FAKE NAMES ARE USED !!

I have had a decade-long friendship with a girl who I‚Äôll call Riley. Riley and I have been friends since we met at a tennis summer camp when we were kids, we were placed on the same court and since then have been good friends until about 8 months ago. On the way home from a youth group I received an Instagram notification from our church‚Äôs youth group Instagram. There was a rally coming up in a few weeks and they had just posted the items and pricing. I sat up front next to my dad and showed her the post. When I showed her she asked if she could see my phone to look at it up close. I said yes, having lots of trust in her I thought she wouldn't snoop but I was mistaken. After about five minutes I asked for my phone back and she handed it to me with a mysterious grin. I was confused until she said, ""Who are Ryan and Hunter?"" (these are fake names) ""Ryan"" is my cousin who she has never met since he lives out of state, and ""Hunter"" is someone I used to go to school with. I knew right then that she had snooped through either my messages or my Snapchat because ""Ryan"" didn't have Instagram and ""Hunter"" doesn't attend church so there wasn't a way that either of them could've liked the post or commented that she could've seen. I responded with ""My cousin and an old friend"" to which her grin slipped off her face as she slumped back in her seat crossing her legs and looking out the window for the rest of the thirty-minute car ride, At home I opened my phone and swiped up to see my open tabs. At the time I had given her my phone, it was just Instagram that was open but now there were several other apps. I shrugged it off thinking/gaslighting myself into thinking that possibly I had opened the apps and forgotten. A few weeks went by and I had not talked to her until I couldn‚Äôt shake this feeling that she HAD snooped so I texted her and because I'm a terrible texter and hate playing the long game I immediately asked ""Hey, when I gave you my phone In the car did you snoop through it?"" it took her a day to respond which was sus to me.

Vera has recently started dating Oli 23M who is a friend of Jake and Sara‚Äôs. Oli has made a few weird comments about me- he pestered me about my weight and told me he could bench me and also asked me some weird sexual questions. When I flagged this to Vera, (I‚Äôve never even met Oli before he made those comments) she said he‚Äôs just trying to be friends. Sara and Jake said it was just his sense of humour.

Last week, me and Vera had a big fight after I overheard Vera and Oli in the shower together. We have one bathroom in the house, and my bedroom shared a wall, so I heard them having sex. They also didn‚Äôt clean the shower afterwards, and Sara stayed at her parents that week, so I ended up cleaning the shower.

I brought up this issue to Sara, who isn‚Äôt confrontational and said now that I‚Äôve brought it up to Vera she knows how I feel and won‚Äôt do it again- but she didn‚Äôt at all find it as weird as I did. Since then I have avoided Oli/Vera and kept to myself.

Backstory: I‚Äôm in the process of adopting my niece from my half sister (she‚Äôs a drug addict). My niece is two and we believe she is autistic. She needs a lot of help and gets frustrated/loud very often. 

I went to therapy for the first time since I‚Äôve been back yesterday. My therapist suggested an intensive outpatient program where I meet three times a week.

8,1emquz1,AITA for leaving after my friend lied to me about shoplifting?,"AITA for being upset that my friend shoplifted?

I‚Äôve never made a lot of friends so I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm overreacting or if this is justified.

This friend has always talked at least a little about money. When we‚Äôd go to shops she‚Äôll stare at something really intently and then suddenly leave it. I just assumed she can‚Äôt justify the price, which is completely fair because we‚Äôre both students and work part time. I‚Äôve only gone out with her 3 times and we talked here and there during university.

I (19F) was hanging out with my friend (18F) today. We went out to a cafe, she commented on the price early on and I felt bad so I said I would pay for her meal. She insisted it‚Äôs okay and I said it‚Äôs my fault so I‚Äôll pay for it and she can pay for something I get later on when we go to the mall. She agreed and we ate our meal.

While eating her meal she mentioned she had shoplifted something recently and I was surprised she was so open about it and I tried to offer cheaper alternatives to that thing. It was a makeup item, and I let her know how often sales go on.

Later on, we go into a shop, she said she wanted my help picking something out. She picks out 2 lip products and we walk around some more for a few more minutes. She says we can go now and I ask her ‚Äújust those two?‚Äù

She‚Äôs dumbfounded and says ‚Äúhuh?‚Äù

I ask ‚ÄúSo just the two lip products?‚Äù

She says she didn‚Äôt want them even after I ask if she picked them up, she says no.

We walk out and after a few minutes of walking she turns to me and pulls out the lip product. Since I helped her pick the shade, it was the same shade as mine. She smiles and says ‚Äútwinsies‚Äù.

I tell her politely that I won‚Äôt scold her or anything but I ask that she please not do that when I‚Äôm around because I don‚Äôt want to be held responsible for her actions. Especially if it goes bad.

Soon after, I head home, but the vibes are just off and I think she could tell I was a little uneasy and uncomfortable. Anyway I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm TA because of how quickly I went home after the incident. I just became really uncomfortable because the total was like 10 dollars max, and if anything went wrong and I was involved, it could potentially ruin my upcoming police check that I have to do for my degree.

I even took her to the most affordable brand I know that I use and love. I get that she lied to me because there was no alternative. But in an ideal world, I wish she hadn‚Äôt shoplifted in my presence anyway, even if it‚Äôs a small total and she‚Äôs done it before. Not to mention, I have the same product she shoplifted in my purse, since I recommended her something I use and love. It would‚Äôve looked suspicious as hell, and the barcodes have fallen off them because I use them so often.

This friend has always talked at least a little about money. When we‚Äôd go to shops she‚Äôll stare at something really intently and then suddenly leave it. I just assumed she can‚Äôt justify the price, which is completely fair because we‚Äôre both students and work part time. I‚Äôve only gone out with her 3 times and we talked here and there during university.

I (19F) was hanging out with my friend (18F) today. We went out to a cafe, she commented on the price early on and I felt bad so I said I would pay for her meal. She insisted it‚Äôs okay and I said it‚Äôs my fault so I‚Äôll pay for it and she can pay for something I get later on when we go to the mall. She agreed and we ate our meal.

While eating her meal she mentioned she had shoplifted something recently and I was surprised she was so open about it and I tried to offer cheaper alternatives to that thing. It was a makeup item, and I let her know how often sales go on.

Later on, we go into a shop, she said she wanted my help picking something out. She picks out 2 lip products and we walk around some more for a few more minutes. She says we can go now and I ask her ‚Äújust those two?‚Äù

She‚Äôs dumbfounded and says ‚Äúhuh?‚Äù

I ask ‚ÄúSo just the two lip products?‚Äù

She says she didn‚Äôt want them even after I ask if she picked them up, she says no.

We walk out and after a few minutes of walking she turns to me and pulls out the lip product. Since I helped her pick the shade, it was the same shade as mine. She smiles and says ‚Äútwinsies‚Äù.

I tell her politely that I won‚Äôt scold her or anything but I ask that she please not do that when I‚Äôm around because I don‚Äôt want to be held responsible for her actions. Especially if it goes bad.

Soon after, I head home, but the vibes are just off and I think she could tell I was a little uneasy and uncomfortable. Anyway I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm TA because of how quickly I went home after the incident. I just became really uncomfortable because the total was like 10 dollars max, and if anything went wrong and I was involved, it could potentially ruin my upcoming police check that I have to do for my degree.

I even took her to the most affordable brand I know that I use and love. I get that she lied to me because there was no alternative. But in an ideal world, I wish she hadn‚Äôt shoplifted in my presence anyway, even if it‚Äôs a small total and she‚Äôs done it before. Not to mention, I have the same product she shoplifted in my purse, since I recommended her something I use and love. It would‚Äôve looked suspicious as hell, and the barcodes have fallen off them because I use them so often.

12,1emp6kh,AITA For getting better grades then my friends and blaming it on their lack of effort?,"Ever since I was young I've always been academically successful. Even all the way back in year 6 (for all the Americans this is around ages 10-11) my teachers has told me that they believe that I will go far in life. This carried on into secondary school (ages 11-16) where I consistently achieved the high grades and eventually the highest grade possible.

I've always been proud about my accomplishments and of course due to having such high grades I've always had to work very hard for the good grades I get. However, every single time we get test results, or school reports I am instantly bereded by my friends for having better grades than them. This also includes my twin sister. They always without fail become angry towards me.

I don't want to sound egotistical but I do work harder than my friends and my sister. Neither do as much work and revision as I do. I do have proof of this you can believe me or not but every time I say that I'm revising or doing school work they're so quick to call me a neek (the American equivalent would be nerd I guess). They belittle me for working hard as its 'just school'.

Yet in spite of this, they are so quick to literally bully me when I get higher grades. It got to a point where I stopped working as hard and purposefully started creating lower quality work just to get their comments to stop. I now instead of feeling proud about my high grades, it feels like a burden as I know it will just spark an argument.

Also I'd like to point out that they are the ones that ask me about my grades, therefore its like an extra stab to the heart when they get angry as they are the ones to ask.

All of this combined did result in me having an argument with both my friend and my sister, saying that it is not my fault that i work hard for my grades and that they don't. I also said that maybe if they cared more and put in effort they actually do well. Both stormed out of the argument.

My friend thinks im the asshole because she believes that i don't work hard for my grades and that i get them easily, and that i always gloat about it.

I went to get it unlocked from a staff and  it was a woman who had keys in her pocket. 

She gave me a huge attitude when I asked her to walk two feet over to unlock my locker. She kept making different angry sounds while walking over to my locker. I thought this was really weird because it didn‚Äôt seem like a big deal. I went to rant about it with my fianc√©e who was on her side. 

He said she shouldn‚Äôt have to unlock my locker because I chose to not lock it like I‚Äôm supposed to.

He said she shouldn‚Äôt have to unlock my locker because I chose to not lock it like I‚Äôm supposed to. I told him people make mistakes and that doesn‚Äôt mean she needs to be rude about taking a key out of her pocket and unlocking a door two feet from her. AITA for ranting to my fianc√©e about this situation and not locking my locker? Is it normal to lock a locker in a locker room if you don‚Äôt care about the stuff in it? 

Edit: the lock on the locker is attached and you input a code. So if you ever forget your code you ask a staff to unlock it with a key. If my clothes were ever gone I wouldn‚Äôt care tbh because I wear clothes I don‚Äôt care about to the gym. 

TLDR:

for context: I've attended therapy sessions where I discovered my brother is the reason for some of my issues. When he was younger he attended anger management classes which didn't help that much. Mom has said to me in the past that she is at a loss of how to control him/get his behaviour in line.

2 days ago my (M early 20s') brother (mid 20's) went and brought a present for our mom. I found it online and we decided to get it. The plan was for me to go & buy it then have him transfer money, but something came up last minute so l couldn't and I asked him to. I was in a rush to get ready to go out and was waiting to hear what he got (there is a few different models at different prices). He sent me a picture of one, I said ‚Äúthat's good"" at 5pm. The reason I didn't send money then was bc A. didn't know his bank details & B. was unsure if he was going to get anything else. The next day at  10 when I was in class I asked for how much I owed and his details & he replied straight away. I replied at midday saying I'll send it through when l'm not at uni (Monday is my busiest day & had back to back classes all day). He asked when I said ""uh like 4"" to which he asked why I couldn't do it then. I explained how I was in class and I couldn't, which he got very angry about.

I then went to an event where I had to have my phone turned off. It ended up running late (around 6 when I thought it would be 4-4:30), and when I turned my phone on I had 10+ messages which started with please but then got more angry and 4 missed calls across 2 apps.

I paid him the money ASAP (6pm), when I was out of the event and said why I wasn't on my phone/not replying. That night I went to moms and told her what happened & turned out my brother had already complained to her so she didn't want to hear what I had to say.

20,1emo11r,AITA for making plans for this weekend?,"AITA for making plans for my goddaughters birthday on a day she is staying with us, without consulting her parents specifically?

I (M36) and my wife (F46) have a F13/14 year old goddaughter. 
This Friday she (F13, turning 14 on Sunday) is staying overnight with us, with one of her friends (F14), and my wife‚Äôs daughter (F16) from a previous relationship. They are very good friends and we often have this group of 3 for sleepovers in school holidays etc.

We planned it with Goddaughters parents (both very close friends to me and my wife) over a month ago. We arranged that we would collect the girls Friday afternoon, have the sleepover and then meet up as a group for dinner on Saturday night for her birthday. No specific time was said. 

We booked to take the group to an event they all really want to go to (Goddaughter especially)). The event is a family activity, once a year. Last year we attended as a big group and it was universally enjoyed. 
The event has a ‚Äúfinale‚Äù which starts at 3.30pm, meaning we wouldn‚Äôt likely be home until around 5. Our thinking was then 1/1.5 hour for the group to have a quick shower and change in preparation for dinner. 

Today, in our extended friends/family group chat, it was said that the birthday dinner is booked at 5.30, at a restaurant 35/45 mins away from us. 
When we normally eat out, even on weekends, table is normally booked for 6.30/6.45. 

I asked goddaughter which she‚Äôd rather do, if we went to the place she‚Äôd picked for food, we‚Äôd have to leave the event before the big finale. Her response was ‚Äúwe can eat somewhere else, I want to see the big finale‚Äù. 
I messaged my friend (goddaughter‚Äôs dad) to convey this. 

We end up speaking on the phone and he says because we didn‚Äôt discuss the fact we are attending the event, and that they decide what the schedule is and not Goddaughter, I am in the wrong and I should have talked to them specifically about such plans, I shouldn‚Äôt be making these types of plans with her as she is a child.

My view is that we had talked about the overarching plan which was the sleepover and next day and then dinner.
I said we don‚Äôt normally do dinner that early, and he replied that it had to be due to some family members attending had to leave early, and the place Goddaugter chose was busy, 5.30 was the only option. 

I said that I believe it was Goddaughers choice. She is turning 14, it‚Äôs her birthday weekend, the event is part of her birthday present from us, she should be able to choose what her priority is. He disagreed and stated the booking is made, he expects us to be there with Goddaugher.  

Current plan, with goddaughers begrudging acceptance is that we will go to the event but leave early to satisfy her parents.  She is visibility unhappy about this and doesn‚Äôt understand why her parents won‚Äôt simply let her choose somewhere else to eat at a more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù time so she can do both.  


They have not had to pay any deposit on the restaurant booking. I have pre-paid tickets to the event.

I Mason (m) have a half sister Jenny (f) and we share a dad. Me and my sister haven't really ever talked or hanged out with each other since there is a significant age gap so we never really clicked. Now on my mom's side of the family I have 3 cousins and we are closer in age and we would always hangout and the older ones did hangout with my sister but we never played as one big group growing up due to these age gaps. 

Now I was living in bliss for a while never really thinking about this and just viewing Jenny as my sister and I would only every day that, but recently me and my cousins have been talking and hanging out more. And they would help me over come mental health challenges and just treat me like a brother and my mom started calling them my sisters because of how close we are but my dad doesn't like this my guess is he finds it demeaning to my actual sister Jenny so he takes offense to it. Now l've have never said this around him cause I know he doesn't like it but I do think of them more as sisters. 

Now I was spending this past summer with them and we have been talking about my mental illness and I started to realize that Jenny has popped up on multiple occasions which was odd as I never thought that she was affecting me but as I talked to my cousins it became apparent how much her narcissistic tendencies affect all of us. Now I love my sister and I know she has some issues but we are trying to support her since she just had a kid and got a house so we would drive down there to help which is a 4 hour drive there and another four hour drive back.

22,1emnkad,AITA for suggesting to my sister to get a second opinion?,"I recently met up with my sister and nephew (9 years old). My sister said my nephew was still getting use to a bionator, I had no idea what that meant. Turns out, I guess picture a top and bottom retainer that is stuck together that he constantly has to lightly bite on to hold it in place. Apparently it is mainly to bring his jaw forward and correct a bite.

Throughout the day he was constantly trying to talk through it, I guess picture trying to talk while bitting down on something. My sister said he is working on talking like a ventriloquist. While talking you can hear him constantly sucking down saliva. He seems absolutely miserable. After dinner she told him to put it back in his mouth and he refused and asked for just a few more minutes and they both went at it for a bit, and then he put it back in.

Apparently it is mainly to bring his jaw forward and correct a bite.

Throughout the day he was constantly trying to talk through it, I guess picture trying to talk while bitting down on something. My sister said he is working on talking like a ventriloquist. While talking you can hear him constantly sucking down saliva. He seems absolutely miserable. After dinner she told him to put it back in his mouth and he refused and asked for just a few more minutes and they both went at it for a bit, and then he put it back in.

25,1emn0qu,AITA for sending my GF a news article on health?,"Back story for context. Since I (27M) have been with my (24F) GF, approximately 4 years, she has had tachycardia and can become faint without warning. She's was once even hospitalised when she fainted and had a 'fit like' episode. The doctors have never diagnosed her with anything and have brushed it off as stress related.

Today on my lunch break I was reading an article about Daisy Ridley revealing she has graves disease. One of the things shes dealt with is a high heart rate and anxiety. She went on to discuss how women are often mis-diagnosed and not being okay is normalised. I found the article interesting and sent a link to it directly, with no context or pre warning, to my GF.

After she finishes work she messaged me asking why I sent it to which I replied that Daisy had some of the symptoms she has. She went quiet and when prompted told me it's not a good idea to send her things like this without properly thinking about it.

When we both got home we discussed it in person where she called me insensitive for sending her the article. At this point I got frustrated and question how it was insensitive. She told me she doesn't want to be compared to someone else as they don't have the same experiences as her. I argued that I wasn't making a direct comparison and that the part of the article that I was thinking about was how not feeling okay is normalised for women. She said I was insensitive and defensive to which I lost it and shouted.

I asked if she had health anxiety to which she responded saying I was trying to label her with another issue.

She left the house and I cooled off alone.

Help me Reddit, was I the asshole for sending this article with no context?

UPDATE:

Thanks to everyone who's commented. Just wanted to give a short update on what was discussed further with my GF, give further context and answer some questions.

I have short term memory retention issues which is why I sent the article to my GF at the time on my lunch, if I didn't I would've completely forgotten by the time I'd finished eating! In hindsight I should've added it to a to do list and brought it up later when we're together. My partner and I work at the same plant, with the same shift patterns and she has no phone signal when at work so I thought she'd only pick up the link when she was with me and we could talk it through. As it happens she worked late and opened it while I was out.

To those who are asking, the topic of her symptoms is very rarely discussed between us. She hasn't had a bad episode for a long time (year/s). She hasnt attended the doctors in the last three years for the issue. The last time, that I remember at least, was when she fainted while we were in the shower together and went to hospital in an ambulance. 

We talked further last night after emotions had died down. I apologised for shouting and acknowledged how while I wouldn't care at all if someone had sent me an article she does and I will act differently should a similar situation arise again.

My GF's dad is ill at the moment (diagnosed with cancer in the last 4 weeks), she explained that ATM while he's ill she doesn't want to hear and deal with her health. I appreciate her dad's situation could compound any anxieties and again I'll keep this in mind.

I do feel though that in general over the years there's been an adversion to seeing anyone and seeking an explanation for the cause. A number of doctors visit happened after she fainted but there's not been much proactive efforts to find out whats going on. This is yet another reason why I sent the article because it had tones of don't just accept being not 100% okay because it's your normal.

She set firm boundaries last night that she doesn't like anyone, including me, commenting on her health or how she's acting. For example, last night, I said shes under added stress because of her dad's situation and that can/is causing her to act differently and she said she didn't like that I was deciding that her dad's situation was the reasoning while she was acting different. I can see her line of thinking but I was more trying to say I acknowledge it's tough and if you act differently there's valid reasoning behind that.

We left it that I know she doesn't want to discuss her health ATM and I need to be careful how I communicate with her on the topic.

27,1emmj09,AITA over a pet argument ,"AITA over a pet argument 

Hey everyone. So just want to check on some moral ground stuff here. 
I live in a residential neighborhood with my mom and have 2 dogs, a Jack Russel and a Rottweiler. We have always had big dogs for security reasons. Our yard surrounds the whole house and we have 2 gates, one at the top by the garages and another at the bottom. Since we have a large dog we are very careful with him. When people are in the street we are both very aware of this when we take our cars out and bring them in, making sure people aren't around and if they are, either put him away behind a gated section or waiting for those people to walk by. He does go crazy at the gate, barking and jumping but he can't jump over the wall which is about 1.6m high. He has never bitten anyone and people do give our side of the street a wide berth when walking by, because he does go a bit crazy at the gate.

So recently while we were both at work, a parrot unfortunately ended up in our yard. We found the body but with no ideas who's it was, we put the body in a box and disposing of it. Both myself and my mom were pretty upset about it but what could we do at this point.

So tonight, the police came around to the house with a lady who's parrot it clearly was. She was very upset and showed me pictures of the parrot in the Rottweilers mouth. She had clearly been at the gate amd taken the pictures of the parrot in his mouth.

Anyway, she and the police both now claim that our dog is a vicious animal, that other people they know have said he is vicious as well and that we need to have signs up (we have a sign at the main gate warning people about the dog), a net across our gates and that we must lock him away in the middle of our yard. She has reported us to the SPCA apparently and they have been to the house (unknown to us) and have apparently agreed that he is a vicious animal.

I apologized for the loss of her parrot, said we would put up another sign if so needed but i flatly refused to lock him up in the middle. The middle section has a pool and NO grass, just a stone middle section. Also, that means the entire front of the yard will be vulnerable to break in (crime is a thing here)

The lady insisted that we must lock him up and the cops said if we do not comply they will forcibly remove him and put him down. At this point I said they do not have that power, that he has never bitten a human being, that it was unlucky her parrot had ended up in our yard because across the road are 2 pitbulls, up the road are several Alsatians and the houses up the road also have large dogs, which all go crazy at their gate but apparently aren't vicious. I also said that if her parrot had landed in any of their yards he probably would have also been attacked and that they are victimising my dog and I would not be changing the way we were running things. I greeted them goodbye and then left the gate at that point. 

Someone has pointed out to me that I was being ridiculous but I don't seem to think so? Any thoughts? ",Asshole,2024-08-07,"AITA over a pet argument  AITA over a pet argument

I decided to put in the effort this time and try to join ~activities~ that could give me a semblance of a social life. As I've also always been kind of a nerd, and I never could find similar groups in my small village, I reached out to a D&D group.

31,1emm0ev,AITA for calling my dad out after he screwed over my husband?,"Throwaway acc just in case.

For background info, my dad (51m) and I (25f) have a strained relationship. He ended up going to jail, losing custody of me and vanished for 2 years. Since then, he‚Äôs been in and out of my life.

In 2017 he turned his life around, married his 3rd wife, held a regular job, saw a therapist, and acted like a decent human. He never apologized for what he did but he seemed to be turning a new leaf so I thought our relationship would level out.

His 3rd wife passed away in 2020. When she passed, I had to drive across the country to be with my dad and my husband happily joined me because he wanted to be there for my dad. Despite having no obligation, my husband came along and was really a rock for my dad. My dad moved to be closer to us after this and my husband still provided lots of support for him.

In 2023, he gets remarried. My dad and new wife have come to my husband twice to get amazing deals on new cars since my husband is a manager at a dealership. Both times, they had my husband jumping through hoops for at least a month. I get that there is a lot of back and forth when buying something so expensive, but they took it to the next level with asking for changes.

Come July, we fall on hard times which my dad knew. July 1st my dad texted my husband again saying he wanted another car. My dad went back and forth over 9 different cars, contacting husband about 100 times during the month, on and off the clock. Then, my dad decided he wanted a special edition car that is very hard to find. My husband reworked it all AGAIN based on having this car shipped in from across the country. On Wednesday, my husband let my dad know it will be a process since the vehicle has to be shipped and my dad said there was no rush, they just wanted the car by the end of the year.

Come Friday, my husband hadn't heard from my dad at all. He reached out to touch base and my dad sends a text saying, ""Well we didn't hear from you right away on Wednesday so we went and bought one elsewhere."" Now, they are entitled to buy where they please. I just think it was a dick move.

What I‚Äôm really upset about was they knew we were struggling financially and even though my husband wouldn‚Äôt have made much profit, he‚Äôd have gotten an extra bonus since it was a special edition. They knew my husband was losing time to sell to other people and still took up so much of his time. Then they bought this car elsewhere, didn't tell my husband so he wasted an extra 3 days trying to get a car here that my dad wasn't even going to purchase, and didn‚Äôt even thank him.

I became fed up with my dad after all he‚Äôs done and texted him I was disappointed he would do that to my husband after everything he‚Äôs done for them and not even say thanks. My dad was pissed and went off on me.

Everyone I talked to agrees what my dad did was wrong and that I was right to stand up for my husband. But I can't help but feel like I might have overreacted. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-07,"AITA for calling my dad out after he screwed over my husband? Throwaway acc just in case.

For background info, my dad (51m) and I (25f) have a strained relationship. He ended up going to jail, losing custody of me and vanished for 2 years. Since then, he‚Äôs been in and out of my life.

In 2017 he turned his life around, married his 3rd wife, held a regular job, saw a therapist, and acted like a decent human. He never apologized for what he did but he seemed to be turning a new leaf so I thought our relationship would level out.

I truly think I did the wise thing, because i have had almost no experience with these kinds of substances before, but i knew that being scared before using the chocolate would lead to a hellish trip.

34,1emlfdc,WIBTA if I sent a letter to someone regarding her husband‚Äôs ashes?,"It‚Äôs been 7.5 years since my ‚ÄúUncle Go‚Äù (he‚Äôs not actually related, but was an uncle-figure in my live for as long as I can remember, and Go was a nickname for his initials) passed away after a fall from a ladder resulted in traumatic brain injury.

Go had 3 sons, who were surrogate brothers to me growing up. However, since he didn‚Äôt have a daughter, I was always Go‚Äôs ‚Äúprincess‚Äù and we had a special relationship because of that. When I became a mom to a boy (the first grandchild of the bunch) Go was so excited for me, even gifting me his 3 boys‚Äô first communion suit jacket. So there is definitely a family connection, which makes me feel I have ground to stand on when it comes to the following:

My dad passed away unexpectedly in May. I hadn‚Äôt seen Go‚Äôs boys in years due to distance, but when I saw them for my dads celebration of life, they mentioned how his widow (they didn‚Äôt see her as a ‚Äùstep mom‚Äù (who lived in another state) never allowed them to be a part of his funeral (they held their own) and she never asked if they would have liked to share his ashes (they would have). They all said that when he died she basically cut off all contact.

I understand grief makes people do weird shit. I‚Äôm guilty of it after my dad died, and I don‚Äôt blame her for acting before thinking. But since Go‚Äôs death, her daughter died unexpectedly in a car accident, and she has since remarried. 

I feel like she may be in a different place now than she was when Go passed away, and now that I can empathize with how the boys feel, I have considered writing her and explaining how they still feel like they haven‚Äôt gotten enough closure due to her withholding Go‚Äôs ashes, which she still has, to our best knowledge, and not allowing them to grieve in they way they needed to.

I asked my girlfriend if she would be happy to split this cost to help me out and just to treat this as the total cost of going away (we live together and split everything equally anyway). She agreed but seemed irritated at this. 

Does this make me the asshole?

44,1emjobp,AITA for screaming at my parents during vacation?,"The title makes me sound like a total asshole but please bear with me. To preface, we are East Asian, respecting your parents is a big part of our culture, so I know what I did was wrong, but I need to know if it was at least justified.

I (17M) was on vacation with my parents (55M, 52F) and brother (12M), a road trip to be precise. It was 4 days and we were on the second or third day when we were driving to the beach. We had just come back from a rope course, and there was very heavy traffic. My mom said to wait in the traffic because if we went right, there's a little town where we can get lunch. My dad wanted to go left and get out of the traffic, but we stayed in the traffic for about 10-20 minutes.

Turns out my mom was wrong and she had gotten the places mixed up. They started fighting over that. My dad was upset because he ""wasted his time"" in the traffic, and my mom was upset because she apologized and he was still ""dragging it out"". I didn't really want to get involved, but they just kept going. 

I tried to get them to stop reasonably. I spoke to both of them, tried to calm them down (we were still in a moving car btw) appropriately but the fight escalated. Eventually my mom was crying, my dad was shouting. It was hot (maybe 80-90F) and we were all tired and hungry - it definitely made things worse.

I kind of snapped and started yelling at both of them to stop. Tbf it was pissing me off because they hadn't been fighting much recently, certainly not like this, and I was really upset that they were fighting over something so stupid. I told them that, and then they both got mad at me. Then they went back to yelling at each other, and my dad decided to roll the windows down while my mom was yelling and crying. But at that point I was too pissed off to care much, so I was essentially just screaming at the both of them to stop it. I told them they were being unreasonable, it was a stupid thing to fight about, and mom already apologized so why were we still dragging this out. They kept going. My dad was mad at me for taking my mom's side, and then my mom got mad at me for raising my voice. I was really stressed out with the both of them going at each other like that.

Eventually (after I told them to shut up and stop fighting several times; not my proudest moment) they stopped. I was extra nice to my mom after because I didn't think it was her fault, but she was still mad at me. In fact she was mad at me for DAYS after the vacation. She was nice to me, don't get me wrong, but she still brings it up (this was 1-2 weeks ago) that I raised my voice at her. I feel very guilty and I know it was wrong, and I've told her I didn't mean to, but half the time I was defending her.

I enjoyed the vacation lots, but that was very much a sore spot and turned the whole day and half the next day sour. I feel like it's partially my fault but I just wish they didn't do that.

To be clear this friend has always been bad with money, but I did ask her if something had happened, in case she‚Äôs had an unexpected emergency come up! She said no, she just hadn‚Äôt managed her finances and she had been hoping her parents would lend her the money, but they refused.

I told her I would call the hotel to see if we could cancel. Which I did, and we had passed the cancellation period so it would have to be paid in full whether we go or not. So after speaking with my brother about it, I decided that I would just incur the whole cost of the hotel and just go alone. I called my friend back, and told her this.

She asked me if she could just still come since I could afford to pay it, and she could pay me back. I said no, and she got very upset with me, calling me selfish etc. I asked her then if she did come would she have money for spending and she said no she would need me to cover that too!

Something I really wanted was my home to be ""cute"". I am buying colorful pretty things, as long as they are not super above the bland colored ones are.

The thing is, ten years ago, I bought my father a üî™ set, with colorful handles and the rainbow metal. It was expensive for a child with no allowance (bought with birthday and christmas money), but he never used. They are, for the past 10 years, in the box it came in. Not even sharpened. 

I commented on it many times over the years, and his only response is that ""they're too pretty to be used"".

Monday. Nothing. 

Tuesday August 6th. Until 4pm, nothing.

One hour later she says: 

‚ÄúAs you know the past few days I've been making a huge life move by packing up all my things, saying goodbye to friends and family, and am currently driving across the country. This is why I forgot to reply to a text message in a few days.

I talked with one over zoom, she asked questions and she said she is unsure when she‚Äôd be moving so she‚Äôll let me know once she knows. This was July 14th. 


July 29th I haven‚Äôt heard anything from her since. I text her asking what day she‚Äôd be arriving here. She texts me back and says she‚Äôs ‚Äúplanning to arrive late on Tuesday Aug 6th‚Äù. 


Friday August 2nd she asks if it‚Äôs okay for her partner to stay for few days because he‚Äôs helping with the drive and move. She adds that she‚Äôs sorry she forgot to ask this earlier. I text her back: ‚ÄúYeah that‚Äôs fine, when is he flying back? (Edit)‚Äù. No response. 

Saturday August 3rd still no response. So I text her: ‚ÄúHi xxx, since I didn't hear back from you... it is fine if he is helping you with the move but just wanted to let you know that he can't stay more than 2 nights.‚Äù No response. 

Sunday. Nothing. 

Monday. Nothing. 

Tuesday August 6th. Until 4pm, nothing.

One hour later she says: 

‚ÄúAs you know the past few days I've been making a huge life move by packing up all my things, saying goodbye to friends and family, and am currently driving across the country. This is why I forgot to reply to a text message in a few days.

50,1emimvl,WIBTA if confronting my daughter and friends for ogling Olympic divers?,"Daughter (16F) is on her school's swim team. It's a small school so they are not super competitive but they try hard and have fun, I'm for it.

Our place is sort of the go-to hangout so she and a bunch of her friends/teammates were piled up here last week watching the Olympics, especially swimming and diving. They appreciate the sports but especially seemed to be enjoying gawking at the boys. I did overhear some lamenting that the male swimmers all wear jammers now but ""Thank God the divers are still in little speedos."" I heard that more than once. Lots of giggling.

Yesterday I was straightening up the rec room where our big TV is (where they had been watching) and ran across an open spiral notebook. I glanced at it (didn't know whose it was) and saw that the girls had been ranking the male divers. But not on their dives. They had lists where they were pretty much ranking their body parts. Cutest face. Best pecs. Best abs. Smallest swimsuit. Cutest belly button. Best butt. Best bulge. Biggest bulge (apparently bulges warrant two categories). And on and on.

I was really disappointed in my daughter, blatantly objectifying the guys, when I know that as a young woman that is something that they deal with themselves.

I told my wife about it expecting her to be equally as horrified, but she literally laughed it off. In fact she said ""Are you kidding? I'd give that Tom Daley a bath in the sink like a baby"" which I thought was an incredibly gross thing for a middle aged woman to say.

I had planned on really confronting my daughter about this behavior and reading her the riot act, but now I'm torn. If she and her friends are saying this about strangers, how are they behaving around the boys on her school's swimming and diving teams?

52,1emiezl,AITA for googling my colleague and messaging his bandmates?,"
I do a lot of theater here in my town, and we're producing a musical right now where I'm serving as music-director. Show opens next week, so the tension is high. I've assembled the full pit orchestra; we've had a couple rehearsals. One of them was a few days ago on Sunday. Our guitarist (I'll call him ""Mike"") was AWOL; he wasn't the only one missing, but he was the only one who hadn't notified me ahead of time. This show is very guitar-focused, so Mike not being there was an obstacle to rehearsal.

I've never worked with Mike before; don't know him. He's been to one rehearsal, and he's really good. He's a college student in town, and we've communicated entirely through Facebook messenger. I messaged ""are you coming?"" in rehearsal: no response, and no read-receipt, just a ""Delivered"" message. 

Monday, same thing; no RR. I texted a colleague who went to school with Mike to see if I could get his number, he sent me what he *thought* was Mike's #. I text; no response. I call; the phone rings 3X and goes to an automated VM (no ""Hey this is Mike"" to tell me if I've got the right number). At this point, I'm starting to worry, both from a human ""Is he okay"", and from a selfish ""do I still have a guitarist?"" Keep in mind, this show is so guitar-focused that without a guitarist we don't have an orchestra.

On Tuesday, it's Day 3 of not hearing from him, still no RR. I'm wondering if I should be frantically searching for a replacement (long odds of finding one this close to opening, especially since all the guitarists I knew were busy). So I google Mike, hoping not to find out he's been in an accident or arrested or something. I find an ad from our town bulletin board promoting a gig his band is playing in 3 weeks, and the ad lists the four members by name. So I find the other three on FB and message them, briefly explain the situation, and ask if they've seen Mike in the last 2 days.

Within 30 minutes, I get a message from Mike saying that his phone had been broken and he'd just replaced it. Didn't say why he'd missed rehearsal, but he DID say that I'd crossed a line by reaching out to ""everyone he knows"". I apologized, tried to explain myself. This was at 1pm; I went to bed without a response or receipt. 

This morning, I wake up to a message saying I've invaded his privacy, and that he's pulling out of the show. In Mike's defense, he seems to think I got these people's names from his Facebook, and he's probably wondering if I reached out to anyone else. I could understand that as a privacy violation, especially if I'd reached out to his family or girlfriend or something. I sent him a response clarifying where I got the names, saying it was public-facing, and asking him what he would've done in my position; no response yet.

54,1emib8d,AITA for refusing to drive my stepkids and their friends to their summer activities?,"I (40m) have two stepkids. My stepson is 14 and my stepdaughter is 12. I married their mom when they were 4 and 6 years old. Their parents divorced had been divorced 3 years by then. My wife's ex doesn't like me. He didn't want the divorce to stay. He tried many times to get her back. He also tried to sue for custody of my stepkids and leave the state after we got married. It's been a challenge with him. My wife and her ex have spent more time in court than I ever realized possible over custody disputes. 

Over time, with their dad's very negative attitude toward me, my stepkids started having the negative attitude toward me too. My wife in the beginning was good about stepping in and not making me the bad guy. Then she faltered. Then she would tell me to leave it to her because it would make her ex's anger worse if the kids were telling him I was parenting them.

It was an added challenge when we had two kids together who are now 6 and 4. It's messy and not healthy. So we have been in family therapy and marriage therapy because I don't feel like my wife does enough to help bring peace to the household. She'll make plans with one or both of her kids and then ask me to do it but not tell them. It pisses them off. But then she'll tell me to be careful that her ex doesn't see me with her kids other times or he'll be in their ears more and spewing more negativity.

I make time for all four kids 1:1 but my stepkids hate it and make their feelings about me clear. They also made it clear they want their parents back together and repeat many awful things their father says about me.

Marriage therapy has been a make or break thing for the last 2 months. My wife is intervening far less than before. My biggest issue is mean comments made toward our kids together. I'm a grown man so while not pleasant, I can handle it. But the kids? They don't deserve it. And the disrespect and hurtful comments have increased a lot in the last 4 or so months.

Last Thursday my wife had made plans but had also agreed with some other parents to take my stepkids and their friends to their activities. I was already supposed to have my afternoon with our two kids. But then she wanted me to do it since her ex wouldn't (court order specifies they ask each other first before non-parents). My stepkids heard her ask me and protested and said some more hurtful things and so I told my wife no. She got mad and told me I couldn't let our kids down. My stepkids yelled they weren't my kids. I told my wife that's the answer to that. I went with my bio kids as planned and when we had therapy Monday she brought it up and said I was an ass and had shown I don't care about her kids. We argued about it again yesterday and I told her it's not that I don't care, but I'm not willing to deal with the disrespect when even she can't respect me enough to step in anymore.

56,1emi3v9,AITA for not coming out to my parents? ,"I‚Äôm 19F and I started dating my gf in Oct 2023. I‚Äôm not out to anyone in my family expect my sister and cousin, and I haven‚Äôt really planned on coming out anytime soon to the rest of my family.  I‚Äôm not the closet with my parents, and I haven‚Äôt wanted to come out to them anytime soon. 

In January, my mom had a party and she invited my gf over. At the party my mom‚Äôs friend (who‚Äôs a lesbian) had told my mom that I‚Äôm dating my gf. Her friend was highly intoxicated and also had no proof that I was dating her or that I was even gay. I remember my mom having the most terrified look on her face when she was told this, but she never brought it up to me. 

Fast forward a couple months, I found out my mom had been talking behind my back to many different family members about this. This spread many rumours throughout my family about me being gay. This has put a lot of extra stress on me on top of school and work. 

Now the other day my parents spent about 10 minutes questioning me if I was gay and if I‚Äôm dating my gf. I obviously denied it because I don‚Äôt want to come out. But they just kept asking continuously. My mom also kept telling me I‚Äôm breaking her heart since I‚Äôm not telling her. In the end I just told them it was honestly none of their business and that they don‚Äôt need to know because they wouldn‚Äôt stop asking. 

After this I genuinely don‚Äôt want to ever tell them about my personal life and my sexuality. This has made me very uncomfortable around them, especially since they didn‚Äôt just ask once, they kept asking multiple times even after I said no.

I don‚Äôt have a label because I am not completely comfortable with my own sexuality and I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm bi or a lesbian. I know they would not understand this and would go on about how do I know if I do like girls then. 

So am I the asshole for not telling them my sexuality? And would I be an asshole if I just never tell them? 

TLDR: AITA for not coming out to my parents after they spent 10 mins questioning me if I‚Äôm gay or not. ",No A-holes here,2024-08-07,"AITA for not coming out to my parents?  I‚Äôm 19F and I started dating my gf in Oct 2023. I‚Äôm not out to anyone in my family expect my sister and cousin, and I haven‚Äôt really planned on coming out anytime soon to the rest of my family.  I‚Äôm not the closet with my parents, and I haven‚Äôt wanted to come out to them anytime soon. 

In January, my mom had a party and she invited my gf over. At the party my mom‚Äôs friend (who‚Äôs a lesbian) had told my mom that I‚Äôm dating my gf. Her friend was highly intoxicated and also had no proof that I was dating her or that I was even gay. I remember my mom having the most terrified look on her face when she was told this, but she never brought it up to me. 

Fast forward a couple months, I found out my mom had been talking behind my back to many different family members about this. This spread many rumours throughout my family about me being gay. This has put a lot of extra stress on me on top of school and work. 

Now the other day my parents spent about 10 minutes questioning me if I was gay and if I‚Äôm dating my gf. I obviously denied it because I don‚Äôt want to come out. But they just kept asking continuously. My mom also kept telling me I‚Äôm breaking her heart since I‚Äôm not telling her. In the end I just told them it was honestly none of their business and that they don‚Äôt need to know because they wouldn‚Äôt stop asking. 

After this I genuinely don‚Äôt want to ever tell them about my personal life and my sexuality. This has made me very uncomfortable around them, especially since they didn‚Äôt just ask once, they kept asking multiple times even after I said no. They were also asking specifics too, asking if a was a lesbian, bi, or something else. I don‚Äôt have a label because I am not completely comfortable with my own sexuality and I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm bi or a lesbian.

57,1emhufy,WIBTA if I told my sister‚Äôs boyfriend to pay my niece for throwing away a souvenir?,"My niece Stefanie (18F) is my sister‚Äôs (49F) daughter from her marriage. She divorced the dad a long time ago and has been dating Ryan (55-57?M) for about 7 years. 

A few weeks ago several of us in the family went to see a MLB game at one of the two Chicago teams. Ryan was invited, as were other SOs and friends, many of them coming. Ryan refused to go because he is a fan of the other Chicago baseball team, but when he travels he‚Äôs on a mission to visit every other MLB stadium.

At the game Stefanie bought ice cream that came in one of those mini baseball helmets with the team logo on it. She shared some of the ice cream because the souvenir hat was her primary reason to buy it.

A few days ago Ryan was at their house (he does not live with them) and he threw out the souvenir. The only reason we can think of for him to throw it away (she washed it after the game so it‚Äôs not messy) was that he doesn‚Äôt want to see things for the other team.

2) WIBTA if I say he owes her $73 instead of $8 for it? The helmet cost $8, but parking is $25 and a ticket to a game is $40, both of which would be necessary to get a replacement.

60,1emgqvd,WIBTAH if I didn't give my classmate a gift after she helped me all year?,"I'm an MFA student getting ready to head home for the summer, and I want to give gifts to some of my classmates. These classmates would be people who've workshopped my writing all year and whose work I've workshopped in return. One of those classmates is Heather, but after the way Heather has treated me these last few weeks, I'm not sure if I should give her a gift anymore. 

Heather has been workshopping with me and a group of five others outside of class since September 2023. She's very harsh in her feedback, but I found it to be very useful because sugarcoating isn't going to help me grow as a writer. She also told our group that we should be equally as honest in our feedback on her work. I've been doing so all year, making sure to be respectful, and she's never told me she had an issue with my or anyone else's feedback. However, in July, Heather dropped out of our workshop due to fatigue. This isn't the first time she's done this, but we understood and wished her well, knowing that once her turn came around for workshopping, she'd probably return. Then I heard from a mutual friend that Heather decided to leave the workshop for good, and not because of fatigue but because she felt like our group was too harsh on her work. I in particular grate on her nerves because an agent asked to see my work at a recent meeting with our cohort but didn't ask to see hers. 

Apparently, she's been speaking poorly of me to people outside our independent workshop for some time now. I don't much care what she says about me to others: I believe that my actions should speak for themselves, and people are free to like or dislike me. However, now that I'm preparing my gifts for those who helped me with my writing all year, my partner says I shouldn't give Heather a gift. He says she's not been a real friend, and that I shouldn't give her anything because I worked hard for the money to buy these gifts, and she probably won't appreciate it anyway. I'm of the opinion that, regardless of her behavior, Heather did help me for ten months, so the gift is meant to show my appreciation for her feedback, not her friendship (or lack thereof). Yet, I can't say that I'm not hurt by her treatment of me. Would I be an asshole if I didn't give her a gift?

So my father went on vacation to Las Vegas for the first time in his life last Friday at 9pm and when he left I had planned to invite some of my friends to our entertainment shed(just a shed with a bar setup in it my dad and I reno'd it ourselves last summer) so I could have friends on the property but strictly and specifically my father said I cannot have people inside our main home besides us(related to previous accident when he was on previously stated business trip). Well my friends invited their friends, who thought they'd invite their friends too. What was supposed to be 6 people tops turned into a 4 year high school reunion. At some point during the night someone must have picked the lock on our door to use the washroom and got spooked by the multiple gar we have living in our tub while their tank is overhauled.

62,1emgj1c,AITA for kicking my sister out of my wedding because she did not follow the color scheme?,"\*\*Update at the end

When I 25F was 9, my parents adopted my sister ‚ÄúJen‚Äù who was 7 at the time. Jen was thin and fearful due to being neglected. We did everything to make her feel loved. We bought her lots of toys. Everything Jen wanted, she got. When my parents asked me to move to the smaller bedroom so Jen could have my room, I was happy to. When they asked if I would let Jen pick the decorations and cake for my upcoming birthday, I agreed. I was so happy to have a sister, and I understood why my parents gave her special treatment.

Only the treatment didn‚Äôt stop. For years, every trip we went on, we had to do what Jen wanted to do. We had to eat where she wanted to eat. And she got to plan all MY birthday parties. If she didn‚Äôt get what she wanted, she threw a tantrum. I still felt loved and cared for by my parents‚Äìthey drove me to practices, bought me things, cooked meals for me, spent quality time and gave me advice, but I was always second to Jen.

As I got older, I did anything I could to leave the house. I got my first job when I was 12. I vacationed with friends instead of family. I played three different sports and did band. I took my driver‚Äôs test the DAY I turned 16 and bought a car the day after. I went to college on the other side of the country.

Now that I make good money, I do things I missed as a child. I take fancy vacations and throw elaborate parties as I please. My wedding was no exception. My fianc√©e ‚ÄúKip‚Äù and I wanted everything to be perfect. We thought it would be fun to have a color scheme. My favorite color is yellow, and his is blue, so my guests would wear yellow, his would wear blue, and mutual friends would wear green. I picked out a dress with green embroidered details, and he picked a boutonniere with green flowers.

When Jen found out about this, she was mad. I didn‚Äôt know this, but she hates yellow and it ‚Äúwashes her out.‚Äù She told me under no circumstances would she wear yellow. I shrugged and said that was fine‚ÄìI would just kick her out if she did not wear yellow.

There was no further discussion, but on my wedding day Jen came in a purple dress. I told her to leave immediately. The color scheme was perfect and she ruined it. Jen refused to leave until I threatened to call security.

The rest of the wedding went smoothly, but afterwards my parents were furious with me for kicking Jen out. I told them that I warned her she would be kicked out if she didn‚Äôt follow the color scheme, but they said they all thought it was a joke. They said it was cruel of me to kick my sister out over something so trivial. I told them this was MY wedding that I threw without their support, so I can kick out whoever I want to. Kip came rushing to defend me and even told my parents they should be ashamed of how they treated me, but over the past few days, a lot of people I‚Äôve talked to‚Äìgrandparents, aunts, uncles, friends, have been mixed. Some say they wouldn‚Äôt have even invited Jen if they were me, while others think I should have let it slide. AITA?

Edit: (contest mode is over and I can finally edit) I want to make a few things clear. 1-I figured people would assume this, but I did NOT ask my guests to dress head to toe in their assigned color. I completely understand that people might not have yellow formalwear laying around. I said to dress in only neutral colors and/or your assigned color, so someone could wear a black dress and yellow jewelry, a blacks suit and a yellow tie, etc, but no colors outside neutral or your assigned color. 3-I invited Jen because she is family, and I honestly thought she was more mature than this. I did not know she hated the color yellow when I chose the color scheme.

Update: First, thanks for all of your comments. I felt so guilty the past few days and was worried it would carry into my honeymoon, but you have helped me realize that I am not the bad guy and it is okay that I responded the way I did.

Last night my parents reached out to me and asked if all the things Kip said‚Äìabout how they should be ashamed‚Äìwere true. At that point I told them how my upbringing had impacted me, and how my wedding was supposed to make up for the parties I never had as a kid, the decisions I never got to make. For the first time, I was able to call all of the shots and make everything exactly the way I wanted it to be. I even showed them this post and how most of you responded to help reinforce what I said. My parents said they had absolutely no idea how deeply their treatment had affected me. This is somewhat fair because I never really talked to them about it, but at the same time, I feel like they should have wondered why I left home as soon as I could, never came back, and hardly ever texted/called them. They said they feel so sorry about it, and are now planning a vacation with them, myself, and Kip for next summer to make up for it. I‚Äôm trying not to get my hopes up, but at least now it looks like they‚Äôre making an effort.

As for Jen, according to my parents she really struggled to make friends in middle school and high school. I didn‚Äôt know this because I practically lived with my high school bf my sophomore/junior year of high school and then graduated early, and Jen repeated a year in elementary school due to trauma so we were 5 grades apart despite only being 2.5 years apart. My parents tried putting her in therapy, but she wouldn‚Äôt cooperate. College was a slap in the face for her when she realized the world didn‚Äôt revolve around her‚Äìshe had to live in the same 7x9‚Äô room with plaster walls and linoleum floors as everyone else. She dropped out after a year and tried getting a job, but got fired after a few months. At that point my parents realized they really f\*cked up. They told Jen she had to either go to intensive therapy or they would kick her out. According to my parents, she‚Äôs now taking classes at a community college and hoping to transfer to a four year institution. She‚Äôs doing better for the most part, though she occasionally lashes out.

I‚Äôm glad Jen is getting the help she needs and working towards a career, and excited about potentially going on a trip with my parents and husband (while also knowing they might bail). I‚Äôm open to having more of a relationship with them, but I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll ever be a super tight knit family. Some wounds are too deep. But instead of dwelling on the past, I‚Äôm looking towards my future‚Äìstarting a family with Kip, and making sure I don‚Äôt make the same mistakes my parents did.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-07,"AITA for kicking my sister out of my wedding because she did not follow the color scheme? \*\*Update at the end

For the first time, I was able to call all of the shots and make everything exactly the way I wanted it to be. I even showed them this post and how most of you responded to help reinforce what I said. My parents said they had absolutely no idea how deeply their treatment had affected me. This is somewhat fair because I never really talked to them about it, but at the same time, I feel like they should have wondered why I left home as soon as I could, never came back, and hardly ever texted/called them. They said they feel so sorry about it, and are now planning a vacation with them, myself, and Kip for next summer to make up for it. I‚Äôm trying not to get my hopes up, but at least now it looks like they‚Äôre making an effort.

As for Jen, according to my parents she really struggled to make friends in middle school and high school. I didn‚Äôt know this because I practically lived with my high school bf my sophomore/junior year of high school and then graduated early, and Jen repeated a year in elementary school due to trauma so we were 5 grades apart despite only being 2.5 years apart. My parents tried putting her in therapy, but she wouldn‚Äôt cooperate. College was a slap in the face for her when she realized the world didn‚Äôt revolve around her‚Äìshe had to live in the same 7x9‚Äô room with plaster walls and linoleum floors as everyone else. She dropped out after a year and tried getting a job, but got fired after a few months. At that point my parents realized they really f\*cked up. They told Jen she had to either go to intensive therapy or they would kick her out. According to my parents, she‚Äôs now taking classes at a community college and hoping to transfer to a four year institution. She‚Äôs doing better for the most part, though she occasionally lashes out.

I‚Äôm glad Jen is getting the help she needs and working towards a career, and excited about potentially going on a trip with my parents and husband (while also knowing they might bail). I‚Äôm open to having more of a relationship with them, but I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll ever be a super tight knit family. Some wounds are too deep. But instead of dwelling on the past, I‚Äôm looking towards my future‚Äìstarting a family with Kip, and making sure I don‚Äôt make the same mistakes my parents did.",0.0,1.0481929779052734,1,0
63,1emgh5s,AITA for pulling a little joke on my kids?,"I'm 37f, kiddos are 10f, 7m, and 5f. They've been ranting and raving about wanting to go to Great Wolf Lodge for about a year now.

They were crabby the rest of the ride and while 10f had fun at minigolf the other 2 didn't want to be there and barely participated.

66,1emg34w,AITA I told my friend he is delusional and crazy ,"My friend (31 M) called me (38 F) to share about a show he had just seen that evening. I knew he was a fan of this local artist, but a lot of the things he was saying in the conversation sounded really concerning. He was talking about her performance being transcendental and giving him his purpose in life. He talked about finally knowing what love is,, because he's in love with her. This performer isn't a celebrity. She's a local musician who plays at local events. 

1) He compares himself to the performer's spouse, and will ask ""What does he have that I don't?"" and says that her spouse ‚Äúlooks like a nobody.‚Äù

2) He's already interacted with the spouse on a few occasions (this is kinda crazy, right?)

 3 )He claims to be in love with the performer, even though they have no friendship or interactions outside of him being in the audience. He claims that she once approached him at a show, as if that were justification for all of this obsession.

4) In the past he has gone to great lengths to be in places where the performer socializes and will spend outside of his means trying to get the performer's attention. I'm talking bottles of champagne when he can't even afford Bud Lite 

5) He more or less told me currently sees living in our city as his purpose. He has considered moving back home to his parents, because he can't afford his lifestyle. He literally wants to remain in the area so that he can continue to obsess over this local musician.
 
So how might I be an asshole? Well, I told him that what was he was saying was scary, and that I was concerned about the way he was talking about this musician as though she were a god (Her show was transcendental? She give him his purpose?) It's crazy and delusional. He got mad at me and said something nasty about how ‚ÄúOne day, you might know what it's like to be in love.‚Äù Mind you, I have been married and I am in a serious relationship right now. I told him ""Fuck you, dude!""  and hung up. Maybe I reacted too strongly. He called to apologize, but not without jumping back into talking about his obsession. He's since sent me so many messages in an attempt to justify his crazy, and I don't have the bandwidth to engage because I'm dealing with a major death in my family and gearing up to travel for a funeral. I can't take on any more crazy!

71,1emfs5i,AITA for wanting to have fun at the amusement park? ,"This incident has been bugging me for months now.  I live in a family of four : my father (51 m), my mother ( 47 f), my brother (29 m), and me (15 f). Both my parents are disabled, they have been before I was born. My mother has heart issues due to the chemotherapy ( she had blood cancer) and my father was temporarily paralyzed because of the stroke. They are now both doing better and we are living a semi-normal life. I love both my parents dearly, and I respect them for all the horrible things they came through. But all of us has to be extra cautious in every day life, so their health won't worsen any further. For example, my mother must not worry or be stressed/ scared, otherwise her heart rate could go up and she'll end up in the hospital. 
Now for the issue.  In May my family went for a trip to a nearby town. It was nothing special: we just went sightseeing, ate delicious food and that's kinda it. For our last day I wanted to visit this cool big amusement park. We live in a small town, and the most fun thing we have is a Ferris wheel.So naturally, I was very excited to see and try something new for once in my life. 
That's when it happened. We saw this cool attraction, I think it's called ""The drop tower""  and my brother and I wanted to ride it. Because of my mom's heart condition she couldn't go,  so she asked someone to stay with her to help watch over our things. My dad told me that I should help my mother, while he and my brother will go and have fun at the ride. It's not a surprise request for me, as I have done it a million times before : they always ask me to ""stay and help my mother"" while they do other things . So I stayed with mom and waited for my turn at that ride. Soon my dad and brother were back, so I was ready to finally go have fun at that ride. That's when my dad stopped me. He said that they were done, so we all should be leaving. I got kinda mad. I reminded him that it was me who wanted to go here at the first place, and now we're leaving before I even got the chance to ride at least once? Then my brother screamed at me that my mother is probably tired already, so I should stop being a spoiled brat and do as my father says. At this point I was holding back tears, this whole situation was just unfair! But I didn't want to make a scandal, so I shut up and we left. 
A week after, we are already home and my dad and brother are still mad at me about that scene at the park. I didn't understand at all, I wasn't screaming or crying, or trying to make a fuss about it, but they kept saying to me and our relatives that I'm such an ungrateful daughter who doesn't care about her disabled mother. 
Months later, and they are still doing it. Did I really do something wrong? My mom has been nothing but supportive, she keeps saying that I did nothing wrong, but now I'm doubting it. 
This is my first time ever posting something on Reddit, and I'm kinda nervous. My first language isn't English so sorry for any mistakes I might have made",TL;DR,2024-08-07,"AITA for wanting to have fun at the amusement park?  This incident has been bugging me for months now.  I live in a family of four : my father (51 m), my mother ( 47 f), my brother (29 m), and me (15 f). Both my parents are disabled, they have been before I was born. My mother has heart issues due to the chemotherapy ( she had blood cancer) and my father was temporarily paralyzed because of the stroke. They are now both doing better and we are living a semi-normal life. I love both my parents dearly, and I respect them for all the horrible things they came through. But all of us has to be extra cautious in every day life, so their health won't worsen any further. For example, my mother must not worry or be stressed/ scared, otherwise her heart rate could go up and she'll end up in the hospital. 
Now for the issue.  In May my family went for a trip to a nearby town. It was nothing special: we just went sightseeing, ate delicious food and that's kinda it. For our last day I wanted to visit this cool big amusement park. We live in a small town, and the most fun thing we have is a Ferris wheel.So naturally, I was very excited to see and try something new for once in my life. 
That's when it happened. We saw this cool attraction, I think it's called ""The drop tower""  and my brother and I wanted to ride it. Because of my mom's heart condition she couldn't go,  so she asked someone to stay with her to help watch over our things. My dad told me that I should help my mother, while he and my brother will go and have fun at the ride.

72,1emflmk,AITA for calling out my husband and his parents after they tried to embarrass my stepdaughter in front of her friends?,"My husband's parents stayed with us for a few days and the other night we had an issue that resulted in my stepdaughter being upset/angry, me angry, and them and my husband angry.

I met my stepdaughter when she was 6. I started dating my husband when she was 5. We married when she was 8. I'll admit, when we first met, knowing her mom had passed, I thought I would be filling in as a mom-like or at least a second mom figure. In my heart I wanted to be her mom and for her to be my daughter. It was clear before we got married that it wouldn't happen. She was actually very resistant to being around me. I told my husband we needed therapy together before we got married because she had to be okay with things and we needed to figure out what our family dynamic would look like.

I won't bore you with unnecessary details but she didn't want to replace her mom. She was already very insecure about me being around because her parents hadn't been together when her mom died, which to her meant she was alone loving her mom. But she knew what we wanted, for her to love me and see me as another mom. It scared her. It made her sad. It made her tummy hurt, to quote my stepdaughter. Through therapy we figured out what the relationship would be like. My husband the parent, me an adult in the home, and a safe person for my stepdaughter. My husband would keep 1:1 time with my stepdaughter, we'd spend some time together naturally over time, and in the way that worked best without forcing it. My stepdaughter would call me by my first name. I'd call her my stepdaughter, not daughter. We worked it all out.

We have been good with all of that. She and I have a good relationship, she's a sweet big sister to her half siblings (and yes, we use half). It's all normal.

Then a few days ago my stepdaughter had brought friends into the house quickly. New friends. She introduced us all, introducing me by name. My MIL told her she could say more than my name. She told them I was her stepmother technically but more of a friend. Then my husband and his parents interrupted and said she should be more generous than that and I'm the only real mother she's ever had in her life and they started to say how grateful she should be to have someone like me as a mother, when she started crying and I told them to stop. That my name had been fine. They should stop pushing and trying to humiliate her. My stepdaughter told my husband she always knew he thought her mom was worthless but she doesn't. I told her to go get ready and have fun, gave her some extra cash, and then an argument broke out between me and them (husband and ILs). They felt I should appreciate the gesture of defending me. I told them it wasn't defending me, it was done to humiliate her enough into introducing me how they wanted. My husband regretted his actions afterward. I told him he'll have to do a lot to make up for it. His parents, however, feel I was cruelly unfair to them and should not have snapped at them like I did.

73,1emfapi,AITA for attempting to ban a local player who stole from my friends and I from our gaming scene?,"TL;DR: Person takes our money for merch, does not deliver, and is silent about it.

Context: A little over a year ago I bought some merch from a player in our area who is known to run a merchandise shop and has generally been reputable, along with a few friends of mine. This person we'll call Dave. (Not even close to real name or gamertag). Dave did not deliver this, but instead 4 months later sent out an email to all customers stating ""apologies for delay"". I thought cool, delays are fine, it happens. Fast forward to December 2023, I attempt to contact him to ask where our stuff is, radio silence. I get a hold of one of his friends who he then answers my questions through, all the while absolutely refusing to talk to me or my friends and using his own friends as a messenger and a shield. He had apparently genuinely been working two jobs to try to pay all the stuff off. By this point the comments are piling up on his (abandoned) twitter account asking where their stuff is, it wasn't only my friends and I. Come to find out Dave had went to another event to sell stuff after he was already behind on merch from the previous event. The previous event apparently fucked him in fees so that he could not follow through on that merch, he planned to use the next events funds to pay for the previous (It was not nearly enough as I was in the first event and still have nothing) and reset the timer on late merch. January 2024 is the last we've heard from him on his personal twitter account posting ""apologies I will get in contact with customers) to which he still has not.

Current Day: My friends and I have submitted a formal request to ban Dave from the scene in hopes it will light a fire under him to stop ignoring us. We understand that he has been trying hard (By his own words) to pay it back, but the complete lack of transparency, no timelines, no hard numbers, and a staggering refusal to face the music of his situation and admit to the public that he messed up, has caused extreme frustration on our end. The scene only knows he has been trying to fix it because I personally had to track down a friend of his to even get the slightest word from him. People are saying I'm an asshole for trying to get him banned since ""he's working on it"". My friends and I think we are justified given his astounding lack of clarity, contact, and owning up to his mistake, as well as the fact that he continued accepting orders after already being behind.

74,1emea8d,AITA for revealing my brother‚Äôs ex‚Äôs narcissistic tendencies to her new boyfriend?,"My (f 34) brother ‚ÄûZain‚Äú (m 32) has been briefly married to Amber (f 33). They met and married during COVID and separated and divorced shortly after. This woman has made my brother‚Äòs life a living hell and has displayed numerous narcissistic traits not only in their relationship, but as well in her daily conduct with friends and strangers.
Examples:
- Amber reveiled to our prarents (without being prompted) and for no apparent reason that we both drink alcohol. Which has caused trouble within his family as they are practicing muslims. It is important to highlight that by then the relationship has been going quite fine. 
- Amber asked Zain to take off his expensive looking watch before entering a seamstress shop.  She is receiving beneficial prices, as she made the seamstress believe that she‚Äòs in financial trouble (not the case!). She easily earns double if not more of the seamstress‚Äò salary. This is only one example how she uses peoples kindness for her benefit.
- When Zain decided to leave her, she spread lies among his friends and even coworkers. (Luckily this didn‚Äôt cost him his job). As well she caused him legal troubles (not only divorce proceedings!) for which he had to get a lawyer and pay a fortune. She also implicated our parents that live in another country and tried to make them believe that Zain was psychologically unstable which has caused them immense worries. Our dad has heart problems and should therefore avoid extreme stress, which Amber knows of. 

Now, we come to my actual AITA issue. I recently learned that a good friend of mine, Laura, knows Amber‚Äôs new boyfriend, Salim. He‚Äôs 4-5 years younger than her and described by Laura as ‚Äòinnocent.‚Äô Laura didn‚Äôt know about the abuse that occurred during my brother‚Äôs marriage, so after some reflection, I decided to share the whole story with her. She was shocked and plans to figure out how to speak to Salim and reveal the past abuse to him.

Should I have refrained from revealing Amber‚Äôs toxic behavior to Laura and avoided meddling in someone else‚Äôs relationship?

Additionally, I‚Äôm aware that by doing this, I‚Äôve potentially exposed myself and my brother to Amber‚Äôs attention again, which could lead to another round of issues. While I can‚Äôt predict how she might cause further harm, she has repeatedly proven to be very creative and determined in these matters.

75,1emdevk,AITA for not letting my flatmates autistic sister live with us?,"So I live with a F 21 called ‚ÄòHolly‚Äô (not her real name) who I met at university and after finishing moved in together. I‚Äôm also F 21. Holly has little sister ‚ÄòEmily‚Äô F 18 who‚Äôs autistic, and I would like you to keep in mind for this situation that I am also autistic. Recently, at Hollys work there has been a part time one month contract going, so after giving her sister the job she asked me if Emily could move in for a month. I felt a bit uncomfortable with it being a month, only because our flat is TINY and she wouldn‚Äôt be contributing to rent, bills etc. But since Holly had already given her the job I felt a bit backed into the corner and said yes. 

So she‚Äôs moved in and it‚Äôs the most awkward situation I‚Äôve ever been in. She won‚Äôt speak to me at all apart from one word every now and then. As I‚Äôm also autistic I understand autism pretty well and after having conversations with Holly, I would like to clarify her sister isn‚Äôt selective mute, she just doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me. I understand that to an extent, as after work I also like to have a chill in my room with little social interaction. But this is down to the point she won‚Äôt say hello to me. I‚Äôve tried everything, giving her space, inviting her to movie nights, or asking about her special interests and about her hobbies. She just looks at me with the white guy smile, rolls her eyes and gives me a one word answer. It‚Äôs PAINFUL. I feel a but unsure of what to do, so I‚Äôve left her to interact with me when she chooses. Everything is very awkward. 

Me and Holly were planning to live together next year too, as of yesterday this might have changed. She pulled me aside and said her sister is really liking the city and wants to move in with us next year. This wouldn‚Äôt be as bad as she would be paying her own rent but I‚Äôm just not sure I could live with her. There is no level of friendship and i just think it would be uncomfortable for everyone involved. So i politely said to Holly ‚ÄúNo I‚Äôm really sorry, I‚Äôm not sure that would be a good choice for any of us involved as me and Emily don‚Äôt really speak and I think it would be awkward. But if you want to live with Emily I understand and it‚Äôs not a problem. I‚Äôll sort my situation and live elsewhere.‚Äù - I‚Äôm not a confrontational person and get quite scared but I try and stick to facts as much as possible without upsetting anyone. 
Holly then turned around and called me an ableist and I just don‚Äôt want to live with her sister because she‚Äôs autistic. To be honest, I could not care less that she‚Äôs autistic as I‚Äôm autistic myself (which she knows) and most my friends are autistic.

During the funeral, I noticed a few ppl looking at me strangely, and later, my gf pulled me aside to tell me that the Oud I was wearing was inappropriate and overpowering for the occasion. I was confused obv as I didn‚Äôt realise the scent was still there. Worth mentioning that we were also standing very close to each other and it was a fairly small gathering.

I didn‚Äôt intentionally put on fragrance that day, but I wore the same suit I had worn to a formal ball in the weekend, where I used a pretty strong Oud.


During the funeral, I noticed a few ppl looking at me strangely, and later, my gf pulled me aside to tell me that the Oud I was wearing was inappropriate and overpowering for the occasion. I was confused obv as I didn‚Äôt realise the scent was still there. Worth mentioning that we were also standing very close to each other and it was a fairly small gathering.

79,1emammv,AITA overstepping talking to a friend's ex.,"My friend is rather promiscuous. He likes polygamy and often goes for hookups, stringing the girls he hooks up with along even though he knows that they actually want a relationship, and then breaks it off when it gets too serious. He lives in the biggest city in my country where that kind of mentality is rather common. So there is no value judgement on that from me. I am much more conservative when it comes to relations and intercourse and won't have intercourse until a little bit further along in a monogamous relation.

about 4 months ago he let me know that his relationship had ended and they split amicably. When he told me we were at a party and I was preoccupied with something else at the time. I didn't really know how to respond, but we would be meeting up the next weekend, so I figured I would talk to him about it then and ask about the details and how it made him feel. Except... it never got to that.

That next weekend he said he would be arriving later, because something came in between. something to do with his girlfriend's family. I inquired what he meant by that, since he just broke up. That's when he told me that he had a new girlfriend. he had a ""rolling start"". it soon became clear that he was unfaithful. He admitted that there was indeed ""a little bit of cheating"" going on. He stated that he talked about it with his ex and he had her approval to continue with his new girl since there didn't seem to be any future in that relationship anymore and shortly after, they broke up.

Now to where I might be the asshole.

I sent this message to his ex: ""Hey, I heard \[friend's name\] cheated on you and wanted to know what impact this has had on you. how are you doing?"". This surprised her completely, because she didn't know about any of it. She forwarded my message to him and asked ""what's your reaction to this"". After which he kept ignoring her, but he completely blew up at me. Saying that this is overstepping and it had nothing to do with me. I called him out on his lie and that this is unethical. He got even madder and said that I didn't know anything about the situation and I should have talked to him before saying anything about it. He thinks he completely hid the cheating from his ex, and believes that he hasn't betrayed her because she didn't know anything about it. Therefore it is now my fault if she feels bad about it, because I am the one that (accidentally) aired his dirty laundry.

His ex on the other hand said that with this information the situation made a whole lot more sense. She already had a suspicion that he cheated but he would never admit and kept dodging questions. She thanked me for my honesty and said that this would definitely help get over him quicker. She then apologized because she didn't want this to become a strain on my friendship with him. Although by this point he had already blocked me and left the friend group chat. AITA?

  
EDIT: Thank you for the responses. It's clear to me that i was TA here and there was no reason for me to inquire about his ex's well being regardless of my intentions.

80,1emaiu3,AITA for not being a better friend?,"My friend Jen (F25) and I (F25) have known each other since school. I went through a tough time with my parents divorce which dragged for 5 years until uni. Jen was unhappy with having to hear about the family issues (emotional abuse from mum, dad going through drug abuse, being parentified, police raids). I did see a therapist.

Jen and Becca (another close friend) told me during uni that I only shared negative things. I took on the feedback and stopped sharing any family related news. Becca, later told me she didn‚Äôt have issue with it as Jen did. She knew it was a tough time and I always reciprocated effort whenever they needed. Becca felt pressure to speak by Jen.

And I don't want to be around that. I have only ever really had girl friends and I don‚Äôt personally think that there ‚Äòweaker‚Äô then guys to a degree. So me (14m) and my ex girl best friend [rose] (14f) were best friends before this. Just before I start I'm gonna say that we were rough, like we used to pinch each other really hard and she used to pull my hair as hard as she could. I never really liked this, but she always started it and if she ever told me to stop (she never did) then I definitely would.
But to the actual story, we were at school in Australia (NSW) it was a wednesday morning and I was walking with 3 of my friends, I was playing with one of there bags (Jessica's bag) and then rose slapped me across the face (it really hurt but I don't care about that) so I did this thing that I do, (she has never once told me she does not like it and has always laughed at it.) that involves spinning her around. I have done this to her since we became close and she Has never told me to stop once. So I spun her around and she accidentally fell over. Initially, I started laughing. But after I noticed she wasn't laughing as well, I tried to help her up and ask if she was okay. She then pushed past me running to the girls bathroom. The other 2 of our friends followed her, I tried to aswell but didn't go inside, she IMMEDIATELY blocked me when she got inside the bathroom and after 5 minutes (I have gone to where we usually sit) she comes up to me and says ""give me back {gift}. We're not friends anymore."" I thought she was joking so I said
""ok"" but then she walked away. I was kinda mad she was mad because she slapped me across the face aswell. But this story does not stop here. I have not told anyone about our fight at all. Comes Thursday morning where I sit with one of my now closest friends (sabrina) apparently rose has been shit talking me really bad to everyone. She has been calling me fat and other names. This has made me really upset and has really put a toll on me. She's also bringing up things that I have done in the past with her. That she has also been doing even after our fight.

I honestly don't know what to do and I have tried talking to her but she is telling everyone that I ""shoved her to the ground and wouldn‚Äôt let her get back up‚Äù when in reality I accidentally pushed her over and tried to help her up!!
And she keeps saying that I‚Äôm an awful friend to everyone when she was my closest friend and she quite obviously like me aswell. She had NEVER shown ANY signs of not liking me, she has never told me to stop, and if she would have ever. I would have immediately. She is telling everyone about somthing that I said.

Things were a little awkward over the next 12 days. Then my other friend 'Anne'(18f) told me I need some time away from Cora.

I agreed to let her keep my phone for the duration of the trip since she said I won't be able to resist texting Cora or checking/waiting for for messages from her. Told me it's not healthy to remain fixated and I should curb this thing before it becomes an obsession. 
 
Anne texted Cora to tell her she and I were going on a trip but I didn't send Cora any text.

83,1em9kgj,AITA for telling my roommates I'm not caring for her cats?,"For context I (20f) have been rooming with my roommate (23f) for a little over a year. We recently moved into a new apartment together because we needed more space and it was easier to remain roommates while doing so. We generally have no problems living together and everything is managed cooperatively. It is worth noting that my roommate has 3 cats which she had prior to me moving in. I have no claim over the cats and if one of us moved out (which neither of us have intentions of doing) the cats would go with her.

My issue arrived when we started talking about general set up of our new apartment, and my roommate said that we'd have to get another litter box to put in my room that I would be in charge of keeping clean. I got really confused by this and asked why this needed to be implemented and my roommate said that the cats will need a place to use the bathroom if they get stuck in my room with the door closed. This does make some form of sense to me but I am super careful about checking my room for cats before I leave and making sure they don't get stuck inside. If I am inside the room the door is usually open a crack and the cats can come and go as they please. Additionally, if the door is closed for any reason while I'm in it (like for sleeping) the cats all know to scratch on the door or meow to be let out.

I told my roommate that I wasn't going to put a litter box in my room and the cats were smart enough to ask to be let out if they needed it. My main objection here is that I have pretty severe ADHD and chores are a constant problem for me since I tend to forget. I would simply not remember to maintain the litter box even if it was in my room. Moreover I have a very specific aesthetic and my room is pretty small so I don't want to sacrifice space or my style by having a large box shoved in a corner somewhere.

This escalated as my roommate kept insisting I needed a litter box in my room and me firmly denying this. Eventually it got to the point where I said that I just wouldn't allow any of the cats in my room at all and would keep my door closed 24/7 so they couldn't get in to solve the problem. My roommate agreed to this but said I'm an asshole for not just accepting the litter box and I told her that they're not my pets and therefore it's not my responsibility to maintain them.

In my defense, I have no problem helping care for the cats like refilling their food and water dishes or any other general upkeep but I think it's ridiculous to have a litter box in my room that I'd have to maintain constantly.

1) We have 4 litter boxes currently; one in the kitchen, one in the bathroom closet, one in the hall closet, and one in the laundry room.

2) my roommate does not have a litter box in her bedroom nor does she intend to put one there. 

3) I did not have a liter box in my room at the previous apartment. ",0.0,0.08239717781543732,0,1
84,1em9f5d,AITA for not paying for a painting I asked my friend to do?,"My (27f) friend, Jordan, (28f) is a wonderful artist. I love her work, so I told her that if she ever considered doing commission pieces, I wanted to be her first customer. She said okay and I sent her a picture of my dad who passed away as a reference. I wanted to give this painting to my mom as a gift. This was back in early 2018. Jordan said she would start on it when she could, but that she was busy. I just thought she did not want to do any commission work yet and just left it at that.

A few weeks after our conversation, Jordan posted on social media saying that she was open to do commission pieces and posted how she would charge for those pieces. I messaged her again and she said that she got my order and was starting the piece for me. Per her post, I assumed the piece would be around $200. She also said she was charging her clients around that much, so i should expect to pay about the same. She said she didn't want me to pay until after she was done, so I didn't.

For the last 6 years, she would post the other commission pieces she had done. When i asked about mind, she would say she's working on it but they she hasn't had the time to finish it. She often lost her job, was looking for a new place to stay, etc. I understood that times could be hard so I waited. The reason I didn't just stop asking her was because she would sometimes send me snapchats od ""sneak peaks"" of the painting so I knew she was working on it little by little.

Well, flash forward to last weekend, she finally gave it to me. It is a beautiful painting of my dad and I cried looking at it. She then told me it was $700. I was not prepared to pay that much. I told her that when she started doing commissions, she was charging her clients $200-$300. She responded saying that she realized her work was worth more, and also the cost of supplies had gone up since then, plus the amount of time spent working on it. I thought it was unfair to charge me so much given I waited years for this painting. Also within the last 6 years, I had gotten married, bought a house, and have two young children. I do not just have $700 to spare on this painting. She told me that it isn't her fault that I can't afford it and refused to give it to me until I could pay her. I told her to just keep it since I didn't not have the money for it. She called me a jerk for wasting her time on this and left.

85,1em8zrk,AITA for not helping my sister pay for a course that she couldn't pay for herself due to bank card issues? ,"My sister called me some days ago to ask if I could help her pay for an online course which she couldn't pay for due to card payment issues. She promised to give me the money once I come home from school, which may be this month but I'm not certain. It's not like I don't have the money. I do. But it's quite some amount (literally what I spend on my upkeep every month).

And it's an amount I would never spend on an online course myself at this stage of my life (well, never say never). After a lot of back and forth I finally declined to help her pay for the course and she's angry. She's of the opinion that I receive salary every month and it's not like she won't pay me back, hence I should have no issues helping her out.

Now, my sister has been very kind to me since I knew her. She's my elder sister and once paid my school fees when I was in high school. And I'd love to support her too in anyway I can. But I feel this is different for some reason. I think one of my issues with releasing that amount of money is because I feel she has an idea of how much I earn and that has led her to ask me for money.

In a way, I feel my mindset is wrong though and I should have no problem helping, especially since she didn't originally plan on asking me to pay for the course but only did so because she had card payment challenges.

**EDIT:**

**What I failed to mention is that it's not like I can't help her and even tell her not to pay back if it was within a specific price range. But the money she asked for was quite a lot. I can afford it but it's almost half of what I sometimes earn monthly. I am a freelancer by the way, so I don't even receive a fixed salary every month and neither can I always guarantee that I receive income every month, but I've been lucky so far.

86,1em8z0s,AITA for working overtime (again),"I (30,f) have a stressful job as my department is understaffed for nearly 2 years, which leads to overtime. Overtime fluctuates, so I sometimes work 42 hours per week, sometimes over 55. I work from home most days.
My Fianc√©e ‚ÄûPaul‚Äú (27,m) works part time as a developer and studies in parallel. He is quite easy-going with that. He works up to 5 hours per week and studies mostly 10 (20 in weeks when he does not work). 
As I earn a lot more we decided to split daily housework 80:20.  He mainly takes over cleaning the kitchen, floors as well as cooking on weekdays. He also shops for minor groceries. I will take over pet feeding on most days, doing grocery lists and buy food, minor cleaning tasks as well. Laundry and major cleaning tasks are done on weekend by both of us together. I will in return pay for nearly all of the rent, vacations, most groceries, pet stuff as well as high priced goods we both use. He pays for a small part of the rent, the car, gas as well as the few groceries he bring with him.

So here is where I might be the asshole. Paul has some exams this week and last week. He is very anxious about it as he does not that well due to nervousness. He asked if I could take over more tasks during his exam-time, so that he could learn more and is more relaxed (he does not work during exam time). I replied that I will help of course and that we can cook together on weekdays and I will try to clean more. So yesterday he had his second exam. I called him after and asked how it went and we talked if he would buy some items on his way home. I then said ‚ÄûI am looking forward to you getting home. I will work a little more‚Äú. I proceeded to work until he came home and shortly after my last call (10 minutes) joined him in the kitchen. I had done under a hour of overtime. 

He first did not talk much, and after I asked , he explained that he was very disappointed with me. I asked why, so Paul elaborated that he expected I would have cleaned the kitchen by now and began cooking. Due to his exam he had nothing to eat yet and was very hungry. I explained, that as he was not home yet, I decided to work a little longer as I said. I also thought we cook together like agreed. There was also some pizza from lunch left so that he could eat a quick snack. He said that one hour overtime is not a ‚Äûlittle‚Äú and that I do not support him at all like I promised. I disagreed & told him, that I did more minor cleaning last week, to which he disagreed. He explained that he felt not seen by me and that I always prioritise my work over him. I don‚Äôt think that this is true, as I do not work on weekends and always make plans for us to do something together, we have dinner every day and go to the gym.
The argument escalated and in the end we screamed at each other and burst into tears. I then proceded to cook the meal with him and cleaned the apartment for 3 hours.

87,1em8qvs,AITA for calling the police on my mentally unwell neighbour?,"I (30s, M) live in an apartment block and have had issues with my downstairs neighbor since he moved in a few years ago. Our first encounter was when he knocked on my door at 11pm, asking if I had been drilling earlier. He was upset about the noise because he suffers from PTSD due to past gun violence and has other mental health issues. He was holding an air horn in his hand and admitted that he‚Äôd press it against the ear of the person who‚Äôd been drilling as revenge. 

Since then, he‚Äôs had verbal arguments with other neighbors, a scuffle with our bin men, and has raised several complaints against apartment residents, including me, to our landlord. He‚Äôs been particularly nasty to a neighbour with a non verbal autistic child as he couldn‚Äôt stand the sounds the child makes. 

Our street has a pub at the end, attracting drug addicts and homeless alcoholics who often cause a nuisance by shouting loudly. We also have a busy restaurant so a bunch Uber Eats drivers camp outside and sometimes block the pathway with their bikes, litter, and occasionally urinate in the street.

Yesterday evening, I witnessed my neighbor harassing people on the street, specifically targeting the drug addicts and Uber Eats drivers. He was shouting, intimidating them, and even grabbed one Uber Eats driver by the shirt, dragging him to the area he had peed on.

Witnessing this all from my window, I called the police. When they arrived, he had gone back into his home. Other witnesses, including those from the restaurant and the Uber Eats drivers, gave their statements. I called the police a second time to inform them where my neighbor lived.

This led to his home being raided. The police arrived with riot shields, burst into his home, and arrested him and his wife, leaving their child alone. I believe the child was later taken to the police station to be picked up by a relative.

Now that a day has passed, I feel like I might be the asshole for calling the police. There‚Äôs a part of me that thinks I might have called them out of anger for his previous complaints against my neighbours and me, rather than genuine concern for his welfare and others‚Äô safety. My actions ultimately led to his home being raided and his daughter experiencing a traumatic event. One of the things he had shouted at the alcoholics was that he didn‚Äôt want his daughter subject to their behaviour.

I have always understood the pressures my friends face from their other relationships and have never made demands on their time. But the loneliness has been crippling at times as I also don‚Äôt have family.  But the good news is I have embraced it, taking myself off for day trips and holidays.

2 friends have become single and they have started to contact me again almost daily, trying to meet up and fill their time. But this time, I am not making myself any more available than I have been the last 18 months. As I feel used to be honest. I am sick of being their stopgap until they find a new man. But the friends are really struggling and I feel terrible for not making myself more available. 

I fear I am being unnecessarily harsh because I won‚Äôt adjust the life I have built for myself, to keep them company etc now they are single

92,1em8bav,AITA for not letting my dog be pet?,"When sitting on public transport, I (21F) had my dog on my lap and some lady with her kid tried to touch my dog without permission. I immediately held up my hand and asked her: ‚ÄúNo, please do not toch her‚Äù. 

She seemed offended and gave me dirty looks for the remainder of the commute. She did not insist on petting her, but I could feel she did not like me telling her off. She had been pointing at my dog to her child from the moment she got on the subway, so I figured she might ask to pet her at some point. 

In my defence, I have a dachshund that is rather uncomfortable in new social situations. She is used to public transport, but I always try to make sure we are in a separate seat or in a quieter part of the vehicle so she is at least somewhat comfortable. 

She isn‚Äôt very fond of kids, due to them usually being very loud and impulsive in their movements. She would never bite someone, but I‚Äôd rather not risk it. Too many dog owners actually believe their dog won‚Äôt bite until they do, and I don‚Äôt plan on being one of them. 

I think, what mostly caused me to tell her off immediately is that she didn‚Äôt ask, or didn‚Äôt let my dog sniff her hand first (as you would normally approach an unfamiliar dog). I often allow strangers to pet her, and most of the time she doesn‚Äôt mind. But I always demand them to let her sniff first. If she‚Äôs clearly uncomfortable or arches away from them, I don‚Äôt allow them to touch her.

93,1em7eld,"AITA for telling my mom if she doesn't listen to the family therapist and get solo therapy, I won't engage in family therapy going forward?","My mom, stepdad Jim, who I'd normally say is my mom's husband, and I (16f) are in family therapy together. It started 8 months ago. My mom and Jim have been married since I was 10. They have 2 kids together. My half brother is 5 and half sister is 2.5. My dad, who my mom was married to, died when I was 8. The first therapist made no sense on anything and was even too much for my mom and Jim which says A LOT. Current therapist has been great in my opinion. She met with us all individually for a couple of appointments and then started working with us as a group.

I always knew my mom resented me for crying during her wedding. She has brought it up in therapy while not saying she holds it against me, her words say that she does. I hadn't been super happy about the wedding. The wedding date was kept from me and from people in my dad's family so they visited that weekend and I couldn't see them, that made me sad, paired with the fact I was sad my mom was marrying someone else and paired with missing my dad, I cried a lot throughout that day. My face was a mess in the photos because of it. She mentioned all those details very exactly so clearly it was something she has thought about a lot.

Jim thought we'd have a father/daughter relationship. He doesn't like that I don't want it. It drives him crazy that we can get along fine but I never want to go beyond that. He considers it more insulting that I don't hate him but still won't accept him as a parent or come to him like I would a parent.

I have mentioned how I don't want Jim to fill the role of dad in my life or primary father figure and if I want a more fatherly figure for something, I prefer going to my paternal relatives who make me feel like an extra connection to my dad. I also confirmed that I don't want to have a relationship with Jim where he'll walk me down the aisle some day and I don't plan on joining him for father/daughter dances like he's invited me to before. I also confirmed my mom and Jim's suspicion that I don't feel close to my half siblings.

My mom brought up the wedding as well as my relationship with my half siblings a lot during sessions and mom fights back against the therapist when she tries to address it. She has said things like I should feel guilty for hurting her on her wedding day and causing so much trouble in the family we now have. The therapist suggested mom and Jim should seek solo therapy. They refused. Mom was deeply offended and argued with both the therapist and me outside of therapy about it. The therapist has asked her why she's so hesitant to utilize solo therapy. Mom has really dug in her heels. A week ago I told mom if she doesn't listen to the therapist and go to solo therapy, I won't engage in family therapy more because we're getting nowhere. She told me I did not get to decide and I did not get to tell her, the parent, what to do and she said therapy was my fault to begin with.

96,1em6two,AITA for telling my parents to give my siblings their blessing to change their names?,"Crazy title. Let me explain. My parents had my three siblings before me. I (17m) am the youngest by several years. By the time I was born my parents had gotten over the pressure from family to name us all family names and they gave me a name they loved and wanted to give a kid. My siblings all got family names, older ones really, and on top of me being younger by several years and disrupting the household, there was a lot of jealousy over the fact I didn't get a name other people considered to be a grandparent name, which all my siblings had.

The digs I get over the name from my siblings have been a lot. We're not close. They resent me. I think being born is something they could have forgiven me for but they really hate their names and resent the fact mine isn't as dated, and yes I know dated is a subjective thing but to them, to the people they went to school with and interacted with, their names were dated. But they keep the names because they know my parents chose them to make their families happy and they want to make our parents happy. So there's this tension around it. But I get the blame instead of our parents.

Pretty recently I learned my brother has been going by a different name with friends and co-workers but he keeps it from the family. He likes it more. He didn't like knowing I had learned it. He said I'd never understand. Which is true, our extended family always hated my name but I always liked it and so did our parents. My siblings never had that. I suspect my sisters might be doing the same. But I don't know for sure.

So I decided to talk to my parents. I told them we all knew they chose my name differently from my siblings names and actually liked mine vs tolerated the names they gave my siblings. I told them it hadn't helped our family dynamics at all and while I understood they were older when they had me and more secure, so felt more capable of doing what they wanted vs caving to family pressure, I thought they should be aware that it could help a lot if they give my siblings their blessing to change their names. They looked shocked and called me out for being so demanding about it. I told them they had their years of doing what their families wanted and they could help their three older kids by reassuring them that changing their names won't piss them off or make them disown them or something. My parents said I was interfering in something that really wasn't my place. And I shouldn't talk to them like I had.

99,1em5je6,AITA for refusing to take care of my siblings' dogs?,"4 years ago my parents bought a second house, for my sister, brother and me. It's a fairly big house with 3 bedrooms and a large garden. Soon after moving, both of them decided to adopt 2 big dogs, without even telling me anything. Not going into reasons because it's not relevant I'll just say that I really, really, REALLY, dislike dogs.

My siblings don't take proper care of them, they just feed them, rarely take them out, and most of the times let them do their business in our garden. The dogs are 100% untrained, 200% spoiled. Our garden is literally filled with dog poop and they refuse to clean it, the house is constantly full of dog hair and dirt that they bring inside and I'm the only one who's always cleaning the mess.

Well, going to the point: last night we had a discussion at dinner. My brother is planning to move to an apartment with his girlfriend. My sister got a new job offer in another town and is also planning to move there in the near future. Great, I said, I will have the house all for myself and I can even ask my boyfriend to come live here. Except that they said they are not taking the dogs with them.

I made clear that they were the ones who adopted the dogs, I never wanted them! They started making up excuses like ""the dogs belong here, they are used to live here we can't move them, they are used to be together we can't separate them"" and also the worst one: ""the dogs own the house as much as I do"". I replied that dogs are animals and can't own anything, and I made very clear that I am NOT taking care of them, and that if they move and leave the dogs here, I am rehoming them the next day or take them to a shelter.

Not going into reasons because it's not relevant I'll just say that I really, really, REALLY, dislike dogs.

My siblings don't take proper care of them, they just feed them, rarely take them out, and most of the times let them do their business in our garden. The dogs are 100% untrained, 200% spoiled. Our garden is literally filled with dog poop and they refuse to clean it, the house is constantly full of dog hair and dirt that they bring inside and I'm the only one who's always cleaning the mess.

Well, going to the point: last night we had a discussion at dinner. My brother is planning to move to an apartment with his girlfriend. My sister got a new job offer in another town and is also planning to move there in the near future. Great, I said, I will have the house all for myself and I can even ask my boyfriend to come live here. Except that they said they are not taking the dogs with them.

I made clear that they were the ones who adopted the dogs, I never wanted them! They started making up excuses like ""the dogs belong here, they are used to live here we can't move them, they are used to be together we can't separate them"" and also the worst one: ""the dogs own the house as much as I do"". I replied that dogs are animals and can't own anything, and I made very clear that I am NOT taking care of them, and that if they move and leave the dogs here, I am rehoming them the next day or take them to a shelter.

We had a fight (no violence, just a lot of yelling at each other). I got called names, insulted and even threatened.",0.0,0.021797247231006622,0,1

I got to know through his Insta that he is in my city when he started the trip and I contacted him asking when is he coming back (to board a flight back home) and that he didn't tell me he was in my city. He told me he'll be back on say Wednesday next week and we can meet. 
2-3 days later there was news of heavy rains and flash floods in the area that he went to, I texted to check if he was fine and also saw on his stories that he was fine. Then on Tuesday night, he called me saying he just reached my city and next day early morning he has a flight back.

He said I should visit his city next time and see how nicely he comes to meet up irrespective of date and time.
He then proceeded to ask if I'm happy here or do I feel stuck, if I even have a circle here. As if he wanted to rile me up so that I just visit him.

104,1em4ffc,AITA for not inviting my husband‚Äôs friends to our wedding?,"My husband has a group of 5 guy friends he‚Äôs been friends with for ~14 years. 

A year before our wedding we went on a trip to Maine with one of my husband‚Äôs friends and his wife, Jose & Ashley. I invited my friends, Jen & Miles. My husband and I had fun and my friends Jen & Miles stated they also had a lot of fun. However, Jose & Ash has a different pov. 

I found Ash hid me from social media upon landing. I reached out to clear the air. She claimed everything was ok and stated she hid me from social media to take a break from me, and it‚Äôs what she does when someone is bothering her. I gave her the space to explain and she told me she felt uncomfortable bc ‚ÄúI hate white people‚Äù and didn‚Äôt like that I gave ‚Äúunsolicited advice.‚Äù I tried to figure out why she made those accusations but she beat around the bush and said everything was ok. I dropped it seeing she wasn‚Äôt going to clarify but couldn‚Äôt shake off that she saw me as someone who ‚Äúhates whites.‚Äù (I‚Äôm Hispanic and Ash is white).

I asked Jen & Miles to help me figure out what I did or said during the trip for Ash to make those accusations. Jen said the only thing she could think about was a story I told involving Native Americans in Acadia NP, and how I expressed disagreement with the colonizers who bounty hunted Native Americans. I was upset I was accused of being racist towards whites for a historical account. 

A few months before our wedding, my husband and I canceled our original plans seeing it was way out of our budget (he‚Äôs still in school working on his PhD). We found a small wedding package and went that route. We lost ~10k in deposits but ended up saving a lot more. The only caveat was we were only allowed 28 guests so we had to be extra picky with our guest list. We decided not to invite Jose & Ash given the issue we had and I wanted to feel accepted at my wedding. My husband decided he wouldn‚Äôt invite any of the guys in his friend group as to not make Jose & Ash feel isolated. So we didn‚Äôt invite any of them. 

A month before our wedding, Jose revealed to my husband how they felt about me. Jose stated I compared my adversity to Ashley‚Äôs and made Ashley‚Äôs adversities seem less than mine. He stated he didn‚Äôt like I was outspoken over BIPOC inequalities, and requested my husband shut me up when I got on the topic. Upon hearing how much they disapproved of me we were both relieved we didn‚Äôt invite them. 

We had our wedding and had a blast. But Jose & Ash didn‚Äôt let it go. The friend group started blocking us from social media. We received push back from everyone in the friend group, receiving disapproval for ‚Äúbreaking‚Äù the friend group & being unfair to Ash & Jose. Ash stated we canceled our original wedding plan bc of her and Jose. My husband explained to all of them that our reason was financial, but they didn‚Äôt accept that. Ash claims we were bad friends for not inviting them to our wedding and breaking the friend group. 

AITA?

EDIT: I read that it seems like details are missing. I had a character limit but can share more now. 

We canceled our first wedding plans 4 months before the date. We had to rush to find a plan B and found a micro wedding package in our budget so we booked it. Our plan B wedding was still scheduled for the same month so we had to communicate our new plans with everyone quickly. Our initial guest list was 85 and had to cut it down to 28, so we both had to make cuts off our list. Everyone was supportive, including many of my long-time friends, except for Ash & Jose. My husband did communicate with his friend group about our new wedding plans and told them the same thing we told everyone: our reasoning was financial. 

A couple things did happen in between that may help explain things further. Another member of the friend group, Chris, visited us before the wedding.
We left on good terms and he and his wife told us they understood our decision to cut back on the wedding considering we had just bought a house.
After the wedding, Jose & Ash told us that it was Chris who told them that we canceled our wedding because of them. Thats when my husband explained (again) that the reason was financial, but they didn‚Äôt accept that. My husband called Chris to clarify. Chris admitted that he did say that bc he was upset at Jose (over personal things bw them) and wanted to get back at him. Chris also admitted he spread the rumor. Chris apologized. My husband asked the group for space to think and a week later is when everyone started blocking us and accusing me of breaking the friendships and being unfair to A&J. We never heard back from Chris or his wife. Idk what happened in the week my husband asked for space and idk if Chris ever admitted that he spread the rumor, but I do know the group remained friends.

She has been there for us through this infertility journey more than anyone else we know. And, as you can imagine, has been wanting to celebrate this time with us. 

She begged us to do the gender reveal and we told her several times that we want to keep it intimate and just immediate family. We weren‚Äôt ready to announce our news to anyone just yet because I suffer from anxiety and ptsd from our previous losses.

Our gender reveal day came and despite our clear requests for it to be JUST FAMILY, she invited some of her friends, and friends of the family and her husband‚Äôs family. I was visibly upset and tried to hold it together until after the gender reveal to cry it out because I didn‚Äôt want to cause a scene. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt even enjoy my own gender reveal.

When we did, she took it very personally and felt we were being ‚Äúungrateful and unfair‚Äù.

WHICH IS TOTALLY OKAY! I would love that as me and my sister are very close. 

Recently, I had mentioned to my sister that I'm more than happy for her to come to university with me! But I also mentioned that she can't be knocking on my door every single day as I would like to have aspects of my own life, my own friends and keep some sort of separation to make me feel like an individual. Unfortunately, she has taken this as ""I never want you around my flat, don't even think of coming to the same university as me."" Which simply isn't true. 

  
My sister considers me like a safety blanket, if I'm around, no matter what, she will be okay. Which is the sweetest thing ever! I don't mind that! However, I just don't want her with me 24/7. I want to have my own life. Not only this, but if she is always leaning on me, I worry she won't be able to be her own person as an adult and become co-dependent. I would hate that for her because I can already see traits of this beginning, which will limit her life options. She refuses to go to any university that isn't mine. She's worried if something goes wrong, she won't have anyone to go to and everything will go completely wrong. I just want her to be able to be her own person.

111,1em2ms6,AITA for ignoring my professor ,"I (22F) am taking a summer class with a professor (28M) who has been quite informal with us. We joke around, call him by his first name, and he participates in our jokes. At first, he was nice, but he became more condescending. He‚Äôd sigh or roll his eyes at students asking questions, and his responses to my questions became dismissive.

One day at office hours, after waiting for help, he barely answered my question and then started laughing and chatting with another student across the room. I got frustrated and a girl next to me ended up helping me. Literally all the time after he was just ignoring me even though he was sitting next to me because he was gonna help. Like the whole reason I went to his office hours was for help. I had a mini breakdown, and then he looked up and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be a good actor,‚Äù which was annoying cause what does that even mean. 

Later, in a conversation with him and others, I jokingly mentioned that he didn‚Äôt help me, and he asked why I kept asking him if he wasn‚Äôt helpful and I was like ‚Äú‚Ä¶it‚Äôs cause you‚Äôre the professor‚Äù and he started laughing. I tried again the next day, jokingly asking if he‚Äôd be mean to me again, and he responded with, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find out.‚Äù Sure enough, he was mean, like laughing at my answers or just not answering my questions until I practically begged him for help. At some point I was just like ‚ÄúI think we got off on the wrong foot let‚Äôs start over, I don‚Äôt understand this question can you please help me‚Äù, and then he finally helped. I made such little progress with my work because of how long that took. 

Another time, I asked if he looked at exam grades, meaning if he knew individual student grades directly (I know it was a dumb question). He reacted angrily, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the professor, how do you think this works?‚Äù And he just kept going on and on about how that question didn‚Äôt make any sense and I was so flustered that my face turned red and I just felt so dumb and I didn‚Äôt say anything else. I wanted to say ‚Äúit was just a question‚Äù but I didn‚Äôt. Since then, I‚Äôve been ignoring him, not attending office hours, or acknowledging him in class, which he‚Äôs noticed. He asked me why I‚Äôm ignoring him and I shrugged and he said ok and walked away. 

I‚Äôm worried I might be overreacting or being petty, but his attitude has made me feel dumb and stressed and I feel like it‚Äôs more directed to only me. It bothers me mostly bc he‚Äôs the actual professor, not just some other student. I‚Äôve switched to getting help from the TAs, who are much nicer and actually explain the questions.

112,1em2h1d,AITA for correcting a classmate in front of our whole seminar? ,"I (19 f) am American but did a year of university in the UK through my schools study abroad program. I was one of I think 3 Americans in the entire program at the Uk university so there were not many of us. 

Anyway, I got back a few days ago (I stayed and traveled) and was telling my mom about my time there and I mentioned a confrontation I had in one of our weekly seminar groups. I specified this because our seminar groups are much smaller than regular lecture (20 or so people, most of the time less) and so this didn‚Äôt happen in front of the whole department. 

It was near the end of the time so our conversation was no exactly on topic and somehow we got on the conversation on how different words are pronounced specifically between British people and Americans such as Football and soccer, bathroom and toilets, and a bunch of other stuff. The girl at the table next to me started getting a little heated and says something about how Americans are idiots for pronouncing Nike (nye-key) and not Nike (nyke) and I laughed a little while I explained that Nike is the Greek goddess of victory and that the Greeks pronouncement was more like knee-kay so neither of us were really correct. She got even more upset and started telling me how the British taught Americans English and how we got it all wrong etc. I laughed again because I never thought that the 6 years of learning the revolutionary war over and over again from middle to high school would be useful. So I explained that Americans spoke English because it was a British colony. And that we were a British colony up until 1776. The Americans speaking English are simply a product of colonization, not education. And that if she goes to any place that had an extended British rule they would also speak English in a different dialect than the English because duh. I assumed she was just embarrassed because I wasn‚Äôt even yelling or being mean but she started crying a little and the subject was changed.  

The only reason I ask, because I don‚Äôt really think I am the AH, is because my mother told me I didn‚Äôt need to call her out in front of everyone and that we could have talked about it later as to not embarrass her. I didn‚Äôt really think it was embarrassing because it‚Äôs just a fact to me.

I‚Äôm currently a student at Jobcorps and last week they moved me to a new room.

114,1em2chv,AITAH for having multiple arguments with my wife,"My wife and I have been having a lot of arguments lately. Mostly about insignificant things which boils up into a full on shouting match. She works a healthcare job, where she likes to gossip and bad mouth me with her coworkers as a joke, I guess. 

I have been under a lot of pressure where I‚Äôm working my day job and managing multiple constructions project in the home we live in. So I‚Äôm financially and physically stressed out. My wife contributes nothing for the mortgage and the construction costs which is quickly running up to the mid 5 figures. Also, I‚Äôm fixing what I can on my own to save some money.

Tonight I asked her nicely for a small favor that requires 5minutes of her time and is low effort. But she kept saying no, or I‚Äôll do it tomorrow, or forcing me saying I need to beg her. This is her usual behavior, where she pushes things off and forgets about it. I‚Äôll be honest, when I‚Äôm exhausted I can sometimes get irritated quickly. And today was a very physically demanding day (did a bunch of home repairs on my own). Eventually, I got upset and just told her flat out, if she doesn‚Äôt want to help me then just say no. Things escalated to a shouting match. 

I tried to mend things calmly. But she decided that she wants to ignore me and yelled that I always get my way. She said she refuses to talk to me till tomorrow. Also, every time we have an argument she defaults to suggesting a divorce. Which bothers me a lot since I have friends who have gone through one and it ripped them up mentally and physically. I don‚Äôt find it a joking matter, but she loves to bring it up even when we are with out group of friends. 

Also, I usually do a majority of the chores at home. When she was ignoring me she went into the bathroom. I was trying to clean up after dinner and was trying to take the trash out. I knocked on the bathroom door several times saying there is a thunderstorm outside and asked her to quickly pass me the trash so I can clean up for the night. (I take out the trash every night to avoid rats and bug issues). She refused to answer me in any way. I was patiently knocking and after a while I told her I will just come in and take the trash and leave. No answer, so in the heat of the moment, I just went in to take the trash. And she got extremely upset afterwards. 

We also had arguments over how to choose a contractor. I like to double and triple check with contractors on finer details like the materials, and how they will do certain things. But my wife likes to take advice from her mom (who doesn‚Äôt have experience working with contractors or managing home construction projects). They insist that I don‚Äôt be so direct with people. That I should come with a more gentle approach instead of ask straightforward questions. I disagreed and said I‚Äôm paying 20k+ for this work and I can‚Äôt afford mistakes or misunderstandings. So we had another argument about this. 

Please tell me if I‚Äôm the asshole. I am open to changing my approach in talking to her going forward. ",No A-holes here,2024-08-07,"AITAH for having multiple arguments with my wife My wife and I have been having a lot of arguments lately. Mostly about insignificant things which boils up into a full on shouting match. She works a healthcare job, where she likes to gossip and bad mouth me with her coworkers as a joke, I guess. 

I have been under a lot of pressure where I‚Äôm working my day job and managing multiple constructions project in the home we live in. So I‚Äôm financially and physically stressed out. My wife contributes nothing for the mortgage and the construction costs which is quickly running up to the mid 5 figures. Also, I‚Äôm fixing what I can on my own to save some money.

Tonight I asked her nicely for a small favor that requires 5minutes of her time and is low effort. But she kept saying no, or I‚Äôll do it tomorrow, or forcing me saying I need to beg her. This is her usual behavior, where she pushes things off and forgets about it. I‚Äôll be honest, when I‚Äôm exhausted I can sometimes get irritated quickly. And today was a very physically demanding day (did a bunch of home repairs on my own). Eventually, I got upset and just told her flat out, if she doesn‚Äôt want to help me then just say no. Things escalated to a shouting match. 

I tried to mend things calmly. But she decided that she wants to ignore me and yelled that I always get my way. She said she refuses to talk to me till tomorrow. Also, every time we have an argument she defaults to suggesting a divorce. Which bothers me a lot since I have friends who have gone through one and it ripped them up mentally and physically. I don‚Äôt find it a joking matter, but she loves to bring it up even when we are with out group of friends. 

Also, I usually do a majority of the chores at home. When she was ignoring me she went into the bathroom. I was trying to clean up after dinner and was trying to take the trash out. I knocked on the bathroom door several times saying there is a thunderstorm outside and asked her to quickly pass me the trash so I can clean up for the night. (I take out the trash every night to avoid rats and bug issues). She refused to answer me in any way. I was patiently knocking and after a while I told her I will just come in and take the trash and leave. No answer, so in the heat of the moment, I just went in to take the trash. And she got extremely upset afterwards.

115,1em2cf9,WIBTA if I broke down all the boxes that overrun my parents house?,"Throw away account because I don't use reddit but I'm a bit desperate here. I (37F) am a child of immigrant parents. My dad has very limited mobility because of severe hip degeneration (needs surgery), while my mom is in good shape but of course has less energy considering they are nearly 80. My parents have savings, but it isn't much if anything happens health wise, so my mom has been selling on eBay for over 20 years to help pay the bills. It kills me because she is well educated, but the move here for a better life for their two kids took a financial toll. 

She sells a lot of figurines and fragile pieces, which means that everything needs a box of a different size so that shipping is at a minimum and it also requires a lot of packing material. The issue is that the house is now completely overrun with stuff that she is selling, the extra things she doesn't need but had to take because it was in a box lot at an auction, packing material, boxes, and of course regular house things. It's basically the house of a hoarder, even though it wasn't like this 10 years ago. It's a stress response, especially considering their upbringing and trying to save everything, combined with age and my dad's limited mobility. The house is hardly livable and my mom often laments about what a mess it is and that maybe one day she will clean it up, although the way it is now, there is zero chance of that without something changing fundamentally. What would help A LOT is to break down the 1000+ 3D boxes that are in that house (4 bedroom 2.5 bath). Most of them are in the basement, and some are upstairs, but if they were in 2D instead of 3D, it would create a lot of space to sort out the things that fill the rest of the house.

She is very resistant to this because she says that she needs to see them in 3D so that she can spatially reason the size of the box needed for the item. My boyfriend and I have broken down a small portion (\~100) of the boxes as an example where they are sorted by size. This way, she can start with a size in mind, and then unfold them into 3D to see if it works, and if not find another one depending on what she thinks needs to be different from the first one. She says that then she would have to unfold 10 of them to find the one that she needs and it's a problem for her, but I don't see how this makes any sense since she doesn't even know the boxes she has now because she can hardly access any of them, and sometimes spends 1-2 hours looking for the one of the right size. 

Anyone have any advice for how to deal with this? I have been trying to help her with this for years, but I live 2 hours away and she is always so resistant to whatever I try to change, even though to me it just makes sense. I understand she has her habit, but when she constantly complains that she is overwhelmed with the house, but then refuses to try solutions, I am about to just break down the boxes, and maybe even myself.

We moved in with our roommate in early 2023, he recently moved out the last day of July, 2024. Before moving out, he quit his job and wasn‚Äôt able to find another for months. We paid his portion of rent, bills & sometimes food. He sometimes would get odd jobs (yard work & such) and would come up with a little bit of cash here and there ($20-50) but currently he owes us $950 & a bill for the costs of repairing his room after moving out (I‚Äôm just gonna give him the bill the apartment gives us)

I am a very patient person and I consider myself pretty understanding of hard situations and try to give grace whenever I can, but we‚Äôre stressed.

There was tons of other drama, lying, fighting, him practically moving in his girlfriend which we weren‚Äôt comfortable with (She was staying over almost every night by the end & even staying here when he wasn‚Äôt here) When he finally DID get a job he had problems with the first paycheck and though he started working halfway through July, he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt paid‚Äù until August. I took him at his word but got suspicious when he suddenly had a lot of food again, he and his gf went out to to eat and brought home leftovers in boxes, etc. I didn‚Äôt mention it because I didn‚Äôt want to cause more trouble. I just tried to be as friendly as possible.

Our final agreement was that he would start paying us back on the 2nd of August, then every two weeks (on his payday) after that.

My husband told me that if he doesn‚Äôt start paying us back (he doesn‚Äôt believe roommate is going to at all) then he wants to take him to small claims court. I wanted to give him a litttle a grace period in case something happened, mainly so there would be no arguments and we could just be pleasantly surprised if things worked out. We decided grace period was the 8th, giving him a week. 

I heard nothing about pay from him on the 2nd, or after, & I finally reached out to him today, the 6th, to ask if he could pay us by the 8th. 

He responded, letting me know that there was an issue with payroll at his new place, that they weren‚Äôt going to pay him enough yet. He said they gave him a little bit to help pay his rent and that he made up the rest by doing some odd jobs. He told me he can‚Äôt afford us until the 16th. 

He initially told me that he could pay $200 on the 2nd, I said as long as pays SOMETHING by the 8th, that would be fine. Even $20. But he has told me he can‚Äôt, but ‚Äúif he gets anything before the 16th he‚Äôll give it to us‚Äù. I don‚Äôt feel like I can‚Äôt trust this.

122,1em0o8i,AITA for refusing to live with my sister again,"I (22f) currently have an apartment with my (21f) sister. This past 8 months have been lowkey a disaster. Background I moved out at 17 got my first apt, car, ect. While my sister stayed w my parents till 20 years old doesn‚Äôt have a license, has no credit, for awhile lived off her boyfriend till they recently broke up. 

Our lease started with me, her, and her bf but they broke up and he moved out. I have noticed a decrease in her working but never really noticed it till now. 
I got a car because we needed one and I was the only one in our apt w/ a credit history and decent income. I can afford to pay my car payment by myself but we agreed she would help me pay my $200 insurance. The last two months she didn‚Äôt tell me till last minute aka the day before the payment was due that she couldn‚Äôt pay it. Though inconvenient I was able to pay it myself. She then let me know that she was behind on our WiFi bill (she pays WiFi I pay electric) again inconvenient but I had that finances to pay it. Then this week because her boyfriend moved out we had to redo our income verification with our apt. It‚Äôs the first time in 5months I‚Äôve seen her paychecks. She should be making atleast $600 a week. I knew she was giving up a lot of shifts and not working but I didn‚Äôt realize how bad it was till today. Last month she made $300 a week half of the income she should be making. Now that her bf is gone we are paying $900 a month in just rent. That‚Äôs 75% of her income. 

I‚Äôm livid bc it‚Äôs solely due to her immaturity and laziness. She has yet to get her license even when offered to teach her to drive, she has yet to get a credit card even when I offered to help, she has yet to work more even when I told her she needs to. 

This on top of cleanliness issues we consistently fight about. I just can‚Äôt anymore. It feels like I‚Äôm parenting. 

Our lease is up in 4 months and my dad offered to help just in case she can‚Äôt afford it which was a blessing. But I‚Äôve officially decided I can‚Äôt live with her again. I feel bad about that bc I genuinely don‚Äôt know what she would do besides moving across the country to live with my parents. She doesn‚Äôt make enough to live alone and I can‚Äôt see her being approved by herself. But financially I can‚Äôt be screwed over again and again.

Then this week because her boyfriend moved out we had to redo our income verification with our apt. It‚Äôs the first time in 5months I‚Äôve seen her paychecks. She should be making atleast $600 a week. I knew she was giving up a lot of shifts and not working but I didn‚Äôt realize how bad it was till today. Last month she made $300 a week half of the income she should be making. Now that her bf is gone we are paying $900 a month in just rent. That‚Äôs 75% of her income. 

I‚Äôm livid bc it‚Äôs solely due to her immaturity and laziness. She has yet to get her license even when offered to teach her to drive, she has yet to get a credit card even when I offered to help, she has yet to work more even when I told her she needs to. 

This on top of cleanliness issues we consistently fight about. I just can‚Äôt anymore. It feels like I‚Äôm parenting. 

Our lease is up in 4 months and my dad offered to help just in case she can‚Äôt afford it which was a blessing. But I‚Äôve officially decided I can‚Äôt live with her again. I feel bad about that bc I genuinely don‚Äôt know what she would do besides moving across the country to live with my parents. She doesn‚Äôt make enough to live alone and I can‚Äôt see her being approved by herself. But financially I can‚Äôt be screwed over again and again. ",0.0,-0.00995005201548338,0,1
123,1em0jc9,AITA for telling my sister that she wasn‚Äôt my sister anymore? ,"So some context, I (26f) have 2 half siblings (48f & 46m) and 1 full sibling (32f). I have always been closest to my full sibling (we‚Äôll call her E) as we grew up together compared to my half siblings who were well and truly moved out and running their own lives by the time I was born. 

So over the last year my half sister, we‚Äôll call her L, has been completely off the rails with alcohol and mental health, she also has some severe narcissistic traits. My parents (we share a dad, but my mum is her step mum) have dropped everything to help her clean out her house, but a new business, help her get on track, but she refuses to admit she has an alcohol problem. So despite their help, she remains off the rails denying there‚Äôs anything wrong. 

Flick to last week. My parents who are in retirement have set off on a 3 month trip. Which is well deserved and we are all happy they are getting to travel to the places they‚Äôve always wanted. So they made a group chat to share photos with a heap of our family. So one night L gets drunk and sends a message saying how awful she feels that they can travel all over the countryside but not come visit her in her new location and that every photo just makes her sad. She then left the group chat. 

I got severely angry about this, because my parents didn‚Äôt deserve that. They had already had in depth conversations with L about how they weren‚Äôt going in that direction and towing a caravan through the city is too stressful. And that they would come visit her another time. So for her to continue on this instead of just being happy for them is so selfish imo. 

So I sent her some text messages. Basically telling her how selfish and ungrateful she was. And that she needs to get her life together. Truth hurts sort of stuff. 

Now here‚Äôs to where I might be the AH, in my last message I told her she wasn‚Äôt my sister anymore after what she had done in the GC. 

I have no remorse for this, however my full sister and a couple of my friends think it was pretty harsh to say.

124,1em0bc9,AITA for how I responded to my friend (34F) criticising my brother (38M)?,"My (43F) brother, let‚Äôs call him Tom (38M) has never had a relationship.  He had a really bad stutter in his childhood and 20s and was so anxious and insecure about it that he wouldn‚Äôt date (nerves make stuttering worse).  He‚Äôs actually quite good looking, keeps fit, has a good job and is intelligent and funny.  I do have friends who are pretty blunt who insisted there must be something wrong with him, until they met him and said he‚Äôs actually a great person, really attractive and they‚Äôve literally never seen this before. 

He just never really wanted a partner and is happy without one.  If his soulmate landed right in front of him he‚Äôd date them but he has no motivation at all to find someone.

I also have a friend, let‚Äôs call her Pam (34F).  She really wants a partner and is dead set wanting a marriage and kids.  She was lamenting the lack of available men and said she‚Äôd date ‚Äòanyone‚Äô so if anyone knows a single guy she‚Äôd date them.  I said I had two single brothers but not sure how much they‚Äôre up to dating at the moment.  She scoffed at the idea, which was a bit confusing since she‚Äôd never met my brothers and I changed the subject because that was quite irritating.

Fast forward six months and I have about 10 of our friends over to our place and Pam came along, as did Tom.  By this time I‚Äôd completely forgotten the earlier conversation.

Tom stayed a couple of hours and then left and the Pam, in front of the whole table starts rolling her eyes and saying things like ‚ÄòI know why you invited Tom here.  You‚Äôre just desperate to set me up with him so you figured you‚Äôd just spring it on me here hoping I‚Äôll date your desperate brother.  I see you.  I get what you‚Äôre doing.‚Äô

Considering Tom has social anxiety and it was a big deal for him to come that day to a table where he didn‚Äôt really know anyone, and just how mortified he‚Äôd be to hear that, I saw red.

I told her, in front of everyone, that ‚ÄòTom is my brother. He will always have a place at my table.  The only desperate one here is you since you literally said six months ago that you‚Äôll date ‚Äòanyone‚Äô. Tom ticks every single box you keep saying you want in a man yet you‚Äôre talking like he‚Äôs beneath you.  I would never set you up with him because you‚Äôre not his type and he wouldn‚Äôt like you.  I‚Äôve never even mentioned you to Tom because I‚Äôm that sure he‚Äôd reject you outright.

Pam left soon after.  One of the people said she‚Äôs actually interested in my other brother and I said he won‚Äôt be interested in her either once I tell him about her attitude to Tom.

Henceforth she did not work there for long (maybe a week all together). I should mention that my sister(19),let‚Äôs call her Beth, has had a rough time throughout school and our parents encouraged her to try harder but never actually pushed her to do better. Because of this Beth doesn‚Äôt feel the need to apply herself to any of her work. She has struggled to get along with peers and tends to blame everyone for her actions. 
Beth currently lives at home along with me, and sister (20 F) who is currently working on moving in with our eldest sister (23 F).We are welcome to stay at home under the conditions of going to school or having a job. I‚Äôm almost a senior in HS and currently hold the same job as my sister (20) who also goes to college. Beth does not attend college nor plans to. Her chores in place of a job at home are meant to be doing the dishes, and other things which she doesn‚Äôt do without a fight.
When Beth is asked about a job, Beth claims that she is looking (has also claimed to look for multiple hours a day which can be proven otherwise) but also states it is very difficult.The reason she is not taking any jobs is because she thinks that she is not good at anything. But again our family has been encouraging towards her and her abilities throughout everything.

My family (immediate and distant) have tried to give her many options/opportunities for jobs by making a resume for her or going out and finding job applications. We as a family sat her down and helped her apply to 4 jobs online which she claims all have not responded. Beth has gotten very defensive when asked about the applications to the point of lashing out and offending my family. Her behavior has reached the point where she refuses to do housework or anything productive for that matter (including personal hygiene). She mainly sits at home and ridicules not only my sister (20) and I, but also our mother over small mistakes or questions.

126,1em03mv,AITA for bringing an uninvited guest to a destination wedding?,"I (26F) was invited to a wedding within my state but far enough that to attend I'd have to sleep over at a hotel for at least two nights if I arrived the night before as it was planned to be a pretty much all-day affair.  

I was very flattered to be invited as I didn't think I was that close to the couple. It was a fairly small wedding (\~60 guests including the bridal party). Obviously as it was very small and I was possibly a second round invitee I didn't get a plus one. Fine with me.

I ultimately decided to go. When I went to book the hotel room for my stay I found they only had large rooms available (multiple beds or king beds etc) as it's a popular wedding destination and is a bit fancy. So, I thought, why not invite my boyfriend (26M)? That way we could trade off on the long drive there and back and share the big room I would have to pay for anyways. The idea was that night we arrived we could get dinner together somewhere new and have a nice breakfast before heading back home. While I was at the wedding events he could just hang out in the hotel room or the pool or whatever.

The wedding went great, but then after it wrapped up, the maid of honor (who I'm closer to than the bride) was chatting with me as I walked back to my room and I knocked on the door instead of digging through my bag for the keycard. When my boyfriend opened the door for me the MoH just greeted him and walked off. I didn't think it was a big deal or anything.

A few days later the MoH reached out and said it was awkward and uncomfortable for me to have invited him to the hotel and it made 'everyone' feel bad and weird that he was there waiting for the wedding to end when they hadn't invited him. 

We were both a bit surprised! No one even knew he was there because it didn‚Äôt come up at all during the wedding. It definitely wasn‚Äôt a secret, and honestly, we wouldn‚Äôt have thought it was a big deal if people did know. AND he had only met the bride and groom like six times and had zero issues with not being invited to such an intimate wedding. Also if it matters I was far from the only guest who didn't get a plus one and I never asked to be given a plus one for him. 

I have no clue if the MoH told the bride and if the bride also thinks this was inappropriate. If she hasn't I really don't want to contact her during her honeymoon to start drama.

So when we got to the store, she went to the alcohol section. I told her  ‚Äúmom no, I told you I‚Äôd only bring you if you don‚Äôt buy beer‚Äù she got upset and confrontational and kept trying to walk past me and not listen to me about my feelings on everything. When I tried to stop her from walking away, she got very upset. I wasn‚Äôt being rude towards her, I kept telling her my rule was because I cared for her, and she had already bought 2 cases of beer within the past day, and it was all gone. I then gave her the option to put the beer back and wait till she can drive herself, or walk home. She chose the beer. So I drove home. I cried the whole way home because I felt bad. I‚Äôm not trying to be a asshole to her, I just want her to see I care, and that I feel hurt because I personally feel like I was just used as a lift to feed her addiction. And I just want to feel like I‚Äôm her kid and she‚Äôs my mom. I leave for college in a few weeks and this whole situation has cause so much tension between us, and no matter how I express my emotions to her about the situation, whether calm or not, she won‚Äôt listen to me. And now she is refusing to help pay for college stuff she said she would help with, and I am just stressed and I am overthinking a lot. I already struggle a lot mentally, I‚Äôve been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety, and this is just making me want to not be here rn. I am either overwhelmed with guilt and feel like I am a shitty daughter, or I feel really hurt by my mom and want to leave home and not see her before I go to college. And those feelings are even harder when feeling both at the same time. And I‚Äôve tired for years to figure out how to help my mom and every attempt has not worked. And idk. Now I‚Äôm just rambling, but advice and opinions would be great. And if I am the asshole, i genuinely didn‚Äôt mean to be. Im just confused and hurt.",0.0,-0.003200978273525834,0,1
129,1elzkno,WIBTA if I did not attend my friends wedding as the MOH?,"As the title states, I was asked to be my best friend of 10+ years, maid of honor in her wedding. For the past 3-4 years, our friendship has slowly drifted due to her not putting effort into hang outs, or reaching out in any way.

She grew up very rich and still is. I however, am not. The other bridesmaids are also very rich. I quickly began trying to plan her bachelorette. I asked her directly what she wanted, not specifics but if there was an overall vibe she liked. She said that as long as everyone could be together, that is what mattered to her.

I put a group chat together with all of the bridesmaids to start planning this bachelorette. I said the bride wants us to all be together so everyone keeps that in mind. I then individually asked everyone what their budget would be. I got vastly different answers so I created an average number that would work for everyone. 

I was quickly overruled and my ideas were called ‚Äúnot the vibe‚Äù. They started to plan it, it costed 2,000 per person. I can‚Äôt afford this so I said I could only so two activities for the weekend.

The party was this past weekend, I get to the first event on time. The person who insisted on driving the bride got her there an HOUR and 15 mins after the reservation time (the res is only a 90 minute slot). Everyone else was 45 mins late. I sat in my car for over an hour and because this was the only thing I could do with the bride, I left. I told her I wouldn‚Äôt be there and my reasoning. There was 15 mins left in the res, I didn‚Äôt see why I would stay just to leave so soon after. 

The only other thing I could attend was a dinner the next day. I then received texts from people saying I flaked on her, how could I do that, etc. Everyone was saying what a horrible friend I was. I made the decision to just skip the dinner and told the bride her and I could do something special just the two of us to make up for it. She said she understood and that was fine. 

The brides sister sent me a huge text explaining that i‚Äôm a horrible person, friend etc. 

Jump to an hour ago, I have a phone call with the bride. Apparently she told her sister to send that to me, and thought it was good I hear it. She also said she shouldn‚Äôt have told me all she cared about was everyone being together for the bachelorette, because she was very happy that they all spent all that money and went above and beyond for her. She said many things that showed her lack of understanding regarding finances, as well as saying i‚Äôm a bad friend.  We both agreed we have very different values and have grown apart. 

She seems to want to continue a friendship though and for me to come to the wedding. I however don‚Äôt think our friendship is salvageable and what she has said to me has hurt me beyond repair. This on top of the entire bridal party absolutely hating me is making question attending the wedding. This all feels very disingenuous now.

131,1elytrz,AITA for refusing to watch in-laws dog while they‚Äôre out of town,"My in-laws have asked my husband and I to watch their dog at their house while they‚Äôre out of town from Christmas to New Year‚Äôs. They take this trip twice a year, once in the summer and once in the winter, and typically we‚Äôve been the ones asked to watch the dog to which we‚Äôve agreed in the past. This is the first time we‚Äôve refused.

The dog is 14, has a very strict food diet, strict medicine regime, is deaf, wears diapers at night, struggles to stay asleep, and struggles with OCD. We‚Äôve watched her several times previously, and it‚Äôs been difficult to keep track of her while we both try to work (we both wfh), and as time has gone on and she‚Äôs gotten older, it gets more difficult. My husband has to sleep in a separate room with the dog so that I can get a good nights sleep (which isn‚Äôt fair to him either IMO).

Aside from the responsibilities of caring for the dog, we would be staying at their house, meaning we would be working from their couch, leaving our home office (multiple monitors and desk space) at home. My job is pretty demanding and working from a single laptop can be difficult at times - their wifi isn‚Äôt great either which has made my zoom meetings a nightmare.

The other issue is that this would be between Christmas and New Year‚Äôs, meaning that we‚Äôd spend this time away from our friends, sitting in their house, with nothing to do during the holidays. We live about 3 hours away.

Despite all this, we still kind of feel like the assholes because his parents have no one else to watch the dog.

I don‚Äôt really know how to explain this briefly, but I had a pretty rough childhood. My mum (48F), has been an alcoholic, a drug addict and a dealer for my entire life. I lived in danger for many years in crackhouses and had to teach myself a lot of basic medical knowledge due to my mum and her friends either passing out on our floor or overdosing a few times. I lived in filth and neglect, and when I was 11 she had my brother (10M), who I basically cared for and raised on my own for my teenage years.

When I was 16 and my brother was around 4, our house was raided by the police. It was really traumatic for me and I fell into a depression and tried to off myself. When the psych nurses in the hospital asked me why, I explained everything above and that I was often scared for my life in that house. I explained that if I didn‚Äôt off myself, one of my mother friends or her abusive boyfriend would, and I also didn‚Äôt wanna be around for the day I found my mother dead on the floor. It was all very distressing. 

They called child protection services and my brother and I were taken out of our mother‚Äôs care (finally), and placed into foster care. We‚Äôre the luckiest kids in the world for having the best grandparents ever (my mum‚Äôs parents). For the first time in our lives, we ate proper food, we lived in a clean house, and I actually learned how to do washing and other basic chores that I had never learned.

Now onto my mother. We still have contact with her due to our grandparents being her parents (although let me make it clear my grandparents do NOT like her at all). I have invited my extended family, but honestly the thought of having my mother at my birthday party makes my skin crawl.

I keep her at an arms length for good reason.

 I have a daughter (8), a dog in training, and my nieces and nephews all under 6 years old who come a visit every day. I have no way of knowing if the neighbor's dogs have been to a vet, have received shots, etc.; however, I've  spent 2 months contacting my neighbors every time the dogs show up.

They promised to build a fence; it didn't happen. They promised to keep them off our property; it didn't happen. They've even implied that we are trying to take their dogs or lure them to our property. So, today, I called the county police to come and handle the situation and ask the neighbors to keep their dog at home. Now, one of the neighbors is texting me and accusing me of being an unfriendly neighbor (not the words she used, but I don't want to get banned.)

137,1ely0w3,WIBTA for asking my boyfriend to get fired from his job for my benefit?,"My boyfriend (M21) and I (F20) have had a family trip to visit my grandparents planned for months. My dad, brother, and I go twice a year‚Äî it‚Äôs about a 6 hour drive. We‚Äôre supposed to leave next week. This year I convinced my dad and my extended family to let my boyfriend of a year, and my brother‚Äôs boyfriend come as well. This took some negotiating with the fam. My grandfather is old fashioned so instead of us all staying on their farm like usual, the deal is that my brother, me, and our significant others are staying in an airbnb a few minutes from their house. My dad is paying. (I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs renting from a family member for cheaper than it would usually be.)

I‚Äôve been pestering my boyfriend for over a month to request off work from his restaurant job and he guaranteed that getting off would be no issue. However, he‚Äôs already taken off for two separate family vacations of his own, one of which I also went on, and his boss recently told him that if he cannot take another weekend off. He‚Äôs the only cook on his shift so we can‚Äôt have a coworker cover it for him. The main event of this trip is a family reunion that falls on his working weekend. He also doesn‚Äôt have a car so we can‚Äôt drive separately.

Some important context with this situation is as followed:

a) I told him a week ago that I would understand if he can‚Äôt come but he needs to tell me now so I can plan accordingly. He promised he would come no matter what.
b) Him falling through on things is somewhat of a reoccurring issue that he‚Äôs supposed to be working on, so him missing this trip would be a huge blow for me. We‚Äôre supposed to leave 3 days after our 1 year and we made a big deal about us both doing better for each other and turning over a new leaf in the next year.
c) My family went out of their way to compromise with us despite their old fashioned values. My brother‚Äôs boyfriend probably wouldn‚Äôt have planned to come, nor would we be staying in an airbnb if it wasn‚Äôt for the fact that I was bringing my boyfriend. 

My boyfriend isn‚Äôt planning on staying at his job much longer anyway as he has kind of out grown it. He doesn‚Äôt mesh with management super well and all of his good friends who he worked with have recently left. He‚Äôs been talking about quitting. I know a piece of him is super attached to it though, and honestly I kinda am too. We‚Äôre both super torn on this situation. My trust will be broken if he doesn‚Äôt end up coming, and I will be devastated because I planned so many things to show him in the area. However, I don‚Äôt want him to let himself get fired if he‚Äôs not truly ready to leave, and then have him resent me for it. I wish he had been more forthcoming about probably not being able to come.

He asked me what I would do in the situation. Would I be the asshole if I told him I still want him to come on the trip with me?

My son will be 1 years old in December and that‚Äôs a very crucial time of the moving process. 
My family is expecting us to have something for my son‚Äôs birthday. They would fly to Hawaii to celebrate. I‚Äôm very stressed thinking about it. This year has been a lot with traveling and having family come visit throughout the year. We haven‚Äôt had much time to breathe honestly. 
We really don‚Äôt want anyone visiting. It would put too much on our plate to accommodate and plan and I don‚Äôt have the mindset to any of it. My husband and I agreed that we will not have visitors for our son‚Äôs birthday. We will have something small with just us 3. 
Now here‚Äôs the thing, knowing my family they will still come out.  
I say this because 
1. When I told my mom about having his birthday in California where most of my family is she was bummed because her and my oldest sister really want to come to Hawaii. They are done going to California. They live in other states. 
2. They pulled this when I was pregnant. I said no visitors for one month after the baby is here. Well they already planned and talked about getting an air bnb the month I was suppose to be due without talking to me. Their excuse was well this is our vacation. 
That was so unfair because we live on an island I have no choice but to have you guys see the baby when he‚Äôs due. They ended up not coming out but I was really upset. 
THATS what I expect to happen in this situation. 
They will still come out and say this is for them but AITA if I say okay great you won‚Äôt see us. 
I don‚Äôt own the island they can do whatever they want and travel wherever they want. 
Again it‚Äôs just really unfair living on an island because to them of course we‚Äôre gonna see them but I really want to say NO. 
I know I‚Äôll be an AH to them.

She abandoned it at a shop and a year later he found out because the shop called him to say they sold the vehicle since it was never picked up (they did something shady and re-vinned the car to sell it)

She leaves her kids home overnight and for days to party or chill with men/friends.

When the kids arent with us they spend the majority of the time at the grandparents.

She abandoned them with the grandparents for a year and a half and wouldnt even visit on birthdays. They then told her she needed to be more responsible and come get them.

Why am I mentioning all this? Because I would be more understanding (maybe) had the car been purchased for her to take her kids to school and sports but when she has her moms or had her bfs car she makes them walk everywhere and uses the car to ‚Äúgo to parties‚Äù as the kids have told us.

Also please note that we had this conversation about me not thinking it was a good idea to purchase a vehicle for her. He went behind my back anyways and offered to buy her one. The money is coming out of our household so the fact that I wouldnt know where a large amount is being allocated is wild to me. 

Last thing I have to say is two years ago I was all for him buying her a car‚Ä¶ when it was offered she said she ONLY wanted a luxury vehicle with 7 seats to accommodate all of her kids which is not just the ones my husband shares with her. When he said he could only buy her something more affordable at that point  as he was down bad she did not accept it.. if she needed a vehicle for the right reasons I‚Äôd think she would take a more affordable car in the meantime.

The money is coming out of our household so the fact that I wouldnt know where a large amount is being allocated is wild to me. 

Last thing I have to say is two years ago I was all for him buying her a car‚Ä¶ when it was offered she said she ONLY wanted a luxury vehicle with 7 seats to accommodate all of her kids which is not just the ones my husband shares with her. When he said he could only buy her something more affordable at that point  as he was down bad she did not accept it.. if she needed a vehicle for the right reasons I‚Äôd think she would take a more affordable car in the meantime.

I just want to see how ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù it is to do something like this and constantly provide for an ex partner when there is a CO and her and kids get whatever they need on top of CS.",,0.037958286702632904,0,0
