My other friend says that she and him are dealing with shit so he can't talk much. I'm fine with this, but I just wish he had told me. I feel like he doesn't want to be friends with me anymore. I know he has several mental illnesses, so do i. I just want him to be okay.

1,1elxc42,AITAH for telling my friendâ€™s dad?,"For context: I recently got a new car, and my dad loves it. I canâ€™t complain, he *does* pay for my gas! Recently heâ€™s been trying out all kinds of new things with it. 
Iâ€™m house sitting for a friend, mainly to take care of her Guinea pigs. I go twice a day, but sometimes Iâ€™m not there, so I have my dad do it. My friendâ€™s whole family is away except for the dad, who is unable to care for them on his own due to back issues.
The way I get into the house is by opening the garage via an opener that I find in the backyard. 
My dad likes simplifying things, so he programmed it into my new car. Without telling anyone!! I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy, because I could technically just walk in anytime. 
I felt like the dad should know, so I kindly texted him a heads up about it, and that we could unprogram it if needed. Luckily the dad was super nice and understood.
My mom and dad are upset at me for telling, but I honestly feel he had the right to know. Itâ€™s his house and garage opener. 
Am I the asshole? Did I do the right thing? Do I have the right to be upset?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-07,"AITAH for telling my friendâ€™s dad?
