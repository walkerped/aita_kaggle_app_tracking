0,1en1w0b,AITA for answering honestly about me being trans?,"My aunt (31 F, aka “Jane”) isn’t my biological aunt. She’s been in my life since I was born. This happened in April, and my aunt Jane is still ignoring me (18 trans M). We used to be very close before she met her now-husband (43 M, aka Joe). Jane and I used to be VERY close, as I considered her like a second mother. Joe came into the picture when I was 16, but nothing between Jane and I changed, until the day of the wedding. Now the problem…

Before the ceremony, Joe, best man, and Joe’s son (16 M, aka Luke) had to run to Jane’s home to get her camera. The whole ride was a bit awkward, as I was in the middle-back seat beside Luke. I’d never spoken to him before, as he was a child from Joe’s previous relationship… we made small talk, and I was under the impression that he wasn’t put off by me wearing a suit. Luke had suddenly asked “Are you transgender?” out of nowhere. Now, I’m pre-testosterone, meaning my voice and looks are very feminine and I haven’t had any surgery. While under this impression he wasn’t bothered, I answered truthfully “Yes, I’m a trans guy.” but I didn’t know my Aunt Jane told no one at the wedding (besides Joe and people who already knew me outside of Jane) that I was a trans guy. Luke’s response was “oh great, now I’m uncomfortable.” This really caught me off guard, and I was hurt because I was trying to get along with Luke. 

I said nothing for the rest of the ceremony, since I was insecure of making more people uncomfortable. After people went inside to the venue, I stayed outside and went off to the side to let myself cry so I could calm down before facing anyone again. Long story short, my mother (42 F) found me crying and hugged me until I admitted what had me so upset. My mother wanted to go ballistic, but I begged to just leave because I was horrified by making people uncomfortable.

2 weeks later, after Jane and Joe returned from their honeymoon my mother broke the news of what happened between Luke and I. Needless to say, Jane had no reaction but Joe definitely did. Despite how well Joe and I got along, he turned out to be transphobic. He mocked, insulted, and said some slurs towards me, and went as far as saying I was disgusting. He claimed Luke did nothing wrong, and I needed to grow thicker skin and was a snowflake. Now I feel conflicted, I’m happy for Jane’s successful day, but pissed with Joe. But regardless, they all started ignoring me after this.

I’ve been out of the closet as trans for 5 years now, and I’ve never had someone act THIS transphobic. I’m also hurt by my aunt not defending me at all, she never messaged or called or spoke to me to ask if I was okay, or even to plan anything with me. I feel like I was just pushed out of my best friend’s life. I tried calling, and I was ignored. I was sent nothing but an apology from Luke, but it was obvious he didn’t write it.. Luke shared views with Joe, and the way he said he wasn’t transphobic was practically a joke. AITA?

1,1emyyvg,AITA for asking my partner not to sleep with someome?,"Hi, I (29m) and my partner 29(mtf if that matters?) Have been together for about 3 years now. In the last couple months they asked to open the relationship because I wasn't ""putting out"" enough for them. I reluctantly agreed. At first it actually seemed to be beneficial for us as we were talking more and just generally were happier! So, I get 2 days off a week and they work their own schedule. The problem arose because during both my days off this week, they decided to go out and hook up with strangers. I didn't mind as much the first day as it's whatever we have another day to spend together. Then, they proceeded to do the same again on my other.  I even asked earlier in the day if they'd stay home and spend the day with me since I'll be working for the next several days and they can do what they want then. They insisted and went out during the day. Later on, I asked for them not to go out again. They proceeded to get annoyed with me and got upset over me restricting them from ""going out and being social"". I felt like they didn't care about me wanting time with them. They excused it with ""I spend so much time with you as it is. I want to go out and be social"". They ended up asking for space and I left the apartment for an hour and came back to them gone.

4,1enkm48,AITA for not buying my older sister a gift during my trip to Europe.,"I 22M saved up and self-funded a 3-week trip to Europe and got back in mid-July. A little back story, I come from a family of 5 1 mum, 1 dad (they are now divorced), and 2 sisters one older and one younger ( I am the middle child) we were all born and raised in England but we moved over to Canada when we were 6 and have been making trips over to visit our extended family ever since. When me and my sisters turned 14 we went back to see our family by ourselves and we all bought each other and our parents presents because they could not join us, and the same would go for our parents when they would go visit. That being said it was not like we had a tradition set up because when me or my siblings have gone away with friends or to other places we would not return with gifts. Flash forward to this year my friend offered me a ticket to go see Taylor Swift in Amsterdam which I accepted, since Amsterdam is pretty close to England I decided to take some extra time off work and visit all my relatives there since it has been a long time since I last visited. I had 1 month to save up as much money as I could before I left, during that time both my mum and my dad each went back to England to visit their respective sides of the family and returned with all of the English treats for me and my sisters liked to get whenever we would go, and other items that we asked them to get for us on our behalf. I thought to myself that since both of my parents had been back to England I wouldn't need to get gifts for anyone since they bought all the treats we liked and I would only be going a month after them not a year. During my trip it was my younger sisters birthday so I picked up a present for her, I would have done the same thing if I was away for my older sisters birthday. I also made both of my sisters Taylor Swift friendship bracelets too. Upon returning I gave my younger sister her birthday present and my older sister asked me why I did not get anything for her I replied that I only got younger sister a gift due to the fact I was away for her birthday and that if that I wouldn't have done other wise because we just got a bunch of gifts and treats from our parents trip a month prior.

6,1enj86b,AITA for being ungrateful for my million dollar education,"I am a pretty mediocre person. I’m 26 and have an office job that I am just okay at & I am slowly trying to save for a home. 

That should be fine, but compared to my parents and siblings I am a big disappointment. My parents are first-gen immigrants & successful professionals who have done well in their fields but are not insanely wealthy. My 3 siblings all have very impressive careers.

My parents invested heavily in our education & I wish they hadn’t done that for me, as ungrateful as it sounds. I went to expensive private schools in NYC from preschool through high school, and it wasn’t good for me.

I could never excel among the peers I had— most kids around me were either extremely smart, or extremely wealthy, and I didn’t fit in to either group. My family always said to just compete with everyone through hard work, but I had peers who regularly did 16 hour days & worked or studied through the weekends. I tried to keep up but I couldn’t, and sometimes I would get burned out and depressed.

I had a few good friends but always felt insecure. I was just kind of shy, unremarkable and boring & therefore often excluded from socializing with the more competitive or glamorous kids. I didn’t leave with some kind of spectacular network.

With all the help I had, I was able to go to a good college & eventually prestigious first job. But my work lagged behind my peers and my company let me know there wasn’t a future for me there. 

So finally I accepted it & just got a “normal” job at a large company. I’ve accepted that I’m not on a path to a super high-paying job so I’ve decided to leave NYC for a more affordable city.

When I told my parents, it caused a huge fight: they yelled at me for not prioritizing living near family, “giving up on my dreams” and wasting all the opportunities they tried to give me.

It really struck a nerve because I have felt sick about that for years. I was given opportunities most people will never have & that less privileged people can only dream of and it was totally wasted on me. It just made feel like a disappointment.

But for once I snapped and yelled at them back. I said I never asked them to do that & I wish they hadn’t wasted their money. I said my dream was to someday have my own home, yard, family, dog and some free time and they could have just sent me to public school and bought me a house if they really wanted my dreams to come true because all my education did for me was show me how unspecial I am and make me exhausted and depressed.

Now my parents & siblings have all called me ungrateful and aren’t speaking to me. 

After 16 years of private school & 4 years of university, my parents spent literally over a million dollars on my education. I know I’m not entitled to a single dollar of their money but I hate that they wasted it & it will take a very long time for me to afford a home, and I will never live a life as nice as the one I grew up with, so I can’t help wishing things had been different.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-08,"AITA for being ungrateful for my million dollar education I am a pretty mediocre person.

7,1enj7uo,AITA for not driving my mom to work?,"I (22F) an currently applying to medical school and am waiting for interviews. As a result, I have a lot more free time and am my parents go-to volunteer for changing my plans to stay at home or pick up my  mom from work. Also taking care of the family dogs even when others are at home. I’ve been slowly getting fed up because it feels like my personal time is insignificant to them.

My mom works at a hospital where they charge her $13 for parking. Extremely ridiculous, and while my family can afford it, we try to get family members drop off my mom and pick her up to save. This used to be mainly my dad but I’m currently being roped.

Basically, one day ago my mom called me while I was in the middle of doing something asking me to pick her up from work. She had gotten off early and had expected me to know that I was going to pick her up (without telling me). Because I was in the middle of some thing I sent over my older brother. This left her in a bad mood because she asked for me. She also accused me of conveniently being busy at “that hour” and not any other time to avoid picking her up. I ignored this.

I took her to work this morning and later when she came back, she asked me if I could take her to work tomorrow morning. I said no because I have a gym class around the same time and I wouldn’t able to make it back in time. The gym I go to also doesn’t offer any other class earlier in the day or later so I couldn’t make it up. My schedule is also pretty tight, so I only have so many days to go to when my gym offers these classes.

My mom got mad at this and asked me if I could skip. I told her no because I had missed my other class this week I attend after working an overnight and that I pay money for the membership. I was also looking forward to the class all week. She asked me why I couldn’t go anytime else during the day and I explained that I only have the membership for the classes, I hate working out by myself.

She then called me selfish and while I understand why she’s frustrated and wants to save $13, she also made me skip my volunteering activities this week to help out with stuff going on in the house when it would’ve been no hassle to reschedule when others were in the house.


Also, when I didn’t react to her going off about me being selfish and how she made sacrifices of taking me to sports growing up she said she didn’t like my “attitude”. I just shrugged and went back to baking my banana bread.

8,1enj6wa,AITA over my wife's kids,"So married for the first time going on 3 years. She has two boys, 17 and 20. The younger is actually getting his act together and is more academic. The older dropped out, threw away a football scholarship (potentially as he was very gifted). For the past three years it's been hell. He doesn't help out, doesn't help mow the lawn, take out trash, and even clean his room. I've tried the nice guy routine, that doesn't work.

I went to the thermostat and mentioned to her that it was at
78 Fahrenheit. I asked ""Why did she turn the AC off?"" she said it's because she was cold and went into her room and slammed the door.

Recently I learned one of my friends Brad is acting in a musical in my area which shocked me because I didn’t know he did that stuff. So I wanted to watch. Our whole friend group all wanted to go so we decided to book the same row, Row D. I ended up booking it pretty late but there was one seat left: Seat number 3. Now my other friend Joe wanted to book that seat so he can sit next to his girlfriend Becky. However he didn’t get the ticket because he relied on one of our friends Jimmy to book the ticket for Joe. I knew this already happened but my logic was that it’s not my fault Jimmy didn’t buy the ticket so I decided to book the last seat because I wanted to watch the show and frankly I don’t care what Joe wants he should’ve booked the ticket himself but apparently he didn’t have a card. INFO: the theater doesn’t take cash you have to use cards to book online. So anyway I book it and now Row D is full and Joe is now mad because I got the seat and I’m now apparently sitting with his girlfriend. I told him that’s not my problem because he relied on Jimmy, who is incompetent as hell, to get his ticket. Joe asked me to give the ticket to him so he can sit with his girlfriend and he’s been friends with Brad longer than I have so he should be able to watch. I told him I don’t care and hung up because I already paid and I’m not passing this play up. I told him to book a ticket for the row in front of us or ask Becky to move but he doesn’t want to and is now not talking to me.

15,1enhuoz,AITA for exposing someone's relationship online,"I would like to stay anonymous as much as possible, but long story short, I know a woman who is a single mother of 5. Her first 3 children, all girls, where from her first marriage and have a 20-year age gap with the younger 2, a boy and girl, who both have different deadbeat fathers out of the picture.

Back before the younger two children came along, the mother dated a man a little older than her, somewhere between 3-10 years I'm not too sure, and she would bring her girls on play dates to her boyfriend's house to play with his sons. Well call him Joe. All the children where around the same age and they got along just fine. The mother and her boyfriend Joe broke up with no hard feelings, and at one point Joe slept with the oldest daughter. And everyone parted ways. 

A couple years the mother then went to have her son, and then got pregnant again with her last child. This last baby daddy then moved in with her and her children, ages 19, 17, and 1. This man claimed the home as his own and did nothing to support the household. Jobless, the man just came and went as he pleased. This pushed the 17yo, well call her Boo, to her breaking point as she worked hard to help with bills. 

One day Boo ran into her mom's old boyfriend Joe, the same one she grew up around and the same one who has children the same age as her. Joe invited her to move in with them to help her get away from the drama of home, and she accepted.  At the age of 17 she moved in with Joe and his 3 kids while he had a girlfriend. For a while things where good, Boo got a job and was able to have less financial responsibilities. Then she stopped reaching out as much, started acting secretive, and all around stopped talking to her family the same. 

Come to find out, Joe had broken up with his girlfriend, and we were pretty positive he starting pursuing/dating Boo the second she turned 18 while she was living with him. This lead to them actively dating, and then secretly getting married 2 years ago when Boo was 19 and Joe was around the age of 55-60.  On Facebook they both kept their profiles to single until Boo got pregnant 9 months, now their profiles both say ""married"" but not who to. Now Boo is 21 and is still married to Joe. She just gave birth this month to her first child, a son, while she actively is raising Joes other 3 children, all of which are in high school. All while keeping their relationship off social media, and never wearing wedding rings.

A couple years the mother then went to have her son, and then got pregnant again with her last child. This last baby daddy then moved in with her and her children, ages 19, 17, and 1. This man claimed the home as his own and did nothing to support the household. Jobless, the man just came and went as he pleased. This pushed the 17yo, well call her Boo, to her breaking point as she worked hard to help with bills. 

One day Boo ran into her mom's old boyfriend Joe, the same one she grew up around and the same one who has children the same age as her. Joe invited her to move in with them to help her get away from the drama of home, and she accepted.  At the age of 17 she moved in with Joe and his 3 kids while he had a girlfriend. For a while things where good, Boo got a job and was able to have less financial responsibilities. Then she stopped reaching out as much, started acting secretive, and all around stopped talking to her family the same. 

Come to find out, Joe had broken up with his girlfriend, and we were pretty positive he starting pursuing/dating Boo the second she turned 18 while she was living with him. This lead to them actively dating, and then secretly getting married 2 years ago when Boo was 19 and Joe was around the age of 55-60.  On Facebook they both kept their profiles to single until Boo got pregnant 9 months, now their profiles both say ""married"" but not who to. Now Boo is 21 and is still married to Joe. She just gave birth this month to her first child, a son, while she actively is raising Joes other 3 children, all of which are in high school. All while keeping their relationship off social media, and never wearing wedding rings. 

But now that you know the important stuff, AITA for making an Instagram revealing that my friends 21-year-old daughter has married someone who dated her mom, slept with her older sister, and most immortally watched her grow up.   ",1.0,0.9633097052574158,1,1

I will def do what is best for my kid. 

Also my car is a 2012 with 235,000 miles on it, so that is really a big issue for me. 

And we do really get along- my ex comes to all holiday gatherings with my family! 

I (49f) have a 13 year old daughter. I am on good terms with her dad (47m)  (we divorced 4 year ago) and he was living less than 2 miles from me (and within walking distance to her school). I have “Sue” 60 % of the time. 

My ex decided to move across the city because he didn’t like his landlord. He told me the other day that we need to find a halfway point to meet for drop off and I said “I didn’t agree to that.” He said “it’s non-negotiable.” 

I am irritated that he didn’t discuss this with me before moving and he just expected me to do a lot of extra driving. I don’t like driving- his new location involves driving through a large metro area which makes me nervous and I have an old car.

Her school and dance studio (she has dance 3 days a week) are less than 2 miles from my house. And all her friends are in this side of town. 

Our divorce agreement doesn’t mention transportation because we are so amicable and we lived so close that it didn’t matter (he used to live about 6 mins away now it will be at least 40mins and def more during rush hour or inclement weather). 

Also, he is a musician part time and I often take her on his days when he gets a gig and he typically doesn’t reciprocate (meaning he doesn’t trade days). And my family helps a lot too, but they don’t want to drive that far either (his family is all out of state so they don’t help).

Today, when I took the dog out, the plastic buckle on the leash broke while I was walking it. The dog immediately escaped and started running wildly. There was a busy road nearby, and it ran straight into the middle of it. There were several instances where cars almost hit it by just a second or two. I was terrified.

This is where my boyfriend says I’m the asshole. Today while my boyfriend and I were discussing the car situation. I told him if he can’t comfortably afford a 5 year loan term or less he cannot afford the car he wants.

The car he wants is around 45k. He was thinking he was going to take out a 7 yr loan on it so he could afford the payments. I told him flat out that was a REALLY stupid idea. 

I tried to explain to him why a 7 year loan term is a really bad idea, especially on a used car. I explained that the interest rates are much higher on long term loans because they’re deemed high risk. I used his sister’s loan as an example.

Yesterday, she just told me that something happened and her boyfriend will be going back with her. He’s going to stay in her room until they can move out next month. 

Of course like the people pleaser I am was just like, oh no worries. But today, I told her that I am unsure and have to think it over because I was caught off guard & because I don’t know who he is. Our other Roomate is also concerned about this because we just don’t know the guy. Just to make things clear, the house belong to my parents and she is a tenant. So is our other Roomate. My parents know them and their families.

Now she is saying that she has no choice, he doesn’t have a job and can’t afford other options, and that it’s unfair since our other Roomate was in a similar situation and I didn’t know who he is. Of course I was also concerned when our other Roomate moved in but I trusted my parents because they actually know the people they are renting to and their families. 

It’s a really hard position for me to be in. I want to say no because of how rude she is to me about it and for all the reasons I’ve already listed. My other Roomate is also really uncomfortable with this and is saying he would move somewhere else if her boyfriend stays here those couple of weeks. I feel like my reasons are legitimate. but I also feel bad just being like “oh not my problem.”

To answer everyone’s questions, I actually don’t know exactly what happened to him.

He even had someone promising to pay for his rent if he can’t afford it. We’re all from the same hometown, so my parents know them and their families. That’s why I was okay with them living with me. I would ask at this point but it feels pointless to ask for more context when I’ve already decided to say no.

I don’t think he would be a squatter? Because she already told me that she would get the keys to her new apartment on a specific day next month.

24,1engtvu,AITA for taking this seat?,"Earlier this year I went to one of my favourite bars. I go in and see the last two seats at the bar. Great! I love sitting at the bar, especailly when I'm by myself. I rush over and take one of the seats.

I notice a guy standing next to the other last seat as I sit down, but assume he's busy making some kind of decision, so I don't pay any attention, carry on and start ordering my drink.

Then, after a brief moment, another man walks over to me and says something like ""those are our seats"", meaning him and the guy standing..

I'm not sure what he means since seats can't be reserved, so I ask him what he, because perhaps they were already sitting here and he went to the bathroom or something.

Apparently, they saw the seats at the same time as me, more or less, and wanted to sit at the bar instead of their table and were in the process of moving when I sat down, but his friend must have been much faster than him, hence being at the other seat when I arrived.

I didn't think it was a fair argument. I honestly didn't see him moving from his table when I walked in and towards the chair. I was totally surprised by the situtation and I believe I could stand my ground, especially since this guy seemed to be so offended and angry. I thought this wasn't quite right, after all, it was arguably just bad luck that I walked in at the same time.

After arguing for a couple of minutes he agreed to let me stay in the seat and went back to his table with his friend but not without calling me a prick and saying something like ""you act like a nice person, but you're a prick"".

Moments later, 3 seats at the bar became available and instead of moving to these seats with his friend, which they could clearly see from their table, they stayed seated.

This made me think that there was more than just a seat at the bar being lost here, like power and pride.

But AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-08,"AITA for taking this seat? Earlier this year I went to one of my favourite bars. I go in and see the last two seats at the bar. Great! I love sitting at the bar, especailly when I'm by myself. I rush over and take one of the seats.

I notice a guy standing next to the other last seat as I sit down, but assume he's busy making some kind of decision, so I don't pay any attention, carry on and start ordering my drink.

Then, after a brief moment, another man walks over to me and says something like ""those are our seats"", meaning him and the guy standing..

I'm not sure what he means since seats can't be reserved, so I ask him what he, because perhaps they were already sitting here and he went to the bathroom or something.

Apparently, they saw the seats at the same time as me, more or less, and wanted to sit at the bar instead of their table and were in the process of moving when I sat down, but his friend must have been much faster than him, hence being at the other seat when I arrived.

I didn't think it was a fair argument. I honestly didn't see him moving from his table when I walked in and towards the chair. I was totally surprised by the situtation and I believe I could stand my ground, especially since this guy seemed to be so offended and angry. I thought this wasn't quite right, after all, it was arguably just bad luck that I walked in at the same time.

AITA for being furious with my friend group for only reaching out when they need something, like money, and calling them fake?

I’m part of a small friend group of four, and I’m really fed up. They frequently exclude me from plans and social events, rarely involve me in school projects, and the only way they contact me is through iMessage. They haven’t added me on Instagram or any other social media, which makes me feel like they’re deliberately keeping me at a distance.

Recently, one of them asked me for $50. I was extremely frustrated because it felt like a perfect example of how they only reach out to me when they need something. I called them out, saying that they were acting like fake friends who only value me for what I can provide. When I expressed my frustration, they pressured me, telling me I was overreacting and just creating drama. They acted like my feelings were irrelevant and that I should be grateful to be part of the group, even though they only seem to value me when it’s convenient for them.

Now, I feel trapped and disrespected, stuck in a group that only contacts me when they need something and doesn’t value me as a true friend.

Am I the asshole for being so angry and calling them out for being fake friends?

Around a month or two ago, my mom asked me what I wanted to do for my birthday at a resturant.

Near the end of July my mom told me (without asking or confirming with me) that we were going to go to Tennessee for my birthday this year, and like usual, I could bring a friend.

I didn't have the energy for it. He asked if I wanted to play the new game I had. I said I wanted them to play the game they wanted and when they were finished, we could play the other one.

I played solitaire.

He gave me a list of things I could have done to join in and said I could have even told them they weren't allowed to play my game.

I know she has a love for language and this is genuinely just the way she talks. 
We have always struggled with communication where I am constantly lost as to what the point of the conversation is, getting lost in the hidden meanings and caught up on the large, older words used & when I ask a lot of clarifying questions, I’m seen as argumentative.

29,1engd18,AITA Missing my baby’s 1st scan,"Hi there.

About 2 weeks ago, on a visit to a hospital, my wife was offered a repeat visit to do the first viability pregnancy scan. The date offered was 9th of August which we agreed on. 5 minutes after leaving the doctors office I remembered that  few months prior I had booked a ticket to a music festival that happens on the same day.
I told me wife about it and suggested we should go back and re-book, however, she refused, saying its not a big deal, and because it’s the earliest possible appointment she doesn’t want to lose it.
I asked if she was sure about going alone and she said not to worry.

Prior to the hospital visit, we were discussing booking a private scan around the same time, plus one more in later stages of pregnancy as well, so to my mind at the time it wasn’t a big deal either - just an extra (peace of mind )scan.

Fast forward to today, and my wife is in tears saying that „I choose to go to this festival instead of hearing my first baby’s heartbeat”

Am I the asshole for deciding to stick with my plan and attend this festival?

My (24F) daughter (4F) goes to her grandparents house everyday that she’s with her dad so they can watch her to babysit while her dad works 

They put arm floaties and goggles on her when she gets in the pool and watch her from outside the pool.

I told them to stop putting them on her, because she is in swim classes and it causes delays and regressions in her skills and causes her to swim with unnatural skills. They told me it’s okay, it’s safer and they feel more comfortable having her in the pool that way.

I told them I take her to swim every week, and I see her regressing and struggling to be comfortable in the pool now without floaties or goggles when she normally is a very strong swimmer for her age and I’m not really asking. Her swimming instructor also agreed that using these can cause a regression in her swimming skills.

She said they don’t get in the pool and reiterated they feel more comfortable when she has these things with her, I said they should be in the pool with her regardless and either they can do that or I’d prefer her not to be in their pool unless she can be free in the pool with no goggles or floaties and she’ll have to wait until I or her father can be in the pool with her.

 Hi everyone, I (16)M am being forced to go to church by my parents (40)M, who I will name Bruce, and (39)F, who I will name Eva. Not real names My parents are very kind normally, and I love them to bits. However, things have been happening for the past months that have me deeply concerned.

  
For context, I am an atheist, and I genuinely don't believe in God, while my parents are both Christian. And for the longest time, this didn't really matter. we respected each other's beliefs and we never actually fought about it until recently. Eva has been getting more connected with her faith. I thought ""Great, she is learning about what she believes and deepening her connection to it."" Oh, boy I didn't know the half of it. It's started off slowly with Eva getting into philosophical debates with me as to why I don't believe. I did start to feel a little uncomfortable with this as it felt like she was trying to convert me. This kept happening until around a month back when this debate had escalated into an argument where Bruce told me outright that he was trying to convert me and that he needed to plant that ""seed of doubt into my mind."" I was saddened, having my suspicions confirmed made me feel icky about this whole topic.

  
I went to my room to decompress and let the shock of that revelation sink in. It then got worse when my mother started talking about how she wanted to get baptized. I decided to listen in on the conversation when I heard her say word for word, ""You don't have to believe to be baptized."" I didn't want to be baptized. I still don't; she later came to me asking, if I wanted to be baptized to ""support her."" I apologized but said no, I didn't. I felt guilty about denying it but with the recent behavior. Every single suggestion they brought up to me seemed like an attempt to convert me.

  
Last week she said she was forcing me to go to church. She didn't ask, I couldn't say no. She says she wants me there to support me but this is just another attempt to convert me to their faith.

My mom told me she wanted me to come to the recreational center with my her and my younger brother and walk around the track. I said I couldn't because I hadn't recovered fully from my reaction and my mom said ""that doesn't stop you from walking."" I said it did and she got pissy with me.

34,1enfrcq,AITA for telling my mom the truth?,"I hate all of this but oh my god. 

Okay so first things first, my mom isn’t my bio mom. My bio mom abandoned me 6 thousand years ago but I still have some memories of her. Specifically, the kind of soap that she used. Oh my goodness it smells so good. And, even though I resent her for leaving me, a little part of me likes the reminder of her. Of when I would hug her and be enveloped by a cloud of floral goodness. Anyway. 

I was talking to my mom while we were in the store getting soap and she was recommending me some lotion. She said she would buy it for me as long as I didn’t get the same scent as her, since I “already stole her signature soap”. 

I was at first confused and thought she was joking so I was like “huh? lol” and she was like “You know, the Dove soap” and I immediately was like “Oh I stole it from Jenna!” I was laughing cause I thought we had a friendly banter thing going on but she took it all the way wrong. She was like “oh.” all meekly and then threw the lotion into the basket. When we got home she went into her room and didn’t come back out until it was time for her to cook dinner. 

Here’s where I think I’m not the a-hole:
1. I didn’t know that she even used that soap, cause I don’t go into her bathroom and she usually wears lots of heavy perfumes. I’ve been using that soap for 3 years now and not once has she mentioned it before now. 

Here’s where I think I am the a-hole:
1. She has a lot of ill feelings towards Jenna because she was my dad’s affair partner. I think the idea that I would try to emulate her hurt her feelings. I do feel bad that I hurt her feelings. 
2. I could’ve played along and kept the true reasoning to myself but I just had to open my mouth. It wouldn’t have hurt for her to think that I was “stealing” (trying to emulate) her. ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-08,"AITA for telling my mom the truth? I hate all of this but oh my god.

I (34M) live with my fiancé (38F)

we’ve come to the understanding that since she has these kids and raised them a certain way that she is going to take the lead on the parenting aspect and just look to me as another person in the home.

My fiancé just last month had a long talk with me about how I need to be more present in the other children’s lives. I should be paying for their activities and school supplies and also doing one on one activities with them as well and that they see the connection I have with my son and that it affects them poorly. I said no problem but I fail to see why it’s my responsibility all of sudden when it has always been myself left out of that l responsibility 

She became very upset.. “they need a man in their life” and “it’s your job as a provider to provide” and “they are just kids, we are the adults” 

she said “if you truly loved me you would love these kids like your own”

Anyways the conversation rambled a bit longer and we came to the agreement I would help in anyway I could and agreed I would try and take a more proactive step to be in their lives. But it has been very hard to do the one on one activities since they know very little structure. Public places they know they can throw fits and get their way.

As far as the financial side, let me tell you. This back to school season has been devastating. I never thought this would be an issue. She was always so frugal with spending. I had a conversation with her and after going through the charges she said I was being controlling and financially holding her hostage.. I explained I just need more of a heads up or planning to be able to take on an expense

 I explained my frustrations with the new roles and that I’m trying to fill shoes that technically isn’t my responsibility and it just got worse from there. Ultimately I should have the capacity to care for additional kids even if they aren’t biologically mine and I think on some level I know that to be the truth. I think my biggest problem has been the switch from basically “they don’t need a dad” to the present expectation which is “they need a dad man up”

There is more to this. But I had to condense it way more then initially had it to meet the 3000 character requirement to post.

Being born and raised in those countries, I was excited to join the conversation about something I loved and knew a decent amount about. The issue began when I mentioned that the best fried rice, in my opinion, is Indonesian fried rice. I might have exaggerated a bit, but it was all about the flavors for me. 

Then, someone interjected, arguing that Indonesia wasn’t even the inventor of fried rice, insisting that China was. I was taken aback because I was merely talking about the taste, not the origins. What should have been a simple discussion turned into a ten-minute argument, with them accusing me of not having tried other fried rice variations (which I have). I tried to cool things down by saying, “In the end, it depends on our taste buds,” and the situation seemed to settle.

However, things escalated when they started making racist remarks. I called them out, but they didn’t stop. Some of my friends urged me to walk away, but I was really not having it—I knew they would keep going if I didn’t stand up to them. They even started sharing photos of Indonesian food they found unappealing, trying to make it a joke and pulling others into it. It went on for a while, and all I could do was remain silent and say that I wasn’t going to deal with it.

Then, someone asked me if I was really going to let it slide. At that point, after what felt like ages, I snapped and said, “I’m not wasting my time with these ‘braindead’ people.” My response took everyone by surprise, and I didn’t regret it at first.

41,1enewhc,AITA for shouting at my friend about road rules ,"
This happened a while ago but it still sits on my mind.

Me and my friend ‘Louise’ took a job teaching in Thailand last summer. Every morning we would get a tuktuk from our hotel to the school. It would drop us off on the opposite side of the road, it was a really rural town literally completely in the south of Thailand so there was no traffic ever and barely any cars / scooters. 

One day we get dropped, it was my turn to pay our driver so I pay, look both ways, see a scooter in the distance and begin crossing the road. Louise runs over to grab my arm and pull me back (Left side of the road, where the scooter was coming from) so that my body bangs into the tuktuk. The scooter ? stopped a good five meters near us mainly due to the fact it is a well known fact that this road has a school on, so the general public slows down.

I blow up at her as adrenaline instantly hits me. I was always taught that no matter what, do not pull someone in the direction of the traffic, if they’ve started crossing let them cross. I inform her of this.

I raised my voice once at her as she first grabbed me simply saying “What the hell are you doing”, as we were walking up to our workplace I quietened the volume to not cause a scene and try to calm myself down. I knew that, since there was no real danger, there was no point to overreact but with my heart still pacing from only experiencing being dragged back and hitting the tuktuk i still felt like informing her of how silly her action was. I told her that what she did was stupid and dangerous, that she put me at risk despite there not being any danger.

Her response ? To point a finger at me and say “you will not speak to me that way”, whilst i continued saying that what she did is dangerous she kept reiterating that she does not deserve to be shouted at for keeping me safe and that my behaviour is completely unreasonsable, that i’m being cruel and trying to manipulate her to believe she was wrong.

I told her we can talk about it later (as our work was starting) so let’s plan our lesson and then leave the school at lunchtime to discuss it privately, to which she agreed but the atmosphere remained hostile, in the end we never got it sorted.

so… AITA ?

tldr; friend pulled me into oncoming traffic (one slow scooter that was far away from us) causing me to bang into another vehicle.

Me and my friend ‘Louise’ took a job teaching in Thailand last summer. Every morning we would get a tuktuk from our hotel to the school. It would drop us off on the opposite side of the road, it was a really rural town literally completely in the south of Thailand so there was no traffic ever and barely any cars / scooters. 

One day we get dropped, it was my turn to pay our driver so I pay, look both ways, see a scooter in the distance and begin crossing the road. Louise runs over to grab my arm and pull me back (Left side of the road, where the scooter was coming from) so that my body bangs into the tuktuk. The scooter ? stopped a good five meters near us mainly due to the fact it is a well known fact that this road has a school on, so the general public slows down.

I blow up at her as adrenaline instantly hits me. I was always taught that no matter what, do not pull someone in the direction of the traffic, if they’ve started crossing let them cross. I inform her of this.

I raised my voice once at her as she first grabbed me simply saying “What the hell are you doing”, as we were walking up to our workplace I quietened the volume to not cause a scene and try to calm myself down. I knew that, since there was no real danger, there was no point to overreact but with my heart still pacing from only experiencing being dragged back and hitting the tuktuk i still felt like informing her of how silly her action was. I told her that what she did was stupid and dangerous, that she put me at risk despite there not being any danger.

Her response ? To point a finger at me and say “you will not speak to me that way”, whilst i continued saying that what she did is dangerous she kept reiterating that she does not deserve to be shouted at for keeping me safe and that my behaviour is completely unreasonsable, that i’m being cruel and trying to manipulate her to believe she was wrong.

I told her we can talk about it later (as our work was starting) so let’s plan our lesson and then leave the school at lunchtime to discuss it privately, to which she agreed but the atmosphere remained hostile, in the end we never got it sorted.

so… AITA ?

tldr; friend pulled me into oncoming traffic (one slow scooter that was far away from us) causing me to bang into another vehicle. Adrenaline caused me to get angry, her only response was that I cannot speak to her in such a way",0.0,0.9939409494400024,1,0
42,1endvx0,AITA for asking my in-laws to respect my way of being the way that I respect theirs?,"I did not grow up in a shiny happy vacation family that ate dinner together and sang on car rides or anything. I didn’t have cousins sleepovers, Christmas traditions or whatever. And because of that, I am a lot more quiet, internal, etc than my spouse’s family. 

They are the polar opposite. People stop by at their home unannounced and they’re welcomed with open arms. There are so many kids running around all the time laughing and playing and the adults watching them warmly with love. They all share secrets and stories and are very huggy and all that. And they’ve been super welcoming to me but have started to be very pushy when it comes to some things.

For example at a dinner recently one of the kids wanted to show us the song she learned. Everyone sang along together. I sat quietly and listened. Spouse’s aunt kept elbowing me to join in. I smiled and clapped for her but did not sing. 

That same day, one of the younger kids was going around hugging everyone goodbye. I stooped down and gave her a high five and she toddled off. The mom told me that was weird and to just hug the kid.

Well. A bunch of the women my age were planning a girls only camping trip and talking all about all the fun and girly things they want to do, all of the bonding experiences they wanted. I am not interested, so I declined politely but did say they could use our camping supplies. 

The organizer got frustrated and roped in my MIL, both of them teamed up on me that they’re trying on their end to get me to open up and be part of the family more. I said that was so nice of them, but that I have opened up a LOT and they need to understand that it all goes two ways. I have given in so much and they know a lot more than I ever wanted, I’ve done a lot of things with group events, one on ones, shopping, getting hair done, wedding stuff, etc. I would have preferred strongly to just not do any of it but I knew it was a give and take thing and challenged myself to open up.

I explained this and said I appreciate them and I know it’s difficult for them, but reminded them that it’s difficult for me as well, and I’m trying as hard as I can. My therapist and I work on this all the time.

This really bothered my MIL and she went to my husband to complain. He defended me and told her that I’ve done nothing wrong. He reiterated this to me as well and said that he thinks I have done a LOT more than he expected me to and he’s proud of me. 

But it didn’t sit well with MIL, who reached out to tell me that she was upset that after 8 years, I still treat them like we aren’t family. But to me, I do treat them as family.

46,1enczjd,AITA for lashing out at my sister when she thinks she's helping,"So, I can understand if I immediately seem like the asshole based on the title, but there is context to it.

I, [M 17], have grown fed up with my, [F 15], sister to the point where I exploded on her. 

My entire family loves videogames, and therefore we are all constantly playing a video games (sometimes separately, sometimes together). My dad especially likes playing videogames on the TV so that we, the rest of the family, can watch. I really enjoy watching him play, and coming with suggestions whenever prompted, but lately I've been unable without becoming quite agitated. My youngest sister also shares suggestions like I do, but I cannot say the same about my other sister [F 15]. 

She constantly bombards anyone playing with ""suggestions"" that are more akin to commands, and I cannot take it any more. It is always: ""Go to the right"", ""No, don't do that. Do _this_ instead"", ""Ah, you need to do _this_ and _that_ to unlock *spoiler*"", ect. And it is so extremely frustrating, having someone constantly clinging onto you like a leech, draining you of fun and energy as she tells you what to do whilst spoiling any secret or event. 
I used to love playing puzzle games, but now I am unable to play anymore as they always remind me of my sister. I appreciate _suggestions_ when I appear to be stuck on a certain puzzle or stage while playing, but not when I'm being straight up told the solution to it unprompted.
 I am not even able to play games like Stardew Valley or Minecraft without her constantly backseating me, even when there's no 'set solution'. 

If I try to tell her to stop, she begins her entire guilt trip scheme, muttering apologies over and over again as she cries crocodile tears, pulling her knees up to her chest and curling up. She will wallow in her own sadness for 5-10 minutes before returning back to spewing commands. I have asked her politely too many times to keep track, and naturally grown quite fed up with her shallow apologies.

 Yesterday I had enough of her, and I blew up on her, yelling at her and telling her exactly how I felt. This resulted in her crying and storming off to sob to our mother. I could easily eavesdrop, not even on purpose, hearing her cry about how ""I hate her, and [that] she is a horrible person who never should have been born,"". All of that is false and utter lies, nothing like anything I may have screamed at her while furious. 
I have had enough of this bullshit, and now I refuse to be anywhere near my sister while playing/watching games. 
Only thing is that I fear that I may have been the asshole in this situation, and henceforth I have come to consult the people of Reddit's opinion.

I (15F) started a new school in April last school year so I didn’t really have a lot of time to make new friends before summer. I ended up sitting at lunch next to a boy named Kyle (16M) who wasn’t sitting with anyone either. He’s a little weird and turns out he’s autistic, but I didn’t want to eat alone so I saw he had a space camp tshirt on and asked him if it was fun.  Space and astronomy are something he is like obsessed with so he told me all about space camp and then started talking about other space stuff and it was actually kind of nice because I didn’t have to say much and it was interesting plus he was really excited to talk about it, so win-win.  We sat together most lunches until school was out and talked a little over the summer so we’re friends now I guess.

He’s in a couple of my classes this year so even though I have other friends now we still hang out.  He invited me this weekend to come over for dinner and see his new telescope that he got for his birthday. It sounded fun so I went and met his parents and they seemed really happy that he had a friend over.  Like his mom was super clear that I can come hang out anytime I want. The telescope is pretty neat, he can control it with his laptop so we got to see some nebulas and different things. I had to go home since it was getting late and Kyle’s dad said he would drop me off since it’s just like 10 minutes away and he was going to grab a couple things from the store anyway. I let my parents know and they said it was ok.

Kyle’s dad was doing the dad chat while we were in the car and then said it was really nice of me to be friends with Kyle and asked if we were dating. I thought he was just teasing me so I laughed and said no.  And then it got really weird because he was like trying to talk me into dating Kyle and said if I’d take him to the homecoming formal he’d pay for everything and a little extra. I didn’t know what to say because it was creeping me out so I just laughed and then we got to my house so I said thanks and went inside fast.

I wasn’t going to tell anyone but my dad figured out that something was wrong so he came and asked me if everything went ok for real and I told him about Kyle’s dad. He said  not to worry about it and that I don’t have to date anyone or go to a dance with anyone if I don’t want to.

Kyle was out of school Monday and Tuesday and yesterday he was looking really bad and like he was avoiding me so I asked him if he had been sick.  He said his parents had been fighting ever since Sunday about something his dad said to me and it made him so upset and nervous that he couldn’t come to school.  So my parents must have talked to his parents about what happened and now I feel like I messed up because it caused a big deal and hurt Kyle and I know it was a big thing for him to have a friend over and now he feels really bad about it.

Edit: Thank you for all the responses and advice.  I talked to my parents about it last night and they did talk to Kyle’s mom. Kyle’s mom said she would take care of it and it would never happen again. My parents don’t want me to go over to Kyle’s house again but they said that Kyle could come here if I want while they’re home or maybe they could take us out to a museum or something sometime if I feel ok about it.

We’ve always been close even though we aren’t very alike. She’s always been sheltered and is pretty religious.

50,1enct47,AITA for not apologizing?,"Long post but needs context: Some friends and I (M 20), have a whatsapp group chat where we organize ourselves to go to concerts and music festivals, something we like to do often.

We recently added a new person, a friend (M 19) we met at one of these concerts, I'll call him Jack.

Jack and one of my long-time friends, I'll call him Brian (M 20), were chatting in the group about going to an event next month, but the ticket price hadn't been announced yet.

Jack warned that if the price was too high he wouldn't go, and Brian said he would go regardless of the price, paying up to 300 bucks for the ticket.

On the day the tickets were released, Jack sent a photo of the ticket purchase screen in the group, telling Brian that they had been released and that the price was too high (around 250 bucks).

After 5 minutes Brian sent a screenshot saying he had bought the ticket and asked if Jack had bought it too, Jack said he hadn't, and that he had said that if it was too expensive he wouldn't go.

Brian said it was fine in the group chat, but he texted me privately and told me to kick Jack from the group because he had left him hanging and made him waste money...

I ""defended"" Jack by saying that he'd already said he wouldn't go if it was too expensive, and I laughed it off by sending Brian a screenshot of his own message saying that he'd pay up to 300 and now he wanted to kick Jack from the group for it...

Brian said he didn't find the situation funny and said I was defending a new person instead of taking his side, whom I've known for a long time and has left the group chat and no longer wants to talk to me...

I thought about apologizing but after thinking about it, I don't think I have any reason to apologize, I think Brian screwed up by buying the ticket without checking with anyone first and he's angry with everyone else because of his own doing (?), he thinks that because I laughed at the situation I was laughing at him for losing money, but I just found his irony funny.

He says Jack induced him to buy by sending him the ticket purchase screen, but I said he only sent that screen to show him the price.

I think that if I apologize, Brian will think he's right to be angry and won't learn anything, continuing to behave in a childish way, but I don't want to lose a friend I really like...

She, let's call her Rose, has always said that she has really good people skills and she pretty much knows anything about anyone. We talked for a while and she started to talk about a very good friend of mine, let's call him Alex. She didn't say anything mean about him or anything, but she told me that he was probably gay (which I do not care about by the way).

Today, we were studying together and the topic of ""drama"" got brought up in the conversation.

Alex then asked if she also had some drama about him, which I responded to with ""Well, you're someone, so yeah"". After a while Rose just told Alex that she thought he was gay, which Alex just denied. We got back to studying until Alex left because he was heading home for the day.

After Alex has left, Rose immediately calls me out and says that I shouldn't have said that she also had some drama about him. I didn't think much of it when I said it. She said that she felt uncomfortable saying that to his face, and that he was actually gay, but didn't know it himself yet, etc. After the whole Alex-drama was kinda settled, which I do feel bad about, she starts to say that this isn't the first time that I've done this to her.

My dad passed away a short while ago. He had his little truck that he loved- nothing flashy just a 2007 Chevy Colorado. He never really cared about or bought new cars so when he bought this almost new, it was a big deal. He took great care of it and only drove it 130,000 miles.

When he passed, my mother was feeling stressed out from all the bills coming in and considered selling the truck but I told her not to- as we would need it to haul and move things and it's something that belongs in the family. She agreed and said that she would just give it to me for being such a big help with things.

However, after the move, she informed that her brother offered her $1500 for the truck and she didn't have any use for it. I told her that she could probably get at least 5k but he promised he would keep it and if she ever needed to use it, she could have it.

I wasn't worried about her giving it to me, as I already have 2 vehicles. I just didn't want to see it go.

She sells it and couple months pass and my mom visits my uncle and the truck isn't there. He told her that he fixed a bunch of stuff on it and ended up selling it for 4K. But probably broke even after parts and labor.

For context: I,(f25) was born in the Philippines and my mom (f54)had to leave me with my grandparents in my homeland while she go abroad. My mom was a single mom at that time, or so I thought. 

Fast forward when I was 8 years old, I moved to Canada with a huge surprise. Her boyfriend, now stepfather (m58) lived with us in a small condo. I hated that man with a passion. He is beyond racist and misogynist. He refuse to cook and clean and expects all the women to do it. That manchild also forbids us to speak on our mother tongue.
 
At 9 y.o, my beloved brother was born. We are now super close to each other and tell each other about everything, despite our 10 year age gap. 
At this age, I noticed the man child does not improve his behaviour towards to us. I don’t remember him changing a diaper or washing the dishes. This made me despise my mother as well because she tolerated this behaviour and then had a child with a man child. This issue has caused our relationship as a mother and daughter to drift apart because my mother was incredibly bitter towards to me for refusing to clean for him. I refuse to do anything for him, and I respect myself enough. At 18, she kicked me out because I was being disrespectful. 

I am now 25 and doing well. Last night, my aunt texted me that my mother’s marriage is failing and she did not come home for 5 days. Apparently, my stepfather had said that he wants to work out the marriage because he feels sad for her, she doesn’t have money to support herself, he is too good for her, and she should be friends with only québécois and not Filipino.  

Am I wrong for not sympathizing enough? My family and boyfriend are telling me to be more understanding and to sympathize with her. I really don’t see my future with my mother what she did to me.


Please note that my mom and I don’t have anything to reconnect. All I remember was the physical and emotional pain she had caused me. I would love to type all the things she did to me but I’m afraid my post will be removed.

 I (29f) & my partner (33) can't seem to agree on who was the asshole in the chainsaw incident.  So,  back story - we needed to cut down a tree from our yard, it was a widespread invasive species where I live.  We decided to do it ourselves,  as with most things around the house. - edit,  can't afford groceries much less a professional tree trimmer - Now,  I have very little experience with a chainsaw,  like used one twice in my life before this incident with zero proper training. My partner decided to let me have a go of it,  with no issues at first.  Then our new neighbor (neither of us had ever had a conversation with this man before and we are both severely introverted and anxious around other people) decided to come over and tell us about how we were doing it wrong - edit- it was more of an explanation on chainsaws themselves than actual education in how to handle the tool,  because we had a lot of trouble starting the chainsaw, figured I'd let my partner fill me in in a minute since it was currently running -. I decided not to entertain this Rando and went back to cutting the tree, leaving my poor defenseless partner stuck in a conversation with this dude. My back was turned to them and I couldn't hear them over the power tool.

AITA for *Almost* cutting my partner with a chainsaw? 

 I (29f) & my partner (33) can't seem to agree on who was the asshole in the chainsaw incident.  So,  back story - we needed to cut down a tree from our yard, it was a widespread invasive species where I live.  We decided to do it ourselves,  as with most things around the house. - edit,  can't afford groceries much less a professional tree trimmer - Now,  I have very little experience with a chainsaw,  like used one twice in my life before this incident with zero proper training. My partner decided to let me have a go of it,  with no issues at first.  Then our new neighbor (neither of us had ever had a conversation with this man before and we are both severely introverted and anxious around other people) decided to come over and tell us about how we were doing it wrong - edit- it was more of an explanation on chainsaws themselves than actual education in how to handle the tool,  because we had a lot of trouble starting the chainsaw, figured I'd let my partner fill me in in a minute since it was currently running -. I decided not to entertain this Rando and went back to cutting the tree, leaving my poor defenseless partner stuck in a conversation with this dude. My back was turned to them and I couldn't hear them over the power tool. So I'm doing my thing for a minute, and this is where it might be pertinent to mention that I am severely susceptible to jump scares with an overactive fight/ flight/ fawn/ freeze response,  and I absolutely hate being touched.-Edit, yes i have PTSD - This is well known and documented amongst the 2 people that know me.

59,1enbk2n,WIBTA For reporting my upstairs neighbor to property management for excessively running the shower?,"
I'll start by saying I (28 M) prefer to mind my own business when it comes to neighbors. I've lived in appartments for my entire adult life and I've had all varieties of frustrating people in the units around me. When I have an issue, normally I just leave it be. That's just a part of living so close to others and I'm not looking to get someone kicked out. Rent is too high these days to risk impacting someone's entire life over my personal annoyance. However, this situation is a bit unique.
 
Up front I will clarify that I live in the Midwest. So water scarcity is not really a part of the problem. Also, our landlord pays for water as a ""perk"".

My partner and I noticed a few months ago that the unit above us runs their shower for multiple hours at odd times of the day. I've seen other posts on this sub mentioning roommates showering for 2-3 hours (which I already think is excessive) but this is a whole other level. We have noticed they will leave it on over night, or for hours during the day. As I am writing this, their shower has been running for the past 20 hours without stopping! Which might be the longest we have noticed. I know it was 20 hours because we ran into our neighbor in the elevator yesterday after work and they immediately turned it on when they got into their unit. It has not be turned off since then, unless they maybe turned it off between midnight and 6am and then immediately back on again.

Now this does not really affect us much. It's just a mild sound of running water, not a big deal. That said, there are 3 specific reasons I am thinking of reporting them. 1: I am an environmentally conscious person and this level of waste is upseting to me. 2: I am SO curious what they are using all of that water for! We have speculated at the possible reasons for it, but nothing seems to make sense for the size of apartment, shear amount of water, and why it would still sound like it's all going down the shower drain. Maybe if we report it, there is a chance we could get some answers. Our leasing office tends to be very casual about responding to tickets. So they might actually share what happens when they look into it.

Finally, for the most important reason I am considering this at all. 3: We hate our upstairs neighbor. I won't go into too many of the details for fear of breaking the rules of this sub. To put it briefly, he is a terrible person to his partner, and we can hear his rage issues very clearly once or twice a week. I don't need a reddit post to confirm it, he IS an asshole.

So all of that in mind, WIBTA for reporting such a weird issue?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-08,"WIBTA For reporting my upstairs neighbor to property management for excessively running the shower?

61,1enb4j8,AITA for 'comparing my grandfather to a dog',"I (19M) am on holiday in a third world country and am staying at my grandparents house. I was out last night visiting some relatives and we saw a dog there which they had named Charlie. I took a photo and a video of the dog. Today I sat down to speak to my grandfather and showed him the dog we saw last night, saying that it was named Charlie. He said (keep in mind this conversation is in another language): 'How could you name a dog Charlie?' And I responded: 'What were they meant to name him then? (Grandfather's name)?'

Then he got super mad saying that I compared him to a dog, and started shouting and insulting me, then told me to leave the room.

I have never seen him so mad before and my grandma came to my room and started scolding me saying that anyone would be offended by this, etc and she hasn't scolded me before so I'm thinking maybe I crossed the line, even if it was by accident.

Now I'm not sure if I was in the wrong, I didn't mean to offend him at all, I just responded because I was a little surprised by him saying that a dog can't be named Charlie and by default said what were they meant to name him and used his name as an example. It easily could've been my name or anyone else's name. I just used his name because he was the one that I was responding to.

62,1enaxsn,AITA for asking my daughter to temporarily move out??,"Throwaway account so I can get some advice on this situation. When I was a young adult my parents got into an awful car crash which resulted in their death. I was heartbroken, I was an only child so they left everything to me which included their house. Me and my long term girlfriend at the time moved into the house, it’s a 2 story and a 3 bedroom house. I started a job which I became really successful in, my family doesn’t come from wealth but I as of right now would consider myself pretty wealthy. At the start of my career my girlfriend fell pregnant and we had our first son and we got married and just kept building our family from there. I as of right now have 5 kids. 3 who are living with me (17f), (9m) and (6f). As much as I’ve loved staying in my parents house it’s became very crowded and so recently I just brought a new house with a room for all of my children along with some guest bedrooms, it’ll be almost a year before I’m able to move into our new home. My wife came to me and told me she’s pregnant which came as a shock to us both because we didn’t plan for more kids, we agreed to keep it but her due date comes before our house is ready to move into. Me and my wife had a long discussion about our daughter who I’ll call Amy which we eventually brought to Amy. I asked Amy how she would feel about moving into a apartment temporarily, I told her I’d cover all the costs of her living expenses and she could move back in a year once our new home was ready unless she wanted to stay in her apartment and if that was the case I’d support her until she’s ready to support herself. Amy was not happy at all and she screamed at us, she said she wasn’t ready to live on her own and how we’re prioritizing our new children over her. I tried to calm her down and reminded her it’s not permanent she’d move in the apartment that’s 5 minutes away from us and we’d still be parents to her but that the house is getting too crowded for another child and how her younger siblings already share a room. She’s now been avoiding us ever since, my wife believes we did nothing wrong but my oldest child said we were crazy to even consider that as a option. I just need to know how to go about this? Is there any other ways I could fix this? Am I wrong for even bringing this idea up to her? I truly just need advice on this situation. 

edit: I wanted to state that I AM NOT KICKING AMY OUT!! That would’ve never been the case at all. Amy is a soon to be college student who has stated that it’s hard for her to work in crowded environments which is why I suggested the idea of moving into a apartment of her own until we have the space but if it’s not something she wants it’s not something we will do. Amy will be 18 in oct but please stop assuming I’m neglecting my children, I’m simply just looking for a solution for 3 months until we move into our new house. I’m only suggesting this idea now because as I’ve stated before she’s going to college and has also stated that it was hard to get through school with her siblings and when they were newborns too. 

second edit: My daughter found this post and is ready to talk with me, I will update later tonight. 

UPDATE: 
My daughter found this post and we had a long discussion, she even asked me to write the update instead so here she is.

Hi guys! I’ll stick to the name that was given to me in the post and call myself Amy. I’m very active in the reddit community and so is some of my friends. I was talking to one of my friends who came across this post and read it. i came to my dad to talk about it and we read through some of the comments.

First thing I’d like to say as some of you guys suggested, The conversation my dad had with me was very poorly worded. I thought my dad was presenting me with this as if I didn’t have a choice which I know now is not the case. I was so surprised to see all of the comments accusing my dad of being this terrible human being which is not the case. During our conversation he explained how he didn’t feel like he was in the right space when presenting the conversation to me, he felt overworked, and stressed out about everything, as the same with my mom. He said he knew there were other situations to this issue but as he’s said recently i’ve expressed that I don’t work well in crowded environments which actually made me tear up because I feel like my parents are the only ones who really remember those small details about me. He said he felt like with a newborn in the house and me starting college that I would want my own space. He also reminded me that it wouldn’t be a permanent thing if that’s not what I wanted. he then asked me how this situation made me feel, i was honest and told him i didn’t know how to feel, i felt hurt and couldn’t understand why he wanted me gone, i did feel like i was being replaced and it all started to dawn on me that im growing up and that was was part of the reason for my freak out. I also freaked out because i felt like I wasn’t ready to not have my parents to do everything with especially my mom. He said he didn’t even think of that possibility until posting to reddit and apologized profusely. He also saw a comment about getting a camper in the backyard and suggested that to me but the whole time he reminded me it’s my choice and that I don’t have to do anything I’m not completely comfortable with. We decided that I’d be staying in a camper in the backyard when school starts, my boyfriend also agreed to be my study buddy! For everyone that was so quick to attack my dad for making a mistake, I hope you get help you need for assuming everything about my dad’s character based off this one post because he’s really not like that. He’s really the best dad I could ask for and me and him are very close as are me and my mom. Just because some of your parents don’t make mistake you don’t have a good home life doesn’t mean bring it here. Have a good day guys!

63,1enaeum,AITA for not buying my cousin something to eat when we went to the beach?,"EDIT 2: My cousin was not singled out. My kids have also had to share meals until they could finish a meal by themselves. My cousin has been out with us plenty of times and has also seen my kids share meals either with me and my partner or between themselves. I've always gotten my cousin her own meals but I was tired of food going to waste. My cousin is simply spoiled and has a mom who never tells her no to anything. But I don't do that with my own kids, so I won't do it with her. She gets treated the same as my own kids do.

I offered to take my cousin because she's around the same age as my kids and they get along great, so I thought it would be fun. While we were there, we went out to eat. My cousin is extremely picky and anytime I buy her food while we're out or cook anything, she takes a few bites and throws the rest away. I told her I was not buying her any food and that her and I could share something and she could have as much of it as she'd like. Well she didn't like that because I got my kids their own meals (which they ate all of). We ended up sharing anyways and she like I thought, she took a few bites and then said she was full.Thwe rest of the day was fine. Well flash foward to after I drop her back home.

64,1en99u0,AITA to choose a different college than my highschool GF?,"My parents are insisting I go to a different college than my girlfriend, partly because they don’t like her due to past issues (we broke up once because she was toxic, but we’re back together now and it's kinda ok we dated for a year and a half). I’m also interested in this college because it has a better reputation for the degree I want, and my best friend of 10 years will be there, which makes me happy. My girlfriend says our relationship won’t work if we go to different colleges, even though these are in-state schools in Louisiana and the distance isn’t that far compared to long-distance relationships across the states.

My parents will only support my tuition if I go to their chosen college, and I don’t have any in-state scholarships, so I’d be in a tough spot financially if I chose a different school. During a conversation with my girlfriend, I pointed out that she doesn’t trust herself, or me, when she worries about us being at different colleges.

My parents are insisting I go to a different college than my girlfriend, partly because they don’t like her due to past issues (we broke up once because she was toxic, but we’re back together now and it's kinda ok we dated for a year and a half). I’m also interested in this college because it has a better reputation for the degree I want, and my best friend of 10 years will be there, which makes me happy. My girlfriend says our relationship won’t work if we go to different colleges, even though these are in-state schools in Louisiana and the distance isn’t that far compared to long-distance relationships across the states.

My parents will only support my tuition if I go to their chosen college, and I don’t have any in-state scholarships, so I’d be in a tough spot financially if I chose a different school.

65,1en99fi,AITA for not accompanying my niece to kids' playgrounds?,"I (23M) am currently visiting my sister (34F) alongside a few of my other siblings. We visit every few months and stay at her place for a week or two to catch up and spend some time with her daughter (2F).

They often go to places catering to kids, think Chuck E Cheese & playgrounds, for my niece to play in. I've only gone on a few of these trips to know they're not for me. I don't like to be in places with lots of screaming kids running around, so when they go I tend to stay home. If they go to any other place with my niece I'm completely fine accompanying them.

My sister is very visibly upset that I'm not sacrificing and willing to go to these places for my niece since my niece asks if I'm going with them every time, and she thinks I'm disregarding her feelings. She always unpromptedly (in the middle of random conversations) says that I'm hurting her by not going.

At first, I gave in to the pressure and went, but took my laptop and noise-canceling headphones and sat working (freelance) in the parents' waiting area after playing with my niece for a few minutes. I later learned that this also upset her, because I wasn't there fully even though I played and talked to my niece all the way there and back, before and after she was done playing.

She's the type of person to not communicate directly. She either makes snarky remarks or talks about me behind my back to people I trust who tell me what she said. In addition, she previously 'punished' me (5 months ago, still ongoing) by not sending me photos & videos of my niece anymore because my replies to her videos weren't as 'expressive' (few emojis, etc...) or were a few days late because I get busy and can't respond to every detail in +25 videos each a minute and a half long.

Today, I said no and my other sibling (31F) has told me that I need to go with them this time because she's leaving & going home in 2 days, and wants me to spend time with her. I said I couldn't handle being in kids' places because they're too noisy and chaotic for me, and she said I could go work in a nearby cafè, but I'd rather save myself the money & stay home working because I would be completely by myself at the cafè until they were done and we'd head home immediately.

I don't tell them to change destinations. Whenever they say we're heading to X, and X is a playground for kids, I simply say I'm not going.

66,1en984q,AITAH for getting in an argument with my bf for not speaking English around me?,"
My bf is having company over for the next two days. I am American, and they are from a Slavic country. 

I asked him that when I’m around if they can speak English. I am trying to learn his language on my own but me makes no effort to help me learn it. I just find it polite as I would like to be included and know what is said.

I talked to him about this multiple times. I’m not saying everything needs to be said in English, but at least some. 

Yesterday his friend was speaking a bit of English, but this morning that all went out the window. They started chatting in their tongue when I was around them, and I had no idea what they were talking about. I guess my bfs friend asked a question and then he just translated it to ask me a question. 

I grew frustrated as I ask my bf to take the initiative with this. 

I’ve been very accommodating so far. 
We are in the middle of moving. I had to move a lot of stuff yesterday by myself and come back to our current apartment to clean and cook. 

This visit was very last minute. My bf didn’t help with anything. I gave up my spot in the bed and slept in the guest room. I made two large ribeye, potatoes, homemade bread, and guest commented he didn’t like his steak cooked the way I did it.

I think I’ve been more than accommodating. I just asked for them to speak a little more English around me so I won’t feel excluded. I feel it’s just the right thing. 

He says he likes to speak his native language, and I understand that. It’s more comfortable. But he speaks it all the time. And his friend speaks English very well, it’s not that it’s an issue with him.

67,1en97vk,WIBTAH if I chose to go to my dance selection test instead of helping my dad with my autistic brother?,"This is just happened so I really need quick advice. 

I (23nb) am undergoing a type of audition to be able to attend 4 months of free dance classes. I had danced before, it is something that I love to do and helps me cope with many of my mental issues, but unfortunately I wasn't able to do it since 2020.

Now, I live with my father (51m), stepmom (47f) and stepbrother (12m). I work part time and go to college,  so I'm usually busy, but I try to make time to spend with my family. I'm saying all of that because just half an hour ago my stepmom told me she's undergoing a minor surgery (nothing death threatening) in about 4 hours, and asked me if I could go home right after work so I could help my father with my brothers nightly routine. The thing is: if I do this, I won't be able to go to the audition, and could possibly loose my chance of going back to dancing. I also don't know how much of help I could be, since I'm also autistic (in a much lighter assistance level than my brother) and my brother's meltdown make me extremely stressed an sometimes even nonverbal. I also don't have any way of contacting the dance teachers.

Had I been told this before, I would have talked to the teacher on Tuesday (1st audition class) and sorted things out. Also, my dad and stepmom have a housekeepers, several caretakers, my brothers grandparents leave 2 blocks away and... Well, my dad is still there.

I asked my gf about what I should do and she said health and family come in first place. I asked my mom, and she asked me if my dad was that incompetent that he couldn't take care of his own kid by himself, and if my stepmom was willing to pay for my dance classes in case I loose this chance over not attending today.

So I'm split. Will I be the AH if I choose to attend the dance audition?

EDIT: Just to correct that my brother is my halfbrother, not a stepbrother. Same dad, different moms. English is not my first language and I was very anxious when I wrote this

SMALL UPDATE: Thanks for everyone that answered! I was genuinely feeling bad for wanting to attend my classes, but wanted you to know that it's going to happen :)

To clarify somethings about the housekeeper/caretakers:

 1) the plural in housekeeper was a spelling mistake, it's just one; 

2) the caretakers don't stay the entire day at my father's house, nor they stay all together at once. The thing is, my stepmom (and dad) is an university teacher that specializes in care for autistic children, so these caretakers are usually her former/current college students that take the opportunity to get some money and experience by working for her. It's usually 1 caretaker a day during something like 3h, helping him serve his dinner and then shower 

So, I didn't wanted to stress my stepmom even more, so I messaged my dad asking if he could at least take me to the dance classes after I helped him care for my brother. He said he didn't knew I had the classes starting so close to the time he needed to be helped, refused politely my gfs offer to go help him and called my brother's aunt and her husband. And that was it. 

My stepmom will have to rest for a bit and my brother is usually really demanding of her attention. I don't have any classes tomorrow morning, so I'll just help my dad out on Friday before heading to work.

That's all. Wish me luck in the audition!

68,1en93r6,AITA for Demanding my Husband Come Home Early from the Casino?,"One of my husband's only hobbies is playing poker. We recently moved back in with both our parents for my graduate school research opportunities (we have a room at both homes, and they live about 10 mins from each other). Where we used to live, he would play poker every Saturday night. This never bothered me, but I noticed sometimes he would leave what I thought was excessively early (5pm) and come back as late as 9am. He would sleep the entire next day. While this annoyed me, as I felt our time together was considerably shorted by him sleeping in the next day, leaving me with all the household responsibilities (we have 4 dogs), I tried to be easy going about it, only giving him trouble if I wanted to have dinner with him before he left or if I had something planned on Sunday. He always obliged but I couldn't help but think he would leave as early as possible if given the choice. He has a dedicated bank roll that he plays with, and we currently keep our finances totally separate as we have since we were dating. I should also mention that he is responsible with money, always contributing to his savings, HSAs, stocks, etc. I am a graduate student and live off loans, and he managed to pay all our bills while i've been in school. It is worth mentioning though that he LOVES shopping, and there is usually at least one amazon package at the door every day. I kept him off my Amazon prime account for a while but when we moved he asked for the password, and he's been ordering a lot since, sending things to my parents' house so his parents wouldn't see how many packages he is getting. He also plans to not look for a new job for a few months as he wants to take a break since moving. I don't really blame him, and to me, as long as he's not in the red or has credit card debt, I don't really have a say as to how he spends his money. But now that we have moved back, he and I have spent every day together. Without telling me, he accepted an offer from a nearby casino for 5 days comped room. He told me a couple days before he left that he booked this and that he was planning to be gone M-F. AITA for being super annoyed about this??

For some context my sister (29f) we will call her Pen has always had some mental issues, but I have never treated her any different than our two older siblings. Because of her mental issues she gets upset easily and always starts drama, (been that way since we were kids). About 8 years ago she started seeing this guy, let's call him Chad. Chad doesn't know how to read or write, does not take care of himself, and barely talks; when he does talk it\`s so quiet and you can hardly hear what he is saying, because he mumbles. I know for a fact that Chad has emotionally and quite possibly physically abused Pen.

 They had three children that have since been taken away by child protective services and are now adopted by a nice family. Chad was the reason Pen never got them back. Chad never took care of the kids and told lies to CPS about Pen. Since Christmas of 2019 we have not invited Chad to any of our family get togethers, and Pen knows that we don\`t want Chad around our family. Despite all that Chad has done to Pen and our family she still chooses him over us.

 So now to the reason I'm posting to Reddit. Like I said I am getting married in September and it is currently August. Back in June Pen started asking what they needed to wear to the wedding, where and when it was. I had previously told Pen to wait for the invite but since she asked again, I told her she was the only one we were inviting. And as expected Pen blew up at me stating ""I'm not coming for BS, I know it\`s because I'm pregnant again."" Mind you Pen does this every time Chad is not invited, and none of us care that she is pregnant.

 The last three charismas\` Pen cursed us all out saying she isn't coming, then shows up Christmas day as if nothing happened (it\`s always like this). I responded respectfully and told Pen that if that was her decision I will remove her from the list, as well as provided her with where she could watch the ceremony via live stream if she wanted.

71,1en8pzh,AITA for not looking after my sisters dog so she can go to a wedding?,"So basically my sister needs me to look after her dog in a few weeks, she asked me a while back before I went into a new job and I said that I can’t guarantee anything yet but I’ll see what I can do. 

I work every other weekend and live away from home where I grew up where all my family and friends are apart from my sister who lives fairly close by to where I do. 

Fast forward to today I’ve found out I’m not working the Saturday she asked me to look after her dog but it’s the only free weekend for me to go back home in over 2 months and i need to collect a suitcase and some other things from there whilst I’m back before I go on holiday with my partner a couple weekends after. (Weekend after I’m working, weekend after that we go on holiday) 

Now on her end she’s a bridesmaid at a wedding and has enquired to kennels but as her dog hasn’t had the kennel cough vaccine (£250) they won’t have him. She doesn’t seem to know anybody else either to look after him.

She asked me to look after him from 4pm-7pm Saturday but if I leave after that I’ll get home for around 10/11pm unpack sleep have part of Sunday then have to set off in the evening again to get back. 

So that’s pretty much the run down, torn between what to do no full decisions are made yet.

72,1en8pgo,WIBTA if i refused to go to my cousin’s wedding?,"so my cousin and her boyfriend have been together since december and are getting married soon. 

she’s a year older than me, and we were pretty much raised together as our family all live in the same area. we were very close when we were younger but as we got to secondary school we’ve been very up and down. her and her friends bullying me, years-long fights but the worst of all of it is the way she will happily put me or my sister down in front of anyone else to make herself look good.

i know it’s her life and all that but i really can’t help thinking she’s making some giant, glaring mistakes. she’s 20 and her fiance now i guess is 22. neither of them have a job. she dropped out of school so has neither an english or maths qualification. they have nowhere to live and are leaving pregnancy down to chance which i unfortunately was told about by her in graphic detail. 

my uncle and aunt both leech off of my mother for money, regularly asking for £50 or more. 

so on hearing about the wedding from my parents, my immediate thought was that i wasn’t going. my reasons for this are: the fact that she’s entirely okay with slagging me off to make herself look good, the fact that she’s probably going to end up leeching off of me when she inevitably gets pregnant and has no way to fund her life or her child’s because she will not get a job, and in general i don’t want to spend hours wearing something i don’t like with people i don’t like.

the main memory of them both that sticks out to me is the time they dragged me out late at night drinking with them, and spent almost the entire time talking crap about my sister. her boyfriend hadn’t even met my sister at this point.

His child’s mother was civil to me at first but her attitude towards me has become increasingly more ugly. It’s at the point where she is just nasty towards me now.   As a result, she and I rarely speak to one another.  When I do have to directly address her, I call her by her full first name - not the nickname everyone calls her (ex. Jennifer instead of Jenn, Peter instead of Pete)

One night there was a pretty major blow-up between her, my husband and me regarding how she was engaging the child in adult conflict. She cursed me out and to de-escalate (and really avoid getting ugly with her) - I just said, “Jennifer/Peter, I’m not doing this with you.” I will admit my tone was similar to that of a parent scolding a child. 

About a month later, I testified in court and any reference to her was by her full first name. 

Now that the custody battle is over, there are court ordered times when the parents are to communicate with the child. Last week, during Mom’s call time the child was with me and therefore the phone call was facilitated through my phone. The child was on FT and the call was coming through the Bluetooth in the car.

I didn't have to wait long to find out what the true reason was for her calling. A few months ago, I ran into her ex-husband at a Target self-checkout. The two of them got divorced about a year and a half ago and are amicable but they both seem to hold on to some unresolved feelings. 

He and I have always gotten along. He's also well liked by family generally although my(our) younger sister has expressed to me that she has harbored some resentment for some of his behavior around the time leading up to the divorce.

So... Yeah. We ran into each, spoke for a few minutes, hugged and went about our ways. I haven't seen, heard from or reached out to him since. However, my sister feels offended that I didn't tell her that I happened to run into him. To be clear, it's not for any safety concerns or things of that nature. 

The phrase that she used was: ""it got back to her"". I guess he mentioned it to a mutual friend of their's at some point and it recently got mentioned to her. She feels offended and thinks it should have been obvious for me to know that I should mention something like that to her and that she's disappointed that she had to ""hear it from someone else.""

Meanwhile I'm doing my best to be empathetic but I'm like... WTF? I didn't think such a random occurrence warranted me notifying her.

First of all, despite being in his 50s, he uses slang all the time. He says stuff like ""low key"" or ""it's giving"", etc., stuff that teens like to say. It's honestly quite embarrassing when he says it, because he isn't the cool type of person, and he often uses them in the wrong context. I've asked him to stop using teen slang before, especially in public, but he still thinks that he's cool and stylish when he does it. Sometimes, he would say something in slang, and then people laugh at him because he's not a teen or young adult, and what he says doesn't make much sense.

84,1en3bk3,AITA for behaving inappropriately after my friends helped me during a difficult time?,"Throwaway for privacy reasons.

Three years ago, I (30s, F) lost my husband (40s, M) unexpectedly to a heart attack. His death turned my world upside down, leaving me devastated emotionally and financially. I was in my second year of an overseas Master’s program, having returned to school to change career, when he passed. Most of my savings had gone to my tuition and I still had six months left.


For immediate expenses, I reached out to a few close friends from school. Working in the same city, 9 of us had reconnected before 5 years and became quite close again, meeting in person at least once a month and chatting daily. I was NC with my parents during this time. My friends were supportive and contributed $2,000 collectively.


The dynamics of the group started changing weirdly after. One friend started acting like she would be the point of contact for the remaining group to me and began imposing what I should do next. Another person, a nurse, constantly called worried I might become addicted to painkillers, even though I have no history with any drugs. Rest avoided direct conversations with me, perhaps out of discomfort with my grief. I went silent, only managing to mutter “I’m getting better” whenever they called. In reality, I struggled with panic attacks, insomnia & depression. Eventually, they stopped calling.


Nearly a year later, after uncovering another betrayal by my late husband, I've turned completely bitter. I still remained in the GCs, where conversations have slowed down, but my friends were wishing each other during holidays & special occasions.


One day, there was an announcement in the GC about the death of the spouse of a mutual acquaintance, which seemed to reference my husband’s passing. I broke silence after almost an year sending a darkly sarcastic remark about those of us who have recently lost spouses and our relative position in a group photo. The GC went silent, and a few messages were sent & deleted before I could read them. The next day, the entire group chat was deleted, and many exited a second group chat I was part of. When I reached out individually, I found I had been blocked by some. Others didn’t respond or claimed they didn’t know what happened. I sent a generic message of apology and gratitude for their support and moved on.


Later, when I was in a better financial position, I texted on the second GC on repaying their aid. One person responded privately and asked me to refrain from calling it a loan, emphasizing it was intended as help. I thanked them and left it at that, not attempting to reconnect further. 


Despite moving on, I sometimes wonder if my behavior was inappropriate. So, AITA for how I acted toward my friends after they helped me during a challenging time?

They weren't married to each other or anything. And they were broken up before I was born. So we were never a family unit and I never really could see them being together. It's actually so weird to think about. But for the most part I had a really close relationship with both of my parents until I was about 10. My mom's ex from back then had broken up with her and blamed me and mom was upset I hadn't treated him like a new dad. She had this big talk with me about it being okay to have ""two daddies"". This was after he'd said I emasculated him by rejecting him as a dad and having my dad around also emasculated him. But he didn't live with us and never babysat me. Plus dad had equal custody of me so I didn't need a new one.

She started dating her boyfriend three years ago. He was new in town and had moved with his kids who are way younger than me. They were dating for about a year when she introduced me to him and then two weeks later I met his kids. Once we'd all met and had like 2-3 times in each other's presence, they started calling us a family. We'd go for dinner once every two weeks all together. She tried to get my dad to give up three hours of his custody time every week so I could have a weekly dinner with them. Dad knew I didn't want to. He also didn't want to give up time with me. So he refused. My mom and her boyfriend were real pissy with my dad afterward. He and his kids started showing up to support me during dance showcases and stuff. I think that was supposed to annoy my dad or something. It didn't. But it did annoy me because of mom's boyfriends attitude.

My mom and her boyfriend started insisting we do all these ""family outings"" together. It was crazy and intense. They didn't use me as a babysitter but they did expect me to choose being with ""family"" over friends. I was supposed to not make plans with friends and keep all free time to spend with all of them. I hated it. Mom and I fought about it and she even brought her boyfriend into the talk when I asked to speak to her alone. So I asked my dad if he could take us to court and let me ask the judge for me to choose where I live and he did 5 months ago. I only went to my moms house once in five months and it was because her boyfriend was out of town. My mom and her boyfriend keep asking me to come to these ""family dinners"". I keep saying no. Mom has cried down the phone to me and cried harder when I'd say they're not my family dinners. She told me the other kids love them and I said because they're little. Her boyfriend, using my mom's phone, sent 30 texts back to back that were a novel of how they thought I'd enjoy spending time with my siblings and would love being looked up to so much by younger kids and would come for that.

86,1en2rsk,AITA for not giving my sister anything to do during my wedding?,"This is frustrating for me because I'm second guessing myself so much now. I (25f) am engaged to my wonderful fiancé Noah (27m). Our wedding is a little smaller. My brother Jay (28m) is my man of honor and Noah's sister (23f) and brother (26m) are his best people. I did not ask my sister Freya (22f) to be a bridesmaid also and I have not figured out any role for her which has resulted in some anger from our parents, but also some accusations of me not treating her like a sister because she's adopted and not my bio sister like Jay is my bio brother.

My parents started fostering Freya when she was 3.5 and adopted her officially when she was 6. Our parents coddled her massively to make sure she didn't feel different or like an outsider because Jay and I were their bio kids and she was adopted. They spoiled her rotten and favored her over us. There were many times our parents scolded me and Jay for wanting equal treatment. They said Freya needed to be secure about her place in the family. The spoiling and coddling came out in her personality. She expects people to go out of their way to make her happy, she has this desperation to be included in everything but is very clingy and also childish in the way she expects her choices should be the priority in decision making. She's especially demanding of Jay, because he's meant to be the doting older brother and the one who chases boys away, who offers to protect her and she makes sure nobody messes with her. When she was 17 she had this breakup. I guess the boy cheated on her and she was hysterical at Jay because he didn't come and make the boys life hell and he didn't make sure the guy stayed away from her after the breakup. She still brings it up today. She said that he did more when my high school ex started spreading nasty rumors about me than when her ex cheated. She'll bring it up around others in an effort to shame him. When it comes to stuff with me she has always talked about the fact I didn't give her my jewelry box that our grandma bought for me when I was like 12. Freya never liked that I got something like that but she never did. She still expects me to give it to her just because she wants it and to hell with whether I want it or not.

I'm only inviting Freya or my parents because they are family. But I don't want her in my wedding. I don't want another chance for her to be the center of attention. And I don't want to be left catering to her demands. But not including her has really not sit well with her or my parents. They keep calling and asking why and how could I exclude her from such a big moment in my life and then around to the fact I care less for her because she's adopted.

I'm only inviting Freya or my parents because they are family. But I don't want her in my wedding. I don't want another chance for her to be the center of attention. And I don't want to be left catering to her demands. But not including her has really not sit well with her or my parents. They keep calling and asking why and how could I exclude her from such a big moment in my life and then around to the fact I care less for her because she's adopted.

87,1en2rin,AITA Ex bf wants me to sign papers to refinance mortage so he can take 17000 out.,"

So i 38f recently left my ex Josh after 12 years of financial and mental abuse.
We own a house together and while i've moved into my mothers house with our 3 kids, he has stayed in our house.
Im trying to get off the mortage and give it all to him so i can later on buy again, and just be free from him.
The problem is, he contacted me and said i need to sign papers so he can get the equity out of the house to buy him a car. ""I took his car"" even though its mine but he wouldnt transfer it over to me.

He has a gambling problem and its getting worse, all the money he has gambled in the weeks ive been gone, he could have brought a second hand car buy now.
I dont want him to gamble the mortage and eventually make our names blacklisted.
So i said i will not sign. And let me get off the mortage first then he can do whatever he likes.
This has caused him to become angry and call me all sorts of names that i had to block him.
He then messaged me through fb and told me its my fault he just gambled 1500 back pay to win a car and im dead to him.
I have blocked him also on fb now.
Am i the asshole?

I could be the asshole as i did take my car that was under his name ""control"" reasons and i wont let him take equity out.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-08,"AITA Ex bf wants me to sign papers to refinance mortage so he can take 17000 out.

88,1en2i8s,AITA for telling my friends about my medication and ruining my parents reputations,"I m16 started taking wellbutrin for depression a few weeks ago which has made me lose my appetite a lot and caused me to lose quite a bit of weight. My family is korean so this kind of thing is a huge deal to them and they really don’t want anybody to find out. I haven’t told any of my friends about it.

I was scrawny since I was a kid but after I started taking it I became much skinnier and I guess the change is noticeable enough for my friends to catch on. They asked me if I was ok and that I looked like I haven’t been eating much. I didn’t want to tell them so I just said I didn’t have an appetite recently which is kind of true.

They pestered me about it for the next few weeks and I just never knew what to say. I told my mom about it and she told me that I wasn't allowed to tell anybody and if anybody outside of my family found out it would be horrible for my parents. Because their social circle is quite traditional. So I tried to reassure my friends that everything was fine and not to worry because I do have a reason I just can’t tell anyone.

After a while, I heard from one of my friends that my whole friend group thought I had an eating disorder and that I needed serious help.  Like they were gonna confront me about it and report me to the counsellor. At that point I felt that this was really a drastic move.

I didn’t know how to stop them so I just decided that I would tell them and I did. And they all kind of just accepted and moved on. But, one of my friends goes to the same church as me, and told her mom, who asked my mom about it and now apparently her whole church group knows and she’s really upset about it. I notice they give her looks sometimes now and stare at us when we meet them.

89,1en2fyo,AITA for making my sister catch the bus home alone at night?,"My (F24) younger sister (F17) recently got a job, which has been great for her. She gets to learn some responsibility, build a resume and make a bit of cash, things I wish I'd done at 17.

We live with my parents and other siblings in a decent home, and my parents aren't *rich* rich, but they've never struggled financially.

I work a full time job and am saving to move out soon, because let's be honest, living with people sucks ass. I'm very lucky to be in the position I am in where I can save, and even though I don't have to pay rent (I have offered), I do try to help out where I can.

Now to the story: my sister has a shift that finishes at 8:30pm on a Thursday. Not that late but after dark. Normally my dad would go pick her up from these kinds of shifts, but on this night, he and my mum were at a concert and were unable to. My other sister (F20) with a driver's license is working late and can't pick her up either. 

My sister who needs a lift is still a learner and can't drive without a supervisor for another month or so, not that we have a car she could use anyway.

That leaves me. I work during the day so am technically free in the evenings, but I really avoid doing anything after work on a weeknight. I have an extremely limited social battery, and mild but chronic pain that is at its worst at night. I am always exhausted after working all day, and need to be well rested for the next early morning, but knowing I rarely get a good night's sleep, I have to go to bed pretty early. Usually around 8-8:30pm.

Because of this, and the fact its been a bit of a bad week pain-wise, I said that I would not be picking my sister up from work. If it were a Friday or Saturday night, I'd have said yes as I can sleep in the next morning, but I really don't want to be sacrificing my well-being when I need to be at work the next morning.

This means my sister will have to catch the bus home by herself. Now, this is something I'd done dozens of times at her age, and we live in a very safe area in a safe country, so it's about as safe as being out, alone after dark can be. There'll always be some risk to being outside alone after dark though, and I think my sister is a little scared. It would be her first time.

My parents aren't mad at me, but my sister is annoyed that she has to catch the bus by herself after dark.

90,1en230u,AITA (guidelines) Parents bought me a car that I now have to pay half of,"Listen I feel so corny for posting in this but I have a genuine concern. 
I feel like an entitled spoiled brat talking about this because I am so lucky that I have parents that would be willing to do that. 
Backstory: my family has a history of spending money they don’t have
I’m 19 and my parents always had a deal with me that they will pay for half of my first car e.g. car is 12,000 they will pay 6k and I will pay 6k. I work a minimum wage job and earn fk all and like to party so I only had about 4.5k saved up since I was about 15. I had always said to my parents ‘let’s please buy a cheap car I can’t spend anymore than 5K on it, I don’t earn enough to save much and I need to buy myself things to make me happy as I have mental health issues.’ My dad is impulsive and one day takes me for a test drive in a small Kia and asks me if I like it. I know nothing about cars whatsoever and I didn’t want to be rude so I said ‘yeah it’s cool.’ 20 minutes later he comes to my room saying he has bought the car. I cry and hug him because I’m so grateful that he would do that but then the next day I ask him how much it was. It was 19.8k!!!!!! So I only have 4.5K saved up and now i owe him another 5k. I cannot save that money up since I’m about to start studying with my low paying casual job. Keep in mind, this car is cheap to run and is still under warranty which is awesome, but if I get T boned with this very small city car I’m dead instantly, and so are friends, family, my partner if they are in the car with me. I feel like I had no say in this decision and now I owe my parents 5k which I probably won’t have unless I win the lottery or something.

92,1en1sp0,WIBTA for throwing out some old underwear?,"ETA2: I have decided not to do this and we will have a chat when he comes home tonight. I really appreciate the people who have explained this to me and been kind/patient. It really does much more for helping me than the people who immediately jump to calling me horrible things for asking a simple ‘would this be bad’ question.

My husband is very into his personal hygiene and buys a lot of underwear, as he likes to change it throughout the day if he ‘feels sweaty down there’. We share laundry duty and I have never noticed any issues with his personal cleanliness, and his underwear is never stained or otherwise gross.

The thing is, quite a few pairs of his boxers are showing their age now with big holes in the legs, various loose threads/elastics, and so on. I’ve asked multiple times why he keeps them and his reasoning is ‘they still cover the important bits’. I appreciate that reasoning, but honestly he has such a large amount of underwear already that these would hardly be missed. We both came from less affluent backgrounds growing up so I definitely do understand the desire to hold onto things until they’re completely unusable, but we are financially comfortable these days and he has plenty of much nicer underwear.

I’m thinking of throwing the tired stuff out, and buying him new underwear to compensate if more is needed. I really don’t think he’s got a specific emotional attachment to his tattered boxer shorts of all thing, but I also don’t know if I’m being presumptive by saying that (I’m autistic so I’m not sure if what I’m contemplating is a massive faux pas). So, would I be TA for throwing these out?


ETA: We do throw out each other’s fully broken things and it’s never caused a problem. Also, when I say tattered, I mean REALLY worn out. It’s not just a couple little moth holes, I think it’s actively impeding their ability to be worn easily.

93,1en0vml,WIBTA for asking my boyfriend to not meet one on one with his girl friend? ,"WIBTA for asking my boyyfriend to not meet one on one with his girl friend?  

So my boyfriend has his girl friend from school. Recently she broke up with her boyfriend and wants to meet with my bf more often. They met before the break up once, alone. My bf says it was in the bar, but I'm not sure if it was the only place they have been in. I had issue with him for meeting with her after her break up, because he told me that that day he couldn't meet up with me (even tho we had a really important topic to discuss) but as soon as she called he was ready to go. I tried to talk about it with him, he said that he sees her rarely and also I probably wouldn't want to meet up after 7 pm. I told him that he assumed that I wouldn't want to meet up and the talk about it practically eneded at that, he changed the subject. They met like two time over this summer, she wants to meet more now. 

So here's the thing, would I be the asshole if I asked him to not meet with her one on one, but in the group? I feel kinda anxious when they meet alone, she seems like the kind of gril that dosen't have any female friends because ""girls are such a dramatic people"", at least that's what I have observed, I don't know her too well. I felt ok when I knew that them meeting up wasn't on a regular basis, but if they do want to meet more often, I would feel better if they met in the group of people, not alone.

95,1en0ntq,AITA for refusing to take care of my MIL’s dog?,"So my (23M) GF’s (23F) mother has recently gotten a small puppy out of nowhere, she’s very impulsive and she just bought him on a whim.

She is now extremely stressed out by the dog and constantly freaks out about how to train him and all the responsibility that comes with owning a dog. My GF, who stays with me at my place almost all week despite not living here has asked if I want to take care of the dog because her mother can’t deal with it right now and wants to see her BF, for some reason she can’t take care of it at the same time. 

Now I am a massive introvert. I love my alone time more than anything in the world and I physically cannot go very long being in close proximity with even the people I love. I just feel comfortable alone, I don’t have a choice unfortunately. My GF stays with me the whole week which I do enjoy but end up feeling burnt out towards the end so I tell her I need some time alone, which ends up being 2 days maximum.

It’s been 15 or so hours since she’s left me and now her and her mother are asking if my GF and my dog can come over and stay the night. (Mind you we’ve had him over 2 nights in a row just recently, and though I love him he’s a lot to deal with, being a puppy and all).

She calls me and I politely decline, however she takes this personally.

TL;DR:

My GF’s mother wants me to take care of a puppy on my night off because she can’t deal with it, AITA?

UPDATE:

She’s breaking up with me because I didn’t say yes. Again I’m not sure if Im in the wrong or not because she’s saying that I don’t understand the full spectrum of the situation, and I really don’t. She’s saying she REALLY needed help with this, and that she can’t be with someone who isn’t thoughtful and caring.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-08,"AITA for refusing to take care of my MIL’s dog? So my (23M) GF’s (23F) mother has recently gotten a small puppy out of nowhere, she’s very impulsive and she just bought him on a whim.

She is now extremely stressed out by the dog and constantly freaks out about how to train him and all the responsibility that comes with owning a dog. My GF, who stays with me at my place almost all week despite not living here has asked if I want to take care of the dog because her mother can’t deal with it right now and wants to see her BF, for some reason she can’t take care of it at the same time. 

Now I am a massive introvert. I love my alone time more than anything in the world and I physically cannot go very long being in close proximity with even the people I love. I just feel comfortable alone, I don’t have a choice unfortunately. My GF stays with me the whole week which I do enjoy but end up feeling burnt out towards the end so I tell her I need some time alone, which ends up being 2 days maximum.

It’s been 15 or so hours since she’s left me and now her and her mother are asking if my GF and my dog can come over and stay the night. (Mind you we’ve had him over 2 nights in a row just recently, and though I love him he’s a lot to deal with, being a puppy and all).

She calls me and I politely decline, however she takes this personally. Saying “Is that how much you don’t want to see me?” Making me feel like I don’t have an opinion on the matter, I try to compromise and say “we can hang out tomorrow if you’d like” etc etc. she starts crying, hanging up and whatnot.

96,1en0k3c,AITA for having bad short term memory,"Let me point out first that this is specifically about me and my dad. Of course if I’m talking to someone that doesn’t know of my memory problems, I’d have absolutely no reason to blame them at all for me forgetting something.

I’m a man in his 30s, and I’ve had some short term memory problems since I was a kid. My dad knows this of course, and he’s aware of the way that I tend to ask questions to best avoid forgetting things.

For example, we’ll be having a conversation and my dad will say something which gives me a couple of follow-up questions. So I’ll continue listening until he’s done speaking, and ask my questions. However unless I’m constantly repeating the questions in my head until he’s done, I will have forgotten what I even wanted to ask in the first place. Repeating them in my head though just causes me to miss out on the last half of whatever he was saying, which makes me feel even more like one of those assholes who is always just waiting for their turn to speak and who doesn’t care what other people are saying.

So my goal is: Once my dad is done speaking, I’ll say something like “OK I have 2 questions: first one is “\_\_”, and second one is “\_\_\_.”

However rather than letting me get both questions out in full, he’ll instead cut me off mid-question thinking he already knows what I’m going to ask. 9 times out of 10 I will now have forgotten what my 2nd question was. Granted this is not that big of a deal, believe me when I say that it gets very old, very fast. Especially since he knows that allowing me to finish asking my questions rather than cutting me off seems to magically let my brain remember what I was asking. Yet if I point out that he cut me off and now I don’t remember what my 2nd question was, he says that I’m the asshole.

Believe me, I know all too well how frustrating it is to put up with me. I’m not doing it on purpose, and I would love nothing more in life than a normal short term memory.

97,1en0gfy,AITA for going off on my sibling for having their ex at our apt,"i am trying to keep this as anonymous and vague as possible so I won’t provide specific details like age but my sibling and I are both under 30. 

They started staying with me because they were having relationship troubles. They went back to their ex once after I did a lot to help them get on their feet and gain independence after being in a bad relationship for multiple years, and lied to me about it/snuck around. I told them when they went back that they could find somewhere to stay for a week and come back if they were done with their ex, or they could go back with their ex and I’d be here when they were really ready to be done. 

They contacted me again months later saying they were really done. We were talking about them moving in and being on my lease about a month from then, and their ex went through their phone and saw the messages, told them they could stay until my place was ready, and then kicked them out the next day and I had to come get them to stay on my couch until they could move in. 

It’s now been a little under a year, my lease at my old place ended and we got an apartment together. They slipped up and contacted their ex and snuck around with them while on the lease and wound up in a dangerous situation and I was extremely upset and they didn’t understand why. I told them it was due to safety concerns, and they seemed to understand. I expressed that their ex was NOT allowed at that house, and she understood. 

I have a side job where I’m away for a couple days at a time, they know and usually asks the days I’ll be gone so they can find a ride to work since I’m typically their ride. I didn’t think much of it this time around since it’s typical for them to ask me when I’ll be gone. I came back to grab some things I’d forgotten and found their exes car parked in my spot at our current apartment. I had forgotten my key and had texted that I’d be coming by and I’d need to be let in. When I saw the car I flipped, I banged on the door and when they opened it I said “you’re fucking stupid” grabbed what I came for, and left. 

We got into a text argument and they argued that since they pay rent they should be allowed to have whoever they want over and that it wasn’t fair for me to tell them their ex couldn’t be at the apartment. They said they didn’t remember me specifically saying their ex couldn’t be at the new place. 

I feel like their ex not being allowed at the apartment should’ve been a given since they weren’t allowed at our old place. I feel unsafe with their ex knowing where we live and now I’m paranoid that their ex is at the apartment while I’m here. I’m scared.

98,1en0c7k,AITA for not giving my step sister my great grandparents house,"Very long story short my great grandparents died about 20 years ago. The house had to be torn down to the studs and rebuilt for biohard reasons.

For a while I (24f) was living with my mother (49f) in my late grandmother's house with her boyfriend (50m) (now husband) and his son (23m). But as tension rose between me and her husband (let's call him bob) and his son (let's call him connor) I decided to move out and get my own apartment. I was tired of being disrespected and made out to be the villian, because his son was ""the perfect angel."" I would still come to visit my mother often, but I would leave once either of them got home. 

Work finally started on the ""project house"" Basically anything that could be done without a specialist, we did. Me, Bob, Connor, and my mom worked on this house for 5 years. 

There was a lot of debate regarding who would get the house, either me or Connor. They decided I would get it because I was living by myself and connor was refusing to pay rent (which was in a contract he signed with my mom and bob) and a few other reasons, like it's my great grandparents parents house.

I have been living in my mini dream house (think tiny 2 bedroom cottage, about 900sqft) for about 4 months now. My step sister (26f) (let's call her ava) suddenly comes back into the picture because she will date a guy for a few months then cheat on him and lives with the guy she cheated on him with. (7 or 8 times now) Her child is about 5 and has been bounced around with her. (Baby daddy is stable and wants the kid but she won't let him)

Recently she started calling her father (Bob) and asking to move in with him, he said no, there's no room for her and a child, let alone her horses. (She cares more about her horses than her child)

Fast forward a week and she calls again asking if ""Sunday is OK for him to come pick up the trailer"" He asks her where she thinks a huge horse trailer would go, and she said ""behind op's house"" he says ""why don't you ask op if you can put it behind her house."" She goes quiet and says ""can you ask her, she'll say no to me"" like damn, you just answered your own question. So bob ends up laughing and saying ""well I think she hates me more than you, so good luck on that""

Another week goes by and she throws another fit this time demanding the house. Because ""why should op get to live in a nice, 2 bedroom house when she doesn't have any kids or even a boyfriend."" Now her mom (bobs ex) is taking avas side and yelling at bob to give ava the house. 

Bob ends up getting into a fight with my mom about it because ""it really doesn't seem fair."" 

Mind you I am the only child who has had to work for everything, the house is the only thing I ever got ""handed"" to me, and I helped pay for most of it because it was what I wanted. They get whatever they want when they want. Except the house.

So aita for putting my foot down and telling my step sister she can not kick me out of ""my house""

Edit: the deed is in my mother and bobs name, there is no rental agreement, but a written ""rent to own"" document. It's not signed off by a lawyer or on legal paper, just a spreadsheet saying if op pays x amount per month then in x months the equity loan will be payed off. At that point I can buy it from them.

99,1en08u9,AITA for getting mad about my birthday cake," I(f) recently turned 20, and as I've done for the past 5 years, I made my own birthday cake.

Baking/cooking for people has always been my love language. It fills me with joy to see people enjoy the things I make them so I cook/bake very often for events.
My birthday cake is always my favorite project, I'm a sucker for themes and I have concepts for cakes up to my 28th birthday. It's a very fun creative project.

This year I made one of those ornate cakes you see on pinterest and wrote ""I beat teen pregnancy"" on it. 
It took over a month of planning and designing  because I have a pretty packed schedule with work and school but I was very excited.

the day before my birthday party I spent prepping and planning, then on the day I woke up at 7 and immediately kept on with preparations and I finished it less than an hour before the guests started arriving. 

I had only invited a few of my friends, in the end there were 7 guests and me. one of the guests was this girl Cindy (f23, fake name). She's from one of my classes, we just met a few months ago but we're always chit chatting in class and I invited her in hopes of becoming even closer. 

The whole party goes swimmingly; drinks, games, karaoke, snacks, all fun. All throughout I'm super excited about the cake, I can't stop talking about it, I'm sure my friends are only putting up with me because it's my birthday.
One of the guys kinda jokingly asks why I'm so excited about it when we're all just sitting around and my bestie jumps in to explain that I'm always like that and how food is my way to show I care. 

A few minutes before midnight I bring out the cake. After we sing and I'm about to blow out the candles Cindy grabs a handful of the cake and smears it on my face.

Everyone kinda stared at her and I just looked down and started silently sobbing for some reason. I was so sad and angry and she was laughing. My bestie started screaming at her and I was kinda out of it.

I only heard her say something like ""what's the fuss about some cake"" and I snapped.
I told her that I worked really hard on that, and It wasn't just some cake it was the hours of effort and dedication behind them that she just smeared and I was excited to share it with my friends. We called eachother names and I kept crying. My boyfriend told her to get out and she said he couldn't do that it wasn't his house, so I kicked her out.

I haven't talked to her since and my friends all say she was in the wrong but I can't help but think she might just nit have known that it was a big deal for me, maybe yo her that prank was a sign of affection and to her I snapped at nothing. I tried to apologize but she texted this long paragraph about me being childish and immature, and how I got my friend's to gang up on her...

100,1en08dn,AITA? Keep getting mid-expensive gifts from in-laws but i hate the gifts.,"My mother in law loves gifting things to people. At the same time, she isn’t a very great listener. (Which im okay with for the most part)

However, every time she gifts me something, she gifts me something expensive that i do not like. I cannot hide my reaction as I wear my emotions on my face. Last year she gifted me this really expensive necklace that had a a huge pendant. The “pendant” was the size of my actual hand and yes… it was a humongous stick figure of a girl. I was in shock as I had never seen anything more hideous and huge in my life. That also is not something she would wear and my husband was also left speechless. I felt awful okay? I couldn’t even fake my way through it so I had to laugh. 

This year, I was telling her a story about how I absolutely hate coach purses, especially the ones with the C’s all over it, there was some trauma behind the reason why I do not like that specific design which is what I was explaining to her. Well, that’s exactly what she gifted me. She keeps getting me Swarvoski earrings as well and I am confused as to who told her that I like Swarvoski. I don’t ever wear them so what is pushing her to see me and think of Swarvoski?

The coach purse and earrings had a tag on it but no gift receipt so I was confused as to what she expected me to do with it. Is it wrong for me to ask for a receipt to return it or should I keep my mouth shut, sell the items for a lower price and get something I like for myself? I feel like a total Beyotch, there are people dying and starving in this world so either way I don’t feel like I deserve any gifts.

For more context: My mother in law is the same as me. She told my husband that she hates getting gifts because people can never figure out what she truly likes or wants so she ends up selling or giving things away. She kind of gets mad so that’s why I didn’t feel so bad bc I feel maybe we share the same sentiment lol and now i’m getting self conscious about getting her a gift next.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-08,"AITA?

I really need to ask opinions or advice. I (28F) am married to (32M) we have been together 8yrs, married 6yrs. We have no kids together. I have become very unhappy in the last 10 months. I have talked to him about how I feel, but nothing is really changing. We have both agreed we have hit our roommate stage, we have said this at least 3 times with in the last 4 months. But I started noticing things that use to not bother me or I just turned a blind eye to. The last 4 yrs we haven't really been out we don't do much together we may go out for dinner once every 3 months. All he wants to do is sit at home and watch tv for 12 to 16 hours a day. He claims he doesn't like people and has to force himself to go out and do anything. I want to go out with our friends and go out together and just do stuff. When we finally go out to do anything we always fight before we do anything. We are almost not intimate, (TMI) we may be once a month or once every 2 to 3 months. He never wants to come out of our room (we live with my parents) and when my brother comes over he will not come out and won't even spend a little time with my family. He will stay in the bedroom ALL day, but his bestfriend came down for a weekend and he stayed out of the bedroom all weekend long only time he came to the room was when he was tired. I have financially supported most of our relationship, he has had 11 jobs since we have been together. He has a job now where he has it easy (for medical reasons) but all he does is complain about it. Here with in the last couple of months his friend from highschool (never has talked about her before) reached out about a job offer and is now talking about quitting to work for her. I've also started noticing how DARK his sense of humor is and it's been bothering me as well. I have a autistic sibling that he constantly picks on them and is kind of a bully to them, my sibling will end up living with me after my parents pass away so I worry alot for them once they're gone. There is so much more he does but this post is already getting too long. So am I in the wrong for wanting to get a divorce?

103,1emzqq4,AITA for not including a friend on a girl's trip when she has gone previously?,"4 years ago I moved to a state that is close to the beach. Every year, my 3 BFFs have driven or flown in from my home state about 17 hours away for a girl's trip to the beach. It's great to get away from our crazy schedules and reconnect, just us girls. Because we live so far away, we don't get to chat like we used to, so I really love getting the time to spend with them to catch up on all the gossip and laughs. 

Last year, one of the friends was a complete bitch the entire time, tried to pick fights, talked shit about one of us to the others when one wasn't in the room, and basically made the entire time miserable. She was on her phone nonstop, stalking people on social media and talking shit about them. We didn't care and didn't want to hear it. We even called her out on her crap, but that just made things worse. We were able to make light of things by having ""water time,"" which was the 3 of us would get in the water so we wouldn't have to listen to her, as she refused to get in the water. It was our time of peace and time to be like, what the actual fuck? We're not high schoolers. GenX here. So really, what the actual fuck? 

Every place we went to eat or have drinks, she was focused on asking the wait staff who they thought was the youngest and got even more bitchy when they didn't say her (she’s actually the oldest & looks it).

Since that trip, we’ve all drifted away from our friendships with her. In the last year, any contact I've had with her has been my doing. Both my inlaws passed away within 3 months of each other, and she made no attempt to reach out to see me while I was back and didn't even come to the funerals. I can understand if people can't make it, but for supposedly being my bestie, right?

When I went back a third time several months later, I met with the other 2 friends but decided not to invite her and not to say anything that we got together. Somehow she found out because she posted passive aggressive crap on Facebook that HAD to be directed towards us. That's what she does. It's so dam ridiculous!

Recently we planned this year’s girl's trip and didn’t include her in the plans. We all agreed that our relationships with her have been estranged and felt we didn't want a repeat of the last trip. We are keeping it hushed because none of us wants to hurt her feelings and we know she will act like a 12 year old, throw a fit, calling/texting people we know to let them know what shitty friends we are for not including her. I do feel bad because she is a friend and a part of me feels she's going through some type of age/mid life crisis and that I should be there for her. The other part of me wants to just be up front with her and tell her how ridiculous her actions are and that she needs to grow the fuck up.

105,1emzezl,AITA for telling my sister to stop expecting me to play baby daddy? ,"My (29F) twin sister, Maya, has a 1-year-old son, Lucas. A little backstory: she had a horrible pregnancy right from the first trimester and had to quit her job since she was spending too much time out of the office. Her ex-boyfriend turned out to be a POS who claimed Maya had cheated on him and pinned the baby on him, and when my family insisted on taking a paternity test as soon as the baby was born, he agreed but went out for some milk before the due date.

After Lucas was born, finances became too tricky with a newborn and Maya’s postpartum complications. She asked if I could let her stay with me temporarily so she doesn’t have to pay rent and I agreed. I have an extra room in my house (which I inherited from my grandma) so I don’t have to worry about rent either.

Long story short, it’s been tough living with a baby whose mother needs so much more help than one person can provide. Our parents live too far to be of any help. Anyway, I didn’t mind waking up half the time to give Lucas his bottle or staying with him when she needed some time to herself. I also paid for everything baby-related. Hospital bills for both her and my nephew, food, clothes, and diapers, you name it. But now that both Maya and my nephew are stable enough that she resumed working, she started pushing for more. She expected me to keep paying for everything, but I told her it’s harder now that I’m not putting in as many hours and I get paid per hour. Still, she buys nothing and I end up paying anyway. She also thinks it doesn’t make sense to pay for daycare when I’m home most of the day. I ended up paying for it myself when she wouldn't.

(I think it’s important to add I refused to adopt Lucas. Everyone has always known I will adopt a child or more in the future but when Maya asked, I didn’t think she would be willing to stay in her bio son’s life as an aunt, and I don't think the confusion would do anyone any good.)

So Monday, she asked me to take Lucas to his hospital appointment and I said no. I told her to take a day off for that, because my job hasn’t been doing well lately as I’ve been spending too much time taking care of Lucas. She pointed out how this is my nephew and if I adopt kids, I will need to make sacrifices too, to which I said ""I will make them when the time comes but I’m not Lucas’s dad and although I'm happy to help where I can, I shouldn’t be expected to change my life for him.""

Maya took a day off but since the appointment, she hasn’t spoken to me except a yes/no mumble when I talk to her, and she’s been keeping Lucas in her room when he’s not at daycare. I love the little guy with all my life, and I’m wondering if maybe I took things too far. AITA?

108,1emz7zo,AITA for not going to a vacation my BF (23M) paid for?,"Hello all,

Me (21F) and my BF (23M) have been dating for almost 3 years and this weekend was supposed to be our anniversary vacation. My BF planned this vacation about a month ago as my anniversary present and paid for all the costs. I was really happy and all but he ruined my excitement to go with his behavior. (Context is below)

My personal pet peeve is when people come later than the time they say and also when they don’t make me the priority. I’ve had this problem with my BF for pretty long time. Whenever my BF meets his friends, he for example tells me that he’ll be home at 10 and then ends up coming at 10:10 or sometimes 10:15 and it annoys me so much. I have tried telling him that this behavior isn’t okay on my behalf and I really value people being on time. Although he insists that 10-15 minutes isn’t considered late and that he’s basically on time. 

Going back to today, the day I decided to not go to the anniversary vacation. Yesterday my BF was supposed to meet his friends at 5pm but they came at 8pm (which is not my issue) and he met them till 10pm as we agreed. Today in the morning he called me and told me that he wanted to meet them for a short time today (for about an hour) even though he told me that he would spend the day with me after work. I told him that he should keep his promise and spend time with me instead since that’s what he said he wanted to do. He said that his friend has a gift for him so he wants to receive the gift and meet him for a while. I suggested that the friend can come in front of our place and give him the gift for 10 seconds and then leave. He said he isn’t okay with it and he insisted on meeting his friend and called me restrictive.

Although I don’t think I’m being restrictive. I never had any issue with him meeting his friends, I just wasn’t okay with it today because he told me he would get off work early to spend time with me and help me with some things. Instead, he’s choosing to prioritize his friends over me. I told him that I don’t want to go to the vacation he planned and he got super mad, saying that it was non-refundable and he tried hard making all the plans.

I understand that my action might not have been the nicest but I just feel like his slave because I’m always there for him when he wants me to be but when I want him around, he just wants to meet his friends. I cook for him every day, 1-2 times a day and even bring his lunch to work for him. It shouldn’t be difficult for him to just spend time with me instead of spending time with his friends.

EDIT1: I forgot to mention that he wanted to propose on the vacation, I found out because I found a ring under his clothes and when I confronted him about it and asked did you want to propose on the vacation he told me that he didn’t want to and wasn’t planning on doing it. Even though he could have simply told me the truth…

EDIT2: There is more to all of this, we were in the process of moving out and already paid the first rent and the deposit for another flat, so now I am in a very terrible situation since I cannot break up with him (because I can’t afford to live on my own and neither can he) and we’re stuck in the flat for a year together or until one of us can afford to move out. So it is all so overwhelming on me and I frankly don’t know.

EDIT3: For all the people who have commented and villanized me in the comments, I get where you are coming from, although it is important to mention that our relationship wasn’t all flowers and sunshine for the last few months. On Monday this week, he took a belt on me and before for the whole time throughout the relationship, there were episodes of him being pretty abusive both mentally and physically. I stayed with him through that no matter what. He claims to have “changed”. So him respecting my requests is the bare minimum in my opinion.

TLDR; AITA for not going to a planned anniversary vacation with my BF which he paid for because he’s constantly late and doesn’t prioritize me? ",Asshole,2024-08-08,"AITA for not going to a vacation my BF (23M) paid for? Hello all,

Me (21F) and my BF (23M) have been dating for almost 3 years and this weekend was supposed to be our anniversary vacation. My BF planned this vacation about a month ago as my anniversary present and paid for all the costs. I was really happy and all but he ruined my excitement to go with his behavior. (Context is below)

My personal pet peeve is when people come later than the time they say and also when they don’t make me the priority. I’ve had this problem with my BF for pretty long time. Whenever my BF meets his friends, he for example tells me that he’ll be home at 10 and then ends up coming at 10:10 or sometimes 10:15 and it annoys me so much. I have tried telling him that this behavior isn’t okay on my behalf and I really value people being on time. Although he insists that 10-15 minutes isn’t considered late and that he’s basically on time. 

Going back to today, the day I decided to not go to the anniversary vacation. Yesterday my BF was supposed to meet his friends at 5pm but they came at 8pm (which is not my issue) and he met them till 10pm as we agreed. Today in the morning he called me and told me that he wanted to meet them for a short time today (for about an hour) even though he told me that he would spend the day with me after work. I told him that he should keep his promise and spend time with me instead since that’s what he said he wanted to do. He said that his friend has a gift for him so he wants to receive the gift and meet him for a while. I suggested that the friend can come in front of our place and give him the gift for 10 seconds and then leave. He said he isn’t okay with it and he insisted on meeting his friend and called me restrictive.

Although I don’t think I’m being restrictive. I never had any issue with him meeting his friends, I just wasn’t okay with it today because he told me he would get off work early to spend time with me and help me with some things. Instead, he’s choosing to prioritize his friends over me. I told him that I don’t want to go to the vacation he planned and he got super mad, saying that it was non-refundable and he tried hard making all the plans.

I understand that my action might not have been the nicest but I just feel like his slave because I’m always there for him when he wants me to be but when I want him around, he just wants to meet his friends.

I am 28 years old and living in Jersey. My best friend is getting married in 2026. We have been best friends for approaching 20 years. We have a female friend group of 5, all best friends. I am one of the 4 bridesmaids 

The expectation from the bridesmaids is to buy our own dresses €100 + accessories, pay for the hen doo €350, spending money for hen do €150-200, second hen do, €400, spending money for second hen do €400, stay over at wedding, €300, spending money at wedding €2-300, post wedding party the day after wedding €150, wedding present unsure as do not know what I am going to get yet. 

On the higher end that is about €1800 (without gift). The issue is not that I can’t afford it, however that is pocket change for me. This will probably also prevent me going on a holiday with my long term partner next year due to the financial impact as I wouldn’t even spend that much on a holiday with my partner.

All the weddings I have been to in the past have been small and lowkey so I don’t know if this is normal and if this is a reasonable ask or not?

My daughter’s class is really great and the teachers are excellent. We never had any problems until now. The teacher told me that there is another Indian child that has started recently and she and my daughter are becoming really good friends. So may be we can contact the kid’s parents and arrange play dates. I thought what a great idea! We literally don’t have any other Indian family in the town we are staying. So we were excited too. 

Cut to yesterday morning at the drop off, where I see the other Indian kid and I got to know that she is adopted by an American couple. Great!, I thought. I said hi to the mother and said bye to our girls. 

We started talking and I got to know that she wanted to talk me desperately. She said needed help with giving some cultural knowledge and background to her daughter. I was absolutely on board. So I asked her a natural first question “Which state in India does she come from?” That apparently offended her (?). 

I said I can tell her basic stuff and of course involve her in our cultural activities, but there are 29 states in India, and if she wanted me to teach her culture specific stuff like language, songs, food, she needs to tell which culture her daughter has come from. Of course I don’t mind teaching from my own state. 

She hurriedly left. I saw her today and said hi but she didn’t respond and left in hurry again. I asked the teacher if everything was alright and she said that other mom does not want our girls to be friends anymore because I shamed her for not knowing anything about her daughter’s roots?

112,1emyy31,AITA for reacting like I had with my partner over a game? Long story short,"AITA for being annoyed at my partner over a game? 

I (25F) and my partner (26M) have been in a relationship for almost 3 years. Our dynamic is awesome and he is the best bf ever but recently I’ve been getting annoyed. 

We both work and have busy schedules however my work tends to run a bit longer depending on the day, so by the time I’m home I am exhausted! 

My partner loves playing video games and he wanted me to play some of his old childhood games and I wanting to make him happy; agreed. I agreed to play his games and complete them but there was no timeline, I would play for a bit (1 hour or so a day before bed or smth) pretty chill. But recently my work life has been too much, got a lot of paper work and a lot of things that keeps my brain wired, so when I come back home at the end, I really want to like just chill and fill my own battery, if you know what I mean. But my partner always is like, “oh you’re chilling! You can probably play the game on the switch then!” 
Which is fine but when I say no he tends to pout bringing up my promise to play the game. Anyways, feeling guilty, I decided to play for at least 30 minutes then I reached my maximum and I put the game away. His response to that was “fine! Then tomorrow you’ll play for 2 hours to compensate today” 
That got me really pissed off. 

My partner relaxes and recharges himself through gaming and watching his fav shows etc. But mine is not the same and he knows it, I like to read, chill and do something I want to do, but sometimes I feel like he doesn’t get it. 

Like today I came home early cz I asked to leave early feeling extra tired. I told him straight out that I need some time alone to recharge, he is happy to oblige and told me to relax and then proceeded to say “enjoy your chill time but tonight we are playing the game.” I said no. Like straight no I don’t want to.

But I think he ignored my “no”.

I am just annoyed and tired and I don’t want to be a bad partner by not playing with him but omg I am in conflict with myself. 

[Edit] thanks guys for the answers, I try my best to have quality time and do stuff that he likes but yeah some things feel like too much, for instance one of his fav shows, he wants to watch it with me, which I’m fine with but  I am not allowed to use my phone or do any activity while watching. I can’t sit still, I get anxious and fidgety so at least crocheting to my keep my hands busy help me but nope, not allowed,  the moment my eyes are off the tv for a second it’s a pause of the video. I never do such things in return, like I don’t make him watch my shows, do my hobbies because I understand that my hobbies are not his cup of tea and tbh I am no gamer girl and he knows I can’t play much but omg the promise keeps coming up. I feel like if I’m dead on the floor he will probably tell me to die later because I have a game to play, that’s how I feel sometimes. 

Sorry maybe I’m being over emotional and over exaggerating but I am close to just crying. ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-08,"AITA for reacting like I had with my partner over a game? Long story short AITA for being annoyed at my partner over a game?

114,1emym1o,AITA for going home early on a family vacation after my mother in law constantly invaded my privacy?,"I, 38M, am the solo breadwinner of this house. I have a wife 35F and a daughter 5F. Me and my wife has been planning this family vacation to Venice for months. For context, my daughter is very little and she needs constant attention or she will get into trouble.

Venice has always been my wife's idea of a romantic city, so it's been her dream to go there. However, we can't just leave our daughter at home. We initially wanted to leave her at my MIL's house, but she wanted to come with us and my MIL said that it was her dream to visit too. My wife was very supportive of this idea, but I was more reluctant. My wife planned everything, booking the hotels and the restaurants.

However, to my dismay, she booked 1 rooms of 2 queens instead of two rooms with two kings. I planned for this to be a romantic getaway, and did not want my daughter in the room with us. We could easily afford two rooms, but my wife wanted to keep an eye on her as well.

To make matters worse, my MIL was constantly in my space. She also had to share all of my wife's expensive products (facewash, shampoo, lotion, etc).

My daughter likes to sit on our bed when me and my wife are gone to the city, and I come back to see that MIL was sitting on our bed too. It is very unhygienic to me and I don't like that she was sitting on the bed that me and my wife share, as I am a very private person. She also rummaged through our suitcase looking for a hair tie, and it really irked me that she did so without asking me. I don't like the thought of her looking through our stuff when we're gone, so I locked it.

The final straw was when I woke up in the morning, I saw that MIL has yet again, forgotten something. For the last few days, she's been sharing the same toothpaste as me and my wife! I don't like the thought of her putting her tooth brush close to (or even on) the toothpaste nozzle and I was ill the more I thought about it. I asked MIL if the only reason she came was to freeload off of me and my wife, as she didn't pay for any of the expenses (hotel, amenities, food), only her own plane tickets. I said that I've asked her politely several times to stop using my wife's stuff, especially because I share it with her and it's very inappropriate.

My MIL was very upset and told my wife, and my wife screamed at me. I was very angry that the trip that I paid with MY OWN MONEY was now ruined, and I changed the date of my plane ticket and went straight home. My wife has called me several times afterwards, screaming at me and saying that our daughter is upset. I feel bad that our daughter was caught in the situation, but it was really not acceptable what my MIL did and I had to set some boundaries before it gets worse.

My wife has her own card and enough money to stay there. I'm not sure about her plans about staying or not. I've been ignoring her calls to take sometime for my own mental health.

Edit: Thank you to everyone that responded. I'm reading through each response carefully and I have realized my mistakes. I'm taking tonight to write a sincere apology and I will be calling my wife first thing in the morning tomorrow. Thank you again. I love her more than anything and I want to make amends.

FINAL UPDATE: I just called my wife to deliver my sincere apology. I am writing this with a heavy heart. She has blocked my number, and my MIL informed me that she will be looking into divorce proceedings. I have never thought about this happening, and I am at a loss of what to do. I have failed our family, as a husband and as a father. I am not angry at my wife for this decision, but I still cling to the hope that I can turn this around. I am about to lose the love of my life, over a stupid mistake that I made. I was not rational when I stormed off. She did not deserve any of my attitude. I am praying at this moment that after sometime off and after I change myself for the better, she will reconsider this divorce. I am going to contact a therapist and marriage counselling after posting this. I feel myself spiraling and I don't want to think how I ruined my life in the span of these 48 hours.

Our 18 year old is going to a 4 year academic college.  My ex seems to think he now only has to pay for two children, plus thinks that since his alimony requirement has ended he now gets to pay less.  Our MSA gave him 78 overnight peg year.

116,1emyiq2,AITA for texting my employers very late in the evening?,"Long story short, I work part time at Chipotle in my hometown and have been working there for a few months. 

Stores not doing great, numbers are down, so they’ve been cutting hours. Last week, I was surprised to see that I had 0 hours for the upcoming week. 

I talked to the manager on duty, who then told me he would change the schedule, showed me a draft of the new schedule in which I had some hours, and I agreed. 

I didn’t get a good look at the schedule, but as it came to the start of the week, i texted the manager asking for a picture of the schedule. He replied quickly, sending me a photo of the old schedule with 0 hours for me, and told me to contact the General Manager. I was confused, as this guy was the one who gave me the new hours, but either way I texted the GM. This was around 10AM. No response from the GM, and now I was very anxious as I was supposedly supposed to work the next day. 

I sent another text at 1:30AM, asking the general manager very politely if they had seen my previous message, and no response. 

Today, I woke up to a text from the original manager I was talking with, that says (copy&pasted) 

“Unfortunately you have zero hours this week. You’re going to have to stop texting managers late at night about the schedule. Will let you know if anything changes.”

I was taken aback, mainly because I take pride in my jobs and don’t want to offend anyone, but that text tells me that not only were my GM and this manager talking about me, but the GM continued to ghost me and complained about my late night texts. 

AITA for just wanting to know my schedule? 


Follow up: Is it an age gap thing or maybe just lack of professional experience? If one of my friends, family, coworkers or managers messaged me late at night with a work related question and I woke up the next morning to it, I wouldn’t be offended and ever consider that as a “wake up and answer my text now” thing. People who think that’s an unreasonable or unprofessional time to text someone, is that why? Because it is seen/perceived as a demand to answer my message late at night?

117,1emybu4,AITA For “using” my stepmom for money?,"


So basically, my bum-ass father cheated on my mom when I was like 12. I'm currently 17. They got divorced, and my stepmom, who is now 30, was 25 when I was 12. I guess my loser of a father loves them young or something, I don't know. Well, my father and stepmom moved in together into a new house. My father has been wanting forgiveness from me, but hell no, bums don’t deserve forgiveness, which hurts him a lot, and I don't really care. I spend Tuesday, Wednesday, and sometimes Sunday at my father's and stepmom's house and the rest of the days I spend at my mom's.

My stepmom told me she didn’t know my father had a wife and kid when they started seeing each other. Sure, whatever. My stepmom has been treating me like her own child for the past five years. She hugs me a lot, which I don't mind to be honest; she has a soft chest, and she gives me kisses, basically affection like a mother to a son, which I just put up with. More importantly, she buys me a lot of stuff. Randomly, we'll go shopping together, and she'll just spend her money on things I want. She also gives me an allowance of like $200 a month. She says it's because she loves me and feels ashamed for ruining my family.

My stepmom works some high-paying job or something; I don't know, but the amount of money she spends is crazy. For example, yesterday was my birthday, and I turned 17. She got me 3 Pokémon booster boxes, which cost like $130-160 each (I like to collect Pokémon), fragrances (Versace Pour Homme, Dior Sauvage Eau de Parfum, and Stronger With You), and some clothes and shoes, which is crazy, lol.

To be honest, I tolerate my stepmother. The list of people I care most about in my family is, first, my own mother. Second, my stepmother, and last, my father.

I guess I’m writing this because I feel like I’m using my stepmom for money, but I still kinda love her. I don't know, my feelings are conflicted. My father recently told me that I should stop using my stepmom for money, but she defended me and said that she wants to give me whatever I want and that she enjoys doing it.

118,1emy4jp,AITA for confronting my friend/dogsitter for accusations she had made at my boyfriend and I regarding her dogs?,"My boyfriend (M25) and I (M24) have been friends with a woman (49F, let's call her Ashley) for about 2 years. We met at a dog park in September 2022, and my dog, Crash (2-year-old husky mix), immediately connected with her dog, Rose (2-year-old husky). Ashley also has another dog, Hunter (3-year-old foxhound mix). She has watched our dog many times, and we have watched her dogs as well. After her divorce earlier this year, Ashley moved closer to us, signing a 2-year lease so Rose and Crash could see each other more often. Ashley has often told us we are some of the only people she trusts with her dogs.

This past Friday, we were supposed to watch Rose while Hunter went out for agility training. Ashley frantically texted my boyfriend and me about the heat, suggesting we take Crash and Rose to an indoor dog park or our place. My boyfriend doesn't feel comfortable taking Crash to the indoor dog park (I was working and couldn't respond), so he planned to take Rose to Ashley's place to watch Crash and Rose there. Ashley texted back, saying she had already made alternate plans. My boyfriend called her to let her know we could still watch Rose, but she said it wasn't necessary.

During a doggie playdate this past Sunday, Ashley asked, ""Why isn't Rose allowed at your place?"" I explained we never said that and just had Oscar over. She ""forgot about that"" and felt better after I explained. She then said my boyfriend's text, ""uhhh, we'll just bring Crash to your place and watch Rose there,"" meant we were ""not valuing Rose's life and perfectly okay with Rose dying of heatstroke."" My boyfriend and I were extremely hurt — the accusation of not letting Rose over I could sort of see past, but the accusation that we were okay with Rose dying really shook me to my core.

I tried calling her later that day to talk about what happened. When I said she really hurt our feelings, she interrupted me sarcastically, saying, ""Ohhhh I'm sorry if the way I worded things wasn't good for your feelings."" She then started laughing hysterically and said, ""I'm not apologizing for standing up for myself. I said what I said because I meant every single word. The one time I stand up for myself and it's a problem. I'm not having this conversation,"" and then started crying and hung up. I haven't heard from her since, and my gut feeling is to not reach out again.

I was later told by her ex, whom she divorced suddenly earlier this year, that she had stopped taking her bipolar meds back in May. I'm not sure if I did anything wrong, or if there were things I could've said better, or if I was wrong for being upset at her standing up for herself, especially given she might be struggling with her mental health? I'm not sure if I'm giving her enough benefit of the doubt.

119,1emxt3q,AITA for spending money on myself instead of saving everything for the baby? ,"Long story short; me and my wife are expecting a baby next year. As a result, she has decided to stop shopping things for herself and save everything for the baby. As for myself, I would still like to be able to spend less than 10% of my total income on my hobby each month (fully expecting this to go down once the baby arrives due to a lack of time). She thinks I'm selfish and irresponsible for not ""prioritizing"" the baby enough as a result.

For some more background; I'm the one paying all the bills and the mortgage. She saves half that amount in our joint savings account, the rest she uses as she wishes (mainly travel, food and shopping). That means, after I've paid all the bills, I have maybe $200 to spend on myself, while she has $1000. This has been the case for the last 10 years. I don't mind, I get by just fine with $200.

With her deciding to stop shopping clothes and such for 2 months (which is something she had to do since her closest is already full to the point of bursting), she acts upset because I still buy things for myself, mostly with money that I've gotten by selling my old hobby stuff. Meanwhile, she is enjoying buying things for the baby, but apparently that does not count because it's not for her. She also thinks the fact that she has been allowed to spend 5x as much money as me over the years should not matter now that we have a baby on the way, and that if she needs to change her spending, then so do I.

When I point out that her not letting me spend any money of my own could be considered a form of ""financial abuse"" she gets defensive and says that I'm trying to force her to sell her clothes, when all I've said was she cannot keep buying clothes if there is nowhere to put them (it's gotten to the point that her clothes are now taking up an extra chair, the closet floor and even broke a closet shelf from the weight put on it) and that she needs to start selling or giving away old clothes if she expects to buy new ones.

And that's pretty much where we are at right now. I find that she cannot be reasoned with at currently. I'd also like to add that our finances are more than stable with plenty of money saved already, and that my hobby spending does not impact our economy negatively.

I enjoy adding my own personal flourish to the meals, usually something like putting toppings in the shape of a heart or drawing a cute face on a snack. It’s a fun hobby of mine, and it brings me joy later in the day to open my lunch and see it nicely arranged.

A few years ago, my sister-in-law (F33) had to take a lower-paying job after an accident left her unable to work at her previous one. I began making her meals like I did for my husband and myself as I knew she was struggling both financially and emotionally. She lives very close to us, so my husband always just dropped them off on his commute to work. I always added my extra touch to her meals as well, as I enjoy cooking and figured it would be a nice thing to do.

However she called me a few months ago and asked if I could stop making her lunches so bourgeois. I legitimately thought she was joking calling a heart-shaped piece of seaweed bourgeois, but according to her, none of her colleagues at work have such elaborate lunches, and it makes her feel as if she is flaunting her status.

She is not paying me for the lunches and it takes me an extra ten minutes maximum to add a fun touch to them, so I was confused on her train of thought. I thought that maybe her coworkers were taking her lunch and she didn’t want to tell me, but I agreed to make the lunches less fancy because I wanted her to feel comfortable.

Since I make the exact same meals for all three of us, now I just don’t put effort into the presentation of one of them. Since my husband drops off the lunch on his way to work, there has been one or two times where he has accidently given her the wrong box. I have labelled which lunch is not flourished, but in the rush of the commute there is still the occasional instance of taking the wrong box.

My sister-in-law asked me a few days ago if I could just stop making both me and my husband’s lunches “fancy”, due to the risk of her being given the wrong one. I refused, as it makes me happy to see the extra touch of personality in the food and told her that she wouldn’t die from one accidental “fancy” meal, which she was furious at and hung up on me.

She has been refusing to talk to me over the past few days and when I tried to call her to reason she kept hanging up. She has told my husband that she will only talk to me if I agree to stop making all of our lunches so “bourgeois”.

I am still making her lunches every day and my husband dropping them off, and while my husband agrees with me that her demand was out of order, he has now said that maybe I should just make all the food less flourished just so that she will not be angry if there is an accidental swap of lunches. I know it would be easy on me to just not flourish the food, but I don't want to give up my hobby for a theoretical chance of her recieving the wrong box. AITA for refusing?

Edit: This is out of character behavior for my SIL. She is usually a very sweet and considerate person, she watches my daughter for free, and has never been so reactionary about a lunch before.

121,1emxm3d,AITA for refusing to be driven by my girlfriend who just drank?,"
Hi guys, I have been reading a lot of these posts recently and I have finally experienced something I'd like some input on.

I (24M) and my GF(24F) were enjoying dinner with some Sangria and after dinner my GF said she'd like to get some ice cream from  the store. That said, I was feeling the alcohol (I'm a light weight) and she claims to have no effects from the alcohol (she claims to be a heavyweight).  When I asked if she can drive, she said she can because she doesn't feel anything.  I then agreed to come grab ice cream with her.  As we were walking out the door, she again says she is not tipsy and wants to drink another glass of Sangria before we hit the road, in her words 'to get tipsy'.  At this point I decided I don't want to drink with her if she is drinking to intentionally get tipsy and drive.  This is where things went south...

I told her if she gets another,  I will not come with her.  She took offense to this saying that 'it won't kick in til she gets to the store' and that she is a heavyweight and she wouldn't put herself in danger.  I then stood my ground, and she did grab another glass, further calling me a 'ninny' and an 'asshole'.  And went off the the store.

I didn't like being called names, and was admittedly a bit angry at the fact...  As a result, although I did think to check up on her during her ride to the store, I did not, due to my anger,  which I can admit to was not a good thing on my part...  

With that being said, I feel it is never a bad thing to refuse to drive with someone who has just drank, even if they say they are fine to drive, just as an abundance of caution.

As a reference the amount drank was about 3 wine glasses of sangria.  And the distance to the store was about 2.5 miles.

So although in my anger I did not check up on my GF, am I the asshole for refusing to drive with her to grab ice cream?

123,1emxfpv,AITA for walking down a broken escalator?,"This happened about a week ago now

I work in a retail store in a large shopping mall, on the third floor. Where the store is situated, it is easily accessible by a set of escalator stairs, the moving stairs which take you up or down. This is usually really great, as it allows traffic to our store, and makes getting to work on time really convenient. Unfortunately, these escalators have been having problems for a number of months now. At first the escalators which take you upwards broke down, preventing me from getting to the store by taking them, meaning I either had to wait for the usually very busy elevator, or walk around the entire mall to a different set, and then loop back to the store. I did this until the escalator was fixed, but then literally a week later the ""downwards"" escalators broke down, and this is where the trouble started.

In order to get down from work I, once again, had to wait for the crowded elevator, or loop around to a really inconvenient escalator on the other side of the mall. This literally was costing me 4-5 minutes every time, and after how long it took to fix the first time, and given how we literally pay rent to stay in a mall which can't even be bothered to fix its escalator, I just decided to walk down the broken set. It's literally the same thing as a regular set of stairs when it isn't moving. Obviously, they don't really want you to do this, and it was as such protected with a fabric barrier. I just ducked under the barrier and walked down, and low and behold, nothing exploded, no one died, and I saved a bunch of time. So naturally, I did this a few more times when I was in a rush, until one night when a security guard whistled at me to come over.

The guard reprimanded me and quite unprofessionally told me I can't walk down the escalator even after I tried to explain my reasons. He told me I was ""technically trespassing"" when I went under the barrier and that I could get in serious trouble. I tried to argue that the other escalator which is going up has people on it every day not 5 feet away from the broken downwards one, and somehow that's not trespassing. He then started almost shouting at me and said he has seen me do it before which just made me confused because if he had seen me before then why did he wait until now to say something. By this point I was irritated and basically told him that if the mall owners cared so much about the broken escalator maybe they should fix it already at which point he said he would report me to my boss at the store and advise the mall officials that an employee from my store was trespassing on the broken escalator. I thought the whole situation was completely ridiculous and blown way out of proportion, but I understand he was doing his job and I have quite possibly created more work for him.

125,1emxcb6,WIBTA for telling my friend she’s crazy?,"(All fake names) Okay so I (19F) have this friend (we’ll call her Rose, 22F), who is also my coworker. We started talking back in December and got closer ever since. She started dating our coworker (Cody, 22M) about 3 months ago. They are super cute together and I’m so happy for them. The only thing that bothers me about her is how much she complains about never being able to see him, how much she misses him all the time and how they are “long distance”. I get missing your partner, trust me I do but it’s a bit much when she does it because she see him every day, at work and after work too. Like today she told me “He’s been sending me reels all day saying how much he wants to cuddle me! It’s so sweet! I know it’s only been 6 hours since we saw each other last but that’s way too long for both of us.“ and I texted back “awww that’s so sweet! Y’all are to much!!! I’m so happy for you Rose! Making me jealous over here.” 

A little back story, I’ve been dating my current boyfriend (Jim, 22m) for almost 3 months. He’s a truck driver, and not an instate one. He drives out of state every day.

Okay so she texted back to me “You just spent a week with Jim soooo.” And that really pissed me off. Me and Jim only see each other Monday and Tuesday before he leave for the week again. I can’t text him much since he’s either driving from 2:30am to 1:30pm or sleeping until 12am, and by that time I’m usually asleep cause I’m an early bird. We try to call but I have to run errands and go to appointments so most of the time it’s a 10 minute call in the morning before I leave to start getting stuff done for the day and go to work. I was very lucky to get that week with him, and we were planing that trip about a month and a half ago. 

I feel like I’m an asshole because I know what it’s like missing your other half but at the same time I feel like her saying they are long distance even tho they see each other every day is a bit crazy. If anything me and my partner are long distance. 

And before anyone asks or says “why don’t you just tell her? She’s your friend”, technically I would tell her something but not when it comes to something she said. The response I would get is “Oh you’re right, I’m a terrible friend. I can’t do anything right.

126,1emww5z,AITA for telling my son's mom that she deserved to be cussed at and should apologize to our son?,"My middle son Alex is 10. He was a total mama's boy until age 6 when he swung hard into being a daddy's boy. My ex and I divorced around that time. At least around me, my kids are not particularly modest. We're just four dudes who like being cold. 

Last week Alex broke his leg after slipping on the stairs. He was with me that week and I had to help him get into the bath, wash him (I'm afraid he'll fall trying to wash on one foot) and help him dress (just faster if I do it).

My kids went to their moms yesterday and she called me saying that Alex cussed her out. Alex is the sweetest kid in the world. He can get emotional but not angry emotional. I asked what happened and she casually mentioned she was going to help him take a bath and he told her to get the fuck out of the bathroom. I asked if was naked and she said obviously and he was fighting with her about helping him. 

I said you messed up. He doesn't want you in the bathroom when he's in the tub naked let alone you trying to help him. I said I bet you didn't even knock when you went into the bathroom.

She said ""oh so it's my fault?"" I said yes it is your fault. He's 10 not 4. You were quite thoughtless. If he were a girl, then I would ask what he was comfortable with and not barged in.

She told me she thinks he should have no Xbox for a week and since it would overlap with my time she wanted my cooperation. I said no. If anything you should apologize to him and acknowledge that you messed up. Then he'll apologize for cussing and cry and never do it again.

She says she can't believe my stance. 

Edit: My son needs help bathing if he has to stand up because he will fall over. He doesn't need help if he's sitting in the tub with his legs over the edge of the tub.

Recently, we both entered relationships with two best friends (14M, 14M), all four of us would hang out, and we would all facetime together. This went on for 4 months before my best friend left her boyfriend. (As of now, I am still with mine and we are happily celebrating 5 months today.)

In my relationship, I mentioned to my boyfriend that I was close with one of my ex boyfriends. We had broken up almost 2 years ago and had worked things out. He respected this and I offered to let them meet, which he accepted. Now, they're like best friends.

I also mentioned this to my best friend, as her (now ex) boyfriend is on my exes football team. She started acting all flustered, which I thought was weird. I told her about how he's extremely fit, working out in his spare time, he's on a football, basketball, and wrestling team. She asked to see a photo, so I showed her.

I told her it's okay to talk to him, but the amount of time and how fast she's growing close with him made me very uncomfortable with everything.

She would leave me on read, pay rent and utilities late and has a dog pissing and shitting all over my apartment. That’s right. I found meds in the kitchen for dog diarrhea and come home to dog pee on the floor and my living room rug. I also can’t sit on my couch because it’s covered in dog hair. I open the washer? You guessed it. Dog hair. Go to the bathroom? Toilet seats up with pee and pubes everywhere. Take a shower? There’s DIRT in the tub. Excuse me what? How are you dirty getting out of the shower??? Did I mention this giant man has been working on getting a job but at the same time plays video games on his dual screens and has a puppy? Well I have said many times now that this man and dog is not ok living at the apartment. Nothing is happening and it has been over 3 months now and I have 5 more months on the lease but this dog is also ruining the apartment. Did I mention when the dog is alone it screams and scratches the door? Like even when this dude goes to the bathroom. Help. ",0.0,-0.0009228747803717,0,1
130,1emwdhh,AITA my ex (30 M) has been infiltrating my (33 F) family,"
I've never really used reddit before, but constantly see those youtube videos of people getting great advice so... figured I'd give it a whirl.

My ex-husband and I have been split since 2021, and I will not lie, we have had our rough patches and hurt feelings. But for the most part our divorce was amicable and we coparent pretty well together, with rare disagreements on raising our son. 

Now, my ex-husband is from out of state, and moved to the state I live in after I lived in his state for some time and did not like it. His family is not necessarily the best, neither are parts of mine, but he really does not care about them. After he moved here he did not speak to his parents for two years, and I had to coax him to even do that. I get it though, I do. And because of that he made a good relationship with my dad and step mom. I understand. 

However. Since we have split, he is still attending my family functions. At first I still went because my son was there and it was my family, but it was so hard to be around him. It hurt. So I stopped going to my own family gatherings because they would always invite him. And yes, I did talk to them about this. I asked them to stop. And they said they would but they never do.

I went into a deep depression, I finally worked through things and I don't have any feelings for him, so 2023 Thanksgiving, I went even though he was there. It was fine but still felt wrong and just like my space was invaded. Like I was forced to spend time with him, when I shouldn't have to.

Fast forward to December and we do not spend Christmas together because he treated me like shit honestly, so I told him not to fucking come. He said I can't uninvite him to family stuff and I told him he wasn't family. I know this sounds petty, but I should be able to enjoy my Christmas without having to deal with him I feel like, especially after we had just fought the day before and he had called me a bunch of names. 
Well in January he tells me he's got a new girlfriend. She's from his home state, so I figured he would move back there. Nope. He's moving here up here. I don't know when. All I know is that I already have asked him NOT to bring her around my family gatherings and he has already done it. He introduced her to all of them, they had a barbecue. 

Now this weekend I just found out she is bringing her three kids up here and he asked my step mom to watch them so they can go to a concert at the state fair. 

I feel like no one is listening to me. My ex isn't, my family isn't. I feel like I can't even go to my own family events because I am so uncomfortable with him there, and now whenever she moves up here, he's not going to listen to me and she's going to be there, and my family will welcome her as ""part of the family.""

Am I being selfish? Am I overreacting? I just can't help but feel so fucking alone and like I'm an outcast, replaced by my ex in my own family. Am I being an asshole for not wanting him or her to be a part of my family gatherings?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-08,"AITA my ex (30 M) has been infiltrating my (33 F) family

Initially I was okay with friendship but over time he has come to not respect my boundaries and completely disregard things that make me uncomfortable.

All of my other friends respect this except for him.

He makes me feel like absolute crap for this and it really sucks. Most of the time I even cave and agree to meet him somewhere for a quick ice cream or boba or something along those lines to avoid a potential conflict. All of my other friends have been very understanding of this and that makes me feel way more comfortable to the point where I don’t necessarily mind seeing them and spending a couple hours with them here and there. On top of all of this, he also sometimes makes advances towards me/asks me to hang out at my house which I am absolutely not comfortable with at all due to our past. I have explained this to him and it has gotten better but he is still always trying to “just come pick me up” which I’ve also said I don’t like, as I know he will always try to make me let him come inside, but he keeps asking and it’s very irritating to me. We broke up because he would never want me around and always ditched me for other people, and always said I made him uncomfortable (even though I wasn’t ever around him because he wouldn’t ever want to spend time together) and the fact that he now wants everything to do with me also irritates me.

132,1emw15h,AITA for asking my partner to help clean our apartment?,"
For background, I (F21) have lived with my partner (M22) for the past two years. We've been dating for four years and lived together in my apartment and our dorm rooms before that. He has only lived with his parents before, and both of us are in university. I’m starting grad school this fall.

For the past two years, I've been responsible for menu planning, cooking, cleaning, and helping him get organized. I became independent at a young age and had to teach him many of these skills when we moved in together, as he had no experience with cooking or cleaning. I have worked in restaurants and summer camps and come from a family where my mom was a professional cleaner.

Recently, our apartment has become very disorganized. We both play sports and work (he works part-time), but the clutter has been overwhelming. I've expressed my frustration and tried to keep up, but it's been difficult, especially since I’ve been dealing with thyroid cancer symptoms, fatigue, working 40 hours a week, and managing all the chores and cooking.

I asked him to help out, especially since he spends his days off playing video games, surrounded by filth, leaving dishes and garbage everywhere. When I ask him to tidy, he claims it’s his day off and he shouldn't have to do anything. I understand the need for rest, but I just ask that he tidies up after himself a bit.

Tonight, he got upset because I mentioned having company over and wanting to clean the house. He says he doesn't help because he feels he does it wrong. He cited an example where I criticized his dishwashing skills, and now he refuses to do them. I explained that I only correct him when health is at risk, such as leaving food and soap on dishes, but he said he doesn’t care and won’t do them again.

He grew up with a dishwasher and claims he can’t wash dishes because we don’t have one. I told him this is our reality, and we need to manage. I approached this with understanding, figuring he didn’t know how due to his background. However, he now says he doesn't want to clean or tidy and doesn't feel like this is his house because he fears doing it wrong. I said the only wrong thing is not doing anything and that I'd be happy with any effort.

He accused me of always wanting my way and began to yell and cry, then stopped talking to me.

I feel I can stand up to them when they say outrageous things or are continually rude/have no manners because it seems no one else does.

They said that they would stay at our house with her overnight. Said vacation is in a few days.

Three weeks ago my grandmothers health started to decline. My father came up to stay with them, and at the time said he would still be able to take care of the dog. In the last five days her health has taken a rapid decline, and on Monday my mother flew in to help in taking care of her too.

Today we were told that this turn of events though meant that they were no longer and to stay overnight to watch the dog, only leave three times a day to take care of her for an hour or so each. This is because my grandmother needs care during the night such as diaper changes, and my mother is too weak to move and position her by herself and needs my dad's help to change her or help move her in any other way. My dad also says he will absolutely not be leaving his mother overnight because of how bad her heart issues are, and wants to be there in case it goes bad quickly.

I agree with this in its entirety. The dog can't be left alone overnight because she's never been alone overnight her entire life and she'll most certainly be destructive, but my dad's mother is pretty much dying and I can't tell him he has to leave her to watch our dog.

My wife, on the other hand, **STRONGLY** disagrees.

She is furious that they went back on their promise, and said that they've ""Royally fucked us"" by making this decision. She says if she were in this position she would do whatever physically possible to fulfill her obligation, because that's how she was raised. She says what they've done is scummy, and is another reason she can't trust them (In the past when watching the dog my dad was four hours late feeding her, my wife found out by watching him come and go on the ring camera).

For context her grandfather just went through this same decline four months ago and passed. In light of that she says she would still follow through on a promise she made, especially one she made ""A whole fucking year ago.""

I've told her I can't agree with her on this, and she's furious at me now too, claiming I don't care about our dog. The current idea too is that I don't go on the vacation with them, and just have her and our baby go for the week while I stay home. That decision has made her even more angry since ""Because of them I don't get to go on a fucking family vacation with my husband.""

Am I being an asshole by siding with my parents here? I've also made it clear that this isn't me giving them a pass because they're my parents, but I genuinely think the promise made to us does not matter as much as this emergent circumstance, and that I would feel the same no matter who it was.

Tl;Dr: my parents promised to watch our dog during my family's vacation, but my grandmother is dying so they said they can't watch overnight anymore. I agree, but my wife thinks they are being scumbags.

  
UPDATE: A solution has been reached. On further discussion, my parents are willing to take our dog back to my grandmother's house with them when they visit her the final time in the evening, and keep her in the bedroom they're sleeping in overnight, and then in the morning when they would usually be driving over to feed her anyways, they would just take her back to our house. I don't think they owe us this accommodation, but I greatly appreciate their effort to make this work. My wife still believes that they owed it to us to make it work and is annoyed that we had to think of that solution and they didn't volunteer it so our initial disagreement remains, but at least the problem has been solved.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-08,"AITA for agreeing that my parents forgo a promise made to my wife and I because my grandmother is very sick?

139,1emugxo,WIBTA for moving out because of a dog?,"I (17M) want to move out of my house bc 1 of our dogs poops/pees on the floor. I live with my mom, 3 dogs, and 3 cats. The dog in question's back legs don't work well anymore and he can't get out the doggy door, so he poops/pees on the floor if he can't get outside in time. This happens 3-4x a week, sometimes multiple times a day, and has been happening for more than a year. 

I'm the one who has to clean up after him 80% of the time and I'm sick of it, so I've been seriously considering moving out. My entire life we've had dogs and cats but I'm allergic to dogs and am not really a pet person. My mom acknowledges that besides my cat, all of the other animals are hers, which is why it's so frustrating to me that I have to take care of the poop dog most of the time. Also, the poop dog is mean, bites us/the other dogs, and obviously desecrates our house. My mom is a big animal person so I think that instead of euthanizing him, she's just waiting until nature takes its course so she doesn't have to be the one to put him to sleep.

When I've expressed my being fed up with the dog poop, she's been very dismissive and has argued with me for wanting to put the dog down. This has damaged my relationship with her so I've been spending more time at my friends' houses/aunt and uncle's house than at home for the past 4 or so months. This July, I studied abroad for 3 weeks, which was really relieving as far as a housing situation bc my host family didn't have any pets, but before I left I was close to reaching the same conclusion of moving out. Now that I'm home, I've just been angry all the time because the same problems have been happening, in and outside of the dog situation.

My mom is a lot messier than I am (not like a hoarder or anything but just messy) and I also am the one who keeps things tidy. It's really embarrassing having my friends come over and see dog feces on the floor, on top of her pre-existing mess. Also, I recently learned some things about my mom from my aunt in regards to her being estranged from the rest of our family, specifically my siblings, that I was completely in the dark about since 5 or 6 years old, which has also damaged my relationship with her. This wouldn't be the first time she's chosen something else over my siblings/me (when I was 10-12 she chose my abuser over me) and I don't know, now that I'm old enough to really reflect on it, I've been feeling really disturbed and uncomfortable living at home.

If I were to move out I would live with my aunt and uncle for my senior year and 2 years of community college. If I didn't move out, I'd be living with my mom for 3 more years, and I don't know if I can keep doing it for my mental health. But, I don't know.. does this alone constitute moving out? Should I just wait until I graduate from high school and go from there? I feel really lost and confused right now.

140,1emufgc,"AITA for reaching out to my best friends boyfriends ex wife, to get info on him?","For context: I’m a lesbian, my best friend is bisexual. We dated in our early 20s and lost touch after she got married. She got divorced in 2021 and reached out to me and we have been inseparable ever since. 

My (34f) best friend (32f) started dating a new guy (30m) in early June 2024 and ever since she has changed so much. This is the first guy she’s dated since she got divorced 3 years ago. I started noticing changes in her immediately after their first date. She is a very career driven person and is currently working on her masters. Since meeting him she’s skipped out on work to be able to spend time with him multiple times and had to drop one of her classes because she skipped 2 weeks of homework because of him. She has NEVER dropped a class and it’s extremely out of character for her. Also, she has a 12 year old daughter and had made clear boundaries for herself for when she started dating. Such as, not introducing him to her for a few months, not letting him stay the night when she’s home, etc. After 2 weeks of dating she didn’t want to not be able to see him so she introduced him to her daughter and he stayed the night that very night. His lease was up on his rent home at the end of July and he had nowhere to go so now he’s living with her. She owns her home. She’s also not making him pay any bills. And not to mention, our friendship has  been affected by this guy. We used to spend every single day together. I would come over after work and cook dinner with her and her daughter, we would watch our show and then I would go home and I was there pretty much all weekend, every weekend. Now we have been going weeks without seeing each other. I’m not going to lie at first I was a little bit upset that she was pushing me to the side for this dude that she barely knew. But now I’m more worried for her than anything. After telling her that I was upset about not seeing her she planned a day for us to have a best friend day. While we were having our day, he was constantly texting her making her feel bad for not spending that time with him, and he was telling her that he thought that it was weird that I didn’t want to meet him yet. They had only been dating for like three weeks at this point and I didn’t feel the need to meet some guy that is irrelevant. That was a big red flag for me although it didn’t seem to phase my friend. Which is also out of character for her because she doesn’t put up with anybody’s bullshit. I ended up giving in for her and hung out with them one day at her house. It was so freaking awkward. He was all over her the entire time and I just felt very uncomfortable. I should mention that he has told her that he has an issue with the fact that we used to date and we spend so much time together. But that was like 13 years ago and it’s not like that anymore with her and I. I do believe he was trying to make me jealous by being all over her though. But like I said it’s not like that with me and her anymore so all that did was give me a bad first impression of him. I have tried to talk to her multiple times about the changes in her personality and her values and morals and the changes in our friendship and she is not having it. She just shuts me down every time. So after this last time of trying to get through to her, I did some sleuthing and found his ex-wife that he has 3 kids with on Facebook. Not sure her age. Oh yeah and he doesn’t have shared custody of his kids. His mom and his ex have shared custody. Red flag number 36. Anyway, I messaged her asking if she has any information on him and how he was because from everything that I have gathered so far, he seems extremely toxic and potentially controlling/abusive. But that plan backfired on me, and instead of her giving me information she went and told him that I messaged her. So now my best friend is extremely upset with me and is telling me that I took it too far and won’t speak to me. But I’m just worried for her and her daughter’s safety.

For some context, we met at church and have been best friends since. A few months ago when I started planning my Sweet 16, I asked him to help me with some ideas. I had wanted to get people dressed up really fancy and came up with games and a spaghetti bar for the party. When I asked him for some ideas he said, ""those are the stupidest ideas I've ever heard of."" I thought he was joking, so I kept pitching ideas. But then he said ""No, I'm being serious. These ideas are stupid and I'm not going to come if you do these."" We got in a huge argument over it.

About a month later I had my party, and John spent the whole time complaining. He made us all sit in a circle and talk about his relationship problems. He also insisted I ""shut up"" because he was being vulnerable. I would have totally listened if he didn't stop my entire birthday to talk about himself. But no, we can't have a private conversation, it has to be at my party which I spent weeks planning, for John to just come in and say my ideas were stupid.

At first I excused his petty behavior, because I did enjoy hanging out with him. But then he made fun of my boyfriend at the time, and then laughed at me when we broke up. He would send me pictures of him and make fun of me because things didn't work out. He's white, and would scream the n-word out of my car window.

There was a period in my 20s that I was wrapped up in a very toxic relationship that she didn’t approve of (for good reason) and it strained our relationship until I moved back home at 26. Two years later I had my son and it seemed to bring us closer together. For the last 6 years we have been each others rock. I’ve always gone to her for advice and guidance as a parent and she’s always been so supportive. It’s been a rough few years for her. She’s had some bad lows and I’m there for her as best as I can be while also being a mom, wife, and home maker. I have never expressed that she was a burden or that I didn’t want to continue helping her. I love her dearly but there are times that she’ll put too much expectations and pressures on me. My son is starting Kindergarten soon and we are all so excited for him. The problem is that he will be going to a school near me in our city, My mom lives in another city but isn’t too far from us (about 30 mins drive depending on traffic) and she’s upset at me for not having him go to a school in her city. I did that for two years driving back and forth between cities every day. I would be driving a total of 2 hours a day and it’s so limiting and exhausting. She’s upset that she won’t get to see him as often and assumes I wouldn’t make an effort for them to spend time together. She’s been putting a lot of guilt on me because of this and I spoke up about it. I validate her feelings but I need to do what is best for my child. Was I in the wrong in all of this?

We ended up in this after-hour, sketchy club. I was standing behind my boyfriend, holding hands with him while he was in front chatting with other people when a guy approached me. As usual, I told him that I have a boyfriend and wasn’t interested in talking but he was still persistent, making me really uncomfortable. I decided to get my boyfriend’s help and pulled his arm to get his attention. But I was surprised that as I pulled his hand, he slightly shook my hand off. I didn’t have time to react with anything else then I heard his friend asking me if I was okay and pulled me aside. I was surprised by what my boyfriend did, considering that he had been always protective of me whenever we were out in clubs, knowing that I’m not familiar with the environment and that I’m small and an easy target. As I kept thinking about it, I got more and more upset as I couldn’t understand his action, especially in this shady club. So later when we went outside the club and there were only the two of us, I told him “You wasn’t there for me. There was a guy harassing me and your friend had to come and help me.” That clearly really upset him and he started asking me what were I taking about and what guy. When I explained the situation he told me I probably didn’t do enough to notify him then because he didn’t even know about it and that I probably secretly liked the attention and were entertaining the guy until it became out of my control. I knew right there and then that these words are major red flag but let’s ignore this issue here. He also told me that I was being disrespectful by bring his friend in like that, basically comparing the two of them. He said that it was nothing for me to praise his friend about because they are friends and he would absolutely do the same to the friend’s girlfriend if she needs help and it just something they supposed to do for each other/each other’s girlfriends. He said I was wrong for undermining him and made his friend out to be this hero saving the day.

So my best friend since childhood recently started seeing this guy. I've been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years now. Yesterday on her birthday she was over here with me and my boyfriend and we were watching a horror movie. Right up the road is this little abandoned graveyard because we live down a dirt road and there's like four houses on this road. We went up there and she got scared so she jumped and hold it onto my boyfriend and was all flirty. Then we found out that she likes my boyfriend's dad who looks exactly like my boyfriend. I jokingly said I wouldn't be shocked if she had a thing for you talking to my boyfriend while she was in the car with us. She did that nod that us girls do when we agree. I was already upset because we're all teenagers and my parents are throwing her birthday party but won't throw me a birthday party. I feel like they like her more than me because they also got her a hoodie saying it's official I'm the favorite daughter. I now feel like my best friend that I've known since first grade like my boyfriend. I talked to her about it and she just she doesn't remember any of it. Keep in mind I'm trying to spend as much time with my boyfriend as I can because he's leaving the 28th for Texas possibly until next year but she's complaining because I'm hanging out with him she says that I should be hanging out with her. She also says what she's done isn't flirty and it's completely normal and I can't be mad at her. Am I overreacting for being mad. Also we all should be hanging out this Friday or Saturday since Saturday is her party I'll update then.

Edit: my best friend has made flirty remarks to me about my boyfriend's dad when he looked exactly like my boyfriend. When he was younger my boyfriend's dad had same hairstyle everything like looked exactly the same if the date wasn't on the picture I wouldn't have known. And she was saying that she would have sex with him and then continue to say that she had a dream about it. When I was like hey that's a little weird she said no it's completely normal. She also agrees with my mother that I'm getting fat and try telling me that my boyfriend would leave me when he's the entire reason why I've gained weight. Keep in mind I'm 5'5 and 145

Strangely i said yes. I hate wedding showers, but I agreed to plan one since I was the MOH. After the party multiple people said it was awesome. Jill said I didn't put enough effort into it, but I shrugged it off as her being stressed. She wanted help with our dresses, I told her about the ones a friend had and she got ALMOST THE EXACT DRESS! The only difference is these are shin length not knee. I asked if the MOH could have a different length, she said she didn't want her MOH looking like a slut so I had to buy a new dress. 3 weeks before the wedding she calls & says I haven't been supportive of her & Jack so she doesn't want me in the wedding.

149,1emsfit,AITA: MY HUSBANDS FAMILY WILL NOT USE A NICKNAME FOR MY SON,"My husband and I struggled with coming up for a name for a son. So much so that we got to the 10 day postpartum mark and screaming and crying about the name in the hospital parking lot until moments before we had to decide in order to avoid him having extra paper work attached to his paper work for the rest of his life. We ended up on deciding to calm him a The Second of his husbands name. I personally don’t like his name. It’s a fine name but not one I would choose for my son. His middle name is his mothers maiden so I asked to change it atleast to mine and he said no and in that moment with all th hormones… I felt I had no choice for the sake of my son. 

Two years later…. It’s still an order. I came up with a nickname based on my husbands last name but he didn’t like it as I guess people called his father it is the past. 

His family refused to call my son anything other than my husbands first name. They won’t say lil or big to reference them and it gotten to the point that it drives me nuts! Having to listen to context, clues in regards to each conversation and figure out who people are listening to is driving me insane. 

So now I have gone to my husband and said I can’t take it. Evidently the lil and big request will not work and we are now asking people to calm him by an entirely different nickname (RJ) so I can not flip my shit. 

His family is saying I am out of line, but I just can’t do it. Why should I always be subjected to being alert and listen to context cues? Especially when every time I see them I am on vacation due to them living travel distance away. That point I guess really doesn’t matter, but it’s like I am supposed to relax and instead I have to be stressed and paying attention like at work in corporate job for casual conversations. His mother went as far as saying, he will never call my son a name other than the one on his birth certificate.

Additionally, in return, my husband expects

1. For him and my eldest son to still be able to call him by his name.
2. For me to complete let go of the nickname I loved for my son.

Additionally, we live close to my family and they respect using both my husband’s name as well as my nickname for my son prior to the change. I told them we are going to be requesting others to call him a different nick name now and they have been receptive but definitely questioning the decision. 

Is this reasonable? Am I being irrational or out of line?

It is a backrooms porn game where the monsters are pornogrgraph. It isn't fully finished but he has gotten bored and wants to move onto another game.

I am cool with him making these kind of games but his current idea is a but problematic. It is a zombie game kinda like project zomboid, but all the zombies are sexy women. The ""plot"" is basically that a zombie virus got released that kills all the men and turns women into sexy zombies. The surviors are immune to the virus. Yes, he plans on the zombies being fuck able.

We were at my pool swimming when he brought it up. I told him that it might be a bad idea, and that it is kinda just necrophila. He said other games are worse and it is fine. In response I called him Corpse Fucker, or CF for short. I sometimes call him CF in public and if anyone were to ask what it means I would say it stands for Coding Friend.

Am I the asshole for trying to prove the point that maybe he doesn't want to be associated with Necrophila?",Asshole,2024-08-08,"AITA for giving my friend an offensive nickname?

153,1encilf,AITA for not agreeing to a change in sleeping arrangements?,"I went on a Vegas with my brother (Michael) and two friends (Andy and Derek). We got a standard room with two queen beds for the four of us because we’re cheap af. The initial plan was for Andy and Derek to share a bed and my brother and I to share the other, which we did the first night. Derek is a bit on the bigger side so their bed was a little cramped but they seemed to have slept fine. The next day, we were at a roulette table and I turned to Michael and said “if the next spin lands on red you’re sleeping on the floor” and we shook on it. It landed on red and Michael honored the bet. When we got back to the room at night, Andy asked if we could share a bed instead. I said nah I’d rather not so he went into bed with Derek. I felt bad but also didn’t want to give up my personal space. The next morning all was well but I did notice a bit of side eyeing from Andy.
