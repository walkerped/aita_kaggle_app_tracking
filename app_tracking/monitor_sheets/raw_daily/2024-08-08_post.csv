0,1en1w0b,AITA for answering honestly about me being trans?,"My aunt (31 F, aka “Jane”) isn’t my biological aunt. She’s been in my life since I was born. This happened in April, and my aunt Jane is still ignoring me (18 trans M). We used to be very close before she met her now-husband (43 M, aka Joe). Jane and I used to be VERY close, as I considered her like a second mother. Joe came into the picture when I was 16, but nothing between Jane and I changed, until the day of the wedding. Now the problem…

Before the ceremony, Joe, best man, and Joe’s son (16 M, aka Luke) had to run to Jane’s home to get her camera. The whole ride was a bit awkward, as I was in the middle-back seat beside Luke. I’d never spoken to him before, as he was a child from Joe’s previous relationship… we made small talk, and I was under the impression that he wasn’t put off by me wearing a suit. Luke had suddenly asked “Are you transgender?” out of nowhere. Now, I’m pre-testosterone, meaning my voice and looks are very feminine and I haven’t had any surgery. While under this impression he wasn’t bothered, I answered truthfully “Yes, I’m a trans guy.” but I didn’t know my Aunt Jane told no one at the wedding (besides Joe and people who already knew me outside of Jane) that I was a trans guy. Luke’s response was “oh great, now I’m uncomfortable.” This really caught me off guard, and I was hurt because I was trying to get along with Luke. 

I said nothing for the rest of the ceremony, since I was insecure of making more people uncomfortable. After people went inside to the venue, I stayed outside and went off to the side to let myself cry so I could calm down before facing anyone again. Long story short, my mother (42 F) found me crying and hugged me until I admitted what had me so upset. My mother wanted to go ballistic, but I begged to just leave because I was horrified by making people uncomfortable.

2 weeks later, after Jane and Joe returned from their honeymoon my mother broke the news of what happened between Luke and I. Needless to say, Jane had no reaction but Joe definitely did. Despite how well Joe and I got along, he turned out to be transphobic. He mocked, insulted, and said some slurs towards me, and went as far as saying I was disgusting. He claimed Luke did nothing wrong, and I needed to grow thicker skin and was a snowflake. Now I feel conflicted, I’m happy for Jane’s successful day, but pissed with Joe. But regardless, they all started ignoring me after this.

I’ve been out of the closet as trans for 5 years now, and I’ve never had someone act THIS transphobic. I’m also hurt by my aunt not defending me at all, she never messaged or called or spoke to me to ask if I was okay, or even to plan anything with me. I feel like I was just pushed out of my best friend’s life. I tried calling, and I was ignored. I was sent nothing but an apology from Luke, but it was obvious he didn’t write it.. Luke shared views with Joe, and the way he said he wasn’t transphobic was practically a joke. AITA?

1,1emyyvg,AITA for asking my partner not to sleep with someome?,"Hi, I (29m) and my partner 29(mtf if that matters?) Have been together for about 3 years now. In the last couple months they asked to open the relationship because I wasn't ""putting out"" enough for them. I reluctantly agreed. At first it actually seemed to be beneficial for us as we were talking more and just generally were happier! So, I get 2 days off a week and they work their own schedule. The problem arose because during both my days off this week, they decided to go out and hook up with strangers. I didn't mind as much the first day as it's whatever we have another day to spend together. Then, they proceeded to do the same again on my other.  I even asked earlier in the day if they'd stay home and spend the day with me since I'll be working for the next several days and they can do what they want then. They insisted and went out during the day. Later on, I asked for them not to go out again. They proceeded to get annoyed with me and got upset over me restricting them from ""going out and being social"". I felt like they didn't care about me wanting time with them. They excused it with ""I spend so much time with you as it is. I want to go out and be social"". They ended up asking for space and I left the apartment for an hour and came back to them gone. They have been reading my messages but not replying to them since. AITA? ",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-08-08,"AITA for asking my partner not to sleep with someome?

2,1emwc27,AITA For leaving a very messed up friendship?,"So, this is my first time here on this subreddit  
I (19 year old trans-female) had been in a friendship for about 6-7 years  
I had met 2 people back in 6th grade at school. I decided to be friends with them because they seemed like nice people and i had gotten to know them. Over the past 6-7 years these friends and pushed multiple boundaries i had set up, whenever I said something to them about it they would get mad and throw accusations at me for being an A\*\*hole or being Manipulative. Skip to July 6th of this year, I had tried to set a new boundary for something Traumatic that had happened and not even a few minutes after i had tried to set said boundary They immediately broke said boundary and began to talk about it. I had tried to step in the middle of it and they started to yell and scream at me about being manipulative again and i told them that if they kept this up that i would leave. It then spiraled into an really big argument and I had enough so I had told them that i couldn't keep dealing with it anymore and then left the friendship. It has been about a month since this happened and they keep texting my friends and accusing me of doing a bunch of really messed up stuff.

3,1emrjr6,AITA for asking to visit my brother during vacation with in-laws,"My (40m) wife’s family decided to book a trip to a vacation town (flights worth distance) for a long weekend (5 days). My brother happens to live 3.5 hours away so my wife and I thought we could take a day trip to go see him since we’ll be in the area and we don’t see him much, maybe 2-3 a year. Maybe meet halfway for a day or just do dinner.

We live close to my wife’s family and see them frequently. This would be the first trip we’ve taken together. 

My wife mentioned this to my MIL last month and MIL got upset, stating that this is “our families vacation”. Not loving the idea that we would take time to visit him.
