0,1enpppl,AITA for avoiding my godmother because of her daughter?,"(TERF = Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist)

My godmother and her family have been friends with my family for years. My dad met my godfather before he met my mom, and I cannot think of a memory where they haven’t been present in my life. My mom isn’t a big fan of the family, but I really liked them, they are eccentric and kind of weird, which is something I found really refreshing and comforting. I (27 NB) was especially close with my godsister (32 F) who I formed a somewhat of a cousin-like bond with. She loves reading and is an excellent writer, and has even published her own book. I really enjoyed her company and saw her as someone I could look up to. Until now.

Sometime in late 2022, I was scrolling through tumblr  and I came across something troubling on my dash. It was a post that had heavy undertones of transphobia. I was shocked and confused, as I know I didn’t follow anyone who had that kind of ideology. When I looked at who reblogged the post, I was even more shocked to find out that it was from my godsister. Confused and worried, I went through her tumblr, and since she tags everything I was able to find more of these posts. Somehow, I had never seen any of these posts of my dash, but here they were, ranging from posts that were aggressively transphobic, discrediting nonbinary as a gender identity, and the icing on the cake, praising JK Rowling like she were the next messiah. I can’t properly express the horror, anger and sadness I felt when I saw these posts on her blog. This was someone I trusted for YEARS, someone I confided in and someone I even looked up to. I am nonbinary, and many it not most of my friends are trans and genderqueer. I even told her this before I found out about her posts, and she didn’t even react to this news.

Because of this, I decided to cut off all contact with her—I don’t waste my time with TERFs. However, because of this decision, I have since been avoiding going to any parties or social gatherings my godmother has hosted at her home, because without a doubt my godsister would be there. My family things that I am overblowing this out of proportion, but I’ve tried to explain that)her ideology is extremely harmful and dangerous and as someone who is nonbinary, I feel extremely uncomfortable being around her. However, my folks are old school and don’t understand (and don’t really care) about my concerns, and even my brother  told me that I should just suck it up and stop avoiding my godsister. I don’t want to keep avoiding my godmother, as she has been an incredible help to me and my family for years, but putting myself in a situation where thing could not only get awkward but confrontational is really upsetting to me.

1,1eoeupa,AITA For Not Letting My Wife Have Some Of My Earnings From A Business Of Which She Wanted No Part?,"My wife and I had discussed my starting a business for a few years. I was under the impression we would be partners in the business. When the time came, I needed my wife's signatures on a few pieces of paperwork. She was adamant she wanted absolutely nothing to do with the business. In fact, those were her literal words: ""I want nothing to do with this business. It is entirely your project"" and she was quite angry about it. So, I took on other partners.

Well, the business has since become profitable and she has recently been making plans for the use of the money I make from the business as if it were her own. I told her (paraphrasing) ""This money is my money. It is not yours. It is in a separate account with only my name on it.

My wife also found out I altered my will to leave my share of the business and the money in the aforementioned account to my business partners and not her.

2,1eoesin,AITA for yelling at my parents for not getting my sister a birthday gift,"I am F25 and my sister is F27. I want to preface this by saying I’m so grateful of everything my parents have given us and provided us with. 

A few months ago, my sister wanted some concert tickets for her birthday so I bought them and we went and had a good time. She was very clear on the fact that this was her birthday gift and that it would take place of a physical gift. 

 Flash forward to this past weekend when my parents took me, my sister, her fiancé and my boyfriend all out to a birthday dinner. It was a very nice place and we all had a good time. Typically at dinner for birthdays, we bring in the gifts that we got the birthday person and open it up in the restaurant. There was no gift given from my parents, my gift was the concert tickets, and her fiancé and her were going to be doing gifts on her actual birthday (since it fell on a weekday). My sister made a comment of “where’s my gift?” And laughed. My mom replied by giving a snarky laugh back and saying “this is it (referring to the dinner)” my sister just said “yeah yeah” and moved on. Since my mom in the past has joked about not getting us any gifts and then we end up getting gifts and she was just messing with us.

When we all got back to my parents house to hang out, I could tell she was a little off. Then, as time went past, there were still no gifts and we were all about to leave my parents house for the night. My sister said something like “so you weren’t kidding? The dinner was the gift” my mom laughed and said “well yeah, the bill was about $150” 

I understand the argument of “well there’s starving kids in Africa” or “some people’s parents can’t even afford a nice dinner for their family” but that’s not how we have typically done things in the  past. Like I said, usually we get the dinner and our gifts. 

I immediately came to my sisters defense and told them it was kind of rude and explained the point that it’s just nice to get an actual physical gift on your birthday and it is kind of disappointing when there are no physical gifts. 

My mom then started yelling back and throwing the fact that they paid for us to get through college. And that we should be more grateful. But I am at the opinion that if you voluntarily choose to do something like that for your kids, it shouldn’t be thrown back in their face as a manipulation tactic. 

We then left and the family tension was a little high.

So AITA for yelling at my mom for not getting my sister a physical gift or are we entitled brats for expecting something more than an expensive dinner on our birthday? 

TL;DR my parents only got my sister a birthday dinner and failed to get her an actual physical gift. I yelled at them to come to my sisters defense.

Edit: because I’ve mentioned this in comments but not up here. Me and my sister take my parents out to dinner and get them a gift. My grandparents get my parents a physical gift still. It’s the family dynamics. I’m obviously going to pay for my parents dinner when it’s their birthday. And on top of that I like surprising them with something fun for them to unwrap. When you only think about my sisters dinner, it cost $20 and was a 5 cheese ziti. I get that for some families this would be great and overall i should be grateful. But in the perspective of the family norms it was kind of out of character of my parents. 

Update: so it’s been a wild morning. It’s now been a week since the bday dinner. My family thought it would be a good idea to get together this morning and talk it out. And it did not go how I expected. My sister started off by bringing up some things from the past that even I had forgot about and didn’t mention in my original post. She started off by bringing up her 16th birthday. For context, when my sister turned 16, she received a pair of gloves with chapsticks in each finger of the gloves. Keep in mind, her birthday is in the summer. She brought up how for MY 16th birthday, I got a jewelry holder with a giftcard in each pocket to my favorite stores and all she got were gloves that weren’t in season and some chapstick. She then brought up the fact that for my mom’s birthday in January, she made a group chat with a bunch of family members and sent her Amazon wishlist of all the things she wanted to get. My sister said this seemed hypocritical to send this list and expect those items but then not consider getting her a gift on her birthday. Lastly, she brought up how for MY birthday this year, I got a pair of Nikes and converse that I wanted AND a birthday dinner. Not gunna lie I kind of clocked that they seem to not be as extra for her birthdays as they are with other birthdays in the family which is why I kind of felt the need to stick up for her. I did however apologize for raising my voice and said I could have handled that better. My sister wanted to make it clear that it’s not that she was ungrateful for everything they’ve done for us, but just felt weird that it was a last minute “hey let’s get together on this day for dinner and invite your men” whereas for other birthdays it seems like they preplan everything and talk about the birthday a month in advance. In the end, my mom pulled the “well I guess I’m just such a terrible mom” card. But my dad texted my sister separately to tell her she understood her point and asked her what she wanted for a gift that he could get her. 

Thanks for all your input on the situation and I hear all of you when you say that a lot of families don’t get together for birthdays or even have money to get their kids things. I also hear you with the comments of our ages and how at a certain age, we should stop expecting gifts. However I think it was just a surprising event to us because our family has always been on the same page of “you’re never too old for a birthday gift.” For Christmas, my parents would always get my cousins gifts and my aunt and uncle would always get me and my sister gifts but my aunt and mom talked and came to a mutual agreement that once we passed 18, they would stop doing gifts for each others kids at Christmas. I think the fact that my mom and aunt communicated about that kind of stuff made me think my mom would do the same thing for birthdays if they ever decided we were too old for a birthday gift. So I think it was more about the principle than the actual gift.  ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-09,"AITA for yelling at my parents for not getting my sister a birthday gift I am F25 and my sister is F27.

My husband’s coworker and his wife showed up to the scrimmage to support AJ and now I feel selfish and like a jerk for not going. AJ and I had talked about my going earlier in the day, and when I said I probably wasn’t going he was bummed. He said it was fine, but I could tell he wasn’t happy. 

Now his coworker’s wife is asking me why I’m not there supporting my husband. **she’s not being rude about it, just surprised I’m not there** Should I have sucked it up and just went anyway?",0.0,0.07597438991069794,0,1
7,1eoeahu,AITA for wearing a two piece to my kids’ swimming lessons?,"I (27f) am a mother to quadruplets aged 2. This is their first year taking swimming lessons, and, at their age, the lessons require one-one-one with the child/adult as well as an instructor to teach. So me, my husband, and two of my husbands friends came along. (Unfortunately all four of the kids got booked for the same time). They started the lessons on Monday and ended today (Friday). 

At the lessons, all the other kids had their mothers/female guardians with them, and all of them wore shorts/shirt swimsuits. My husband/his friends had trunks with no shirt, and I wore a two piece. Nothing bad, everything was well covered, but obviously my stomach and back showed. I didn’t think it was a big deal, and I honestly didn’t even notice what everyone wore until probably Wednesday. And it was fine because everybody (including me) was modest. 

However, they finished their lessons today. When everyone was getting changed to leave, a few mothers came up to me. They said they didn’t want to mention it earlier to make classes awkward, but they and a few other mothers were uncomfortable with how I was wearing a two piece to the lessons all week. The suggested if I do another class with my kids here, I cover up my stomach because nobody wants to see it Because of the stretch marks from my pregnancy. (Which is a lot more than average because I had quadruplets). I asked if they had an issue with how my husband/his friends didn’t wear a shirt at all, and they said the didn’t care because they didn’t have the “baby belly” like I did. 

Now I’m back home, and I can’t decide if they were being rude or just were honest. They made sure to tell me it wasn’t about the modesty, it was just my stomach. I never thought about it, so maybe it’s my fault for being careless and not thinking of everyone else. My husband says I was fine, but all the mothers there apparently don’t think so. AITA?

Edit: I did not expect this to blow up so much! I’m so thankful to all the kind comments, I’ve spent 20 minutes reading and upvoting there’s just so many Lol. This has made me feel much better about the situation. Fortunately (or unfortunately) this isn’t our usual pool and we’re done lessons until next year so I won’t have the chance to say anything you suggested to those people 😂.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-09,"AITA for wearing a two piece to my kids’ swimming lessons?

8,1eoe97b,AITA for wanting my bf to get a job instead of building his dream business?,"My bf (42M) and I (39F) moved in together 5 months ago.  We made a verbal agreement about how much each of us would contribute towards the household bills, based on our individual incomes.  It was close to 50/50, with me paying a bit less.

Everything was fine the first two months.  Then bf lost his WFH job when the company shut down.  He looked for other WFH gigs but told me they were difficult to find for the amount of money he wants to make.  This went on for about two months, and he started occasionally door-dashing for a little income.  In the meantime, I got a job making more money, but the rent was still half my salary.   Month three, I finally snapped.  I told my BF I didn't sign up for this and I'm tired of being stressed and anxious about the bills - and also being the only one worried about paying them. I had to cash out my 401k to keep up with the bills and fix my car when it died (that was $1500 alone).

He proceeded to tell me that he doesn't want to work for a company making little money when he can start his own company and make a lot more.  He created a website, hired a virtual assistant, and started going to events to draw interest.  I'm assuming he uses the door dash income to cover all that.  He uses my car to get around since he doesn't have one.  He gave me $250 that month.  He posts a lot about his business on social media which is fine, but I believe it also gives everyone the impression that he/we are doing GREAT when in reality, he has almost no income and I'm stressed to the max.

We are now in month four and I have used up every cash reserve I had; my credit cards are close to being maxed out.  I told him that I cannot pay the rent by myself again next month, it's just not possible.  He told me I need to sacrifice and save every penny.  He thinks the bones I buy for our dogs and the bird seed I put out for wild birds are luxuries that I am wasting money on (just two examples).  He even told me a story about someone who fed their kids ramen and crackers for 10 years until they became a doctor and made a ton of money.  He thinks if I don't buy these things that I SHOULD be able to pay all the bills on my own.  I feel completely screwed.  I got a job making more money and feel I should be able to spend a little on things that make me happy -- especially because I pay for everything in the house.  He said six months from now he'll be making so much money that none of this will matter... I can only focus on this month, next month and all the bills that keep coming.  We are on completely opposite pages.

AITA for expecting him to contribute to the household bills now instead of working towards his dream?

10,1eoe2f8,AITA and causing arguments?,"Posting as I am genuinely at my wits end and beginning not sure if I am going crazy.

Me and my girlfriend have been together for around 5years, first meeting at university and we have lived together for the majority of this. In our current situation, we are living in a flat owned by her parents, with me paying rent and her instead putting money into savings each month instead.

The reason I bring this up first is that it is a situation that unfortunately rears it’s ugly head frequently, though only when we argue. We’ve been arguing a lot recently and it always stems from something minor before blowing up (someone not contributing to house work, not spending enough time together etc). 

Now I’m well aware that I’m not perfect, but one thing I do pride myself on is that I will always listen and try to understand the other side. Today, I feel like I have been pushed over my tipping point as midway through me & my partner trying to resolve an argument, she claims she didn’t say something I vividly remember she did - this is not the first time this has happened, which is making me feel crazy. 

As a result, I began a recording on the voice notes app on my phone. This wasn’t hidden or anything, I put my phone on the table between us and explained it was so we could actually get to the bottom of it & nothing could be missed or miss-quoted (effectively I am beginning to feel like I am being/have been gaslit but not sure, I didn’t say this aloud to prevent any further tension). At this point she blew up and began saying she wouldn’t speak to me until it was turned off. 

Following this she went and turned the oven off so I couldn’t eat and when I asked why she replied with ‘it’s my oven’. My response to this was that it is just as mine as it is hers as I have a rental agreement also, and that I don’t appreciate her circling back to her common argument of ‘it’s my oven/flat/bed’ etc at which point she walked to the bedroom calling me crazy as she did so. I’m now waiting for the oven to reheat so I can eat & am being made to sleep in the home office.

11,1eodl2g,AITA for selling someone a “filthy” board game?,"This is a trivial one, but I still wonder if I might be an AH for this. 

We’re moving, so I’m getting rid of a bunch of boardgames that we never play anymore. 

Nevertheless, they would be a shame to just throw away, so I’ve put a bunch of them out on a second hand market place in the hopes that someone could give them a new home. 

The board game in question is “What do you Meme”, which was quite popular in 2018ish, even in Europe. And as the cover say, it’s an adult party game. The game is of course spotless (and barely used), but contains some NSFW jokes (but no “filthy” pics). In addition to the (unused) extension pack, it was worth about at least $ 50 back when I bought it. 

Instead of asking for money, I said I would be willing to exchange it for a bag of a particular brand of chocolate. This cost barely $ 4 (I compared the currency in my home country). I would say I’m practically giving it away for free. 

I was instantly contacted by a guy that said he would try to get the chocolates for our trade (they sell it at literally every grocery store in my country). 

Later in the evening he sent another message saying: “I just looked closer at the picture, which says ‘Adult Party Game’. Does that mean it’s filthy? Because then I don’t want it. Although the game could also be interesting”. 

I told him to Google what the game actually is (it was late and I didn’t want to explain what a meme is), but gave a short answer that although it’s not about being filthy (his words), it’s not a game for children. 

We agreed to meet the next day. And the guy a met turned out to be a 16-7 year old awkward kid who seemed very shy. He brought the chocolate though, and I shook his hand and said it was nice meeting him.  I gave him a polite smile and said I was happy to give the game a new home to someone who can appreciate it. He didn’t really answer that other than saying “that was an interesting ad”.  Since he didn’t seem like wanting to talk, I wished him a happy weekend and thanking him for the chocolate, we parted ways. 

Not ten minutes later I get a new message:

“Oh I just opened now and it has filthy/$exual topics, I want to trade back again.” 
(Trying to translate from my language without loosing important content or sentiment)

As I said I’m in the middle of moving and frankly, the whole meeting felt awkward. 
I just want to finish packing up my boxes and enjoy some chocolate for my Friday night. 

So I ignored his message. There is no return policy on these second hand markets unless the product is faulty, and honestly the game isn’t filthy. Any millennial that have played either “What do you meme” or “Cards against humanity” know that the game is as filthy as you make it. And since he even have the extension pack, he can just pick away any cards he think is too NSFW for him.

12,1eodjv2,"AITA for letting my daughter wear whatever she is comfortable in, in my house?","Okay, this requires some important details. First, I am a (37M). My ex wife, ""Deanna"" (36F) and I have 2 kids, our daughter ""Jane"" (12F) and our son ""Eddie"" (10M). We got married semi young at 23 and 24, we divorced amicably five years ago. 

Deanna recently married a man she has been seeing for a few years, who I will call ""A."" Something I need to bring up here is that I am half Mexican, Deanna is a white woman, and A is of Middle Eastern descent. While I wouldn't say A and I are friends, I do think he's a pretty nice guy, and seems like a really good match for Deanna. The kids also like him, so that's another bonus in my book.

Deanna and I split custody of the kids. HOWEVER.  Deanna and A got married two months ago. Since then, Deanna has chosen to wear a covering, which I am sorry but the name slips my mind. She converted to A's religion as well. Which, I'm very happy about if that's what she wants. But last week, when she dropped off the kids, I was surprised to see that Jane was wearing one as well. But, I assumed she must have wanted to wear it and was maybe deciding to convert her faith as well, so I didn't bring it up. I feel that she's old enough to decide for herself, and as an atheist myself, I'm all for my children choosing what they believe

A few days ago, I was going to go see a movie with my kids but told them I had to finish some paperwork in my office first, which took about half an hour. When I walked back into the living room, Jane was wearing one of Eddie's t shirts and a pair of shorts. We had a conversation which kind of went like this:


Me: what's going on? Jane, are you supposed to take off your covering? (I don't really know how any of it works, sorry if that offends anyone)

Eddie: she hates wearing that  stuff. So I let her borrow some of my clothes.

Jane: yeah dad, I hate it. Mom makes me wear it. She says I have to wear it all the time, even at your house.

Me: so, you aren't choosing to wear it?

Jane: no. I never want to wear it again.


I checked her bag, and sure enough, it contained tank tops underwear, and the coverings (which cover the hair and body, but not the face.) I took the kids on a quick target trip before the movie to get Jane some clothes of her liking. Two days ago, when Deanna came by to pick up the kids, she flipped out on Jane for not wearing the traditional clothing. Deanna and I got into a heated argument, and I told her that Jane shouldn't HAVE TO wear the covering if she doesn't want to, especially because it's very hot in our city. Deanna argued that she and the kids are now different amd follow a stricter religion,
  I might be the a-hole because I argued back that it is stupid that the religion would force young girls to cover up so much all the time and  be so strict about it. Deanna took offense, and left with the kids. I feel bad because I don't want to insult a while country or countries but I don't think my daughter should have to wear anything she doesn't want to.

13,1eocxoq,AITA for disengaging with my friend after she was upset I can't make her wedding due to a family emergency,"I'm (30F) meant to be a bridesmaid for my friend (33F) next week, but a very close family member has fallen seriously ill so I'm having to immediately go to support them and my other family members.

Edited for clarity; my elderly father had a stroke and I need to support my elderly mother. I do not have other family that can offer support. 

I'm very aware wedding planning is stressful, and this wedding has been no exception, although it's now been organised as a much smaller event (I was meant to be one of only a few attendees). I let her know as soon as I could that whilst I would try my hardest to be there for her on the day, as I know her wedding means a lot to her and I have been very involved in planning/organising and am meant to play a significant role, I just couldn't commit at this stage given the serious nature of what my family are going through. I called her as soon as I could to let her know as gently as possible, and to assure her I would do everything I could to make it but just had to let her know that there is a chance I can't make it because my family member is currently in hospital and I wanted to give her time to have a back up plan, and she just hung up the phone. 

Today she messaged me. She hasn't asked if I'm ok and she's effectively uninvited me from the wedding as she says she can't deal with the uncertainty.

",Not the A-hole,2024-08-09,"AITA for disengaging with my friend after she was upset I can't make her wedding due to a family emergency I'm (30F) meant to be a bridesmaid for my friend (33F) next week, but a very close family member has fallen seriously ill so I'm having to immediately go to support them and my other family members.

Edited for clarity; my elderly father had a stroke and I need to support my elderly mother. I do not have other family that can offer support. 

I'm very aware wedding planning is stressful, and this wedding has been no exception, although it's now been organised as a much smaller event (I was meant to be one of only a few attendees). I let her know as soon as I could that whilst I would try my hardest to be there for her on the day, as I know her wedding means a lot to her and I have been very involved in planning/organising and am meant to play a significant role, I just couldn't commit at this stage given the serious nature of what my family are going through. I called her as soon as I could to let her know as gently as possible, and to assure her I would do everything I could to make it but just had to let her know that there is a chance I can't make it because my family member is currently in hospital and I wanted to give her time to have a back up plan, and she just hung up the phone. 

Today she messaged me. She hasn't asked if I'm ok and she's effectively uninvited me from the wedding as she says she can't deal with the uncertainty. She used the opportunity to tell me that it was my fault that she reacted as she did and went on to say we needed space from each other.

16,1eocq8l,AITA for buying locks and a mini fridge in my room?,"I (16f) am the oldest in my family. I have 8 younger siblings age 12, 10, 9, 9, 6, 4, 4, and 2. privacy is very hard to come by around here. Luckily, I only share a room with one person (12f), but I might as well share with everyone because my siblings come barging in every five minutes and snoop through my things, especially when I’m not home. 

I have some very expensive makeup and hair products that I keep stashed in my drawer. Last week, the 4yo twins came in and smashed or emptied half the items. I have special editions of books, and 10f came in and rumpled some pages a few days ago. And my friend made me some traditional food from her culture, which I put in the fridge (LABELED) up high, and somehow my siblings ignored it and ate it yesterday. Things like this happen all the time, and the only one who doesn’t do this kind of thing is 12. 

I’ve spoken to my parents about things like this, but they always say it’s part of having siblings and I need to put my things away better or learn to share, since they’re only little. The thing is, I do put my things away, and they still go through my entire room to find them. So I gave up and I bought a door lock and Childs locks for my drawers, as well as a mini fridge (I am going to share the fridge with 12 because I know she won’t eat the food I put in there). I put the lock on the door and locked my drawers and bookcases yesterday. 

My parents didn’t even notice, they apparently found out after a bunch of kids came crying to them about how ‘they can’t get in my room to use my cool things’. When I came home from work today, they confronted me about how I shouldn’t shut my siblings out. I told them if they knocked on the door and asked me to use my things, I would probably say yes. But since they don’t know how to do that and instead sneak in when I’m not home, I was going to keep the locks on to protect my stuff. 12 also told me she likes the door lock too. 

But my parents are angry because I never asked them, and again, I’m ‘shutting my siblings out’. They’re punishing me by not letting me leave the house except work/school for the next month, but they can’t take the locks off because I bought them with my own money.

17,1eoc958,WIBTA if I told my partner to get a job,"For some background, my partner moved in with me eight months ago after being laid off. This is something that I had no issue with, as we were already discussing moving in together. He lives off his savings, and we split everything 50/50. The problem isn't that I specifically hate that he is unemployed; I hate that he uses his time at home to do nothing. I work two jobs and will come home to him on his computer surfing social media, watching TV, or looking up topics he enjoys. I am glad that he can do this in his free time. However, he prioritizes his free time over the chores we divide, which cuts into my free time.

We currently have chores divided equally. But they aren't divided equally. I have sensory issues, and there are a few chores that I am physically unable to do without recoiling and getting chicken skin. These two chores are dishwashing and sink cleaning. He does the dishes because of this, but he doesn't exactly do the dishes. They are never done in a timely fashion. Food will sit rotting in the sink for days before they decide it is time to wash the dishes. I ask and remind them, but they continuously brush me off. I have begun taking up more and more of the chore workload, as he doesn't do them. 

Because of this, I will come home from a long day at work, shower, and get straight back into working in the household. I will be in the shower and notice it was last cleaned a week ago.

And later on it becomes important to say that I’m not really social and suck at conversations and social situations. So I’m really awkward and introverted and basically stick to a few good friends.

Basically my dad has an old college chat where all his old college classmates are in. (Like 100 ppl).

Here comes the part where I think he went wrong. He expected me to show Jason around and hang out with him. (We had never met before and I have no background info to rely on) However he expected me to become buddy buddy with him since all my siblings are over 18 years old when all I wanted to do here was just go to the beach and chill Tf out.

Another Thing is that Jason only has me to rely on since the other people he could talk to (my cousins) will probably stick to speaking Spanish which Jason doesn’t know. And I told him all this.

Honestly, he’s had issues with addiction almost his whole life. For awhile in my 20s, I didn’t speak to him for 5 years because we got into a blow up. We both said hurtful things to and about each other. We both apologized. We moved on. Years go by and unfortunately, he hits some rough patches. I end up loaning him money for work stuff  (he claimed). 

Only, my sister in law informed me that he was actually using that money to get high. I had no idea. I was ignorant of the entire thing. In fact, she tells me that he had been using for quite some time. He even OD’ed in front my niece and nephew. My nephew had to give him Narcan. 

I jump into “how can I help him”. I get him to a sober living home. Pay a lot of money for it. Buy him groceries. Buy him sheets. Give him resources for detox programs and rehabs. 

He says he go do it on his own. Then says he doesn’t need it. My mom told me to not give him anymore money. My other brother also gave him a lot of money. He had no idea that our eldest brother was also asking me, my aunt, his friends, my sister in law, our cousins, etc for money too. 

He would say “give me to buy water”. Water doesn’t cost $40. He left the sober place. Saying it was bs. I end up helping to pay for him to stay in a hotel after finding out he was on the streets. My sister in law couldn’t take him in anymore because she has to put her children over him. I respect her so much for that. 


But he only starts calling and texting saying everyone  abandoned him. His life sucks. He’s gonna go steal. He manipulates and uses your emotions to get what he wants so he can get high. Always lying. Using his children to garner sympathy. 

I showed my mom all this. Showed her his texts. Showed her how much money I lent him. How much money our other brother lent him. I explained to her that I would not open up communication to him anymore. Not until he gets help. 

Recently, she told me the doctor’s found cancer in him. He went in for surgery.  But they found it spread. She wants me to go see him. “Says he’s all alone” “no one is with him” 

She is also manipulating people’s emotions and refuses to hear her other children. 

I don’t feel comfortable going to see him because I don’t believe he is clean. I don’t believe he has changed. He has not uttered a single apology. He only ever tried to text for money. Never to check up on us. 

Am I the AH for not going to see him? I honestly don’t know what I feel. I’m kind of numb. This is the same brother that would ask me (his sister) for urine to pass the drug tests for work. I made countless applications for him. He asked his teenaged son for it too!

23,1eobbc7,AITA for reporting my classmate? ,"Hi everyone,
I was taking summer school this summer for a science class that requires a lab. During the lab, most of my lab group was gone and it was just me and another girl. We worked on the lab together, with me typing up my lab write up while we were doing it. I’d like to mention here that this girl had the opportunity to work on her write up as well, but didn’t. She asked me to share my doc with her, but honestly throughout the summer session she has been super flaky, goes home early here and there because she doesn’t want to stay, and copies off others a lot. I told her she is welcome to take a photo of the data we both got together, and scrolled up on my document to hide my work so she wouldn’t copy it. She took a photo of the data section on the document and it seemed that was it. My professor said something to me, so I turned around, with my laptop on the lab table unlocked. When I turned around, I see this girl touching my computer without my permission, scrolling through it, and taking photos of work I did on my own. I looked at her, said “uhh?” And she looked back at me and said “what?”. I tried to let it go, but I felt like she really overstepped this time, so I reported her to my professor, who was also upset and agreed what she did was wrong. I reported her because I believe she knew what she did was wrong. She waited until I wasn’t looking to touch my computer and take photos of my work. She found out I reported her and I guess she said some stuff to my professor, but I honestly feel like what I did was right, as she shouldn’t have been touching my stuff without asking in the first place. My professor says he is giving her a zero on the lab if he sees that she steals my work. I don’t want that for her necessarily, unless she copies my work, but AITA? 
BTW: this girl is super spoiled and comes from a rich family and lives by the beach, so idk, maybe that’s why she’s a bit entitled. ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-09,"AITA for reporting my classmate?  Hi everyone,

——————————

For context, I(33F) am the primary breadwinner in our house. My husband(35F) freelances but doesn’t earn enough to cover basic expenses, so I cover all our rent, utilities, groceries, etc. 

Last year for our anniversary, we treated ourselves to some vintage prints to hang around the apartment. It was exciting at the time because we hadn’t bought art together before, and we want to eventually have nice conversation starters when entertaining guests. I purchased the prints myself as a gift to us both. 

Unfortunately, I hadn’t researched the cost for getting artwork custom framed. When we started looking into frames, I realized we’d need to save up some cash before jumping into it. We decided to put it off for awhile. 

It’s been almost a year since then. I almost forgot about the prints rolled away in our closet as I’ve been too focused on a stressful year at work. We’ve made other expensive purchases since then to improve our place together, all covered by me. A new couch, a new entertainment console, new speakers, etc. This is all while I’m trying to pay down my student loans. 

Today I let my husband know I was going to go out to get a frame for a small print I purchased from a friend. I was planning to just get a premade frame from a hobby store. He scoffed, insulted my plans and walked away in a huff. I confronted him about his attitude. 

He then went into a rant about how I haven’t made time to frame our anniversary prints, but I have time to get a poor quality frame for a new print. I didn’t realize he’s been holding this over me until today. I told him how expensive custom framing gets and that he should raise the money himself if he wants to get it done so much. He said I already agreed to getting the prints and it was on me for not prioritizing the framing. 

I’m constantly worrying about our finances, supporting us both, but I figured I could treat myself by getting a cheap frame for my friend’s artwork. This all feels so stupid, it’s such a first world problem. I’m frustrated that he has an attitude about the whole thing when *he* doesn’t help more with our income. 

AITA in this situation? Are we both assholes here? I’m gonna go ahead and try to get our anniversary prints framed as soon as I can, but I feel hurt that he’d insult me for wanting to get a cheap frame for something that was just for me.

30,1eo9y3s,AITAH for telling my mother that my sister is incompetent because of her?," A bit of basic information before I tell the ""story"".

I'm 18 in higher education, and 3 years older than my sister. My mother is currently not working due to a medical condition, but my father works enough that we pay the bills without breaking his back, though he does work abroad (important)

Due to my mother's condition, I help with almost every chore and household duty including cooking and so on and so forth. I typically don't mind this, because she is my mother who raised us with love and care, sacrificing a lot for our sake. 

I won't pretend we don't get frustrated with each other every now and then, but my family is very close so arguments end in hugs most of the time.

As of late, especially now that it's summer, we have all come to realise that my sister has been particularly malicious to everyone in the house, and very lazy. She does nothing unless she's absolutely forced to (including showering), and even then she insists on taking breaks in the middle of mundane tasks.

She is barely capable of heating up leftovers, let alone making a simple meal for herself beyond a sandwich. She will cuss out and and give a cold shoulder to anyone and everyone including our very wholesome grandparents who live in another country.

Her lack of basic survival skills recently came up in conversation when my mother said that my sister would die in a house full of food.

I agreed, but I told her that it was her fault my sister became this way. If she wanted, she *could* ask my sister to handle more household tasks instead of me and learn, and she *could* punish my sister for disrespecting anything that moves.

My mother is smart, and absolutely insists that with her physical capacity being limited at the moment, she *wants* and *enjoys* being the ""psychological"" support for the family, but being frank I told her that she is failing.

My sister can get away with anything, or doing nothing.

I'm obviously no saint. I also get lazy, refuse to do something, etc. and when I do that, I get chewed out (and rightfully so, I'm not contesting that), but when I was 15, even 13, I knew how to at the very least *survive* and stay clean on my own in case of an emergency.

My sister isn't stupid, either, she could be of help if she wanted to be, but she isn't and I end up carrying her burden.

My father's household burden I don't mind carrying. My mother's burden I don't mind carrying, but my sister's attitude is disgusting.

My mother told me I was an ass for thinking that way, and is saying that my sister's condition is beyond her.

32,1eo9h2q,AITA For Not Changing My Last Name,"AITA for refusing to change my name to my new husband's name?

I (35F) was previously married to my now ex-husband (36M), we'll call him Stan. Stan and I were married for 6 years until we divorced on good terms 5 years ago. We do not have any kids together and everything was split 50/50 as we had similar assets. We also still keep in contact and meet once a month for dinner or coffee.

When we got married, I took Stan's last name, as my maiden name was difficult for others to spell and pronounce. His, on the other hand, was simple, think ""Hall"" for example.

3 years ago I met my now fiancee (37M) who we'll call Todd. Todd also has a somewhat difficult last name to spell and pronounce. When I met him, I told him if we get married I am keeping my last name. He seemed to have no problem with this. We got engaged a year ago and have been planning the wedding since.

3 days ago, as we were talking about the wedding, he brought up changing my last name to his. I reminded him of what I said at the beginning of our relationship and that I wasn't comfortable changing my last name as I enjoy having a simple last name and that his would cause confusion. He got mad at me and told me I am being unreasonable. He says that I have no kids so it wouldn't be confusing for them and that it just ties me to my past with Stan and not to him.

We argued about it and he told both of our families and our mutual friends. My family understands why I don't want to change my name but also says it is disrespectful to him to not change. His family is on his side and our friends are torn.

AITA for not wanting to change my name?

  
EDIT:

I wanted to clear some things up about me and my ex-husband Stan as well as when I told Todd I wasn't changing my name.

Stan and I were friends from childhood who didn't start dating until college. Our families are still close and we divorced due to being better friends than romantic partners. We go out once a month and sometimes even skip months. Todd was aware of this when we started dating and is even friends with Stan. Stan comes to holidays as well and there is no bad blood between the two of them.

I told Todd when we started dating, not the day we first met. We both had plans to ""date to marry"", so I felt it was important to tell him this soon into the relationship once we established we wanted a future. He accepted my reasoning at the time.

34,1eo9bth,WIBTA if I inform my husband's friends about my husbands gambling addictions?,"My (38 F) husband (35 M) have been married for 1.5 yrs. When we met he had informed me that he likes to gamble once in a while and I was okay with that as long as he kept a leash on his spending. Things changed post our marriage. Since it was my second marriage I was not too keen on having an expensive wedding; but my husband wanted to go all out because it was his first. Well I gave in and we had a 250+ guests destination wedding. This left a severe hole in our pocket and I was still confident that we will make it through.

I did not know that my husband had resorted to Gambling to make fast money. He made me take huge loans in the name of how he needs help in his business or how he has to pay someone whom he owes in business etc.

I started feeling something is fishy when no amount of loan that I took ever solved his financial problems; because the money I had taken from banks was so much that I could have easily bought an apartment with it.

Well I started to check his phone and that is when I got to know that he has a huge debt because of his gambling which had now turned into an addiction.

I confronted him and he initially accepted but soon started being defensive about where the money was being used. I put my foot down and told him to stop the Gambling and we can together figure out how to pay back the debts. I urged him to not add onto those debts. He promised me that he would stop the gambling.

Off lately he had started being cagey about his phone and would not let me even lay a finger on it. Which again rose my suspicions. I checked his phone when he was asleep and found that he has taken large amounts from his friends and have given them unachievable deadlines with regards to the repayment.

I cannot help the friends he has already taken money from; but I feel I should reach out to the others and request them not to loan him any money because he is just losing chunks and chunks of it in gambling.

I can see my husband slipping into sadness over losing the money but he just is unable to stop in hopes that he might win big one day and all the problems would be solved. Our marriage is suffering heavily because of this, as I am barely able to meet out monthly expenses and it has left me in a constant anxiety. We barely speak to each other without starting a fight and in these times it is his friends that keep his spirits high.

His own family is being very difficult about the money issue and so their support is something I cannot count on.

I feel if I speak with his friends; they will distance from him and I do not want to risk isolating him in a time that he is under immense pressure. As much as I love him and do not want to see him suffering; I also do not want his friends to lose their hard earned money.

I was coming back from a drive with my mother and she asked me beforehand if I can park the car. I confidently said yes, but unfortunately I didn't pay much attention and that's how my foolishness got the better of me.

38,1eo95qc,AITA-i didn't share the zoom link to my virtual wedding with who would have been my MOH.,"This happened a few years ago and I've recently been curious of what others may think. 

My now husband and I had planned on having a small wedding. We checked out a few small venues and had also considered having it in our backyard but the cost to get it presentable and rent chairs etc was going to be as much as a small venue. 

I talked to who I thought would be my brides maids and maid of honor. The maid of honor was to be a colleague who I grew close to over the years. She often had some drama going on either in her personal life or work and we'd often vent or problem solve together. 

Ultimately, we decided on a virtual wedding in our living room with only our immediate family present. We had breakfast in the morning and the ceremony was with the courthouse on our TV. 

Leading up to the wedding date, I was 6ish months into a promoted position and very stressed with work. We had my Bachelorette weekend getaway and then my fiance and I had a week long pre honey moon.  

Side note, I've always been technically challenged and do not do well with being the center of attention.  

Two days before the big day my husband and I returned from the pre moon. The day before the wedding day, my soon to be sister in law offered to do a zoom invitation/link to be able to share with family/friends and offered to record for us. 

This was sent out to immediate family who couldn't attend as they live out of the area who shared with other family/friends. 

Ultimately, where i may be TA is that I did not share the zoom link with the MOH. I had a lot going on at the time and didn't plan for the zoom to begin with.  I knew she'd be working but also she could step away to watch if needed but ultimately, outside of sharing with my family, I didnt think of it. 

The MOH reached out after the big date (she knew when this was going down and the plan for breakfast). She ongratulated me and that was it. She then wasn't answering my calls or talking with me/responding to my texts. 

Later on, we had a work thing where we were meeting up for a working dinner. I had bought a necklace as a thank you gift (for the Bachelorette party) to give to the MOH. This is where I learned how hurt she was that I didn't send her the link to the wedding. She stated that if we were really as good of friends as we thought, I would have invited the person who was to be my MOH. I apologized and tried to explain it wasn't intentional but she wouldn't have it. She would not accept my gift either. 

I ended up leaving the gift in her purse before leaving. I later texted her an apology and that it truthfully wasn't intential and I didn't realize it'd mean so much but I also thought cutting me off for this was a bit much. She disagreed and said I was TA and didn't seem truly apologetic.  

So here I am a few years later with some time on my hands and wondering if I was the one in the wrong. I miss having my friend to talk to.

Ultimately, where i may be TA is that I did not share the zoom link with the MOH. I had a lot going on at the time and didn't plan for the zoom to begin with.  I knew she'd be working but also she could step away to watch if needed but ultimately, outside of sharing with my family, I didnt think of it. 

The MOH reached out after the big date (she knew when this was going down and the plan for breakfast). She ongratulated me and that was it. She then wasn't answering my calls or talking with me/responding to my texts. 

Later on, we had a work thing where we were meeting up for a working dinner. I had bought a necklace as a thank you gift (for the Bachelorette party) to give to the MOH. This is where I learned how hurt she was that I didn't send her the link to the wedding. She stated that if we were really as good of friends as we thought, I would have invited the person who was to be my MOH. I apologized and tried to explain it wasn't intentional but she wouldn't have it. She would not accept my gift either. 

I ended up leaving the gift in her purse before leaving. I later texted her an apology and that it truthfully wasn't intential and I didn't realize it'd mean so much but I also thought cutting me off for this was a bit much. She disagreed and said I was TA and didn't seem truly apologetic.  

So here I am a few years later with some time on my hands and wondering if I was the one in the wrong. I miss having my friend to talk to. ",1.0,1.0415631532669067,1,1
39,1eo8ydm,AITA for switching mortgage lenders at the last minute?,"My wife and I are in the process of buying a home and decided to use our realtors brother as a mortgage lender. He initially had us at 7% - we just went under contract this week and just as we did interest rates dropped. I called our lender and asked if we could get a better rate and he told us he could do 6.75 so I shopped around and found someone else who put us at 5.75. After I told the previous lender he came back with 5.75 but his costs at closing were still higher. Here is the breakup email… (and his response). 

“After sitting on a few different options for a bit we ended up deciding to go with a different lender. There were a couple of factors that went into our decision;

1. The company we chose doesn't sell their mortgage loans, which we think will benefit us in the long run when we decide to refinance.
2. After running the numbers this loan was still cheaper after factoring in the escrow and fees that were initially left out.

We really do appreciate your help and persistence.
This is nothing personal - it is just what's best for us and our finances right now. Happy to leave a good review or take any surveys you want to send our way.

Thanks again.”

Here is his response…

“On the contrary I am deeply disappointed in how this played out. I have been helping you for months now and have advised, coached and been available for you this whole time. To not even have the decency to call me to have a conversation over these past four days while you've been under contract is really disappointing to me.

Two things, the servicer of your mortgage has no bearing on your refinance opportunities, anything else being communicated is a lie. Also when a bank sends numbers out of the gate and they are wrong and another lender has to tell you they are wrong for them to fix them, how would you know they are accurate now. If I didn't tell you originally, you would've never known

You may find this unprofessional but this is personal for me because this is how I make my money, I put my time, energy and knowledge into these deals to help my clients and for you to send me an email and not even have the decency to have a phone call with me to have the conversation. Not even giving me the opportunity to compete for the business is even more unprofessional. I hope you got what you wanted from this and good luck.”

To be fair he was oftentimes hard to get a hold of. The new lender emails me every day with market updates and is overall a better communicator. 

I kind of feel like an asshole because we have been “working” with him for a few months but this is also a huge purchase and I need to do what’s right for us. I didn’t want to call him because I didn’t want the back and forth negotiations - I work in sales so I know how that goes. He should have given me the 5.75 when I asked.

There has been some strain however with her going through my phone and seeing i’ve been with a girl.. for context i am mid 20s F and i bought my own house but yes she still pays my phone bill and yes she is religious. This all started because my sister who i have no contact with for the past 5 years is leaving the country (that’s a whole other aita situation) and my mom asked if i wanted to go to her goodbye dinner/wedding i guess and i said no i dont see the reason to go because we have zero relationship and i offered to go to therapy with my sister and she didn’t bite therefore there’s nothing i can do for our ‘relationship’. Now we had a little back and forth about the situation and she didn’t message again after my other sister jumped in and told her to stop because she crossed the line with a certain comment

well my mom was leaving for the week and had no one to watch her dog .. she was too prideful to ask me but i knew her situation so none the less i took the dog because she’s only five months and i wanted to give the sweet pup the best week ever 

now my mom has been back for two days and i could easily go and drop the dog off but again she too prideful to text and ask me to bring her dog but can call other family members to ask things from me 
so
i am  not bringing her dog until she texts/talks and gives me an apology. 
there’s a lot more to the whole story but this is enough for just this situation i suppose so 
my standing is blood and family does not mean you get to treat eachother like shit and we are obligated to say it’s okay and move on 
so am i the asshole for keep her dog with me because if she can be petty so can i!

41,1eo8svg,WIBTA for excluding my niece in a birthday celebration?,"My son and niece are the same age and were born within two weeks of one another. When we planned my son's first birthday party, my brother insisted that we make it a double birthday celebration for both kids because it would be more convenient. His actual biggest reason was that he didn't want to plan a separate party for his daughter because it was ""too stressful and complicated"", and ""you're already throwing \[son\] a party, and you might as well include \[niece\] in it too"". My brother also said that if we didn't include niece in the celebration, then I would be a terrible aunt for making her miss out on her first birthday party, which ultimately meant that he and my SIL weren't going to throw her one separately. Ultimately, my husband and I agreed because we wanted both kids to be celebrated. I didn't want my niece to look back at old photos and videos and wonder why our son always got a party and she didn't.

Now, my husband and I are discussing our son's third birthday. We like to plan a few months in advance to book the place, figure out catering, and so on. We mentioned a few dates to our families, and my brother immediately said that he'd get back to us on dates that my SIL's family would be free so that we could also celebrate niece's birthday. I told him that we were only celebrating son's birthday because we are the ones doing the planning, spending the money, and taking care of invites, decorations, etc. . My brother once again brought up that I might as well include niece as a birthday celebrant because her birthday is right after son's, and I would be cruel to just exclude her. He and SIL still won't throw her her own party.

I honestly don't like being guilted into doing something for my niece because of my brother's laziness and lack of motivation to party plan. It's toxic and annoying, and as much as I do love my niece, it's not up to me to ensure that her birthday is always celebrated, right? But our parents are torn because they say I should just do it and be the aunt who is supportive and who gives my niece a party so that she has these pictures and videos to look back on down the road. I think they should talk to my brother and tell him to step up and do their own thing instead of pushing everything onto me and my husband. So WIBTA?

EDIT: Thanks everyone for your advice and input. I'd like to say a few more things...

1. CATERING AND VENUE FOR A 3 YEAR OLD'S BIRTHDAY PARTY. Maybe I used the wrong words here. We were looking at an indoor play place versus just renting out a community room with some tables and space for games. The party is in the wintertime, so we can't just do something outdoors. By catering, I meant either choosing which food package we would select at the play place, or if we went the other route, figuring out how much Filipino food to get. Or pizza, I don't know. 

2. MY BROTHER HAS NO LIMITS TO ASKING ME TO HELP PLAN FOR MY NIECE. Believe it or not, he's asked me to plan her baptism party...I said no. 

3. WILL MY NIECE REALLY LOOK BACK AT ALL OF THESE EVENTS AND BE JEALOUS? Maybe, but maybe not. Sometimes I feel bad that my husband and I have adopted the parenting lifestyle of fully immersing our son into our lives, while it seems that my brother and SIL have not done the same for their daughter. We take our son on vacations; to weddings and social events (when allowed); and we take him to parks, play places, play dates, and so on. He's done a parent and toddler swim class and gymnastics class, and we just enrolled him in a toddler soccer class where they just run around and kick balls. My niece hasn't done anything because they think she's too young to do anything and she's too young to even remember doing any of these things. While that may be true, I don't necessarily think that's a good reason to not do these activities or throw a birthday party. I hope this makes sense.

She helped for several weeks but I got easily overwhelmed by her & ignored her for about 3 weeks.



On Monday, I had asked her if on Thurs, she would watch my puppy when I went to a Dr’s appointment. She agreed. On Tues, we had an incident & she didn’t want to talk about that on Tues or Wed.



When she got here she texted from her son’s car that she was ready for me to hand her my puppy’s leash. I texted back to ask if she planned to be outside the whole time I was gone. She said she was prepared to do so. 



She comes inside & asks if I would give her a temporary code to the front door. I said “no, absolutely not”. She asked for the “remote control” to the garage door.



She said I had given her the remote before. I told her not anymore, not after she left it in the unlocked car 2 days earlier. She had been borrowing my mother’s car for weeks to get back & forth to my house & run puppy errands.



She explained to me that she thought I was coming out to the car after she arrived. I told her that’s not a good enough excuse.



She started to say something about leaving the garage door open. I tell her “I’m not going to argue with you right now”. She says “fine, I’ll stay outside. I’m not going to be confined to the house”.

I lose it & yell at her “I don’t give a f\*\*\*, Anne”.



She asks how she’s supposed to potty my puppy. I told her she can take the puppy in the back. She asks “are we ready for that?”



I lose it again & I say “Oh my F\*\*\*\*ing God” because she thinks the backyard is unsafe for the puppy because the landscaper hasn’t picked up all the thorns.



She asked me if I was giving her my treat bag. I asked her if she wanted my bag. She said no & got up, said she’ll grab her other bag & walked out to her son’s car. She gets in the car & then proceeds to wait in the car. The van eventually arrives, so I put my puppy in her crate.



I answered the door, where she was knocking & told her my puppy was crated & I no longer needed her services that day. She was trying to walk into my house & said she wanted to get some stuff. I told her she could coordinate with me later to get what she needed.



She still stood there. I asked her to “please go.” She told me to take something (the kibble she grabbed earlier) from her. I told her I didn’t want to take anything from her.

So quick backstory. I made a friend online a few years ago (I shall refer to them as X) and we got along really well. After some time, I started visiting semi frequently. We live in two different countries but it is only 2 hours away via plane so it's not a big deal.

This time when I arrived, the house was hermit levels of untidy, and I did my best while X was busy with a project.

The first point of contention was that when it came to going out and doing things, I would always end up leaving it to X to plan out. This was obviously problematic as it caused them unnecessary stress while I did nothing, but it was one of those things i was doing without realising.

To be fair on X, I was told several times about this. The same applies to me not being proactive with keeping their place clean or getting groceries and having to be told to do it. Now most of these problems are probably linked to my ADHD but I admit myself that it isn't at all an excuse.

Now to the incident in question. Eventually everything I previously mentioned came to a head. I had volunteered to fly out to X and look after their home  and pets while they were at an event. I do admit in hindsight that i did the bare minimum instead of being more proactive and going the extra mile like I said I would do.

They came home and then got annoyed at me, which is more than fair. But as the next two days progressed, X locked themself in their room and refused to come out, only speaking to me via text. That is when I started talking to a mutual friend (let's call them Y) explaining the situation. 

After 2 days, I woke up, did the usual morning chores, but then recieved a message telling me to grab my shit and get out, no chance to talk things out, I had to leave there and then in a foreign country with not much money and nowhere to go. 

Of course I left as the last thing I'd want to do is cause a close friend to be uncomfortable in their own home. That's when I reached out to Y again, this time explaining the development. I don't know what Y said, bit this enraged X even more with claims that I was smack talking. X then proceeded to block me on all platforms.

I did eventually make it home after 48 hours, having to sleep in one of the worst airports in Europe and generally being exhausted and smelling like death when I got home.

I'll be the first to admit that I did make mistakes. but I'm unsure If the reaction to what I did wrong was really warranted in relation to everything. 

tl;dr

Upset a friend by making several mistakes that piled up, got left wandering the streets of a foreign country trying to find a way home.

edit: I did vacuum, load and unload the diswasher, clean up after myself, feed and water the animals, walk the dog and do general house chores etc. What I didn't do was major things I promised I would do like clean out the bird cages which seemingly had not been cleaned for years like I promised and spent a lot of my time just watching TV.

edit 2: I want to clear up that I did not mess up the house myself, when I arrived it was in a terrible state, dirty dishes all over the kitchen which I cleared up, months old food in the fridge that I threw away.

45,1eo8htf,AITAH for asking my BIL to wash his hands?,"My husband & I were going to the movies. We asked my husband's brother to go with us. I love my BIL. He's an amazing man and I love spending time with him. At the theater, we purchased a large popcorn and drinks. I'm a bit of a germaphobe and have a bit of OCD when it comes to certain things. My husband is very clean, as am I. We always wash our hands before and after eating. It's automatic and a habit we don't even think much about anymore. Prior to the movie, we both washed our hands but I noticed my BIL did not. We would be sharing popcorn and the thought of his germy hands touching my food appalled me. He's a clean person, it's not that. But I don't know when he last washed his hands. We were in the car where he was touching door handles, the steering wheel, gear shift, cell phone, the doors to the theater and whatever else I don't know about. I asked him if he could please go wash his hands. He looked surprised but complied. 

I guess he said something to my husband because my husband later told me I was rude to his brother and this one time I could have let my ""phobias"" go. It wasn't like I was demanding; I asked politely and my BIL complied without issue. I honestly don't see what's wrong with asking someone to wash their hands when we'd all be sharing food from the same container. But my husband said my BIL is not a child and if I was offended by the lack of hand washing, I didn't have to eat any of the popcorn. He is correct, of course. It didn't occur to me at the time. Now I feel like the AH. I told my husband I would apologize to my BIL as it was never my intention to be rude or make him do something he didn't want to. My husband told me to drop it.

I should point out, my BIL is well aware of my germ aversion and fears of cross contamination. I almost died once when I contracted an food-related illness when working in another country. I had a sustained fever over 104F for many days and was in the ICU for 9 days not knowing if I'd live or die. Since then, I've been paranoid as my system will forever be weakened and I am suseptible.

46,1eo8205,AITA for calling my toxic aunt out in front of everyone ,"Yesterday, I (15M) got into a huge argument with my aunt (38) in front of the whole family.

For context, my aunt is usually nice but very demanding. She expects everyone, including the kids, especially me, to help prepare for events, which we do voluntarily. However, she doesn't seem to realize we're not obligated to do this. She can also be mean to many family members, yet no one speaks up because she hosts all the family gatherings. For example, she constantly argues with my younger aunt and makes fun of her, and she criticizes my big sister, calling her ugly and questioning her life choices. Recently, she’s even been mean to my older cousin. My aunt is a micromanager and often mocks everyone in front of the family. I always help her with events—decorating, cooking, cleaning—but it’s never enough, and she criticizes everything I do.

Yesterday, while helping her before a family gathering, she started criticizing my sister for wanting to delay university by two years, calling her lazy. My mom didn't defend my sister, which upset me. Later, I set the tables, but my aunt didn’t like how I arranged the papers, even though I followed her instructions. She called her husband over to make fun of me in front of my little cousin. When I was in the kitchen, my mom asked me where someone was, and I told her I couldn’t help because I was already assisting several people. My aunt overheard and snapped at me to stop helping and leave, which I did without arguing.

During dinner prep, I overheard my aunt insulting my grandparents, who are both very sick, for wanting to share a plate. I told her it wasn’t a big deal and she should let it go. This triggered her, and she screamed at me, asking if I had a problem. I might be the asshole, but I raised my voice and told her she couldn’t keep criticizing everyone for minor things and micromanage. Then I walked away. Many family members followed me, saying I was right but shouldn’t have disrupted the peace. They admitted they don’t speak up because they want to avoid drama, and my younger cousin, sister, and aunt confided that they don’t feel taken seriously. Several family members shared similar experiences, which is why my cousin avoids going to my aunt’s house.

During dinner, my grandma comforted me and acknowledged how aggressive my aunt can be. I then loudly stated that I knew I was right because many family members had shared similar stories with me. I realize this was petty and hurtful, as knowing so many people feel this way must be painful.

Today, I expected my parents to support me, but they instead criticized me. My mom said my aunt called her, saying she couldn’t sleep and was deeply hurt by what I said. My dad told me I was petty and disrespectful, especially since my aunt is a new mother. However, I don’t think that excuses her behavior because she treated my younger aunt similarly even before becoming a mother.

Days later I received another assurance that the cards would be shipped and I would receive proof soon.

Normally I would have way over reacted to make it correct seeing as it was my mistake. But here’s the thing

It has been 6 days since this transaction and I’ve had two promises to see tracking information to no avail. The way that he immediately blows up my inbox and comments on multiple posts of mine at once is annoying plus he didn’t provide any photos of the supposed empty package so how am I to know that he is not the one scamming me? 

I thought to just block him and eat the loss but on the chance I did make a mistake I attempted to extend a line for if I did get the cards that were supposed to come to me. At that point I would know he’s not scamming and I would make it right. He again doubled down on how awful I am and insisted he would be interrupting his package.

Firstly if someone is out there scamming people for $7 worth of cards lmk I can get you a McDouble bro. Secondly if you think something is up with a transaction at least send one decent message before berating people. If he had just said “uhh what’s this” with a picture he would’ve walked away with $10 worth of cards and $10 in his PayPal.

49,1eo7oiy,AITAH - BIL wants amp he gave me 12 years ago back.,"A little back story. I am nearing the end of a not messy at all divorce. My ex and I have child together and are very good at co-parenting. Anyway, my ex received a text from her brother. In it he asked her to ask me if I would return a guitar amp that he had given me nearly 12 years ago. 

My BIL and I have always been good with each other. Both of us are musicians, so we always have things in common. He's a great guy that I will always keep in contact with. I will always consider him family.

Going back to the guitar amp...we were visiting my BIL (we live 4 hrs apart) for a long weekend. I saw his Marshall combo amp sitting in his garage. I asked, almost scolded, him as to why his Marshall was there? I was told that he had blown the amp. It no longer worked. No volume and spotty power. I asked what he was planning on doing with it? I was told he most likely was going to put it to the curb. So, I asked if I could have it. I have a friend that might be able to fix it. He agreed. I spent a modest amount of money on parts and lots of evenings sitting with my friend modding the amp to get the desired tones from it. 

When word got to BIL that his sister were on the outs, he asked me to please not sell or trade the amp without offering it up to him first. I assured him that I will never give up that amp. If I go homeless...I'll be sitting on that amp on the corner begging for change!

Now that our divorce is weeks from being finalized, he sent my ex that text.
In it he said that his son, now 21, was hoping that the amp would have been gifted to him when he was old enough and that he is disappointed that his dad gave it away. I'm not a monster. I understand sentimental value. What is forgotten is that the amp was fried when I took ownership and it was, most likely, hitting the curb. I spent hard earned cash and countless hours working on it. It has been my gigging amp through 3 different bands. There is a lot of sentimental value with me too. In fact, even though I'm not currently in a band, I use the amp 3-5 times a week.

So, am I the asshole for not being willing to return the amp so my nephew can have it?

P.s.

She told me it's body spray and that it smells really good. I've gotten in trouble in the past for saying that her perfume is gross smelling so I bite my tongue. Then she opens it and I told her not to spray it. She said it smelled good and sprayed some in the car. And not just like one little spray, like FOUR PUMPS. I could feel the particles falling onto my skin and it made me really upset and all I could smell was the perfume and it was very alcoholicly strong and so I immediately opened the window.

My sister told me to close the window and I said no because the car smelled too much like perfume. It was also a little wet outside so it did get a little bit of water in the car but not that much because it was just a drizzle. After about 2 minutes I closed the window again. Mum said I overreacted and that I need to be respectful of my sister's perfume because she spent her money on it and I'm being rude about it. I told her that I feel very very upset by strong scents, which she knoiws because she was there for my diagnosis of autism, and she said I should have been nicer about it but I asked my sister to please not spray it and she didn't listen.

None of our kids have phones yet, so about 6 months ago we had a talk with all 3 of them to talk about what they should do if they ever get lost, in danger, need help, etc.  One of the things we talked about was them knowing both mine and my wife's phone numbers.  I even made some flashcards with our numbers in addition to their grandparent's numbers so that they could memorize them.  We kind of turned it into a game to help them learn and it worked great.

During that time, it came up that my wife doesn't know my phone number by heart.  In fact, she doesn't have any phone numbers memorized anymore.  I told her that she should at least have mine and someone else's (like her mom) memorized in case she can't use her phone and she needs to get a hold of someone.  She told me I was overreacting and that it isn't a big deal.  She then asked if I have her number memorized and I railed it off to her without hesitation.  Along with my mom's, dad's, and my younger brother's.  

Well, a couple weeks ago, she was at a work event about an hour from where we live.  She somehow managed to lock her purse in her car.  Her purse had her car keys and her phone inside.  So, she had no way to get home and no way to call me.  Thankfully, a coworker of hers was willing to drive her home.  But then we had to pile all 3 kids into the car and drive an hour to get her car and then drive back home.  

Of course, one thing that came up during that drive was that my wife had no way to contact me because she doesn't know my number.  If she had my number memorized, I could have brought her keys to her and saved her coworker the inconvenience.  She got very defensive about it which I'm sure was because of embarrassment.  But I used the situation as an example and told her that if it was an emergency instead, then it would be a much bigger problem.  She eventually agreed that she would try to memorize some phone numbers.

Naturally, since we already had flashcards at home for this very reason, I figured it would be a good way to help her learn.  I got the kids involved as well just to reinforce that memorization for them.  Problem was that my wife couldn't memorize the numbers.  My kids knew them all by heart, even the 5-year-old.  My wife got frustrated and embarrassed.

She said she would just write numbers on a piece of paper and put it in her purse.  I had to remind her that idea would do absolutely no good if she locked her purse in the car again or lost it.  She got upset with me and told me that no one memorizes numbers anymore and that even if it was an emergency, she would figure something out.

I told her that's not good enough for me.  I told her I don't care how frustrating or embarrassing it is for her, but she needs to memorize at least my number and someone else's.  She told me I am being a big jerk about this and making it into a huge deal when it doesn't need to be.

52,1eo6l7l,AITA for not letting my sister in the bathroom connected to my room ?,"Pretty tame/petty compared to other stuff here, but I still want to know if I'm an idiot or not, since this type of thing is not uncommon.

So my mom, sister (14) and I (16),are staying in someone else's house for one week during vacation. We have one bedroom each and there's two bathrooms. One is on the second floor and the other is right next to one of the bedrooms, with a single door for both rooms. You can see the bedroom from the bathroom with no separation. I sleep in this room, my mom and sister in rooms on the second floor. 

Context : yesterday was very tiring, we walked a lot and got back late. So today I wanted to relax alone in my room, I like my privacy and sleeping naked, so I locked the door.  

Issue is, my sister wants to use the bathroom connect to my room because ""she can see herself better in this one's mirror"", so the day before she had left stuff in there. She wants me to open the door and let her use the bathroom, I say no cause I'm naked, and I don't want to see anyone anyway. She asked maybe two more times before she starts yelling at me with her ""You're pathetic"" voice, and my mom goes to pull up the shutters from outside so she can look at me while she yells at me too I guess ?
That did a great job at pissing me off, and I can admit that I'm quite petty, so I didn't let her in even when she just requested to pick up the stuff she had left. I ended up opening the door enough to put her bag on the floor. 

Now my mom is mad at me for it, but couldn't she use the other bathroom in the first place ?  I really value my alone time and they both know it. Like if she wanted this one so bad she could've left me the room upstairs, but she wouldn't do that either (I did ask).

What we go back and forth on, is there lack of involvement when it comes down to our son. For context, his mother and sisters have always tolerated me and we once had a great relationship, but that all changed after our son was born.

Since his birth, my partner's mother and sister's have behaved grossly toward our son and us.

54,1eo65y8,"AITA for ‘looking’ at a video game skin with a large behind, making my wife mad or insecure? ","Throwaway for privacy reasons


So, I (34M) am a big gamer. Usually im playing after work to calm myself down, but that’s besides the story. I've been playing this one game for a while now, since it came out in 2013, and they recently released a new character skin called ""Ember heirloom” To give you a bit of context, this skin has a very noticeable feature: a large, very detailed behind. The game itself is pretty intense, with lots of enemies often so l get really focused while playing, but I can't deny that this skin is hard to miss, even in the midst of missions.

Yesterday, I was in the middle of a long session on my off day, and my wife walked into the room while I was playing. She saw me customizing my character in the customization screen, however the character was turned all the way around so the behind was visible. She looked at the screen and asked what I was so focused on, since I was squinting pretty hard. I explained that I was just playing the game and kind of jokingly mentioned how this new skin has been distracting a lot of players because of how it looks.


She didn't seem amused. In fact, she got really upset and asked me why I was staring at a ""virtual butt"" (yes, I know.) when I'm a married man. I tried to explain that it's just a game and that I wasn't actually staring at it, it's just something that pops up while I'm playing or testing out new customization colors. I even told her that the character in the video game isn’t technically alive even in the game. But I took a look at her, and she really wasn't having it. She stormed off, saying that it was disrespectful to her and that I shouldn't be looking at other women, even if their fictional or not. She’s been mad at me since, and I’ve also sort of been wondering if I made her feel insecure or like I don’t like her appearance. 

Now, I get that maybe I could of been more sensitive about it, but it mostly didn't
seem like a big deal to me at that moment. I wasn’t trying to disrespect her or anything, or make her feel bad. At the end of the day it’s just a video game, and the skin is designed to grab attention, which it had caught in my situation. However not in a way that feels serious to me or anything. I’ve been going back and forth with myself and I’m unsure if I should apologize or not.

56,1eo5x4e,AITA for expecting my parents to help me get back on my feet,"Ok so not exactly as the title says but I (21f) am currently living at home with my parents and my sister for the summer. I dropped out of college in the spring because I didn’t have a passion and had changed my major too many times. I’m taking 2-3 years to figure my life out. Well my parents already don’t love that. They wanted me to have the traditional experience even though it was seriously not working for me and led to some mental health issues I’m still working out a bit. Well I’ve been home since May and have worked since June up until last week. My job was seasonal and also my dad is my boss. I didn’t have a second job lined up when it ended but I do now. Me not having a job lined up was also a huge issue. All summer while I’ve been living at home I haven’t paid rent and have been a great employee for my dad. My sister was home as well from school and we were all together as a family. Now my sister is getting ready to leave they want to know my plan. Well my plan is to work and move out in oct/nov. I don’t want to live with them forever but I’m trying to save up right now and I had debt to pay off with the money from my summer job. 

That’s the backstory and some context.
So here’s where I ask if I’m TAH:

My parents drew up a contract for me to continue to live with them through Oct/nov. 
basically I have to pay $512 a month to live with them (rent, phone, groceries, etc.) and adhere to strict rules. No friends over, no going to a friends without permission, no leaving unless they know where I’m going, no sleepovers at someone else’s unless it’s cleared well in advance, 9pm curfew, 11pm bedtime. No sleeping in past 7:30am. AND volunteer 6 hrs a week to “find myself and help people” (it’s not really relevant but no one in my family volunteers other than me and I have about 150 hrs of volunteer work in many different areas). 

So I blew up at that and said there’s no way in hell I’m paying $512 a month to live as a 15 year old when I’m 2 months away from being 22. And we got into a huge fight. I just wanted a little help and support to figure out where I’m going with my life. Now they are saying I’m ungrateful and unkind and other parents would just throw their kids on the street and I should consider myself lucky. So AITA? Am I being ungrateful?  

Edit to clarify: my original plan was to move out by August but because of some debt I owed for school I didn’t have a comfortable amount to move out and my mom has forbid me from living in some of the cheaper neighbors I looked at because “it’s dangerous”. They offered to let me stay until 2025 in mid July without any stipulations and only now as my sister is leaving did all of this get sprung on me. They weren’t even going to originally have me pay rent but I suggested $200 and they said verbally they thought that was fine. 3 weeks later they have a written document that’s completely different. 

ETA: 2-3 years to figure my life out isn’t exactly what I meant. I just meant I’m ok with working odd jobs until I find something I like and try to move up in or I decided to go back to school online. 

ETA2: I’m ok with the rent OR the rules. Not both. That’s where I think they are being unfair and my gripes about that aren’t just me being ungrateful.

I just need unbiased opinion cause everyone is asking me to forgive and move on.

Background Story:

I ‘25/f’ have a friend, whom I will call Jane ’25/f’. We went through the whole process of moving abroad for our Master's together, applied for visas together, and endured the stress of moving abroad alone, along with classes and assignments. We moved last April and have been close ever since, doing almost everything together.

In April this year, we had a disagreement. We were supposed to go to a place she wanted to visit, and I planned to tag along. However, I had to cancel because I needed to sort out some issues for my dad, which I informed her about. We were supposed to go out on a Thursday, but I called on Tuesday to cancel and asked if we could reschedule to Saturday or Monday because of our work schedules. She seemed upset about the cancellation since we had been postponing this outing for a month, but we agreed to go somewhere else on Saturday.

Saturday came, and I didn’t hear from her. I expected her to let me know when she got back from work, but since she didn't message me, I didn’t message her either. On Sunday, we had a class together. When I arrived, she raised her voice, telling me not to sit with her. At first, I thought she was joking, but since she was shouting, another friend in the class told me not to sit with her, so I didn’t. 

After class, I hoped we could talk and resolve everything, but she was nowhere to be found. I called her to ask if she had left, and she said yes. I was upset and admit that I said something unkind, telling her she had a bad attitude and then ended the call.

After that day we didn’t talk for two months because I decided that I was going to match her energy and see if she would reach out first. 
She reached out after two months and gave a flimsy apology and claims she needed time to get over me hanging up the phone and telling her she had a bad attitude. 

Note: I know this is just my own side of the story and that I probably have a bit of resentment from other times we have had arguments and I always have to reach out first. 

All in all, I have mentally checked out from the friendship and I would rather not be a dishonest friend so I just need to know what to do.

All in all, I have mentally checked out from the friendship and I would rather not be a dishonest friend so I just need to know what to do.

58,1eo5hbh,AITA for telling my child's step-mother to grow up and stop asking a teenager for support?,"I (39F) have two children, Kimmy, (14F) and (9M) and share custody with their father, Dave. Kimmy is starting high school soon and her school sent a list of their extracurriculars. I want my children to be academically inclined and join clubs to meet people. I told Kimmy to pick some clubs, and as of right now she picked out 10 (which we are definitely going to shorten down).

Kimmy sent a list of clubs to her father so he could help her. He didn't respond and instead, I got a call from Dave's wife, Amy, a little later. Amy asked me if Kimmy was really going to join all of those clubs, and I said not all but probably some of them.

Amy followed by asking if Kimmy could only join one of the clubs on her list, which confused me. I asked why. Amy explained that she has to go to work soon, and she really needs someone to take care of her kids. She was hoping that Kimmy would be able to go to their house straight after school and take care of them.

Amy has 3 kids under 13, and recently had a baby with Dave. Kimmy has ADHD which makes it hard for her to care for her own needs. I already feel extremely uncomfortable leaving her with 4 kids that young unattended. Amy didn't even mention transportation and how Kimmy would get there. I told her no.

This upset Amy. She told me that Kimmy is a part of her family too, and as a family they all need to chip in and according to her, Kimmy should chip in by babysitting. She ranted on, giving me a sob story as to how she was struggling already with Dave working, how hard it was to be mom to 4 kids who depend on her so much, and how expensive childcare was nowadays.

I told her no, and why I was uncomfortable, to which she just reiterated her story (this happened twice). By this time, I said no 3 times and she was still asking. I thought it was clear that no meant no, not no and ask again later. I interrupted her and told her no is my final answer and she's honestly pathetic to ask a 14-year-old for support and it sounds she needs to grow up instead of relying on children to pick up her slack.

As you would expect, Amy and Dave are upset at me, which I don't really mind. My only issue is that when I told my sister, she thought I was being cruel which is making me rethink things. AITA?

Edit: A common question I'm being asked is what custody looks like. My kids go to their father's one week every month and stay with me for the rest. But there are times where they stay at their father's longer than expected (with my permission). For instance, the kids stayed a couple weeks at their father for the summer. Sometimes they stay an extra few days, but the custody is officially me 3/4 and him 1/4, with me being their primary caregiver.

Edit2: A lot of you guys are asking about Amy's kids. The oldest is around my son's age albeit a bit older, and I literally have no idea if their father is helping them or if they have the same father because it's none of my business and those are not at all my kids.

Edit3: While I'm very glad a lot you fellow millennials liked The Babysitter Club, can you please stop using it as a reference? I've read some ridiculous comments on this post, but using fictional 12-year-olds who acted like teenagers as a reason for my child to babysit are one of the most ridiculous ones I've seen. That's like if I used Aladdin to prove why my kids should get a genie.

Edit4: Additionally, I don't think struggling moms should be bashed, but they should be treated like humans and need to know when boundaries were crossed. Dave and I have been co-parenting for a while, so there was a time when I was in Amy's shoes and wondering what I would do with my kiddos. A thought that did not cross my mind was asking a minor to unwillingly drop all of their interests. There's a difference between setting boundaries and knowing my child can't take on a responsibility and simply wanting to put a struggling mother down just because it was another Tuesday.

59,1eo5e0i,AITA for skipping activities when my parents say I can’t wear my headphones?,"My parents took me (20f) and my sisters (21f, 19f, 17f) on a family vacation to Mexico. My sisters and I are all sharing a room. 

I am audhd and my sisters all have adhd. They are all very loud, like their normal volume is yelling, and they multitask so they’ll have 3 conversations and 2 TikTok’s going full volume with no headphones. What I’m trying to say is being with them is constant overstimulation. 

I have 3 more days on this trip and there’s absolutely nowhere for me to go to cool down. If I leave the room they follow me. If I go to the room they either follow me there and try to drag me out or constantly call me and tell me to get out of the room. 

Since I can’t escape them, I’ve resorted to wearing my Noise canceling headphones pretty much 24/7. I take them off to sleep or swim and that’s it. 

The headphones thing pisses my parents off so much. They think the constant overstimulation and being around my sisters is good for me and will teach me social skills (I never got support for the autism and adhd because even though I was diagnosed at 8, I was not told until I was 19 and they thought I’d figure out social skills and school shit and everything else I struggle with). They’ve started saying I can’t join them if I have my headphones on so I just don’t join them. I get room service for at least 1 meal a day (all inclusive hotel), I don’t go to the pool all the time, don’t go to the night activities, leave dinner early. I basically stay in the room for half the day.

60,1eo5aio,AITA for leaving my friend at a festival ,"I (27 F) went to a festival with my good friend of 14 years (28 F). Everything was good and we were having fun. She picked me up that night and I had warned her that I couldn’t stay too late because I had to wake up early the next day cause I had plans with my family. She kinda dismissed me but I didn’t think too much of it. When the time came, she didn’t wanna leave anymore, telling me whether I leave now or later, that I wouldn’t change anything in life, that if I was too tired, I could just sleep tomorrow. To which I asked if I could get my stuff from her car so I could go home and she she could stay there and enjoy herself but she wouldn’t let me. She actually kept saying to sacrifice myself for her. So I had no choice than to wait until she was ready to leave. The drive back home was completely silent. I ended up texting her a couple of days after to explain how I felt. She never answered.

A week later, I texted her again to see if she was still down to go another festival that we had already gotten the tickets for. That was my mistake. I realize I shouldn’t have texted her before fixing what had happened at that first festival.  She said she was still down to go.

Basically the same thing happened again, but this time I left. 
The whole night felt already weird: we were not really talking to each other. The vibes were off. I was not enjoying myself. 
Again I warned her that I was planning on staying until the end cause I didn’t wanna be stuck in the metro with the whole crowd. When I decided to leave, she snapped and basically guilt tripped me into staying, saying stuff like : you have no reason to leave, I worked out today and I played tennis and I’m still here even though I’m tired, you can sleep tomorrow and me in working, you’re not puking or dying, how dare you think it’s okay for you to leave? If I did that to one of my friend I would never be able to sleep at night, you’re juste waiting your money and your ticket, we have different values and principles, etc. 
After that speech I was even more sure that I wanted to leave, so I left and she stayed.

The day after, she texts me to tell me how she feels but not once in her text did she say “I feel”, it was just “you did this” “you did that”
It was really accusatory more than sharing how she felt. She ended that text saying she didn’t wanna be friends anymore.

Rosalie had plans for her birthday. We were supposed to go to Santa Cruz but my husband got laid off back in May and he has a new job but he didn't feel comfortable taking any vacations since he's still ""new"" to his company. She accepted that and made new plans, she wanted to go shopping and then spend most of the day at home. I took her shopping and she got a few things (thankfully she doesn't have expensive tastes,,, yet) and took her to a movie. 

However, I ended up changing a few things. When we bought Rosalie her cake, she wanted cheesecake but she's the only one who likes that in our house so I made her pick one we could all enjoy and ended up settling for a chocolate cake with whipped frosting which she ended up not eating because she ""didn't like it."" Jamie also got to blow out the candles first since he doesn't understand that Rosalie's birthday is her day, and is too young to understand yet. She was upset with this and said that we made the blowing out candles about him. I reminded her that he can't understand that they're meant for her yet and she went quiet. My husband brought out one of those musical candles that plays a song when blown out and when she tried blowing it out it didn't work which upset her even more. The final straw was the fact that she didn't get any presents. Admittedly we were so caught up in other things that we didn't buy her any gifts, but I thought what she bought in town would've compensated for it. Her grandma sent her a present, but she accidentally sent her something meant for one of her cousins. She ended up getting upset over the lack of presents and it felt a little entitled.

Eventually she got upset and yelled at us, saying that her birthday sucked. I reminded her about her shopping spree and movie and she said that wasn't enough. We had a little back and forth but now she's grounded and upset with me. My husband is on my side but my mother (same grandma that sent her the cousin's present) is angry at me and called me an AH.

I, F(26) don't want to work at least for now. My first experience of working is in my early 20s in college. It was like an odd job here and there. I wanted to work part time at nearby malls but my parents forbid me to do so cuz they say they still can support me. 

So, I moved back home and when I wanna work, my parents like told me no? Cuz I have to take care of the house and my younger siblings while they are working. After like months, I snapped and secretly moved out and went to find a job out of state. It's like 4 hours drive from my home state.

I landed a retail job. I came back home and told my parents about it They were reluctant to accept but I told them, I would make time and will visit them once every month despite the cost, the time, the work.

I made it work. And besides my retail job, I also do part time jobs during my off days. I kept this a s a secret from my parents but I love working. One day, my relative who visited the state on a vacation found me working part time. They told my parents and my parents forced me to quit the job and worked at their friend's company at home.

I told them, I'll come home but I wanna find my own job. They lashed out and said I should work with their friend. On my first day, I told them, I'm down with a cold and couldn't work for a few days. They still want me to work. When I didn't come to work because of my cold, it became an issue with my parents and their friend.

I was scolded at home when I'm still down with the cold and only then I'm allowed to resign. Then I got a good job offer outstate with a good pay and career opportunity. But of course, my parents disapprove and I have to turn it down.

They say they want me to work 9-5 job, with a big pay, close to home with a big pay. That is impossible with my experience and place.

65,1eo4mp2,WIBTA if I lied to my grandfather/boss? ,"Edit: Made the choice to talk to him. Leave a comment if you want. But issue is concluded 

Ok, so for the past 10 years, I've worked at a family business. My grandfather owns the store, my grandmother does accounting, and I work there during the summer and holidays from school. 

It's obviously nice to have guaranteed work, especially since it's really hard to get a job, especially a job that you can just go back to at any time. However I'm not dumb, and I can see the business is slowly winding down. We used to average around $700-$800 a day, but now the average is a lot closer to $300. In September my grandfather is turning 84 and my grandmother is turning 80. It's really feeling like it's time to wind down the business. 

However, my grandfather has got this idea in his head. Basically a customer asked if he sold this certain American product (We live in Canada) and since then he's been hell bent on bringing in a whole line of them. It's been incredibly stressful for me because he's appointed me as the leader in conversation around these products, sending me to the bank and having me call and collect information and deal with arranging for the brokers. He wants everything done immediately and is very disappointed with my performance so far.

We made a deal with a guy in New Jersey, but it fell through when he wanted $6000 in shipping and handling, not even the products. This was when I finally got to learn how much it was going to cost to get everything over here. I thought we were only getting the one item, but for a whole line it'll be like $10,000. 

So now he wants me to find another salesman to make a cheaper deal with. Someone who's closer to the border. I know he's a grown man and can make whatever business decisions he wants, but I don't see us turning a profit on this merchandise for many years. And partially I want to protect my inheritance. $10,000 USD is enough to put me through school for a year without working.

WIBTA if I lied and told him there's no one nearby to make the deal with? There is a closer option, but he doesn't really understand technology so I doubt he'd ever find out. I'm leaving for school in two weeks and I don't want to put up with more stress and leave some deal half finished. 

--------------

Edit: I took y'all's decision and talked to him. It didn't go great, he just scoffed at me and said I didn't know anything and should just leave it all to him, and refused to talk any further. 

At least I got out of this that I don't actually care about the money, I was blinding myself with that really. I'm scared that I don't have the same relationship that I used to with him. My whole family has been talking about money and retirement, so I was thinking it was all about that. I'm not capable of doing this work for him and that's what's making me anxious. A multi-thousand dollar international deal is out of my wheelhouse. I'll put my foot down about that at least. I'm done talking to all these big influential people on his behalf. 

A lot have been saying to quit, but to me that's elder abuse, no one else is willing to help him. At least when I'm here, he can rest for a while and actually take a lunch break. When I'm gone he just works all day straight by himself, so I don't feel like I'll ever quit. ",Asshole,2024-08-09,"WIBTA if I lied to my grandfather/boss?  Edit: Made the choice to talk to him.

66,1eo4fvp,AITA for asking my fiancé to shorten a certain choreographed dance at our reception?,"
So it is tradition in my soon to be wife’s family to do a choreographed dance with the women on her mom’s side at the bride’s wedding. I guess it started when my finance’s mom got married and her sisters surprised her with a choreographed dance at the reception and a new song and dance moves are added for each wedding when a woman on their side gets married (the bride now participates too). 

The dance was performed for me without my fiancé’s addition that they haven’t added yet. Of course it’s very cute and I think it’s enjoyable and of course it’s not them doing it I have a problem with, but as I was giving them attention I started to think “how long is this thing?”… it is 13 minutes. And that was without my finances addition. I was polite and I told her I thought it was great, but I think it should be shortened a bit. She agreed, but it is now 10 minutes and I still feel that is too long. I suggested that it should be no more than 7 minutes.

This caused a bit of an argument but not a fight. I just told her that I think people (including myself) are going to be eager to get the night started and want to be out on the dance floor themselves and start mingling. I just feel like if the roles were reversed and it was me asking for this dance with the men she would agree that 10 minutes is way too long. 

I really have been polite to her about this and I haven’t been pushy. She has worked very hard planning this wedding and that’s why I feel like I should let it go, but I am also thinking about our guests and I want them to enjoy their time as much as possible.

67,1eo4cfm,"AITA for being ""snippy"" when answering my SILs question about twin names?","I'm (28f) a twin. My sister and I have matching names. By matching I don't mean like Eva and Eve. But more like Lily and Rose, Robin and Dove or Joy and Faith. We never minded. We each like our names. They do present us as a pair but it was never a problem for us. I know this is not a fact for all twins, or even siblings. I'm not afraid to say this.

My husband's sister (SIL) is pregnant, with twins. She and her husband are expecting two boys. They are not on the same page with names. SILs husband does not mind if they match like ours, but SIL does mind and she does not want it. Part of their problem is they are gravitating to names that do match. Which is why SIL asked me two months ago how I felt about my sister and my names matching as much as they do. I told her it didn't bother me at all. We never disliked it. But not everyone feels the same as us. She asked if I'd ever do it and I said maybe, if that's how it worked.

She has asked me the same question at least 20 times since that first time. Each time she takes my answer and thanks me. But it doesn't stop her from asking again. Two times ago I mentioned that I had answered it before and my thoughts had not changed so could she please stop asking the same question. She was like oh yeah sorry. Very flippant. The last time my husband told her we could all do with a different topic of conversation.

Last weekend we had some some of my husband's family over for dinner. We were all having a great time, conversation was flowing, laughs were had, and then SIL out of nowhere and interrupting the topic at the time, asks me yet again if I had a problem with twin names. I was frustrated, not going to lie. I responded with a sigh and told her no, like I told her each and every time she asked me that question, I did not have an issue with it, I never had an issue with it, I did not see that changing this week or next week. But that everyone is different when it comes to whether they care or not.

SIL told me there was no need to be so ""snippy"" because she was just asking a question. And she wanted her husband to hear the answer. My husband and his two brothers pointed out they all heard the answer at least 7 different times. His other sister said she was on her 10th time hearing me give the same answer. And that she also heard the additional info of whether I'd name twins matching names if I had them.

72,1eo3ftd,"AITA for charging my $75 cousin to take my PS5 to college, when he didn't return it when he was supposed to 4 months ago?","So I have a cousin from a poorer household that lives with my Grandmother on my mother's side, because he could get better school opportunities. Being from a poorer household, he had no video games. Or at least he did and his father would sell the systems or pawn them off.

So one weekend in April 2024, he asked could he use by PS5 for a weekend to play a Fortnite event. I agreed because it was just one weekend, and there hasn't been anything I've been dying to play since I've been going through an older series on PS3.

Every few weeks I did ask him to return it because there were games I wanted to play on it and he would never bring it. As I am currently saving to buy a car in full cash, and he doesn't live near a bus line, I have had no way to get to him. Being a busy adult with a job and a life outside of videogames I was able to make due, but it was frustrating none of the less.

So last Sunday I called my grandmother to get it from him and she said just wait until Saturday when he leaves to go to school. I said that's fine. But then a day later I get a call from my cousin asking could he borrow my PS5 in his dorm room until the end of the semester. Our family does have a consistency of helping provide for college going kids, I let my brother borrow my bicycle to get around the dorm in 2016, and when I went to school my brothers let me take our WiiU with all the games we had back in 2014. So we try to do that for each other. 

This is the conversation we had.

""You've had my PS5 since April dude, I haven't even been able to play everything I wanted without having to ask others could I come over and use there's or buying on it on my Xbox Series S (a much weaker system).""

""Yeah, but my mom said if my grades are good she'll get me one for Christmas, so we'll be straight after that. It's just going to be in my dorm room. I'll take care of it.""

""Okay fine. But I need you to bring it back Monday because I'm off until Wednesday and that'll be enough time to beat this game I've been trying to play since May.""

""I'm an hour away from home right now.

""Cool. Doesn't matter. Drop your friends off or dip and bring my PS5 back NOW.""

""Bet. I got you.""

He hung up and said he was OTW. That was 3 days ago. So yesterday I sent him a text saying ""You want to use my PS5, you owe me $75."" and then I called my grandmother and told her, in a much more gentle way, the situation and told her to relay that information to him.

My grandmother did relay this information, but she also told my mother about it (she's a gossip) and my mom is saying I'm not being fair to my cousin. I told her it wasn't about asking to use my PS5. It has been the months of disrespect in general, and this was the final straw. 

He has a job. He has no bills. If he can't give me $75 to show care shown for care given, the he can't use my PS5 (and 2 controllers too I might add). I don't regret what I did or asked but I wanted to ask others how they felt.

73,1eo38ey,AITA for telling my husband he couldn't buy another $300 reptile after losing a different one he bought 5 weeks ago? ,"My husband (42m) and I (40f) were butting heads for about 6 months because he wanted to buy a snake and I did not want one in the house at all.  I finally broke down and said if he got one I wanted nothing to do with it and that it had to be in the basement. He ended up spending about $800 on all the stuff for the snake (snake was $250 bucks alone) and the snake escaped the enclosure within 24 hours of getting it. This was 5 weeks ago and we still haven't found it. 

So now he has decided he wants to get some sort of exotic lizard that will be around $250-$350 plus he is going to need a few more accessories for it. He also said that it will outgrow the current enclosure (that was for the snake) within the year and that he will need to purchase a bigger one in the future. I started expressing my annoyance at how expensive this is getting and asked if he could get something smaller and not as expensive. He then started ranting about how I pay $200 a month for a gym membership and that I can do that but won't let him get a reptile. 

I don't think a gym membership and a reptile are even on the same level. My gym membership is for my health - an investment that will pay for itself over time.  I go to the gym 5-6 days a week so it's not like I'm paying for it and not using it. It is a crossfit type of gym with instructor led classes. I've lost 28 lbs since January and finally am feeling better about my body. To me this reptile is something he WANTS not NEEDS. It would be like me spending $1k on a new pair of shoes or something.

The next day, he texted me asking if I took his flash drive, and I realized the mixup, so I replied with “Yeah, sorry, we have the same flash drive and I thought it was mine. I’ll give it back to you when I come in today.”

Then he texted me again, telling me he’d prefer if I just destroyed it, which I thought was really extreme. So I told him it’s no big deal and I’ll just give it back to him, but he just keeps going on and on about how it’s not cool for me to take things that aren’t mine.

77,1eo2jvj,AITA for telling my dad his on/off again girlfriend can only come to my wedding if they're together when the day arrives?,"Please let me know if I'm wrong here. My dad and this woman, we'll call her ""Ann"", have been on and off for almost 20 years now. They met a year after the death of my mom, dad's first wife. They were together for a period of time. She met me (26f) and my sister (25f) briefly but they broke up. 

In total dad and Ann had 5 relationships since they met. My sister and I lived with her once. Dad was married twice in between and had four other relationships. Of all dad's relationships Ann is the only one we disliked and never got along with. We just find her too pushy, intrusive and generally we were glad when they broke up. Ann and our aunt, dad's sister and mom's best friend, also don't get along. Ann blames my aunt for me and my sister not getting along with Ann. It always seemed like she was jealous of my aunt being lifelong best friends with my mom until she died and a few years ago during one of the breakup periods, they got into a big fight where Ann accused my aunt of wanting dad to be unhappy and coming between her and me and my sister.

We never could like Ann. She tried way too hard, would try to jump into private conversations with one or both of us had with dad. We could be in one of our bedrooms and she'd still try to jump in. And if we asked to speak to just dad she'd claim she was capable of helping and maybe she'd be a better person to confide in. Dad was always wishy washy about whether he'd tell Ann it was just between him and (one of) us or if he'd tell us to let Ann in. She also put her foot in her mouth so many times about our family members or about who we looked like. Maybe she was just trying too hard to bond with us that this stuff happened. But it really did influence our opinion of her. Our not liking her was 100% the reason for one of the breakups. Another was when my sister went to live with my aunt the second time Ann moved in (I was in college).

Anne has tried to mend things, with me at least. But she invalidated my relationship with my mom, claimed it was impossible for me to miss her because I was so young when she died, and really insulted my aunt to me and questioned why I'd have a relationship with my own aunt after all she did. Not to mention calling me a child. I was 21 at the time. So not at my most developed or mature but sure as hell not an actual child.

They're talking about resuming their relationship. I'm getting married later in the year and they want her to be my dad's +1 which he doesn't have because he RSVP'd for one. But there is a way for her to be added. Only, I don't like her and without her being in a relationship with my dad, she's not welcome. Who knows if they will be together once the wedding rolls around. I told my dad Ann can only come if they're together.

78,1eo2gha,WIBTAH if I asked my husband to split the bills knowing he can't afford it?,"Would I be an AH if I told my husband we are splitting the bills?

. there is ALOT more that's happened over the years just not currently relevant to my question.A little back story that is relevant to my question.

I worked at a preschool for 3 years.  Hours were 7-330 M-F. My son was free while I worked. I paid a reduced rate plus the church (which was part of the preschool) paid for part of my daughters. She is now going into kindergarten this year and my stepdaughter is going into 7th.  
Early into the school year I found out I was pregnant. The assistant director we had left. The new assistant director had it out for me. Was harder on me then anyone else, blamed me for everything, gave little to no support and threatened id lose my position because i asked to leave earlier from not feeling well not to mention I had a rough class of 3yr olds. 25 kids and about 5-6 of them were aggressive towards me, towards each other, threw chairs, toys. I constantly had to call the parents and the rules always changed on sending home. 
I've always made more money than my husband. Paid most bills with just my income but I don't make enough to cover all and we live paycheck to paycheck. 
When I went on unpaid maternity leave it was hard. But by the grace of God we made it. 
By 6weeks postpartum I was ready to go back to work. I looked for other work because of how rough it was. I got a job offer for a higher position, slightly more pay and less stressful but hours would be 2-10 wed - sun and no childcare. I had my worries with waking up with the baby throughout the night ( we formula feed) and getting up with the other kids in the morning. I need sleep too. 
My husband wanted me to take the position. He reassured me that he would step up and feed the baby at night and help with the kids and the house, make dinner get the kids bathed and to the bed because I work fulltime and he works part time. So I accepted the job offer and it's been about a month now. 
He has gotten up with the baby maybe 5 times not constantly. I even try to wake him and he tells me no. He always has a rough night or a headache and never gets up with the kids. He complains I don't help enough with the house, doesn't give the kids a bath so I give them one in the morning when I'm home, barely makes dinner, sometimes he just gives them waffles or cereal ( we made a menu that's every week that I buy for and he knows how to make), there's been several times I asked him not to let his daughter(12)  feed the baby or carry him around. (She's clumsy, doesn't feed the baby correctly, I'm afraid she won't support his head or pick him up correctly.)  And he's done it several times if not everyday when I'm not there. School is starting in a few days and I have to wake up and take them to school. 
He just lost his job because he got a second one and it was a conflict of interest. He's a hairstylist. He was getting hourly VS commission and now it's straight commission and he doesn't have a huge or even moderate clientele. He's always asking for us to be intimate with each other but i literally dont want to but give in because he gets upset if i say no and i dont want the problem. ( the last time he said he was going to divorce me when i refused) I'm just tired at this point. I'm tired of having to figure out the bills, the kids and the house.

. there is ALOT more that's happened over the years just not currently relevant to my question.A little back story that is relevant to my question.

I worked at a preschool for 3 years.  Hours were 7-330 M-F. My son was free while I worked. I paid a reduced rate plus the church (which was part of the preschool) paid for part of my daughters. She is now going into kindergarten this year and my stepdaughter is going into 7th.  
Early into the school year I found out I was pregnant. The assistant director we had left. The new assistant director had it out for me. Was harder on me then anyone else, blamed me for everything, gave little to no support and threatened id lose my position because i asked to leave earlier from not feeling well not to mention I had a rough class of 3yr olds. 25 kids and about 5-6 of them were aggressive towards me, towards each other, threw chairs, toys. I constantly had to call the parents and the rules always changed on sending home. 
I've always made more money than my husband. Paid most bills with just my income but I don't make enough to cover all and we live paycheck to paycheck. 
When I went on unpaid maternity leave it was hard. But by the grace of God we made it. 
By 6weeks postpartum I was ready to go back to work. I looked for other work because of how rough it was. I got a job offer for a higher position, slightly more pay and less stressful but hours would be 2-10 wed - sun and no childcare. I had my worries with waking up with the baby throughout the night ( we formula feed) and getting up with the other kids in the morning. I need sleep too. 
My husband wanted me to take the position. He reassured me that he would step up and feed the baby at night and help with the kids and the house, make dinner get the kids bathed and to the bed because I work fulltime and he works part time. So I accepted the job offer and it's been about a month now. 
He has gotten up with the baby maybe 5 times not constantly. I even try to wake him and he tells me no. He always has a rough night or a headache and never gets up with the kids. He complains I don't help enough with the house, doesn't give the kids a bath so I give them one in the morning when I'm home, barely makes dinner, sometimes he just gives them waffles or cereal ( we made a menu that's every week that I buy for and he knows how to make), there's been several times I asked him not to let his daughter(12)  feed the baby or carry him around. (She's clumsy, doesn't feed the baby correctly, I'm afraid she won't support his head or pick him up correctly.)  And he's done it several times if not everyday when I'm not there. School is starting in a few days and I have to wake up and take them to school. 
He just lost his job because he got a second one and it was a conflict of interest. He's a hairstylist. He was getting hourly VS commission and now it's straight commission and he doesn't have a huge or even moderate clientele. He's always asking for us to be intimate with each other but i literally dont want to but give in because he gets upset if i say no and i dont want the problem. ( the last time he said he was going to divorce me when i refused) I'm just tired at this point. I'm tired of having to figure out the bills, the kids and the house.  I'm tired of the broken promises and lack of respect for my wishes. So I just want to split the bills. He pays for his car insurance, half our storage, half the gas, half the rent, half the internet and I'd pay for my car payment, my car insurance, my half for rent, gas, internet and storage. I just know he can't afford it. I'd be able to afford my half with a little left over but I know he'd have a hard time getting his half. I'm just so upset right now I just don't care. I just want help. 
So would I be an AH if I asked to split the bills?

80,1eo1wj2,AITA for asking to pay for Uber after being refused to be dropped off at our home,"Me and my wife went on a trip with one of her colleague and his husband on a trip recently. They wanted to take their car, because it was newer(had cruise and lane assist), compared to our beater. During the trip - at a waterfalls, we (me and my wife) decided to hike to the bottom of the falls. They started with us, but midway they decided, it was too hard for them and decided to return to the parking. While we were returning to the top, they called us and told that they were feeling hot and wanted to go back to the hotel. We agreed and decided to take an Uber to our next spot. Frankly, I expected them to wait because Ubers are costly in the place we were visiting and it ended up costing us close to $40. They said turning on AC would cost them gas, keep in mind that the gas cost would be shared. Finally, when returning from the trip, they decided to get food at a place (not takeout, they wanted to dine in, because they felt the food would get soggy/cold - the round trip from our place to the place is about 30 mins). We already packed our food before starting the return, so we didn't want to stop there, and i suggested they can drop us and comeback, since my wife had a night shift that day, and she would need to to sleep for a few hours. In response to that, they said it would cost them extra gas (which was shared), and we can wait for an hour in the car (since we didn't want to get food there), or take an Uber home from the restaurant. So, we chose the uber option which ended up costing us around $30 because of surge. So, after coming back, I sent out the expenses for the trip (how much they needed to pay us) and I included half of the uber cost from the restaurant to our place. They said it was our choice, that we didn't wait for them to finish, and they are not going to pay for that. We don't need the money, but it was about the principle.

82,1eo1en8,AITA for not trying everything to save my cat's life?,"My cat is 14 years old and has had kidney problems for the last 5 years or so for which he eats a special renal food. 

About 10 days ago, he started throwing up within minutes of eating (sometimes throwing up whilst still eating)

On Wednesday, I took him to the vet who did blood tests as the vet thought it was related to his kidney problems and he was given a shot to stop him throwing up and some special gastro food, they came back within normal parameters. The shot and gastro food did nothing and he continued throwing up.

Today we took him back to the vets as we were getting more concerned about him being dehydrated where they did an ultrasound and then an x-ray where they think they saw a mass in his oesophagus which would explain his symptoms and why he's throwing up. The vet said we'd need to refer him for a CT scan to confirm the mass was there which would be an extra £1200. 

I asked the vet the simple question. ""What would be the treatment options if the mass was confirmed"" - the vet said they could operate, but it would be very high risk but then at least we'd have a firm diagnosis. 

I said not to do the CT scan, he's an old cat now and even the CT scan is a lot to put him through as he'd have to be under a general to have it done and even if they confirmed the mass....the surgery to remove it would likely kill him anyway.

My partner thinks I'm being heartless and cold and I should be doing everything I can to save his life. I think the better option is palliative care and if through medication we can't help him to keep food down, or we see him getting vastly underweight or having other problems, then making the difficult decision is the best thing for him.

It's not a financial thing, he is insured so we're covered for everything after the first £200 which he's way over already.

AITA?

***UPDATE***

Thank you everyone for their insight, it was helpful. It's sometimes difficult to know you're doing the right thing and it was never about spending the money. I've had to have two cats put down in my life, I will never shy away from that decision if It's in the animal's best interest.

My partner apologised, saying she was just hurting because she was going to miss him and she didn't really think I was cold. She then started cooking chicken bones to make him cat soup because it would be easier for him to swallow

83,1eo1808,AITA for hanging out with my best friends brother more than her?,"I (22f) have a best friend(21f) who I have been friends with for about 3 years now. We became friends from working together and I have become part of her family. 

The problem starts a couple months ago. I started hanging out with her brother (25m) more often because she and I are on different schedules due to work, she’s also in schooling so her schedule has been packed. When I would try to schedule a hang out time, she was usually busy with work, school or spending time with her boyfriend. None of this bothered me as I’m not the type of friend that wants to be up my friends ass all the time. 

The other week she got mad at me, unadded me and left the family groupchat because ain’t added her back after she left once already without explaining. When I went to go ask if she was okay, she had unadded me off of everything social media platform so I couldn’t text her. 

Her reasoning behind it was that:
- we stopped hanging out/texting as often
- I see her family more than she does
- I started hanging out with her brother (who has a habit of sleeping with her friends) 
- that I had started seeing one of her brothers friends 

While I understand the reasonings I explained to her: 
- that she has so much stuff going on in her life that I just couldn’t always wait around for her to become available when I wasn’t. 
- I see her family so much because they have basically adopted me and live closer to me than my actual family
- her brother isn’t my type, and is basically like my older brother
- that this wasn’t something she could get mad at me for

We both apologized but it all went down hill this week again because I asked the family group chat about plans this weekend and tagged “the boys” of the group and not her (mind you she got pissed the last time) and she was mad that I didn’t tag her. Then she had originally invited me to bingo on Thursday (08AUG) and when I asked about if we were still going on Wednesday night(06AUG) she left me on read.

I asked our mutual friend, turns out they went without me and didn’t tell me. So now we aren’t talking again and I want to know if I’ve done anything wrong.

My mom has been looking after my children for 4 years. I got pregnant at 21 from my 28 year old ex and she never liked him but never tried hard enough to prevent me from being with him. She said I wouldn’t listen to her because I was still upset from the divorce (between her and my dad) and didn’t care what she said. I don’t think she did enough to protect me but that’s something we disagree on. He ended up being abusive and cheating on me with his now gf

I’m(26F) just upset that she is leaving my 4 and 2year old sons for my sister’s daughter. She says it’s only fair because she did 4 years of babysitting for me and it’s hard to find childcare for an under year old. She says I’m ungrateful and she hasn’t gotten a thank you for her free childcare. I think she is doing it to punish me and she is also doing it because my sister is paying her. She says it’s not about the money and she will give some of it to me to help me with childcare. But childcare for 2 kids is over $2000 and I only make $3200 after taxes. My ex only pays $300 for his kids and I her it’s impossible for me to make it without her but she insists it’s fair. It’s not fair my sister and her husband make a lot of money and they own their home. I’m in a shitty rented apartment. I feel like she is intensionally screwing me after she didn’t protect me into getting in a relationship and then pregnant by an asshole.

88,1eo03ex,AITA for assuming my daughter could have a 3rd plate?,"Throwaway because my sister knows my reddit and I don't want this causing drama

Yesterday, My sister hosted a family dinner at her house. It was one of those ""just because"" dinners, no special occasion. My sister is a great cook and she made tons of food for that one night. My daughter, was on her second plate by the end of the night. Once she finished she asked if she could get another one. I said yes. But my sister (her aunt) looked at her with a shocked expression and said ""Another plate?"". My daughter turned around and gave a somewhat un comfortable look.

My daughter is 16, and has 2 part time jobs to pay for some of her college tuition, so she usually doesn't eat until 7-8pm. So I didn't even blink twice when she got up to grab her 3rd plate.

I turned to my sister and said she's been working all day without anything to eat, you made tons of food, it won't hurt for her to get another plate. My sister started yelling saying something about how it wasn't my place to say if my daughter could get more of her food that she made. Now I do somewhat agree with that, and might be the A-hole because of that. Looking back I'm thinking maybe I should have asked? 

My daughter ended up not getting another plate, and the vibe was awkward now so we just decided to go. Before we left out the door my sister stopped me and told me I should've taught my daughter manners and how it isn't right to get more than 1 plate at someone else's house.

I told my sister she was being ridiculous and somehow our voices got loud enough where my mom started to hear us in the small corner, she came over and started telling me she agreed with my sister and it was rude for my daughter to eat that many plates. I started to get fed up when they began telling me I wasn't teaching her proper manners, so I left. Then of course they began texting my phone saying how it was rude to leave in the middle of our conversation. I don't think I was the A-hole at all for leaving because I wasn't going to stay in a place where I felt disrespected. But i'm not sure about the plate thing.

This pretty much used up the entire budget I had so I didn't get her much else, only some nice chocolates, flower and a nice bottle of wine.

When I gave her the gifts she thanked me but seemed annoyed. I asked what was up and she said that she thought I'd have gotten her a nice surprise. She pointed out the surprise she had gotten me and said she thought I might do something similar.

I asked if she only got me the surprise so that I'd get her one and she said no but it still hurts that I didn't bother to get her one.

I told her if she wanted surprising then she shouldn't have given me a list of things she wants and should have just left it to me to get her gifts. She mentioned that I'd asked for gifts and still gotten a surprise but I pointed out the items I asked for cost around £25 in total whereas the items she asked for cost over £100.

She just said that she thought I'd have put more thought into her gifts and I just told her she was acting ungrateful since she got everything she asked for.

They were together for years, had my brother (28m) and broke up when he was 8 but stayed married, just not living together, and neither filed for divorce. They ended up getting back together after a few years and had me (17f). But they were over for good by the time I was 1 and had finally filed for divorce. Both got into other relationships and the cheated on those other relationships with each other before finally settling into the marriages they're currently in.

I was 8 when my mom got married and 10 when my dad got married. Those relationships had started 2/3 years before the marriages.

My mom's husband had two kids when he met my mom, both younger than me. Together they had two more kids who are now 7 and 4 years old.

My dad's wife had three kids technically when they got married. One is her stepkid who sees her as her mom, the other two are her bio kids from the marriage with the stepkids father. Together they have a 5 year old and they have taken in his wife's 2 nephew's from her sibling who died and they adopted them.

There has been this tug of war between sides for as long as I can remember them being together. My brother noped out of it, and could, by the time it started. But I was stuck with it. My mom and dad wanted me to prefer their side, shoved their kids and stepkids down my throat so I'd have a stronger relationship with either side. They compete for me to show the most attention to their family. They make it into something crazy and way too complicated. Like I'm supposed to see dad's side as true siblings, even the non-bio ones and love them more than anything else according to my dad. And according to my mom it's her side I feel that way about.

They have always asked which siblings I prefer or they ask leading questions about which side I prefer where it's not directly asking me that but you know that's what it's about.

Two days ago we had this meeting with people from my school. It's my senior year and I have an IEP for school, for speech and reading. During the meeting they brought personal stuff into it and it spilled out more once we left. They directly asked me which siblings I prefer and who I'm the closest to. How do I really feel blah.

I am 22M, she’s 23F. I’ve been collecting high end watches for several years. It’s a hobby that I’m passionate abt, having invested lots of money into my collection.


2 days ago, we were at my apartment and I was in the bathroom. I came back to find her wearing one of my most expensive watches. She was on the couch and when she saw me all she asked  was how it looks on her.


I immediately got upset and angry and told her that she should’ve asked me before wearing it. She was somehow surprised? And asked why it was such a big deal.


To be fair, she knows close to nothing about watches and especially this brand (PP). So I tried explaining to her how valuable and delicate it is and that i like it to be handled carefully.


Then she got even more upset, questioning why I would spend that much money on a watch instead of investing it or saving it. She didnt know about my financial background to be able to afford this as we have only been dating for a month. She felt lied to, asking why I didn’t tell her this until now. 


Since then, there has been tension between us (irl and texting). I’m not sure what to think, AITA?


Edit: some points people keep asking:

I recently moved here from outside america - don’t have a safe, don’t have most of my watches with me


The watches are on a shelf in my bedroom in their boxes/cases

I was out in the city listening to music, using my noise cancelling headphones. As I approach the pedestrian crossing the light turns red.

The construction worker told me that the cyclist has the right of way, because it was a red light for me to cross, BUT, he also told the cyclist he could have slowed down. It didn't even occur to me, yes – he could have slowed down. Before I crossed the road I knew that there would be enough time for me to cross. But this beeping sound had started a little bit before we crashed, which meant that he had already started beeping a bit before we collided and he didn't slow down either, so he had plenty of time to react. Regardless, I stuck around, and repeatedly tried to apologies.

Now, I am young, obviously I have a lot to learn. However, he's a grown man, and has been for a while. I maturely apologised, but he did not act maturely.

It didn't even occur to me, yes – he could have slowed down. Before I crossed the road I knew that there would be enough time for me to cross. But this beeping sound had started a little bit before we crashed, which meant that he had already started beeping a bit before we collided and he didn't slow down either, so he had plenty of time to react. Regardless, I stuck around, and repeatedly tried to apologies. The construction worker got the attention of the cyclist and told him ""this gentlemen is trying to apologies and see if you're okay?"", to which he replied  ""if you want to die go out there and stand in front of a car"". Now, I am young, obviously I have a lot to learn. However, he's a grown man, and has been for a while. I maturely apologised, but he did not act maturely. I was shocked, the construction worker frowned at him and he just pat me on the shoulder and said thanks for your help. I completely understand this is my fault and I feel so guilty, but a little part of me wants to dislike this guy. Does anyone else feel this way?",1.0,1.0138758420944214,1,1
96,1enufjg,AITA for taking the whole box of condoms? ,"I 19f was at a house party at my friends bfs house 

My bf was picking me up when he got off work at 2 and staying at my house. 

I was talking to my friend about how I’m getting an IUD soon but for now we’re using condoms tho he’s always the one who buys them and I have none at my house and he didn’t bring any before he left for work so when we get to mine there’ll be some stuff off the table 

She says her boyfriend keeps some in the drawer next to his bed after asking him because he’s the one who bought them she gave me permission to go up there and take some before I left, I ended up taking the mostly full box without thinking about it. Also this might seem a little weird but I’ve been in his room before as she basically lives there and I’ve been over to hang out with her. 

Next day she texts me annoyed and it seems there was a miscommunication as she says she never said I could take the whole box as that’s ridiculous and while she isn’t that annoys apparently her boyfriend is. I immediately offered to give him a tenner next time I see him, she said they’re definitely more expensive than that but it’ll be fine. 

In my defence I genuinely in my head thought I could take them all and also I didn’t realise how expensive they where, I still don’t know the price but I couldn’t imagine they’d be a good bit more than £10, tho it’s a bit of a bigger box and they seem high quality like some good edition of a pretty good brand so idk.

97,1enu6c7,AITA for standing in the way of my best friend dating someone new ,"My (23f) best friend (24f) has recently broken up with her boyfriend of nearly 3 years. I fully supported her through the whole process, gave her advice when needed, was a shoulder to cry on multiple times and honestly kind of experienced the breakup with her in a way (not saying I was in their relationship, just that I got the ins and outs of everything that was happening). 

Since breaking up with her ex she has started seeing someone else a month later, she met the guy through work and has been friends with him for a while now so it’s not a new person in her life. It started out as hanging out here and there but she has now started seeing him nearly every night. I’m so happy for her because her ex treated her like shit but I’m worried that she’s not taking time for herself to really process what being single is like. She has told me previously that she develops co-dependency quite quickly and I’m worried that this is her new dependent in life. 

I’m moving out of the country really soon and not to sound selfish but part of me feels as though she’s needing to find someone to fill the physical gap that I’ll leave in her life. I know this because I’m finding it hard to come to terms with the fact she won’t be physically in my life. I’ll always be in her corner no matter what but I’m just so afraid that she’s rushing into this as a way to not be alone. I also know before her ex she was with someone for a couple of years too so part of me thinks maybe she’s just a relationship girl?

I know I don’t have a right to tell what she should and shouldn’t do with her life but I want to try find a way I can voice my concerns without it coming across as  parenting her in a way. She does keep telling me that it isn’t serious and they aren’t getting into a relationship anytime soon but something in my gut just tells me that I think she’s only saying this to me because she knows that I would voice my concerns. 

Upon looking back this might be more of a “will I be the asshole” but any advice would be greatly appreciated!

98,1entqsr,AITA for refusing to pay for a movie ticket my friends bought me,"Ok so, I recently watched the Deadpool and Wolverine movie and I loved it sm that I decided I wanted to watch it again. I asked on our group chat, as well as suggested a time to go on Monday. Just for the movie and maybe a meal before or after, instead of a whole day thing my friends usually plan. One person responded right away saying hell yea, but the others hadn’t seen it yet. 

I went to take a shower and when I got back, I checked the gc and they had all been messaging and planing a whole movie day and hang out, but they had a change of plans and decided to watch the new quiet place movie instead. One of my friends loves the series and hadn’t seen it yet, so she decided to suggested that movie instead. They picked a time around the original time I suggested for Deadpool and Wolverine. I told them not to buy me a ticket, but my friend said she had already bought the tickets for everyone, including me. The problem is, I’ve already seen this movie as well w my family, and it was good, but I’m not gonna waste my money on that over Deadpool and Wolverine. They also basically completely ignored my movie suggestion and when my friend suggested a quiet place instead, they all immediately agreed to that. 

I think its fine if they didn’t want to watch the movie I wanted to see, and made other plans instead, but I also think it was rude to not wait for my response and leave me out of the convo, yet still decide for me that I was going to pay and go. I told them I wasn’t going and I wasn’t going to pay for the ticket. My friends got mad at me for not paying, as the ticket was about 25$ and everyone else payed back via Venmo for theirs. I told them they shouldn’t have bought me a ticket without asking me first and just because they were changing the original plans I suggested, didn’t mean I was changing mine, and the extra ticket was on them. They can find someone else to go, like one of their siblings or something. 

I feel a little selfish and childish about being so annoyed that they changed my suggestion and left me out of the convo, and just assumed I’d be fine w anything even tho I asked if anyone wanted to go w me for the movie (not a whole day hang out as they ended up planning) for the SPECIFIC reason that I wanted to see a particular movie. I just thought since I wanted to go the movies, I’d invite my friends along w me. I’m just annoyed that I suggested something specific because I was gonna do it myself anyway, and they piggy backed off my idea to go see a movie that day and turn it into an entire day long hang out plan AND change the movie AND expect me to pay for their choice instead AND not even ask me before buying me the ticket, AND then getting angry when I said I wasn’t planning on seeing that movie or paying for it because I already had plans to watch another film.

100,1entl73,WIBTA Subleaser pays for new couch…,"In summary, I subleased my school apartment for the summer. The girl has a cat. She moved out yesterday, and upon inspection my couch is covered in yellow piss stains and smells of cat urine.

I have two cats, they have peed on my carpet at home, and once on my bed. I know how impossible it is to get the smell of cat urine out of anything- and this couch is very stuffed and fluffy so likely the pee has soaked deep into it. A steamer or carpet cleaner would not do much.

Is it fair, or okay, for me to ask her to pay for it? It’s gross, it’s smelly, I don’t want to sit on it or nap on it, and I know my own cats will keep peeing on it if it already smells like urine and another cats urine at that. 

It was $80 of FB Marketplace, and a brand new one (same thing) is $150. Having her pay that $80 would go a long way. 

I don’t like confrontation but I also don’t like piss soaked couches.

It got to the point where I had no food in the house, she knew and she was posting on instagram nights out and was telling me was broke and hadn’t been paid. 
Thankfully my partner helped me out that month and has been really supportive throughout this.

I checked and he was sick starting yesterday and passed today and she used his passing as an excuse over money that I only had only wanted back as a principal.

He had always been the one out of the two of us to have the higher sex drive.

Anytime we had sex he always had something to complain or feel insecure about. It was always that “I didn't look into it” or he could sense that the vibe was off. I would always reassure him that I enjoyed our sex. Every few months he would come to me and express that he was “not happy with me and our sex because we weren't doing it enough”.

103,1ent1h6,AITA for my reaction to my mom for telling me that my doctor said I'll be more beautiful when I lose weight?,"My mom (70f) and I (29f) go to the same primary physician. I've seen him before, but only a couple of times (my mom has for a few years). I went for a check-up recently and shared with him that I've been on my weight loss journey, losing 30lb since February. 

For context, I'm a size 16 now and have always been heavy. I've always tried but struggled to lose weight. From 2020-2021, I gained almost 50lb. Then I lost the 50lb by the end of 2022, but I fell off the wagon because I was depressed (not an excuse) and gained 40lb back. I've lost 30lb so far this year, and I'm doing better at it than ever before.

Also, I'm a first-generation American-Persian (my parents/the Dr are Persian). In my experience, Persian Drs are more casual w/ Persian patients (unfortunately).

My mom and I live together, so she obviously knows everything about me. I've always hated my weight. Growing up (Persian) made it even harder. I swear my outer family/family friends were worse to me than the bullies in school. So passive-aggressive about it and always seeing you as less of a person. Like you're the biggest eye sore in the room and simultaneously the most invisible. An inconvenience.

I also want to make it clear that my mom has become very supportive and compassionate with me about my weight. She used to make ignorant comments when I was younger, but she's gotten so much better, and I really appreciate it.

So today, my mom told me that yesterday, when she went to her appointment, the Dr asked if I'm her daughter (we have different last names). She said yes, and he said that I'm a beautiful young woman, and that ""it's good she's losing weight, she'll be more beautiful when she loses more."" My mom told me this like he was really complimenting me. She really believes that, and she was telling me with a smile on her face. As soon as she told me, I told her to please not tell me that he even said that in the first place. That I wish she'd kept that to herself. She ignored me & tried to continue the story, like there was nothing to be hurt about. I said I didn't want to hear the rest of the story and repeated what I'd said. She responded, ""Why not? It's a compliment. "" I said ""no it's not."" And she kept repeating that he was complimenting me, defending him. I said, ""Only older Persians like you guys think it's a compliment. It's a backhanded compliment. And even if he and you thought he was being nice, it's not to me, and you should know that and shouldn't have told me what he said"". She got frustrated and annoyed with me. Basically, that I was making something out of nothing.

What bothers me more isn't that she told me, but that she kept making me and my feelings wrong.

She, of course, hasn't apologized, and instead, we were both upset and ignored each other for a bit.

We love each other so much, but I don't understand why she always has to defend the person that makes these kinds of comments and treats me like I'm overly-sensitive or asking for a fight.

So, AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-09,"AITA for my reaction to my mom for telling me that my doctor said I'll be more beautiful when I lose weight? My mom (70f) and I (29f) go to the same primary physician. I've seen him before, but only a couple of times (my mom has for a few years). I went for a check-up recently and shared with him that I've been on my weight loss journey, losing 30lb since February. 

For context, I'm a size 16 now and have always been heavy. I've always tried but struggled to lose weight. From 2020-2021, I gained almost 50lb. Then I lost the 50lb by the end of 2022, but I fell off the wagon because I was depressed (not an excuse) and gained 40lb back.

104,1ensm7h,WIBTA if I remove a bridesmaid? ,"One of my close friends (Ashley, 28f) has been going through it the past few years. She is in a large amount of debt, has lost a lot of friends and has serious issues with drinking. 

Besides this I love her and have really been there for her… I’ve lent money, time, energy you name it. I genuinely just want to see her get back on her feet. 

In saying that - our lives have taken different directions in the past few years. I have a steady career, am engaged, bought a house with my fiance and settling down. 

In no means do I feel “better than”, but the energy between Ashley and I has been awkward at times and there have been a few instances she’s gotten angry at me when I’ve had moderate success. (Eg I bought a new car and she was really annoyed when she found out in passing conversation)

Recently, I’ve asked 6 friends to be in my bridal party. Ashley came over, got drunk, broke some items from the bridesmaid proposal box and then left it at my house. She had dramas happening with her family during the weekend when the girls had a sleepover and I honestly felt really deflated. She spent a lot of time also talking about how she can’t afford to contribute anything. I have offered to pay for everything but she won’t even be able to pay for transport or her portion of accomodation ($150 for the weekend) for my hens. 

I understand she has stuff shes working on, but I feel that for once, I just want the focus to be on me. For the past years I have been loyal to a fault and honestly, I was hurt she couldn’t return the same excitement. 

My fiance thinks I should politely ask Ashley to step down and attend as a guest, we’re worried she may get drunk the morning of the wedding or potentially be a liability. 

I feel very torn because I love her and want to include her. If I ask her this, it may also ruin our friendship or spiral her mental health. 

I’ve tried really hard to be understanding of her situation but to be honest, for once I want to be selfish and protect my peace. 

Would I be the asshole if I ask her to step down? :/

105,1enskyj,AITA for telling my husband no to getting lunch in the middle of the work day with my husband’s brother & in laws before he leaves for his final year of college? ,"In the last few hours, I (F 28) found out that my husband (M 30) made tentative lunch plans with his family and brother without asking me about my schedule for next Thursday. 

******EDITED FOR CLARITY******

I told my husband to go without me if that’s the day everyone is set on. I’m not mad about him going, just more of his expectation that I would drop everything to join the lunch during work. And he’s annoyed that I’ve said no, but my work takes priority and if this was planned for after work, then it would be more than doable. 

We are leaving for a wedding this weekend and returning home on Sunday. The plan (I thought) was to stop by my in laws house on the drive back and say goodbye to my husband’s brother before he leaves for his senior year of college a few days later on Thursday afternoon. 

We both work mostly remote jobs, and I have general working hours from 9-5ish or 10-6ish. The only time I am able to comfortably leave my desk is to go to my workout class for 1-1.5  hours right before the start of my day. 

My FIL texted my husband and said my BIL was depressed that he couldn’t see my husband before leaving, even though we were going to stop by to say goodbye on Sunday. My FIL told him that he realizes my husband is busy, but to try to accommodate. This upset me for a couple of reasons:

1) I got the impression that my FIL doesn’t care about my job schedule, and he doesn’t feel like it’s hard to accommodate such a request when in reality, meetings are generally scheduled more than a week out. And even if it’s not a meeting heavy day or week, there is still work to do (especially in my field of public health where it’s very research and writing focused). It seems like he only prioritized my husband’s schedule and I would just tag along/agree with everything. 

2) We see my husband’s family at least 1-2 times a month, and they live 30 minutes from us. Anything more than that I feel like I would get anxious, as I’m naturally more of an introvert and need time at home to reset my social battery, whether it’s family or friends. So for them to act like it’s not good enough for us to swing by the day after a wedding to come say goodbye on Sunday instead of  Thursday rubs me the wrong way.

I’m pretty upset about the lack of communication from my husband’s side. He went ahead and tentatively said let’s meet for lunch next Thursday right before his brother drives off to college, then caught me up with the plans. Any other time after work would be been fine. And now he’s annoyed at me because I can’t step out for lunch with his family during the work day on specifically a Thursday, which round trip would be at least 3-4 hours. It hurts me a lot because I always make sure to communicate with him before proposing or committing to plans with anyone. AITA?

106,1enshfi,AITA if I (22f) pretend to buy my “gf” (23f) an engagement ring?,"
So, this situation is super weird but I’d really appreciate some help. My bf (24m) wants to propose to me and we want to search for ring designs I might like. So exciting! The problem is that we are currently in a ldr and in different parts of the country. We are both in grad school and can only visit each other one weekend a month, not on weekdays when jewellery stores will be open. So, we cannot both simply go to a jewelry store together and ask about what might fit our budget etc. Either he goes alone or I go alone (we just want a rough idea of what can be gotten for our budget of $2k.. we don’t want to order the ring yet.. when it gets to that point, we will go together). 

But for now, it would be more useful if I go to the jewelry store since I’m the one who will be primarily designing the ring which I’ll wear forever. Here is the issue.. it looks really weird for me to go to the jeweler and design my own engagement ring.. it will make me look pathetic and my bf look like uncaring. So, I am wondering if I should go with my bff and pretend the ring is for her? She would be my “gf” and soon to be “fiancee.” We have basically the same ring size. 

I’m worried that I might be the AH since this plan seems unethical. My bff and I are both straight women and also suck at lying. We would be going to a small family owned jewelry store so the owners might make small talk and genuinely want to get to know us but we would be lying about everything. I would be interested in commissioning them if they’re in my budget, so I’m not exactly wasting their time.. but it still feels icky. 

Is this an unethical thing to do? AITA?

If so, do you have better ideas on how I should go about this? I’m really bad at lying on the spot, so I need a very believable explanation of why I’m at the jewelry store and be able to answer questions if they ask. Idk about telling the truth since I’m worried it sounds embarrassing and makes me and my bf look bad. Or do you disagree and think the truth is fine to tell if the jeweler asks who I’m shopping for?

107,1ensa5k,AITA for Asking My Husband to Buy a House in Our Name Instead of His Parents' Name?,"**UPDATE:**  
Thank you all for your thoughtful comments. After reflecting on your advice, I decided to have an open conversation with my husband about this. We both agreed that putting the house in his name makes sense since he is the one paying for it. Despite our joint income, his contributions towards our joint expenses and retirement funds will remain unchanged because of this investment. Additionally, having the property in his name offers me protection in case of any future issues.

I realize now that I was in a really bad state of mind when I initially posted. I love my husband deeply, and instead of addressing my concerns directly with him, I turned to Reddit to see if speaking up would make me look like the bad guy. Reading your comments made me understand the importance of clear communication, and I'm glad I chose to talk things through. Thanks for helping me find clarity and peace of mind.

Hi everyone,

I’m struggling with a situation involving my husband and his plans to buy a house, and I could use some outside perspectives. I’m wondering if I’m being unreasonable or if my concerns are valid.

Here’s the context: My husband and I both work and earn a decent income, but the cost of living in our current city is high. We’re currently paying over 40,000 rupees a month for a 2-bedroom flat. Meanwhile, his parents live in a different town with much lower rent. My husband wants to buy his first house, but he wants to purchase it in his hometown, in his mother’s name rather than ours.

He also intends for this house to eventually be our retirement home. He has also told me that although he is buying this house, when his parents are older, they will eventually move-in with us wherever we are staying. In that regard, buying a house in a city where we both are currently in makes much more sense. But the real-estate rate is much higher where we are staying, so he can't afford to buy it here.

I feel like I have no say in this decision, and it’s causing tension between us.

I’m worried about several things:

1. **Legal Rights**: If the house is bought in his mother’s name, will his siblings or cousin have any legal rights to the property in the future?
2. **Future Claims**: If his cousin or anyone else stays in this house for a long period and later has a family, could they potentially claim the property?
3. **Lack of Consultation**: My husband hasn’t really discussed this with me or considered my views on the matter. I am also worried that if I say the wrong thing, I might come out as a villain who doesn't like her in-laws. It feels like my opinion doesn’t matter, and I’m concerned about the long-term implications for us.

Am I the asshole for being uncomfortable with this plan and wanting the house to be purchased in our name instead? I feel like my husband is making a significant decision without including me, and I’m worried about the future ramifications, what if, I don't want to stay in his home-town after retirement?

108,1ens4yw,AITA: i stopped talking to my bsf bc of a road trip she went on w my ex,"I (21F) have a best friend, Mandy (22F) who I’ve known since preschool. We practically grew up together which is why this situation kinda hurts. One day Mandy and I were eating lunch together and she tells me that my ex Leon (23M) invited her and another friend Kenny (22M) to go on a road trip to Vegas with him. Leon and I had broken up a month prior. Mind you, Mandy was friends with Leon before I met him. She’s the one who set us up when we started dating. Kenny was also friends with Mandy before we all started hanging out together as a group. Mandy is the mutual friend between us all. Mandy tells me that she planned on going on the trip with the guys even though she was dreading it and making it sound like she didn’t want to go. Let me make it clear that I wasn’t jealous that I wasn’t invited. I’m more uncomfortable that Mandy was planning to go on this trip knowing that Leon and I ended on bad terms. Leon would constantly go to Mandy for advice about our relationship because he thought she knew me better. You would think that dating someone for 3 years meant they knew you well enough. I thought our friendship meant that consideration of my feelings were a given. I made my discomfort clear when I asked if she thought it would feel weird. She said no because they’re all friends and I left it at that. At the end of our lunch I even told her to have fun on the trip without any bitterness to my tone. 

Fast forward to the day of the trip. Mandy still goes and texts me throughout the day to keep me updated. My anger got the best of me and I texted Leon saying that the timing of this trip in regards to our breakup was disrespectful and putting our friends in the middle of it was just unnecessary. He argued back saying I was just jealous that I wasn’t invited. Later that day, Mandy texted me asking if I said something to Leon because his mood was off for the rest of the trip. I told the truth and told her what I said and why I said it. She then got upset with me saying I wasn’t allowed to be mad since I was given a heads up in advance about the trip and that I could have just asked her not to go. I’m never going to tell a friend what to do because if our friendship means as much as I think it does, I shouldn’t have to ask for the consideration. In any circumstance why would someone be comfortable with their best friend going on a road trip with their ex and only one other person?? Mandy said she would have come up with an excuse not to go if I had just asked. That was another thing that upset me. Why couldn’t you just say out of respect for your best friend, you don’t want to go. I knew she wouldn’t tell him the real reason if she chose not to go. 

Anyways, words have been exchanged since then and I’m not sure if I should let go of Mandy completely or just be friends from a distance. Either way it’s a lose lose situation because it won’t be the same with someone I’ve been close with since childhood. AITA?

In any circumstance why would someone be comfortable with their best friend going on a road trip with their ex and only one other person?? Mandy said she would have come up with an excuse not to go if I had just asked. That was another thing that upset me. Why couldn’t you just say out of respect for your best friend, you don’t want to go. I knew she wouldn’t tell him the real reason if she chose not to go. 

Anyways, words have been exchanged since then and I’m not sure if I should let go of Mandy completely or just be friends from a distance. Either way it’s a lose lose situation because it won’t be the same with someone I’ve been close with since childhood. AITA? ",1.0,1.049811840057373,1,1
109,1ens4de,AITA for not trusting my boyfriend ,"
Backstory: a little over a year ago my boyfriend cheated on me with one of his employees. He told me that he was leaving me for her and then took it back and acted like we were still together. He told me he was confused and didn’t know what he wanted. He wanted us to just take a break while HE continued to see this other girl and I was not allowed to see anyone. I was pregnant with our third child and making things work as a single mom of 2 was already going to be hard but now it would be 3 kids. The girl he was seeing found out about his situation and decided not to see him anymore. I ended up moving in with my mom across the country and eventually he decided to relocate, things got better for a while.  
Now: he’s working at the same restaurant concept in this state (hooters), he just transferred over. I feel like he should know that he needs to rebuild our trust but he just doesn’t understand. I try not to get jealous but I honestly just feel traumatized. He cheated on me with one of his employees so that’s my biggest trigger. Every time I say something he explodes and tells me I will never trust him.Today I went to pick him up from work and he was very late. The kids were screaming and very overtired. He told me he has to go buy tampons for the store. I asked if it could wait and he just exploded, he was so mad I asked. I really shocked by how upset he was, he slammed the door on me and went into a gas station to see if they had any. I was mostly concerned about the fact that we were already so far from home and all three kids were extremely upset but still in the back of my head it felt abnormal that he would be this angry. I told him it felt really suspicious. I asked him which employee it was and he refused to tell me. When he cheated on me with the other hooters girl he had refused to tell me her name as well (before I knew he was cheating) All I said to him after this was “oh okay I understand now” and just went quiet. He told me I was blowing things way out of proportion and I was just never going to trust him again. Eventually he did end up telling me her name. She’s extremely pretty and exactly his type. Recently, he’s been going out of his way to look nicer. I told him that I don’t think things are working out and he started calling me stupid for being jealous over an employee. I told him I feel hurt because of everything he did in the past and that I wished he wouldn’t get so defensive. I asked him to stop trying to make me feel dumb and he just kept saying I was. It hasn’t even been a full year since we officially got back together. and I feel like I deserve some time to build that trust back but he seems to think I’m being unreasonable. I don’t even know if I’m in the right here, am I being crazy? Am I the asshole here?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-09,"AITA for not trusting my boyfriend

112,1enqy74,"AITA? My housemate tried to guilt me into paying for repairs to his car after he let me borrow it and started having issues later, and I refused.","One of my housemates let me borrow his pickup truck to pick up a desk from a seller on FB marketplace. I drove the truck, along with one of our other housemates to pick up the desk. (The guy who lent the truck was busy and either couldn’t go or didn’t want to go but opted to lend us the truck in lieu of going with me himself.) We went and picked up the desk, and I used the parking brake to park like I always do, regardless of whether I’m parking on an incline. That’s how I was taught how to drive, and I’ve never done it any differently regardless of what car I’m driving.

Later that evening, he told me that the rear driver-side wheel of his car had started making weird noises and was dragging slightly, an issue I didn’t notice, and that he said he’d never had before. He mentioned that he saw I had engaged the parking brake when I got out of the truck to unload the desk. I didn’t respond, because I knew he was going to try to blame me.

The next day, he texted me while I was on the way home to my parents’ house for the night to celebrate my birthday with them. He said his truck was in for repairs because of the issues he’d described the day before. He said that “if the issue was caused by the parking brake,” he would “appreciate it” if I would help pay for the repairs. I called him, and gently asked him to share his thought process that led him to conclude that I am responsible for paying for the repairs. Long story short, he claimed that I was responsible because I was the one who used the parking brake.

He then proceeded to compare this incident to a bridge toll. He said: “If I lent the truck to \[my friend\], and he drove across a toll bridge, should he pay for that when I get the bill in the mail?” I said: “Of course!” He then asked why I shouldn’t pay for the repairs if I think his friend should pay for a bridge toll, to which I pointed out the blatant false equivalency. The conversation went around in circles, and I eventually had enough of him raising his voice at me and I hung up the phone.

Today, he called me again and told me that he had heard back from the mechanic today, and the mechanic told him that the issue had in fact been caused by the parking brake being engaged, and that his parents were going to have to take over $1,000 out of their savings to fix the issue. I said I didn’t want to re-hash the conversation, but that I still disagreed with his assessment of my being liable, and that I didn’t have extra money to give him regardless. He said he understood and offered to have me pay him a little bit each month. I said, “As I said, I don’t have extra money to give you, but even if I did, I don’t agree with you that I’m responsible for this, so my answer is no, and I will not discuss this again.” He exhaled sharply, and said: “Okay, man,” and hung up the phone.

116,1enq4hl,"AITA for confirming then cancelling my attendance for my friend's party, and then calling them a gaslighter?","So my best friend Marisa (29F) was planning a belated birthday party for my (28 f) friend Theo (26 M), and this was an out-of-town party at a camping site. She sent out the invites two months in advance because she needed to book the space and tents ASAP, but said there was an option to drive in for the day, no reservation needed. I didn't really want to participate in the camping, but I agreed to come in for the day. I don't drive, but two of our mutual friends had vehicles and also said yes to just coming for the day, so I figured I would coordinate with one of them closer to the date. 

A couple of weeks before the party, I found out my father wanted to celebrate his birthday on the same date (it was actually the weekend of his birthday, whereas for Theo, it was over a month after). My family birthdays are typically planned no earlier than 2 weeks ahead, so there was no way of knowing two months prior. Another notable thing: there are some health issues in my family. I have a cousin who is terminally ill with cancer, and my dad himself has chronic health issues, so obviously I am prioritizing my family at any given moment; and Marisa is aware of everything that has been going on. 

So I wrote in our group chat that I could no longer make it, apologized, and briefly explained why. On top of that, the two friends who drove also canceled for their own personal reasons, so even if my family party was not an issue, I would have no way of getting there. Marisa kept probing me and asking why I cannot come, when I had already explained, so I elaborated in more detail. Then she went on a rant saying how it really sucks when people cancel, and how she made this party two months in advance...etc...I was becoming really frustrated because I felt she was acting really unempathetically to my family's situation and only thinking of herself. (Also, since I was not camping, my attendance or lack of had no effect on the reservation or money spent  for booking). 

I told her that I can sympathize that it sucks when people cancel on your parties, and that it even happened to me. In fact, I reminded her she missed my actual birthday because she booked a trip the same day.

Am I overreacting? Thank you for taking the time to read this. ",Asshole,2024-08-09,"AITA for confirming then cancelling my attendance for my friend's party, and then calling them a gaslighter? So my best friend Marisa (29F) was planning a belated birthday party for my (28 f) friend Theo (26 M), and this was an out-of-town party at a camping site. She sent out the invites two months in advance because she needed to book the space and tents ASAP, but said there was an option to drive in for the day, no reservation needed. I didn't really want to participate in the camping, but I agreed to come in for the day. I don't drive, but two of our mutual friends had vehicles and also said yes to just coming for the day, so I figured I would coordinate with one of them closer to the date. 

A couple of weeks before the party, I found out my father wanted to celebrate his birthday on the same date (it was actually the weekend of his birthday, whereas for Theo, it was over a month after). My family birthdays are typically planned no earlier than 2 weeks ahead, so there was no way of knowing two months prior. Another notable thing: there are some health issues in my family. I have a cousin who is terminally ill with cancer, and my dad himself has chronic health issues, so obviously I am prioritizing my family at any given moment; and Marisa is aware of everything that has been going on. 

So I wrote in our group chat that I could no longer make it, apologized, and briefly explained why. On top of that, the two friends who drove also canceled for their own personal reasons, so even if my family party was not an issue, I would have no way of getting there. Marisa kept probing me and asking why I cannot come, when I had already explained, so I elaborated in more detail. Then she went on a rant saying how it really sucks when people cancel, and how she made this party two months in advance...etc...I was becoming really frustrated because I felt she was acting really unempathetically to my family's situation and only thinking of herself. (Also, since I was not camping, my attendance or lack of had no effect on the reservation or money spent  for booking). 

I told her that I can sympathize that it sucks when people cancel on your parties, and that it even happened to me. In fact, I reminded her she missed my actual birthday because she booked a trip the same day. I told her that I felt it was unfair that she is exploding on me when she more or less did almost the same thing to me, and I was cool with it at the time, and that it's not fair that she holds herself to a different standard than others.

I said it was one of my main interests right now, and that if I couldnt talk about sam and max anymore they couldn’t talk about stardew valley anymore. they got super upset, and hung up on me. later, they texted me and said that they wanted to break up because were just “too different” We’ve been dating for more than two years, and i really dont want to break up over something so petty. AITA for continuing to talk about Sam and Max? is there anything i could do to make it up to her?? Sorry if this is poorly formatted, this happened like an hour ago and im still upset.

121,1enogh9,AITA for asking my friend to help pay for our roadtrip?,"So I (25m) have been planning a roadtrip from Michigan to Colorado, which will be in the spring. The entire time I’ve been planning it, I’ve been planning on going alone, and just bringing my dog with me. I got the cheapest rooms in the motels on a the drive there, so the double full beds, but a king bed for my Colorado room. Three days driving there, 4 full days in Colorado, and 3 days back. While in Colorado, I plan on hiking various trails and just enjoying nature. 

I was texting a friend about it, and she (23f) asked if she could join me. She doesn’t have a drivers license but the (human) company on the drive would be nice. I said we should make plans to talk details, so we went out for coffee the next week. 

She started talking about things she wanted to do, none of which lined up with what I told her I was doing. 

I brought up the financial aspect of it, and this is where things took a turn. I got a deal on the king room at a nicer hotel in Colorado, so switching to a double queen room would actually cost $100 more total for the 4 nights. I asked her to cover that difference. I also asked that she pay for 2 tanks of gas, when I am anticipating to go through 9 tanks on this trip. Not that I need the money, but she’s essentially using me as a taxi to take her to Colorado so she can do her own thing. I also explained that she’ll have to buy her own food. 

She said she didn’t realize how money hungry I am, and that I’m being inconsiderate of her situation because I know she doesn’t have a job. The trip is over 7 months away, I told her she has plenty of time to get a job and get money saved up for the trip. She said most people over buy food for road trips, so she’ll be fine to eat whatever food I buy. I told her that was not an option. While I don’t mind sharing some food, I can’t have her relying on me for food for more than half the trip. Plus, I think paying for 2 tanks of gas in a 2,600+ mile trip that she wouldn’t be able to take by herself is hardly unreasonable. When I said this, she called me an asshole for bringing up that she doesn’t have a drivers license, and stormed out. Except that I never brought that up, all I said was that she couldn’t take the trip alone, meaning because of the financial needs and her lack of income.

I texted her and apologized for the drivers license thing, and explained that it’s not what I meant. I also told her that I will be taking the trip alone, since we clearly have different ideas of what we want the trip to be. 

Her response boils down to that I should have never invited her if it was just to have her help fund my trip. I just sent her back a screenshot of the text from her asking to join me, me thinking she was joking, and her insisting that she really wants to go. AITA for asking her to pay?

126,1enmpqf,AITA for planning a group trip and becoming unresponsive,"I (22F) recently went on a group acid trip with four friends: Jay (20F), Penelope (22F), Marcus (22F), and PT (23M). We rented an Airbnb for the weekend. It was the first time for Jay and Marcus.
Some background: I've known Penelope for four years. Jay is a girl I've recently started datingl. Marcus used to be Penelope’s roommate. PT is Marcus’s boyfriend. 
Jay and I have been getting closer, and this trip was kind of a way for her to meet my friends better. We hadn't defined our relationship yet.
The trip started off well, with everyone in good spirits. We were all talking and laughing.
Once outside, Marcus started complaining about the weather and making snide comments about PT. She kept saying things like, ""This is so boring, PT. Can't you think of anything fun to do?"" and ""God, you're so embarrassing when you're high."" PT seemed hurt by her comments but didn't say much in response. The negativity was starting to affect everyone.
Penelope seemed to be having a hard time and went back inside. Not wanting to intrude, I stayed outside. 
At this point, I started to really feel the effects of the acid. I became unresponsive and wasn't aware of what was happening around me.
What I didn't realize was that a lot of drama unfolded while I was in this state. Apparently, Penelope came back outside and saw the group dynamic had shifted. The combination of Marcus’s negativity, the intensity of the trip, and some personal issues she was dealing with triggered a bad trip for her.
Penelope called her family which made Jay nervous, and she concerned that Penelope’s family might call the police.
This led to a fight between Jay and Penelope. Jay became worried about the authorities. Penelope, on the other hand, felt offended that Jay would assume her family would call the police.
Meanwhile, Marcus and PT’s relationship issues seemed to escalate. Marcus kept picking fights with PT, accusing him of not paying enough attention to her. At one point, Marcus had a panic attack in the bathroom.
I also cuddled with Jay and accidentally told her I was in love with her.
I later learned that Penelope was crying and she felt like everyone treats her differently.
The rest of the trip was tense, though I was unaware of it at the time. Penelope continued to have a bad trip, talking about feeling like she'd lost a part of herself. Marcus and PT’s arguing continued on and off, with Marcus at one point accusing PT of taking my side in a conflict I didn't even know was happening.
After the trip, I felt terrible that Penelope had such a bad experience, and that Marcus and PT’s relationship issues were exacerbated during the trip. But I also feel like I didn't do anything wrong intentionally. I feel guilty for being so unresponsive and unaware of the conflicts happening around me. Marcus now said she hates me and thinks I was faking my high.

The thing is, he says it loud enough that the person who is leaving can still hear him.



At first, I thought it was just a quirk of his, but it started to feel condescending. We're all in our mid-twenties, and being called ""kid"" feels a bit patronizing. It almost seems like Kyle is making fun of the person leaving, like he's trying to get the last word in or assert some kind of superiority.

I suggested that he might want to stop doing it, especially since we're all adults here. Kyle seemed surprised and a little defensive, saying it's just a harmless phrase and that he didn't mean anything by it. He said I was being too sensitive and that I should just let it go.

So last year I (29f) was fired from a job after making a stupid mistake with the rota.

Anyway to get away wanting to be left alone, I was extremely upset from what happened and wanted to get away from my family as well, my mum kept saying things about how badly I messed up which was true but made no acknowledgment of the fact that my boss had never even contacted me to tell me I had been fired. Instead it was only when I texted him he told me over text. The way she was talking sounded like she was defending him and I just wanted to get away and be left alone. 

I knew I messed up badly. I made a stupid mistake when asking for time off and miscalculated dates. She was talking like I did it intentionally. I know she was just concerned and that’s where her behaviour was coming from. But I’ve seen it more with her in recent years, she has a desire to always be right. She was saying loads of things about getting another job etc which all ended up to be wrong. 

I flew to London to attend an interview for a seasonal job I had arranged earlier that year. I went away both for the interview and just to get away for a while. 

When I got back my younger brother 26 kept on harping at me, I knew he was copying exactly what my mother must have been saying about me when I was gone. He was saying the seasonal job was to compensate the one I’d just lost. That was never the intention. I was looking for a new job pretty immediately after finding out. 

My head was a mess the few weeks after being fired, until things got back on track when I got another job which is also better. 

He also took a dig at me for not inviting him when I went away. And to this day still does so in the odd time. “You went away to London without asking anyone.” He was just upset he didn’t get to go. I argue back at him every time I was going through one of the worst periods in my life and needed to be left alone. We’re in Ireland, London is not far away. If he wants to go there that badly go in his own time. I had a lot going through my head, he’s selfish to think I would be concerned about asking him to come away when my mind was elsewhere.

Not everyone got a say in what the food choices were going to be, the meal plan was decided by 3 people",Not the A-hole,2024-08-09,"AITA for bringing my own food on a group camping trip? Everybody spent 300+ dollars on the camping trip on a private island with animals roaming around and we all split on the food bill. 

The meals were thought out ahead of time. 

I do not like frozen hamburger options presented and offered to prep fresh hamburger patties for the trip but the ""leaders"" of the group elected for the frozen from the box type 

One side said it's more convenient for the frozen 

I said it's the same convenience if they are premade the night before. 

They have had my burgers before and they claim to like them. 

I'm not paying 300+ bucks to go camping and eat shifty food. I also substituted hotdogs for sausages for myself because I do not like hot dogs. AITA?


Edit: the camping trip is only 3 days long.
