0,1enpppl,AITA for avoiding my godmother because of her daughter?,"(TERF = Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist)

My godmother and her family have been friends with my family for years. My dad met my godfather before he met my mom, and I cannot think of a memory where they havenâ€™t been present in my life. My mom isnâ€™t a big fan of the family, but I really liked them, they are eccentric and kind of weird, which is something I found really refreshing and comforting. I (27 NB) was especially close with my godsister (32 F) who I formed a somewhat of a cousin-like bond with. She loves reading and is an excellent writer, and has even published her own book. I really enjoyed her company and saw her as someone I could look up to. Until now.

Sometime in late 2022, I was scrolling through tumblr  and I came across something troubling on my dash. It was a post that had heavy undertones of transphobia. I was shocked and confused, as I know I didnâ€™t follow anyone who had that kind of ideology. When I looked at who reblogged the post, I was even more shocked to find out that it was from my godsister. Confused and worried, I went through her tumblr, and since she tags everything I was able to find more of these posts. Somehow, I had never seen any of these posts of my dash, but here they were, ranging from posts that were aggressively transphobic, discrediting nonbinary as a gender identity, and the icing on the cake, praising JK Rowling like she were the next messiah. I canâ€™t properly express the horror, anger and sadness I felt when I saw these posts on her blog. This was someone I trusted for YEARS, someone I confided in and someone I even looked up to. I am nonbinary, and many it not most of my friends are trans and genderqueer. I even told her this before I found out about her posts, and she didnâ€™t even react to this news.

Because of this, I decided to cut off all contact with herâ€”I donâ€™t waste my time with TERFs. However, because of this decision, I have since been avoiding going to any parties or social gatherings my godmother has hosted at her home, because without a doubt my godsister would be there. My family things that I am overblowing this out of proportion, but Iâ€™ve tried to explain that)her ideology is extremely harmful and dangerous and as someone who is nonbinary, I feel extremely uncomfortable being around her. However, my folks are old school and donâ€™t understand (and donâ€™t really care) about my concerns, and even my brother  told me that I should just suck it up and stop avoiding my godsister. I donâ€™t want to keep avoiding my godmother, as she has been an incredible help to me and my family for years, but putting myself in a situation where thing could not only get awkward but confrontational is really upsetting to me. Just a couple of days ago my godmother invited me to my godfatherâ€™s birthday party, and I feel so guilty for turning down her offer.
