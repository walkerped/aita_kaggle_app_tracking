0,1eot749,AITA for deadnaming my friend?,"So I (F,15) have a friend (16) whom ive known for about six years now. We recently got in touch again after having lost contact because I moved away. He is trans, ftm. I know that he is because he has introduced himself to as a boy to all of my friends I've introduced him to and refers to himself with masculine words and pronouns. He's even talked about the struggles of being trans in a family in which those kinds of things are viewed as something bad. However, he has not yet come out to me. And I don't know why. I have plenty other trans friends and I respect their pronouns and identities, so I would hope it's not that he thinks I'm transphobic. My other theory is that maybe since we've known each other for so long he thinks it would be awkward if he suddenly came out to me? I've thought about asking him about it myself, but I feel like it's not something I can force him to tell me. In the meantime I use feminine pronouns and his deadname for him, (I'm using his chosen pronouns here out of respect) until he tells me something, and while I try my best to use non-gendered words when referring to him, (we talk spanish, which has no gender neutral pronouns) I still feel bad for misgendering and deadnaming him. So AITA?

EDIT: I feel like I should mention this before having more people call me transphobic. Last year the friend in question was talking about about a mutual friend of ours, who is also trans, about how difficult it is to be trans in a household that doesn't respect trans people. I was with them at the moment, though not taking part in the conversation because I'm not trans and I didn't think I could say anything valuable at the time. When they were done talking, my friend told me that he'd tell me what that all was about some day, which I assumed meant he would tell me officially hes trans once he was ready to have that conversation. That's why I don't use masculine pronouns with him irl, I'm waiting for him to be ready to tell me because I feel like thats important to him.

1,1eog22x,AITA regarding my parents?,"For the past 2 or 3 years now my relationship with my parents has been on a steady decline.

I (18) (still in high school) am living with my parents (both 50) in a small mining town in Serbia. 

I am bisexual and a furry, which in a small town, especially in Serbia is something that can get you beaten up very easily. Every day I have to hide these facts from pretty much everyone (including my parents) (there's very few people who know these things) I know since most people would stop liking me. 

I've been suffering from depression and anxiety problems due to my parents, homophobia and having to suffer guilt of who I was before (an extremely hateful and arrogant person). 

My parents are very homophobic, racist and generally bigoted, even though they always claim that they are tolerant towards queer people. Both of my siblings (sister and FTM brother) have cut ties with my parents due to them being awful towards them. 

A few years ago I started talking to my brother again and 
I feel like me wanting to talk to him has triggered my parents' hate towards me. They've been constantly comparing me to him, saying that I'm ""acting just like him"" and that I'm ""going to cut them off after moving out"". They snap at me a lot whenever I call him by his correct pronouns and name. 
I want to change my name a lot since my legal one is really traumatic for me. 

At one point I was hiding my depression from them cause I knew they were going to have a negative reaction (even though my dad is bipolar and mom has depression) and after I almost had a breakdown I snapped and told them that I've had depressive thoughts for a while. The reaction was extremely negative, along with my own dad making depression jokes about me a lot (still does it). 

I've had to limit my contact with my brother due to my parents and it was really hard for me to tell him that. My parents are constantly delusional that my brother is in the same small town, and they've been saying that I'm out with him, even though I've started to hang out with really cool and accepting people recently.

I feel as if all of this was my fault, and that if I never established contact with my brother, never changed as a person and stayed the dickhead I was before, everything would've been fine. I feel like all of the stuff happening to me is a punishment for me being the way I was before and I feel like I'm in the wrong and not my parents.

Another thing that I should note is that I've been closing myself off from my parents due to their hatred, which I feel as if it's making it worse, but at the same time anything I say or do makes me the same as my brother to them and if I don't say anything I'm still acting as my brother.

To any reddit reading channels that post on shorts / reels and etc. I BEG YOU not to use this post, cause I'm really afraid of my parents seeing it.

3,1ep6q7v,AITA for not allowing my adopted son to choose the movie on family movie night?,"I (45M) have four sons: three biological (17M, 15M, 12M) and one adopted (13M). We adopted Jake, our youngest, when he was 3 years old. He came from a really difficult background, and we’ve always tried to give him as much love and support as possible. But if I’m being honest, it hasn’t been easy.

Jake has always been more of a challenge compared to my other boys. He’s extremely sensitive and gets upset over the smallest things. Due to the trauma he experienced early on, Jake is mentally and emotionally more like an 8- or 9-year-old, even though he’s 13. This isn’t because of any special needs; it’s just the result of what he’s been through. When he was younger, he struggled a lot in school, to the point where he was eventually expelled from his primary school for behavioural issues. It was a really tough time for our family. We ended up enrolling him in a SEMH (Social, Emotional, and Mental Health) school, which costs around £70k per year. While the school has helped him somewhat, Jake still causes a lot of problems. The school often calls us because Jake’s had a meltdown or couldn’t handle something, and it’s clear he needs a lot more attention than our other kids.

At home, Jake’s neediness can be overwhelming. He’s constantly seeking reassurance and gets upset if things don’t go exactly his way. My wife has always been very patient with him, maybe too patient, in my opinion. She tends to cater to his needs a lot more than the other boys, and I can see it’s starting to wear on them. I can tell they’re starting to feel like Jake gets special treatment.

Earlier today, during our usual Saturday family movie night, this issue came to a head. We always vote on the movie to keep things fair. The older boys and I wanted to watch the first Avengers movie. When we voted, Jake was the only one who wanted to watch Spider-Verse instead. Jake loves Spider-Verse, and we’ve watched it several times before.

Seeing how upset Jake was getting, my wife suggested that we just watch Spider-Verse to avoid a meltdown. She felt it wasn’t worth the fight and wanted to keep the peace, especially considering how sensitive Jake is. But I felt like it wasn’t fair to the other boys who had won the vote fairly. I said no, we’re sticking to the movie that won the vote. Jake, predictably, got really upset, stormed off to his room, and refused to come back downstairs.

After the movie, my wife and I had a huge argument. She said I was being too ""harsh"" and that I don’t understand how difficult things are for Jake because of his past. She thinks I should have just let him have his way to avoid the conflict, but I’m tired of walking on eggshells and constantly giving in to Jake at the expense of the other boys.  I don’t think it’s right to let Jake dictate everything just because he’s more sensitive.

4,1ep6oh4,AITA for telling my brother I think his gf is lying about her past?,"I'm really overly protective of my brother, I just really worry about him and want him to find happiness.

I was the reason he got with his current gf. I live with my brother and I'd post snapchats of him all the time because we're really close. She reached out to me and asked for his social media, he doesn't have any, so I gave her his number.

They ended up chatting and getting along great, which I'm really happy about. It is really obvious to me that she is extremely into him.

I'm only worry about one thing, they have way too many things in common.

My brothers best friend passed away when he was 19 in a car accident. It obviously hurt him a lot and it took a long time for him to be OK after that. His gf's best friend also passed away around the same age. Not in the exact same way, but still a huge coincidence.

Our parents are abusive and our dad passed away years ago. My bro's gf's family was also abusive and her dad also passed away when she was young.

We were all hanging out in the living room and chatting when brothers gf mentioned that she had never seen him cry before. I said it was the same for me, and she was surprised at that because we were so close. She asked him when he last cried and he said it's been awhile. He said, ""I don't want to bring you down, but I use to get abused when I cried as a kid. So I just learned to never cry in front of people, to never give them the satisfaction.""

It broke my heart. And his gf was saying she was sorry about that, but she hopes he'll one day trust her enough and feel safe. But then she said, ""I don't know if I mentioned this, but my parents would abuse me for that, too, so I get you.""

I literally had to stop myself from rolling my eyes when she said that. There is just no fucking way. Did they live the exact same life?

I went home and was scrolling on gf's instagram page to see if I could back up the stuff she said. But I found nothing except a post from years ago where she said ""she faked likings bands for her crush.""

I was like, fuck, if she faked liking bands, what else can she fake? So I talked to my brother about it and he said I was way too paranoid, he said it was a big coincidence and that she wouldn't lie about something that big just because she lied about the band thing. I do feel bad for talking to him. AITA for doubting? Or is it fair?

This is partially because we are very different and partially because she doesn't approve of my marriage (my husband is 12 years older than me and we started dating when I was 18).
My husband and his family don't like my sister because she is openly feminist and doesn't care about gender norms in marriage.

Now, the problem : We hosted a birthday party for my son a few days ago, I had a headache so I was upstairs when I heard my MIL and husband arguing inside. He stormed in our room, said that MIL says that my sister called my SIL a whore, said that she is ugly and fat and then left. 
I said that my sister haven't said that, because she would never called another woman those type of derogatory words and husband said that MIL was there and heard everything and I wasn't, to which I said that than MIL is lying and that would be out of character for my sister to say something like that. 
He called me an a-hole and says that I don't even like my sister and that I get along better with MIL anyway, so how I can call her a liar?

He has been on the phone with MIL and SIL whole day and I have been made to be this huge jerk. 

Reason why I said that is that those type of words sound like something that my SIL and MIL would use, not my sister. 

Later, I talked with sister and she says that she was helping put together a swing in backyard when SIL said that she is again in men business and that she should be helping with food, to which my sister told her to f off already, took her keys and left with her husband.

6,1ep61p4,AITA for asking for gas money,"Little bit of history here first, I am not good with money. I have ADHD and have always had problems with handling money and even needed some significant bailouts in the past from my dad.

I am now married for almost 2 decades and in my 40s. I still don't manage money well. For fairness, I did spend a long time taking my husband for granted on the money front. Eventually we hit a rocky point and he put me on an allowance (which I agreed to). If I wanted extra spending money, I had to get a job. I was in school at the time, so it was fine.

I graduated. Had a rough time getting employed, but eventually I did in Oct 2022. I left my job in May 2024 because of stress and other reasons. Since then I have been actively looking for work and making myself more employable with creating work portfolios and similar. 

I haven't gone out a lot except for two reasons- to take my dogs to PetSmart and Petco to walk them and at times pick up supplies for them (agreed upon with my husband). The other is to volunteer with a service dog organization. Admittedly this organization is not close and sometimes i volunteer to drive dogs to other locations up to 4 hours away.

He has been helping me with my expenses around $1000/mo. However, we never went over what my expenses were. Nor did we discuss an allowance this time.

I have been trying to be super sensitive about not asking for money for things like clothes or on-going subscriptions. In fact, I got rid of those services when I left my job except Amazon which is both of us.

Last weekend he gave me money and I paid my bills and it left around $30 in my account. I told him at the time and thought nothing of it. 

Over the week I mentioned volunteering today and that I would be gone. He said he had to do something for work the same morning. 

Now when it came time to leave I noticed I was going to need gas. I asked him for gas money and he said ""no."" When I asked why, he said it was a frivolous expense and that I should have thought about that and that if I want to go out I should get a job. Then said at this point I should settle for any job. 

Now he handles all of our bills and we are not in any sort of financial hardship. We can't go on a cruise or anything, but we are not on the verge of collapse.

Also he does not go out anywhere, ever. The only time he goes out is with my family about once a month. The rest of the time he is either at home or work. He also doesn't buy a lot of stuff either. He is super practical.

I cannot live like that though. I need to go out and. I figured volunteering would be an ok thing. I limit to once/mo and that's it. The rest of the time I am at the house or maybe at PetSmart or Petco. 

Some may ask ""well how do you not have gas?"" Well because we never went over my expenses together and that we just cover my debt. Also the last time I bought gas was about a month ago.

Also he does not go out anywhere, ever. The only time he goes out is with my family about once a month. The rest of the time he is either at home or work. He also doesn't buy a lot of stuff either. He is super practical.

I cannot live like that though. I need to go out and. I figured volunteering would be an ok thing. I limit to once/mo and that's it. The rest of the time I am at the house or maybe at PetSmart or Petco. 

Some may ask ""well how do you not have gas?"" Well because we never went over my expenses together and that we just cover my debt. Also the last time I bought gas was about a month ago.

7,1ep6095,AITA for ditching my friend's stag do because I thought it was going to be boring?,"So, one of my closest mates, Tom (29M), is getting married soon, and he planned this big stag do. We’ve been mates since uni, so I was obviously invited. The thing is, Tom’s never been much of a party guy. He’s more into hiking, board games, and all that stuff, which is fine, but it’s not really my scene.

When he sent out the itinerary, I realised it was going to be a weekend of pretty tame activities – a hike in the morning, a brewery tour, some pub quizzes, and a quiet dinner. No clubs, no big night out, just super chill stuff. I figured it was going to be a bit dull, to be honest.

Meanwhile, another mate of mine invited me to a proper wild weekend in Ibiza. We’re talking beach parties, clubbing, and just an all-out mad time. It’s the kind of thing I’m really into, and it’s been ages since I’ve let loose like that. So, I made a last-minute decision to bail on Tom’s stag do and go to Ibiza instead. I figured Tom would understand since we’re close, and honestly, I didn’t think it would be a big deal because he had loads of other mates there.

When I got back, I found out Tom was really upset. Apparently, he felt like I’d abandoned him on his big weekend and that I wasn’t there to celebrate this important moment in his life. A few of our mutual friends are also giving me the cold shoulder now, saying I was being selfish.

I feel like it was my choice how I wanted to spend my weekend, and I didn’t want to be bored out of my mind. But now I’m starting to wonder if I should’ve sucked it up and gone to Tom’s stag do, even if it wasn’t my idea of fun.

8,1ep5vcz,AITA for grounding my son for refusing to share his birthday money with his brothers?,"So, here’s the situation. My oldest son (10M) just had his birthday last week, and he got a decent amount of money from relatives—about £150. He was really excited about it and immediately started talking about all the things he wanted to buy. 

Now, we’ve got two younger boys (8 and 5), and they’re at that age where they get really jealous when one of them gets something the others don’t. So, I suggested to my oldest that he should share some of his birthday money with his brothers. Not all of it, but like, £20 each, just so they could get something small too.

My son got really upset and said it was his birthday money and he shouldn’t have to share it. I told him that as the oldest, he should set an example for his brothers and that it’s important to be generous. He still refused, so I ended up grounding him for a week for being selfish.

My wife thinks I overreacted and that it’s not fair to expect him to share his birthday money, especially since it’s something he’s been looking forward to. She says I’m teaching him the wrong lesson and that it’s okay for him to have something that’s just his.

I feel like I’m just trying to teach him to be considerate and not get too caught up in material things, but now everyone’s upset. My son is sulking, my wife is annoyed with me, and I’m starting to wonder if maybe I handled this wrong.

9,1ep5co2,WIBTA if I didn't lend my study materials to my cousin after she disregarded my decision to quit working in order to study full time?,"My cousin (33F) and I (22F) are both lawyers. I have been a lawyer for three months, and she has been one for ten years. She is the only cousin I'm close too, and we always have been friends. When I got my license, we started working together.

A few months ago, we went to a party with the goal of meeting people and finding clients, and I began to notice things that I didn’t like. First, she never gave me space to speak, even when I tried very hard. Second, every time I gave an opinion on something, she said I was too young to know what I was talking about.

When we were heading home, I told her that if the intention was to promote me professionally, she wasn’t helping me by constantly emphasizing my age. It was a very uncomfortable car ride. In less than half an hour, she criticized my choice of specialization (I work in consumer and labor law, and she in pensions), saying that I would never get anywhere. She also criticized that I don’t invest in my social media and pressured me, saying that I haven’t achieved anything so far and have nothing to offer.

All of this made me feel resentful. I began to see her as a person who hasn’t grown as much as she would have liked over the past 10 years and is now projecting her frustrations onto me.

Being a lawyer in our country is difficult, and I concluded that I don’t want this for myself. For those studying law here, the safest career option is to get a position in public institutions. The selection processes are through exams, which are highly competitive and complex. 

After discussing with my family, I decided to stop practicing law to study for these exams. My father gave me full support, and gifted me a subscription to a study platform with video lessons and study materials. My cousin has also been taking these exams for a few years but has not passed yet.

I told her that I would no longer be practicing law to focus on the exams, and she was against it. She said I needed to work and that I wasn’t even trying hard enough as a lawyer to say I needed to give up. I was firm and said that I have a better chance of passing soon if I dedicate myself fully instead of splitting my efforts like she does. She was upset but accepted.

Yesterday she called me and asked how I was studying. I mentioned the platform my father gave me, and she said she wanted me to share one of the courses I have access to. “What’s yours is mine, and what’s mine is yours,” verbatim. It wasn’t a request, it was practically a demand, and I didn't know how to react. She had been criticizing my decision two days ago, and now she wants me to share my materials.

After a while I realised that she wasn't christan(I am religous just as my parents are) so I knew I couldn't act on it.

Following this, he makes a caustic face while moaning, mimicking a severely mentally challenged person. While this alone, in my opinion, is already a little harsh, I felt this was especially hurtful and unnecessary as since a young age, I have been bullied by both students, teachers, and parents about being ""autistic"" and ""retarded"" due to my ADHD, OCD, and dysgraphia to a level that is very unprecedented. I have been to 4 different schools, 2 of which were to escape this bullying, and I have been going to therapy and others forms of treatment since I was about 9-10.

I won't go into too much detail on it in this post, but I had committed to improving myself for about 2 years, which, while I definitely had a few both major and minor hiccups, generally was pretty static. I went to the gym regularly, starting a skincare routine, dedicated myself to schoolwork, etc. all of these major issues and events have built up in my mind, and, while my dad was definitely aware of this (or atleast as much as his stubbornness would allow), he still decided to come back at me. In response, I said ""fuck you dad"", something that would usually be a death sentence, but as I've grown up, my parents don't really care too much about swearing unless it's execessive. My dad decided to take this as hard as he could, and he slumped down and got quiet. I asked him what was wrong as when I responded, it wasn't intended to be hurtful, just more of a ""fuck off"". After questioning him, he just responded that ""he doesn't know how to communicate to me to stop wearing the headphones so much in any other way"",  ""wearing them makes me seem challenged"", "" it's not normal to wear headphones so much, their not an accessory like a hat"" and ""normal people don't  wear headphones very often, or atleast as much as you do"". This, to me, essentially felt like he was dodging the blame for what he said, and instead believed it was neccesary for him to say it and I was the one who was at fault here for wearing the headphones so much in a manner that is socially unacceptable acceptable and rude.

14,1ep4ewz,AITA for not giving my grandpa a bite of my burger?,"(First of all, I want to apologize because English isn’t my first language, so sorry for any grammar mistake) 
So, last day, my mom bought some burgers for me(17m) and my sister before going back home, when we got there, my grandparents were there and I started unwrapping my burger. My grandma saw me and asked if he could get a bite, to which I said “no, sorry”with an awkward smile.
For context, my grandma has a terrible dental hygiene, he doesn’t wash his teeth, I mean, his dentures, because his hygiene was so bad his original got teeth got rotten and fell off, plus he’s always smoking and drinking, which makes things worse because his breath smells like hell.
After that, my grandma and aunt said I was greedy, my sister told me I was a “muerto de hambre” which translates to “dead of hunger” and my mom just told me “Que bárbaro” which translates to “you were so wrong for that”. So, am I the asshole? I personally think I’m not because I don’t want to contract a thousand of unknown deseases, but what do y’all think?
Btw, I LOVE my grandpa, he’s the best, he’s the funniest, he’s a good dad, a awesome grandpa, and a good brother, but I just can’t stand his dental hygiene.

Pd: oh, I forgot, due to him always drinking beer and smoking, he’s also constantly spitting phlegms, GREEN BIG PHLEGMS

So, last day, my mom bought some burgers for me(17m) and my sister before going back home, when we got there, my grandparents were there and I started unwrapping my burger. My grandma saw me and asked if he could get a bite, to which I said “no, sorry”with an awkward smile.
For context, my grandma has a terrible dental hygiene, he doesn’t wash his teeth, I mean, his dentures, because his hygiene was so bad his original got teeth got rotten and fell off, plus he’s always smoking and drinking, which makes things worse because his breath smells like hell.
After that, my grandma and aunt said I was greedy, my sister told me I was a “muerto de hambre” which translates to “dead of hunger” and my mom just told me “Que bárbaro” which translates to “you were so wrong for that”. So, am I the asshole? I personally think I’m not because I don’t want to contract a thousand of unknown deseases, but what do y’all think?
Btw, I LOVE my grandpa, he’s the best, he’s the funniest, he’s a good dad, a awesome grandpa, and a good brother, but I just can’t stand his dental hygiene.

Pd: oh, I forgot, due to him always drinking beer and smoking, he’s also constantly spitting phlegms, GREEN BIG PHLEGMS

At that point I was furious and shouted abuse down the down (well across the vehicle) about how out of order it was and how they were free loaders and if they didn’t put the money in the account they wouldn’t be getting into my work event, admittedly I was really angry and not particularly kind, but they did go out of their way to make sure I was wound up, yet when I got wound up seemed to think I was a *expletive* now my partner was off with me the whole way home after being fine with me, well Sleeping mostly,  (maybe just infront of clients in hindsight) anyway I drilled him  and he said it as bang out of order what I said ok the phone about them all… erm maybe don’t try you’re hardest to wind me up then slag me when I get wound up!?!

16,1ep4efe,"AITA/mom, dad illness","My father was diagnosed with a severe form of cancer in July, and we are all struggling to cope. I don’t live with my family, but I have a flexible job until mid-October, so I decided to spend almost two months (half of July, all of August, plus 1-2 weeks in October) with my mother, even though I find it difficult to concentrate while working from home. He’s in the hospital, but I’m also visiting him, even though we are not allowed to stay too long—usually a half-hour every other day or even less, as he gets tired quickly.

I decided to help my mom organize her life alone during these two months and then, in September, return to my normal life.

I even planned to work for a few weeks in September from somewhere by the seaside where I can leave my phone in the room for a while to concentrate and recharge, as I usually do whenever I have the chance. However, this would only be from somewhere I can quickly fly home if there’s an emergency—and only if the situation doesn’t get too bad, of course. (He has a 50% chance of going into remission by then, but the illness can always reappear in the next five years.)

I told my mother I would probably leave town at the end of August and come back once more at the beginning of October. She got really mad, told me I’m completely selfish, and said I can already leave her alone if that’s what I really need or if I think this time is fine for a vacation.

I have always disliked this town, and now none of my friends live here either, so I basically have to stay cooped up in my mom’s home, partly without my SO, for at least three months, according to her wishes. There would be rare exceptions when some old friends visit, though.

I’m already struggling to cope with the situation (my father and I are very close), and my work is intellectual, requiring a lot of concentration and no distractions. This environment makes it difficult.

It is true that my mom also needs some practical help, but I hoped we could get it done this month.

Am I the asshole for wanting to leave, or is she exaggerating? Please answer sincerely, but kindly. I already feel like shit.

P.S. I have no siblings; my mom is living with her (fit) parents and has a very kind and helpful sister living a few houses away, doing everything she can for her.

18,1ep44wq,AITA For confessing to a friend,"I (20m) and my friend R (23f) have been friends for over a year and a half now. We have been talking and gaming every day since and I took an interest in advancing our friendship. Before that, we always slightly flirted but never went farther than a remark here and there. I took this as an opportunity a month ago to confess. All I said was that I was fond of her and I would like to know her stance. She didnt reject me but she didnt deny anything either. I took this as a sign to probably back off and didnt bring it up anymore.

Well for the past month she had amped up the flirting and so had I, I still made no attempt because I didnt want to make her uncomfortable. She had wanted me to get her initials shaved on my head the next time I got a haircut (?) so I took this as a sign that maybe this would one day turn into something. 

We were on call yesterday night and somehow the conversation had brought up my confession from a month ago. Out of no where she said ""you know, I used to block anyone who would ask me out"" I asked her why she didnt block me since I had basically done that. Her response was that she thought about it and was going to, but she had people tell her it wasnt ""good"" so she didnt. The way she worded it made it seem like she was expected not to do it and did not do it because she cared about our friendship. 

I was stunned and hurt because she thought about leaving after a lighthearted confession where I specifically said I didnt want to take it further if she didnt want to. She had also never been cold like this before. I tried to talk to her reasonably and ask her why she would do that. She said she didnt know and thats just the way she does things. She told me to talk to her and tell her what I was thinking/feeling. I told her I was hurt that she even thought of blocking me.

She proceeded to laugh when I said this and told me ""think about it this way"" ""I thought of it, but in the end, I didnt do it, thats all that matters"". I told her it still makes me feel like shit that shes laughing and acting like its no big deal. She then brought up that she has been the only one checking up on me a month later when no one else has and that we have been hanging out whenever we could. After wards she started to taunt me by saying ""oo is *my name* not gonna talk to me anymoree?"" in a sing songy voice. This obviously pissed me off but I said in a calm voice ""im gonna go to sleep, this isnt cool, R"" and she ended the call with ""alright hope you feel better"". 

Feel like shit because of what she originally thought and how she reacted to this. She has never done this before. I almost feel like I was overreacting and making something out of nothing since we always joke around but this was different. To be fair she didnt block me and I dont want to end this friendship since shes the closest friend to me at the moment.

20,1ep3ym3,WIBTA If I Asked My Mom's Boyfriend To Pay For A New Claw Clip?,"I (16F) live with my mom (45F), her boyfriend of two years (47ish M) (not my dad), and his two kids (10M and 9M) (not my biological brothers). Let's call the boyfriend Bob, and the 10-year old Jamie.

Edit: Disclaimer: This story is not about clipping an animals claws, but rather about those hair clips from the 90s and 2000s that are coming back in style, this caused some confusion earlier, so I'm just letting you guys know beforehand :)

Okay, so after some background info, let's start with the actual story. The older of the two kids, Jamie (10M) was home sick, so I agreed to stay home all day and watch him as I was still on summer break and he wasn't allowed to be home alone. I was in my room with the door open, so I could keep tabs on him and I decided to play the Sims 4 (don't judge me, I love this game). Being a 10-year-old in this day and age and having very limited screen time, any time Jamie was aware of anyone doing anything on a screen, he was there within seconds. So he came in my room and sat down on my bed, next to my desk so he could see me playing. I didn't mind, as I have gotten quite used to these kids being all up in my space and business. As I was playing, I noticed him pick up my claw clip from my desk from the corner of my eye. Once again, I did not mind and therefore didn't mention it.

This claw clip used to belong to my mom in the 2000s, but she never used it as her hair has been short for quite some time, so it slowly became mine over time, I kept it in my room and used it almost daily. It was very sturdy and had three prongs on each side, this will be important later.

So, on with the story, I was peacefully building a house in the Sims and he was fidgeting with the claw clip as he watched me. All of a sudden, I hear a crack sound, I assumed that the claw clip had slipped in his hand and had maybe pinched his skin, so I said: ""Whoops, don't hurt yourself with that"" without taking my eyes off the game. Jamie didn't answer me, which was weird as he's a quite talkative kid, but instead I heard him put the clip back on my desk and then he left without saying a word. I was weirded out and took a peak at the clip. One of the six prongs had broken off so the claw clip was useless. I didn't confront Jamie, I assumed he had done it accidentally and felt guilty and therefore was scared to admit to it.

Now comes the part where I might potentially become the a-hole. I'll probably buy myself a new clip, as I used the old one quite a lot, but I looked at it online and these clips are surprisingly expensive, at least in my country, and I don't have a job so I'm trying to save my money as best as I can and only spend it on things I really need. I'm wondering if I should ask Bob, my mom's boyfriend, to pay for it. I'm worried he might refuse, as I did let Jamie play with my clip, and because it wasn't originally bought with my money, and also just because he lowkey hates me. Would it be an a-hole move to ask? Is it reasonable? I never talk to him as I find him uncomfortable to be around and if it's dumb to ask, I would rather avoid any sort of confrontation.

I practiced with these people and got closer to them in the past few weeks learning our dances and shit. I also have a Discord server with a lot of IRL friends on it too and invited them as well. I was so excited to be partying with all my closest friends in and out of the court because some of them I haven’t seen in a hot minute. At first it was fun and we were all chatting and laughing in the dressing room the venue provided as we all got ready for our Debut performances (basically a waltz and a modern dance) and the server friends were there as well because we were all mutual friends. After the modern dance there were no more changes that needed to be made so I didn’t really think many people would still be going to that room. After the modern dance the DJ played line dances (todo todo ifykyk) and other good party songs as well. During one of the songs I walked to the table with all the server friends at and asked them to come to the floor and they stared at me, and looked away. I asked again and said something like “I feel like an asshole for begging but guys can you please come to the floor?” but still nothing. I walked back to the floor clearly upset and my best friend, I’ll give a fake name, Brook asked what was wrong and I told her and she reassured me that everything would be fine because her and my friends, Jade, Madi, and Jon were on the floor still.

Not at their table, but after asking around I found out not just those friends, but even my server friends were all upstairs chilling in the dressing room.

I was so excited to be partying with all my closest friends in and out of the court because some of them I haven’t seen in a hot minute. At first it was fun and we were all chatting and laughing in the dressing room the venue provided as we all got ready for our Debut performances (basically a waltz and a modern dance) and the server friends were there as well because we were all mutual friends. After the modern dance there were no more changes that needed to be made so I didn’t really think many people would still be going to that room. After the modern dance the DJ played line dances (todo todo ifykyk) and other good party songs as well. During one of the songs I walked to the table with all the server friends at and asked them to come to the floor and they stared at me, and looked away. I asked again and said something like “I feel like an asshole for begging but guys can you please come to the floor?” but still nothing. I walked back to the floor clearly upset and my best friend, I’ll give a fake name, Brook asked what was wrong and I told her and she reassured me that everything would be fine because her and my friends, Jade, Madi, and Jon were on the floor still. I took a deep breath and kept dancing trying to stay positive because I didn’t want that to ruin my night. I don’t really remember what happened afterwards but I do remember a certain song playing and looking for them and not seeing them. Not at their table, but after asking around I found out not just those friends, but even my server friends were all upstairs chilling in the dressing room. I was fighting tears trying to not let this get the best of me because I felt a little disrespected by their presence, or lack thereof, during my party. I don’t know what I should do. My dad and my uncle said that it wasn’t disrespectful and that I should let it go, but my aunt says that it was rude of them to not celebrate with me. I don’t know if I should talk to them about how I feel or if I should let it go because I don’t want to escalate things. I hate that I spent the night of my 18th birthday party crying but I am just seriously stuck on how I should feel. What should I do? AITA for thinking it was rude?",0.0,1.0050811767578125,1,0
22,1ep3uy2,AITA for not washing my boyfriend's clothes unless he puts them IN the laundry basket?,"I (29F) have been with my boyfriend (31M) for 3 years, living together for 2. When we first started living together, we both were really struggling mentally and physically. We both were working jobs that took advantage of us and drained us, and we both have chronic health/pain issues. We live somewhere where rent is extremely high. 

Recently I have gone on a mostly paid (about 75% of my salary) leave of absence from work while I get my health under control. A leave isn't viable for him in his job. We still split bills 50/50. He takes care of cooking dinner and grocery shopping, and I do everything else. He used to be in charge of cleaning the kitchen, but he was doing a very poor job. I eventually told him that since I wasn't working, I'd do all the cleaning in the house, as well as the laundry. BUT that I expected him to not leave petty messes, as he has a habit of doing (e.g. leaving his dirty clothes on the floor, leaving wrappers and empty containers on the counter instead of putting them in the recycling/garbage, not cleaning up any spills he makes, etc.). 

I was hoping this would lead to us having a cleaner space, take some of the load off of him since I can tell he's struggling, and prevent me from becoming resentful. But he is still making constant petty messes. I was constantly reminding him to clean up after himself, and he was annoyed every time. We had a huge blowup fight about it, where he says feels he's being judged, and my expectations are unreasonable. I told him I'm not judging him for having messy habits, I'm upset that he is unwilling to try and change those habits. That I promised myself I would never be one of those women who is a mommy/maid for their partner, and that's how I feel constantly following him around and picking up after him.

We had a really good talk a couple days ago, and in some ways I can see he's trying, though there's still many petty messes. Yesterday he asked me do do 3 loads of his laundry that were in his “re-wear” basket, expressing that “he has almost no clothes left”. We have a big basket that is always for dirty laundry, and the reason why none of his clothes have been washed is because he hadn’t been putting his clothes in there. I started the loads. Today, I went to do the laundry in the “dirty laundry” bin, and he has several clothing items that he’s just put ON TOP of the laundry basket instead of taking the time to lift the lid and put it inside. This is really annoying for me, because this is exactly the shit I’ve been telling him I need him to do, and then he says it’s too much for him, and I retort that he can lift a lid. 

WIBTA if I leave those clothes there and don’t wash them until he puts them INSIDE the bin? I feel like I’m losing my mind. He’ll definitely tell me I’m being petty, but I feel like he won’t learn until there’s tangible consequences.

She wanted nothing to do with him except for the money she thought she was entitled to when he died. He had 2 life insurance policies, one for his kids (100,000.  each) and a 50,000 for me that was money left from our mother's and grandmother's inheritance.
I had to fly to Nebraska and settle his estate, pay for funeral expenses, clean up his house and put it on the market. Before I could put up his house (that he bought post divorce, she still had the marital home that he paid for) she brought out an old will that put her brother as the executor. So she got all of it. I did take some things that were our families to begin with. One being a comforter that I crocheted for them. I did ask her at the time if she wanted it back, to which she replied ""I don't want that piece of trash"". So I brought it home.

29,1ep2vkq,AITA for quitting 20 minutes before shift?,"So let's back up to 8 months ago when I first started. I am a great worker, never late, always asking for things to do when we're slow. I ask my manager every few weeks for feedback or constructive critism. Always get told she has no notes. The only frustrating thing at this point is last minute schedules. As in scheduled is released on Sunday for the very next day. Frequently I would get off work on Sunday and not know my shift for the next day. Eventually things settle and I am working the same shifts every week. In April I requested a day off for July. Requested it more than 90 days in advance. I never hear any thing back so I assume it's approved because she'd tell me if it wasn't right? We'll schedules are released Sundays, so I get my schedule and see I'm scheduled for the next Sunday, the day I requested off. I'm appalled. She's had 90 days to get it covered or tell me it's not approved but doesn't? How is that fair. I bring it up and she tells me it's my responsibility to get the shift covered or get a write up for not coming in. Fine. I try to get it covered but am unable to but I also can't skip my plans out side of work. So I skip work and get a write up. I go to check my schedule that night for the next day and the app isn't working so I just assume my schedule is the same as always because to me, a good manager would warn me if my schedules going to be different. Next day I get a call 2 hours before when I thought I had to be there asking me where the hell am I. I try to explain the app wasn't working the night before and she snaps at me that I'm selfish and clearly I'm not there because my schedule isn't what I want. And I am appalled. I have never been late for a shift and only called out the one time for a day I requested off months in advance. I go in and am getting nasty looks from my manager and my coworker all day. No one will talk to me either. I keep trying to ask questions about work related things and am being ignored. No one will even listen to my side of the story. So the next morning I'm laying in bed really not wanting to deal anymore and get an offer letter from a job I'd  interviewed at recently. And I emailed my now previous manager 20 minutes before I was supposed to start that I resigned effective immediately. Am I the asshole here? I feel like I wasn't treated very fairly in the end. There obviously was other stuff going on because I was already interviewing at other places. But I kinda feel guilty and my partner keeps telling me I shouldn't. What do yall think? ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-10,"AITA for quitting 20 minutes before shift? So let's back up to 8 months ago when I first started. I am a great worker, never late, always asking for things to do when we're slow. I ask my manager every few weeks for feedback or constructive critism. Always get told she has no notes. The only frustrating thing at this point is last minute schedules. As in scheduled is released on Sunday for the very next day. Frequently I would get off work on Sunday and not know my shift for the next day. Eventually things settle and I am working the same shifts every week. In April I requested a day off for July. Requested it more than 90 days in advance. I never hear any thing back so I assume it's approved because she'd tell me if it wasn't right? We'll schedules are released Sundays, so I get my schedule and see I'm scheduled for the next Sunday, the day I requested off. I'm appalled. She's had 90 days to get it covered or tell me it's not approved but doesn't? How is that fair. I bring it up and she tells me it's my responsibility to get the shift covered or get a write up for not coming in. Fine. I try to get it covered but am unable to but I also can't skip my plans out side of work. So I skip work and get a write up. I go to check my schedule that night for the next day and the app isn't working so I just assume my schedule is the same as always because to me, a good manager would warn me if my schedules going to be different. Next day I get a call 2 hours before when I thought I had to be there asking me where the hell am I. I try to explain the app wasn't working the night before and she snaps at me that I'm selfish and clearly I'm not there because my schedule isn't what I want. And I am appalled. I have never been late for a shift and only called out the one time for a day I requested off months in advance. I go in and am getting nasty looks from my manager and my coworker all day. No one will talk to me either. I keep trying to ask questions about work related things and am being ignored. No one will even listen to my side of the story.

30,1ep2t12,AITA for attending my parents friends events?,"
I’m a 30F married with a 14 month old. To this day and many days previously, my parents are constantly asking my brother and I to attend their friend’s parties or functions. We do not know them on a personal level though apparently they have sent birthday cards previously. We didn’t grow up with these people at our house or see them at family gatherings. From what my parents tell me, they met my brother and I when we were very little. No memory of it. 

Recently, a close friend of my parents was having a funeral for her dad. I only met him once when this family hosted a joint graduation party for my brother and their son (they also don’t know each other, that was the first time they met). My parents were pretty upset that I told them I wasn’t making the funeral because it was at the same time as my toddler’s nap. 

Tomorrow, the same family is having a get together and their grown kids are flying in for a day. My mom   calls and asked me to come so I can meet their kids (who are the same age as my brother and I) and says we need to attend to show support as a family given the recent death. 

I’m not heartless, but it seemed pretty random for me to show up at someone’s funeral that I didn’t know personally nor the family.

These functions are not fun. I get to spend a solid 2 hours talking about my career and how I like it, my husbands career, where we went to school, my son and his development and what are our future plans to have more kids etc etc… not to mention my parents get to play show and tell with my brother and I and showcase all of our achievements while everyone else does the same for their kids…

31,1ep2siu,"AITA for being a ""jerk"" to my kids?","A year ago, me (54F) and my kids (17M and 16M) came to a country in Africa from the United States. It was originally intended for vacation, however, a week before school started for them (the one in the US), I told my kids that they will be staying here. There was an argument about losing opportunities (my oldest did football, basketball, and JROTC and took AP and honors classes while my youngest competed in the school's math competition and got first place), because I didn't think before making the decision, and I then told them that I will be sending them to prison if they didn't stop arguing.



So for a year now, my sons have been arguing with me about the school they are going to. The school they are going to is an online school which doesn't have the same opportunities as the school my kids went to back in the US. My kids told me that the school doesn't have any honors classes and little AP classes, none of which is what my kids want. I'd tell them that they will be fine and I also usually tell them to take the normal classes and graduate early, but none of my kids want that (they don't feel ready to graduate early). So the occasional arguments would happen but I would always tell them that their dad (69M) will send my kids back so I can get the argument to end.



Today my youngest son came up to me and asked me if he can return to the US by the start of the school year. I told him, ""ask your father"" (I make the decisions to send my kids back, but I tell them that its their dad to get them to be quiet). My oldest then heard the commotion and joined in and said that he needed to go back to for his JROTC, other extracurricular activities and his honors/AP classes. I told him to ask his dad too. An argument ensued, with both of my kids telling me that he is not the one who decides; I am (which is true). They also told me that they have lost a lot of opportunities, for example my youngest didn't get to do his math competition, and my eldest didn't get to do JROTC and go back for his school year (he was a junior and junior year is known to be extremely important, now he is a senior). Another thing they told me is that the online school they are going to now is difficult (70% and above is considered passing) and they are not interested in the classes the are taking. I got sick of their complaining and told them that they will not go back to the Us because of the way they are behaving; that they can't shower, they can't cook, and they can't clean. They then told me that their behavior has nothing to do with what and where they want to do high school and that I am controlling their choices about their school and their activities associated with school. They then called me a huge jerk and a controlling toxic parent who loves ""mistreating"" them. I then lost it and called a relative to pick them up and take them to their house.

So my question is. Am I the asshole for wanting to go tear it down because they didn't ask. Or even attempt to ask us to use our fence ? We have cameras and none of our cameras show them coming over to even attempt to ask. 


I did not ruin a little kids birthday but I really wanted to because they are very rude people and are constantly telling us to stay on our property. They are loud, disruptive and they bang on our fence many of times. They also allow they're special needs son to wander on our property and put his fingers in our fence. We have 2 dogs that are not friendly to people they don't know so this is cause for concern. ",2.0,-0.0048616360872983,0,0

40,1ep1sxz,AITA for stealing my friend/co-workers limelight knowing I got the job because of him?,"This might be a long post, so please bear with me. Here’s the backstory: I have a full-time job and recently ventured into as a Virtual Assistant for side hustle thanks to a family friend. He’s kind of the trusted person for our client, essentially the head of the offshoure account. The company is a startup with a lot of things to fix and improve. This excites me because I’ve been in the corporate world for almost 10 years and in management for 8. I have a strong work ethic, work my ass off, and have amazing mentors. My peers and colleagues from my full time job are also achievers with no ego problems, thanks to our manager and mentor. 

Now, my friend is younger and has always worked as a virtual assistant. This world is a whole different ball game, but I was ready for it.

To keep it short, my friend is the “golden boy” of the company, and he deserves it because he’s a hard worker. Then I came along, not to steal the limelight but to help when needed. The company owner reached out to me directly for extra tasks, which I was okay with because I enjoy the work and have plans to help the company grow. I shared these plans with my friend, but it happened more than three times that my ideas were passed to our boss without me being credited. I didn’t take it personally; maybe he had those ideas too.

A few months in, I was trusted with HR tasks, hiring, and other small projects. My friend also handles various projects. Despite giving him credit in some of mine, I sensed some negative tension. He has a mindset that his department always gets the blame, leading to a defensive culture and unhealthy competition between his department and mine.

Moreover, I often receive commendations for my work from the general manager and the company owner. He also gets a lot commendation and recognition. 

Recently, he managed a big client, and there were multiple errors, mostly his fault. I was not even involved in this project.

Then, he messaged me directly, saying his team feels left out and undervalued, and my team gets all the credit. Which is not the case, he feels when I get 1 commendations, they should have 2 or 3. Again, such unhealthy competition.

He also said, he regrets asking me to work with them. He’s even considering leaving the company because of this situation. What’s worse is how he’s influenced his supervisor to think that I’m at fault for their feelings of being left out and that we get all the credit, which isn’t true.

We have hung out in group settings a decent amount of times this summer, and have had some good conversations, but practically every time I talk to him, he spends the first 20 minutes or so of interacting making fun of me. I play it off and don’t really engage but it has been really bothering me. The few times I’ve tried to bring it up, he says I’ve been a bad friend for not spending time with him one on one, and claims I don’t take accountability for my actions and am bad at communicating. I have a very low social battery and have been working a good amount this summer, so I like to spend most of the days I’m free alone. I’ve told him this and said that if we plan a week in advance, it would be easier to hang. He doesn’t respect that I have a low social battery and makes fun of me for it. He also doesn’t ever try and make plans at the beginning of the week.

He has been having some mental health problems recently, and I feel really bad, but it’s just extremely difficult for me to talk to him when we do hang out, and I don’t really want to spend time with him if he’s going to make fun of me. Additionally, I’ve made it known that I am not comfortable hanging out with him when all he does is use drugs, and would prefer to hangout with him when he’s sober, and he agreed to do so. However, every single time we hang out and he agrees to not use drugs, he ends up doing them anyway. He says I’m bad at responding but whenever we come up with a day we’re both free, he doesn’t to reach out to me further and says I have to reach out to him to set it up. I also have made it known to him that I don’t like hanging out later in the day, but when we have come up with an exact time, he tells me a couple hours before he had a change of plans and can only hang in the evening. He was saying and doing all this stuff before I started spending less time with him, and as I reduced the amount of time we hung out together, the frequency of him making fun of me and getting upset at me has increased. 

He makes me feel guilty because he talks about all the mental issues he’s been dealing with when we finally do have a real conversation, but I just really don’t want to hang out with him, and know he has a good support group and friends who do spend time with him. AITA for not hanging out?

44,1ep0ult,AITA for not agreeing with my mom about giving my sister in law family jewelry? ,"

Backstory: I'm named after my grandmother. My grandmother was a wealthy, eccentric woman who was treated my mother like the dirt on the bottom of her shoe. 

She left this world with tons of jewelry that hasn't been touched since she died 25 years ago. My mom has kept all of her jewelry in multiple safes. Hardly any of it in general is my style, my mother's style, or my sister's style. 

Circling back to the fact that I'm named after my grandmother; a lot of her jewelry is this crazy, blinged out initial jewelry that I would never, ever wear, but is obviously being passed down to me for this reason.

My husband and I are really struggling right now to make ends meet due to some unforeseen medical bills and home repairs. We have our first kid on the way and could really use some extra cash. I asked my mom if it would be okay for me to sell all of my initial jewelry for scrap gold/diamonds. Her response was absolutely not, and that if I didn't want it, she was going to take it from me and pass it on to my brother's wife who also shares the same first initial.

I was taken aback for a few reasons...the most important being that my mom has confided in me that their marriage is pretty unstable, and that there are concerns that if the marriage falls through, she's going to try to squeeze my brother dry. She has a very cutthroat personality and I know that she would take the jewelry for the sake of taking it and then would eventually sell it when she has the opportunity. Just like I would have done. 

I told my mom that I was shocked by her response given…everything…and then attempted to compromise. If she wasn't willing to give me the initial jewelry to sell for cash, could I maybe use the money to have new pieces that I would *actually* wear and cherish? Again, no. She proceeded to tell me that I'm being really greedy and selfish for feeling like my need for $ is more important than giving my SIL a chance to take the jewelry. I don’t understand what the sentimental attachment is also given that my mom and her mother had no relationship with one another. 

AITA here?

TLDR; I'm named after my late grandmother and was given the option to keep this initial jewelry of hers that isn't my style at all. When I asked my mom for permission to sell it, she said no, and that she'd give it to my brother's wife who also has the same first initial, and that I'm being greedy.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-10,"AITA for not agreeing with my mom about giving my sister in law family jewelry?

To start this off I am 21 and 21 weeks pregnant, we just found out we are having a baby girl at our gender reveal. I’ll give a bit of back story so it helps, my bio mum and mother in law don’t exactly like each other my partner and I are aware of this and we just ask they be civil if they have to see each other, which makes things pretty awkward. I don’t have the best relationship with my bio mum as is, which is hard but it’s how it is unfortunately. So the day before my gender reveal I was talking to my mum as she was unable to be here for the day due to being sick, while talking she asked why she’s never been invited to stay over with my partner and I, (we live with my in laws due to how expensive everything is) I stated she isn’t allowed over due to my mum and mother in law don’t get along and I never want to make my mother in law feel uncomfortable in her own home. This lead to my mum getting the cranky pants and hanging up on me. The day of the gender reveal just as everything is getting started and all guests are arriving I got a phone call from my grandfather (mums dad) yelling at me and saying how I need to sort all this out because it’s not fair on my mum that she can’t come over and see my baby when I have her, when I stated as my grandfather doesn’t live far I’ll take my baby there for her to see. This lead to me giving my phone to my dad for the day as I didn’t want the drama that I felt was coming. I made the call after the way my grandfather had spoken to me rudely and going off at not only me but my siblings that I wasn’t going to include my mum over FaceTime as I was hurt everything was happening on the day we were celebrating my baby and finding out the gender when it could have been handled a different day. I later sent my mum the video of the reveal so she could see that my baby was in fact a girl. Within half hour I had my stepdad call and abuse me for breaking my mother and that she is beside herself and it’s all my fault and that I should have my act together.

She just stormed off and refuses to talk now. She's the only one I feel comfortable talking to about these things since she's his daughter and understands the dynamics better than anyone else could.

49,1ep00xl,AITA: for being nice to my coworker?,"Hey Reddit. First time poster here. 

I’m keeping as much as i can anonymous because I’m not sure if my coworker nor their spouse are on here either. 

I work remote, 1 state away from my jobs corporate office. I work in a department of 50+ for the last 4 years. There has been some turnover as of late, so I have a bunch of new employees asking me questions about the job. I like to think I’m nice and friendly, so i build rapport with coworkers talking about family, spouses, interests etc.

As of late, there is one new employee who i get along with well. Always talk about work, family, spouses that’s it. 

They’ve mentioned before they think I’d get along great with their spouse and to friend them on Facebook. Ok sure. This is not unusual for my industry. 

Well, today that spouse told me to stop speaking to my coworker, that if i respect them I’d do this, they’ve spoken to their spouses multiple times about the “unprofessional” way i speak to them (we talk about work, kids, etc only) and that if i don’t they will stop associating with myself and my co worker. 

Given, I’ve never met either of them, i just said ok and said how sorry i was and that I’ve never wanted to cause problems. 


Now, I’m not sure if i actually did something wrong or if this is just a “them” and their marriage problem.

50,1eozxtu,AITA for not paying for my friend?,"I (22F) have a good friend who is also (22F). This girl has always been very sweet and we’ve been friends since high school. However, it’s a challenge to hang out with her sometimes. She can’t drive, (doesn’t have a license or a car), and doesn’t have any money or a job. She’s also not in school or anything ( never went to college).

I am a senior in college and have worked since I was 16. However, I am extremely grateful for my parents who pay for my necessities until I graduate this year. I have always been somewhat financially frugal with my own money as I want to have savings. Anyways. this friend doesn’t have any money, she gets like 50$ a week from her parents, but that’s it. Anytime we go somewhere, whether it’s my idea or hers, I drive. When we go get drinks/ food, I pay. Recently she wanted to get some vodka and when we got to the store she said she forgot her ID, and asked me to go in and get it. Didn’t offer to pay even half. And I didn’t want the vodka in the first place. You get the point. 

I feel like an asshole for complaining about this but it’s getting frustrating. I shouldn’t have to pay for her stuff most of the time just because I have more money than her, right? If it were an emergency or something OF COURSE I would help out. But on a day to day basis, she needs to be paying for her own things. 

I have started making excuses for why I can’t pay for her/drive everywhere, and she has been understanding.

But it usually takes 10-15 mins. So she just leaves me on mute. I feel like it kills my vibe and I’m frustrated. It’s evident in my tone when she comes back and I don’t try to hide it.

52,1eozsvg,AITA for reading my friend's text messages?,"I'm (24F) friends with Sarah (24F), who moved to my city 7 years ago. I’ve always made an effort to include her in my family events and vacations since she doesn’t have any nearby family. Over the years, I’ve felt like her primary support system, especially since her family is far away. For example, she often stayed at my house to avoid being alone, and I’d include her in various activities, even if it was just me and my boyfriend.

Sarah's only previous relationship was brief and happened back in her hometown. About a year ago, she started dating Karl (36M). While I have personal reservations about significant age differences in relationships, I tried to keep an open mind and support her. Sarah used to share intimate details about their relationship, but things changed when Karl ghosted her for a month. I made a poorly-timed joke about Karl possibly having died, which upset Sarah. Later, it turned out he had a heart attack, which explained his sudden absence.

Sarah stopped sharing details about her relationship after this incident. Despite her reassurance that everything was fine, I noticed troubling signs: she was losing weight rapidly, showing signs of anxiety, having trouble sleeping, and writing huge texts to Karl that went unanswered. She frequently stayed at my place, but whenever I asked about Karl or his impact on her, she insisted everything was okay and didn’t want to discuss their private life. She also refused to see a therapist, claiming she could handle her anxiety alone.

A while ago, while using an old laptop Sarah had been using, I found she hadn’t logged out of her account. Out of growing concern, I decided to read her messages. I discovered that Karl had been controlling and emotionally manipulative. He forbids her from initiating contact, limits their communication to a minute a day, and has only seen her a few times, primarily for sex. He also pressured her into a threesome with another man, despite her clear discomfort.

The shock didn’t end there. I also found messages where Sarah and her mom were discussing me and my loved ones in a deeply hurtful manner. They mocked my boyfriend, who had been supportive of Sarah, and even laughed about my pregnant sister’s appearance. They discussed how I supposedly only cared about their relationship and implied that I was a bad friend and an overbearing person.

Despite my betrayal, I still tried to be there for Sarah. A month has passed since I uncovered these revelations, and I’m still deeply hurt by the way they spoke about me and my family. Sarah hasn’t noticed any change in my behavior or our relationship. I feel conflicted about having read her private messages, but I wanted to understand her situation better and support her.

54,1eoznaw,AITA for making a comment about my sister's event outfit? ,"So I (21F) am pregnant with my first child this October. Me and my family are planning a baby shower out of state because of where my family lives. 
My sister (36F), I'll call her Mary for this, has been going on and on about how she needs to buy a new outfit for this baby shower for herself. I ignored it the first few times she mentioned it, just not really caring at that point. Two days ago, however, Mary came to my house unannounced saying she needed help choosing a dress color because she was ordering it. I wasn't feeling the best that day and feel like I may have overreacted, but I had said that I didn't see why it was such a big deal anyway, and I guess I would have to try to look decent too since it was for me. 
Mary, in turn, comptely ignored me and said she needs to pick a color that would make her fake tan look great. She also went on about how she needs to get her nails and hair done to look perfect for this event as well. I had made a comment that maybe we should just say it's her baby shower since she is putting so much effort to look nice.
 I don't even like events where I would get a lot of attention, I guess I just got annoyed because she has 3 children and everything always becomes about her. I would love to be able to go out and buy a whole new outfit and get pampered for this one thing, but money is extremely tight, and I'm struggling as I am a single mom (husband left). My sister spends ridiculous amounts of money for no reason, and I think I was more upset that she was more worried to look better than me no matter what then help with anything ever. 
Keep in mind, I babysit her kids (supposed to get paid, but she never does) constantly so I do feel entitled for her to help a little.
 She is now complaining to family and friends that I am overexaggerating and trying to make her have less of a good time at this baby shower. I never wanted to have to ""step up"" my game to look nice at this, I just assumed everyone would know it was a celebration for me and my baby. So... AITA?

I realized that I wasn't super clear with all of my info. My sister and I don't get along great, because she notoriously uses me (sadly).

55,1eozmig,AITA for asking my sister and brother in law to clean up after dinner?,"I (19F) live with my (22F) sister and her husband (24M) in a small condo. I moved in at the same time as my sister 3 years ago, and her husband moved in with us about 2 years ago. My sister recently had a baby. As you can imagine this is a very stressful and overwhelming time in their lives. My sister quit her job and became a full time mom, while her husband works full time. I’m not sure how much time they spend together outside of nighttime and dinner because I also work full time, and usually come home quite late. Recently my sister and brother in law have started eating dinner very late, usually by the time I’m in bed. For the past few weeks, I’ve woken up to the living room/dining room very dirty, with plates left out half eaten, flies buzzing around, and drinks with juice half full in them. 
The first few times it’s happened, I’ve just cleaned it up without a word, because I know they must be really stressed out, but as the messes have gotten more frequent, I was beginning to get frustrated, as I have a very hard time around germs and gross things like half eaten food. I texted our group chat a few days ago before work asking if they could please work on not leaving their dishes out in the living room, and try to clean up before they went to bed.
I checked my texts a few hours later to my sister texting me:

 “We have a new baby, nobody said we weren’t going to clean it we just wanted to comfort her over cleaning in that moment. Don’t clean it next time. Or try helping with the dishesssssss“

I got super hurt and upset by this because I work full time and think that I do my fair share of house work, including dishes, while my brother in law basically doesn’t do anything but laundry. I pointed out to her that no matter what she said about cleaning it up, it still wasn’t done by morning, and I had to be the one to do it. I also told her I wasn’t expecting her to do the dishes, just scrape off the left over food and put everything in the sink.
She got mad and said that I have no idea what it’s like to have a baby and that nobody asked me to clean it. The issue is that when I leave it alone, the whole house smells gross, which is super upsetting to me. 
We got into a verbal argument and it hasn’t really been resolved.

I have known my friend for over a decade and we had a decent relationship. However, recently I noticed a few behaviours from him that suggests that the friendship wasn't as 2-way as I thought. However, due to the fact of how long I've known him and that he is within a significant friendship group of mine, I didn't really bring anything up and let things slide.  
  
Now this ""wedding"". His fiancée lives in the same country as us but she is from country abroad. They choose to have the wedding a month ago in her country and we were invited to come. The circumstances of the invite was strange, it was brought up a year ago because another friend saw R's was acting very differently and jokingly suggested that R had proposed. R then told us it was true and that he wanted us to come to the wedding. He told us to share the news with a couple other mutuals in the friend group (which I thought was weird - surely it needs to come from R). We told the mutuals about it and how it was going to be abroad and understandably, they couldn't make it.  
  
I told my friend that I'll be there even though it would cost $1000. A friend wanted to buy tickets while cheap to save money but I suggested that we wait due to R's unreliable history - I said to at least wait for a deposit to be put on the venue. Sure enough, the wedding got cancelled due to reasons and a new date was rearranged.  
  
The new date got arranged (6 months later...) and this time I was told that the deposit was sorted and most things were arranged. However, due to financial reasons, I remained cautious and waited until the month before booking flights. Other friends all declined the second invite as they couldn't make it for reasons. I asked R if family and close friends had brought tickets and he stated 33 people were definitely flying out. A couple days before I was about to book the ticket, a friend called and told me that R couldn't make the wedding and that this information was known for a while. I was furious with the fact that this information wasn't shared but i didn't say anything as R was having a hard time. This could have cost $1000!!! That literally could have gone towards my rent.  
  
The morning of the wedding, I got a text saying that there was a gathering at his house and that the wedding venue abroad was still being used by his fiancée family as they spent so much money on it.

64,1eowzcp,AITA for expecting my boyfriend not to play video games when on a call with me? ,"My boyfriend and I are in a long distance relationship. Video calls are currently the only way we have of spending time together. When calling today on video, he had the camera down and was busy on a game. 

I stopped what I was doing to call and got annoyed that he asked to call but was doing something else. Even though he was still chatting/ using his voice to communicate, as communication is so limited between us, I expected him to at least make time for a face to face chat as it’s the weekend and I’m currently in the hospital. 

I was silent after a bit and he asked if I wanted to talk or say something. I said not to your ceiling I don’t.

",No A-holes here,2024-08-10,"AITA for expecting my boyfriend not to play video games when on a call with me?  My boyfriend and I are in a long distance relationship. Video calls are currently the only way we have of spending time together. When calling today on video, he had the camera down and was busy on a game. 

I stopped what I was doing to call and got annoyed that he asked to call but was doing something else. Even though he was still chatting/ using his voice to communicate, as communication is so limited between us, I expected him to at least make time for a face to face chat as it’s the weekend and I’m currently in the hospital. 

I was silent after a bit and he asked if I wanted to talk or say something. I said not to your ceiling I don’t.

65,1eowr39,AITAH for leaving my sister at a party / bar?,"Me (28F) and my sister (29F) have never had an amazing relationship, but we’re both trying. My biggest issue is that (in my opinion) she can be really mean and harsh, and she always ascribes negative intentions to me regardless of what I say.

I drove to her place and from there we shared an Uber (which I paid for as she was going to pay the way back) to a family member’s birthday party at a bar. After a few hours I wanted to leave but she didn’t want to. I was trying to make conversation because we didn’t know anyone there but two family members. I asked her opinion about something (not something important just a science fact we had disagreed about before) because I wanted to know more about what she thought. She made a face and essentially told me  (in what my opinion was a mean way) to stop talking about it because I was going to argue with her. I said that wasn’t my intention, I was just interested in hearing more about what she thought, and that she didn’t need to be mean about it. After a short bicker I said well you don’t want to leave and you don’t want to talk to me so I don’t know what you want. She said, verbatim, “you don’t have to wait for me if you don’t want to”. So I said ok I’m going home then if you’re just going to berate for something I haven’t even done yet. So I took an Uber home and told her she could come with me if she wanted. She stayed and went home and hour later.

Since then she’s been texting me saying things like that I’m a manipulative entitled jerk who only cares about myself. I said I was sorry for my part in the fight, and also expressed my perspective that I felt it was unfair to tell me I can leave and then get mad when I do. She told me I would “rather play the victim than admit I did anything wrong” and that I “abandoned her when the conversation didn’t go my way”. She said she’s not being mean she’s just “telling me the truth”, and if I don’t like it I’m just “sad to be wrong” and have a bruised ego because I don’t want to hear the truth. I just repeated that I was sorry for my part and hope she can see my side too. She said she didn’t do anything wrong, and I didn’t really mean my apology, so she’s not accepting it.

Sorry I know this is gonna sound kind of stupid as sibling conflicts often do. Imo It’s not like I left her stranded somewhere, I left her with two family members a twenty minute Uber ride from her house. I already paid for the Uber there so she was going to pay for the one back anyway, and I’m not asking her to pay me back for the ride we were splitting.

67,1eovh1q,AITA for telling the truth about how the bride looks?,"I F(24) dabble in photography quite often as for a career I design clothing and model it to save costs. So when my brother Jake M(21) asked me to photograph his wedding, I of course agreed. My brothers wife, Chelsea(22) is a very kind woman, however her stylistic choices can sometimes be a bit wild. I do not judge at all because I know innovation is part of self expression.

Chelsea showed me her wedding makeup, and she had these vibrant green contacts on. They looked extremely reptilian on her due to it not matching her undertone. When she showed me the picture, I told her she looked lovely, but that the contacts weren't the best. She seemed a bit offended, and told me she just wanted to look ""exotic like you"". I offered to find her some more natural contacts but she wouldn't relent.

On her wedding day, as I took pictures, the contacts looked even worse, like a neon green light up sign. When Jake was free for a moment, I showed him a few pictures. He called Chelsea over, and she seemed to be happy with the pictures, while Jake seemed a bit iffy. Chelsea asked what I thought, and I told her she looked stunning, but I then asked if she'd like me to edit the contrast a bit in the pictures. She then got extremely defensive, and accused me of calling her ugly on her own wedding day. Of course that was not my intention, but I left early to prevent a scene.

  
Edits to answer some questions:

  
1. The bride was not being racist with the exotic comment, English is her second language, I just look unconventional.

  
2. I left the wedding at 1am instead of 3, they had lots of pictures taken by me

  
3. I asked her about the edits at the wedding itself as she wanted them posted ASAP on my account and hers. I didn't want her to receive rude comments from our relatives, my followers or anything like that, but I also didn't want her to be edited without consent.

Husband went to get a snack and there was a foul inside the box, which meant our team got a penalty kick up close to the goal. These are a big deal because the kicking team almost always scores and we were tied at that point.

Another season ticket holder, whose seats were slightly down and diagonal from ours, stood up to watch the penalty kick. Normally, this is not a big deal. People stand up sometimes to celebrate a goal, go to the restroom, or yell at the referee. But nobody else was standing and he was blocking the view of several people.

So I leaned forward and said, “Sir, we can’t see.” He didn’t respond, so I repeated myself a little louder. He finally turned around and said, “It’s a sporting event. People are going to stand up. You can stand too.” And turned back around. I didn’t stand up because I’m taller than average and there were people sitting behind me that I didn’t want to block their view. 

Now, the couple directly in front of us is older and they’ve been friends of ours for years. The man had a stroke and uses a cane, a leg brace, and has a service dog. He can’t stand up very easily, so I felt insulted on his behalf, but I chalked it up to the other guy being an AH and craned around him to watch the PK.

After the set piece, everyone sat down and we continued watching the game. But the other guy turned around and caught my eye. He goes, “Should I stand up for the rest of the game?” I didn’t know what to say to that - I had moved on. And then he says, “ You’re being kind of an asshole.”

My cousin intervened at that point, telling the guy he’s probably had enough beer and he needs to stfu before my husband gets back. That was the end of it, but the guy kept peeking back at us until my husband returned.

So was it inappropriate to inform the guy that he was blocking the line of sight? People do this all the time when they are trying to find their seats or get distracted on the way down the stairs and block the line of sight, so we all just got used to telling people they are blocking the game.

69,1eouiz7,AITA for giving my wedding dress to my future daughter-in-law instead of my stepdaughter?,"w/ update!!

I 42F got married 24 years ago. I decided that if I had a daughter, I would pass the dress and accessories on to her. I chose a simple, elegant dress, rather than what was fashionable at the time, because I wanted something timeless that people could wear for generations to come. I had my son “Mark” now 22M a year after, and his father passed away when he was young. I raised Mark as a single mom for several years. I decided that when Mark married, I would give my dress and accessories to his wife.

When I was 33, I met “Rob” now 52M. I fell in love with him and we quickly married. He became a great father figure for Mark, and I was so excited to have a stepdaughter, “Molly” now 24F. My relationship with Molly had a rocky beginning. I’ve been patient and gentle with her. I’ve offered to take her shopping or get her nails done. I asked Rob about her favorite foods and made sure to cook those. She made it clear that she didn’t see me as her real mom.

Years passed, and I never changed the way I treated Molly. My door was always open for her, but she never changed the way she thought about me. She called me a trophy wife to my face. If I ever threw a charity event, she would remark “Wow, you’re so generous with dad’s money.” While she didn’t say anything explicitly, I could tell she looked down on me for not having a college degree.

A couple years ago, I made a final offering to Molly. I brought her into my closet and showed her the dress and accessories and told her I would love for her to wear them at her wedding. Some alterations would have to be done (I am 5’9 and a size 4, while Molly is 5’4 and a size 8), but we could make it work. Molly scoffed and said I had archaic values and that the dress was trashy, and walked out. That really hurt because she knew what that dress meant to me and she didn’t care. After that, I stopped making as much of an effort to build a relationship with her.

Two months ago, Mark proposed to his college sweetheart “Lucy,” with whom I have a great relationship. When Lucy mentioned dress shopping, I showed her my dress. Lucy tried it on and it fit like a glove. She fell in love with it, and I told her the dress, shoes, and accessories were hers. She was so happy she literally cried.

However, a couple days ago, Molly reached out to me out of the blue to ask if the dress was still available. I told her I had given it to Lucy. She asked if I could get it back from Lucy, since I offered it to her first, and I told her 1) she said she didn’t want it, 2) it fits Lucy perfectly, and 3) Lucy is the only one getting married within the foreseeable future.

Now Molly is saying I’m favoring Lucy over her because she’s conforming to traditional standards of femininity (getting married and being thin). That’s absolute baloney, but it got me thinking that if the roles were reversed and Lucy was the one asking for the dress after initially turning it down, would I give it to her? Is Molly right that I’m favoring Lucy? AITA?

UPDATE

Wow, thank you for all of your kind words! I wanted to give an update to respond to general questions and comments. First, I want to say that the fact that most of the comments are “NTA” is very reassuring. It makes me feel better about my decision to not give my dress to Molly.

I saw some comments suggesting this, so I would like to let you know I already gave the dress to Lucy and it’s safe in her apartment now. Molly has already been bugging Lucy about the dress, but Lucy told me there’s “no way in heck” she’s giving it away. Some of you have also been wondering about Mark and Rob’s responses. Mark is currently out of town on business and I have had no communication with him on this matter. I’m sure he’ll be supportive of Lucy though. I did not bring this up to Rob, because while Molly and I have a difficult relationship, I don’t want to sow division between her and her father. However, Rob brought it up last night, saying Molly had contacted him on the matter. Rob was like, “You aren’t going to give it to her, are you?” When I said no, he told me to promise him I would not give the dress to her. It was very comforting to know Rob is on my side.

Another thing I want to get clear, I do NOT expect Molly to conform to certain “standards.” When I referred to “traditional standards of femininity (getting married and being thin)”, I was paraphrasing words that came out of her mouth. I was raised in a traditional household, but I understand that a lot of women, especially young women, do not share my values. Frankly Lucy doesn’t either. She has an engineering degree and openly talks about wanting to prioritize her career over starting a family, at least for the foreseeable future, and I couldn’t be happier for her. I DO realize that I could have done a better job communicating to Molly that I don’t care what she does so long as she is a good person and she leaves the world better than she found it.

Lastly, because after reading the comments I fear I painted Molly in a bad light, I should say that Molly has had a rough life due to the divorce between Bob and her biological mother. I have never met her mother, and I don’t want to go into gross detail on the internet about someone’s life other than my own, but I will say that her relationship with her mother is not great. I think Molly might be projecting aspects of that relationship onto me. However, your comments have helped me realize she is in the wrong in this situation. I’ve also realized that it isn’t just on me to build a relationship with her–she has to work at it too, and so far she has not. I’m never going to shut her out, but at this point if she wants to connect with me, SHE has to be the one making the effort.

I’m never going to shut her out, but at this point if she wants to connect with me, SHE has to be the one making the effort.

I was 2-3 feet away from her when I was picking up my stuff from the top shelf when she looks up at me and starts shouting at me, saying that I have to wait for her to finish her work and only then, can I pick up whatever I need.

74,1eot2pe,AITA for telling my father he's no longer allowed to cook for my kids?,"My (30F) father (60s) shops like a doomsday prepper. Whenever he gets groceries, he buys enough to feed a family of 5. He's also the type to buy food he doesn't plan on eating anytime soon, ""just in case"" he craves it.

This has always been a problem. When I was younger, my sister and I spent more time at our mom's place, and weren't there often enough to eat much. Nowadays, he lives alone, so even less of what he buys is eaten. 

The result has always been the same: a lot of the food he buys ends up either spoiled or sitting in a freezer until the end of time. We've never eaten anything that's rotten or moldy, but my dad has always refused to listen when I tell him this is bad for his health.

My family went to his place for dinner about a week ago. I arrived earlier to help my father out, as he planned on making burgers. My husband would come later with our kids (5M and 2F).

I had offered to buy some burgers when we decided on them, but my father had said he had some at his place. I didn't think about what that could mean until I saw him pull a box of burgers and some cheese from the very bottom of the freezer. 

As both had clearly been there a while, I checked the expiration dates. The cheese expired in February (I know dairy products can last longer frozen, but still). The burgers expired in March 2021.

I asked my father if he actually planned on cooking that food. He said yes, as both were frozen and ""still fine"" to eat.

I told him I didn't care how edible he thought the food was, the meat was older than my daughter. We could think about something else to make or I could have my husband pick up some burgers on his way to my dad's place, but I didn't want my kids eating that.

My father got offended. He started going on about how the food was safe and how a dozen nutritionists (AKA some guys his girlfriend found on TikTok) had said so. He said he couldn't believe I didn't trust him.

He continued talking about how dramatic I was being for a while. I was very upset at the way he responded. Finally, I said: ""My kids aren't eating that, and I don't want you cooking for them again. Either (husband's name) buys the burgers or we're not staying for dinner.""

My husband ended up buying the burgers. We ate them peacefully and no one fought in front of the kids.

The next day, my father told me he was upset by what I'd said. He said he felt offended that I'd ""accuse him of putting his grandchildren in danger"" like that. I told him that wasn't my intention, I just didn't want to feed my kids 3 year old meat, and he refused to listen to me.

My dad's still insisting I'm being dramatic. My husband is completely on my side, but thinks forbidding my father from cooking for our children might have been a little too much.

75,1eosyzv,AITA for confronting my bf’s (19M) friends for being rude to me (19F)?,"My bf and I have been together since middle school. Before we started dating, I was already hanging out with him and his friends. Although they considered me a friend most of the time (directly stating it even), there were moments when I was excluded for being a girl or not knowing them as long. Still, we spent a lot of time together at school, hangouts, and playing video games—something we still do to this day.

Lately, however, some of my bf’s friends have started making rude jokes about me, saying things like ""Can I have the key to the chastity belt?"" or ""Did bf get permission to say that?"" The only other time I've seen something like this was when they made similar jokes about Jake’s gf, who is very rude and controlling.

The worst offenders are two guys I'll call Jake and Herman. Today, my bf was texting in our group chat, asking why Herman only joins us like once a week. Herman responded saying that “no way you’re talking” implying my bf needed permission to play and even saying I “ripped bf’s headset off” when we stopped playing earlier (when he wasn’t on). At that point, I'd had enough, telling them they were being assholes and pointing out that I'm more flexible than both of their gfs. I spend almost every day playing games with my bf and them, yet they were acting like I was super controlling. Even my bf was getting annoyed by them.

They laughed it off and said I was being ridiculous. I continued, calling out Herman for being obnoxious and highlighting the irony of him making such jokes when he barely plays because of his gf. My final, admittedly unrelated and rude comment to Herman was, ""I don't care what a guy who's trying to collect addictions like it’s Pokémon thinks.""

The group chat continued with more mocking, and my bf started getting upset—not with them, but with me. He said he had already talked to them about the issue, though this happened after I had already sent my initial message and they still ignored his wishes when he spoke to them. I started crying because of everyone ganging up on me, but instead of comforting me, my bf mocked me for crying and then expressed frustration over how ""stuff like this always happens,"" essentially blaming me for the situation. When I suggested he get better friends, he shot back that I don’t have any of my own.

For context, I’m currently in the process of getting an autism diagnosis, so it’s very hard for me to make friends

In the end, I told my bf that I’m tired of his friends ganging up on me, and I don’t want either of us to play games with them until they apologize.

For context, my sister (29f) and I (26f) recently got into a big fight about boundaries, it was basically about prioritizing my bf over her - meanwhile my bf felt that I prioritize my sister before him. My sister is my best friend but she tends to overdramatize things. Obviously I try my best so that she does not feel abandoned by me.

She had her birthday a few days ago (on Monday). Now, our big fight (my sister's protective bf and my stressed out bf involved) was on Friday, and on Saturday all four of us planned to go with some friends (all couples) on a trip. During the trip one of our friend wanted to surprise her and celebrate her birthday to which I gave some advice and we choose her birthday cake together.

After the fight we kind of made peace but we all left rather upset. My sister and her bf went on the trip anyway, but my bf refused to go, and in the end I also quietly declined since I was still hurt and partly because I did not want to be alone on the ""all couples trip"". And because my sister said during the fight that my bf and I were only invited to the trip because she asked the host kinda out of charity. Honestly I felt pretty bad about declining last minute but I had really no strength to be in a social situation and pretend that I am well; and to explain the others why my bf did not come. So I celebrated her birthday on Sunday just with our family. (This means that neither celebration took place on her birthday.)

When my sister found out that I knew about the Saturday birthday surprise, she was really hurt and made some passive agressive comments on it, implying that I am the AH for consciously not attending for which she feels like I am inconsiderate and do not care about her. I did apologise to her, but I was wondering that maybe I was indeed a selfish AH and I should have just been brave and gone on the trip anyway for my sister.

He’s never once complained or made a big deal out of anything, and honestly at this point I’m not even sure why he’s still with me - he’s well and truly drawn the short straw with me.
Today I asked him to buy me some flowers to cheer me up, and he sighed and rolled his eyes and seemed annoyed at my request, although he did say he would get them, but it was clear he didn’t really want to.
AITAH for asking for some flowers ? I feel maybe I’ve just pushed my luck a bit too far ?

79,1eorrp8,AITA For asking my sister-in-law to tell her child not to open the closet's door?,"Long-time lurker, first-time poster. Not a native speaker, so forgive any errors, and I'm still literally shaking.

So, My brother and her pregnant wife and her child (12M) from another relationship came for lunch to my mother's house. I live with her. After lunch her child went to my brother's room to play games in the phone. While there, I heard the noise of the closet door and I went to ask him to stop doing that. Then, I told my SIL the same, to please ask him not to do it.

I guess it was wrong, because first she said it wasn't on purpose. I exclaimed that it can't be ""not on purpose"". But she started crying and saying that she wasn't coming again and that she wanted to leave. I told her that I didn't meant that. I just wanted him to stop gossiping around (it wasn't the first time, he has a habit of touching things around and gossiping what's in the bookshelf there, once even telling us we should trash some things).

Now they left without a word, mom is half crying and not talking to me and I feel like trash and shaking because I just wanted a kid to stop gossiping inside a closet that's not his. 

AITA?


Edit: just to clarify some things I read. I meant snooping, not gossiping, not a native speaker, sorry.
I was raised to understand that this behaviour is not to be tolerated, so I reacted under the assumption that he should be taught the same.

About the bookshelf incident, he wasn't looking at books, there are some papers and other things there too, and he took a lighter.

I don't think he steals, as someone said. But he is sometimes disrespectful/rude in his answers, even to his own mom.

I have clothes there too, in another closet that doesn't make the same sound (it was like a ""clic""), long dresses that can only be hang there without being folded, and one was for a family wedding last month and expensive. I don't want it damaged.

I don't know my brother's side. They left in a rush. Everything took like 3 minutes. He talked with my mother, but I don't know more.

Mom agrees he's ill-mannered, but wants to keep the peace, and that maybe I was a bit harsh.

I saw some assumptions about their marriage. I don't know, they seem fine, it's all I can say. They've been together five years, married for one, so I guess everything it's ok and my brother doesn't look miserable. Not that I know them very well, we were introduced four months before the wedding.

I offered mom to move out (it's a multigenerational home, yes), she doesn't want me to, but I might do anyway, I don't want to be the reason she can't spend time with my brother or the baby.

80,1eor3dr,"AITA for refusing to let my daughter try and pursue swimming as a professional career by saying ""It's too late"" ?","Throwaway account and fake names.

I (45F) have two kids: Lara (16F) and Kian (14M). Both my kids take competitive swimming as a hobby, however, Lara is more athletically inclined than Kian is and takes swimming more seriously than he does. She has been to regional and state championships a few times since elementary school and has even gotten close to qualifying for nationals a year ago.

Recently, Lara came up to me and told me that she really looks up to athletes like Ian Thorpe, Emma Mckeon, Michael Phelps and other great swimming legends in Australia and across the globe. She is a huge Olympics fanatic like our family so I wasn't surprised at first. However, she then told me that she wanted to pursue swimming professionally, because in her words, she's made ""A lot of progress"" and thinks it's possible for her to get an Olympic quota if she keeps training hard. She also told me she really wants to represent Australia at the Olympics in the future and cannot live without swimming.

However, I shut her down really quickly after she said that. I told her that there's athletes younger than her already swimming at the Olympics in the preliminary stages and even at the finals. I reminded her that Michael Phelps was only 15 at his first Olympics and she didn't even qualify for nationals, before saying that it was a bit too late for her to try and pursue swimming professionally. I then reminded her how rigorous and strict the training regime was physically and mentally, how it was much more different than her swimming lessons. I also told her that she could put aside swimming until university and that education was much more effective than athleticism.

My daughter looked sad and nodded, before heading to her dad's room and I heard her crying in his room. After half an hour had passed, my husband came downstairs and confronted me by saying that what I had told my daughter was extremely cruel and put down her self esteem significantly. I retaliated back, saying that I was only expressing concern for Lara and that my concerns were realistic. After I told my husband my thoughts, we got into a bit of a dispute, because in my husband's words, my daughter's dreams were ""very realistic"" and that I ""shouldn't police my daughter's career autonomy"".

At some point my grandparents told him to cut the shit and get the talk over with. Dad said he didn't get why they were there. There was some back and forth before my grandparents told him they were tired of him forgetting he had a responsibility to me and not just his wife's kids, especially his wife's son.

My grandparents said it was all BS and he was excusing being a failure as a father. They said they had raised him to be better and do better. That my mom would be disgusted with him.

My husband (41M) has been away in Thailand for a month doing pilot training for a major airline. While I fully support his career goals, the situation has started to take a toll on me.

During this time, my husband has been going out drinking most nights, saying he needs to let off steam after a hard day. I don’t really mind that he’s enjoying his experience, but he has gone over our agreed budget while he was away. When I tried to express how this might feel disrespectful and unfair, especially since I’m at home working full time, taking care of our son, and managing the household, he dismissed my concerns. He justified his spending by saying that his income benefits the family. While that’s true, my income is still close to 40% of our total income, so it’s not like I’m not contributing significantly too. We also owe over $500k on our home loan, so every dollar counts.

The final straw was when he asked if he could join the airline’s club membership to make his time away easier. I said no because I’ve been sticking to our agreed budget strictly. I take my lunches to work every day and can’t do any socialising as I simply just don’t have the time. I’d love to have something like that to make my life easier, but I don’t have that option right now.

What makes it even harder is that when he’s home, I still have to do all the school runs, extracurricular activities, groceries, etc., because his car license has been suspended for 3 months. I feel like I’m shouldering the majority of the responsibilities, and he doesn’t seem to see that.

What hurts the most is that when I tried to explain how unvalued and unheard I feel, he brushed it off, saying I’m just upset because he’s having fun and I’m not. He doesn’t seem to understand that I’m the one at home, keeping our family together and making personal sacrifices so that he can live his dream job.

AITA for feeling resentful and saying no to the club membership, even though it might make his life easier?

85,1eoql7p,WIBTA if I said no to my parents moving into me and my husband’s house?,"
Hi Reddit, this will be a lengthy one, my apologies in advance but just wanted to give more context.

My husband and I recently got married in January 2024 and waiting to move into our own 3bedroom apartment that is still going through renovations that’s taking longer than expected. My husband moved into my dad’s 1 bedroom apartment after we got married as no one else has been living there except for me. I have also been paying rent ever since I started working.  

For context, my dad has been living in a rented semi detached house with my step mum and her mother ever since he remarried 7 years ago. They currently also have a male tenant living with them in the house who is rarely home due to his working hours. Also dad’s MIL owns a studio apartment that is currently vacant.

Few months ago, my dad came to us and told us that the owners of their rental house wants it back to undergo renovations and then renting it at a higher value, which my parents clearly cant afford. While my husband and I were house hunting, we brought it up to my dad and offered to let them stay with us and at no cost.

Hi Reddit, this will be a lengthy one, my apologies in advance but just wanted to give more context.

My husband and I recently got married in January 2024 and waiting to move into our own 3bedroom apartment that is still going through renovations that’s taking longer than expected. My husband moved into my dad’s 1 bedroom apartment after we got married as no one else has been living there except for me. I have also been paying rent ever since I started working.  

For context, my dad has been living in a rented semi detached house with my step mum and her mother ever since he remarried 7 years ago. They currently also have a male tenant living with them in the house who is rarely home due to his working hours. Also dad’s MIL owns a studio apartment that is currently vacant.

Few months ago, my dad came to us and told us that the owners of their rental house wants it back to undergo renovations and then renting it at a higher value, which my parents clearly cant afford. While my husband and I were house hunting, we brought it up to my dad and offered to let them stay with us and at no cost. He declined as he said my step mum would not feel comfortable having to live with another guy at close proximity(my husband), it’s too far from her siblings and the city centre and she is used to living in landed properties so an apartment would be too small for her. We also offered to move out of his house so that they can move in but he declined as there is only one bedroom and her mum insists on following my step mum wherever she goes, even though she has her own home.

86,1eoqbjn,WIBTA for telling my uncle to get over himself?,"Long time reader, first time AITA poster. Hopefully this formats right as I’m on my phone!!

Today is my uncle’s 65th birthday so I sent him a message this morning that says “Happy birthday uncle. Hope you're able to do something nice today. Love from *me* *my husband* and the very soon to be baby” 

Wasn’t expecting a reply as the last three messages I’ve sent him have all gone unanswered. But then he replied this “Yeah right. Join the rest of your family and forget about me.”

Being nearly 37 weeks pregnant I’m a tad emotional so I burst into tears at that and was so confused. For context I have sent the following messages since Christmas 

1. A message saying merry Christmas last year (to which he replied thanks, atleast I got one from my caring family…)
2. A message in February apologising for missing his call as I was at the airport. Since then we have spoken on the phone twice
3. A message in April checking in on him - no reply
4. A message in June checking in - again no reply

After his last message today I sent back this “Not sure where that has come from - I've tried to include you and get shut down at every turn. 
Invited you to my wedding - nope. 
Invited to *brothers* wedding - nope. 
Messaged you and get no reply, and now wish you a happy birthday and get it thrown in my face. 
Balls in your court now - you are always welcome here but it's up to you to make the next move. 
You're out of line and have well over stepped your mark.”

He then called me an arsehole and said “like I said thanks and goodbye.”

Our parents were always generous with giving money when asked for it, except when it was me. I was told I should learn to work hard. I was told I didn't *need* the new video game or toy. I was told earning money was the only way I'd ever have money and I hadn't earned money from them. But my siblings could get whatever they wanted. When I first graduated college I ended up struggling financially because where I went to work, the cost of apartments were so high. I asked my parents if they could help me out and they said no. I ended up in a shelter for a few weeks and then rented a dump of an apartment with a friend who found himself in the same situation.

They not only helped my siblings through college, which they didn't do for me, but they gave each of them lump sums after they graduated to help them get started in life. They also helped them out when asked over the years. During Covid years especially.

They didn't offer any money to help toward mine and my wife's wedding. We didn't ask. But it stood out more when my sister (28f) got engaged and our parents had mentioned money for ""all the weddings"". Again, it was all except for mine.

Only now this has all caught up with them and they are in a very tight spot with money. They're asking me for money too. They told me they need our (mine and my wife's) help and we should do it because of how great they have been and they never say no to any of us. I told them they never helped me with shit. That they preferred to see me homeless rather than help me out. They argued back that it never happened and I could have asked if things were that bad. I showed them screenshots of texts where I had brought the topic up after asking them verbally. My parents dismissed it and then told me they're still my parents and I'm the most settled and I could afford to help them.

I admitted that I could. But I didn't feel they had earned it.

My parents called me spiteful and said I should help my parents rather than see them lose everything. I told them to ask the kids who they helped. My siblings were also pissed I said no. They told me mom and dad don't deserve my pettiness.

I usually laugh it off, taking it as a joke or whatever. Then, two weeks ago, my spouse said to me, quite directly, after I got home from a boozy Saturday afternoon picnic in the park with a friend where we had mimosas and snacks, reading and writing poetry, that ""You seem to be drinking a lot lately.""

So, this coming from my spouse made it click in my head, and since then, I haven't touched a single drop of alcohol. Okay, it's only been two weeks, but it isn't hard, or a struggle. I'm not ""trying"" to not drink alcohol: I simply stopped. But now, since then, those same people are acting annoyed at me for NOT drinking when we're hanging out together. ""Why aren't you drinking?"" ""But we're all having some wine"" ""What's the problem?"" etc. And my spouse especially is acting like I'm in some way insulting them or spiting them for saying something.

When we spoke about it this morning, they said asked me ""How long are you going to keep this up?"" and I replied ""Until you apologise"" which made them angry and they started speaking in a really agitated tone and raised voice. ""I'm not going to apologise for my opinion."" they said, which I agree with. I'm not avoiding drinking to spite them: I am avoiding drinking until they realise that it isn't true that I have a drinking problem.

They are all acting like I'm being spiteful or something, which I don't think I am. In response to a concern that I drink a lot, I stopped drinking. If that concern disappears, then I will (be able to) start drinking again...

90,1eoolie,AITA for going to get myself food after taking my mom to the hospital?,"Hi, I think this situation has really blown out of proportion, but I need outside input.

I (36f) have been seeing this guy (25m). We are in a LDR; he's from Texas, I'm from Canada. (Yes, I am genuinely starting to question my sanity for dating so young. This isn't the main issue, please be kind. xD)

A few days ago, my mom (70f) started feeling unwell. This morning, I took her to the hospital. As soon as we got in to see the doctor, they gave her IV anti-nausea meds and some painkillers. The doctor thought it might be her gallbladder, but all tests were clear and the painkillers helped, so she was discharged with some heavy anti-nausea meds. We were told that if it persists to come back asap.

Once home, she had some tea and toast and crawled into bed to rest. Since the painkillers were still in effect, I thought it'd be safe to grab some fast food less than a five minute walk from our place. I told her I'd go after she fell asleep, but to call in case she needed me and I'd rush home. I left and came back without her noticing; I was gone for maybe 20 minutes. I ate/slept, and when I woke to check on her she said she may need to go back as the symptoms have returned.

My S/O seems to think my judgement can't be trusted because I left the house while l exhausted; for unrelated reasons, this isn't the first time said that. Sure, I was exhausted, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to care for myself. I did not want to cook after spending hours in the hospital, but he seems to think something ""bad"" could have happened because I was exhausted. 

I'm an only child and live with my mom, so it's my responsibility to keep her purse/info safe while she's resting in the hospital and waiting to see the doctor. Mom was fine with me leaving to get food; she couldn't have cared less. I think she's probably happier I did it the way I did than pay for overpriced hospital food.

I was taught that you eat/sleep when the person you're caring for eats/sleeps, which is exactly what I did. Should we have needed to go back to the hospital earlier than anticipated, being hungry and tired would have ""impeded my judgement"" more than going to the store while exhausted.

My S/O is now saying he cares less about ""us"" after I told him off for trying to say I was wrong for leaving the house, and is playing the victim by saying he won't bring up how he feels anymore, which is frequent and feels more like criticism/control than concern - another story for another time. He believes it's poor judgement to ""go out in public not in a clear mind and well rested"" and that something ""bad"" (undefined by him) could have happened to me? Nothing I have said has gotten him to let up about this situation, and he still thinks how I handled feeding myself proves I have poor judgement.

Meanwhile, my trooper of a mom is finally asleep and snoring peacefully. Hopefully the second trip to the hospital won't be needed!

The reason was infidelity on MILs part and the whole thing tore his family apart. A big argument broke out and it resulted in OH and his siblings cutting ties with MIL. This led to them confessing that MIL had quite the temper and would occasionally turn to physical force and emotional manipulation during arguments.

A couple of years later we sadly lost my mother to cancer. And a year later we got engaged and this led to us having a big conversation about MIL. In the end we agree to tell her about our engagement and attempt to rebuild bridges. We did this and succeeded. OH rebuilt a wonderful relationship with MIL and she came to our wedding.

My MIL supported us through a lot over the next few years. She was a shoulder to cry on during infertility, I would phone her in tears any time it really got to me, especially when friends were all announcing their own pregnancies. She supported me through all the pregnancy stuff despite going through cancer treatment for herself at the time. We were so close that OH and I agreed to tell her about the pregnancy first when I was only about 5 weeks. The support was mutual, we were taking her to hospital for her treatments and were both (daily) an ear to chew about the diagnosis despite having lost my mother to cancer a few years prior. We both put our feelings to one side to support her. Then once baby was born (c-section) and we were home she was basically my entire support network. Whenever I needed her day or night she was there. I probably spoke to her every day from the point OH and I got engaged.

So fast forward to present day. Another big family argument broke out where the past was all dug back up again and the treatment they had received as teenagers was bought up in the argument. My MIL tried to defend her actions by suggesting that it was self defense which obviously angered everyone who had been subject to it and OH immediately made the decision to go no contact once again because she did not acknowledge her actions.

I thought this was a bit of a heat of the moment thing and he would calm down and they could talk it through after but we are now a week later and he still has no interest in ever seeing her or hearing from her ever again.

I feel like she was great support to us and in 1 big argument everything has been thrown away and our child has lost out on the relationship they had with their grandmother.

After realising that OH has no intention of talking the situation through with her I began grieving mine and my child's relationship with my MIL. I had a conversation with OH where I told him that I respect his decision but I don't agree with it. He said that if I want to maintain a relationship with her I can but he has no interest in rebuilding bridges again. And if I do, be careful.

I’m not a cheater, but I did noticed I loved being around my friend. One day my gf blindsided me in an argument on WhatsApp and blocked me, thanks to my friend I was able not to run after her. Detail, this was the 10th time she blocked me and although I shed a large amount of tears, I just let her go this time. In the meanwhile, me and that other friend kept getting closer and at some point I confessed feelings for her. She reacted shocked, told me she had a lot on her plate as she’s an immigrant from Venezuela and the political situation over there is critical. She did promise we’d talk about this, I told her I would have an answer but I do respect her situation. I’ve seen her only two times ever since, once on a date where she completely treated me as “the friend” and even laughed at me when I made an extra manoeuvre to park my car (I was driving a replacement). Yesterday we sent out with friends where she said a few words but completely ignored me afterwards, I felt completely friendzoned, treated like the safe option, I just couldn’t take that anymore and walked off. She didn’t send a message, I’m not looking for drama but a “hey where are you?” would have been appreciated.

So with coming out of a bad relationship and falling for someone else my judgement is clouded, did I act like an asshole?

93,1eong4p,AITA for telling my SIL to f-off when she showed me “proof” of my partners affair?,"I (32f) have been in a relationship with Marcus (34m) for 11 years.

Marcus has a sister (Maya, 36f) who recently went through divorce.  Maya is a hard person to deal with.  She’s a contrarian, she’s hot headed, stubborn, and easily offended.  Up until now I’ve managed to be the bigger person, and keep the peace between all of us.  Most of his family does the same with her.  All that changed when I got a text from her yesterday. The text was kind and supportive it seemed:

“Hi OP…. I’m so sorry to give you this news, but Marcus has been cheating on you, and it’s been going on for years.”  She continued to say that she found proof of his affair, she has the ss and then said that I MUST leave him immediately, that she is going through divorce too and she’s glad to have a “friend” with the same issues, (shes divorcing for very different issues) and she will help me pack my shit and get out tonight.  She gave me info for an attorney, and a shelter and attached a ss of a tinder profile belonging to Marcus, years old, but still active. 

My response, you might ask? “Did you speak to Marcus about this?”  Of course she hadn’t, she came only to me, telling me exactly what I “needed” to do because she’s going through the “exact same thing.”

The thing is, Marcus and I have always had a somewhat open relationship. I’m bi, and often invite a third into our sex life. I’m WELL aware of his tinder profile and sit next to him giving input while he swipe. I said  won’t be leaving Marcus and that she should speak to him.

She refused, and told me since I don’t want to leave him it must mean I’m brain washed and abused and need help.

[Edit: After texting Marcus] I  explained our “arrangement” vaguely. Her response was that she “didn’t know” and that it’s disgusting, and then she accused me of lying, then SHOWED UP at my house and brought bags to pack my stuff.  

I lost it.  I told her to stop making assumptions, to stop trying to blow up my life, and stop projecting her issues and beliefs on me. And then I told her to fuck off and get the hell away from me, and my property.   She went home and told the family about our arrangement and that I was crazy.

When Marcus came back home he told me I could have handled the situation better, I didn’t need to snap or kick her out, and should have simply explained again, and held my emotions better, because now our whole family knows our private business.  If I hadn’t pissed Maya off we could have worked it out with less drama.  He’s not wrong…. But I am not sure I was wrong either.  I felt like she was deliberately trying to fuck up my life.  Her intentions may have been good, but once I explained and she continued to tell me what I “should” do, I was pissed off.

So, should I have kept the peace?

95,1eonbqc,AITA for removing my friend from my ‘Close Friends’ story on IG?,"
I (24F) moved to a new country about seven months ago and met a girl (27F) during a fire drill. We hit it off and started hanging out once or twice a week. While I enjoy her company, I haven't gotten close to her emotionally because she can be negative, like pointing out my grey hairs or taking off-guard photos of me. Plus, our goals don’t really align—I'm focused on building my career, which she doesn't seem to understand.

About a month ago, she noticed I didn’t have her in my Instagram close friends and asked me to add her. I did, even though I usually reserve that for people back home or those I’m closer to. Later, I removed her again, and she confronted me about it. I explained that it wasn’t personal; I just wanted to share specific posts with my friends back home.

Since then, she’s been on annual leave and has become clingy, constantly asking to hang out, which is tough since I work from home. She even tells me to stop working so hard, which I find frustrating. I recently removed her from my close friends again because her constant questions and attention were making me feel suffocated. Now, she’s gone radio silent which I don’t mind as I needed the space anyways.

96,1eon4sj,AITA for asking my sister what she means by what she said?,"We were discussing the Olympics and she brought up the Turkish shooter, Yusuf Dikec. 

She said she felt bad for his wife who divorced him before the Olympics (don't know how far back) and how she must be getting a lot of unwanted and negative attention from the community because the Turkish community is similar to ours and would probably talk behind her back about she missed such a good man etc etc. 

Seems like a normal empathetic thing to say but she was smiling the entire time. I didn't really understand what she meant by that, was she joking or serious or what. And I asked her.

I asked her if she really felt bad, she said yes. ""But you're smiling, so are you feeling bad? I don't get it"" I don't struggle with tone like that normally, though I do have some trouble with deciphering facial emotions, especially with people I'm not familiar with.

She stops smiling and asks what's wrong with me. In her words, I was trying to get some kind of a reaction from her. I wasn't, but she said my tone was off. 

I really don't understand, she said she felt bad but she was smiling and I feel like even if she was joking, it's a shitty thing to do because she knows how our community gets and to enjoy a woman getting her life disturbed is weird. 

She complained to our mom today, said I kept on trying to get a reaction out of her. My mom said I was wrong and I'll grow out of it, but it was because I isolate myself a lot and I'm always in my room. 

My parents are the ones who isolated me. We separated from our joint family when I was really young.

97,1eompc4,AITA for breaking up with my boyfriend over a movie? ,"My boyfriend (26m) and I (24f) just went to go see It Ends With Us in theaters. SPOILER ALERT if you haven’t read it or seen the movie. 

It was an amazing film, I read the book as well so I already felt attached to the story and I decided to take my boyfriend to see it. He knew before we saw it how much I liked the book. 

Afterwards, he made a joke along the lines of “wow she really had two options the whole time” implying the main character Lily had a choice between Atlas and Ryle and was stringing both of them along? He doubled down when I said “that’s not true” and said “well she ran to Atlas when Ryle started hurting her”- 

Here’s why this upset me: 
If you haven’t seen the movie, Ryle is physically abusive to Lily the whole time they are together. She ends up marrying him anyways and after things get really bad, she finally leaves. Lily of course has a hard time recognizing the abuse because she loves Ryle and it’s hard to recognize how screwed up a situation is when you truly believe the person you love would never hurt you. 

Atlas was her first love and treated her very well and he resurfaces around the time Lily starts dating Ryle. 

The point of the movie is to juxtapose Ryle and Atlas in a way that shows that Ryle is the type of love women often think they deserve or will settle for (controlling, manipulating, abusive) where as Atlas is the kind of love we actually deserve, the kind that loves us for who we are, wants the best for us, supports us, etc. and will be constant. 

Making a comment about Lily having “options” implies she did something wrong or that she had a back up plan the whole time. This isn’t the case. She chose Ryle, she loved him, and she would have stayed, but she was strong enough to recognize the abuse and leave. Atlas happened to be there to pick up the pieces and to love her the way she needed. But she never wanted things to end between her and Ryle. 

I think it’s sexist to say she had “options” because it implies that SHE did something wrong. 

Idk the whole thing upset me and we got into a really bad argument. This isn’t the first comment he’s made that’s bothered me, so I think it might be over.

104,1eolbqu,AITA for not trying to bond with my FIL?,"My (21F) boyfriend (22M) and I have been dating for over a year. We have a very healthy and happy relationship. His family was very sweet from the start and always tried to make me feel at home and ""one of them"". For my part, I never felt quite comfortable (they are super close while my family is a lot more distant, + I have social anxiety) but I still made my best effort to fit in and have the best relationship possible with them. 

About 6 months ago his dad's (48M) attitude towards me started to change. Suddenly there's tension, distasteful/offensive ""jokes"" here and there, no conversation, and he overall acts as if he doesn't want me there most of the time.
Turns out he expected me to become like another daughter and to be as close with him as he is with his kids, and feels rejected because ""I didn't try"".

This is a very big ask for me. I never had any type of relationship with my dad and ended up learning to thrive without it. I also spent my teenage years running from the ""daughter role"" and dreaming of the day I would be considered an adult, an equal. 
For context, FIL's relationship with his kids is very ""child - father figure"", even though both his children are adults.
So, I have no intention or interest in putting myself in that role again, and even if I wanted to, I wouldn't know how to. 

FIL has been told about my family's history and dynamics and says he understands but keeps treating me badly, and it's starting to really get to me. 
Up until now I was actually trying my best to bond with him, even though I didn't feel comfortable at all, because my boyfriend adores him. 

Now I have grown to resent him for mistreating me, and I've given up on trying to make him like me. Every day that passes I dislike him more and more.

107,1eokzig,AITA: I blocked my summer fling over a prank she played on me ,"I (19 M) had a summer fling with, we’ll call her Maria, (F 18). Her and I met at the beginning of summer and due to us going to colleges 12+ hours away from each other, we decided that we were just going to have a summer fling as opposed to anything serious. 

Everything was fine for the first two months however, problems started to arise around mid July. I felt disrespected by her due to reasons such as constantly telling me to shut up, taking anger out on me even tho I did nothing wrong, and saying how a male celebrity could “have her babies” to my face. She was overall pretty caring and did put in effort to see me, talk to me, etc. so I gave her the benefit of the doubt in these situations.

Today was the last day before I go back to college and she was going to a party. She drove to said party and made it seem like she had gotten drunk by saying “I drank” and “I had more than one shot” (after previously stating she only had one shot). I begged her not to drive home and she just shoved it off and said her house was only 2 minutes away and she would be fine. 

I started to freak out and begged her not to and made it very known I didn’t want her doing it. I even contacted a close friend of Maria’s who dislikes me heavily to try to get them to convince Maria to not do it. Maria then sends me photos on Snapchat of her behind the wheel stating “it’s fine” and “she’s really close.” 

I was very upset and confronted her about it and she changed her story multiple times. She says she was drunk, then only tipsy, then sober, then drunk, and keeps changing it. She eventually ends up implying that she was drunk so I tell her how messed up I think it is to drunk drive. She then claims she actually wasn’t drunk and that she only had a little bit of alcohol and then I told her how she made it seem like she was drunk on purpose and she claims she didn’t do so on purpose. 

I then call her out on it and say that it was certainly on purpose and now she’s playing dumb to me, hoping I don’t catch on, which she admits to. She then says she’s really sorry and didn’t think it would be such a big deal. I tell her she’s a “fucking asshole” and block her on everything.

111,1eojeqv,AITA for not Comforting My Cousin?,"I need a reality check because my coworkers are on my side and my mom is adamant I'm in the wrong.  

I am prefacing this by saying my cat is okay.  She was assessed, given fluids, and it doesn't seem like there will be lasting effects for which I am so grateful. 

I go on vacation every year.  During this time I pay my cousin, to check in on my cat.  Cousin lives within very close walking distance.  

I left earlier than my household this year as they had an event, came back, and then joined me.  Before I left I confirmed that my cat was in my room, set out multiple bowls of food and water and completely changed her litter box.  

I left on Saturday around 11am and returned around 5pm on Tuesday.  I asked Cousin to check in on my cat and give her fresh water.  Normally Cousin sends pictures or videos as my cat is quite friendly.  This time I didn't get any communication until Tuesday morning saying she hadn't seen my cat but there was evidence she was about.  I thought it off but gave my cousin the benefit of the doubt.  

Got home to find food bowls full and no evidence of my cat having used her box.  I started panicking and searching the house because she's 15.  I finally found her shut in the living room.  As best as I can figure, she was accidentally shut in when my household left around 5pm on Saturday.  I ensured my cat got the care she needed before updating anyone.  Her health and well being was/is my top priority.  I can understand how she got accidentally shut in the living room as she normally doesn't go in there.

What I am not understanding of is why Cousin, who has been watching my cat for years, didn't report the oddness of not seeing her until the day I was coming home.  Given that there wasn't evidence ""my cat was about"" I'm inclined to believe she never came by and lied about it.  I am extremely angry and stuck to curt but not rude texts with Cousin.  She called my mom crying that I'm mad at her and my mom called to chew me out about not reassuring my cousin and absolving her of guilt.  

When I showed up to work on Wednesday I was a mess and couldn't stop crying, mostly because I hadn't slept to keep checking on my cat.  I work in the pet care industry so my coworkers were also upset by this and my boss took pity on me and sent me home.  I am angry that my cousin didn't properly check on my cat, which would have spared her days of going without food and water.  I am also angry with my mother for insisting I'm in the wrong and that my cousin is the real victim in all this.  

As much as I am relieved that my cat is going to be okay, I am very angry she suffered at all.  But my head feels twisted with my mom insisting I'm in the wrong.  I'm hoping for neutral, third party viewpoints on whether I'm justified or it was just a series of accidents.  Am I'm being unreasonable because I, and my coworkers, have a professional level of care as the expectation?

",Not the A-hole,2024-08-10,"AITA for not Comforting My Cousin? I need a reality check because my coworkers are on my side and my mom is adamant I'm in the wrong.  

I am prefacing this by saying my cat is okay.  She was assessed, given fluids, and it doesn't seem like there will be lasting effects for which I am so grateful. 

I go on vacation every year.  During this time I pay my cousin, to check in on my cat.  Cousin lives within very close walking distance.  

I left earlier than my household this year as they had an event, came back, and then joined me.  Before I left I confirmed that my cat was in my room, set out multiple bowls of food and water and completely changed her litter box.  

I left on Saturday around 11am and returned around 5pm on Tuesday.  I asked Cousin to check in on my cat and give her fresh water.  Normally Cousin sends pictures or videos as my cat is quite friendly.  This time I didn't get any communication until Tuesday morning saying she hadn't seen my cat but there was evidence she was about.  I thought it off but gave my cousin the benefit of the doubt.  

Got home to find food bowls full and no evidence of my cat having used her box.  I started panicking and searching the house because she's 15.  I finally found her shut in the living room.  As best as I can figure, she was accidentally shut in when my household left around 5pm on Saturday.  I ensured my cat got the care she needed before updating anyone.  Her health and well being was/is my top priority.  I can understand how she got accidentally shut in the living room as she normally doesn't go in there.

What I am not understanding of is why Cousin, who has been watching my cat for years, didn't report the oddness of not seeing her until the day I was coming home.  Given that there wasn't evidence ""my cat was about"" I'm inclined to believe she never came by and lied about it.  I am extremely angry and stuck to curt but not rude texts with Cousin.  She called my mom crying that I'm mad at her and my mom called to chew me out about not reassuring my cousin and absolving her of guilt.

112,1eojda3,AITA for calling out my friend on her hostile and negative behaviour?,"My friend Alyssa went through a breakup in February (6 months ago) after her boyfriend of 2 years cheated on her. When she was in the relationship, me and my friends hardly saw her as he took up most of her time and she prioritised him as most people do and therefore, we didn’t consider her one of our closest friends but still a friend. However, since the breakup she has become a part of our lives again more often, which we understood as we wanted to help her through this difficult and hurtful situation. As time has gone on, we feel as though she is over the initial hurt of the breakup and moving on with her life yet something in her has significantly changed. She got herself involved in another friend group besides ours, people we have known for years and do not agree with their behaviour, morals and opinions. This seems to have really taken a tole on Alyssa as despite no longer surrounding herself with these lowlifes and incels for lack of a better word, she is still displaying the same behaviour we have known for them to do. She is constantly judging people whether that be on their looks, lifestyles or anything else she can nitpick at. She has called people she doesn’t even know “ugly bitches” and told people to “kill themselves” (not to their faces but to us which has made us all as a friend group extremely uncomfortable). Her language is vulgar, explosive and hateful - and it is constant and draining. She always talks about the old friend group and joins in when we say they are bad people who nobody should be around, yet still stalks them on social media and updates us on their lives which we don’t want to know about. She also seems to have an obsession with lying or withholding information from people in the group almost to give herself some sort of excitement like she used to have in the old friend group which was constantly full of drama and fall outs. This is something we are not used to, don’t tolerate and we have made hints for the past 4 months that we don’t like this but she will not stop. We are getting to the point where we don’t want to be around her as she is draining, negative and always manages to sway the conversation back to her hateful narrative despite all of our efforts to try and bring her back to herself. It almost seems like this is the real her now and we just never knew. Does this behaviour sound reversible because we are running out of ways to approach the situation?

114,1eoj9fg,AITA for not minding my own business when I saw a dog in a hot car?,"It was around 3 pm when I left McDonald's. The temperature was around 91°F. On my way to my car, I heard a dog barking. I looked around and spotted a small dog alone in a navy-colored car. The car was parked in direct sunlight, but all four windows were halfway down (not all the way down).

""Even with the windows open, it's still way too hot,"" I thought. ""I wouldn't want to be stuck in that car for even five minutes.""

I was worried. I wasn't sure if it was illegal to leave a dog in a car like that, so I did a quick online search. I found a website that said it was legal to remove a dog from a car if you believed the animal was in danger.  But the windows were halfway down. Was the dog really in danger?

Just then, I noticed someone get into the car parked next to the one with the dog. He just sat there, not driving away. I wondered if he was also concerned, but his windows were tinted, so I couldn't tell.

I kept an eye on both cars, trying to decide on the right thing to do. Finally, the driver of the other car rolled down his window.

""Hey,"" I said, ""I'm worried about that dog left in the hot car. Are you concerned too?""

""No,"" he replied. ""The windows are down, the dog's fine.""

His response didn't reassure me.

""You're being creepy,"" he said. ""The windows are down; the dog is okay.""

I was shocked. I was just worried about the dog. I hadn't even touched the car.

""You're the creepy one,"" he continued. ""Are you trying to steal the dog?""

Now I was irritated. I didn't think his hostility was justified. I turned away and disengaged from him.

I looked up the number for the local police station and called. I wanted to get their advice. The officer listened and then transferred me to dispatch.

While I was talking to dispatch, four people walked toward the car with the dog. Two of them were children.

""Hey,"" I said to them, ""you shouldn't leave your dog in the car like that.""

They didn't respond to me and started speaking to the guy in the next car in Spanish.

I felt the dog was no longer in immediate danger, so I updated the dispatcher and then walked away, got into my car, and drove off.

We both agree neither of us handled the situation well but I was still the bigger ass and will work on CALMLY getting through these things in the future. 

--

My teen (17f) went to a friend's house tonight, using my truck to do so. This was their first time driving the truck more than just on our property, but they've been in it, literally, hundreds of times in the last two years.

When they were ready to leave home, I asked them how much fuel the truck had in it.

When they said they didn't know, I walked over, looked at the guage with them IN the driver's seat and asked ""How much is in the other tank?"" while flipping the tank switch between the tanks.

They watched me do this...or should have been watching since they were IN the driver's seat. This switch is directly next to the steering wheel and they appeared to be looking at what I was doing.

I have mentioned to them many times in the past that when putting fuel in the truck, make sure you put at least a little in the second tank, just in case, and to switch between the tanks every other fill-up to keep all the lines and filters working and clear. The fact that this truck has 2 fuel tanks is NOT a secret and never has been.

On their way home, they ran out of fuel in one of the tanks, calling home in a panic. I asked them if they switched tanks. They had not. Once they did, everything was fine.

When they got home, after a minute or two of discussion about how their evening was, I asked them why they didn't try switching tanks before panicking. They said they didn't know they had to, I didn't tell them they had to switch tanks after putting fuel in.

I asked them which tank they put fuel into, they said they did not know, I'd never told them which tank to put fuel into, they just put it into one of them and left the station.

I began to get frustrated with them as I felt they were blaming me for the fact that they ""didn't know"" what to do in this situation even though I had, repeatedly, mentioned the dual tanks, the switch and the fact that you have to occasionally switch tanks.

When they kept saying ""You didn't tell me"" or ""I don't know"" about the dual tanks, which one they put fuel into and the switch I have repeatedly told them about, I snapped and, admittedly in a very frustrated tone and volume, asked them ""How bright do you REALLY have to be to realize you need to switch tanks to the one you put the gas into or to hit the switch that changes tanks if it runs out? Come on. Don't make ME do ALL the thinking for you! I don't mind helping you out and and then, but damn, use your brain!""

They went to their room and its been chilly in the house ever since.

I feel bad for snapping, but not for the idea behind what I said. I feel they were trying to put the ""blame"" on running out of gas on me, not themselves for their lack of doing the simple task of swapping between the tanks...which they've been told about more than once.

My teen (17f) went to a friend's house tonight, using my truck to do so. This was their first time driving the truck more than just on our property, but they've been in it, literally, hundreds of times in the last two years.

When they were ready to leave home, I asked them how much fuel the truck had in it.

When they said they didn't know, I walked over, looked at the guage with them IN the driver's seat and asked ""How much is in the other tank?"" while flipping the tank switch between the tanks.

They watched me do this...or should have been watching since they were IN the driver's seat. This switch is directly next to the steering wheel and they appeared to be looking at what I was doing.

I have mentioned to them many times in the past that when putting fuel in the truck, make sure you put at least a little in the second tank, just in case, and to switch between the tanks every other fill-up to keep all the lines and filters working and clear. The fact that this truck has 2 fuel tanks is NOT a secret and never has been.

On their way home, they ran out of fuel in one of the tanks, calling home in a panic. I asked them if they switched tanks. They had not. Once they did, everything was fine.

When they got home, after a minute or two of discussion about how their evening was, I asked them why they didn't try switching tanks before panicking. They said they didn't know they had to, I didn't tell them they had to switch tanks after putting fuel in.

I asked them which tank they put fuel into, they said they did not know, I'd never told them which tank to put fuel into, they just put it into one of them and left the station.

I began to get frustrated with them as I felt they were blaming me for the fact that they ""didn't know"" what to do in this situation even though I had, repeatedly, mentioned the dual tanks, the switch and the fact that you have to occasionally switch tanks.

When they kept saying ""You didn't tell me"" or ""I don't know"" about the dual tanks, which one they put fuel into and the switch I have repeatedly told them about, I snapped and, admittedly in a very frustrated tone and volume, asked them ""How bright do you REALLY have to be to realize you need to switch tanks to the one you put the gas into or to hit the switch that changes tanks if it runs out? Come on. Don't make ME do ALL the thinking for you! I don't mind helping you out and and then, but damn, use your brain!""

They went to their room and its been chilly in the house ever since.

I feel bad for snapping, but not for the idea behind what I said. I feel they were trying to put the ""blame"" on running out of gas on me, not themselves for their lack of doing the simple task of swapping between the tanks...which they've been told about more than once.

120,1eoi2vq,WIBTA for telling my dad I NEVER want to meet his girlfriend?,"Basically what's on the can. My (18F) dad (50M) wants me and my brothers to meet his affair partner 'Rachel' (hopefully 30<F) of around one year. He asked one of my brothers (15M) and I about it a while back actually, but it keeps replaying in my mind. My dad looked visibly disappointed and a bit upset that we said we didn't want to meet Rachel, but just thinking about that woman makes me go a bit ballistic and also makes me want to cry. It wouldn't end well. He told us that he respected our decision 'for now', but we would have to see her eventually as we were both a part of his life, and he would like not to keep them separate forever, but in all honesty, I could live the rest of my life happily never speaking to her. She does make him happy though, which I can't resent in itself.

I've had people tell me that I'd be TA for denying my dad the happiness of having us all come together and play happy families with Rachel, but I've also had a fair share of people (admittedly the majority being my own friends) telling me that I am right to feel this way about her, so I'm getting a mixed reception here. A strong part of me wants to get a grip and tell my dad on no uncertain terms that I never want anything to do with the woman, but another part of me is terrified about the consequences of what that type of confrontation would lead to.

Knowing me and my brother, we would either give her the silent treatment the whole time or start screaming at her, and neither of those are situations I would want to expose my youngest brother (11M) to. I'm just a little lost on what to think or do, because despite everything my dad's done to my mum (50F), I still love him and care about his feelings. I can't see a way meeting Rachel would end without someone crying, be it my dad, my mum, Rachel, my brothers, or myself.

Any advice would be appreciated, and please be brutally honest in telling me whether or not I'd be the asshole if I told my dad that I don't want to see her, full stop. Or tell me whether or not I'm the asshole for not having done so already. I think he's hopeful that we'll eventually change our minds

**Edit: To answer a few reoccurring questions**

**What do I mean by affair partner?** I mean, the woman my dad had a physical and emotional relationship with while still married to my mum. I didn't think that this would be something I had to specify?

**Why am I only angry at Rachel, and not at my dad?** At no point did I say I wasn't angry at him. I'm furious at him, I just also love him. I do not love Rachel. Hence why I am willing to see my dad, but not her. I am aware that they are together guilty in this, and that still seeing him at all could imply I forgive him for what he has done (which I haven't). It keeps me up at night

**Why would I 'betray my mother' by still seeing him?** My mum has strongly encouraged that we have a relationship with him. She would be horrified if she saw that comment. She doesn't want her feelings about him to influence ours, and definitely doesn't want her children to not have a dad at all. He may have been an awful husband, but he's not a bad father. She knows how never seeing him again would affect us all, but especially my youngest brother. He's only 11, and shouldn't be going through any of this

**The age gap**. Trust me, I know. I am painfully aware

124,1eoh6p0,AITA for blaming my parents for my bad allergies/ill health ,"So I'm 21 and about to enter my last year of college. My parents kicked me out of my bedroom my freshman year so my sisters didn't have to share anymore. When I came back from the dorms for break they offered me the coach. I ended up staying with my grandmother who had a bedroom for me. This pissed my parents off and they cleared out the basement for me. 

Besides mice in the winter it wasn't bad. However two years later my allergies can't handle it anymore. The washer/dryer are down there so it gets very humid. Theres also a heat wave and lack of windows which isn't helping. They leave wet clothes hanging on the door, on the floor, and in the wash. They also leave clothes/clutter everywhere in the room and get mad if I ask them to move it.
 I've explained various times why they shouldn't leave wet clothes around, saying it causes mold growth/dust and worsens my allergies.

 They just tell me I'm wrong though and wet clothes don't cause mold. They all have air conditioning (including the living room) while I don't so I don't get why they won't just put them in their rooms. Every time I bring it up my parents call me selfish and jsut start screaming at me that I hate them. 
I'm every day I'm having headaches, congestion, and I can barely even sleep. I walk around sneezing and coughing all year too. I won't have the money to move out for at least a year so I have no idea how I'm suppose to protect my health until then. My mom is a nurse so she knows I'm right, she just denies it cause she doesn't care.

And the last comment I had made before this DM was ""I wish they'd add \[Y\] feature to this item, because then it'd be perfect"", and the one before was ""I can't wait to receive my \[T\]"". Now I also found reminders in that chat history that this friend has also told us all to stop it with a running gag he didn't like, which was not directed towards him or anyone but we acquiesced anyways, even though other running gags that I was annoyed with I just let slide each time. Then we also had to stop talking about \[Z\] because it went against his beliefs and stop bringing up certain foods that only he doesn't eat.

It almost always consisted of just my honest opinions of ""It looks interesting though I don't think \[X\] would work too well/could be easily broken/not work/not accurate"", ""Hopefully they change this in the future"", ""That costs way too much for what it offers (like paying $500 for a commonly found sports team hat)"", etc. And at least to me, there's a 60/40 positive/negative ratio of my comments and it's nothing different from anyone else's opinions being broadcasted in the group chat. And the last comment I had made before this DM was ""I wish they'd add \[Y\] feature to this item, because then it'd be perfect"", and the one before was ""I can't wait to receive my \[T\]"". Now I also found reminders in that chat history that this friend has also told us all to stop it with a running gag he didn't like, which was not directed towards him or anyone but we acquiesced anyways, even though other running gags that I was annoyed with I just let slide each time. Then we also had to stop talking about \[Z\] because it went against his beliefs and stop bringing up certain foods that only he doesn't eat. So I'm worried I'm potentially overreacting to just the usual demands. Basically I just stopped participating in the group chat because I felt singled out and wrongfully accused. He's also stopped talking to me and interacting with my other social media accounts. Was I too strong-handed in defending myself and is everything I said all really so negative?",0.0,0.0436679683625698,0,1

I have been caring for my mom since then. Two weeks ago she broke her hip and was in the Hospital, had surgery , then went to rehab.

The nurse was obviously upset by them because she knows I have been there every day for mom . Sometimes 8 and 10 hours a day. 

So I texted my sister n law, ask her why she said such things. She said well it was the truth I’m sorry the truth hurts .

I am (16F) and my parents are (52F) + (48M) and today while I was at school they had an all day date which is NOT why I was upset. I’m upset because my dad is thinking about purchasing a new car and I told him if he wanted to test drive it I wanted to go with him (because I enjoy doing those type of things AND this would probably be the car I would drive since my parents don’t want me driving our other car). Well during their all day date they went and test drove it and came home talking about “How amazing it was” and etc etc. I was kinda annoyed and when I’m annoyed I kinda shut down so I didn’t say anything and my mom got upset at me and was like “You can’t expect you father and I not to do stuff together by ourselves” (just to add this WAS NOT the only thing they did on their all day date) and like yeah I get that but I told you I wanted to do something and was looking forward to it… I don’t know I just felt upset but my parents are acting like i’m being dramatic and overreacting so I am wondering if I am being a asshole?

130,1eofjvc,AITA for not going on holiday with the family?,"I, 27M have always kept a Good relationship with my mother albeit a bit smothered imo. We all live together me, my parents and younger brother and do go out & spend time together every now & again but this year its been less than usual due to work (just a retail job so nothing glamourous) & getting into a relationship in my case. I have changed I feel, I used to be someone who kept to himself & not really go out but now I've been going out a lot more with people other than my family & is a lot more outgoing. My mother thinks I've changed for the worst for some reason. I've used this time to improve this for my own sake & thought once its steady I'll seriously try for a better career.

A few weeks ago my mother out of the blue came into my room & asked me if I wanted to go on holiday at the end of the month. I told her politely that I couldn't get the time off & to just go without me. She leaves & says nothing so I thought it was alright. A week later she messages me on my way to work that she was going to book the stay & flight in which I replied to her I don't have the time off again. No reply until a few days ago where I realised she booked it & booked a ticket for me as well.

Yesterday, I tried to talk to her & explain that I can't get time off & all she did was tell me she doesn't want to hear it & that I should just call in sick or if not she'll call in sick for me as if I'm a child. I offered to even pay her back double if anything. She then proceeded to walk out the door without any more debate. Again last night I tried to talk to her but we both blew. She tried to blame it on work or my relationship which the latter is going good & the former is fine as well, no trouble at all. She also has called a doctor saying I'm suffering from depression when its quite the opposite, for once life is going well.

Well roll onto today and we had another argument, this time it was really big. Again I couldn't explain a thing, it got to the point where she called me a disgrace for how I've changed & that nothing I do makes sense. She is also telling me to & has offered to even write a resignation letter to force me to move forward (I know she means the best but shes just trying to control me without asking what I plan to do) even with nothing planned. I don't want this at the moment as the job has been good for me. This hurts, all I've ever done is to try and make her proud & happy but no matter how I go about it, its never good enough I feel. She also called everyone that has been good to me at work dirty & bad people who gave me horrible advice (she said worse I'm just paraphrasing).

131,1ep2y04,AITA for refusing to give up half of my business ,"AITA for refusing to give up 50% company ownership to my boyfriend 

This is a throwaway. 

Background: my partner (33M) and I (27F) have been off and on for about two years and on very consistently since March of this year. We have both had our differences but overall when we were separated it was because of timing issues rather than problems with our actual relationship.

I am the primary breadwinner. I’m not rich by any means but I have a respectable savings account and zero debt. My partner is an entrepreneur by choice, he left corporate world and the stability that came with it to open his own business. It was a huge step and I am very proud of him. He has moved in with me and I pay the majority of our bills. We’ve spoken in depth about our relationship and he plans to proposenext year.

I recently came across a business for sale and mentioned buying it to my partner. He was immediately on board and even shared some visions he had for the space. This is when my partner mentioned him being co owner of the space with me. I gently told him that I would be the sole owner because it’s my investment. I can tell this bruised his ego and we’ve been fighting since. He says that he will be providing the vision for the space which I understand and respect but I would be happy to hire him to do so. Heis committed to having some sort of ownership. I’m not comfortable with this considering it is 100% of my investment!


He has proposed several different ideas, the first of which being he could take out a loan and pay me 50% of it. I’m opposed to that because I don’t want to co-own anything with him before we are married. The second would be to work two years unpaid for 50% of the company, I’m uncomfortable with him doing unpaid labor because I believe it is wrong solely based off principal into there is no guarantee that the business will survive two years and then he will feel taken advantage of which is not what I want for him. 


I feel like I’m losing my partner because I won’t give him half of the business. I’ve mentioned to him that if we truly are getting married like he says we are It will be half his in less than a year anyways. Recently it’s gotten so bad that I’m considering backing out of the deal completely for the sake of our relationship but I don’t want to resent him. I’m starting to question to his intentions. I’m able to acknowledge my insecurities but the thought has definitely crossed my mind that he is being disingenuous for the sake of my financial status.

I do feel for him and his ego. I understand it’s hard feeling as though you can’t financially provide as a man but I love and support him regardless of financial status. 

He says I am the asshole for being “financially controlling” and not including him in the deal, I think I am just looking out for myself and making an independent financial decision.
