0,1eot749,AITA for deadnaming my friend?,"So I (F,15) have a friend (16) whom ive known for about six years now. We recently got in touch again after having lost contact because I moved away. He is trans, ftm. I know that he is because he has introduced himself to as a boy to all of my friends I've introduced him to and refers to himself with masculine words and pronouns. He's even talked about the struggles of being trans in a family in which those kinds of things are viewed as something bad. However, he has not yet come out to me. And I don't know why. I have plenty other trans friends and I respect their pronouns and identities, so I would hope it's not that he thinks I'm transphobic. My other theory is that maybe since we've known each other for so long he thinks it would be awkward if he suddenly came out to me? I've thought about asking him about it myself, but I feel like it's not something I can force him to tell me. In the meantime I use feminine pronouns and his deadname for him, (I'm using his chosen pronouns here out of respect) until he tells me something, and while I try my best to use non-gendered words when referring to him, (we talk spanish, which has no gender neutral pronouns) I still feel bad for misgendering and deadnaming him. So AITA?

EDIT: I feel like I should mention this before having more people call me transphobic. Last year the friend in question was talking about about a mutual friend of ours, who is also trans, about how difficult it is to be trans in a household that doesn't respect trans people. I was with them at the moment, though not taking part in the conversation because I'm not trans and I didn't think I could say anything valuable at the time. When they were done talking, my friend told me that he'd tell me what that all was about some day, which I assumed meant he would tell me officially hes trans once he was ready to have that conversation. That's why I don't use masculine pronouns with him irl, I'm waiting for him to be ready to tell me because I feel like thats important to him.

1,1eog22x,AITA regarding my parents?,"For the past 2 or 3 years now my relationship with my parents has been on a steady decline.

I (18) (still in high school) am living with my parents (both 50) in a small mining town in Serbia. 

I am bisexual and a furry, which in a small town, especially in Serbia is something that can get you beaten up very easily. Every day I have to hide these facts from pretty much everyone (including my parents) (there's very few people who know these things) I know since most people would stop liking me. 

I've been suffering from depression and anxiety problems due to my parents, homophobia and having to suffer guilt of who I was before (an extremely hateful and arrogant person). 

My parents are very homophobic, racist and generally bigoted, even though they always claim that they are tolerant towards queer people. Both of my siblings (sister and FTM brother) have cut ties with my parents due to them being awful towards them. 

A few years ago I started talking to my brother again and 
I feel like me wanting to talk to him has triggered my parents' hate towards me. They've been constantly comparing me to him, saying that I'm ""acting just like him"" and that I'm ""going to cut them off after moving out"". They snap at me a lot whenever I call him by his correct pronouns and name. 
I want to change my name a lot since my legal one is really traumatic for me. 

At one point I was hiding my depression from them cause I knew they were going to have a negative reaction (even though my dad is bipolar and mom has depression) and after I almost had a breakdown I snapped and told them that I've had depressive thoughts for a while. The reaction was extremely negative, along with my own dad making depression jokes about me a lot (still does it). 

I've had to limit my contact with my brother due to my parents and it was really hard for me to tell him that. My parents are constantly delusional that my brother is in the same small town, and they've been saying that I'm out with him, even though I've started to hang out with really cool and accepting people recently.

I feel as if all of this was my fault, and that if I never established contact with my brother, never changed as a person and stayed the dickhead I was before, everything would've been fine. I feel like all of the stuff happening to me is a punishment for me being the way I was before and I feel like I'm in the wrong and not my parents.

Another thing that I should note is that I've been closing myself off from my parents due to their hatred, which I feel as if it's making it worse, but at the same time anything I say or do makes me the same as my brother to them and if I don't say anything I'm still acting as my brother.

To any reddit reading channels that post on shorts / reels and etc. I BEG YOU not to use this post, cause I'm really afraid of my parents seeing it.
