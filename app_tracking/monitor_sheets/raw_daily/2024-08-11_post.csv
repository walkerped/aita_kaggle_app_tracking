0,1epelmw,AITA for not making an effort on relationship with my in-laws?,"For backstory, I was pregnant last year and even before that, me and my dh are not close with his parents. It just got worse when I got pregnant with our first child. She kept on telling me nosy stuff like i shouldn‚Äôt going out pregnant as I might slip, inviting herself in the delivery room, and so on. Even with my bil/sil, we are not close.

Just recently, i have decided to be low-key and not really interact much with them. I know i may be going through ppd as I am only 6 months pp. Its been hard and my mil just worsens it every time by wanting to see our child last minute, literally same day msg to drop by in a few hours. I am exhausted and I plan my days ahead as I find it stressful if I don‚Äôt make a schedule. My dh works almost the whole day every week and so weekends are our family days. Anyway, we went to a gathering and she noticed that I don‚Äôt really interact with her. Like ignoring her perhaps. (I usually end up anxious, stressed and palpitating when I meet them and so I shut off and not function making it seem like i‚Äôm a snob) She asked my dh if i was going through something and he said yes. How she answered back baffles me‚Ä¶ she responded by saying that I shouldn‚Äôt be like that as she is his mom. My dh got pissed and said to mind her own business. I always thought people who had kids and are older would be the first ones to understand ftm, i somehow got disappointed but what do I expect though? Also, I was annoyed at her for telling our 6 month old to ‚Äúkiss her godfather‚Äù like who the hell says that to a 6 month old? It triggered me and so I kind of not really interacted with her. I hate this asian culture of us younger people getting disrespected and it‚Äôs okay. But when its us standing up for ourselves they make it seem like we‚Äôre ungrateful people. So‚Ä¶.

1,1epd1zw,AITA for not being interested in my fiancee's strange conversation topics?,"So he likes thinking about off the wall (to me) concepts and topics. Things like he sees on YouTube like flat earth (although he doesn't bring that up anymore so much), hidden and erased history...And he tends to get riled up over small things. Like if we're watching a silly video on YouTube (storytimes, opinions...) and he disagrees with what a person did in that story that happened to them he'll get worked  up that I often get annoyed and offer to change the video so I don't have to listen to him rant. 


Around when the Olympics started he stated how countries like Mexico (cartel) and North Korea (Kim's oppression) shouldn't be allowed to participate. I said they should be because the corruption of their governments aren't the athletes' fault and they shouldn't be punished especially since they work so hard to compete. He didn't like that and I stopped engaging pretty quickly. He went on how Mexican cartels R Americans and how North Korea should be sent a message by being banned. While I agree that all of this is awful and shameful (I'm Mexican American and he's white if that matters) the citizens who want to participate should. He kinda made it personal and said he doubted my S.A. if I was okay with that and how it bothered and affected him personally because of his own S.A. I still struggle to see how was able to correlate the Olympics to all of this. He went to work and then apologized the next morning and said while he still believed what he said, what happened (his ranting) was uncalled for. I said okay, but was still upset and ""let it go"" the next day.

Right now before he left for work as I was packing his lunch he starts up about something called, ""Humanities Hate Incarnate"". Wtf. He said it's a Black and Asian Trans Woman. I was severely confused. He was saying it's what humanity hates the most. And I said something along the lines of I didn't think everyone hates that kind of person and those who do are ignorant and without empathy for what they don't understand and thought we would move on. I finished his lunch and we sat on the couch and he was like, ""Oh, I scared you lol"" and I was petting my kitten and chatting with it and asking him to pet her so it wouldn't turn into another rant. I just said (still confused because wtf), ""I just don't find this very uplifting and it's negative"". Because who tf wants to sit around and talk about what their idea is of ""humanities hatred incarnate"" a topic he just randomly brought up out of nowhere. 

 He does claim to be schizophrenic, but has no diagnosis. I do know for sure he has anxiety and gets worked up and it translates into anger. 

Anyway, I walked away to busy myself for a bit and when I came back I could tell he was annoyed.

2,1epax3o,UPDATE: AITA for accepting a part in a play even though my boyfriend doesn't approve?,"Hello everybody! I doubt anyone remembers me but I haven't been on Reddit much since I posted the original post and I stumbled onto the website tonight, saw my post from three months ago, and decided that at 12:26 in the morning, I would update everyone who wants to know about my situation (which spoiler alert: has thankfully been resolved). If you didn't see my original post from three months ago, you should go read it for context :).

First off, thank you so so so much to everyone who left such sweet, amazing comments. I had to break my legs about 200+ times thanks to you and I still feel so appreciated and encouraged by all the nice things you had to say :).

Anyway, this post is probably already too long and it only gets longer, so heres the actual story: After a few hours of the post going up, I texted my boyfriend at the time to try and start a conversation about what was going on to no avail. When he picked me up from my house to take me to school the next day, he didn't say anything and when we got to school, he parked and told me that he wanted to break up with me because I didn't seem to care that I had voluntarily signed up to be romantic with another guy without talking to him about it first (never mind that this guy he's speaking of is gay and probably would rather eat moldy cheese off of a basketball court than make out with me, and never mind that his boyfriend was totally cool with it because it's ACTING and not a threat to his relationship). I tried explaining some of this to him, but he merely turned off the car, got out of the car and slammed the door.

I was of course, upset because we had been dating for a year and up to this point, everything had been going great. But some of the comments have made me realize that by being blindsided, my boyfriend never believed I could achieve my dreams, and that's an automatic deal breaker for me. Also, he was a high school boyfriend, and I will most likely forget about him, but I will never forget the incredible experience working on this show has been.

My current course of action is to completely ghost him and move on with my life, and then when he least expects it, I'll feed him to Audrey Two as some of you suggested. Opening night was last night, and it was one of the best fucking experiences of my entire life (also as a quick lil' bonus: I'm currently dating the girl that's playing Chiffon and it's going great! We really bonded over the show and she's amazing). Overall, I'm very happy. Thank you again to everyone.

And remember: They may offer you fortune and fame, love and money and instant acclaim, but whatever they offer you, DON'T FEED THE PLANTS!",UPDATE,2024-08-11,"UPDATE: AITA for accepting a part in a play even though my boyfriend doesn't approve?

3,1ep7b4e,AITA for telling my son he needs to give it one year at his new school?,"I accepted a teaching position at private school this summer. It's a well regarded preparatory school with a military school bent. Trying to be vague, but you could probably do a google search and the out of the top five results you'd be correct. One of the perks is my kids can go there for free (I have a 14yo and 16yo boys). The school asked if they wanted to attend, and I asked my boys and they said yes. They were both pretty gung-ho about it.

School starts in a week, and now my 14yo is getting cold feet. I asked why and he said he doesn't want to get a buzz cut or wear a uniform all the time. He does have long surfer hair so it'll will be a big change, as all new students are required to get buzz cuts for the first few weeks, before they can grow it out within regulation. I casually mentioned this to my next door teacher, and she said it's a normal last minute anxiety, but also most students wind up liking having short hair and wearing a uniform.

I told my 14yo that while that's a reasonable worry to have, a uniform/haircut is no reason to pass up this opportunity (especially last minute) and that he should give it one year at this school.",Asshole,2024-08-11,"AITA for telling my son he needs to give it one year at his new school?
