1,1epd1zw,AITA for not being interested in my fiancee's strange conversation topics?,"So he likes thinking about off the wall (to me) concepts and topics. Things like he sees on YouTube like flat earth (although he doesn't bring that up anymore so much), hidden and erased history...And he tends to get riled up over small things. Like if we're watching a silly video on YouTube (storytimes, opinions...) and he disagrees with what a person did in that story that happened to them he'll get worked  up that I often get annoyed and offer to change the video so I don't have to listen to him rant. 


Around when the Olympics started he stated how countries like Mexico (cartel) and North Korea (Kim's oppression) shouldn't be allowed to participate. I said they should be because the corruption of their governments aren't the athletes' fault and they shouldn't be punished especially since they work so hard to compete. He didn't like that and I stopped engaging pretty quickly. He went on how Mexican cartels R Americans and how North Korea should be sent a message by being banned. While I agree that all of this is awful and shameful (I'm Mexican American and he's white if that matters) the citizens who want to participate should. He kinda made it personal and said he doubted my S.A. if I was okay with that and how it bothered and affected him personally because of his own S.A. I still struggle to see how was able to correlate the Olympics to all of this. He went to work and then apologized the next morning and said while he still believed what he said, what happened (his ranting) was uncalled for. I said okay, but was still upset and ""let it go"" the next day.

Right now before he left for work as I was packing his lunch he starts up about something called, ""Humanities Hate Incarnate"". Wtf. He said it's a Black and Asian Trans Woman. I was severely confused. He was saying it's what humanity hates the most. And I said something along the lines of I didn't think everyone hates that kind of person and those who do are ignorant and without empathy for what they don't understand and thought we would move on. I finished his lunch and we sat on the couch and he was like, ""Oh, I scared you lol"" and I was petting my kitten and chatting with it and asking him to pet her so it wouldn't turn into another rant. I just said (still confused because wtf), ""I just don't find this very uplifting and it's negative"". Because who tf wants to sit around and talk about what their idea is of ""humanities hatred incarnate"" a topic he just randomly brought up out of nowhere. 

 He does claim to be schizophrenic, but has no diagnosis. I do know for sure he has anxiety and gets worked up and it translates into anger. 

Anyway, I walked away to busy myself for a bit and when I came back I could tell he was annoyed.

2,1epax3o,UPDATE: AITA for accepting a part in a play even though my boyfriend doesn't approve?,"Hello everybody! I doubt anyone remembers me but I haven't been on Reddit much since I posted the original post and I stumbled onto the website tonight, saw my post from three months ago, and decided that at 12:26 in the morning, I would update everyone who wants to know about my situation (which spoiler alert: has thankfully been resolved). If you didn't see my original post from three months ago, you should go read it for context :).

First off, thank you so so so much to everyone who left such sweet, amazing comments. I had to break my legs about 200+ times thanks to you and I still feel so appreciated and encouraged by all the nice things you had to say :).

Anyway, this post is probably already too long and it only gets longer, so heres the actual story: After a few hours of the post going up, I texted my boyfriend at the time to try and start a conversation about what was going on to no avail. When he picked me up from my house to take me to school the next day, he didn't say anything and when we got to school, he parked and told me that he wanted to break up with me because I didn't seem to care that I had voluntarily signed up to be romantic with another guy without talking to him about it first (never mind that this guy he's speaking of is gay and probably would rather eat moldy cheese off of a basketball court than make out with me, and never mind that his boyfriend was totally cool with it because it's ACTING and not a threat to his relationship). I tried explaining some of this to him, but he merely turned off the car, got out of the car and slammed the door.

I was of course, upset because we had been dating for a year and up to this point, everything had been going great. But some of the comments have made me realize that by being blindsided, my boyfriend never believed I could achieve my dreams, and that's an automatic deal breaker for me. Also, he was a high school boyfriend, and I will most likely forget about him, but I will never forget the incredible experience working on this show has been.

My current course of action is to completely ghost him and move on with my life, and then when he least expects it, I'll feed him to Audrey Two as some of you suggested. Opening night was last night, and it was one of the best fucking experiences of my entire life (also as a quick lil' bonus: I'm currently dating the girl that's playing Chiffon and it's going great! We really bonded over the show and she's amazing). Overall, I'm very happy. Thank you again to everyone.

And remember: They may offer you fortune and fame, love and money and instant acclaim, but whatever they offer you, DON'T FEED THE PLANTS!",UPDATE,2024-08-11,"UPDATE: AITA for accepting a part in a play even though my boyfriend doesn't approve?

School starts in a week, and now my 14yo is getting cold feet. I asked why and he said he doesn't want to get a buzz cut or wear a uniform all the time. He does have long surfer hair so it'll will be a big change, as all new students are required to get buzz cuts for the first few weeks, before they can grow it out within regulation. I casually mentioned this to my next door teacher, and she said it's a normal last minute anxiety, but also most students wind up liking having short hair and wearing a uniform.

This is our first home together that we are financially responsible for, and we are very happy to be here.

My parents went through a very nasty divorce in 2021, involving infidelity and other ongoing issues prior to the settlement. They hate each other and refuse to work together when it comes to me and my two younger siblings. It is very hard to get anything done with these tensions, but that‚Äôs not the point of this post.

7,1epyx6l,AITA? For not accepting some baby gifts from my parents ,"AITA?

 I 32f am expecting my first child with my husband, 32m in October. This is the first grandchild in my family and everyone is very excited. My father 65m lives for NASCAR- I personally could not care less for it. I have grown up in a house full of nascar memorabilia and been given nascar items at Christmas, birthdays etc. even though I have said to my father many times before I have no interest. Given that this was an issue with gifts in the past early on in the pregnancy we told my parents that we would accept 1-2 items but that we don‚Äôt want a house full of nascar stuff. I felt the need to set the boundary since I don‚Äôt want them to waste their money and we also don‚Äôt want a ton of clutter. 

Now we found out from my brother that with my father has bought a ton of nascar items- onesies, baby dishes, toys you name it. He is planning to gift us this after our shower. I don‚Äôt want it and my husband doesn‚Äôt either.  I called my mother and told her that we will keep the request for only one or two things and asked for him not to get more items and that we would give back or pass on any additional nascar related gifts. I called her since my father and I do not approach conflict well- he tends to lose his tempter and hang up on my or leave the conversation if we‚Äôre in person. My mother thinks I am being too harsh and ungrateful for the things they are providing to us. I understand they want to have fun and this is exciting for them too but the thought of a house full of nascar baby clutter just makes me so stressed out. AITA?

8,1epyujp,AITA for telling my friend her breakup was an inappropriate topic at my engagement party,"Me (M32) and my fianc√© (F30) had an engagement party this summer.  The party was great and we had a good time with friends & family etc, however one thing really bugged both me and my fianc√©.  

I have a friend, call her Madison (32), she was invited to the party and is someone I have been friends with for a long time, since junior high (about 11 years old for non US people).  On the day of the party she told us she broke up with her boyfriend, we consoled her and cared for her and tried to make sure she was ok whilst also organising the party.  We had 200 guests so there was a lot of food/drinks/organising to do. 

When Madison arrived to the party, the only topic she spoke about was breaking up with her boyfriend, the first thing she said to me and my fianc√© was about breaking up and then asking a bunch of inappropriate questions (think sex related etc) about our personal relationship to try and compare against her failed one and telling us things about her breakup and no congratulations to us.  We of course wanted to enjoy the party so tried to console and then change conversations/lighten the mood etc, but that didn‚Äôt really work and essentially it was the only thing she spoke about all night to us and any of the 200 or so guests we had, she proceeded to get drunk and then talk in detail about her sex life to our friends.  Quite a few people commented on this to us and said she was quite overbearing.   

On the night, I didn‚Äôt bring it up with her and didn‚Äôt want to cause a scene and ruin the party and generally had a great night, however, this stuck in both mine and my fianc√©‚Äôs mind and we didn‚Äôt like the fact she couldn‚Äôt just celebrate us and have a good night.   

So I spoke to Madison about it a week later and said that her talking about her breakup all night wasn‚Äôt very nice for us and brought the atmosphere down and that she could‚Äôve just enjoyed the night instead, that it made us feel annoyed, that we didn‚Äôt like that you did that and please could you not do it in the future.  At the time of this conversation Madison agreed and apologised, but then some days later texted and said actually we were wrong for bringing it up and that she thinks it‚Äôs strange we were bothered by her being upset, that all her friends agree we are the weird ones, that she didn‚Äôt say anything inappropriate to anyone (which is not true, so I think she‚Äôs in denial about this part or embarrassed to admit it), that she was upset, we should just support her and that we are not good friends to her for even bringing it up.  

We now are at a stalemate as I don‚Äôt want to apologise and Madison has pretty much taken her apology back.  

So I want to know 1. AITA for being annoyed about Madison only talking about her breakup and intimate relationship details at mine and my fianc√©‚Äôs engagement party? 

And 2. AITA for then bringing this up to her to ask that she not do that again/make her aware that we didn‚Äôt like what she did.  

",Not the A-hole,2024-08-11,"AITA for telling my friend her breakup was an inappropriate topic at my engagement party Me (M32) and my fianc√© (F30) had an engagement party this summer.  The party was great and we had a good time with friends & family etc, however one thing really bugged both me and my fianc√©.  

I have a friend, call her Madison (32), she was invited to the party and is someone I have been friends with for a long time, since junior high (about 11 years old for non US people).  On the day of the party she told us she broke up with her boyfriend, we consoled her and cared for her and tried to make sure she was ok whilst also organising the party.  We had 200 guests so there was a lot of food/drinks/organising to do. 

When Madison arrived to the party, the only topic she spoke about was breaking up with her boyfriend, the first thing she said to me and my fianc√© was about breaking up and then asking a bunch of inappropriate questions (think sex related etc) about our personal relationship to try and compare against her failed one and telling us things about her breakup and no congratulations to us.  We of course wanted to enjoy the party so tried to console and then change conversations/lighten the mood etc, but that didn‚Äôt really work and essentially it was the only thing she spoke about all night to us and any of the 200 or so guests we had, she proceeded to get drunk and then talk in detail about her sex life to our friends.  Quite a few people commented on this to us and said she was quite overbearing.   

On the night, I didn‚Äôt bring it up with her and didn‚Äôt want to cause a scene and ruin the party and generally had a great night, however, this stuck in both mine and my fianc√©‚Äôs mind and we didn‚Äôt like the fact she couldn‚Äôt just celebrate us and have a good night.

11,1epyfi5,AITA for confronting my girlfriend about dirty Tupperware? ,"Hello,

       My girlfriend is very sweet to me and I love her so much. She always likes to take care of me and I love her for it. Last night she had baked cookies for a party that‚Äôs today and she put aside about 6 or 7 for me to take with me to work. When I went to see her she gave me the cookies in a plastic Tupperware container and I took them home. 
       When I got home and opened the tupperwear container there was fur on the inside and the container looked grease like it was not cleaned with soap and water I removed the cookies and there was more fur throughout the container. I‚Äôm not usually a picky person but one thing that just kinda grosses me out is hair or fur in or around my food or in or on plates and bowls. My girlfriend knows this as well.
        When I told her the container was like this she told me she had cleaned it. I said that next time please put them in a new ziplock bag or wash the container before using it. At this she began to cry and I felt horrible. She comes from a house that has cats and dogs so I understand fur around but I also come from a house with 5 dogs and have the habit of checking eating wear before using it and if there‚Äôs anything on it I simple just wash it.
        I‚Äôve eaten everything my girlfriend has ever made for me but this isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened but I usually don‚Äôt say anything but I did this time.

We had a family BBQ at the beach because my mother-in-law (MIL) was visiting from out of town. We initially kept it small with close family and friends since my MIL gets awkward around strangers. However, one of my cousins (32M), who is separated from his wife and recently out of prison, was invited last minute by the family member he was staying with. My wife (31F) was uncomfortable with this due to his past and appearance, as her family is more conservative.

At the BBQ, my cousin did not contribute any food but constantly criticized my grilling. He kept interfering with the grill, causing it to go out and waste time and charcoal. I was frustrated and asked him to stop so I could cook for everyone, as we had a schedule and guests were hungry. Then, my cousin invited a coworker who showed up with five more people, all of whom did not bring anything. They helped themselves to drinks, food, and other items from the coolers.

When I checked the grill, my cousin mocked my cooking, which made me lose my temper. My wife was upset with the uninvited guests and the fact that her family hadn't eaten yet. I took a walk to cool down. When I returned, the uninvited guests had eaten almost everything, and my MIL, wife, and kids had not eaten yet. I decided to pack up the remaining food and left early.

Now, some family members are saying I overreacted and should have just gone out to eat if we were hungry. I feel like the effort and money put into the BBQ were wasted on people who didn't respect the event. I left to avoid further conflict and ensure my immediate family had something to eat.

So the day the incident happened I was driving from the shore with I forgot my sun shade in the house so when we got in my car it was boiling due to it being 90* in NJ.  So i keep my AC to 74* If you don‚Äôt like it you can catch a uber or walk. So when my friend decides to change it to 66* I tell him to put it back to 74* but he argues that thats not doing nothing. So after a long argument I stop at the intersection of West Laurel Drive and Rt 9 and kick him out. After that I drove home. So about a hour later My friend texts me and says that ‚Äúwe no longer friends‚Äù so I say ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt gotta be like that‚Äù. Then he blocks me. After that the GC of my friends say that they‚Äôre no longer friends then they kick me from the GC. So I go to my best friend and he says in quote ‚Äúthat was being L mans‚Äù Then he stopped responding to me. So now im basically friendless for no good reason.

She(72f) is a great, funny, loving and supportive person and we get along really well. Before we got married she was asking us to come live with her. Her boyfriend (73m)doesn't like having people around. It would start with little things. 
He would get mad if we slept in passed 6:30 am and come pounding on the door. Got upset that it took my husband a little bit longer to find a job and then when we started working he got upset that we were working so much and sleeping in on our days off. He will yell and snap at Grandma for being on her phone and patronize her saying ""So you just gonna do nothing all day?"" After she spent all day cleaning the house and cooking for him.
I would say goodmorning, goodnight, how are you,etc and 9/10 he'd look right at me and ignore me. Me and my husband keep the room clean everyday and I clean the bathroom every week and he sat me down and told me that I am sloppy and lazy because I can't keep anything clean. Meanwhile my room and bathroom are always spotless aside from our laundry. He said we are only allowed to do one load of laundry once a week. That's including our work clothes, towels and sheets. He said that all I have is excuses and I explained to him that I do keep things clean to the best of my ability and that the reason why I stay out of his way and in the room is because I feel like my presence isn't wanted and I feel uncomfortable around him. Which he replied with ""you're good for nothing, I wonder why. I am the man of this house and I Pay the bills and you don't pay anything."" I then proceeded for what seems like the hundredth time to offer him rent money to which he responded ""I don't want your money I want you to move out.""

20,1epwp0o,AITA for not paying for my cousin's iPhone,"I (34F) live in the US with my mom (my dad died ten years ago). Both of my sisters live a thirty-minute drive away. The majority of our relatives live in a third world county‚Äîit's where both of my parents grew up. My sisters and I were all born in the US.

Last year, my family travaled to this country so we could attend my cousin's (F25) wedding. I had purchased a new iPhone earlier in the year and decided to gift my old one to a different cousin (M42) since his phone at the time was very old and unreliable. If I'm recalling correct, my F25 cousin's phone was in pretty good shape/functioning just fine.

We had a really good family vacation and I honestly didn't think about my old iPhone once it was out of my hands.

Yesterday, my F25 cousin messaged me and asked if I was planning to get a new phone and, if so, could I give her my old phone. I found this odd because:

1. You literally can't mail a package to this country; it will 100% be stolen.
2. I have no plans to travel to this country any time in the near future so it's impossible for me to physically hand it over to her.

Given these circumstances, there really isn't a way for me to send her an iPhone even if I wanted to‚Äîand I don't because I have no plans to get a new phone anytime soon. As someone who lives in this country, my F25 cousin knows I can't send her an iPhone. She also knows that we're not planning to visit this country anytime soon. So reading between the lines, I feel like what she actually wanted was for me to send her the money so she can buy an iPhone for herself.

The whole exchange was super weird to me. I have a good relationship with my F25 cousin but we're not super close‚Äîthink exchanging texts maybe three times/year. One of my sisters also agreed that it was a weird request. I mentioned this conversation to my mom and told her it made me uncomfortable. She dismissed the interaction as no big deal; said something along the lines of ""Well, people there can barely afford clothes so it makes sense that they'd reach out about something as expensive as an iPhone."" I did not expect that kind of response. Yes, my extended family lives in a third world county but all of them are either firmly middle class or actually pretty wealthy.

My mom's reaction and comments made me feel like she thought I was being a jerk by refusing to buy my cousin an iPhone. My mom knows that financially I can afford to gift the money for a new iPhone. I'm not doing it because I just don't want to. It's such an expensive request.

Am I being selfish here? I don't think I'm under any kind of family obligation to just give away $1000+.

But it recently dawned on me that she has meddled in every relationship I‚Äôve ever had. My dad and my brother have told me this for years and I‚Äôve broken up with people I‚Äôve liked in the past because I‚Äôve listened to her views. 

A few years ago I dated a guy who was super lovely, really kind to me and I broke up with him for no reason but I‚Äôd had my mum in my ear constantly about how boring he was. My mum places a lot of value on looks. She said this boyfriend looked like a pig and that I was settling. She would be standoffish if he was at our house. My dad and brother got on really well with him and the rest of my family knew I had liked him but for reason the constant negativity got in my head.

Last year I got in to a relationship with a new guy, mum liked him for the first couple of times she met him then decided she hated him. At the beginning I was happy and he came in our family holiday and mum made it so uncomfortable, she wouldn‚Äôt even look at him. After the holiday things deteriorated and he gave me a long list of the things he‚Äôd ‚Äúoverlooked‚Äù by being with me, essentially all my flaws and I ended up breaking up with him.

As a side note, when my brother and his now wife first got together she hated his wife. She‚Äôd make it super uncomfortable and said she would happily cut him off if it got to it. My brother lives away so he was pretty unaware of the intense hatred she had for his wife. Now mum and her get on absolutely fine.

Anyway, we obviously aren‚Äôt friends anymore, and one of them was kicked out of a mutual organization due to her actions, which may affect her negatively in the future. I do feel bad for this because I didn‚Äôt mean any harm, and I only wanted the damage to be undone on my end. 

What‚Äôs worse is that a bunch of our mutual friends (including two of my best friends) are now degrading me. My one friend accused me of being jealous of one of the friends that I reported and said that I only did so because I wanted to take her out of the running for a spot we were both competing for in a program. Another friend told me that I was toxic for doing so and that I wasn‚Äôt a true friend because I wouldn‚Äôt have snitched on them, and I do understand what they are saying to a degree because I could have heard them out more. It still hurts that some of my other friends are turning on me, and people are blocking me now without listening to my side of the story.

27,1epuu3a,AITA for asking my fianc√© to get back the PlayStation VR he gave to his nephew without asking me?,"I've been with my fianc√© for over 6 years, and his family and I have never really gotten along. There‚Äôs a lot of drama, drug use, and toxicity in his family, and it's been hard for me to connect with them. I come from a different background, which I think has contributed to the tension.

A few years ago, my fianc√©'s sister, ""M,"" had her mother, ""G,"" living with her, along with M's kids and their father. The house was chaotic, and I didn't enjoy being there. Eventually, G and her grandson, ""CJ,"" who has behavioral issues, moved in with G's brother. But after some time, they were asked to leave, and my fianc√© suggested that CJ come live with us since G couldn't take him.

I‚Äôm not a child person, but I agreed because I felt bad for CJ, who didn‚Äôt ask for this situation. CJ lived with us for 9 months, and it was incredibly difficult. He had no sense of discipline, and I tried to instill some responsibilities, like chores, which he resisted. I did my best to care for him and even moved to a larger house to give him his own space. We bought him a bed, furniture, and I even gave him my PlayStation 4 for Christmas because the 3D printer I got him wasn‚Äôt a great fit.

During this time, G was receiving $800 a month to support CJ but didn‚Äôt contribute any of it to us. When I found out, I confronted her angrily and learned that she had intentionally kept this information from us. She agreed to start giving us the money, but shortly after, G took CJ for a weekend, which turned into him never coming back. G accused me of being mean to CJ, said I was abusive to my fianc√© (which CJ had been telling her), and claimed I was only after money. This hurt deeply, as it wasn‚Äôt true, and it felt like losing a child. My fianc√©‚Äôs relationship with his mother suffered greatly.

Recently, my fianc√© and G started to repair their relationship. My fianc√© asked if he could give CJ the PlayStation 4, which I initially didn‚Äôt want to do, but I agreed. However, I later found out that my fianc√© also gave CJ my PlayStation VR without asking me, which was never part of the deal. I was furious and asked him to get it back.

My mom died a few weeks ago. I travelled from out of state to sit with her as she was dying.

She said she was 30 minutes away in another town and ""couldn't make it"".  Our older sister was watching my daughter and didn't have a good relationship with our mom and my brother was out of state. 

If my mom's friend didn't stay with me I would have been on my own.  

A few days later my sisters and I went to the funeral home and discussed the arrangements.  We had a list of dates that I wrote down and gave to a church as options, one of them being the third. 

Church called back, said they had time on the third. I set up everything. I wrote the obituary with the information. I sent it out for review of all the siblings. I posted it on Facebook and my little sister said nothing. 

A few days before the funeral I said I had to modify a time slightly on the third and she said in a text ""Like I said. I can't make it on the 3rd.""  My older sister confirmed we never heard her say anything about that date. She didn't say anything about the obit at all. Her half sister was pissed at us. 

I didn't reschedule. Especially because she never gave me a reason. She doesn't work and it was a Saturday. 

On the day of the funeral she came to the visitation without her family and told me she had a concert to go to and the ""tickets were expensive"" so she wouldn't be able to make the burial or funeral. Which would last until about 5pm. 

She later posted the concert she went to. It was an emo cover band and the cover charge was 10 dollars. It was an hour away and started at 8pm. She had plenty of time after the funeral to make it. 

She and her sister are still mad that I didn't respect her time. Her sister even stormed out of the burial and made a scene.

90% of the things in the common/living room area are mine. I brought the rug, coffee table, tv stand, lamp, blankets, bar stools, fan, couch, bookshelf, decorations and some other etc things. The only thing that is hers in that common area is the tv. 

I tend to fall asleep on the couch a lot. Edit here - I have fibromyalgia and warned her about this and told her never to work around me and never try to be quiet if I do, just go about business how you usually do. I sit on the couch much more than her and offer to trade places when she sits on the floor but doesn‚Äôt want to. I‚Äôve asked multiple times if the living situation was okay because she didn‚Äôt seem very enticed to use the common area. She said everything is fine. 

I was on a work trip for 4 days, got home to everything on the kitchen counter and island being rearranged which I didn‚Äôt care too much about but was a little confused. I moved two things back because one of them was my charger I use daily and second was my Lego flowers that she put on top of the stove. 

She sends me a text message upset (even though she saw me the day before and same day she sent the text and didn't say anything in person) about other things out of my control but was more saying that the common area doesn‚Äôt feel like hers.

30,1epumwm,WIBTA for moving into a bigger room in my apartment? ,"I (19f) am about to start my second year of university. Last year, I lived with both of my parents and commuted in, which whislt difficult, has allowed me to save some money to rent a place for the next year with two of my friends. In the apartment we've rented, due to me being extremely sick at the time, I wasn't able to view it before we moved in like my friends did. They assured me that all rooms were of a liveable size etc.

 All three bedrooms in the flat are of different sizes with the smallest (my room) only being able to fit a bed and that's about it. The room is literally so small that in order to put a fitted sheet on the mattress I had to move the mattress out the bedroom so that I could turn it on its side properly. The room also has a couple cupboards on the walls for storage space, however they are very high up and because of my height (I'm super short), I am unable to reach and use them. Both my friends have rooms that are at least triple the size of mine with two chests of drawers etc each. So, they have kindly let me use the lounge, which has a small wardrobe, as storage space. However, this wardrobe is very small and for stuff like underwear, I've had to invest in another (tiny) set of drawers to fit them. But obviously since the original agreement was that the lounge isn't my room, I'd need to put the drawers in my bedroom but there's literally no space for them. Neither of my friends have moved in yet, but with me slowly having to store all my stuff in the lounge instead of my room, I'm starting to realize that life would be a lot easier if I just moved permanently into the lounge given my lack of private and storage space. 

I told one of my friends about doing this temporarily whilst I figure out how to lay everything out in an accessible way for me, which she was fine with, but I'm just worried about the future when inevitably nothing fits and I end up rammed into a tiny uncomfortable space. However, obviously if I were to move into the lounge permanently, this would mean the sofas etc would become part of my room and we'd end up losing our communal space, which I know they love about the flat. At the moment I pay ¬£20 (about $35) less rent per month than my friends, but if I were to get the lounge, which is a much bigger space and more equal to their room sizes I'd be prepared to pay more.

32,1epuizp,AITA for still attending family gatherings?,"A bit of backstory. 

I (43M) met my ex (44F) some years ago. It didn't take long (though with a bit of convincing) for me to be accepted by her family and I became part of the core. This increased as my son (15M) was born a few years later and my Mother's death a couple of years after, where my then MIL was a great comfort. MIL and FIL filled part of the gab I had been left with, being there as the ""adults"" close by, when things needed to be talked about. 

About 6 years ago I found out my ex was cheating on me and it lead to some quite turbulent times with AH'ery on both sides. Her family however made it very clear, that I was still considered part of the family. One turbulent year later and my ex and I became friends again (realizing that misery was a choice that also affected my kid). To be honest, with a better relationship that the last 2 years we were together. Her new BF (the man she cheated with) and I socialised on a civil plane. 

Things went about peacefully with me attending birthdays, Easter and Christmas at the former in-laws' house. Slowly I became the son my ex-in-laws never had (their statement) and my ex's sister has called me her brother she didn't have. My son has loved this - unlike other friends he has from divorced parents there is no fighting here or quarrel over parenting and he is able to enjoy the big moment with both his mom and dad there with no bickering. 

Now we get to the issue. She (my ex) has found a new fellow. He is from a conservative upbringing and found the family constellation a bit strange. I get this. The family can seem a bit strange, but it has been working for all involved. He started with a hesitation that we all tried to accommodate, being open about what went on. A few months back he stated that family gatherings, where I was attending, he would not be attending. I offered to give the family some distance, but this was categorically rejected by ex MIL, FIL and SIL - ""Nobody but us decides who comes and goes in our house."" 

The latest escalation was, that not only would my ex's new BF not attend, but he had decided that my ex would not attend either if I was there. The family is 100% on ""my side"" so to speak. He also stated, that if she was going anywhere I was going (such as to our son's school 2 hours drive away), he would be driving her and not let her drive with me. 

I just need to get a bit of a sanity check on this. AITA for still attending when I am invited to my former MIL and FIL's house? They mean the world to me and I do regard them as my second pair of parents. ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-11,"AITA for still attending family gatherings? A bit of backstory. 

I (43M) met my ex (44F) some years ago. It didn't take long (though with a bit of convincing) for me to be accepted by her family and I became part of the core. This increased as my son (15M) was born a few years later and my Mother's death a couple of years after, where my then MIL was a great comfort. MIL and FIL filled part of the gab I had been left with, being there as the ""adults"" close by, when things needed to be talked about. 

About 6 years ago I found out my ex was cheating on me and it lead to some quite turbulent times with AH'ery on both sides. Her family however made it very clear, that I was still considered part of the family. One turbulent year later and my ex and I became friends again (realizing that misery was a choice that also affected my kid). To be honest, with a better relationship that the last 2 years we were together. Her new BF (the man she cheated with) and I socialised on a civil plane. 

Things went about peacefully with me attending birthdays, Easter and Christmas at the former in-laws' house. Slowly I became the son my ex-in-laws never had (their statement) and my ex's sister has called me her brother she didn't have. My son has loved this - unlike other friends he has from divorced parents there is no fighting here or quarrel over parenting and he is able to enjoy the big moment with both his mom and dad there with no bickering.

34,1epuf4r,AITA for not letting my brother antagonize me?,"

My brother Ben visited recently and wanted lunch after he got off the plane. At lunch with the other brother, Brett, we got on the topic of high school. Ben brought up that he would not be sure if there wouldn‚Äôt be any bullying for coming out as trans in a bigger school as opposed to the other smaller one we went to, especially in the bathroom. I said that conservatives cared more about men in the bathroom and ‚Äúwomen‚Äù (I did use air quotes) in the mens room. I‚Äôm pretty sure this is verbatim what I said. Ben immediately cut me off telling me that he wasn‚Äôt comfortable, so I asked him to explain. He said that the way I used air quotes for the word ‚Äúwomen‚Äù was icky. I tried explaining to Ben that I was basically referring to trans men in context, and I think the wrong way to do that was to say ‚Äúpeople born with v4ginas using the mens‚Äô room.‚Äù However, Brett was just as confused as I was watching this play out. He seemed to get right away that I was referring to trans men. If anything, I flubbed when I just said ‚Äúmen‚Äù straight up, but this isn‚Äôt the part that set off Ben. 

I stopped responding at some point to just get him to change the topic. He left shortly thereafter, and Brett and I went home.

I got the cold shoulder treatment for about a day until I decided to just go downstairs when he was petting the dog with my parents to go strike up a conversation. Later that week, Ben needed to go get something from the store for a presentation he was going to do next week, and I needed something there. I offered to drive and help cover costs, and he said ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù as I was about to leave. I said ‚Äúscrew it,‚Äù and went to my car. I don‚Äôt know what was said, but my dad stopped me from driving away and dragged my brother out to go with me. He played his music on the aux and was mostly silent. Ben did take me up on my offer to cover the cost of some premium materials.

Another night, we all went out to eat at dinner, but my parents asked us to make sure that we arrived on time to get the table we reserved. I barely finished showering on time, but Ben was in no rush, and I had to wait for him to end a call. I drove fast, but not very recklessly, and squeezed through some yellow lights to make good time. During dinner, my brother made a rude remark about my driving on the way up, and I reminded him that he put us behind schedule and I had no way of knowing if we were going to make it. He brought up my accident history, so I retorted that he didn‚Äôt have much room to talk. I tried to start a conversation with him later that evening, but he flat out ignored me all the way up until he left two days later to catch his flight. Pretty sure he‚Äôs still mad.

If I owe Ben an apology, I‚Äôll make one, but if not, I‚Äôll leave it. Some stuff was left out, but there‚Äôs a character limit. Feel free to ask for clarification.

36,1epu8za,AITA for constantly being annoyed and exhausted by my boyfriend ,"we are long distance. 
he has never dated anyone.
we do not want to separate.

i (F) and my boyfriend (M) (jonas) have been dating since october of 2023. we do not live together

this story starts in march. we have never really argued before 

i have an important trip and he's arguing with me constantly for no real reason and getting really mean and it's stressing me out (i have a severe anxiety disorder that he is aware of) he apologized to me while i was flying and when i landed i accepted his apology and when i got home a few days later. i called him and we worked it out and it's been fine since july

mid july i had another trip but it was personal and i needed to visit family for a few weeks. i was obviously upset and stressed due to the fact i was the only person there to support during a family emergency for weeks and he's jealous and just mad and constantly arguing with me again over dumb stuff because i'm overwhelmed 

i'm good at communicating when i am overwhelmed and stressed and i haven't gone nonverbal in 1 1/2 years and it happened 4 times. in one week. because of him. 

after almost 2 1/2 weeks i finally get home and i'm pissed because of the amount of energy and stressed that he was causing and he blamed it on his amount of jealousy because i was at the ""beach"" (the incident that happened was in a beach-adjacent town.)

he takes almost until august to apologize and i had been irritable with my family, friends and him & he would say outlandish shit and i'd make a comment and he'd get REALLY offended and get mean over text.

he apologized the day before my family vacation and it was very genuine. my next trip had no service

i had to walk up almost two miles as i was uncomfortable driving here and instead walked. jonas was ok with limited talking until august 8th, where he begs me to keep talking to him and i almost spend two hours doing so and he got really mean when i had to go and i was overwhelmed and couldn't sleep after that

i got home the next day and couldn't talk much as i was helping unload

he was okay with this and didn't seem too upset but he was just... reallt rude for the rest of last night??? way rude??? and very short and i had a kinda attitude after arguing with him and someone else throughout the day and we argued until 4am.

this morning he was arguing with me again and i got so overwhelmed with a continuous stream pitiful texts from him i went non verbal for 40 minutes and my sister had to help me (i do not need support usually)

i give him the excuse of not dating anyone before and my past relationships with distructive people.

stuff has been worse than this but km scared of it happening again and i'm always so exhausted talking to him because it takes so much of my energy to talk to him and i wish it was easier. he isn't boring but my friends have called him immature and intense

They bought a place together and they want to get married. Before moving I (16f) always shared a room with my sister (10f). And my brother (12m) had his own room. But because my mom's partner has a 15 year old daughter and his other kids are boys, they didn't want her in a room with the boys. So my sister was moved into a room with my brother and I was told her partners daughter and I would be sharing. I didn't like that. I told her I'd rather share with my brother and let my sister share with her partners daughter. Mom said that was not a good idea. My brother and sister suggested the three of us could share but mom cited space as the reason that couldn't happen.

I didn't want to share a bedroom with someone I'm not close to. Love my siblings so no big deal to share with them. Don't love the 15 year old so it was not something I was cool with. And my mom tried to argue about college but I won't be going to college. I'm going to do a trade. And even if I end up with roommates, we'll have our own spaces. I told her all this. I also talked to her about my decision to stay with dad full time. It was written in their custody order that once we reach 16 we can make that decision if we want to.

My mom didn't think I was serious. The wakeup call was when I moved nothing into her new house and only stayed for short visits vs overnight visits. My dad fully supports this.

My mom and her partner aren't happy. And he's extra unhappy because his daughter is now the oldest and has no one close in age to hang with during family time. She's not that close with her brothers according to my mom and her partner. I told them I'm not here to be her entertainment or companion and I'd hang with my siblings anyway, and the age gap is not a problem.

My mom gave me an ultimatum to move in with them and stop living full time with dad. When I didn't change my mind she told me I was acting spoiled and mentioned I had always shared a room. I said sharing a room was not the issue. But I always shared with siblings, not another random kid. Mom said it was so entitled to say that and she also cussed my dad out for allowing me to live with him. She can't fight it though. It's in their custody papers.

My mom gave me an ultimatum to move in with them and stop living full time with dad. When I didn't change my mind she told me I was acting spoiled and mentioned I had always shared a room. I said sharing a room was not the issue. But I always shared with siblings, not another random kid. Mom said it was so entitled to say that and she also cussed my dad out for allowing me to live with him. She can't fight it though. It's in their custody papers.

39,1epu07s,AITA showing up announced ,"Ihave a complicated family dynamic. My mom has kids with four different men, but she didn‚Äôt raise any of us‚Äîshe chose drugs and a party lifestyle instead. I was raised by various people on my dad‚Äôs side in Colorado until I was 14, when I was on my own, pregnant, and in an abusive relationship. My older sister was raised by my mom's mother in Northern California, my younger sister by her dad in Northern California, and my younger brother by his dad in Southern California. 

The two sisters knew each other growing up, but my brother and I didn‚Äôt know them or that side of the family. When I was 30, I moved to Northern California to live with my younger sister, but it didn‚Äôt work out, so I moved back to New Mexico, where I had already built my life. I eventually moved back to Colorado in 2005 to reconnect with my dad's family, but it didn't work out, though I did meet my husband here.

In 2007, I found my brother on social media. We‚Äôve never met, but we‚Äôve stayed in contact. My older sister, who was raised by our grandmother, was raised more like a sister to my mom. This was kept a family secret until she accidentally found out at 14. We made contact when I was in my early 20s, but our personalities didn‚Äôt mesh. We weren‚Äôt close, but I remained cordial.

When I lived in California for a year, we went to lunch once, and I paid even though I was broke. She just complained about the food, which hurt my feelings since I was trying to connect. Since then, she occasionally reaches out, but it‚Äôs never substantial.

Two years ago, she invited me to a 4th of July family reunion. I didn‚Äôt want to go, but my mom‚Äôs health issues and my sister‚Äôs guilt-tripping made me cave. I paid for plane tickets for my whole family, and she assured me we could stay at her place and that her husband would pick us up from the airport. A week before the trip, she suddenly changed her mind, saying her house was full, so I had to book an Airbnb last minute. Then she told me her husband couldn‚Äôt pick us up, so I had to rent a vehicle, which wasn‚Äôt cheap. The trip ended up costing me $4k for just two days. It was overwhelming, and while we‚Äôre still in contact, it‚Äôs nothing special.

Last weekend, she came to Colorado for her husband‚Äôs family‚Äôs birthday party and decided to ""surprise"" me by showing up at my house unannounced.

42,1eptjra,AITA for not letting my mother come to my son's 1st birthday,"In 2020, my mum offered to buy her house for me and two of my brothers, Dylan and Brooklyn. This was because she had no way of getting any life insurance after having two strokes. 
Dylan decided he didn't want to live in the house, so it was just me and Brooklyn, along with my now fiance and dog. However, he needed to keep his stuff in one of the rooms, plus the whole of the cabin. I was working 6 nights a week, and my fiance was at college, so we were struggling to keep the house up to standard as well as looking after my 15-year-old brother, cooking dinners, washing clothes and so on. My mother decided she wanted to kick me out so my brother could move in.
When I asked if I could keep some of my stuff in a room or cabin while I sorted somewhere to live, my brother said no, and my mother agreed. I couldn't take my dog as we moved into my fiance's mother's house and there wasn't enough space. After a while of living with my mum-in-law, Dylan kicked both my little brother ( who has autism) and my dog into the cabin in the back garden. Me and my fiance were angry about this, so we decided to call the socials as it couldn't have been good for Brooklyn, and he never had a choice in it. For some reason, the socials called my mother before going, so my mum went over and helped Dylan move all of Brooklyn's stuff back into the house, so it looked like he still lived in the house. 
My mother then decided to just give the house to Dylan, so I and Brooklyn were gonna end up with nothing out of the house. I was hurt and angry. My brother then accused me and my fiance of sending a picture of their baby with the face burnt out and said he was able to track it back to our local area. We, of course, didn't do this and went to my local post office to see if it was possible to track a letter back, and they said no unless we had purposely put a return address on the back. My brother refuses to let me see my nephew even when I constantly ask. He then randomly said if I apologise I could see my nephew. I didn't think I had anything to apologise for but did it anyway just for the small chance I could see my nephew, but he then said it wasn't good enough. I ended up arguing with my mum about this, and she brought my fiance into it, saying hopefully, she'll grow up and care more about her kid than smoking. I thought this was completely out of order and said she needed to apologise or she wasn't allowed to my son's 1st birthday; she refused to apologise and has now publicly disowned me on Facebook.

He explained that they had separated to try and work on themselves, and in the process they both lost their home, jobs and cars. They moved around for a bit, but ended up back in our town and sleeping in the woods, or under bridges. So Alex asked if he could stay with my boyfriend and I until he got back on his feet. At first it was just going to be Alex, but Aliyah's arrangement fell through, so we allowed her to come as well. They have spent 2 nights so far and I'm not very happy with how it's going.
 
 The first day, my boyfriend picked me up from work, and had both Alex and Aliyah with him. Aliyah ignored and looked straight through me when I tried to greet her. A few minutes later, she complimented my hair and then spent 10 minutes talking about how she hates the specific color that I have in my hair, ""But it's okay cause it looks good on you!"" She also openly admitted to having anger and bipolar issues, and is currently unmedicated. She has been extremely rude, nasty, and generally unappreciative towards me.
 
She yelled at me for bringing her blankets, because they decided they wanted to sleep on our couch after we repeatedly told them to leave the couch alone because it has to be cleaned. She snapped that they didn't need blankets because they had brought their own. My boyfriend explained why we brought the blankets and they ended up using them anyways.

 For the most part they have taken care of themselves, but we've allowed them access to our kitchen for anything they might need. I've let her make coffee and afterwards I noticed that one of my clips to use on the sugar bag has gone missing. It's a very distinct clip, I've had it for a very long time as it holds some sentimental value.I know it sounds crazy, it's a clip for a bag of chips, but I haven't been to the place it came from in over 10 years and all but one of the family members I was with have passed since then. 
 I'm really struggling with this because on one hand, if she did steal it, I don't want a thief in my house. If she didn't steal it and it's just misplaced, where could it have possibly gone?
 
 I'm keeping my guard up with Alex as well, but I feel confident enough to say that he at least won't steal from or treat us horribly. Aliyah on the other hand has shown us many times in the past that she cannot be trusted.
 I don't want to leave her out on the streets by herself, and I want to help her, but I physically cannot do that if she keeps acting the way she is. I can't shake this feeling that something very bad is gonna come out of this situation if we keep her around.

47,1epszoc,AITA for repeatedly snitching on my bratty little brother?,"I, 16F, have a little brother, 12M, who we're gonna call Mike for the sake of this post (and keeping his privacy). 

Ever since my brother was born, I was the closest thing he had to a helicopter mom. Our actual mother had cancer (she's okay now thankfully) early into his childhood meaning that I had to become his primary caretaker.

His teachers, most adults around us really, didn't like that at all. They constantly bugged my parents about how I was ""baby-ing him"" and ""preventing him from growing up"". I mean, what else would you expect from a child raising a child? As someone who experienced bullying and abuse my whole life, I protected him in the best way I could.

Unfortunately, one of the ways I would save his butt when he made a mistake or messed up, was lying. 

See, when you have strict parents, it's like being raised to be a liar. My brother was a terrible liar, though, so he always relied on me to help. Eventually, he started to take advantage of me. He would ask me to 'bargain' with my parents for things, and I'd get in trouble for the repetitive requests. He'd make me bargain for expensive things, too, and it wasn't like he was grateful for anything he got either. 

At one point a few months ago, I got tired of it. My parents always asked me for confirmation when they were suspicious of my brother, so, whenever they asked, I told them the truth. I told them how my brother literally never studied which is why he was getting horrid grades. I told them how my brother often called me a fat cow, a bitch, a no-neck pig, among other things. I never stepped up to them, though. I only snitched if they asked.

Now, here comes the big issue. All I'm doing only seems to make Mike worse. He's angrier, more disrespectful, and refuses to do favors and such without receiving something in return. He also lies straight up to my parents constantly. One time, he lied to a doctor about his diet (he was basically living off chips and soda for the past 2 months and nothing else), and I had to intervene and tell the truth. I mean, it's a doctor, whom we called because of some serious health issues relating to my brother.

49,1epsxtm,AITA for using tough parenting on my son?,"
I (39F) have two sons: my older son (17) and my younger son (13), with my husband (40M). When my older son was growing up, my husband and I were pretty strict. We thought that tough love and high expectations would make him strong and ready for life.

Now that he‚Äôs older, he‚Äôs really into fitness and personal success. He‚Äôs become very critical of anyone who doesn‚Äôt meet his standards, including me and his dad. Recently, he told me that my attempts to show love and affection are pointless and even called his father weak for not being tough enough. This really hurt my husband, who has always tried to support and guide him.

To make things worse, my older son has started calling his younger brother pathetic for letting bullies push him around at school. He tells me that his brother should be tougher and not let people get to him, which upsets me a lot.

He also refuses to celebrate his birthdays or any special occasions. He won‚Äôt accept gifts or even acknowledge them. This makes it even harder because it feels like he‚Äôs shutting out our attempts to show him we care.

My older son is very close to my younger sister, his aunt. She‚Äôs single and he turns to her for support and affection, valuing her praise more than ours. It hurts because he seems to find comfort in her that he won‚Äôt accept from us.

I‚Äôve tried to be more supportive and loving, hoping to fix our relationship. Sometimes I even want to baby him and offer the nurturing he might need, but he pushes that away. He says love and emotional support are pointless, and only his achievements matter. It‚Äôs painful to see him reject our efforts and criticize his dad, who is genuinely hurt by his comments.",Asshole,2024-08-11,"AITA for using tough parenting on my son?

We don‚Äôt get together often, so we decided to go to a slightly nicer restaurant than usual. The reservation was for 7 PM, and everyone confirmed they‚Äôd be there.

On the day of the dinner, one of our friends, ‚ÄúSarah,‚Äù texted about an hour before to say she was feeling tired and might not make it. We all understood and told her to rest up, but she said she would still try to come if she felt better.

We got to the restaurant and ordered appetizers while waiting for Sarah. After about 20 minutes, she texted again to say she wasn‚Äôt going to make it after all. We went ahead and ordered dinner, but since we had initially planned for five people, we had ordered enough food to share with Sarah too (including some pricier dishes she specifically wanted).

When the bill came, it was pretty hefty, and we all chipped in to cover Sarah‚Äôs part since we had already ordered food for her. Later, I messaged Sarah to let her know what happened and asked if she could send me her share. She replied, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even eat, so I shouldn‚Äôt have to pay.‚Äù

This put me in an awkward spot. I understand she didn‚Äôt eat the food, but we had ordered with the expectation that she would be there, and we couldn‚Äôt cancel or return the dishes. Now, I feel like the rest of us ended up paying more because of her last-minute decision.

52,1epso6b,AITA for not telling my friend that I'm bi?,"I have a friend that I've known for about seven years now. About a year ago they came out as queer but I suspected it long before and I was supportive when they did. They've also confided in me about how they grew up in a very unsupportive and hostile community and that they've always felt alienated from other LGBT people and often depressed about it.

Thing is, I'm actually bi but it's tough for me to open up to people so I never brought it up with them in any conversations. But this is an aspect of me that they already know about. Also the other thing is I just don't really consider myself any part of any community, as I'm just me, so I didn't really view it as lying.

Yesterday a mutual friend wanted to hang out so all 3 of us got together and went to hang at the park. She wanted to show us a music video so I pulled out my phone and pulled up YouTube so that we could watch it. After we were done watching it I noticed over the course of the next half hour she was oddly quiet for some reason so I asked what is up.

She asked me if its ok to ask me a question, so I said yes. And that is when she just said ""You don't have to answer, but are you bi""? And naturally I was taken aback so I asked her ""uhh out of curiosity, why?"" and that is when she said she caught a glimpse of grinder app on my phone when I was showing them my phone...

So I just said yes and they were both supportive and chill about it seemingly and we just continued the night. However this morning, the first friend texted me a very long passive aggressive message wanting to know why I didn't open that up to them even though they opened up to me. They were also upset that I kept that information from them even after being told the feeling of alienation from other LGBT people.

55,1eps6hx,AITA For Not Going To A Dinner Party For My GF‚Äôs Birthday?,"My girlfriend (24f) and I (23m) had plans today to visit her parents for a dinner to celebrate her upcoming birthday. While we were getting ready, we were talking about a few friends of ours and how they aren‚Äôt the greatest at building credit and managing finances in general. 

I mentioned how that I‚Äôm glad I was finally in a spot where I can make payments to my student loans and it started an argument. She claimed that I told her I was paying less than I was ($250 biweekly for a $10k loan) which confused me because I specifically remembered telling her that I was paying exactly $250 every two weeks. She absolutely refused to believe I told her that, so I went through our messages and sure enough, there was the message backing me up. I read her the message and she blew up at me screaming ‚Äúwell I guess that means everything is my (referring to herself) f-ing fault‚Äù and ‚Äúwell I guess I‚Äôll just have to figure out my own f-ing financial situation‚Äù (I help her out with some of her debts where I can). This completely shut down any meaningful discussion in my eyes, and is a part of where I might be the asshole, but I just grabbed my keys and went for a drive to clear my head.

My girlfriend (24f) and I (23m) had plans today to visit her parents for a dinner to celebrate her upcoming birthday. While we were getting ready, we were talking about a few friends of ours and how they aren‚Äôt the greatest at building credit and managing finances in general. 

I mentioned how that I‚Äôm glad I was finally in a spot where I can make payments to my student loans and it started an argument. She claimed that I told her I was paying less than I was ($250 biweekly for a $10k loan) which confused me because I specifically remembered telling her that I was paying exactly $250 every two weeks. She absolutely refused to believe I told her that, so I went through our messages and sure enough, there was the message backing me up. I read her the message and she blew up at me screaming ‚Äúwell I guess that means everything is my (referring to herself) f-ing fault‚Äù and ‚Äúwell I guess I‚Äôll just have to figure out my own f-ing financial situation‚Äù (I help her out with some of her debts where I can). This completely shut down any meaningful discussion in my eyes, and is a part of where I might be the asshole, but I just grabbed my keys and went for a drive to clear my head.

57,1epr8zn,WIBTA if I told my mom (61F) either my brother (23M) moves out or I (25F) do?,"My mom and I (a few years ago) planned to buy a 4 bedroom house together, and our deal was I would contribute *$1,000 monthly (until it was paid off) and she would pay utilities so I could save up. I didn‚Äôt plan on moving out for years, but I made sure to explain that buying the house was more an investment (into her) and not an agreement to live there forever.

It all went off the rails when my brother‚Äôs car crapped out. It was leaking oil for days until it stopped working and cost thousands to fix. We thought he used all the money to move to fix his car, but found out later he used credit cards, didn‚Äôt pay them off and was over $10,000 in debt. He‚Äôs been paying it off since then (about 4 years ago). But I have no idea what his financial situation is now.

That was the end of our original plan (that didn‚Äôt include my brother living with us), especially since the house we found cost more than we planned. My mom still got her home office, but my brother got the extra room I was promised in our agreement because he couldn‚Äôt move out. 4 years later and he has no plans of going anywhere.

He doesn‚Äôt clean anything EVER. He calls me a fag/fat/ugly on a daily basis. (I‚Äôm bi, he‚Äôs just one of those ppl who say slurs for fun.) If it was just me and my mom our arrangement would be working out fine, but my brother has been putting a strain on everything.

His financial situation + him still having car payments + our property taxes going up; I‚Äôve had to pay *$1,200 monthly since a year after we moved. I should have made a new financial plan for myself but I have depression and still living with my brother for so long has made it even worse and I haven‚Äôt been able to save.

My job pays pretty well for entry level accounting with no experience, but I will never be able to afford a place of my own while paying my share of the mortgage on my current salary.

I feel really trapped and it sucks because I love my mom. Every time I bring anything up with her about this she sees it as me harping on my brother or being dramatic, and it‚Äôs infuriating! I can‚Äôt stand living with my him. She doesn‚Äôt plan on ever retiring, but I refuse to renege on my end of the deal (paying mortgage until it‚Äôs paid off) even if I didn‚Äôt get everything I was promised.

Aside from depression I have other physical problems that make it difficult for me to do normal things sometimes. I also have extreme fatigue, but I think I really have to buckle down here to get in a better situation. Possibly taking on another role at work and working overtime if they‚Äôll allow or getting a second job.

EDIT/UPDATE: I made a mistake I pay $1200 monthly. I paid $2000 on the place we were renting including my car insurance and that was all the money I made. Original deal was I pay $1000.

63,1epq1pj,AITA for getting angry with my friend because he's back in contact with someone who makes him a bad person?,"
For some background, I met this friend about three to four years ago. We've  only been in touch through text and phone calls. Despite not usually forming close bonds online, something was different with him. We talk almost daily and have a deep connection where we share everything.

He has a history of trauma that still affects his mental health. He recently detailed his past abuses to me, and I‚Äôve always reassured him that I‚Äôm here for him. Our friendship has mostly become about him discussing his problems, and while I‚Äôm here to listen, his tendency to push people away and then mistreat those who remain worries me. People often leave him due to his behavior, or they stay only to use him. I‚Äôve assured him I‚Äôm not like that.

He says I‚Äôm his closest friend, even though we haven‚Äôt met in person for a while. I sometimes wonder if he values our friendship or just clings to me because I‚Äôm the only one who hasn‚Äôt left.

Recently, I discovered he was reconnecting with one of his old abusers and they were becoming close. I had suspected something, but he lied until I pressed for the truth. I got angry and exploded at him.

He seemed oblivious to why I was upset. I told him he lets in the wrong people and needs to address this if he wants to change. He pushes away those who care and lets in those who hurt him. I want to help, but sometimes I feel like he‚Äôs a lost cause.

I‚Äôm not a therapist and can‚Äôt solve his issues, but I felt like I was using common sense at the time. Now that it‚Äôs all blown over, I feel like I‚Äôm in the wrong. He should make his own decisions, but I can‚Äôt bear to see him hurt by someone who‚Äôs harmed him before, even if they apologized. I feel like it was wrong of me to force him to tell me who it was, because I knew it had to be his old abuser.

I believe in second chances, but this person has had many and is a horrible person. He uses my friend for his pleasure and engages in disgusting acts. He brings out the absolute worse in my friend when I‚Äôve tried to get him out. 

My friend said he doesn‚Äôt care about my opinion and that if he gets hurt again, it‚Äôs on him. Part of me feels responsible because he comes to me when he‚Äôs hurt.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-11,"AITA for getting angry with my friend because he's back in contact with someone who makes him a bad person? 
For some background, I met this friend about three to four years ago. We've  only been in touch through text and phone calls. Despite not usually forming close bonds online, something was different with him. We talk almost daily and have a deep connection where we share everything.

He has a history of trauma that still affects his mental health. He recently detailed his past abuses to me, and I‚Äôve always reassured him that I‚Äôm here for him. Our friendship has mostly become about him discussing his problems, and while I‚Äôm here to listen, his tendency to push people away and then mistreat those who remain worries me. People often leave him due to his behavior, or they stay only to use him. I‚Äôve assured him I‚Äôm not like that.

He says I‚Äôm his closest friend, even though we haven‚Äôt met in person for a while. I sometimes wonder if he values our friendship or just clings to me because I‚Äôm the only one who hasn‚Äôt left.

Recently, I discovered he was reconnecting with one of his old abusers and they were becoming close. I had suspected something, but he lied until I pressed for the truth. I got angry and exploded at him.

He seemed oblivious to why I was upset. I told him he lets in the wrong people and needs to address this if he wants to change. He pushes away those who care and lets in those who hurt him. I want to help, but sometimes I feel like he‚Äôs a lost cause.

I‚Äôm not a therapist and can‚Äôt solve his issues, but I felt like I was using common sense at the time. Now that it‚Äôs all blown over, I feel like I‚Äôm in the wrong. He should make his own decisions, but I can‚Äôt bear to see him hurt by someone who‚Äôs harmed him before, even if they apologized. I feel like it was wrong of me to force him to tell me who it was, because I knew it had to be his old abuser.

I believe in second chances, but this person has had many and is a horrible person. He uses my friend for his pleasure and engages in disgusting acts. He brings out the absolute worse in my friend when I‚Äôve tried to get him out. 

My friend said he doesn‚Äôt care about my opinion and that if he gets hurt again, it‚Äôs on him. Part of me feels responsible because he comes to me when he‚Äôs hurt. 

I‚Äôm worried, and though I know he‚Äôs free to make his own choices, I can‚Äôt help but be concerned. I tried to explain why I was angry, but he didn‚Äôt want to listen. I told him he wasn‚Äôt understanding my perspective and haven‚Äôt talked to him since. AITA?",0.0,1.0291496515274048,1,0

70,1epm6ke,"AITA for not naming my daughter after MIL, and neither allowing her to have a special nickname for her granddaughter?","Note: First reddit post, apologies for any formatting errors



I (29F) recently welcomed my daughter Carolyn, about a month back. Her name has been a point of contention with my MIL (Margaret) ever since.

For context, my SIL (husband's sister, Lena, 27F) had her baby daughter two years ago, and named her ""Agatha"", after her own MIL. Needless to say, Granny Agatha was overjoyed. This naming slightly miffed Lena's mom and my MIL (Margaret), as the baby hadn't been names after her, nor given a middle name honoring her. Although she never communicated this with Lena directly, she would make backhanded comments about this.

When MIL found out that me & my husband were having a girl, she assumed we were going to name her Margaret or something similar like Margot - even though we had never said anything as such. For e.g., when we announced the baby's gender at a family gathering, she responded that she ""cannot wait to meet mini Margaret"". I didn't say anything at the time to avoid conflict in front of the entire family, but brought it up in private with my husband later that day. He said that she probably said it ""on a whim"" out of endearment for her granddaughter, since we had not yet decided upon a name at the time.

My husband did bring up honoring MIL, but I vetoed it. He didn't push much either. When we finally did decide upon the name though, a few weeks later, I had a bad feeling about her reaction. I really didn't want someone to constantly pester us/ try to convince us of changing the name just a few weeks before birth, so I told my husband that I wanted to meet the baby first and be fully convinced that she was a ""Carolyn"" before announcing the names.

Unbeknownst to us, all this while, my MIL had been going around telling her friends how the baby was going to be named after her and how they would be Peggy & ""Maggie"" etc. After Carolyn was born and we announced her name to family and friends, my MIL was LIVID. She argued about how we ""broke the tradition"" by choosing a different name ""last minute"". I responded that there my SIL naming her daughter after her own MIL does not constitute/ lay down any ""tradition"" and naming my daughter Margaret/ Margot was never in consideration in the first place. She then claimed that we were embarrassing her in front of all her friends now that she had told them about the granddaughter being named after her. My husband tried to intervene by saying that she can still call the baby Maggie if she'd like and that could be her nickname for Carolyn, but by that point, I was so mad over the situation that I refused to let that happen.

Me & my husband later had a mini argument over this, and he said that although he understands that MIL is being a bit unreasonable, I was being too harsh by not even allowing Maggie as a nickname for her. I said that I would have considered doing so had she not gone behind our backs and spread the word about the baby being named after her, and later arguing/ accusing us of embarrassing her.

72,1epm05y,AITA: For not giving a car to my sister,"Context: I (42M) own two cars, One is a 2008 BMW M5 (I bought it for use on long journeys and trips up and down the motorway) and the other is a 2018 Kia Picanto (For use in the city/As my wife's learner car too). Every 3-4 years  I switch out the city car for a used model between 1-3 years old just so we have newer technology and such.

Normally we trade in our old on but this time we decided that we keep out old picanto and that we should give my dad( who needed a new one at the time after his got crashed) a brand new car. So we bought a car for my dad and drove it over, for a family dinner and we showed them around it (under the excuse that it was my wife's new car) and then we decided to hand over the keys to my dad (who was shocked) and helped with the paperwork sign. We were happy that he and my mum liked it.

However, my sister (33F) was less than pleased. She was struggling after losing two jobs in a row and had to sell her car to pay off some debt. Was angry that my dad got a car and not her. When she told me this I was **fuming**. My dad worked so hard to provide a good education for us both and because she didn't use that blessing she was struggling and expected me to give her it instead. So I told my dad what happened and they were shocked. They supported what i said and this caused my sister to leave.

However the next day she messaged me and my wife repeatedly trying to ""apologize"" at which point I called her and told her to ""stop, im at work"" and she called me a asshole for not accepting her apology and told me i could ""Rot in hell"". Then i blocked her

*My dad needed a car, he asked me if i could find him a car and i found one and bought him it so he doesn't have to waste his money on some beater If my sister needed a car she could of brought it up and maybe we could of helped out.*",Not the A-hole,2024-08-11,"AITA: For not giving a car to my sister Context: I (42M) own two cars, One is a 2008 BMW M5 (I bought it for use on long journeys and trips up and down the motorway) and the other is a 2018 Kia Picanto (For use in the city/As my wife's learner car too). Every 3-4 years  I switch out the city car for a used model between 1-3 years old just so we have newer technology and such.

Normally we trade in our old on but this time we decided that we keep out old picanto and that we should give my dad( who needed a new one at the time after his got crashed) a brand new car. So we bought a car for my dad and drove it over, for a family dinner and we showed them around it (under the excuse that it was my wife's new car) and then we decided to hand over the keys to my dad (who was shocked) and helped with the paperwork sign. We were happy that he and my mum liked it.

However, my sister (33F) was less than pleased. She was struggling after losing two jobs in a row and had to sell her car to pay off some debt. Was angry that my dad got a car and not her. When she told me this I was **fuming**. My dad worked so hard to provide a good education for us both and because she didn't use that blessing she was struggling and expected me to give her it instead. So I told my dad what happened and they were shocked. They supported what i said and this caused my sister to leave.

However the next day she messaged me and my wife repeatedly trying to ""apologize"" at which point I called her and told her to ""stop, im at work"" and she called me a asshole for not accepting her apology and told me i could ""Rot in hell"". Then i blocked her

Im interested in seeing what you guys have to say! AITA?

73,1epleg8,AITA: I didnt invite a kid to my sons birthday party,"Hello, (Throwaway account, made just for this).

Context - My son (8M) is a quiet person, he doesn't like to make a show of things and likes to keep things to himself. This made it hard for him to make friends but i didn't want to force him to have any but when he was 6 he asked if he could join a small art group they were forming at his school, which i did, and he went on to make friends with 3 other kids who were exactly like him and since then and i keep in contact with all the parents to arrange gatherings or days out and they are the only friends he ever talked about or mentioned to me.

So, to throw my sons 8th birthday party i contacted the parents of my sons friends and checked if they could come. (They said yes)

I asked my son if he wanted anyone else to come and he said no, so i sent out the invites with my son to give to his friends at school and thought nothing of it, But when i went to pick up my son some lady who i have never seen before comes up to me, she asked me if it was my sons birthday and why her son wasn't invited. I was really confused at the time so i asked my kiddo if it was one of his friends to which he said no. I was then even more confused and asked why she wants a invite to which she says my son was promising her son a place and his party and that she had already made plans for the time the party was happening.

I then thought this must be some sort of joke and told her to make new plans and that her son will not be invited if he isn't a friend of my son. She started saying something but by then i really couldn't be asked, so i got in my car and left as i had more important things to do.

The next day when i went to drop my son off at a music lesson and i saw her there. She gave me dirty looks and when i walked past she called me a asshole.

So reddit, AITA?

74,1epl00w,AITA for not asking my parents any questions about the situation with my dad's other daughter?,"Let me start with the background. Dad has a daughter from his first marriage. She's in her 20s now. Mid to late 20s to be a little clearer but not super sure on her age. My parents got married when she was 5. During my mom's pregnancy with me (18F) and my twin brother (18M) there was a big fight with my dad's ex wife. She went crazy. This all went down in front of dad's daughter. My mom ended up calling the police and my dad's ex was arrested.

Dad's daughter never forgave my mom for this. I don't have a ton of memories of her living with us but I do remember her bringing it up a lot. She used to tell mom she would have earned what she got from her mom. She called my mom bitch a lot. She brought up the police incident so many times. I even remember one night hearing her scream at 9pm at night that my mom got her mom arrested and she wished my mom had dropped dead ever since.

Dad's daughter wanted nothing to do with me and my brother. We're used to it. We don't miss her or feel sad we're not closer to her.

My parents never talked about the incident or the trouble with dad's daughter, with us. That is until a week ago. They asked us to sit down with them and they told us there had been a fight, dad's ex got arrested, his daughter hadn't liked it. They asked if we had any questions and we both said no. This caught them off guard and they were like are you sure, you're double sure, you really have no questions to ask us about this after all this time. I told them we always knew what went down. So we didn't really need to ask. Mom said surely we wanted to get their side of things instead of assuming. I said it didn't matter because the end result was the same. I told them the fact dad's ex didn't get any custody back for years says a lot about what happened.

My parents told me this was such a big deal to our family that I should have questions and I should be more curious about their side. I told them it was just a reality for us and we never had to wonder because we grew up aware. They said we were being very off about something so huge in our family and we should take more of an interest in the family and the dynamic because it could have consequences in the relationship with our ""sister"". I said I really had none and they accused me of not taking it seriously.

75,1epko0j,AITA for ruining my sister's wedding and honeymoon?,"So I (20F) have an older sister (30F), who I'll call Emily. Emily got married 2 months ago to her partner Danny (34M). My siblings and I grew up together and Emily was a huge influence, along with my other older sister Mary (27F). They were both wild and so, from a young age, I knew a lot more than I was supposed to (about partying, dating etc. nothing weird or scandalous really). Mary got married 4 years ago and I'm really close to my brother in law. He knows about her partying, drinking and pretty much everything else she did and he never had a problem with any of it. Well, I've met Danny only a handful of times since they live far away and so I assumed they talked about it all. Come wedding rehearsal (the day before), we started sharing interesting stories from our childhood. Danny asked me how come I've never dated, drank or partied. I, not even thinking it might be a big deal, said that after hearing all the stories from my older sisters, never really wanted to or felt the need to. Danny looked a bit confused but said nothing. Mary just glared at me. Later, Mary told me Danny knew nothing of Emily's ""wild days"". I apologized to Emily and she told me it wasn't a big deal. I hadn't thought about it in two months, but Emily and Danny visited us yesterday. Danny was as nice as ever, while Emily was a bit standoffish. While Danny was out with our dad, Mary and Emily ganged up on me and told me Danny was mad at Emily for lying and that I ruined their wedding and honeymoon. My mom heard  us talking, came into the room and chewed out my sisters for blaming me for Emily's lies. After they went to my sister's place (they were gonna stay with her for a couple of days prior to this incident), I started feeling anxious and bad about what happened and the part I played in it. My mom told my dad and brother what happened and they both said I did nothing wrong and my dad said he would make my sisters apologize, but I don't want them to get involved. So, AITA for ruining my sister's wedding and honeymoon?

UPDATE:

Hello everyone üëã Thank you all for answering and reaching out privately. We did have the ""dreaded"" talk, but first, I'd like to address some comments and concerns.
My BIL asked because, while pretty much everyone drank alcohol, I didn't. It wasn't ill intended and there was no hidden agenda.
Emily, to my knowledge, never partook in any criminal behavior.
They are all Orthodox Christians (I'm an Atheist), while Danny is Catholic. I don't even know if Danny knows I'm an Atheist, since we haven't really talked about religion outside of the wedding. I don't think this had much of an impact, bit I noticed some people were wondering. We are NOT in a cult. üòÇ
Both of my brothers in law are lovely people. They could be considered a bit more ""uptight"", but they truly are good people.
Who and how many people my sister had slept with is no one's business and I will not indulge in discussing it, nor will I shame anyone for it.
Yes, I did say stories from my sisters, which do include a lot of stories about other people. So, in reality, I didn't really reveal anything.
I wish by sister and BIL nothing but the best and, of course, a lasting and healthy marriage with communication.
My sisters aren't idiots (well, they are, but not how you think (sibling compliment)). And no, my BIL isn't interested in me more than my sister (I can't evenüòÇ). Our family dynamic is fine, it truly was, in our opinion, a stupid misunderstanding.
Sorry, I know this is already long, but onto THE TALK.
Basically, my sister and BIL are both idiots (with much love). Turns out my BIL was upset she didn't tell him everything, but he got over it quickly. He didn't mention anything for almost 2 months because he thought Emily was upset with herself and the situation, so he didn't want to make it worse. Now, my sweet idiot sister though something similar, that he was upset with her, so she didn't want to make the situation worse than it already was. So, basically, the wedding and honeymoon were ""ruined"" because they had an awful case of worrying about the other one and walking on eggshells around one another. My BIL was never upset with me and my sister wasn't really upset with me either.
Before visiting us yesterday, Emily went out for a coffee with her friend Lexi (~30F). Lexi had always been... Interesting... She's one of those people who only care about themselves and are never happy for their friends. Don't ask me how Emily hadn't noticed. As friends do, Emily confided in Lexi and she told her Danny is probably preparing to leave her and that's why he's distant (plus that she deserved it). So Emily went to my sister's upset and later we had the disagreement. 
Both Mary and Emily sincerely apologized for attacking me and to the rest of the fam for the stress.
Later yesterday, they went to my sister's and Emily started crying while she thought Danny was out. Danny heard her and they finally talked it through. Their conclusion was that they were both idiots.üòÇ
The cherry on top was the fact that, about a week before visiting us, Emily found out she was pregnant (pre wedding baby, I was told). So, when she went to my sister crying about a possible divorce, she told her she was pregnant. I guess that's why Mary took her side. I apologized to both Emily and Danny for the part I played in this mess and they said what y'all said too, that I can't lie about something if I don't know I'm supposed to and that I shouldn't have been put in that position in the first place.
So, as of now, Lexi is out, we're all fine and I'm getting a nibling next year. And Danny and Emily decided to have a do over honeymoon on their anniversary next year with the BeBe (Moira Rose anyone?).
All i all, probably a disappointing update for some, but I couldn't be happier with the outcome.

76,1epkd9w,AITA regarding this Japan trip with my friend,"I'm F18 and my friend is F17, we have wanted to go to Japan sometime this December or January next year. However, our parents are concerned about our safety and wants someone else to come with us. We have then had some conversations between ourselves, likewise with our parents having conversations with each other. Some suggestions were like inviting my friend's little brother M15 and/or my cousin M18.

However, the problem arised recently when my friend mentioned her mum is coming. It also turned out that she has been begging her mum to come with us and that she didn't really want to go without her mum. My issue is, every single place we have been to, our parents were always with us. Additionally, if her mum comes, her brother would most likely be coming as well, which pretty much makes a family vacation for her and me being a plus one when this was proposed as a trip between us only. 

Her reasons for wanting her mum to come are:

* her dad does not want her to go if there isn't an adult with us and that I'm not adult enough **\[main reason\]**
* it takes the stress off of handling hotel keys, luggage transportation, random documentation that's required to enter the country
* she doesn't think she's responsible enough to navigate around a foreign country
* always better to have an adult around just in case an emergency happens
* her mum tagging along with us makes her feel safer (includes coming to e.g. Tokyo DisneyLand, etc)
* her mum is paying for the trip so she should just spend a little bit more and come with us
* she wants to share new experiences with them (including her little brother)

Since her mum was coming and potentially her brother, she suggested for me to invite my mum and cousin to make it fair, but my mum doesn't know if she even wants to go and it might be awkward for my cousin. I initially just said my cousin could just come with us, but she said she did not feel comfortable being with a stranger, which is fair, but I don't feel comfortable having an adult there either. Moreover, she could always befriend my cousin, I cannot possibly befriend her mum plus, that would be weird. 

I just don't think having her mum there would be fun and it's my first time going to Japan so I want to have  a good experience. However, her response was that her first time at Japan wasn't fun because of her aunt. Additionally, she said that it is going to be fun with or without her mum, and that having her mum there would be more fun. 

In response to that, I said her wanting her mum to come is just for her own benefits like why would her mum also take over my responsibilities. I understand she enjoys being in her family's presence, but she's with them 24/7. So, AITA for wanting to travel somewhere without parents for once and have the freedom to do whatever?

77,1epjn04,AITA for not letting my mother's boyfriend move in with us even though he has a medical condition?,"I‚Äôm 19 years old and live with my two siblings (one under 18) and our mother. A few years ago, we had to remove our father from the family because he physically abused our mother, which left us all emotionally scarred. Since then, my mom has met someone new, and she says he's the person she wants to spend the rest of her life with.

This man lives in another country, and we‚Äôve had a bad impression of him due to frequent arguments with our mom. We also learned that he drinks heavily in the afternoons. Last year, with very short notice and without our full agreement, our mom brought him to live with us.

To be fair, he can be a nice guy when sober and is usually pleasant during the day. He has never physically harmed us or our mom. However, he tends to drink in the afternoon, which, while not daily, often leads to trouble. His drinking causes arguments with our mom that can escalate (though not physically), and my siblings and I feel compelled to step in to protect her.

Things got particularly bad during one incident when he said he wouldn‚Äôt be coming back and left the house. However, he later returned and started kicking the door while insulting my mom. This was frightening, especially since we have a minor in the house. I ended up having a heated argument with him, during which he also insulted me. Out of respect for our mom‚Äôs feelings, we didn‚Äôt call the cops, but after this, my siblings and I decided he could no longer stay with us. Our mom disagreed, but we stood firm.

This situation has also made our relationship with our mother a bit distant, as she continues to side with him despite his behavior. Everything has been fine for the past year, but now a new situation has arisen. Her boyfriend has epilepsy and frequently experiences seizures. He lives alone and doesn‚Äôt have any close family or friends. His doctors have recommended that someone stay with him for his health. Now, our mom is asking if he can come back to live with us.

A few years ago, we had to remove our father from the family because he physically abused our mother, which left us all emotionally scarred. Since then, my mom has met someone new, and she says he's the person she wants to spend the rest of her life with.

This man lives in another country, and we‚Äôve had a bad impression of him due to frequent arguments with our mom. We also learned that he drinks heavily in the afternoons. Last year, with very short notice and without our full agreement, our mom brought him to live with us.

To be fair, he can be a nice guy when sober and is usually pleasant during the day. He has never physically harmed us or our mom. However, he tends to drink in the afternoon, which, while not daily, often leads to trouble. His drinking causes arguments with our mom that can escalate (though not physically), and my siblings and I feel compelled to step in to protect her.

Things got particularly bad during one incident when he said he wouldn‚Äôt be coming back and left the house. However, he later returned and started kicking the door while insulting my mom. This was frightening, especially since we have a minor in the house. I ended up having a heated argument with him, during which he also insulted me. Out of respect for our mom‚Äôs feelings, we didn‚Äôt call the cops, but after this, my siblings and I decided he could no longer stay with us. Our mom disagreed, but we stood firm.

This situation has also made our relationship with our mother a bit distant, as she continues to side with him despite his behavior. Everything has been fine for the past year, but now a new situation has arisen. Her boyfriend has epilepsy and frequently experiences seizures. He lives alone and doesn‚Äôt have any close family or friends. His doctors have recommended that someone stay with him for his health. Now, our mom is asking if he can come back to live with us.

78,1epirqf,AITA for leaving home 2 months after my father got ill? ,"My father was diagnosed with a severe form of cancer in July, and we are all struggling to cope. I don‚Äôt live with my family, but I have a flexible job until mid-October, so I decided to spend almost 2 months (half of July, all of August, plus 1-2 weeks in October) with my mother, even though I can barely concentrate while working from home. He‚Äôs in the hospital, but I‚Äôm also visiting him, even though we are not allowed to stay too long‚Äîusually a half-hour every other day.

I decided to help my mom organize her life alone during these two months and then, in September, return to my normal life.

I even planned to work for a few weeks in September from somewhere by the seaside where I can leave my phone in the room for a while to concentrate better on the readings fir my work and also to recharge, as I usually do whenever I have the chance. However, this would only be from somewhere I can quickly fly home if there‚Äôs an emergency‚Äîand only if the situation doesn‚Äôt get too bad, of course. (He has a 50% chance of going into remission by then, but the illness can always reappear in the next five years.)

I told my mother I would probably leave town at the end of August and come back once more at the beginning of October. She got really mad, told me I‚Äôm completely selfish, and said I can already leave her alone if that‚Äôs what I really need or if I think this time is fine for a vacation. (She‚Äôs always clinging on me, it‚Äôs not so out of ordinary, but now there‚Äôs a reason to it.) 

I have always HATED this town, and now none of my friends live here either, so I basically have to stay cooped up in my mom‚Äôs home, partly without my SO, for at least three months, according to her wishes. There would be rare exceptions when some old friends visit, though. 

I‚Äôm already struggling to cope with the situation (my father and I are very close), and my work is intellectual, requiring a lot of concentration and no distractions. This environment makes it difficult. And it makes me depressed. 

It is true that my mom also needs some practical help, but I hoped we could get it done this month.

Am I the asshole for wanting to leave, or is she exaggerating?

Unfortunately, nada. The only maybe-option won't work since it'd take months, and I needed a laptop for my school program (next month) AND because I will need serious surgery in the very near future, so I wanted something I could use in the hospital.

The coworker later said if I can't find a way to get it covered, they can pay ""half of the cost of repair or replacement or whatever."" It is better than 0, but if the roles were switched I know I'd pay it in full

84,1ephi9d,AITA for not apologizing after giving my sister very blunt answer when she asked me what she should do?,"My sister has never been happy with her husband. That's just a fact. She has stated it herself many times that even her wedding day was very imperfect and she was upset throughout different parts of the day. The problem as I see it is my sister married her husband for love but did not think about the long term dynamics of whether they'd be happy when his son, who was young when my sister married her husband, didn't like my sister and was incredibly standoffish with her. There were comments made back then that things would be different when he was older and he just needed to get to know her and I always wondered why not have that happen BEFORE marriage. But it was never really my business. My sister told everyone she spoke to at the time that she didn't want to hear negativity about her marriage or her decision to marry her husband while his son wasn't on board.

I don't remember a time in the last decade where my sister genuinely seemed happy. She has been focused on changing things with her stepson and giving all her attention to that relationship. It bothers her that even now that he's 19 and no longer living with her and her husband, he still hasn't grown to appreciate her (the way she describes it). People have told her she doesn't need to get so worked up over it anymore because he's out of the house and she can focus on her marriage. Nope. That's still an obsession of hers.

In the last few months she has been far more open about her unhappiness with her family life and not being happy ever with it. So when she came to me and told me she wanted advice on what she should do next. I told her very bluntly that she should leave her husband because after all this time of being unhappy and her fixation on her stepson not liking her, I don't think it's healthy to stay and I do not think she can find happiness when it's very clear her stepson will not be warming up to her anytime in the near future. I told her that appears to matter more to her than anything which is not a good sign for her marriage. She took it okay for a couple of minutes. I thought she was acknowledging my point at least. But then she accused me of being ""cold"" about it and ""flippant"" and she told me people don't just toss away happy marriages for other stuff. I told her she has been saying for years the marriage isn't happy. She told me its' the family, not the marriage, that is unhappy. I told her she takes it as the same thing. Because even with her stepson out of the house she's not happy and she could focus just on the marriage now.

She stormed out and then a few days later she asked where her apology was and why I hadn't made amends for what I said. I told her she asked for my opinion on what she should do and I gave it to her. I said blunt was all she hadn't heard yet so I believed she needed to hear it. She told me it wasn't my place to be blunt. I told her she asked me a question and I answered. She said I was an even bigger asshole for not apologizing.

The problem as I see it is my sister married her husband for love but did not think about the long term dynamics of whether they'd be happy when his son, who was young when my sister married her husband, didn't like my sister and was incredibly standoffish with her. There were comments made back then that things would be different when he was older and he just needed to get to know her and I always wondered why not have that happen BEFORE marriage. But it was never really my business. My sister told everyone she spoke to at the time that she didn't want to hear negativity about her marriage or her decision to marry her husband while his son wasn't on board.

I don't remember a time in the last decade where my sister genuinely seemed happy. She has been focused on changing things with her stepson and giving all her attention to that relationship. It bothers her that even now that he's 19 and no longer living with her and her husband, he still hasn't grown to appreciate her (the way she describes it). People have told her she doesn't need to get so worked up over it anymore because he's out of the house and she can focus on her marriage. Nope. That's still an obsession of hers.

In the last few months she has been far more open about her unhappiness with her family life and not being happy ever with it. So when she came to me and told me she wanted advice on what she should do next. I told her very bluntly that she should leave her husband because after all this time of being unhappy and her fixation on her stepson not liking her, I don't think it's healthy to stay and I do not think she can find happiness when it's very clear her stepson will not be warming up to her anytime in the near future. I told her that appears to matter more to her than anything which is not a good sign for her marriage. She took it okay for a couple of minutes. I thought she was acknowledging my point at least. But then she accused me of being ""cold"" about it and ""flippant"" and she told me people don't just toss away happy marriages for other stuff. I told her she has been saying for years the marriage isn't happy. She told me its' the family, not the marriage, that is unhappy. I told her she takes it as the same thing. Because even with her stepson out of the house she's not happy and she could focus just on the marriage now.

She stormed out and then a few days later she asked where her apology was and why I hadn't made amends for what I said. I told her she asked for my opinion on what she should do and I gave it to her. I said blunt was all she hadn't heard yet so I believed she needed to hear it. She told me it wasn't my place to be blunt. I told her she asked me a question and I answered. She said I was an even bigger asshole for not apologizing.

85,1eph4bm,AITA for telling my friend its her fault for the reason why her life is the way it is right now?,"so I (f20) have been friends with my close friend Kim (f19) since middle school. We would always do everything together such as hang out, match clothes, and in general enjoy each others presence. From then until now, everything has been going down hill. you see, kim suffers with depression and for as long as I know has done NOTHING to get any help for it. I've recommended her several free therapy places and she's would still brush it off and say she's fine when she know she's not.

Kim has done several other things other than get the help she needs such as shaming others for how the look, shaming people for their weight, make rumors about people, and even gone as far as to steal people's boyfriends and justify it by saying ""I have my needs and wants."" and then would break up with them the very next day. I decided to stop being friends with Kim in early 2023 and haven't contacted her since but what I've heard from other close friends, she's doing much worse than before I left her.

Apparently, she's been spreading very harmful rumors about different people and these weren't your obvious rumors, No. She would go as far as to claim that one of her friends caused her depression just because that friend decided to sneak around and sleep with her dad (which is obviously fake and so fucking ridiculous.) I didn't bother to check on Kim just because why would I bother to talk to someone that does something and blames it on one of their mental disorders and never takes accountability?

last week, I ran into Kim at the mall while I was buying some legos for my boyfriend and we talked for a bit and let me say this now, Kim looked HORRIBLE. Her hair was all dead, she had dark bags under her eyes, she looked so underweight, and she had scars and bruises on her legs and arms from obvious reasons (self-inflicted.) She talked to me about how terrible life has been for her and how her dad basically kicked her out because Kim kept stealing money from her father, lost almost all her friends, and got blasted on social media for sleeping with someone's husband. I told her ""well, I don't know what to tell you love. You decided to make this decision for yourself and you know the phrase 'whatever goes around comes back around"" and it came back around to you. That's your own fault you made those decisions for yourself and there's no one else to really blame but yourself, Kim."" after I said that, she stormed off in a rage and I later got a text from my friend Lauren (f20) that Kim apparently texted her about how terrible of a person I was for what I said.

I explained to Lauren that it isn't my fault that no one gave Kim a reality check and I did. It's not my fault she even made her life that way and attempted to make everyone around her miserable for it. Lauren hasn't messaged me since that day and I don't plan to message her any time soon.

I just turned 15 and my sister turned 13 a week before, and she had gotten a $50 from my mum to go online shopping from anywhere and we‚Äôre going to Sydney in October for the SIX musical. For my birthday yesterday we went to a play which cost $35 dollars each person, when for her it is $65 or more (I cannot tell the exact price as my mum booked it) we went to an all you can eat buffet which cost about $170 for all five of us including my sister. 

When I asked my mum if I was getting money too she said that she just spent $370 dollars on me, however, I was only one person, the rest of the money was used for others too (I did not choose the buffet, my mum chose it because it would be easier because we only had 20 minutes to eat so we couldn‚Äôt wait for orders) my mum‚Äôs argument was ‚ÄúI spent a lot of money on you, you don‚Äôt need the money, you already have some‚Äù money I worked for. My argument was that my sisters play cost way more and that she also has to pay for accommodation and food there too she said that I was also going to that play and I was staying there but didn‚Äôt like it when I said that she went to the play and buffet too but my mum didn‚Äôt want to hear a bar of it.
I tried telling my friend about it and my siblings (4 of them) and my mum were calling me ungrateful because I wanted $50. Now I did get money from my dad and grandma $200 all together, and it may seem that I am ungrateful because I have that money to use but my sister had also gotten money off my grandma who isn‚Äôt even her grandma.

I (19F) come from a decently large family. I have 2 siblings, 16M and 22F. My mother(46F) was the second of 6 children, with her brother being the oldest and 4 younger sisters. I'm not sure of their exact ages, but they were all born in the span of less than 13 years. My maternal grandparents were divorced long before I was born, and my grandmother remarried when I was 5 to a man who has always been my grandfather in every way besides genetics.

2 years ago, my brother was diagnosed with a rare mental disorder. My brother's case is more severe than mine, which is why he was able to be diagnosed before me, despite this disorder rarely being diagnosed in kids and teens. I am still in the process of recieving a proper diagnosis, but I have been tested and the results show I most likely have it. Our mother didn't take the news well and told my brother he didn't know anything about the disorder. She then said that the reason she knew better was that her mother had it, so she knew what it was like. Along with several other incidents in the past years, our relationship with our mother is strained.

In may, i posted a tiktok video about my grandmother and i having the disorder. That video got more than 50k views, which for an account as small as mine was insane. Unfortunately, someone from my family saw the video and showed it to everyone. My grandmother texted not me, but my mother and asked me to take it down. Then she went on to say that she knew I was faking because it was a ""tiktok trend."" I had been posting content about this disorder for 2 years at this point. This was especially harmful because I hadn't told my mother that I was seeking a diagnosis or even thought I had the disorder, and she did not react well. I took the account down, but it didn't end there. Several relatives spead vicious, untrue rumors about my brother and I, turning the rest of the family against us too.

Now, my grandmother's 70th birthday is in a few weeks. It seems like my grandmother might be trying to reconnect, but I'm honestly not sure I want to. I looked up to her in the past, but after everything that's happened, I can't see her the same way. I have no idea how to explain this to my mom, and I don't think she'll listen anyway. I know that my relatives won't forgive me if I cut her off. I will always have my siblings, who've been through hell and back with me, and I have great friends and an amazing partner, but it would still hurt. I feel like my choices are between a family that can't accept and respect me, or no family at all. I already cut off my abusive father and his entire family when I was 14, I didn't think I'd have to make that choice twice. I hate this.

ETA: My account was very small, less than 2k followers. After posting for 2 years, it was about venting, not ""clout"" as some suggested. I also never posted any identifying info for myself or my grandmother other than my face, and I had posted venting about family struggles before. The video literally only mentioned the existence of my grandmother and the fact that she also had the disorder, nothing else. The rest of the video, like the rest of my account, was about me. It was stupid, but I somehow believed that they would never see it or be hurt by it even though the account was public. 

Secondly, the only reason I don't hsve a diagnosis is because the process is long, arduous, and expensive and I'm doing it all without help. I have done years of research and my doctors agree that i have this disorder, it is simply hard to formally diagnose because it is so rare. I didn't spend the last year since becoming a legal adult going to one specialist appointment after another just for my having this disorder to be invalidated in a comment section. My case is almost identical to my brother's and we talk all the time about our shared experiences. We each understand each other in a way no one else in our house can.

Also, my grandmother took part in spreading rumors along with the rest of the family, such as lies that ny brother and I had hurt our younger cousins. This not only didn't happen, but makes no sense because we were always very close and protective with them. My brother had no part in the video and had done nothing wrong. I am very protective over him after what we went through in our father's home. More than her reaction to the tiktok, this is why I want nothing to do with her.

For some context, I (20 F) and my partner (20 M) got together a year and a half ago and have since been living together with his family. My partner and I had grown into loving cars since I met him and it's something we can both bond over the same interest. 

We are currently strained financially but we are managing things to the best of our abilities. Sometimes I have to help out my partner more with money which leaves me with less to spend myself, and I'm not getting paid a lot. My family likes to make comments about my finances and situations I get myself into but I just take it usually. 

I wanted to sell my car that I have been fully paying for this whole year. The car was a gift from my mum and she gave it to me once I had gotten my license and she had upgraded to a nice 2020 car. My mum had that car for over 10 years, I know it's sentimental to her and more than just a car. However, I wanted to upgrade my car and in order to do that, I needed to sell my car to get the car I'm looking at getting. I wouldn't have been able to achieve this without selling the car for cash for a deposit. I also didn't think I would be able to afford to pay for two cars so I thought it was best to sell it. 

I had gone to tell my mum what my plans were and that I wanted to get a car that I really want, but my mum stormed off on me. Which she never does because I usually always play it safe and never done anything to be in my mum's bad books. We never fight, but this triggered her more than I've ever seen her. She then started harassing me over text about how ""I shouldn't have ever given you that car"", ""give me the keys I won't let you sell her"" and ""if you go through with this I'm disowning you"". 

She was saying that the car was still hers even though legally it was mine. She said how my partner is a bad influence and so is his family, which is not true because this was my idea alone. My partner doesn't egg on bad ideas, he only supports whatever I want to do, which isn't something my family does. I feel that my mum is hypocritical since she had gotten a loan for her new car. And then she says that my partner is bad for getting a loan on his? They are both the same price of cars they both have. I feel she thinks since she is older it's okay but since he's young, he can't do it too. 

Since I had sold my car, my family has been giving me shit and my sister said ""once you get the car back, you get the family back"" after some thoughtful messages she had sent me. She agrues that it was the family's car and that my mum paid for the car even though that was 10+ years ago. She also said I deserved to be disowned.

92,1epgfzi,AITA for how I handled my brother‚Äôs girlfriend‚Äôs comments about my boyfriend?,"

I (22F) recently introduced my boyfriend (23M) to my family for the first time. My brother (19M) and his girlfriend (21F) were there as well. For some context, my brother is 6'5"", his girlfriend is 6'2"", and my boyfriend is 5'9"".

When my brother first saw my boyfriend, he looked at me with a surprised expression and said, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you liked younger men.‚Äù I was taken aback and immediately corrected him, saying that my boyfriend is actually older than both of us. My brother looked a little embarrassed and apologized, saying he genuinely thought my boyfriend was 18 or something.

That could have been the end of it, but then his girlfriend decided to chime in, making things worse. She started by teasing my boyfriend about his height, saying things like, ‚ÄúAw, it‚Äôs so cute how you‚Äôre shorter than me and [brother‚Äôs name],‚Äù and then escalated to calling him ""quite pitiful."" She even joked, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like you‚Äôre a little kid standing next to him. How does that even work?‚Äù

My brother, seeing that things were getting uncomfortable, told her to shut up, but she just rolled her eyes and said, ‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù in a sarcastic tone. After that, she didn‚Äôt even bother paying attention to us and spent the rest of the dinner clinging to my brother, barely engaging with anyone else.

The rest of the dinner was fine, but the damage had already been done. My boyfriend was polite throughout, but later, when we were alone, he admitted he felt humiliated and was upset that my brother‚Äôs girlfriend would be so rude.

After the dinner, my brother made her apologize, but it was clear she didn‚Äôt mean it and was only doing it because he made her.

I‚Äôm really mad at both my brother and his girlfriend. While my brother did apologize, the whole situation has left a bad taste in my mouth, and I haven‚Äôt spoken to either of them since. My brother insists I‚Äôm overreacting and that it was all just a joke.

93,1epg39v,AITA for refusing to take my 15months daughter to my dad?,"Hey,

So my family has issues with my marriage apparently because my sister hates my wife. This hatred caused too many issues to me, and I was not a dumb man to listen to my parents and divorce my wife cuz my sister hates her guts lol. One time, my sister couldn't control herself, and she threw the gifts my wife brought right into her face, saying she's worth more than a simple gift!!!! Ever since then, things have been tense between me and my family, cuz they'd always keep asking me to divorce my wife if I want our family to not be taken apart by this snake!!1! (we are a family of four, me and my sister, and my parents).

I never listened to them, and frankly my wife hasn't been in touch with them ever since the . Every attempt we made ended up being useless, as it would circle back to this almighty sister.

Anyways, my family is now out of the country cuz they went with my sister so she can study abroad! (shes a 32yo grown woman)

While theyre abroad, my wife gave birth to their very first grandchild... I made attempts at first by video calls to let them see their granddaughter, but every time I call I get the same things said (we will never be able to see her!! ur wife plan succeeded congrats!!) 

I ignored that, and now 15months after, my dad comes back home for work. Last night he texts me he's home, and he wants me to bring him my daughter to see her at 12pm. I told him it's unreasonable to 1) ask out of the blue, 2) i didn't even hear anything about you coming back when I was literally talking to you yesterday, 3) I can't drive 30+ mins in the middle of the heat (52c at the time) with my daughter. So instead I told him to come over, sends him the address and that hes more than welcome to see her. 

He says ok, but then few mins after he calls me back saying no i need her here in this hotel im in, we have fun kids activities, so i will come to ur address and you will bring her in the car so I can take her to the hotel. I respectfully tell him that's unreasonable, and it's better to come instead. He then flips off and says no fkn way im coming to ur house, u either bring her, or ill come to u at 2pm for lunch. Im like ok come for lunch sure??? 

Naive me didn't know what would happen, so me and my wife get lunch ready. He texts me then saying hes at X restaurant, and that I should come with my daughter there... I told him sorry, that can't happen. I can come alone and see you since I haven't seen you in a while. So I go alone, and he then starts a video call with my mom and sister saying I came alone and that im preventing him from seeing my daughter????

But I know for an almost fact that he is going to RUIN her credit if this happens, and I feel like no one is realizing this with his track record. We had lunch with my uncle who‚Äôs our car salesman; but I didn‚Äôt know this would come up at lunch. My mom and uncle both asked me what I think of this decision, my brother sitting right across from me.

I‚Äôm not trying to call you out but you already haven‚Äôt taken care of your own credit.‚Äù (He opened up a credit card last year and made no payments, ruined his credit) I asked him how he‚Äôs going to pay this because he has no job?

I asked if they‚Äôre all sure this is a good idea, maybe waiting until he has a job or can work instead of having a car fall into his lap and he just kept saying ‚Äúyeah I get it.‚Äù But I got frustrated and I told him ‚Äúyou get it? But you were stealing money from mom a few days ago?‚Äù And he went ‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù I told him ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm really not trying to take any opportunity away from you but this is not a responsible decision to make.‚Äù Because it‚Äôs not.

95,1epfrt6,AITA for lashing out at my friends after they went back on their word?,"Truncated for word limit.

I've been rooming with my friends for a few years. It knew they wanted to live on their own as they're engaged. But in this economy, I can't afford to live on my own. (I make 14/hr [post-tax] and live in a city.) I didn't want to live with them forever. But they were letting me stay with them until I could afford to live on my own. I have anxiety and was worried that they'd kick me out. (I felt like one was trying to push me out.) Every time I worried, they assured me they'd never do such a thing; and one was angry I was accusing them of being untrustworthy. 

Recently, they said they‚Äôd be moving to a different apartment and I wasn't allowed to join them. After they told me, I had a panic attack. I told them to leave me alone and that we would discuss things when I was more emotionally regulated. They didn‚Äôt listen at first but eventually they gave me some space. 

Later, I was looking at apartments and I asked them about driving. For context, I don't have a driver's license or a car because I can't afford one. I assumed they would take me grocery shopping since they changed our agreement (I admit this was bad). They said it was my responsibility to do so and that I should've gotten a drivers license already. I agree, but my timeline was rapidly changed. My plan was to get a drivers license when I could afford a car.

I lashed out at them saying that they were terrible friends who didn't care about me. They said that I should look into Borderline because their therapist diagnosed me with it. (We‚Äôve never met.) They also said that me lashing out at them like this was a behavior pattern of mine and that my behavior was abusive.

Why won't I move back in with my parents? My father is emotionally, psychologically, verbally, and mentally abusive and this gave me CPTSD. 

They said I was abusive because I would threaten them to get them to get what I wanted. Ex: me telling them that I was thinking about moving back in with my abusive father.

They said that unless I apologized and changed my behavior/attitude immediately, they would end our friendship forever. And even then, it was no guarantee we could stay friends. Being alone is my worst fear and they know this. This sent me into an anxiety attack/depressive episode and I apologized about everything to not lose my friends. 

Details: We‚Äôve been having problems for a while. With one, I stopped bringing up issues because they would say I was insulting/accusing them. They would blame my PTSD for my behavior and I‚Äôd end up apologizing (with my initial problem never being addressed.) With the other, they won't tell me any of their problems. I tried to get them to tell me many times. The only problem I knew about was them not being emotionally available to help me with my CPTSD (which is valid). So if I had an anxiety attack, I would cry under my cover and into my pillow so they wouldn't feel like they had to help me.

96,1epfrgv,AITA for telling my nephew to wash his hands before touching my baby?,"I live in a multi-generational household where there are a lot of people so leanliness is something that I'm very particular with, especially with kids. Kids get other kids sick. I have a nephew who is interested in my baby. Ever since my baby was born, my nephew has always been wanting to touch his hands, face, arms and wants to hold him too. My nephew is 6 years old and very hyperactive. His parents don't really give a crap about what he does and spoils him rotten. I tell him to wash his hands before he touches the baby. This goes for everyone that wants to hold my baby.

One day, my mom tells me and my bf that she has to tell me something. She said that my SIL said that she feels hurt that I keep telling her kid to wash his hands every time he touches my baby. And I'm just like ""wtf"" Like I don't even yell at him to wash his hands. I talk to my nephew nicely to please wash his hands so we have clean hands before we touch the baby. And my mom goes ""He has a hard time washing his hands in the sink every time. You can just give him hand sanitizer."" And I told him ""That's the same thing as washing his hands. He can just pull the stool to wash his hands since he can't reach the sink like his cousins do."" (Like seriously this kid can't do anything himself.) This is a way for me to teach him about hygiene too. And my mom doesn't agree. She says to me that I have to do it or else your sister will not feel good about it and tell your brother and your brother will be upset and say something that I don't like. 

So again it goes back to my mom making sure my brother and SIL feels comfortable and not me and my bf. She always wants to make them feel welcome. And I said ""I want him to wash his hands if he wants to touch my baby."" And this whole time my mom is yelling at me while my nephew and my baby is in the same room. My baby wakes up and my nephew goes ""I wash my hands, mama"" and she goes to him and says ""I know darling, yes you do."" My bf goes ""There's clearly favoritism here and it's always been like that."" I tell my mom ""I'm not gonna do that. He either washes his hands or doesn't touch him."" And my mom goes ""You know it's also not good to hear when someone says to your kid to wash their hands."" Like I'm just a ""someone"" to this family. I told her that I don't want my kid to get sick. And she goes ""He also touches his cousin and doesn't need to wash his hand."" And I go ""But he's an older baby! He's literally 18 months and my baby is 2 months old! He can get sick easily especially since my nephew picks his nose and touches the floor and the dog!"" And she goes ""Fine then I'll just tell them what you said and hope she doesn't get upset.""

She doesn't have to tell her what I said omg that's how drama starts. I swear to God my mom LOVES drama. She said she doesn't want this family to fight.

99,1epe3jb,AITA for telling my dad that kicking me out of my room to let his friend live in it was wrong?,"I, (15F), have recently been kicked out of my own room by my dad so his friend and her son could live in it.

My dad informed me that they will be staying in my room for a week to rest and will be leaving afterwards which I agreed to since I had no choice. A day prior to his friend‚Äôs arrival, I procrastinated in cleaning my room and had told myself I will clean it during the night which angered my dad. This led to an argument which made me stay at a friend‚Äôs house for a week. 

When I got back home, I found my clothes and items stuffed in a trash bag down in our basement. I had also learned that Jane and her son will not be staying with us for a week but will be living in my room from now on. Our house only consists of 2 rooms so we do not have a guest/spare bedroom. (Note: my parents and two siblings sleep in the other room which is why I did not choose to even sleep there) 

My dad had months prior to Janes arrival to find a house with more space for us to move into but he chose to let Jane live in my room. My dad told me that I can either sleep in the living room/dining room which is also the common area where everyone in the house eats and watches television or the basement where it leaks everywhere and smells. 

It made me upset how my dad chose to give up my set of space and privacy for a friend he isn‚Äôt even that close to and only helped because they were friends years ago. His choice of giving up my privacy and own room is truly upsetting as he knows how important privacy is to teenagers.

100,1epe1en,AITA for visiting my surrendered cat at the shelter?,"My husband (33M) and I (31F) made the very difficult decision to return one of our cats, Eclair, to the shelter we adopted him from a couple months ago. We've had him since 2019 when he was a kitten, and he was always the problem child of our 6 cats. He'd been on Prozac for years, we have multiple feliways, but he began targeting one of the other cats, Mina, at the end of last year. He was relentlessly pursuing her, Mina hid in the kitchen cupboard all the time and stopped using the litter box, and I eventually found her with a deep puncture in her tail. We took both cats to the vet multiple times, tried different medications, but nothing was working. We tried rehoming him ourselves, but we ultimately figured he'd have better luck finding a new home at a shelter where he'd be posted online and whatnot. It's also a private shelter/sanctuary that's basically a house, and all the cats have free reign over several connected rooms and a big patio. So he's not just in a tiny kennel.

When we surrendered him, the staff member told us we could come visit him, volunteer, and generally be involved. We've been visiting Eclair on Saturdays for a few hours each week. I've also befriended a few other cats there. One of my favorites is a unique looking girl with a very sweet and affectionate personality, and the fact that she hasn't been adopted yet now makes me feel like they don't do nearly enough to get their cats adopted. They mostly post their dogs on Instagram on the rare chance they do post, the petfinder pages for most of the cats have a single blurry photo and no bio, the actual adoption portion of the website doesn't even work on mobile, and it just seems they need better online support in general.

It's always the same staff member every week, and she has told us that Eclair is happier and more affectionate after we visit. Today when we went to visit Eclair, the staff member told us the director doesn't want us visiting him anymore. She didn't say why, but I overheard her talking to a volunteer and the director said it's not fair to Eclair that we keep visiting and confusing him. Which I could understand if we hadn't been under the impression our visits were positive for him.

We are devastated we can't see him anymore because we do still love him. I also really looked forward to going to the shelter and seeing all the cats. We've visited 4-5 times now, and this just blindsided and really hurt us. I've worked with animals before, but I don't have experience with adoptable cats. Is it cruel that we kept going back to see him? I imagine there are actual volunteers that are only there once a week for a couple hours, so the cats are used to people coming and going.  They did take Eclair off his Prozac and it sounds like he's been inappropriately urinating, so I'm also wondering if they think our weekly visits are causing that.

101,1epdzte,WIBTA if I poured water in my mothers car seat?,"My(17f) mother and I usually get along  well but there's this one thing that has been really annoying me. She keeps leaving her water bottle on the passenger seat, where I always sit, and not closing it properly. This causes it to leak, and then my butt gets wet. It's okay in the summer heat, but when it's night and freezing it's really annoying. I have complained multiple times about this to her, and she keeps saying she won't do it next time. So, I feel like maybe the only way to get her to understand is if I do it to her. But other than that she is a good mom and she is raising me on her own, so it is an ethical dilemma for me. Help please!


UPDATE:
Hi, I would like to add some clarification to this post, when I posted it, it was 11 pm I was outside, and my pants were cold, so I probably wasn‚Äôt in the best mental state to be posting stuff on Reddit. Now I am dry and it is nearly the afternoon, so my head is a lot more clear.

I have mild-ish sensory issues for certain things ( it might be due to my ADHD( I am diagnosed btw), as I have heard that can be a symptom) and a big one is getting jeans/ socks wet, it really sets me off. Some comments called me a moody toddler( and rightfully so), that‚Äôs kind of how I feel when that happens. My mom has seen  me get very upset over wet jeans/ socks before ,  so I feel like she knows to a certain extent how I feel. 

Overall, other than moments like that, I am easygoing, respectful of my mom, get good grades and I listen to my mom.

 The whole wanting to get back at  her thing, was mainly due to how she usually is not sympathetic if I go through something, unless she herself has experienced that. For example, when I got a stye, she wasn‚Äôt rude, but she did tell me not to make a big deal of the pain. Only when she got it did she admit that it was horrible and she was sorry for not taking me seriously.

Also, although in this case it is a small thing, promising to change something and then not acting on it is something I hate. It‚Äôs one of the main reason both of us left my dad and aren‚Äôt really speaking to him anymore.

Now, with all the comments saying yta that is clearly out of the option, and I swear as much as I was considering it I doubt I would have the guts to go through with it. The main suggestions I have seen in the comments are bring a towel, sit her down and talk to her, or get her a new water bottle. I will try all three of those! In case of her water bottle it‚Äôs a giant flask that she takes with her whenever we go out, so maybe we should get her two smaller bottles that are also easier to close. 

I am now going to sit down and talk to her about how much this is bothering me and offer the solutions!!

Also, commentators who were nice with their feedback, thanks for being so sweet I know that post really didn‚Äôt deserve it, but you guys are so nice! Other commenters, I totally get it, I probably would have typed the same thing in your place.

Bye!! I can update if you guys want after!

So, I feel like maybe the only way to get her to understand is if I do it to her. But other than that she is a good mom and she is raising me on her own, so it is an ethical dilemma for me. Help please!


UPDATE:
Hi, I would like to add some clarification to this post, when I posted it, it was 11 pm I was outside, and my pants were cold, so I probably wasn‚Äôt in the best mental state to be posting stuff on Reddit. Now I am dry and it is nearly the afternoon, so my head is a lot more clear.

I have mild-ish sensory issues for certain things ( it might be due to my ADHD( I am diagnosed btw), as I have heard that can be a symptom) and a big one is getting jeans/ socks wet, it really sets me off. Some comments called me a moody toddler( and rightfully so), that‚Äôs kind of how I feel when that happens. My mom has seen  me get very upset over wet jeans/ socks before ,  so I feel like she knows to a certain extent how I feel. 

Overall, other than moments like that, I am easygoing, respectful of my mom, get good grades and I listen to my mom.

 The whole wanting to get back at  her thing, was mainly due to how she usually is not sympathetic if I go through something, unless she herself has experienced that. For example, when I got a stye, she wasn‚Äôt rude, but she did tell me not to make a big deal of the pain. Only when she got it did she admit that it was horrible and she was sorry for not taking me seriously.

Also, although in this case it is a small thing, promising to change something and then not acting on it is something I hate. It‚Äôs one of the main reason both of us left my dad and aren‚Äôt really speaking to him anymore.

Now, with all the comments saying yta that is clearly out of the option, and I swear as much as I was considering it I doubt I would have the guts to go through with it. The main suggestions I have seen in the comments are bring a towel, sit her down and talk to her, or get her a new water bottle. I will try all three of those! In case of her water bottle it‚Äôs a giant flask that she takes with her whenever we go out, so maybe we should get her two smaller bottles that are also easier to close. 

I am now going to sit down and talk to her about how much this is bothering me and offer the solutions!!

Also, commentators who were nice with their feedback, thanks for being so sweet I know that post really didn‚Äôt deserve it, but you guys are so nice! Other commenters, I totally get it, I probably would have typed the same thing in your place.

Bye!! I can update if you guys want after!

102,1epdzq2,AITA for not allowing my mother-in-law to stay with us for an indefinite period of time? ,"
I (32 American F) have been married to my husband (38 Caribbean M) for 7 years. We are on the same page about most things except for how long his mother can stay with us. Most of his family has moved to the US so when his mother, who is retired, comes to visit, she says she wants to stay for a month or two to spend time with family. There‚Äôs just one problem. She always buys a one way ticket and stays much longer than expected. For example, she came to visit in 2023 and planned to stay for 2 months but ended up staying for 11 months. When she does this, she usually has to spread her stay between several households. To be fair, during that time, she only spent a few weeks with us, primarily because I would consistently ask my husband how long she planned to stay. I know counting the days until her departure seems a bit harsh but our apartment is not that big, we have a small child who has to sleep in our bed because she takes his room when she stays and she stayed with her brother for 6 months after asking to stay only a month. My questioning has caused arguments between my husband and I because he says it comes off that I don‚Äôt want her around, which isn‚Äôt true. I like her I just didn‚Äôt want to fall victim to her coming and never leaving. According to him, the way their family works is if she comes into town, she can stay as long as she wants and no one is going to ask her to leave. He says me rushing her to leave makes him feel like he‚Äôs kicking his mother out and that makes him uncomfortable. He says that family is very important in Caribbean culture and Americans are just more selfish in their mindset and would question what I needed space for? I told him family is important to me as well but my family would never stay in someone‚Äôs space for an indefinite period of time without being transparent about what their plans were. I don‚Äôt care who you are, everyone likes their space and even if his family didn‚Äôt mind, staying 9 months longer than you planned to, in my opinion, is selfish and an egregious overstay of your welcome. In addition to that, she stays up until 3-4am watching tv, she‚Äôs cheap, doesn‚Äôt pay for her own food and never offers to cook or help out. It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs on vacation at everyone else‚Äôs expense. Our bills increase when she stays with us and since we are on a budget, we can‚Äôt always comfortably accommodate another adult, but feel compelled to do so because it‚Äôs his mother. She even got mail delivered to our place! My husband and I continued to be at odds about this and stopped talking to each other. He realized this was affecting our household and decided to drop her off with family again. He didn‚Äôt talk to me for a week after and she was upset as well. AITA for wanting my space?

103,1epdz7l,AITA for handing this misunderstanding the way I did?,"So, I (16f) and my best friend (also 16f) go to the gym together 3 times a week. Yesterday we agreed which days of the week we'll be going for this new week without discussing a time (we have usual days we go but had to change them this week because of shifts at work.)

Basically, this morning she called me at 8:20am and woke me up to tell me we should go at 9am sharp because her schedule for the day is packed with studying and she wants to get to it ASAP. She said it's not okay that I wanted to go at around 11am-12pm-ish because she woke up early especially for this and even though we didn't discuss a time I should have assumed it would be early.

I told her it's also not okay to expect me to be a mind reader and just know when she wants to go and is able to go workout, and I want to sleep a bit more cause I've been studying last night and went to bed late, and that is the reason I want to go later. I also told her that if she needs to go early to not mess up her schedule, it's okay, and she's welcome to go when she can, and I'll go later since of course that way we both get to fit everything we want to in our day and aren't depending on one another in a situation where we're both out of sync.

She started getting mad at me and saying that the time I wanted to go is really late, and she is willing to go at 10 if I want to go and it felt like she was guilt tripping me for not reading her mind but it's ""not okay"" that I want to go late (but I am exhausted and want to go at a time that fits me and want her to not stop herself from going when she finds is best for her schedule). She basically ignored the option I offered of each of us going alone when we are the most comfortable and able to go today so I repeated the idea.

She basically shrugged it off saying it's no fun therefore I should compromise with her and go at 10, but again, I can't, if it's about fun: I will not have fun when made to go to the gym exhausted, while she will enjoy herself and I'll be miserable.

I again said that I believe it's best if each goes at a time that's good for herself and next time we'll communicate the night before to avoid this kind of miscommunication but she just replied ""whatever"" and that's it.

108,1epdi22,AITAH for calling my friend a jerk during movie night,"Im in a friend group that gets along for the most part and hangs out a lot, but one girl specifically kind of hates me and I dont know why. Normally I just ignore her mean comments or laugh it off like she's joking (even though her serious and anrgy tone means that she's not). We have movie nights a lot in my friend group.

So something happened this time around that just made me lose it and I wondering if I went too far. We were finishing up a movie series we had been watching, everyone was talking through it because most of us had seen it before. The girl this is about had seen it plenty, I was one of the only 2 people who hadnt seen it and I was pretty lost. I ask a question and she gets mad, telling me I wouldve understood if I was paying attention even though everyone else was talking too.

I ignore it and another friend answers my question. It happens a few more times cus I cant hear great and its easy to miss stuff. I make a joke at one point, making fun of the movie for not explaining something, and she turns to me and says (in a really angry tone) 'if youd just shut up and watch the movie, youd understand'. I ask her why she's being such a jerk and 2 of my other friends turn to go 'no ones being a jerk, calm down' like she wasnt being mean to me in front of all of them.

I stay quiet for the rest of the movie but make fun of what I think is a kind of dumb scene towards the end (under my breath, not meaning for her to hear) and she turns to me and whispers, 'if you dont like it, then leave'.

Normally I just ignore her mean comments or laugh it off like she's joking (even though her serious and anrgy tone means that she's not). We have movie nights a lot in my friend group.

So something happened this time around that just made me lose it and I wondering if I went too far. We were finishing up a movie series we had been watching, everyone was talking through it because most of us had seen it before. The girl this is about had seen it plenty, I was one of the only 2 people who hadnt seen it and I was pretty lost. I ask a question and she gets mad, telling me I wouldve understood if I was paying attention even though everyone else was talking too.

I ignore it and another friend answers my question. It happens a few more times cus I cant hear great and its easy to miss stuff. I make a joke at one point, making fun of the movie for not explaining something, and she turns to me and says (in a really angry tone) 'if youd just shut up and watch the movie, youd understand'. I ask her why she's being such a jerk and 2 of my other friends turn to go 'no ones being a jerk, calm down' like she wasnt being mean to me in front of all of them.

I stay quiet for the rest of the movie but make fun of what I think is a kind of dumb scene towards the end (under my breath, not meaning for her to hear) and she turns to me and whispers, 'if you dont like it, then leave'. So I do, but while Im waiting for my ride, another person makes the same joke I did and she didnt say anything while everyone laughed at the joke.

Hello, I(17F)decided that I am not going to play volleyball for my senior year. This decision was made after I had two seasons (Sophomore and Junior year) that felt like hell. I thought about if I really wanted to not play anymore for almost 9 months now. Once people started realizing that I was not going to play, they started pressuring me to join. (Backstory : the last two seasons were so bad because I was constantly getting disrespected by the coach and other players. I also would be pulled from the game less than a minute in and would sit there for the rest of the game. Most of the time, my sub would be a freshmen that had no idea what they were doing. I was placed on JV for my junior year because they ‚Äúneeded a leader‚Äù, only for me to sit on the bench most of the season. I didn‚Äôt even get JV team captain, despite being the only junior on JV. Everytime I tried to learn what was causing me to play, my coach would tell me ‚Äúit just wasn‚Äôt the right time for you to be in‚Äù and ‚Äúyou are not what I want right now‚Äù.) (I would also like to include that during the games I played, I lead in passing, serving, assists, and spikes. So it‚Äôs not like I was terrible at the game)Back to now, my mother, let‚Äôs call her Kayla, has found out that I do not plan on playing my senior year. At first, she was just begging for me to play. I thought she would let it go once I said no, but it got worse. Everytime she asks and I tell her no, she guilt trips me with ‚ÄúI guess I will never see my baby play again‚Äù and your team will be so disappointed in you‚Äù and last with ‚ÄúYou are so pathetic for quitting on your coaches like that‚Äù. She also slams doors and stomps away when I won‚Äôt give up.She knows what I went through that last two seasons, and she was there for me after the games where all I did was sit on the bench. So far, she did ground me from my car and from seeing my boyfriend for two weeks a month ago. That was cut short once she realized I wouldn‚Äôt be able to take my brother to work. Then for a couple weeks straight, she could tell me she was disappointed in me, and that I could loose all my fatness if I just played volleyball.

His family passes down the dad's first or middle name to the first born son, which we did for our first along with using my dad's name for the middle name. Tears were shed figuring out our first‚Äôs name since my husband almost wasn't willing to include my dad's name who passed away several years ago. 

So today I broached the conversation of names with him for our next baby. I mentioned that I would ask least like my maiden name to be the middle name to which he responded that he didn't want us to be the ""crazy hyphenated family."" I immediately thought this response was stupid, especially considering 1) my maiden name is a common name for a boy and 2) we aren't hyphenating our last names, it would just be a middle name. 

I let him know that I didn‚Äôt like that response and was making my case for why it was lame of him (paraphrasing here). At one point, in an attempt to summarize what I was thinking I point out to him that he shot down my maiden name as a viable option because we would be the ""crazy hyphenated family"" and it came across as ""being kind of douchey"" to me. He immediately called me disrespectful for saying that and wanted to halt the conversation all together because he interprets that as me calling him a douche. This only annoyed me more because we have a pattern where anytime I am frustrated with him he has zero tolerance for it and it turns into a conversation all about how I don‚Äôt realize how I come across or I should have said it another way instead of addressing the issue I was bringing up in the first place. 

To be fair I do need to do better in how share what upsets me, and other times he really can't handle even the slightest sound of frustration in my voice without it being deemed ""disrespectful."" I digress, but he is now angry at me for later pointing out that both my dad (who would be close to 80 years old if he was still alive) and my brother both had their mom's maiden names as their middle name. So if my grandparents generation and my dads generation which are really the equivalent of his great-grandparents and grandparents generations could handle having their wives maiden names used as a middle name, and he can't... he's coming off as domineering or I can't even think of the right word to describe it (hence why I said douchey the first time we discussed it). I also said, ‚ÄúI didn't realize we were like that.‚Äù 

When I pointed that out, he told me that I was ""tearing him down"" and we couldn't continue the conversation like that.

I hate to be selfish but it is my wedding day overall. I truly hate to make others feel upset, but feel that for the first time in my life I can put myself before others FOR MY OWN WEDDING

2025 bride here! Finally have a wedding date and venue picked. I have had my bridesmaids listed in my head for many months before officially sending out bridesmaid boxes to ask in a cute way‚Ä¶ but my fiance‚Äôs sister is not one of them. 

If I could have all of the girls I wanted.. that would have been 11 bridesmaids. So, I decided to stick with my closest friends and college roommates. I moved 11 hours away from home to be with my fiance and could not imagine not having them on this adventure. 

Here is why I feel selfish.. my fiances younger brother proposed as well and they are already getting married before us (we have been engaged longer so I kind of feel like wtf). His fiance (who I never got along with) asked my fiance‚Äôs sister to be in her wedding as a bridesmaid. Come to find out that the sister is now upset with me. Her and I are not close.. after the 3 years of moving here and trying.. she is much closer to the other bride to be. I feel that the only reason she is THIS upset with me is because she was asked to be in one and not both. 

So that she felt more involved in our wedding day, I put together a beautiful box of gifts and asked her if she could do a reading during our ceremony (I mean seriously that is a HUGE honor in the catholic church). I even let her know that she will get ready with us day of for hair and makeup, and have her invited to my bachelorette. 

Considering that this is the only family I have out here, I feel that I have made a mistake. I am finding out she is mad at me because it is being talked about amongst the family. Which makes me even more angry because I dont want everyone talking about me behind my back. Its seriously ONE DAY!!!! OUR WEDDING DAY!!! and nothing but drama.

For context, earlier, my mother had called to ask if she could take some of my pink and red dirty clothes to complete her load for the washing machine. I told her yes and that was it.

‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not washing now and it‚Äôs all over my floor, now I‚ÄôM gonna have to put it all back into my hamper‚Äù

‚ÄúYou wanted them to finish the load‚Äù

‚ÄúDid I have to?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, but it‚Äôs not like I told you to wash them. You called me and asked if you could and I said yes, but I said nothing about washing them tomorrow or at any point‚Äù

‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre being entirely unreasonable‚Äù

‚ÄúHow? How exactly am I the unreasonable one? Because I don‚Äôt want clothes all over my floor when I‚Äôm coming back late at night?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know what? I didn‚Äôt think this would be such a huge issue and I think you‚Äôre forgetting that I didn‚Äôt have to do this for you. But don‚Äôt worry, I will NEVER touch a single article of clothing of yours AGAIN, I will never do a [good] intention for you again‚Äù

125,1epaybq,WIBTA if I asked my roommate to stop sticking her hair on the shower walls?,"I (f24) live with three roommates. Two of which are dating- they share the master bedroom and bathroom.
I share a bathroom with our 3rd roommate (f20).

Originally when she first moved in she was always gone- I‚Äôm talking day and night for six months. Her room was like a really expensive storage unit. I never asked her to help clean because she was never here. 

She eventually moved out . A few months later, that didn‚Äôt end up working and she broke up with her somewhat boyfriend and moved back in. She‚Äôs actually living here now, though we‚Äôre far from friends, we hardly see her come out of her room.

Now I have an issue with her not cleaning. She sticks her hair, purposefully, on the walls of the shower. It‚Äôs everywhere. All over the shower organizer, the shower walls, the tub and tub walls, the sink the toilet. I can‚Äôt escape her hair!! Maybe I‚Äôm super sensitive but it makes me gag. I‚Äôve snaked the drains twice since she‚Äôs moved back in and almost every two days it‚Äôs filling up with water again. She also drops shampoo or conditioner(not sure which) on the tub floor, tub walls and even the shower walls. It‚Äôs so gross and slimy every time I get in. 

I deep cleaned the shower and snaked the drain a week ago and after she showered it was right back to the gross slimy state. I clean the tub each time I shower so I don‚Äôt have to step on the gunk. It‚Äôs nice and clean for her EVERY TIME but disgusting when I get in.

I‚Äôve asked our other roommate to speak with her since they had her move back in but they refuse since its ‚Äúour shared space‚Äù.
I don‚Äôt need her to clean the entire bathroom, I‚Äôm fine with cleaning it regularly. I just cannot stand the hair and slime and gunk she mindlessly leaves.

I want to say something but I don‚Äôt want to hurt her feelings. I don‚Äôt think she has any medical issues as to why shes leaving so much hair around- she dies her hair with black box dye and it looks healthy- but again we don‚Äôt interact enough for me to know.

I (f24) live with three roommates. Two of which are dating- they share the master bedroom and bathroom.
I share a bathroom with our 3rd roommate (f20).

Originally when she first moved in she was always gone- I‚Äôm talking day and night for six months. Her room was like a really expensive storage unit. I never asked her to help clean because she was never here. 

She eventually moved out . A few months later, that didn‚Äôt end up working and she broke up with her somewhat boyfriend and moved back in. She‚Äôs actually living here now, though we‚Äôre far from friends, we hardly see her come out of her room.

Now I have an issue with her not cleaning. She sticks her hair, purposefully, on the walls of the shower. It‚Äôs everywhere. All over the shower organizer, the shower walls, the tub and tub walls, the sink the toilet. I can‚Äôt escape her hair!! Maybe I‚Äôm super sensitive but it makes me gag. I‚Äôve snaked the drains twice since she‚Äôs moved back in and almost every two days it‚Äôs filling up with water again. She also drops shampoo or conditioner(not sure which) on the tub floor, tub walls and even the shower walls. It‚Äôs so gross and slimy every time I get in. 

I deep cleaned the shower and snaked the drain a week ago and after she showered it was right back to the gross slimy state. I clean the tub each time I shower so I don‚Äôt have to step on the gunk. It‚Äôs nice and clean for her EVERY TIME but disgusting when I get in.

I‚Äôve asked our other roommate to speak with her since they had her move back in but they refuse since its ‚Äúour shared space‚Äù.
I don‚Äôt need her to clean the entire bathroom, I‚Äôm fine with cleaning it regularly. I just cannot stand the hair and slime and gunk she mindlessly leaves.

I want to say something but I don‚Äôt want to hurt her feelings. I don‚Äôt think she has any medical issues as to why shes leaving so much hair around- she dies her hair with black box dye and it looks healthy- but again we don‚Äôt interact enough for me to know.

Due to me being able to fulfill all my graduation requirements in the first semester, I have the opportunity to graduate early. I want to do it. Probably the biggest thing would be that I could get in more hours at my job, whatever that would be (trying to get one, but it‚Äôs not going great; I‚Äôll have one by then though, at the latest), so I can get more money to either save for a car and insurance or buy whatever else I want.  

My mom (53F,) however, wants me to graduate with the rest of my class, so I can participate in the big end-of-the-year ceremony. Now, me being in this ceremony, it‚Äôd mean a lot for her-even point blank said it‚Äôd break her heart if I didn‚Äôt. However, this ceremony means nothing to me.

To put it bluntly, I‚Äôm not all that attached to HS, and I wouldn‚Äôt hate leaving it all behind.

i told her that the registration has closed for the course that i was talking about.

she got angry for some reason and told me ""just so you know, you didn't tell me if i wanted to apply or not""

So I have a permanently deformed hand due to accidentally slashing it with a box cutter last year while opening a package. It ended up severing my flexor tendon leading to a year of physical therapy and now two operations. When the injury occured she maintained th stance that I was being a sook and needed to get over it.

I told her countless times that it hurt to do work and I could tell something was off but she didn't listen, that lead to my tendon retracting all the way up my carpel tunnel, and causing a complication in my surgery. I feel this is a mindset problem which MUST be reworked or it will cause damage again. 

Today I woke up with body shakes and gastro, which is mild in comparison but it was the same attitude and treatment. She even told me to man up and stop being a sook about it. 

Now I've told her I will no longer support HER when she's sick, as she has no sense of care for me in my situation.

So I told her that I just needed a few days and she said ""so it only took one mistake for you to get so angry at me. You know when you turned up pregnant and all of my dreams for you went up in smoke I didn't get angry at you.""

My dad has a lot of issues, alcoholism, anger issues, etc. So I am not defending him here, I know he messed up. But essentially he tried to get the friend, who had cancer, to live his share of the company to just him.

From what I understand, he was hoping to get my bf's dad out of the company. The opposite ended up happening when my bf's dad found out. He ended up buying him out of the company completely, and it has since been really successful.

They aren't very close because of this. But luckily my bf's family doesn't hold it against me.

But our family has struggled a lot. Our dad giving up the business was a big mistake because it ended up making a lot of money. He has a hard time keeping a job and has not worked since.

Since then, my sister still hasnt cleaned. I didnt even care since the floor was clean. When my uncle and other aunt visited, my sister finally started cleaning up because there was no room for everyone.

She and my cousin ended up putting her folded clothes on my bed and blocked the closet with a chair and threw everything else onto my side and into the closet.

So, my parents took me to my paternal grandparents‚Äô home where Lisa, unemployed at the time, was staying. Initially, there was nothing wrong between me and Lisa, but something changed.¬†

My aunt on my mom‚Äôs side, let‚Äôs call her Dee, lived in New York for the greater part of my life and would come visit around once every four months prior to moving here permanently in 2017. She lived near the American Girl Doll factory and store and decided to buy me one and send it to me. I loved that doll and carried her everywhere and that made Lisa jealous.

She gave it to me once she saw her car pull up, so when grandma came in, it was my word against Lisa‚Äôs.¬†

Fast forward to when I was around 9 years old. Lisa would take me and my god-sister to places like the movies, the aquarium, etc. One particular day, we went to the mall. My grandma had given me money to buy myself some small things and pay for my food if need be. Lisa called me and my god-sister to the food court for lunch. I got in line for Chick-fil-A, a few places behind Lisa, because I was going to pay for my food separately. Lisa called me up to her spot and paid for both mine and her food and made me pay her back. Me being somewhat smart, I didn‚Äôt understand why she‚Äôd make me give her $20 (all I had were twenties) for a $9 meal. I respectfully asked her this and she proceeded to yell and curse at me in the middle of the food court. She also body-shamed me because I chose to get a sandwich instead of nuggets‚Ä¶ it hurt at the time but now that I‚Äôm older, that makes zero sense. It may also be important to note that she was intoxicated here as well.

In 2019, days before Christmas, my mom got into a huge fight with my paternal grandparents and Lisa and ended up calling the police. Little 13-year-old me tried to break it up but Lisa, once again intoxicated, turned to me and said she‚Äôd beat me to a pulp after she‚Äôd beat my mom. I was shocked and just stood there staring at her with tears streaming. A few days later, my grandma spoke to me and told me that Lisa called her and was extremely upset with herself for what she said to me. But, Lisa never once apologized to my face, nor did she try to make up for it. On Christmas day, I went to my grandparent's home and eventually ran into Lisa. Given what my grandma had said, I thought that Lisa would be apologetic, but instead, she told my grandpa that I was ignoring her and rolling my eyes at her. I think it‚Äôs important to note that I hadn‚Äôt gotten the chance to say anything to her and I was in the middle of throwing something away when she came in. My dad told me to just ignore her behavior but it was kind of hard when my grandpa pulled me aside to lecture me about being the bigger person.

Fast forward to 2022, me and Lisa were kind of on good terms but we weren‚Äôt hanging out anymore. My grandparents wanted to fix that so when they found out that I wanted to go see one of my favorite rappers that was on tour at the time, they decided to ask Lisa to take me. She rejected me to my face and made fun of my music taste by saying this particular rapper was boring and that I should go see someone more entertaining. I responded to this by saying ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter because I wasn‚Äôt going to ask you to take me anyway. I‚Äôve already asked my cousin to take me.‚Äù After I said this, her attitude completely changed. She started listening to that particular rapper and trying to spark conversations with me about him. I ignored this and went to the concert without her.¬†

After the concert, my voice was completely gone due to me screaming. I stayed over at my grandparents‚Äô house after the concert was over. Lisa came over for God knows why and she asked how the concert was. I told her I had fun and I really enjoyed hanging out with my cousin. She got defensive and accused me of favoring my cousin over her. I denied it, though she did treat me better than Lisa did. She kept yelling at me, saying I was hateful like my mom and eventually punched me in the face. I wasn‚Äôt bruised but I was stunned. I mentioned it to my grandma and she said that she didn‚Äôt see it so she won‚Äôt say anything. After that, I kept as much distance from Lisa as I could.

A few months later at Thanksgiving, I saw Lisa again. My grandma had made me a cheesecake to share with my brothers and Lisa wanted some. I refused her some of mine and offered her the one that was exactly the same from the kitchen. My grandma agreed with me and Lisa jokingly threw something at her. I jokingly said, ‚ÄúBe careful, you know she likes hitting people.‚Äù Lisa stopped laughing and immediately got defensive and started calling me every name under the sun. I repeatedly said that I was joking but it was true. Lisa started getting more and more hostile and my grandpa eventually removed her from the house. Once again, and you might be noticing a pattern, Lisa was intoxicated. None of us spoke to her for weeks after that, but of course, my grandma caved and called her one day. Lisa gave an apology to only my grandparents and admitted her alcohol addiction. She began therapy (note that she called me crazy and unstable when she found out I was in therapy) and from what I hear, she‚Äôs trying to turn over a new leaf.¬†

Here‚Äôs where I may be the bad guy somehow. I have forgiven her, as I am a Christian and we are told by God to forgive. However, I have not forgotten anything she has done to me or said to me. I have not spoken to her since 2022 and I am perfectly fine with never speaking to her again. My dad and my grandparents say that I need to get over all of this and go back to how things were but I don‚Äôt think I can. Going back to how things were means that I would have to take that kind of abuse all over again and I can‚Äôt make myself go through that. I have decided that because she hasn‚Äôt been a part of my life from the beginning of sophomore year to now, I don‚Äôt want to invite her to my graduation or my graduation party. My dad says I shouldn‚Äôt exclude her and I haven‚Äôt even spoken to my grandparents about it because I know they‚Äôll say I‚Äôm wrong.

In 2019, days before Christmas, my mom got into a huge fight with my paternal grandparents and Lisa and ended up calling the police. Little 13-year-old me tried to break it up but Lisa, once again intoxicated, turned to me and said she‚Äôd beat me to a pulp after she‚Äôd beat my mom. I was shocked and just stood there staring at her with tears streaming. A few days later, my grandma spoke to me and told me that Lisa called her and was extremely upset with herself for what she said to me. But, Lisa never once apologized to my face, nor did she try to make up for it. On Christmas day, I went to my grandparent's home and eventually ran into Lisa. Given what my grandma had said, I thought that Lisa would be apologetic, but instead, she told my grandpa that I was ignoring her and rolling my eyes at her. I think it‚Äôs important to note that I hadn‚Äôt gotten the chance to say anything to her and I was in the middle of throwing something away when she came in. My dad told me to just ignore her behavior but it was kind of hard when my grandpa pulled me aside to lecture me about being the bigger person.

Fast forward to 2022, me and Lisa were kind of on good terms but we weren‚Äôt hanging out anymore. My grandparents wanted to fix that so when they found out that I wanted to go see one of my favorite rappers that was on tour at the time, they decided to ask Lisa to take me. She rejected me to my face and made fun of my music taste by saying this particular rapper was boring and that I should go see someone more entertaining. I responded to this by saying ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter because I wasn‚Äôt going to ask you to take me anyway. I‚Äôve already asked my cousin to take me.‚Äù After I said this, her attitude completely changed. She started listening to that particular rapper and trying to spark conversations with me about him. I ignored this and went to the concert without her.¬†

After the concert, my voice was completely gone due to me screaming. I stayed over at my grandparents‚Äô house after the concert was over. Lisa came over for God knows why and she asked how the concert was. I told her I had fun and I really enjoyed hanging out with my cousin. She got defensive and accused me of favoring my cousin over her. I denied it, though she did treat me better than Lisa did. She kept yelling at me, saying I was hateful like my mom and eventually punched me in the face. I wasn‚Äôt bruised but I was stunned. I mentioned it to my grandma and she said that she didn‚Äôt see it so she won‚Äôt say anything. After that, I kept as much distance from Lisa as I could.

A few months later at Thanksgiving, I saw Lisa again. My grandma had made me a cheesecake to share with my brothers and Lisa wanted some. I refused her some of mine and offered her the one that was exactly the same from the kitchen. My grandma agreed with me and Lisa jokingly threw something at her. I jokingly said, ‚ÄúBe careful, you know she likes hitting people.‚Äù Lisa stopped laughing and immediately got defensive and started calling me every name under the sun. I repeatedly said that I was joking but it was true. Lisa started getting more and more hostile and my grandpa eventually removed her from the house. Once again, and you might be noticing a pattern, Lisa was intoxicated. None of us spoke to her for weeks after that, but of course, my grandma caved and called her one day. Lisa gave an apology to only my grandparents and admitted her alcohol addiction. She began therapy (note that she called me crazy and unstable when she found out I was in therapy) and from what I hear, she‚Äôs trying to turn over a new leaf.¬†

Here‚Äôs where I may be the bad guy somehow. I have forgiven her, as I am a Christian and we are told by God to forgive. However, I have not forgotten anything she has done to me or said to me. I have not spoken to her since 2022 and I am perfectly fine with never speaking to her again. My dad and my grandparents say that I need to get over all of this and go back to how things were but I don‚Äôt think I can. Going back to how things were means that I would have to take that kind of abuse all over again and I can‚Äôt make myself go through that. I have decided that because she hasn‚Äôt been a part of my life from the beginning of sophomore year to now, I don‚Äôt want to invite her to my graduation or my graduation party. My dad says I shouldn‚Äôt exclude her and I haven‚Äôt even spoken to my grandparents about it because I know they‚Äôll say I‚Äôm wrong. My mom is completely on my side and will support me in whatever I decide. So, Reddit, AITA?

143,1ep9492,WIBTA? Pretty complicated situation affair ,"I am 44f, married today for 18 years, together 21. My husband is great and supports our family well (13f and 19m kids) but has never really supported me in the day to day life of a family. 

He was raised as the baby and his mom coddled him to the point that I can‚Äôt give enough kind feedback that I need help. His answer is that if I need help to ask. He won‚Äôt do it on his own, which is what his dad did. 

Over the years, we‚Äôve had issues but tried to work them out. Our sex life is random, vanilla and just not anything aimed to make me gain pleasure. He gets off, rolls over and goes to sleep. Early on he told me he loves getting oral but thinks it‚Äôs gross to do on a woman. 

Recently I have met a woman that is just great for me in every way. She‚Äôs married as well, but has cheated on her husband with at least 3 people in 7 years. We met, she told me she was questioning her marriage because I made her so happy and we left the meet with intent in meeting in 2 weeks. 

The meet in 2 weeks included another one of her previous affair partners and I became the 3rd wheel almost immediately. Since then the relationship has broken down and she has withdrawn all of the care she had told me she had and ‚Äúhopes to be friends‚Äù again. 

I know I‚Äôm the worst person possible by even engaging in this, but while I have no issue coming clean with my husband and dealing with the fallout she does. I hate to say it, but I still care for her deeply and would never harm her but I‚Äôm concerned she‚Äôs saving conversations and possibly have filmed us when we met.

Her husband is linked to me professionally and is the nicest guy. While I cheated, she‚Äôs been doing it for their entire marriage and it is hurting a lot of people. His previous marriage was the same exact thing- his first cheated many times and was caught. 

I know AITH but would it be the same if I came clean with him anonymously? Not specifics, just to let him know she has secret phones with passcodes and Face ID to hide her videos and pics she sends to potential affair partners. A simple ask for access to her phone would show him everything. I don‚Äôt want to ruin their marriage but he (and shit, I) deserve better.

144,1ep92tq,AITA for refusing to spend the night at my girlfriends house before her job interview ,"My (M20) girlfriend (F21) and I have been dating for about 10 months. A couple of times the first month she stayed over the weekend at my college apartment (we go to different schools), she started to stay at my real house some weekends after a couple months (sometimes I would go to hers). Overtime it would be balanced and mutual, but I would also sometimes go to her place on Thursdays because I was really bored at college. 

Overtime she started to not go to my house because she for whatever reason didn‚Äôt like how my parents (mom) acted there and I would mostly only go to her place. This continued even more once summer break started (though she graduated). I thought that it was fair since she was the only one who could drive at the time and she was driving me, but once I started driving nothing really changed. I brought this up one day especially because it wasn‚Äôt like I was doing much there anyways (maybe doing it by leaving abruptly wasn‚Äôt the best way to do it) and she ended up saying I didn‚Äôt have to always stay even though she has a *couple* times said I was ditching her when I went back home.

After I went a little less than before and for a month we both binged a 6 season show together which we both enjoyed. She would also equally go to my place, but this week we finished the show and I realized I stayed at her place for 4 days out of the week. This was tiring + I also had to stay home for three nights of this weekend to watch my dog who has separation anxiety and today said I could only go to her place if I brought my dog which she said okay to. Last night though my dog kept barking in the middle of the night and my girlfriend was mad about how the dog was there and waking up her parent, then went off about how I bring her everywhere which feeds into her anxiety, 9 hours isn‚Äôt a long time for a dog to stay alone, and I‚Äôm not doing anything about it. So I said that I didn‚Äôt need to spend the night because we weren‚Äôt doing anything (I didn‚Äôt say this but it‚Äôs also annoying having to be quiet and stay in the room and not turn on the bathroom lights with an automatic vent just cause her parents are sleeping. She then said it was the ""principle"" about bringing the dog that mattered.

Today when I woke up she asked if I could go with her to her job interview on either Monday Tuesday or Wednesday (because she doesn‚Äôt drive alone far/to unfamiliar areas) and I was busy on Tuesday I agreed on Monday assuming my dog was alone for just a few hours. But she then said I had to spend the night over cause we had to leave by 12. I said I wouldn‚Äôt because I can just come to her in the morning but she said that I'm gonna oversleep and be late (which my friends say too) so I would ruin the one thing she asks of me. 

I still think I would actually be on time if it‚Äôs something actually important, so am I the asshole for not wanting to spend the night over at my girlfriend‚Äôs place?

148,1ep80wf,WIBTA if I don't give my late bf's house to his parents?,"My BF \[30M, RIP\] and I \[33M\] were together for 15yrs. I was his Senior in Highsc, and we stayed together until a few months ago when he passed away due bone cancer.

I live in a traditional country where same sex marriage is no legal but is not a big issue socially. His parents kicked him out when he came out as gay at 17, my family took him in, helped him to finish HS and were supportive the most they could.

I work in HR and he worked in IT, since he started to work he made good money. He saved enough to purchase a house 10yrs ago, he was paying the mortgage all by himself. 4yrs ago he got the diagnosis. He reduced his working hours to take care of his health and I stepped in to pay the mortgage.

It was a hard battle, but cancer took him back in March. After he passed away, his family appeared in the picture, saying how they regretted not being in his son's life and stuff. Time went by and a month ago they reached out to me asking me when they can expect I could give them the keys of the house. Since same-sex marriage is no legal, they ""could"" claim the house as their family.

I told them that the house was in my name, I ""bought"" it from him a year into the cancer, so it was legally mine and I had been paying the mortgage way before it. They got upset and said I was being unreasonable, that it should be legally theirs, that my **BF would have wanted to give them the house**, which is in fact true, my bf talked a lot how he would give everything to them if that would fix the relationship between them. Actually, he bought the house as a way to bring them live with him so they would no longer rent; he also tried to make amends with them all this time, unsuccessfully.

I told them that I would give them the house for the price I bought it from my BF and they would have to pay me back these 4 years of mortgage + take the debt over their name. They said they didn't have the money and that it was so selfish of me to tell them that, knowing what my BF would have wanted. They proposed just to change the debt onto their name and give me no money in return, I declined. They got mad and the discussion got heated to the point they told me they would bring me to court accusing me of scamming my BF to have the house (they can‚Äôt).

They have been calling and texting me non-stop for the past month, telling me I would be an asshole to my bf if I don't give them the house. I know they can't pay me back all the money I put in the house, but I'm conflicted right now. Some friends told me that I should give them the house and move on with my life, but it just doesn't feel right to me. I'm leaning more onto not giving them the house, but I know my BF would jump the bed and give it to them. Right now their words feels empty and as if they just want to take advantage of the situation. I don't need the house, to be honest, but don't want to give them either.

We never talked with my bf what should I do with the house after his death, so WIBTA if I don't give them the house?

ETA: Thank you, thank you all for your kind words. I cried a lot with most of the comments. Sorry If I can't keep the pace and reply to everyone, just wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my heart.

ETA2: This blown up in ways I didn't even think about. Thank you all for your kind words. Just to add some info that looks like is needed for some of you: I live in a country in Central America, for safety reason will not give the name. Here is not illegal being LGBTQ+, but same sex marriage is just not legal, nothing more. We didn't live in the house, we lived at my apartment, that's why I don't need the house, but I just don't feel right to giving it to his parents. Also, almost all his money went to pay medical bills, he didn't want me to put my money on it (which obviously I would have) and buying the house was the best idea we came out with to satisfy the both of us. The house is not a big one (6mts x 10mts) and also is in the suburbs, is not worth the same as in other countries, around USD$90k or a little more.

He was such a kind heart, so I'm pretty sure that even if it was a lie, he would have given them the house the moment they acknowledge him as gay and tell him they loved him. That's the reason why I'm having a hard time considering this. I can't answer all your comments, but I'm trying to read you all. Thank you for your support.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-11,"WIBTA if I don't give my late bf's house to his parents? My BF \[30M, RIP\] and I \[33M\] were together for 15yrs. I was his Senior in Highsc, and we stayed together until a few months ago when he passed away due bone cancer.

I live in a traditional country where same sex marriage is no legal but is not a big issue socially. His parents kicked him out when he came out as gay at 17, my family took him in, helped him to finish HS and were supportive the most they could.

I work in HR and he worked in IT, since he started to work he made good money. He saved enough to purchase a house 10yrs ago, he was paying the mortgage all by himself. 4yrs ago he got the diagnosis. He reduced his working hours to take care of his health and I stepped in to pay the mortgage.

It was a hard battle, but cancer took him back in March. After he passed away, his family appeared in the picture, saying how they regretted not being in his son's life and stuff. Time went by and a month ago they reached out to me asking me when they can expect I could give them the keys of the house. Since same-sex marriage is no legal, they ""could"" claim the house as their family.

I told them that the house was in my name, I ""bought"" it from him a year into the cancer, so it was legally mine and I had been paying the mortgage way before it. They got upset and said I was being unreasonable, that it should be legally theirs, that my **BF would have wanted to give them the house**, which is in fact true, my bf talked a lot how he would give everything to them if that would fix the relationship between them. Actually, he bought the house as a way to bring them live with him so they would no longer rent; he also tried to make amends with them all this time, unsuccessfully.

I told them that I would give them the house for the price I bought it from my BF and they would have to pay me back these 4 years of mortgage + take the debt over their name. They said they didn't have the money and that it was so selfish of me to tell them that, knowing what my BF would have wanted. They proposed just to change the debt onto their name and give me no money in return, I declined. They got mad and the discussion got heated to the point they told me they would bring me to court accusing me of scamming my BF to have the house (they can‚Äôt).

They have been calling and texting me non-stop for the past month, telling me I would be an asshole to my bf if I don't give them the house. I know they can't pay me back all the money I put in the house, but I'm conflicted right now.

149,1ep7kfz,AITA for telling my friend it‚Äôs her fault she‚Äôs broke,"I (23F) have been best friends with my friend Samantha (23F) since high school. We both completed our undergrad and have degrees. while, I went on to complete my masters. She stayed home. For the last three years she's lived with her parents hasn't paid any bills, except her car and phone bill. She never used her undergrad degree in. She refuses to get a 9-to-5. She's been fired from two jobs in the last couple months and relies on YouTube (which she does not make any monetary gain from yet) and doing nails for income. However, she constantly complains to me that she has no money and can't do the things she wants because she can't afford. After she couldn't spend $300 fora girls trip. It lead to an argument, started by her. And I told her she needs to get a job and that she's irresponsible and that's why she has no money.  Now she's more mad at me and says she doesn't have any issues with money and I need to mind my business. 

I am pretty successful and I'm able to travel and buy all the things I want because I work really hard even while in school. My masters degree is for a good profession that will make me a decent amount of money. I don't wanna be stuck with friends who are unambitious when I am on this path. Am I the asshole for telling her she has no money and she needs to work harder ? I'm just trying to be a good friend because she hangs out with a lot of people who also don't have jobs which makes her think it's OK

Edit: it's not about how much money she has more so her work ethic, upset about her situation but not taking sustainable steps to change it. I only bring up my own job/school because I work really hard for the lifestyle I want. She says she wants the same lifestyle but doesn't do what's required.
