0,1eqt5tu,AITA for cursing out my dad on father's day,"
Hi, english is not my first language so sorry if it's a little weird.

I'm gonna start this with a context of my life, my (19f) parents never had that great of a relationship and divorced when I was  12 years old. My father (52M) was kinda abusive l heavily affected the way me and my sister (15f) view of him, for example,he used to have a horrific temper and would lash out at us because of the most mundane things.He was never good at finances, so when the divorce happened, my mother become the sole provider for our family, he never  payed properly child support or for our basic needs, just came with little gifts and ""helped out"" Here and then. 
This brings us to the issue: I used to do therapy a few years ago because of my severe depression and anxiety that my mom payed for struggling, but when I completed 18 years old she said she couldn't keep it up bc of the bills and asked my father to get the responsibility to pay until I could  pay myself. He say he would, but long story short, he didn't, delayed a lot of payments and I decided to get out of therapy to stop being embarrassed, what he didn't told me, was that he delayed 3 payments that amounted to something like $81 and then my ex therapist came to me asking for it. I'm a student who receives a tiny benefit to cover my basic living and I was caught by surprise with this, called him asking for a explanation and he said he couldn't pay (he says that a lot), so I asked my mom for help and together we payed half of the debt, he say he got the other part covered...he didn't, because the therapist called again saying she didn't receive the rest of the money. 
I payed from my own pocket, and said to my father ""I'm not mad, I'm disappointed because you didn't tell me, if you has told me you couldn't pay I would do my things and payed for it, but you didn't tell me and now it's my name who's being humiliated"", he answered that the world doesn't move around me and things would not always go as I want to, I just got tired and stopped talking to him. In the course of the next weeks he tried to chat with me like nothing happened   but I didn't get it much attention, until father's day, I had already made up my mind that I wouldn't go to his house to celebrate, he called my sister and she said we wouldn't go  (he messed up with her too, another story) and he hung up on her and then texted me ""Thanks daughter, for not coming"". I saw red. Then I unleash what was years of anger carefully tucked under false composure and emphaty, I said  that I am a adult now and I'm not going to screw myself up in order to get him comfortable and mind free. He tried to send  audios but I said I wouldn't listen and blocked my phone. My mom  said I was too harsh with him and that I was getting revenge by doing this to him during father's day, that I should've at least warn him that I wasn't going there because it's ""expected"" for me to go. I am just so mad and sad and I need to know if I'm really wrong. So, aita?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-12,"AITA for cursing out my dad on father's day

1,1eqt1jb,AITA For calling out my best friends bad behaviour? ,"I'm (F25) and my best friend is (F24). Her dad recently passed away which was the only family she had, I treated her like she was family and so did my extended family. When he passed away I started a GoFundMe for her and did everything I could to support her. 

Months later she asked to do a celebration of life at my house which I agreed to do. I invited people, bought food and so did everyone else, took time to set it up and she ended up not showing. I text her why she was so late which she didn't respond until she was two hours late to which I found out she was at a guys house she only knew for a few months. She was blaming it on him saying she didn't want to anger him or annoy him with reminding him about the gathering. He lives over an hour away from my place so she would have been four hours late, around the time everyone was leaving so I told her not to come to the house. I told her how hurt I was and left it at that because she stopped messaging me. 

We talked about what happened and her reasoning was she was afraid of getting him angry because they already had a fight that morning. She was sorry and saying she acknowledged that she should have done things differently. I said to her you're telling me you rather your friends and family be upset with you over a guy you just met. She said she wanted to balance it and not have anyone be angry with her. The last message she sent me she went off saying I'm like her ex because I didn't answer her right away and that she was begging for forgiveness from the start and that she was remorseful.

3,1eqsld6,WIBTA for inviting my father to my graduation over my mother,"I am graduating with a Second Class Second Division in Physics this winter, much to my disappointment. My mother's constant interference during my final year caused this outcome.

Background: My parents separated before my final year due to ongoing arguments. My mother is extremely religious, almost cult-like, while my father is agnostic. The separation happened before the summer, and I was aiming for at least a 2.1. However, my mother wasted my evenings, emotionally manipulating me into prayer groups, causing my grades to drop from \~67-70% to just above 50%. My father couldn’t help as he was living with his mother.

My winter exams were right after Christmas, and I tried to avoid going home, but my mother insisted. I was panicking to pass these exams due to the time she wasted. Most of my classmates were grateful for my predictions, but my revision plan fell apart, and I ended up scraping by. My grandmother tried talking to my mother, which helped a bit, but it was too late as summer exams were around the corner. Unlike the winter exams, summer exams covered the whole year, making me anxious about my performance. I attended every lecture, but my mother kept dragging me home early for prayers, wasting my time.

My father eventually got his own apartment and let me use his office. He apologized for everything, and I forgave him, as some of my siblings had tried to ""run away"" before the separation.

While I did get a 2.2, it cost me three master’s programs, two PhD opportunities, five post-docs, and over seven job offers. I had experience through internships, including work with a Medical Devices research group abroad. I was motivated to study smarter, but my mother’s interference held me back. Since getting the 2.2, I’ve faced rejection after rejection. My mother, however, continues to tell me that ""she prayed for me to get these results,"" which sickens me. I was awarded for my work placement efforts and invited my father, not my mother, to the ceremony as I was frustrated with how she treated me.

I received an offer for an MSc in Medical Physics, but it wasn’t at the college where my professors wrote recommendations, making me feel like I let them down. I plan to invite only my father to my graduation, as I’m still upset with my mother for wasting my study time and costing me potential opportunities. My father went through a lot to get my grant approved and supported me through my limbo phase after the results. I don’t think my mother deserves to see me graduate, as she’ll believe her prayers helped, oblivious to the cost of her actions.

The first time she watched him she didn't listen about putting the milk away and it got ruined, the second time we told her to give him his medicine at a certain time and she didn't.

She had been making little mistakes like this but this last time was just to much. She never does what we tell her. We picked them up from her church. While in the car I she decided to feed him a bottle of formula that had gone bad already and when we gave her the milk my wife was pumping in the car she wasn't careful putting it away and it all spilled. My wife doesn't produce much so every drop matters to us.

I had had enough and I called her and told her about everything. I was sure to be very respectful and not to raise my voice even my wife said she was proud of me for that. But she started sobbing and telling me how I'm her son and she doesn't need to listen to me and that I called her a bad grandma and how much I hurt her with everything I said.

It's similar to choosing a major in college, but just a bit less specific.

Now, I volunteer at an after-school programs, where I help middle school kids with their homework and recently an eighth graders, let's call her Sarah, came to me asking about how the environment of my school is for neurodivergent people 
(I’m autistic and she’s ADHD, so not exactly the same, but we live in a small place so I was the one with the most similar experience in the matter)

I immediately started explained to her that the environment is absolute trash, the only real accomodations I absolutely need, so the ones that i formally asked the school to implement for me are:
-The possibility of exiting the classroom and going to the bathroom without asking for permission in case of need.
-And the exclusion from group projects.
And still I had to wait almost five months for those to be approved; I often get singled out for simply being autistic and I'm always met with anger and annoyance when I ask for the class to understand that I have problems controlling my voice.

This is not an experience only I had as another girl that went to the same school had to transfer as attending the school was becoming to seriously affect her, since people were bullying her every day for having BPD and being partially deaf.

Sarah listened, thanked me and confessed that she was already unsure about going here, since she was not even sure she really liked the type of school and this was the nail in the coffin.

I genuinely thought that was it, but then when I went to school the day after the conversation a girl from my class 
(Lisa, 19F) started screaming at me for telling stupid, petty lies to Sarah, that it is my fault everyone hated me in the school and that my accommodations are simply ridiculous
(I'm not sure how she knows about what I said, but other people volunteer at the same program, so maybe someone heard and told her)

I didn't engage, as I'm not confrontational and simply skipped school for the day, went to my best friend’s school and waited for her to finish, then spent the rest of the day with her.

I've been avoiding Lisa ever since (summer helped) but then, yesterday, some documents about the new students enrolled in our school for the year came out and Sarah was not among them.

Lisa once again freaked out and started sending me mean messages about the situation, telling me that I ruined this girl's chances of attending a good school just because I can’t get over grudges.

Now I feel like maybe I should not have said things so bluntly to Sarah, like I should have sugar coated it a little more and maybe I robbed her of experiencing something she may have actually liked.

Before me and my girlfriend were together me and my friend were pretty close. We hung out quite a bit, she helped me get a job at her company and I’ve always looked up to her as a sort of mentor. She is very sable and successful. We have never been romantic.

We girlfriend met her once when we first started dating and got extremely insecure about our relationship. When we went out she felt I showed my friend more attention. She pretty much told me I had to cut my friend off and I did. I stopped saying yes to hanging out, didn’t text as frequently. She kinda took the hint and got upset and said she didn’t want me as a part of her life at all if I wasn’t allowed to hang out with her.

Now the thing is we work together and sit by eachother so we still had to interact a bit. At one point my girlfriend and I broke up and we got close again. Not ever hanging out outside of work or even getting lunch but having conversations and shed give me advice on things I needed help with.

Recently I got in a really bad accident that caused a lot of money problems for me. Honestly I was embarrassed to ask my family for help and my girlfriend is just finishing college so I know she doesn’t have the type of money I needed. 

I knew my friend would lend me the money no questions asked and not judge me at all so I went to her and I was write she sent the money and we didn’t even talk about the reason.

Well my girlfriend noticed the transactions through Venmo history and blew up. Saying that I was inappropriate and me and my friend have feeling for eachother. She then went through my friend and Is text history and found a message from a year ago where I told my friend that even though we are so distant and not really friends anymore I feel the universe connected us in this weird way. She said I’m an AH and have feeling for my friend. I don’t and I didn’t tell her because I knew she’s blow up about it.

I’ve done everything she asked and pretty much made the relationship with my friend nonexistent. I hadn’t even texted her in over a year before asking for the money. So AITA?

She pretty much told me I had to cut my friend off and I did. I stopped saying yes to hanging out, didn’t text as frequently. She kinda took the hint and got upset and said she didn’t want me as a part of her life at all if I wasn’t allowed to hang out with her.

Now the thing is we work together and sit by eachother so we still had to interact a bit. At one point my girlfriend and I broke up and we got close again. Not ever hanging out outside of work or even getting lunch but having conversations and shed give me advice on things I needed help with.

Recently I got in a really bad accident that caused a lot of money problems for me. Honestly I was embarrassed to ask my family for help and my girlfriend is just finishing college so I know she doesn’t have the type of money I needed. 

I knew my friend would lend me the money no questions asked and not judge me at all so I went to her and I was write she sent the money and we didn’t even talk about the reason.

Well my girlfriend noticed the transactions through Venmo history and blew up. Saying that I was inappropriate and me and my friend have feeling for eachother. She then went through my friend and Is text history and found a message from a year ago where I told my friend that even though we are so distant and not really friends anymore I feel the universe connected us in this weird way. She said I’m an AH and have feeling for my friend. I don’t and I didn’t tell her because I knew she’s blow up about it.

I’ve done everything she asked and pretty much made the relationship with my friend nonexistent. I hadn’t even texted her in over a year before asking for the money. So AITA? ",2.0,1.0589141,1,0
9,1eqqr37,AITA for not allowing my daughter to take her dog with her after not caring for about him for years?,"So about 10 years ago, I got my daughter a dog from one of my friends who just had a litter. To be honest, the dog (Milo) was to help our relationship after the divorce and it pretty much worked since the more time she spent at my place the closer we got back to how we were before. Four years ago she moved for college and the periods of times between visits became longer and longer till they pretty much stopped over the past year and a half. Yes she does come by but it's always a pop in and leave to go on a trip with her friends. To preface, yes our relationship (at least before this) is perfectly fine and we see each other regularly, I just was the one doing the travelling.   
  
During this time my younger son with my gf has grown increasingly attached with Milo. He's assumed full responsibility for Milo in the house and takes care of him without prompt. Most nights the dog sleeps in his bed/room. At first I made it clear that Milo was not his but his sisters and he was fine with that. Never gave us problems when his sister was around and hogged the dog. However with his sisters scarcity and lack of interest in the dog over the past year, I let him the lines get a blurred. Anywho, my daughter was over this past weekend and my son's friends came over asking if he and Milo could come play with them, referring to Milo as his dog. She cut me off while I was agreeing to say that Milo wasn't his dog but hers so he \[Milo\] wasn't going anywhere. I tried reasoning with her but she refused to listen. That was Friday afternoon. Sunday she's preparing to leave and she tells me that next time I come up I should bring Milo. I said sure and she clarified that it wasn't for a visit but for the dog to stay with her full time. That's when things got a bit difficult. I explained to her that brother was now attached to the dog and taking Milo would completely destroy him. Besides, Milo is entering his golden ages and such a change in environment can't be good for him either. She got upset and said it was her dog and she can do whatever she wants with him and we left things mostly unresolved.

He was basically the stereotypical ""offensive = funny"" teenager. We've dealt with his behaviour and have helped him work on himself over the time we've known him. He's made good progress and is doing much better currently.

I have this other friend (I'll call him D from now on) who I only briefly knew. I assumed that he was a nice, but something about him felt off, especially since he's 22. I bonded with him and sent him a invite to our discord. At the time before D joined, R was still having behavioural issues. We were going through a rough patch with him and were trying to deal with his issues. We wanted to approach the situation in the best possible way, and a lot of us have social anxiety disorder, which makes confrontation extremely difficult.

As soon as D joined, we started having problems. We privately mentioned the issues we were having with R to D, especially in regards to his username, which coupled with his behaviour had bad implications. When we told D, he pinged everyone and started to harass R to change his name. A fight broke out, D started saying unhinged things while R started using slurs and saying awful things.

13,1eqq4y5,AITA in this situation?,"My partner (28) and I (f25) have been together for 4 years. My partner struggles with intense anger issues and I try to support them the best I can with self regulation tools and by encouraging them to seek professional help.

A few weeks ago, they got into a very intense altercation that turned physical. It left me very traumatized because I never thought they had it in them to do something like this, which to me, feels so prehistoric... Some friends also witnessed the altercation and were equally scared. We all voiced our feelings and my partner apologized. 

We talked about it some more later on when we were back home, just the two of us. I once again voiced how uneasy the whole thing made me feel. As a social worker, I always try to see things through the other person's eyes (their childhood, understanding where all the anger stems from...) so instead of hammering the nail, I asked how I could help them regulate their anger next time a similar situation was to take place. They told me to physically stop them before it gets to a physical altercation. (they specified physically because during that altercation, I had tried to stop them by telling them that it was not worth it and asking them to stop, which clearly did not work). 

I told them that I felt really uneasy with the idea of having to physically stop them when they are in that state, as they are way bigger and stronger than me. They asked if I trusted them and I said yes, to which they replied that in that case, I should trust that they'd never hurt me....

Well today, one of those situation presented itself to us, once again. We were driving and someone who did not have right of passage tried to cut infront of out car, to which they answered with a honk and proceeded in front of the other vehicle. The lady in the car was flipping us off in the back, so my partner swerved the car back and forth a few times and proceeded to lower the window and flip her off as well. I pleaded with them to please stop and tried to remind them that it wasnt worth our safety, that it wasnt worth all the effort they were putting into being this upset. 

At that point, i was already scared because all the swerving really made me feel unsafe and the situation was dragging on way more than it should of, in my opinion. We then stopped at a stop sign and as we were taking off, the lady screamed something at us. As my partner was taking off, they screamed some vulgar things back at the lady and I did not like the way things were escalating. I spoke loud and clear and demanded that they stopped this behavior right away. Might have slapped them on the shoulder in the heat of the moment (stopping them physically?) In that moment, I was scared that if the lady went the same way we went, my partner was going to keep escalating the matter and since we were in a car and I had no way out, I feared for my safety. 

The lady did not follow us, and we drove the 2minutes back home arguing about why I stopped their behavior. They told me that it was not fair for me to tell them to stop when I also honk and scream at people when im driving (the difference here being that my windows are all up and im just letting this steam out all to myself, while still driving safely).

They had already put me in danger with the swerving and I was feeling really anxious, so im wondering if I did over react by telling them to stop and hitting them on the shoulder, like they claim.

Fast forward a couple months to the day of the concert. I spent the whole morning getting ready, doing hair, makeup etc. He texts me an hour before we’re supposed to leave saying he wasn’t feeling well and didn’t think we could go. I was disappointed, of course, but understood that wasn’t something he could help. He still wanted to hangout that evening though, and seemed completely fine.

He told me he owed me for the tickets and that he would pay me back for both. I appreciated it but wouldn’t have expected him to cover both. He never paid me back but I didn’t want to bug him about it, especially when we were together. 

We broke up a month ago for unrelated reasons and said we were open to staying friends. Long story short, when we did get in touch we ended up arguing and ended things on not the best terms. In the last message I sent him, I mentioned that he never paid me back for the tickets and would appreciate if he would send me his half.

He didn’t respond, so a couple days later I sent an e-transfer request. He then messaged me on instagram saying that he didn’t owe me money and to stop messaging him. I didn’t want to push it and just said, “You’re the one who offered to pay the whole thing and I’m only asking for half. Plus, you’re the reason we didn’t go but whatever.” And left it at that.

Aita for telling my step-sister to leave me alone? I have a problem with my step sister, it’s been like this for a year ever since our parents got married.

Op(16F), stepsister(14F)

My step sister would not leave me alone, one time she barged into my room trying to talk to me, that’s why I had to put locks on my door. The other time when I was in school she went into my room took my clothes and messed with my makeup, she ruined all my makeup which was all over my bathroom and she said she just wanted to do makeup.

I asked my stepdad if he could buy back the makeup his daughter ruined but he said she’s just a kid but that didn’t solve anything, I ended up getting locks for my door so she wouldn’t come in because no adult in this house seems to care. I caught her taking money out my drawer and when I told my mom she ignored me, so I will probably stay at my dad’s more.

I told my mom I had an issue with this but she did nothing and just told me to deal with it, ever since she remarried she doesn’t defend me like a daughter. 

She just gives me an attitude anytime I come to her and I don’t feel wanted at my own house. When my step sister broke my laptop she told me to get over it. If I did a hobby my stepsister would copy after me like she never leaves me alone, that is why I go to my dad's a lot to get away from this. 

My step sister hates when I go by my dads because she said her dad and my mom only arguing so she wants to play with me, I feel like I’m being tortured when I’m around her honestly. Whenever they would fight she would try to sleep with me, I guess it was common for her I don’t know.


My stepsister stole a shirt out of my room when she went to her mom's house and I never got it back, I’m still mad about it because that shirt was gifted to me and it had my grandma's face on it since she passed. 

I would ask her where is my shirt and she would just shrug her shoulders and say the shirt does mean that much. I want it back because who does that? Out of all the shirts she had to take that one, her dad didn’t say anything nor did my mom.

I had plans to go out with my friends to the movie to watch Deadpool so not child appropriate, that’s when my stepsister asked if she could come and I told her no but she continued to ask but I didn’t reply. I was getting frustrated and told her to leave me alone, it was honestly too much for me. Aita?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-12,"AITA for telling my stepsister to leave me alone?

The other time when I was in school she went into my room took my clothes and messed with my makeup, she ruined all my makeup which was all over my bathroom and she said she just wanted to do makeup.

I asked my stepdad if he could buy back the makeup his daughter ruined but he said she’s just a kid but that didn’t solve anything, I ended up getting locks for my door so she wouldn’t come in because no adult in this house seems to care. I caught her taking money out my drawer and when I told my mom she ignored me, so I will probably stay at my dad’s more.

I told my mom I had an issue with this but she did nothing and just told me to deal with it, ever since she remarried she doesn’t defend me like a daughter. 

She just gives me an attitude anytime I come to her and I don’t feel wanted at my own house. When my step sister broke my laptop she told me to get over it. If I did a hobby my stepsister would copy after me like she never leaves me alone, that is why I go to my dad's a lot to get away from this. 

My step sister hates when I go by my dads because she said her dad and my mom only arguing so she wants to play with me, I feel like I’m being tortured when I’m around her honestly. Whenever they would fight she would try to sleep with me, I guess it was common for her I don’t know.


My stepsister stole a shirt out of my room when she went to her mom's house and I never got it back, I’m still mad about it because that shirt was gifted to me and it had my grandma's face on it since she passed. 

I would ask her where is my shirt and she would just shrug her shoulders and say the shirt does mean that much. I want it back because who does that? Out of all the shirts she had to take that one, her dad didn’t say anything nor did my mom.

I had plans to go out with my friends to the movie to watch Deadpool so not child appropriate, that’s when my stepsister asked if she could come and I told her no but she continued to ask but I didn’t reply. I was getting frustrated and told her to leave me alone, it was honestly too much for me. Aita?",0.0,-0.004061618,0,1
16,1eqpwd4,AITA for refusing to inherit the family farm and giving it to my younger brother instead? ,"I (36M) grew up on a big farm that was owned by my family, who worked as farmers for generations. 

Much to the detriment of my parents, I hated the farm life from a very young age. I never liked dirt or grime, and farm animals were also never my thing. 

So to no one’s surprise I left the farm when I turned 18 and never looked back.

I currently live in a big city, I still love my family very much and visit the farm from time to time, but I’m always the happiest when I return to my urban lifestyle. 

My mother passed away 3 years ago, and 2 months ago I unexpectedly lost my father due to a work accident. This left my younger brother Tom (30M) and I, as the sole beneficiaries of their estate. 

I didn’t expect to be left with much, since my folks helped me out financially more than enough times while they were still alive. I honestly only wanted a couple of family trinkets and heirlooms to keep as a keepsake. But to my surprise, as my brother and I sats down with the attorney to discuss our father’s will, we discovered that I was left with the majority of the farm (about 3/4) while Tom was left with the rest. 

The only reason I can fathom behind this decision is that unlike Tom I have 2 children (10M) and (7F), so maybe that’s why I was given the bigger share? But I’m not entirely sure since my children had their own inheritance in the will.

Either way, this split of inheritance was ridiculous, since unlike myself Tom actually lived on the farm and dedicated his entire life to working on it alongside our parents. 

I saw that Tom was also shaken up by the decision, so I reassured him that I found it absurd as well and I don’t mind forfeiting the land to him. Tom said I didn’t have to do that but I insisted. After some back and forth on the topic, we mutually agreed to settle this between ourselves on a later date, when everything would be transferred under our names as our parents intended. 

I recently informed my wife Jules (35F) of my decision regarding my inheritance and she is furious with me for wanting to give most of it up. 

She is arguing that my decision is impulsive and short sighted, since the farm land is worth a fortune and I’m just giving it away without a second thought. 

I told her that the land is worth a fortune only for those who actually intend on doing something with it, and since I neither intend to sell it or farm on it, it’s effectively useless to me. 

Jules continued to say that it might be useless to me, but I should think about our children who might one day want to start farming. I told her in that case I’ll transfer only half of the land to Tom, so our children could have a 1/4 of the land at their disposal in the hypothetical scenario they get into farming one day. 

Jules is now not speaking with me until I reconsider my decision, I need to hear some unbiased opinions to see if I’m in the wrong here.

17,1eqpltx,AITA for calling my aunt a selfish and rude bitch?,"My(19M) grandma just passed away on the 4th of this month. It was really rough on our entire family and our entire world came crashing down. She had dementia but was expected to live another
2-4 years. Her death was an accident, most likely an aneurysm, and was quick.

Unfortunately her and my grandfather live about 4 states away from where I do, so my parents rushed out to be with my grandfather during this time. The day after she passed away they arrive and we start making arrangements for her funeral.

As we're checking dates with our family and making sure her funeral and wake won't conflict with birthdays, my aunt texts my mom.
Reminder, this is **the day after my grandmother passed away**. She texts my mom

""I'm just making sure you know that the funeral and wake cannot be September 8-20, I have a trip to Hawaii planned. Also, what are we doing with mom's rings?""

This fucking woman, **THE DAY AFTER HER MOM DIED** wanted to make sure we knew she had a trip to Hawaii and wanted to know what we were doing with my grandmothers extensive collection of jewelry.

For some more context, my grandmother hasn't spoken to my aunt in almost 2 years, and I haven't spoken to her (on purpose) for nearly 3. But that's a story for another day.

So my aunt calls me, sending her
condolences...but she REALLY wants to know what we're doing with my grandmothers stuff!

My grandma isn't even back from The crematorium yet, she's not even done being turned to ashes and she wants to know. Me, having loved my grandmother to the ends of the goddamn Earth, blow up on her.

I called her entitled, selfish, crude, and a massive bitch. I told her she's never getting any of my grandmothers stuff because she left it to me (which she did). I told her to fuck off and continue to not speak to me.

I've gotten a few texts from that side of the family calling me rude. But honestly I do feel a bit bad, I was emotionally drained and unstable, but I feel she deserved every word.

19,1eqpfo9,AITA (22f) for commenting on 31F’s husbands post (30m)?,"
Backstory: My boyfriend runs a lawn care company. He is also very good friends with another guy who also runs a lawn care company. Let’s call him John. I have met John two times before. He knows who I am. I wouldn’t say we are friends.

They both run their social media pages (Instagram, TikTok, Facebook) to try to gain traction and more customers. I of course try my best to support my boyfriend’s small business by commenting, liking, sharing, etc. My boyfriend also shares John’s posts with me. I went ahead and followed John’s instagram like six months ago (when he started his new business) I have commented three times, liked his photos maybe 10 times (when they show up on my feed), and that’s about the extent of my interaction.

My comments have included:

“Landscaping looks great”
“Love the song” (referring to a background song on a post).
“Great work”

Of course I do this to try to boost his interaction on Instagram so he can gain more customers. I’m just trying to be nice. I don’t have any interest in John whatsoever. Just trying to support my boyfriend’s friend.

Anyways now to the real story.

I receive a direct message today on Instagram from a girl. I look at who it is. It’s John’s wife (who I never met, but have heard about). Let’s call her Amy. Amy has met my boyfriend on numerous occasions. She knows who I am. I have met her once. 

Her message says “How much time do you spend commenting on my husband's page?”

I said “Hi! I’m *my boyfriend’s name’s* girlfriend. Didn’t mean to cause any trouble, just commenting so it boosts his interaction!”

She said: “Ok, your comments aren’t normal because they have nothing to do with his account. You better not do it again because I don't like it. “

I said: “I’m so sorry I truly didn’t mean to cause any trouble. I will unfollow him and stop interacting. Have a nice day!”

She said: “You better stop or you don’t know what’s coming your way. Watch your back.” With a knife emoji. 

Am I in the wrong here? I truly didn’t mean anything by it. John comments on my boyfriend’s instagram all the time. I was just trying to be nice. It was only 3 comments. Now she’s threatening me.

So, I’m 15 and I still go to school obviously, when I’m at school, I try to avoid using my phone for any reason because I want to focus on my studies.
One day at the end of the school day, I was walking home and I checked my phone for the first time since school began. When I first unlocked it, messages came flooding in from my cousin.
At first, she was asking me if I could organize her gender reveal party, since I had done it once before for my other cousin and everything was really nice and had went really well. However, after
 that she started getting annoyed since I wasn’t replying to her, and she said that if I couldn’t do it then I should just say so and not “ghost her”.
I told her that the reason I did not reply was since I was at school, and I also said that the date she chose was really not proper for me since it was  during the time of my final exams, however that was really not the case, I just didn’t want to do it for her since she’s never been nice to me and has just been a pain in the ass in general. There are many things she’s done, yet I don’t want to get into the history of anything.
Anyways, she told her mom (my aunt) this information, and one day during a family gathering my aunt mentioned it to my mom that it was a shame I couldn’t organize it due to my finals. 
My mom told her that my finals were way before that and that I wouldn’t have anything to do during that time. 
My cousin was there when that was said, yet I wasn’t, so my cousin kept on continuously texting me and asking me why I lied, then she started guilt tripping me and saying that she’s been nothing but nice to me.
It started off with that, however it then slowly evolved to her calling me horrible names and saying stuff like she wishes I was never born.

I don’t think I did anything wrong here, I don’t need to organize anything if I don’t want to and she needs to accept that in my opinion. However, my mom is saying that I was completely in the wrong and that my cousin is a sweetheart, and she truly got upset that I said no.

25,1eqof7o,AITA for asking my parents to accommodate me? ,"Here’s the situation- 

My partner and I live together in a town let’s call Fields. My parents live back in Chicagoland, and my extended family in southern IL.

An organization my partner is involved with is hosting a fundraiser this upcoming weekend. To spread the hype, I simply invited all of my extended family to the fundraiser via text months ago. Didn’t really intend anything by it, literally just said “ hey this is going on this date if anybody is looking for something to do.” 

My parents and a couple extended family members are planning to come. I also have a distant relative who lives in this town, and all the family members are planning to stay at his house. I stayed at his house for a few months when I first moved here, and really despised living there (kind of a dump, lots of spiders and mold, passive aggressive host, a few arguments…).

My parents were shocked and are now angry at me that I am not intending to leave my place to stay with them at my family member’s house for the two nights of the weekend. My mother sees it as “inappropriate” that I am not staying with the family. They are also extremely angry that I have not planned a whole slew of events/ otherwise planned an entire weekend outing for all the family that are coming. To clarify, I do intend to see them outside of the event, maybe get dinner or breakfast or do something, but they are expecting me to be reaching out to every individual member in advance, with a schedule for the entire weekend, kind of coordinating something on the scale of a small reunion. 

To attempt resolve the issue, I did offer to stay with the family, but asked if there was any other place we could stay….maybe get a cheap hotel, etc. This was not an acceptable solution to them, apparently, as after 24 hours of radio silence, I got a paragraph text essentially accusing me of being extremely self-centered and explaining how they “are mystified by the attitudes I exhibit”, the excuse for not staying at the house is “completely ridiculous” etc…

26,1eqodyr,AITA for wanting my wife to quit her habit after quoting mine?,"I (40M) recently quit drinking energy drinks because my wife (38F) said how bad they are for you and that I have also suffered previously from Kidney stones. I don’t get them all the time mind you, but I have had them twice in my life and the last bout about 8 months ago was brutal. 

I didn’t like how she came at me when arguing about it, but upon some reflection I conceded because she is 100% correct and I really don’t have a good argument other than I really enjoyed how they taste. I decided to stop drinking them and have gone 2 weeks so far without any and plan on abstaining from drinking them anymore.

I ended up quitting energy drinks the same time she went on a trip for about a week. During that time, I decided that she should also quit her habit of Vaping as well, since that is also very bad for your health IMO, not to mention that it costs much more than me drinking one energy drink per day.

She previously was a Smoker and a few years ago transitioned to Vaping. I wished then that she quit cold turkey, but much preferred Vaping to Smoking, so I was content. She was a smoker for years before I met her and I have accepted it; especially since we have had several arguments in the past about how she should quit and it never ends well. She always gets angry immediately and shuts down and is unwilling to talk and if I press, she becomes irate.

So when she got back from her week long trip, I brought it up to here that I stopped drinking energy drinks and that I think she should quit too, using the same arguments she used against me. It of course went exactly the same way that the previous requests went, which is nowhere and again she shut down and would not talk about it at all.

I think that I am valid and it is a comparable request, but since she doesn’t think so and how unwilling she is to have a conversation, I am rethinking my position.

27,1eqod6e,AITA for refusing to go to a family holiday planned by my husband,"Hi this is a throw away account since I do not use reddit but my daughter told me I can find advice here. English is not my first language so pardon my mistakes. Me(44f) and my husband(50m) have been married for 21 years. My husband has a mother who is 67 years old and she has some health issues with her leg and also has stomach problems. My fil is not in the picture and my husband is an only child.

Around spring this year we decided to take a family vacation to a family house in a rural mountain area. Our plan was to visit family and some famous historical places together but the plans did not hold up and the vacation was delayed by 1 month. It now holds more work since it is harvesting season and my husbands aunt had asked for our help with the reaping. My husband wants us to go all together, taking his mother on the way to a 15 hour long drive. He made some plans to visit different places in different cities along the way and also help his aunt through out the vacation. He says harvesting will not take more than a few days but last year it was a whole week and our whole vacation it took to finish. Also the work is simply tiring.

The problem arose when I refused to go. Our car is small, the work is exhausting and simply I know the travel plans will not workout when my mil is with us. She is an elderly woman and wants to spend time with his son which is completely fine by me but when she is there, the places my husband claims we will visit will create so much problems. We had family trips with my mil and the kids before(my husband was not with us for work related issues) and I have experienced said problems. So I said I will stay behind and him and our children along with my mil can go all together. He will not accept this and tonight he told me he needed me to do personal chores while harvesting goes in place(doing the laundry was the example he told) because he is not comfortable with his aunt to taking care of all that

Another reason he wants me there is that he doesn't want me to stay behind to work(we run a small cafe together) while whole family is going on a vacation.

28,1eqoa1a,AITA for wearing shorts to clean my car? please help ,"My boyfriend doesn’t like my shorts. 

So it all started last week. I (30F) wore shorts all day at home and decided to run to the store. When I get back, my landlord (who got married this week) was in the driveway. He asked to come in and fix my sink, so I let him in. I was having a couple drinks and we were chatting about things the previous landlord fixed, current events, plans he has for renovations, etc. I wanted to show him something upstairs so I walked up in front of him. We were talking about other things so we went up and down a couple times. Meanwhile, my boyfriend (39M) was in the other room, silent. When the landlord left, he started saying that it was wrong to walk up the stairs in front of my landlord in shorts. In all fairness, the shorts may have rode up a bit and I didn’t notice because of the drinks, but in no way was it intentional. He says that I walked up the stairs 3 times on purpose. He says I’m an attention whore and have no respect for myself because I should know better than to use the stairs in front of another man when I’m wearing shorts. BF said this is hoe-ish behavior and I was acting like a hooker. 

So again, I wore shorts the other day because it was over 80 degrees and humid. We went to the car wash, and I was bending over to pick up some trash. Again, he starts making comments about me saying I’m out of my mind. I didn’t even know what he was talking about, but he told me later that he thinks I did it on purpose. He thinks I parked my car so that a guy who was cleaning his car a few spots down would look at me. Going as far as to say I’m “hypersexual” and looking for attention. I say that I don’t even think of things like that, I would never park my car in hopes of getting someone’s attention, and my shorts were not even very short. I tried to explain that it was not intentional, and I didn’t bend over in my mirror before I left so I didn’t know how the shorts would look in that position. Now he’s making comments about how he’s going to “go out and act like me” and if he “unintentionally falls out and slips into some buns” he “didn’t mean to do it intentionally, it just happened out of nowhere.” 

I’ll post pictures of the shorts on my page since there are no attachments allowed here. Of course when you bend over in any shorts, they ride up. I’m not saying they didn’t but I am saying that they are not super tight, super short shorts. They’re regular length jean shorts. And the insinuation that I parked my car in a particular spot to get attention is outlandish in my opinion. 

Please let me know if I’m an asshole for defending myself. He says I’m trying to justify bad behavior but in my eyes, I just didn’t want to be hot. 

TLDR: I wore fingertip length shorts and bent down to clean my car, my bf thinks I parked the car in a specific place to get the attention of another guy who was at the car wash, but I wasn’t paying attention to that. I was just cleaning my car and didn’t want to be hot. He says it’s because I have no respect for him or myself.

30,1eqo8aw,AITA for getting my partner a cologne another male coworker wears?,"Hi everyone, 

I was in a long-term relationship with my significant other for 11 years, and we've been having some major issues (this is one of the main instances) stemming from a Christmas gift I got him a few years ago. This situation has been a significant point of conflict for us, and it ultimately contributed to our breakup.

One Christmas, I wanted to get my SO a nice cologne. After noticing how good a scent smelled on one of my male coworkers (who is also a friend), I asked him what cologne he wore because I really liked it. My partner is really into colognes and  I thought it would make a great gift for my SO I bought it. 

However, when my SO found out later on that I chose that particular cologne because a coworker wore it, he completely flipped out. He accused me of cheating and became convinced that I was somehow attached to this coworker because of the cologne choice.

Fast forward to now, the tension over this gift has lingered and contributed to our constant fights, ultimately leading to our breakup. I’m not joking I feel like I’m going insane. This argument has been going on for a few years now and it was just brought up to me today again! I had to move across the country because he’s unrelenting! I’m starting to doubt myself and I could really use some insight.

So, AITA for getting him a cologne simply because I liked the way it smelled, even if it was a scent worn by another guy? Thanks in advance!

She writes poetry about him til today. Also i have been diagnosed with BPD which makes me more jealous and sensitive than most people. Not an excuse for anything, just an explanation for why i might react the way i do.)

Unbeknownst to me, they were actually his ex’s closest friends. They both have private accounts and didn’t accept my requests but they did screenshot my account after noticing i was dating my bf and they started talking shit about me in their groupchats. 

Somehow, my bf was sent screenshots of their groupchats and told me about it but he hasn’t shown me what they were saying about me. A couple days later, i noticed that another friend of my bf who i had been following for a while had soft-blocked me on instagram. I asked my bf why she would do that and he said that his ex might have spoken shit about me to her and made her remove me. 

His ex’s friends also started stalking my stories and sent me a couple dms. (this is where i know i didn’t make a good couple of decisions) i went to his ex’s profile and noticed that she posted 15 hours ago and i got the idea to leave a comment. i commented “so pretty” and a few hours later my bf started angrily blowing up my phone saying that i can’t do things like that and that i was basically bullying her. 

I got upset at this and felt like he was choosing her side, and essentially he was defending her to me but he didn’t defend me to her. i noticed that she blocked me so i spoke to a couple of my friends about it and sent them screenshots showing that all i said was “so pretty”. Without me knowing they chose to comment on her post as well, to back me up as their friend. 

When my bf found out about their comments he became extremely upset and began fighting with me about it again. He kept saying that i was the bad person in the situation and i was a bully. Her friends all blocked me except one who still sends me hateful dm requests and stalks my profile. 

Am i wrong for wanting my bf to have my back regardless of the situation, especially since it was me vs his ex, or was he right for defending his ex?

tl;dr : my bfs ex started speaking shit about me to our mutuals because she’s still in love with my bf. i reacted by commenting “so pretty” on her post which made my bf angry because “i was bullying her” (in his words). i feel like my bf doesn’t have my back and chose his ex’s side in this situation.

edit: a lot of you seem to misunderstand why i followed these girls in the first place. i didn’t know they were friends with his ex and had no way of finding that out since they had private accounts. i followed them because they kept popping up on my suggested and i have a habit of following people on my suggested, especially if we have mutuals, the mutual being my bf in this case. it wasn’t out of jealousy or suspicion, just genuinely following girls because that’s what i do, that’s how i make friends. ",Everyone Sucks,2024-08-12,"AITA for commenting on my bf’s ex’s instagram post? I’ve been getting a lot of advice and opinions about this from my friends, but i’m posting it here to see if they were biased or not. I know this might seem small and stupid but all the tension of actually being in this situation made everything feel like a big deal.

(For some context, i’m the second girl my bf has dated since his ex, who hasn’t gone on a date since they broke up in december because she’s still in love with him. She writes poetry about him til today. Also i have been diagnosed with BPD which makes me more jealous and sensitive than most people. Not an excuse for anything, just an explanation for why i might react the way i do.)

About a week ago, i (20f) followed some girls who’s accounts kept popping up on my suggested because they were mutuals with my bf (21m). Unbeknownst to me, they were actually his ex’s closest friends. They both have private accounts and didn’t accept my requests but they did screenshot my account after noticing i was dating my bf and they started talking shit about me in their groupchats. 

Somehow, my bf was sent screenshots of their groupchats and told me about it but he hasn’t shown me what they were saying about me. A couple days later, i noticed that another friend of my bf who i had been following for a while had soft-blocked me on instagram. I asked my bf why she would do that and he said that his ex might have spoken shit about me to her and made her remove me.

34,1eqn9mk,AITA for telling (23F) my bf (25M) that he shouldn’t get a motorcycle in Florida? ,"
My boyfriend and I live together in Florida and he randomly decided that he wants to get a motorcycle because of the thrill of it. I agree, they’re nice to look at and seem super fun to ride. But I’m also a nurse, and I’ve heard of how dangerous they can be and how ER workers call them organ cycles. I’ve read that Florida is one of the most dangerous states to own a motorcycle and the city that we live in is listed as one of the top five most dangerous cities on multiple websites. Someone I know lost their leg in a motorcycle accident and someone my mom knew died. It just doesn’t seem worth it to me. 

I know that I may be in the wrong because it’s something he wants. However, he never grew up with one, it’s not something tied to his soul that he’s been surrounded with since he was young. He doesn’t even ride dirt bikes. He wants one just for the thrill, or he quotes “a man wants a bike”. The police department in our city even released something saying that motorcycle riders have been passing away every other week in our city and I’ve seen dozens of comments on Reddit explaining how people have been riding for years and won’t ride in Florida because of how dangerous it felt when they did. I’ve tried explaining my point of view, and ask him to at least reconsider once we move out of Florida within the next year or two. Everyone said that he should sign up to be an organ donor or have me be his beneficiary, but I’d like to grow old with my partner. 

He keeps shutting me down and tells me to leave him alone when I try to express my concern for his safety. It’s been really stressing me out because I don’t want to have to constantly live in fear because my boyfriend wants to buy a motorcycle in one of the most dangerous places for them. He’s never driven one, has only had his driver’s licenses for 1 1/2 years, and he has anger problems. That’s also a big concern for me. When he misses a turn, there are times when he will yell and it’s kinda scary. He always goes fast around curves and even my mom noticed that his driving was a tad reckless when she rode with us and told me I should talk to him about his car driving. 

Now he’s yelling at me and telling me that I always won’t let him do anything in life, when I never say anything about anything he does except this. I got so stressed and started crying because I didn’t know how else to think to cope with it when he kept shutting me down, and he just started laughing. He never takes advice from me, but seems to constantly listen to other people. My biggest concern is his safety and I just have a really bad feeling about him getting on the road, especially in a state as dangerous as Florida. People commented on my other post saying they’ve been riding for years around the U.S. and put it away when they moved to Florida because they’re scared they’ll die here. And I think it speaks a lot of volume if someone’s been riding for 10+ years and sells it once they move here in order to not risk their life. I’m just trying to find a compromise with him, like him get one after we move out of the most dangerous state, nonetheless the most dangerous city. Does anyone have any advice on how to proceed with this? Thank you! ",No A-holes here,2024-08-12,"AITA for telling (23F) my bf (25M) that he shouldn’t get a motorcycle in Florida?

i ended up getting extremely mad at her and telling her to quote “f*** off, and stop invading my privacy” my mom had arrived home aswell and heard me yelling at her, she came upstairs and also scolded my sister (my mom has always told us to respect each others privacy), but when my dad got home she went crying to him saying she was just trying to find a charger (bs,as i only keep my charger in my room and it doesn’t work on her phone) my dad ended up yelling at me telling me that we’re sisters and sisters always share, and that i should learn how to respect other people and not just myself.

my mom ended up yelling at him, and they got into a massive argument. my sister went on twitter ranting about how horrible of a sister i am, and that i have no respect for her and blah blah, her friends found my social media account and have been messaging me calling me an asshole who has no respect for their younger sister.

37,1eqmvw8,AITA for asking for clarification from a professor before jumping to conclusions?,"I'm (F21) doing my master's in English at a university with a frustrating course selection system. We have to choose from specific courses under different English literature rubrics every semester, but they're first-come, first-serve with limited spots (25-40) in a class of 120 students. It’s tough because we all need these courses to graduate, but some professors make exceptions.

One professor decided to give priority to the first 40 students on a list she received from the management. A classmate (M21) started aggressively tagging the professor in our group chat, calling her decision to limit the class to 40 students problematic. He did this even before the final list of students was announced, without knowing if he got in or not.

I sent a polite message in the chat right after, asking the professor if she could share the final list so everyone would know if they got in and whether they should attend the class. I was worried I didn’t get in, and I thought it was important to know before pointing out concerns.

Immediately after, my classmate DMed me, calling me a thoughtless moron who enabled the professor’s decision to take only 40 students. He sent angry voicemails, shouting that I was stupid for sending the message and not thinking about the 80 students who might not get in. I stayed calm and firm, explaining that I wasn’t agreeing with the system but simply asking for the list so everyone could check. I told him to stop using me as a vessel for his frustration.

He then insulted me, saying I was worthless among other things and should keep quiet when he was arguing on behalf of our classmates. Then the list came out. Some final year students didn’t make the cut, but both he and I got in. When I pointed this out, he said he wasn’t selfish and still cared about those who didn’t get in. Finally, I snapped and called him a bastard for blaming me for the professor’s decision and acting like I personally designed the uni's terrible course system and kicked people out personally

Later, the students who didn’t get in started pleading with the professor to let them in, and my classmate blamed me, threatening to cuss me out in the group chat if I made things worse. Looking back, he was stressed and scared he wouldn’t graduate, but so were all of us. However, I didn’t resort to cussing people out over well-meaning questions. Now, I’m worried that my asking for the list in the group chat instead of in person might have caused confusion and misunderstanding.

My uncle is very judgemental of me and it makes my mother very anxious, as he often makes comments about her parenting skills and implies that she failed to raise me properly.

I have never spent time with my uncle alone, and usually, my mother acts as a buffer between us. I was nervous to spend time with him alone, and potentially say the wrong thing, which would cause him to gossip to my family about my mother's poor parenting skills, and cause tension between us. I am also neurodivergent and worry that I may say something awkward in social situations.

Hence, I politely declined and insisted that I had a very short lunch break that day, assuring him that I would be visiting with my parents at the end of the month, to help him plan his son's engagement party.

43,1eqlmmo,AITA for not going to my best friend’s bday party because she invited my narcissistic ex-friend ,"my(26f) friend sarah(25f) always hosts her bday party at her apartment. at her party last year, she invited my toxic ex-best friend jenna(26f).it became clear to me that jenna is a narcissist and i just couldn’t see past it anymore. it was awkward to be at the party with her. it’s an intimate space and everyone can see everyone.where she was standing was blocking the bathroom, drinks, and snacks, so i stayed closer to the front door. i kept catching jenna looking over at me. sarah was nowhere to be found, as she’s usually overwhelmed with the amount of people she invites and is too chaotic to socialize with anyone. i wasn’t enjoying myself and i was uncomfortable being in such a tight space with jenna,so i found sarah and said bye. i could tell it bummed her out a bit since we hadn’t spent more much time together,but there were many other people there and i knew she would be fine.

for v-day this year sarah threw another house party. when she told me about it,i politely brought up that i would not go if jenna was invited. sarah started seeing jenna’s toxicity,but sarah is a people pleaser and felt like she had to invite jenna out of fear of her seeing photos on social media after. i said i didn’t mind if she invited jenna but,to respect my own boundaries,i would sit that party out. it’s the day before and sarah tells me she had an internal conflict about inviting jenna,emphasizing posting photos. sarah didn’t end up inviting jenna and it was a good party.

now it’s time for sarah’s bday this year and it’s at her house again. i went to rsvp to the evite and i saw that jenna had responded going. this caught me off guard. the last time sarah and i spoke about jenna,we agreed that she was bad vibes. however, i was scrolling around on IG and i saw a photo jenna posted a few weeks earlier with a caption indicating sarah had taken the photo. this really hurt me. sarah hadn’t mentioned hanging out with jenna at all. it felt suspicious that sarah was keeping it from me, like she withheld it on purpose. i knew i didn’t want to put myself through last year’s party situation again, given that it will have been a year since i saw jenna in person. i rsvp’d yes because sarah texted me about the invite and i didn’t want to disappoint her. as it gets closer, i can’t help but get more nervous. i really don’t want to go, but i know it would hurt sarah’s feelings. however, it hurts my feelings that my bff of 9 years doesn’t care about my boundaries and invites jenna to her party out of fear of jenna’s feelings. in her need to people please everybody else, it makes me sad that she isn’t even upfront with me about this. it makes me wonder if she was even going to give me a heads up that jenna will be there. i want to support sarah, but i’ve done a lot of personal growth since breaking off my friendship with jenna and i just can’t subject myself to being around her anymore.

44,1eqlafu,AITA for going back in moving in with my boyfriend,"So I (21F) have been with my boyfriend (28M) for almost two years now. Currently I'm living in an apartment with 3 housemates near my university. My boyfriend lives with his mom, who is rarely home, about 30 mins away. Therefore I spend a lot of time at my boyfriend's place as it is where we can get the most alone time together. 

He has been asking me to move in for a few months now. I've generally just said I'd love to live with him and I would love to live with him. Now that I have thought about it I realised I don't really want to move in with him. Mostly because it's his mom's house so I'd have to pay rent to her and that feels like an awkward situation to put myself in. I'm also autistic and have a lot of special interests that I like to surround myself with. I know it sounds silly, but having cute Sanrio plushies and anime figures around my room with a pink colour palate is really important to me. He's also autistic but has other different interests his room (that I would be moving into) is decorated with. 

I do genuinely love my boyfriend so much and would love to live with him, just not in that house or situation. I told him this and he got pretty upset saying that he doesn't understand why I'd want to live in my own place with housemates I don't like rather than with him.

51,1eqk5bi,AITA for refusing to participate in a “grandma shower” at my office?,"Hi Reddit. I admittedly have some bias when it comes to baby-related stuff so I could use some opinions. 

Something about my workplace—remember the “party planning committee” in The Office? Well, we basically have that. The committee usually is responsible for buying everyone a cake&card on their birthday and we’ll have themed lunches every now and then—4th of July BBQ, International potluck for the Olympics, Cinco de Mayo tacos—you get the gist. Now, an important element of this story is the fact that I’ve always loved baking & am quite good at it. So every time we have a themed lunch, I always bring a baked good that fits the theme. It’s gotten to the point where people are always trying to guess what I’ll bring and are always super excited to see what I’ll do next. Generally, I love it and have fun with it. Until now. 

About a week ago, my coworker announced she’s expecting a granddaughter in the fall. An email went around and I sent congratulations. Fine. However, since then, the party planning committee has announced that we will be hosting a “grandma shower” for my coworker for lunch next week and they’ve been circulating a sign up sheet for everyone to bring food as well as the baby registry and encouraging everyone to participate in a “diaper drive”. Notably—I’ve never met my coworker’s daughter and thus seriously doubt I’d ever meet this baby girl. 

So far, there have been about six emails about this “shower”. I’ve been ignoring them all. Then, today, one of my coworkers came into my office and asked why I hadn’t signed up to bring dessert yet? 

Now, here’s where I may be TA. I basically told her I wasn’t planning on baking something and didn’t think I was going to participate in the “shower”. When asked why, I just said that tbh, I don’t know coworker’s daughter and didn’t really feel like getting someone I don’t know a present for a baby I’ll never meet. My coworker made a face and said she understood but that “grandma” coworker might be disappointed. 

On the one hand, I feel like maybe I’m TA and I could have just baked some brownies and called it a day to participate and not hurt anyone’s feelings. But on the other hand, I find it absolutely ridiculous to host a “grandma shower” and expect people to bring gifts for a random baby. 

I feel like I am right in standing on principle on this but at the same time I know I have some bias here. For context, my husband and I have been trying to have a baby for years and we are currently undergoing IVF treatments so I know I’m a little sensitive about babies right now. No one at work knows, so I know they’re not trying to be cruel. But at the same time, being confronted with babies left and right is also extremely draining for me. 

Idk, Reddit—AITA for refusing to participate or should I just suck it up and participate with everyone else? 

Editing to add some additional context:

As many people have guessed—yes this is the south and the party planning committee is all Southern white women in their 50/60s. I didn’t realize how glaringly obvious that was lol! 

As far as “grandma” is concerned, I don’t necessarily think she pushed for the shower but she’s definitely going along with it. Not sure if that affects anyone’s opinion but I saw several people assume she’s a MIL from hell and I don’t necessarily think that is the case. 

Also—mom-to-be apparently had a baby shower last weekend and another email has been sent out about an hour ago stating that they got so many infant sized diapers at their shower that they’re asking we buy diapers the next size up for the “granny shower”. I…don’t know what to even say to that. 

& yes, we got bad news IVF-wise last week and I realize I’m emotional and may not be super objective right now 😔",Not the A-hole,2024-08-12,"AITA for refusing to participate in a “grandma shower” at my office? Hi Reddit. I admittedly have some bias when it comes to baby-related stuff so I could use some opinions. 

Something about my workplace—remember the “party planning committee” in The Office? Well, we basically have that. The committee usually is responsible for buying everyone a cake&card on their birthday and we’ll have themed lunches every now and then—4th of July BBQ, International potluck for the Olympics, Cinco de Mayo tacos—you get the gist. Now, an important element of this story is the fact that I’ve always loved baking & am quite good at it. So every time we have a themed lunch, I always bring a baked good that fits the theme. It’s gotten to the point where people are always trying to guess what I’ll bring and are always super excited to see what I’ll do next. Generally, I love it and have fun with it. Until now. 

About a week ago, my coworker announced she’s expecting a granddaughter in the fall. An email went around and I sent congratulations. Fine. However, since then, the party planning committee has announced that we will be hosting a “grandma shower” for my coworker for lunch next week and they’ve been circulating a sign up sheet for everyone to bring food as well as the baby registry and encouraging everyone to participate in a “diaper drive”. Notably—I’ve never met my coworker’s daughter and thus seriously doubt I’d ever meet this baby girl. 

So far, there have been about six emails about this “shower”. I’ve been ignoring them all. Then, today, one of my coworkers came into my office and asked why I hadn’t signed up to bring dessert yet? 

Now, here’s where I may be TA. I basically told her I wasn’t planning on baking something and didn’t think I was going to participate in the “shower”. When asked why, I just said that tbh, I don’t know coworker’s daughter and didn’t really feel like getting someone I don’t know a present for a baby I’ll never meet.

I had met Andy twice before and he was very nice, we got along. But rhis time I went out with them and Victor, who I had never met before.

53,1eqjvxp,AITA for not immediately unfollowing an ex?,"I (26m) was told by my gf (25f) to unfollow my ""ex"" because she didn't feel comfortable with it. The problem I had with this is that she was barely an ex. We were ""officially"" together for a month before we realized we just weren't going to work. We never kissed. Never went on a proper date. Everytime we were together was with mutual friends. Never held hands. Maybe she leaned on my arm a few times. That was it. After that we remained friends. Over the year we talked less and less but we still kept in touch via social media. 

I didn't really understand what the issue was. I hardly saw her as an ex, we have mutual friends and it was all kind of a nothing burger. 

Fast forward some time later and she tells me again that I should unfollow her and that it wasn't a discussion. I conceded, thinking it wasn't worth the trouble. I hadn't spoken to my ex in a long time, so why get in an argument about it? I unfollowed her and let it go. 

Fast forward again a week and my gf posts a screenshot of a random number saying they were sorry if they hurt her feelings and she asking who it was.  Turns out it was some guy she used to sext about 3 years before her and I got together. The thing is though is that I know who the guy is and he followed her socials and she back. I told her how come it was okay for her to follow him when she has somewhat of a history with him while I barely have a history with my ""ex""?

Now we were all invited to the girls birthday, which was fine and all my friend stayed over at my place we picked up someone else (il call her liz) and went there as a group seeing mike lives across the country and traveling together is simply cheaper. We all wanted to see what this girl (ill call het max) was actually like. max was forward and fun to be around online but when we got to the birthday she was not just a little shy she was a completely different person to all of us.



We came there when her entire family was over so it started super awkward but we tried to push past it. we went for a walk all of us talked but max didn't really interact with any of us outside of my friend Mike. when we got back to the house it took for over a hour to have max sit with us and even then she barely spoke to us. a part of us were meant to stay for the night but every single person wanted to go home as fast as we could we were just uncomfortable.



when we were about to leave we stepped out of the backyard and the gate to try and talk with all of us before going, max didn't stand with us she went back inside until we had to go. when driving home mike said he was gonna go back and stay the night when liz and i who at this point were both stressed & tired got annoyed with him asking why. He was the only person of our friend group she really talked to or spend time with and it felt more like she invited all of us to have mike come over.

we tried to convince him not to go but he dropped us off at home and went back.



yesterday during the evening i talked with mike about this all, i wanted to see if he was sure because how all of us felt about it as we all saw massive red flags from her but his happiness is more important to me.



by now we had both talked to someone else to see if we were shitty friends or if our gut feeling was right. max had said to someone she didn't care which one of 2 guys she kissed at the party during dare or drink games (mike and another friend) as long as she could try someone.



liz had someone mention when max went on vacation she was flirting with 2 guys, when both caught feelings she just ended up hooking up with 1 of them leaving the other to feel like shit. liz and i both agreed that if this all is true he will realize it on his own.



as his friend i can't tell him who to date and who not to date. but at the same time i can't help but feel like he is rushing into this as he has done that before with relationships only to get into a toxic one.

Since she's visiting me, I got to treat her. I know she would do the same for me.

My boyfriend and I went out to the same restaurant the next day (Sunday) and we split the bill. 

My bf was upset that I had treated my friend and not him. I told him that we had different dynamics. My bf and I split bills while my friend and I switch between treating each other and splitting the bill. 

He said it was unfair and asked if I would every treat him just because. I said not unless it's his birthday. AITA?",0.0,0.9705572,1,0
60,1eqit91,AITA for not having an in-depth discussion with my sister about why I won't babysit her two daughters while she has her third child?,"My sister (38f) asked me (26f) if I would babysit her two daughters (5f and 4f) while she gives birth to her third child. I told her no because I don't feel comfortable babysitting them. My sister asked me why and I told her that the girls not getting along and all the trouble between them is more than I could handle for an unknown amount of time. I told her there was nothing that would make me more willing to babysit in these circumstances.

For those wondering how bad it can be between them, it's bad. Sibling rivalry, or whatever this is, has been awful between them since they started any kind of independent play. They're very mean to each other. They get very loud together because they'll scream at each other and throw things so the other can't play with it. There is no setting where they can get along. My parents have babysat them together and they told me it was exhausting and none of the consequences for being mean/acting out helped them calm down. My dad said it was like two fighting cats and nothing short of separating them calms things down.

My sister and I went out with the girls before she got pregnant. Just a girls day out. I wasn't even alone with them then and I felt out of my depth. They fought the whole day and

The oldest says she hates her sister a lot. While the youngest is the loudest during any fight or when she's expressing an issue with her sister.

The hug it out method that my sister and her husband use never works. They refuse to touch at all let alone hug.

They can never find a hired babysitter who'll keep the girls for the agreed time. They always get called home early from dates. They've tried over 20 babysitters.

My sister is aware of the problems between her girls. She doesn't like when anyone tries to give advice about what to do. So I didn't go into more details with her when I was explaining why. But she said we needed to sit down and have a more in-depth discussion about my reasons because she wants to try and figure something out seeing as I'm the best person for the job. I told her we have no reason to have this discussion, that she needs to accept my no and find someone else to babysit.

She told me it's too risky for her to deliver alone because she's always had complicated deliveries. Her husband needs to be beside her and not home with the girls. So I need to talk this out with her and help her.

I also asked what she meant when she said I represent her sibling, if the meant my husband or myself as a sister? She responded positively that her mom was wrong for saying that and that she worded her text strangely but since she doesn't have any sisters she would love for the only in-law one she has to be there. So I am going to RSVP yes!

ETA: 4 days not 2 weeks,  MIL had previously told me she wouldn't care if I came

My SIL is having a bridal shower 2.5 hrs away from where I live on a highway with terrible traffic. Another family member is flying in for it. Her mother had told me that SIL wouldn't care if I went or not. So when SIL texted me I responded ""would you be upset if I don't make it up there? I've been drowning lately 😭"". (I have been, I work from home with my kids and summer has been rough. I've  been crying a lot and just beaten to a pulp.) Her response was: ""Yeah honestly I'd be pretty bummed since you're so close and you represent the one sibling I have and I only get one bridal shower 😩 but you gotta do what's best for you!!!""
Can y'all please give me your opinions on the vibe of this message? I felt weird about it. She did not comment at all about me drowning, and said ""you represent my sibling"" which is a lot different than saying ""i would miss your presence"". Her also saying ""since you're so close"" sounds judgy or guilting to me which I don't care for. We went to the engagement party and are going to the wedding. I guess I'm mostly worried about judgment from family members. She did not attend my baby shower last year but she did come down and help out after I had my baby for 4 days because she had 2 weeks off in between switching jobs, which I was grateful for (I have 3 kids). Oh, also, I am NOT in the wedding party and neither is my husband, which you would think he would be if him being represented is so important. I am not upset about it but just don't understand the double standard there. We are not close and I don't think we've ever had a really deep conversation. I am looking for outside opinions because I have been wrong before and tend to assume the worst of people. Some people Ive talked to have said I should just suck it up and go and I might have fun, any maybe I would, but thinking about sitting in a car for 5 hrs with smokers for a 1.5 hr event sounds absolutely soul crushing to me right now.

I haven't started college yet, but my parents said I need to start working, so I got a job, and am working 16 hours a week (so that I can continue the same shifts when college starts) but even before applying, I expressed that I don't think it's a good idea to start working when I have no car, as there's not many places to apply within walking distance, and the job I ended up getting is a one and a half hour walk from my house. My mom told me that she'll be happy to drive me to work until school starts back, and they both said I'd have a car before college. So I started working. 
Now I'm working with no car, and have to rely on my mom taking me when she wants to, and using Lyft when she can't take me, which costs nearly 2 hours of my pay for one ride. The other issue is that now my parents are saying they don't think they'll find a car by the time I start college.

They had seen each other before, the first time they had dinner, ice cream and walked in the mall, Ryan even took her home, it was nice and apparently friendly. However, once in facetime she told me Ryan was being annoying and kept insisting on going out with her.

I got a bit jealous, because as a woman, even if i’m a lesbian, I KNOW why men insist, and it’s not always friendly. 

One day, she says she’s going to the movies with a friend, when confronted about said friend she tells me its Ryan. By that time I already felt jealous enough, but told her we could talk when she gets home. I actually called her and it was fine, I was still a bit jealous but she told me they were just friends, that she told him she wasn’t single and didn’t want to have an issue, just wanted to make music with her.

Mind you, this was on july 2023, and even after a month passed by, I still told her I don’t thing it’s ok to go out with people that are insisting, less when she first recognized it was weird, so you know the intentions of someone else but you go out with him still? 

On december 2023 she tells me he did actually confessed his feelings for her, I got a bit mad because Im not sure what would be the reason to avoid telling me this, it’s weird. She says she couldn’t care less about it because she’s not interested, so she forgot about it. This changed the narrative for me a bit, because apparently she rejected him first and then he confessed his feelings, this means he kept trying to push in the chances of convincing her, no? Why would she avoid that detail and tell me he wasn’t really flirting and just friendly?

Another thing, they have many friends in common, and apparently one of these guys heard Ryan and a friend talk about her, and when they asked her about my gf he said “I tried”.

It’s been a year already, and tbh, the topic didn’t stop coming up, not every month, but I was insecure and confused because it wasn’t adding up to me, maybe it’s my trust issues, but I wouldn’t go out or be friendly with a girl that knows Im not single and keeps trying to take me out.

However, I brought up the topic again recently in chances of maybe setting a boundary, because I do not feel comfortable with the idea of them talking or doing stuff together. I would never accuse her of doing something awful, but I have to accept that it makes me anxious to only think about this.

She then sends me a big paragraph and adds extra details I had no idea of before, apparently she did reject him telling him she wasn’t single nor interested in men, and wanted to be friends, and he said it was ok. 

Am I still the asshole for not wanting them to have contact?",TL;DR,2024-08-12,"AITA for not wanting my gf (f21) to talk to a guy (m21) that likes her? My long distance gf (F21) and me (F21) have been together for a year now, before we made it official, we had an issue about a “friend” (let’s call him Ryan) of hers.

They had seen each other before, the first time they had dinner, ice cream and walked in the mall, Ryan even took her home, it was nice and apparently friendly. However, once in facetime she told me Ryan was being annoying and kept insisting on going out with her.

I got a bit jealous, because as a woman, even if i’m a lesbian, I KNOW why men insist, and it’s not always friendly. 

One day, she says she’s going to the movies with a friend, when confronted about said friend she tells me its Ryan. By that time I already felt jealous enough, but told her we could talk when she gets home. I actually called her and it was fine, I was still a bit jealous but she told me they were just friends, that she told him she wasn’t single and didn’t want to have an issue, just wanted to make music with her.

Same custom manufacturing business but 1 is retail and the other is wholesale/b2b. I've worked out of the wholesale building for 8 years, I do everything from first contact with customer to sending the job out the door, and I'm technically the supervisor here but we've gradually trimmed roles as business has slowed down so that it's just me and a part-timer left as we prepare to close this side of things. We stopped taking orders start of last week and I've been told I'm being pulled over to the other building, which before anyone says I'm being used/lied to based on what follows in this post, I don't doubt them.

My issue is that early last week they had me start clearing out materials that I regularly clear out or delegate to be cleared out per my normal job responsibilities. Then it was, hey, collect up old invoices for shredding. Then a 2nd dumpster showed up and they've basically got me tearing apart their building now without a clear conversation about that expectation at all.

68,1eqhxae,AITA for not budging on my wedding colour scheme.,"First time Reddit post, long time Reddit lurker. Made a fresh new account just to post this.

So my fiancé(F34) and I(m27) have been dating for almost 5 years and have been engaged for about 9 months, we’ve recently started discussing about planning the wedding, I’ll be honest she’s doing a great job in planning it out, setting the budget, arranging venue viewings, etc. She is doing the majority of the planning herself and as it’s her big day I’m just letting her choose what she wants. 

We’ve recently gotten to the stage where we have to talk about colour schemes for my suit accessories and the bridesmaids dresses. My favourite colour is Cadbury Purple, it always has been. So I said I want that, at first she just said “okay” and we moved on. It then got to the point where she was suggesting different types of colours we could have, “lilac, peach, sage green, baby blue”. I said “I already told you I want Cadbury purple”. She said that I can’t have Cadbury purple because it doesn’t go with anything. I said im fine with her picking and choosing everything to do with the wedding but the only input I want to add is what I will be wearing.

She started to get into a strop, saying that I’m making it difficult and asking if we can just compromise and I said that it wouldn’t be compromising if it’s not the colour I want. I said if I don’t have Cadbury purple then I don’t care what colour I have and she should just pick it herself and not pretend that I have a say in the wedding when I clearly don’t.

So am I the asshole for wanting to stick to the only input I want to have in our wedding. 

EDIT:

I am not wanting a full purple suit as most people are imagining, even though I do like the joker I don’t want to be cosplaying him on my wedding day. 
The idea I had was very simple, plain black trousers, white shirt, purple tie and a white blazer.

For extra context the main reason my fiancé isn’t keen on the colour is because it doesn’t go with the aesthetics of our venue, it’s a beautiful modern rustic barn with fairy lights and bright atmosphere, she believes that the colour I chose will contrast too much in what she envisioned.

To the people saying that because we can’t pick a colour we shouldn’t get married, we’re not going to let a colour scheme end our relationship. 

I understand that my taste may not be the best. I’ve never been one to care about how I look and I don’t really wear anything special other then football tops and joggers, but I do like my idea of what I want to wear and I don’t think it’s too outlandish and if you do then, hey your entitled to your opinion on that.

I also don’t know if I explained it too well, with the planning itself we are very very early stages, we’ve not even set a date yet. All the work which has been done so far is budget, a few venue viewings, guest list(which I did have an input in) and starting to pick a colour scheme. Just for those who were berating me in the comments saying that she has done all this work by herself, and I’m making it harder for her. the work hasn’t begun yet. I’ve told her if she wants my input on anything I’ll help but I don’t want to get in her way of having the wedding she wants.

69,1eqhx6d,AITA for not picking up my former foster daughter in the middle of the night after she called for help?,"Two years ago my wife (37f) and I (39) decided to foster. We have 3 children and felt terrible that there were kids out in the world that needed a loving home.
 Our first two placements only lasted a few days. It was fine. But then we were place with “Olivia”(11)I won’t go into personal details but we were her 5th foster home since she was 9. My wife and I literally tried everything to help but she was rebellious. She ran away, broke things, stole things and lied. She lied so much it was insane. It was months and months of this. Just when we thought things were getting better she would ruin it. The 6th time she ran away we had enough. 
We asked to have her removed. She said “I knew you didn’t care! I knew you didn’t want me! You just wanted the money !” My wife and I lost it. We reminded her how we listened to her, took her places she wanted to go, and encouraged her. We told that we didn’t spend a dime of the foster care money instead we saved it for her so she could have money when she turned 18. We showed her the bank account with thousands of dollars in it and said that when she’s 18 she can still have it. 
I think, it was at that point she realized we cared but it was too late.
She went back into the system and not sure what happened. Life went on. We had another baby, we moved a few miles away. Last Saturday night my wife received a call from Olivia (now 13). She put in on speaker phone. Olivia apparently ran away from another foster home and had been living on the streets for days. Eventually she made it to our old neighborhood. I told her that we moved. She asked us if we could pick her up from a certain location. She asked if we could take her in. She was crying saying she loved the kids. She missed my wife’s cooking. She wants me to teach her how to play piano(I had started teaching her as a way to bond). I felt bad for her but taking her back was impossible. But we feared she would run away again. So we told her that we would be there. We called the police instead and they took her in. 
The police contacted us a few days later saying Olivia’s foster parents were pressing charges. She stole a few things. Also Olivia had a vape with drugs in it. We were told that she would probably go to juvenile detention until she’s 18(this is what we were told, unsure if it will happen). They asked if we wanted any updates and we declined. We also asked them not to have her contact us again. Today we were telling some friends about this. While some agreed with us a few called us monsters.
 One of our friends said “I would’ve scooped that baby up and kept her”. Legally there was nothing we could do.

70,1eqhfsj,AITA for posting a rant about my Manager on my Snapchat story ,"So I wrote on my Snapchat story about how my Manager reprimanded me for texting my bedridden mother, who has lupus, and how he and a another bartender did nothing while I and another bartender were forced to run everything for nearly two hours.
The only other people there on that day were the bartenders from the morning, so it was me, a
53-year-old woman, and my lead manager's best friend, who's a bartender there, as well as the head lead and then the other lead who came to replace him for the day.
Now, while I didn't mention anyone by name but it was pretty obvious who it was about and yeah I get it wasn't the most mature thing to do. But this head lead gets bitched about everyday by everyone else for being a hard ass the other lead today immediately start to complain about him and make fun of him after he left for her schedule.
When he asked to pull me away and talk again, I swear, I thought he was going to call me out for not being at the front again, so I thought I was texting a lot again or something. So, I like started to explain how I was trying to finish the Morning side-work since our second manager would be arriving soon. And he suddenly stopped dead in his tracks and went no cmon Nicole and started to ask me why he had to find out from someone showing him my story that I said he was reprimanding me when my mom was sick on my story instead of talking to him.
He just kept going on about how hard he tries to be nice and chill with me and how he didn't know my mom was sick, so it's not like he was trying to be a jerk, and if I had an issue with him, I should ve told him to his face.
I even apologized if he was offended when I told him that I wasn't talking trash and that it just was me venting about my manager, like most people do. I also acknowledged that I need listen to them about using my phone, whether I like it or not.
But he just kept babbling about how he's always so nice to me and how when I go behind his back instead of telling him to his face, he feels like I'm talking shit about him, and he tries so hard to be nice and chill to me that I owe it to tell him to his face when I have an issue with him. And then when I walked away, he waited for me to be out of sight, but he didn't see that ! had looped around to use the bathroom, and then I saw him bring his bestie and the other manager to the tap house at the same time, and clearly they were talking about the situation because he didn't even wait a full minute before calling them over.

So, here’s the situation. I (Samuel) have been working at our company for several years, and during that time, I became quite close with a colleague (Grace) who was in global mobility for 5 years. We worked on numerous projects together, and I always valued her insights and contributions. We even had a few late-night brainstorming sessions that felt more like friendly hangouts than work. I really enjoyed her humor and company, which made our collaboration even more enjoyable. We were *samesies*.

Our company announced a spin-off, creating a new organization. To my surprise, Grace decided to join this new entity as a senior process designer. I can’t help but feel a bit betrayed by her decision. We had a great relationship and I thought we were on the same page about our future at the company.

What really stings is that she didn’t even give me a heads-up. I found out through the company-wide email. It felt like a slap in the face. We used to talk about our career goals and aspirations, and she never mentioned wanting to leave. I can’t help but wonder if she was planning this all along and just kept me in the dark.

Since finding out, I’ve been so upset that I’ve started ignoring her chats. When I saw her in the cafeteria, I turned my head and pretended not to see her. She noticed and got upset, asking me why I was acting this way. I told her that I felt she should’ve told me about her plans to leave the company. We were supposed to grow together. She said it was a personal decision and that she didn’t owe anyone an explanation.

72,1eqgfdj,AITA for not returning a microwave,"I’m preparing for college and it’s expensive. My credit card is almost to the limit ($1,500) and one of those purchases includes a microwave. I saw one that I really liked and knew it would last a long time, even after college. The sign said $70, but it was actually $80 at the register. I still proceeded to check out because I was not explicitly told no. 

My mom later made a big deal on how I shouldn’t need a microwave that expensive and a 700 watt $50 one would be fine. The one I have is 1000 watt and can actually fit a plate. My dad insisted that I get a microwave I like and that I might as well keep it because it’ll be able to cook actual meals in it. I also believe he just wants to treat me because I’m his daughter and I’m going to a really nice college. My mom insists tho that i return it because we aren’t rich and she’s the one paying for it. I felt bad the next day and asked my dad to return it but he said no since we spend so much more money on other things. That is true, as my mom insisted that I buy other things such as shoes, clothes, etc that were probably up to $200 on the card. 

I’m afraid she’s going to get upset when she comes home to find the microwave and refuse to pay off the card, and I won’t be getting a job till after the payment is due. I also fear that she’ll refuse to help me move in and I’ll have to leave without saying goodbye. She hasn’t yelled at me or anything, which I think it’s because she saw me crying yesterday about how much money i had to spend (which at this point $30 sounds so trivial and i would give her cash just to make it up). But i know inside she is probably upset.

My credit card is almost to the limit ($1,500) and one of those purchases includes a microwave. I saw one that I really liked and knew it would last a long time, even after college. The sign said $70, but it was actually $80 at the register. I still proceeded to check out because I was not explicitly told no. 

My mom later made a big deal on how I shouldn’t need a microwave that expensive and a 700 watt $50 one would be fine. The one I have is 1000 watt and can actually fit a plate. My dad insisted that I get a microwave I like and that I might as well keep it because it’ll be able to cook actual meals in it. I also believe he just wants to treat me because I’m his daughter and I’m going to a really nice college. My mom insists tho that i return it because we aren’t rich and she’s the one paying for it. I felt bad the next day and asked my dad to return it but he said no since we spend so much more money on other things. That is true, as my mom insisted that I buy other things such as shoes, clothes, etc that were probably up to $200 on the card. 

I’m afraid she’s going to get upset when she comes home to find the microwave and refuse to pay off the card, and I won’t be getting a job till after the payment is due. I also fear that she’ll refuse to help me move in and I’ll have to leave without saying goodbye. She hasn’t yelled at me or anything, which I think it’s because she saw me crying yesterday about how much money i had to spend (which at this point $30 sounds so trivial and i would give her cash just to make it up). But i know inside she is probably upset.

73,1eqg934,AITA for complaining to some campers about noise,"Ok hear me out. I went camping this past weekend at a state park campsite.

The second night we were there, a huge family (4 adults, 6ish kids idk exactly how many) set up in the site right next to ours. They were constantly yelling to each other and the kids were running around and playing loudly. Not a huge deal, kind of annoying but in a totally reasonable way.

At some point (around 6/7pm or so) they started playing music. It started as reasonable volume country music but quickly became super loud house music. 

After about 10 or so mins of this I went over to them and asked them to turn it down. I was pretty polite about it, I’m not huge on conflict and I don’t like the idea of sleeping next to people who have it out for me. They turned it down for about 10 mins then it was back at the same volume as before, if not louder. I should also mention that these people were playing this on YouTube. With ads.

At this point I wanted to call the ranger but my boyfriend (who’s even more conflict averse than me) asked me not to, saying they would know it was us who called and it wasn’t quiet hours yet so they weren’t breaking any rules. I did talk (pretty loudly) about how annoying the music was and every time it would turn off (anytime the guy got a phone call) I would make a comment about how nice it was to not have music.

Around 8:30pm or so they turned on a song at the loudest volume yet and I (unintentionally, it really just slipped out) yelled “that is SO LOUD.” Around that time they shut the music off and the kids started going to bed.

The next morning, at around 9:30am they started playing music again.

I immediately turned to my boyfriend and said, “Oh my god, I have to say something. I can’t listen to that anymore. It is so rude!”

One of the women in the other campsite heard me and yelled back something along the lines of, “chill out, we’re just having fun! We’re camping!”

I said, “So are we!”

She said, “we’re hanging out having a good time, we don’t want to sit in silence.”

I laughed and said, “silence? It has NOT been silent.”

She didn’t say anything back to me and soon after they turned the music off. We left around 11am. 

I told this story to my friends expecting them to back me up and help me feel vindicated about how awful this family was, but a few of them started defending the family, saying they were on vacation and trying to hang out.

76,1eqes3b,AITA for being sensitive?,"Hello Reddit. I came here to ask for a second opinion about something that has recently happened and I apologise if my english isn't good as it is my second language.

I (21F) am the middle child of 5 siblings. Today, my older sisters came over (28F) and (30F) as i live with my parents along with my younger siblings. The night was going well and we were all laughing as jokes were being passed around and sibling banter is usually the norm in our family. However, my sister, the 26 year old - we can call her leaf -  made a joke about my stutter which I am insecure about along with my voice and body as a whole. Reactively, I shut down and started to just look at my phone to avoid social contact. I was confronted with my sister after a bit and she asked me what was wrong.

This part was my fault here - and i became passive aggressive and asked her if she would apologise for making fun of my stutter. She bacame silent for a bit before saying no and then told me how this has happened before and told me she can't read my mind, which was true. For some reason, I started crying at being overwhelmed with emotions from these feelings from the past.

For some context, I have been confronted by leaf before for the same reason, last year. It was the first time I have been confronted about my sensitivity to things and i understood where this was coming from. I don't make fun of people appearance's, espicially my loved ones if i know they're insecure about it so I would get emotional when people wouldn't do the same for me.

It had been a while since that last confrontation happened and hadn't had emotional outbursts since then but leaf had brought up the fact that she was sick of this happening again and how I can't keep doing this. She told me that making fun of my teeth, face, body are things she wouldn't know unless i told her and i was told to say something now. I said nothing as It is a reflex for me to be quiet when i am upset and just said she just listed the things, including my voice. I left the room after I was excused and just cried on my bed for just being mad at myself.

After a few hours, I've had some time to think and I felt extremely guilty for ruining the mood. I feel as if i have regressed to when I was snarky and would make people feel as if they are walking eggshells around me. I feel so bad for my sister because she said if this were to happen again - she would never joke around me or anything anymore because she can't predict what I'll do.

Right now - I need advice. Please reddit, help me fix my relationship with my sister.

She did not know my stutter was an insecurity until now.

For some context, I own a small house that I bought a few years ago. Jess and I are pretty close, and she’s stayed over at my place a bunch of times when she’s needed to be in the city for work or just to hang out. Jess has been dating ""Tom"" (28M) for about a year. I’ve met him several times, and he’s a decent guy. We’ve had some good conversations, and he seems to treat Jess well. We get along fine, but we’re not exactly buddies.

A couple of weeks ago, I mentioned to Jess that I’d be going out of town for work for about a week. She asked if she and Tom could stay at my place during that time because their apartment is undergoing some renovations, and they needed somewhere to stay for a few days. I wasn’t sure how to respond at first and told her I’d think about it.

The thing is, while I trust Jess completely, I’m not entirely comfortable with Tom staying in my house when I’m not there. It’s not that I don’t trust him exactly—it’s more that I just don’t know him that well. I’m pretty private, and the idea of someone other than my sister having access to my place when I’m not around just didn’t sit right with me. I have some personal items and stuff that I’m protective of, and it just felt a little too intrusive.

After thinking it over, I told Jess that I wasn’t comfortable with them staying at my place. I offered to help them find another place to stay or chip in for a hotel or Airbnb. Jess seemed a little disappointed, but she said she understood and that they’d figure something out. She didn’t make a big deal out of it, and I thought everything was cool.

But since then, Jess has been a bit distant. She’s not avoiding me, but our conversations have been a little off. When I asked her if everything was okay, she said she was just busy, but I can’t shake the feeling that she’s upset. I’ve also heard through our mom that Jess was a little hurt but didn’t want to cause any drama. No one’s directly told me I was wrong, but now I’m starting to wonder if I was being too protective or if I should have just trusted them more.

80,1eqe4gm,WIBTA for telling my friend she needs a therapist?,"I’d probably start this off by saying that I, whether right or wrong, would consider myself a good friend. If you’re sick, if you’re heartbroken, if you’re short on money, I’ll be there in a heartbeat. My friends tell me I’m a good friend (including the friend I’m talking about) so this situation is kind of breaking my brain.

My friend is going through a rough time, and has been for a while. They’re depressed that they can’t find a partner and it’s really really getting them down. I’ve done the whole wingwoman bit and setting them up and even helping tinder swipe, but it has generally come to nothing. Either they’re not interested or the prospective partner isn’t interested in them. This has been going on a long long time.

They go through highs and lows but when there’s a low, it’s really low. They’re mean and snappy to me and our other friends, and bitchy about people, and deeply and darkly negative.

I’ve had a pretty traumatic and tumultuous life, which has resulted in my own pretty extreme mental health issues that this friend has helped me through, and I still struggle pretty deeply with them internally to this day though I don’t tend to show it on the surface anymore. I’m medicated and have a therapist to help me get by, without those things I’d be dead.

I say all this to highlight that I am myself on a journey of trying to deal with trauma and depression and trying every day to be a little happier and not fall off “the cliff”. Amidst this, my friend will regularly unload on me about how depressed they are and how terrible life is and how they’re going to die alone and no one wants to spend time with them. I listen and help to the best of my abilities, but although I would never tell them, it destroys my entire day mental health wise talking to them for hours on end, or watching them be rude and cold towards me or other people. I’ll start off the day ready to be positive and by midday I just want to crawl into a hole.

This friend is medicated and used to have a therapist but decided the therapy was too expensive and stopped going. I know her financial situation is comfortable, and although she may not want to spend that money, it is available to her. So basically, WIBTA for telling my friend that even if she has to cut back in other areas of life, she needs to find the money for a therapist because I’m just not mentally equipped to be hers?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-12,"WIBTA for telling my friend she needs a therapist? I’d probably start this off by saying that I, whether right or wrong, would consider myself a good friend. If you’re sick, if you’re heartbroken, if you’re short on money, I’ll be there in a heartbeat. My friends tell me I’m a good friend (including the friend I’m talking about) so this situation is kind of breaking my brain.

My friend is going through a rough time, and has been for a while. They’re depressed that they can’t find a partner and it’s really really getting them down. I’ve done the whole wingwoman bit and setting them up and even helping tinder swipe, but it has generally come to nothing. Either they’re not interested or the prospective partner isn’t interested in them. This has been going on a long long time.

They go through highs and lows but when there’s a low, it’s really low. They’re mean and snappy to me and our other friends, and bitchy about people, and deeply and darkly negative.

I’ve had a pretty traumatic and tumultuous life, which has resulted in my own pretty extreme mental health issues that this friend has helped me through, and I still struggle pretty deeply with them internally to this day though I don’t tend to show it on the surface anymore.

81,1eqe2st,AITA for telling my parents not to speak to me after possibly stealing my medication?,"Feeling quite conflicted here. I (30F) was prescribed an anti anxiety medication recently after dealing with some life-altering events. I only take it when absolutely necessary and have no prior history of substance use/abuse. My husband (29M) is aware of everything and has been very supportive during this time. 

So, last month I was scheduled to have a pretty major surgery in a city 3 hours from where I live. My parents live closer to the hospital so my husband and I stayed with them the night before the surgery. I mentioned taking this medication to calm my anxiety before my surgery the next day to my mom and she had an absolute meltdown about it, begging me to throw it out and never take it again. She brought it up several times that night and into the morning. She came to the hospital with my husband and was questioning him about the prescription and if I took it that morning. Post surgery we stopped at my parents, ate dinner, took our suitcases and went home. I didn’t think anything of it. 

Well fast forward to a few days ago, I realized I haven’t seen my prescription in a while. I went in my suitcase that I haven’t used since my surgery and found the pill bottle sealed closed with no pills in it. There were originally still 13 pills (out of 15) in the bottle before they went missing. I’ve searched everywhere and cannot find them. The only explanation I can think of is that either my mom took them at some point, or had my dad go through my stuff and take them while I was in surgery. They keep denying it and pointing the finger at my husband or that I just lost them. But the bottle was closed in my suitcase with no pills inside. I also realized my mom wouldn’t let it go before my surgery, but hasn’t brought up the prescription issue since. 

My parents are not good at respecting boundaries and never take accountability for their wrong doings. I’ve been questioning them over the past few days but they will not admit it. Even my sisters called me to tell me my parents definitely took it and are lying. Today I told them that I will not speak to them until they admit they took my medication and understand they really crossed the line. My mom told me I’m an asshole and will regret blaming them for it. So Reddit, am I the asshole for telling my parents not to speak to me until they admit it?

82,1eqdzbo,AITA for getting angry and blaming my mum after my diagnosis.,"For context: I 21f have always had mild health concerns from the age of 13 I’d say. I’ve had really bad breathing issues, back pain, joint pain, rashes on my face etc. From the ages of 16-21 I was at hospitals constantly getting checkups because no one had any idea what was wrong with me. Anyway. 
Last year I visited my home country and I got really sick with a chest infection. I was literally suffocating with chest pain and my back hurt so bad that I had to go to emergency for having symptoms of a heart attack. They treated me at the hospital and 2 days later sent me to do 2 blood tests. I’m not exactly sure what they were for but one was a general blood test that checks if u have any low vitamins or it checks glucose levels etc and the other was an autoimmune disease test. The general test came back perfect I literally had no issues (despite my family constantly commenting on my lifestyle bc I don’t eat meat and other certain foods) 
The autoimmune test only flags up if your pathogens are very obvious so mine were negative but one flagged up because I had a high level of a specific protein in my body that indicated an abnormal inflammation. 
My aunt has lupus and arthritis so she took me to a specialist she knows for about 20 years now. This lady writes me a note to give to the clinic for 4 more blood tests one checking for lupus, the other for arthritis and the last 2 checking for thyroid issues. She also tells me to take my top off because she wants to look at my back. 
IMMEDIATELY she tells me I have scoliosis… and she sends me to get an xray done which confirms it…
I did the blood tests and confirmed I have ‘mild’  lupus as well… so my breathing issues were from my spine not allowing room for my lungs to expand and my other symptoms were from my lupus… I can’t do anything for my back anymore because I’m too old, besides physiotherapy and I take medication for my lupus 

I was angry with my mum because ever since I was a kid she would shout at me to straighten my back, my legs, and people asked her as well like what was wrong with my back or my skin etc and she would always say I was doing it on purpose or it wasn’t serious… so AITA for blaming her and getting angry after my diagnosis because I felt like she had so much time to help me and she rather spent it scolding me.

Fast forward to two years ago where I basically stop any more changes and was a lot more confident in my body, I met my boyfriend(32m) he was great.

I never intended to hide my natural face/body from him but I hated the old me and just try to hide it from everyone if I could.

At first he didn’t know it was me and thought it was my sister that I’m not really friendly with. She stayed natural so she really resembles the old me and has heavily criticised my life choices. He made some real hurtful jabs at those photos and when my mother pointed out it was me, he thought it was a joke. When he realised it wasn’t his face sunk and was quiet through the rest of the day.

On the way back home was when he lashed out and ask me why I hid this from him and that if I had such extensive procedures done, I should have told him before getting with him. He said he felt that he was lied to and accused me of a manipulator.

I've been in the ER multiple times over the last 3 weeks, my doctor's have forbidden me from lifting anything over 10 pounds, and I'm under orders to rest frequently. In short, any kind of activity, even just walking to the car, and I'm out of breath and I start getting dizzy. Resting between tasks isn't just recommended, it's required.

That being said, my wife (51F) and I have custody of our 5 year old granddaughter. And she is a handful. Because of her mother's treatment of her, she has behavioral issues out the wazoo and has to be supervised pretty much 24/7. Leaving her alone for a few minutes to go to the bathroom is problematic because she instantly gets into things she's not supposed to.

The other day, my wife wanted to get a shower. Completely understandable. But I was trying to get a painting hung up and looking for the things I needed. Hunt down the drill; have to rest. Find the screws, level, etc.; gotta rest. Climb a small ladder to mark where I want to hang it; Yup. Have to rest then too. Each time I rested (usually in my home office at my computer), my wife would walk by making huffing noises like she was pissed about something. Keep in mind that I'm sitting there sucking in air and trying to calm my heartrate down.

When I finally finished (and rested again), I went and asked her what the problem was. She proceeded to yell at me that she wanted to get a shower and now, because I was ""sitting at my computer"", it was too late (FYI, it was only 1pm).

My friend is embarrassed nonetheless when we have to take him into shops or restaurants, though I make sure we only take him places where I know he’ll be accepted. I do understand and share her embarrassment, which I’m sure adds to my community’s perception of Yanks being eccentric! However, in the country it takes forever to drive anywhere and it’s not fair to him to leave him alone all day or for extended periods of time. He’s used to being with me all it most of the time and experiences terrible distress when left behind. 

My friend feels annoyed that, after we both raised two kids each who are now adults, we still have to drag around a creature who, for all intents and purposes, is a toddler requiring attention and who imbues most experiences with mild-to-significant hassle. I agree but again, we don’t really have any options for his care if we don’t take him. 

She wants me to make sure to add that he also tends to whine for attention, further embarrassing us. I fully agree with her that it’s not ideal, but we have to just roll with it.

Let me add that we do leave him behind to go to dinner or lunch and sometimes even just for an afternoon out, so it’s not as if I’m insisting on bringing him everywhere all the time. Also, she objects to me carrying him on my hip like a baby into places where we are told dogs aren’t allowed. 

It’s worth noting that she says that I am NTA, HE is 🤣 Seriously, she doesn’t hate the dog , her problem is the embarrassment of getting stared at or annoyed looks etc. I think it’s worth the discomfort to have him with us.

Before I start, I want to say I haven’t said ANYTHING to said friend about his behavior, only tried to give advice where I can. I’ve been debating with myself over this issue for a while because it’s starting to make me not want to be around him, but I don’t want to just cut ties without trying to amend the issue first, hence coming here for advice. 

I (25f) have a friend/coworker (31m) who for the sake of this post I’ll call Beavis. Beavis and I have been friends since he started working with me, a little over a year ago, and is also friends with my brother (also works with us) and other friends at work. Beavis constantly bums off of everyone he can at work because he gives all his money to his baby mama/partner (I’m pretty sure they’re still together but not 100%) and never makes ANY effort to pay anyone back for it, but almost daily complains about having to bum off of others. Don’t get me wrong, I have absolutely no issue with helping out a friend…. Until I feel like they’re just taking advantage of me. Beavis and his partner/baby mama/whatever the fuck she is to him have fought like cats and dogs every day as long as I’ve known him, she’s attacked me twice and accused me of cheating with him (despite having literally no evidence to prove so), and has been cheating on him herself for a while now. Because of this and other issues (not my business to tell so I won’t) he’s been staying at his Dad’s instead of the apartment they share. Every single conversation I have with Beavis it seems turns to him complaining or looking for pity over one thing or another, to the point he will rub his “woe is me look how much my life sucks” in your face as if you can’t possibly have it anywhere near as bad as him and that you shouldn’t complain even if you do. An example of this is we were discussing our home lives with another coworker in our friend group, and he was complaining and rubbing in our faces that he has to sleep in the garage, to the point he was shoving a picture of inside said garage in our faces essentially. Don’t get me wrong, I try to be supportive and helpful any time a friend is in a bad spot, but honestly it feels like he’s trying to throw a pity party for himself. Even if the conversation is about something completely unrelated he’ll find a way to flip it back to “poor me my life sucks” yet he doesn’t show any initiative in changing it. He cusses and gets loud and calls his partner names every time he rants about her, yet refuses to leave. It’s so infuriating and exhausting honestly, but I haven’t spoken up to him about it because I don’t want to cause drama or tension in the friend group. I do truly care about him and want to be his friend but I can’t deal with his behavior anymore. AITA? How should I handle this? I’m autistic and I’m worried that if I do try to speak up that I’ll come off as heartless or like a bitch, when honestly I’m just tired of this “boohoo my life sucks but I refuse to try to do anything to fix it” behavior from him.

Even if the conversation is about something completely unrelated he’ll find a way to flip it back to “poor me my life sucks” yet he doesn’t show any initiative in changing it. He cusses and gets loud and calls his partner names every time he rants about her, yet refuses to leave. It’s so infuriating and exhausting honestly, but I haven’t spoken up to him about it because I don’t want to cause drama or tension in the friend group. I do truly care about him and want to be his friend but I can’t deal with his behavior anymore. AITA? How should I handle this? I’m autistic and I’m worried that if I do try to speak up that I’ll come off as heartless or like a bitch, when honestly I’m just tired of this “boohoo my life sucks but I refuse to try to do anything to fix it” behavior from him.

88,1eqcoy6,AITA for not leaving my seat on the metro for another person?,"Okay, so a bit of backstory. I (21m) was on a vacation to southern India, and had the incredible luck to fracture my leg. As a result, standing was rather painful and I was looking forward to a trip to the beach. Because why not.

So I bought a metro ticket to the beach and got on it the next morning. There was no one in the car at the start, but it soon filled up to the point that like 10 people were already standing up.

As the doors are about to close, a group of 5-6 girls gets on the train and immediately looks around for a place to sit. At some point, as the metro starts moving, they ask me to move from my seat. 

Now, one thing you should know about Indian Metros is that they have at least 5 compartments for women only. This is to protect the women and allow them extra seating room.

So I look through the glass partition into the ladies' compartment next to us and it's practically empty.

I explain to the women that I fractured my leg and I have trouble standing for long durations, but they can always move to the women's compartment at the next stop.

Most of them just say ok, but one of them freaks. She points at a sign that shows a woman sitting on a seat and tells me to follow the rules or she will call the station guards at the next stop. I calmly explain that the graphic shows a pregnant woman.

So the woman stalks away (and tries to shut down my laptop while she's at it). As we stop, she goes to the station guards but as it's my stop I just get up and leave. 

I consider myself being in the right for being polite through the entire scene, but when I get home and recount it to my parents and some of my friends, they tell me I wasn't being accomadating for the women who tried to take my seat.

91,1eqcew0,AITA For accidentally knocking the birthday cake at a party? (25F),"A friend invited me as a plus one to her friend’s birthday party, she was turning 25 and this party was supposed to be huge. I used to be close with the birthday girl because we’re all different levels of influencer on instagram, but they stopped inviting me to their events, I suspect it’s because I gained some weight recently, and started talking about body positivity. 

Anyway, so after a couple awkward hours of the party I kept looking to the dessert table that was set up, but covered because it wasn’t time for dessert yet, but I wanted to have a quick brownie so I squeezed passed to tables to get to them, put a few on my plate, and on my way out when I squeezed passed a couple other dessert tables my hip brushed the cake knocking it over. 

All blame fell on me for “not being able to control myself” which I don’t think was very fair. I saw a couple other girls sneak a couple brownies so I figured it was ok. The host made a comment about how if I wasn’t so big I wouldn’t have knocked it down and I accidentally slipped my tongue and said the tables were too close together, so everyone thinks now I was trying to blame her. They were able to go out and get another cake which I offered to pay for, but didn’t even get to.

There was only one free sales assistant and I could tell she didn't want me to approach her as she was intentionally avoiding eye contact and walking away when I was close. I waited 10 minutes in the hopes that another sales assistant would be free but they weren't and it was getting late so I approached the original sales assistant. She pretty much brushed me off without helping me so I went back to browsing on my own as my husband was going to meet me there. When my husband arrived her entire demeanour changed and she suddenly wanted to do her job. 

I was looking at a bag that I would've bought for myself if it wasn't for the rude sales assistant. My husband asked me if I wanted to get it but I said no as the rude sales assistant would've been the one to benefit from the commission as by this point she had come over and was offering to help us.

A few days later my husband surprised me with the exact same bag. I asked him if he got it from the same place and if it was the same sales assistant who had helped him. It was, so I told him I wanted to return it. He knows she was rude and dismissive when I tried to ask her for help but he still didn't want me to return the bag as he said I would be missing out because of a random stranger. To him the commission isn't a big deal but I don't think she should benefit after how rude she was. If he had bought the bag with a different sales assistant I would've kept it but since he didn't, I returned it. Now he's upset because I returned his gift.

I genuinely have never experienced such culture shock and disgust in my life. And it’s not the first time visiting them, not at all, which is why the sudden culture shock is well.. shocking. I visit them almost yearly. Here is a short list of things that they do that just makes me not want to interact with them at all- blocking all sources of water, leaving huge pools in sinks, floors, etc, unplugging EVERY electronic device, I’m not kidding, they turn off WiFi, microwaves, cables, etc, it’s insane. They say it will all blow up. My mother and me have tried to explain NUMEROUS times that it won’t, they just won’t listen. No ac- there is ac in the apartment where we are staying but they refuse to turn anything on, and say if it is on, it can’t go below 26 celcius or it will catch on fire??? This especially bothers me because where i am in China it is consistently over 40 degrees celcius and i hate being hot. - sanitary standards. Everything is filthy.

Absolute no social awareness, forcing me to eat when im not hungry, intruding at 1 am waking us up to “make sure that everything is clean”, and guilt tripping me and my mother when we don’t want to spend time at home, and go out.

Two days ago my husband asked if his friend and his girlfriend could come over, my boys were asleep and I haven’t had much time with people outside of them for awhile (context my boys are 2 and 9 months) so I decided sure let’s see what happens.

More context I’ve met this girl before they’ve briefly dated a few times she cheated on him they broke up it’s become a cycle with them. I did not have the best impression of her the first time around so I went into this pretty guarded.

Given her request of her boyfriend not bothering her this rubbed me the wrong way because he was doing what she had asked him to do, I know this because he was playing games with my husband and she complained about being ignored by him.

96,1eqb03m,AITA for leaving when my parents weren't home?,"I am 32 years old male, living abroad with my fiancée, 500 km away from home. I have an older sister, who is married and has a 3 years old girl. I was a normal kid, never had any serious problems. I had good study results, I became an engineer. I earn enough to have a decent life. My problem is, that I want to have a normal relationship with my parents, and they make it very hard. 

As a child, I hardly got any emotional support, when I told them my problem, they usually saw it as a burden, as an extra task, they behaved as victims, that they don't have extra energy to listen to this, and I make them look bad, that I have such problems. Meanwhile my sister was a problematic and rebellous teenager with bad study results, was always partying, drinking and smoking a lot, always arguing with my parents. So the weekends were usually very loud at home. That made me recognise, if I learn a lot and have good results, keep my problems to myself, my parents will leave me alone. Even if my sister tried to escape from the fights, saying to my parents that I am no better than her, so they should argue with me as well. 

My parents visited me only 3x during my studies at the university and afterwards, within 10 years. I have invited them many times though. I just wanted them to have some fun time, because they rarely left home for fun. They usually made some shitty excuses: It's too far (100 km), they are tired...
And now, that I have been living abroad, it's the same. My mom visited me only once, when she was tired on the road back from my sister. My sister lives also abroad, 1000 km away, and I am living kinda in between them. So, I invited my parents many times, my current city is in the mountains, they love hiking, but always just excuses. They visit my sister 2-3 times yearly for a week though. It's weird, because I visit them always when I am in my home country, and they seem normal. Still can't have deep, meaningful conversations with them. I keep having the feeling, that I am just a secondary part of the family. They call me, when they need some support with technical stuff. When I told them, that I find our relationship one sided, they just played the victim, told me I am silly. And yesterday, when I wanted to visit them with my fiancée and her mother, they just weren't home. I discussed my plans with my parents, even wrote 2 messages on the road, what time we are going to be there exactly. So, I called my mom, she told me, she will be home soon. We waited 30 minutes and left.

I feel embarrassed and disappointed. My parents didn't even contact me afterwards. I am just tired trying to get closer to them, and they just keep ignoring me, neglecting my feelings.

My sister lives also abroad, 1000 km away, and I am living kinda in between them. So, I invited my parents many times, my current city is in the mountains, they love hiking, but always just excuses. They visit my sister 2-3 times yearly for a week though. It's weird, because I visit them always when I am in my home country, and they seem normal. Still can't have deep, meaningful conversations with them. I keep having the feeling, that I am just a secondary part of the family. They call me, when they need some support with technical stuff. When I told them, that I find our relationship one sided, they just played the victim, told me I am silly. And yesterday, when I wanted to visit them with my fiancée and her mother, they just weren't home. I discussed my plans with my parents, even wrote 2 messages on the road, what time we are going to be there exactly. So, I called my mom, she told me, she will be home soon. We waited 30 minutes and left.

I feel embarrassed and disappointed. My parents didn't even contact me afterwards. I am just tired trying to get closer to them, and they just keep ignoring me, neglecting my feelings. I am fine on my own, I have got used to it, it's just a bit sad, and I don't want this shit in my life anymore. Am I the asshole?",0.0,0.0034966858,0,1

98,1eqao9f,AITA for insisting the birthday girl pays for her own party?,"
So, I (20M) recently went to Mary’s (20F) birthday party. I’m personally not close to her, but our whole circle got invited.

Now, I know Mary isn’t well-off. Her parents, both healthy and well-educated, live off the social system, so Mary herself is particularly stingy about money. She once tried to split the bill by counting the slices of fish we each had from a dish. So that’s why, when I got invited to go to the club (we are all students, so we aren’t really that rich for clubs), I specifically asked her whether we had to pay for anything. I’m fine with paying the entry fees or for my drinks, but I just needed to make sure. She assured me that we wouldn’t have to pay.

So, we went to the party, and food and drinks just started stacking up. There were also performances exclusively for our table. One of the female friends assured me that it was part of a package along with the entry fee, so I didn’t pay much attention to it. The whole night, it was basically Mary and her best friend really going hard on the drinks and food.

The end of the night came, and one of the club hosts came in with a ~2k bill. Mary said, “Okay, so there’s 15 of us here. Exclude me and (her best friend), and you all pay up for just the food! I covered the entry for you guys.” Mind you, we came in with gifts. My gift for her was at least twice the amount of an entry ticket.

I was too tired to try and debate with her or even question it, so I just paid for the drinks I had and left. Some of my friends decided to follow me.

Now, it’s been a few days, and after the first night of blowing up my phone and chasing me for money, they’ve now completely ignored me. Some of the girls now think that we were real jerks for leaving Mary and her friends with a 2k bill. I heard they didn’t have 2k to pay, so they had some trouble leaving the club. My girlfriend said I should have just loan it them since clubs are really dangerous for them to get in trouble with.

99,1eqa304,AITA my sister is trying to plan her gender reveal on my birthday ,"

I originally was not going to post to this sub because I did not feel like I was in the wrong but another family member is making me feel like I am. For context I (20F) live in an entirely different state from my family. I’ve been away from them for about 8 months and I’ve visited about 2 times. I am turning 21 in a month and I have birthday trip planned with my roommate. We were originally going to go to Disneyland and then meet up with my mom and sister in Las Vegas. The plans have changed since finding out that my sister (30F) was pregnant as she can’t fly. My mom is now flying my roommate and I home for my birthday. After I got the flights she told me to talk to my sister since she wanted to go to a restaurant we had been before. For MY birthday. Today I received a text message from my sister asking when I am going to be home so she can plan her gender reveal. I gave her my dates and she asks me what time I get in on my birthday. I ask if she is trying to plan her gender reveal on my birthday and she tells me it’s the only day that works for everyone. Everyone being 14+ people. I tell her that I will not be going if she decides to do that. She gets upset and asks me why. I put my foot down and told her no again, to which I receive one final message. “Are you sure bc that’s the only day of those 4 that works with everybody else’s schedule. Otherwise we’re going to do Saturday the 31st if you won’t go that Sunday.” “That sunday” is my birthday. She seems to see nothing wrong with the entire situation and I am really at a loss for words. Pls help me out here, Aitah?? 

Slight update to this post: Thank you to everyone in the comments for your feedback. To the positive comments, thank you for making me feel seen and heard. And to the negative comments, thank you for giving me a reality check. I have apologized to my sister and I am waiting for a response. I understand that some of you do not see the value in having a one day for me but I have had a really rocky past with birthdays. I won’t get too much into it but I just really wanted one last big birthday to celebrate with family and friends without having to share my spotlight. I understand that I come off self centered for that but unfortunately it’s just how I feel.

Edit: To clear something up my mom is aware of the situation, and she already asked my sister to have it on the 2nd instead. 

Most likely my last update: In my apology to my sister I mentioned to her how much having my birthday to myself meant to me. I also asked if there was anyway, she could do it on the second so that I would be able to attend and celebrate her day. (the second only conflicts with one other person.) I received no acknowledgment of my feelings, instead I got the following message “Don’t worry about it but it’s too late. We’ve already told 9 other people that it’s the 31st.” I also found out that she told my mom that she might not get an invitation to the gender reveal of her first grandchild in order to “help keep her (my mom) out of debt” ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-12,"AITA my sister is trying to plan her gender reveal on my birthday

100,1eqa2ch,AITA for not paying a share of somebody else’s holiday ticket?,"So, around October last year I have booked a holiday with, at the time, 2 very close friends of mine Emily & Brooke. The holiday would have been for 6 people, the three of us, the romantic partners of the other 2 friends and my best friend. 6 in total.

Since then, Brooke and I have had a very bad falling out over nothing significant and haven’t spoken to eachother for about 4 months now. I have made efforts to reach out to Brooke in order to clear the air, but I have received absolutely no reply. Still, we’re all booked in for this big 6 person holiday towards the end of 2024. 

I have considered dropping out of the holiday, but me and my best friend are really looking forward to it since we don’t have many chances to see eachother since we moved to opposite ends of the U.K and to be honest, we’re most likely going to just keep ourselves to ourselves and not interact much with Emily & Brooke during the holiday. 

So, my main issue comes from the fact that Brooke has since separated from her romantic partner. Every single person has made effort to find another person to take over the ticket but nobody has taken the offer. Now, Brooke wants everybody to split the share of Brooke’s ex’s ticket which equates to around £130 each. Am I the asshole if I refuse to pay this? In a normal situation, I wouldn’t mind paying to help a friend. But as I mentioned, Brooke has ignored all efforts I have made to build bridges and clear the air and has no clear interest in sitting down to talk things through. I feel begrudged paying £130 to cover her ex’s ticket and more so asking my best friend for £130, especially because he’s never even met Brooke in his life. Plus, we’re both not amazing financially at the moment so £130 each is hardly pocket change. I have already voiced this opinion to Emily who has called me a massive asshole for even considering this, and I’d be likely screwing her over as well as she, her partner and Brooke will have to cover the entire other ticket cost between the three of them if me and my best friend refuse. 

Am I the asshole for refusing to pay up, and refusing to ask my best friend to pay up, for a person who has no interest in speaking with me anymore?

103,1eq8xid,AITA for not helping to clean up my MIL,"Please do not repost this to other subs. 

This may be long but requires background information. My husband has one sister who is single with no children. Their father is not in the picture. Their mother is very unhealthy, both physically and emotionally. 
MIL is morbidly obese. Not quite bedridden, but not far from it. She has spent 30 years on a couch eating herself to death. Money was never an issue, and She had every resource at her disposal but has refused every option.  Husband and SIL have spent  20 years begging her to make changes. She refused any medication, therapy, surgical options, etc. Her body is now giving out and it’s too late to reverse the damage she has done to herself. 
She lives in an assisted living facility by choice.  My husband and sister in law spent many years cleaning and doing weekly chores at her house. They have now lost most of the sympathy and patience with her as she never put in any effort to take care of herself. 

I’m sure I sound unkind, but please know we tried everything to help, to get her to care about herself (or her children or grandchildren). I know there are mental health aspects to this, but you cannot force someone to go to therapy.

Now to the incident. We attended a large family reunion this weekend. We traveled from several hours away and stayed at a hotel. SIL and MIL live locally, and SIL decided she would bring MIL to the party. I did gently tell her that I thought it was a bad idea. There have to be well planned out accommodations made - how will she walk from the car to the party? Where will she sit? She needs very quick and easy access to the bathroom, etc. 

She decided it was the right thing to do and brought her anyway. My husband was drinking and socializing with his cousins while I watched my young children swimming in the pool. He suddenly walked over and told me my SIL needs my help and to hurry. His mother had soiled herself. This is not uncommon. It has been happening for years. Whether she can’t make it to the bathroom or does but cannot properly clean herself, and she sits in her own filth all day. Which is why she is no longer able to visit us in our home, and she won’t let anyone into hers. It is just not acceptable for my young kids to be around and risk getting sick. 

I told my husband I’m sorry but no. I have my own kids to change and clean up after. I will not leave them unattended in a pool with dozens of rowdy kids and adults who have been drinking. And most of all - just no. It’s gross and unhygienic and I gave up trying a very long time ago. 

I will not take care of someone who refuses to take care of themselves. I told them it was a bad idea to bring MIL, but they didn’t listen. MIL’s sisters and niece were there - why is it my responsibility to literally wipe her ass for her? I can’t do it.

They are both mad at me for “not helping family”. I stand by my decision, but will accept if IATA. ",0.0,0.03685075,0,1

105,1eq8qoh,AITA For Calling My SIL A Manipulative Asshole For Not Inviting Us To My Brother's Wedding,"I (21M) have never gotten along with my brother's (26M) fiancé (25F). She’s always been prissy, acts like she’s too good for us, & involves herself in family matters that aren’t her business. For example, she took my brother in when he said he didn’t feel safe at home during college & chewed us out instead of letting him talk to us. She also went to our grandma's funeral, even though she never met her. She can’t take a joke & calls me a creep, because of said jokes.



She hates my sister because she thinks my sister looks down on her, & thinks my BIL is a POS, because of something he supposedly did to my brother. She hates my parents kicked her out after a fight with her mom. I agreed because she needed to work things out with her mom instead of seeking help or comfort from my brother. My SIL exaggerates her ""abuse"" to gain sympathy, & her mom says she makes up stories about their family, like how her uncle supposedly abused her as a kid (the implication is there).



I love my brother, & always thought we were close, but since his fiancé came into the picture, he’s started drifting away from me. We used to hang out all the time, but now he avoids me & says I hurt him & that I’m transphobic. Everything changed when she came into his life.



Our family welcomed her initially, but now she seems to have convinced my brother not to invite me, my parents, sister, or BIL to their wedding. We only found out about the invitations because a cousin let it slip. My brother & SIL told the rest of the family to keep it a secret because they don’t want “hateful, transphobic bigots” at the wedding. We are NOT transphobic!

If you show up, I WILL throw you out.” Before I could respond, my SIL told me they were cutting us off and blocking us. Then she hung up. I tried to text my brother, but sure enough I'd been blocked. To be honest I don't believe for a second this was my brother's decision. This HAD to be my SIL's decision, because there's no way my brother would leave us out of his wedding without her influence.

106,1eq8mvt,AITA for playing music in my own home?,"I live in a condominium complex. I paid extra for an upgrade during development of the complex for Bluetooth speakers to be installed in my home in the ceiling. There is one unit directly above me and one below me. So of course I wish to use my own Bluetooth speakers that I paid a significant amount for while for example (cleaning, having guests, showering, cooking, etc.) 

Here is where the problem starts. I never once have gotten a complaint from any neighbor nor the people that live below me. Only from the people directly above me. But they’re passive aggressive so they’ll never text me about any issue nor confront me. Instead their “go to” complaint method is to stomp like an ogre until hopefully the incessant stomping dissuades my partner or I from playing music. Mind you I always to be respectful keep the volume under 50% but usually around 30-40% so we can actually still hear the music while doing other activities. Also we only play music through the ceiling during regular hours like 8/9am-8/9pm unless it’s a Friday or Saturday night and we throw a party and have guests over.

Also on the other side of it we can hear them walk around even when not stomping and even move furniture or chairs around practically every time especially when we don’t have any tv or music playing. Yet we don’t complain because we understand we live right under them and assume the developer didn’t pad our ceiling/ their floor properly. And we take it as we can play music and they can just be the noisy neighbors upstairs.

Also another side note. Somehow they can hear the music from my computer speakers which is at desk level when they are at ~45%? I don’t see what more I can really do to try to appease the upstairs neighbors. (Also I can’t wear headsets for elongated periods of time due to my ears, so I normally prefer using my computer with speakers)

Does that make us the assholes for wanting to play music in our own home?

108,1eq8j1l,AITAH - Telling my brother to reconsider marrying SIL,"First time post, also posting on mobile. Looking for advice on how to handle this situation, please help!

This is going to be long, but I’ll try to be as clear as possible. I (24F) have a brother (37) who recently got out of prison a few years ago. During his time, he was speaking to this woman (40), now SIL, and upon his release became engaged to her. 
SIL had a baby (1 y/o) via sperm donor, which my brother had agreed to raise as his own upon his release, he was released early and was able to be there throughout the end of her pregnancy and childbirth.
Now, this is where things get a little crazy. My parents bought a house for my sister and I, and since we had a spare room, he moved in with us along with SIL and baby. My sister and I had been living in this house for two years just ourselves and so having a baby, SIL, and brother move in has been a huge adjustment. My sister and I both work 7am - 3pm, are still in college, and the baby is incredibly needy and cries a lot throughout the day, making being at home incredibly hard for us. As of right now, we’ve been on summer break from school/work and we’ve been at home majority of the time with SIL and baby as she’s a SAHM. Brother works from around 5-3pm M-F in construction. We’ve noticed SIL is constantly on her phone, doesn’t clean up after herself, yells at the baby constantly and as soon as my brother gets home from work, leave the baby to him and she goes into their shared room. We’ve asked her to clean up after herself AND the baby as he explores and makes a mess of things around the house (ex. taking movies out of cabinet, leaving food around, playing in dogs water and spilling it, etc.) As I mentioned, she doesn’t work so she isn’t helping with any of the bills, and she constantly stays home and refuses to go out anywhere with the baby unless my brother is going with her. She also is constantly berating my brother for being tired and getting upset with the baby when he’s crying, despite herself doing the same. There’s so many more things that she does (or lack of) that makes my sister and I question her ability to be a wife, and as bad as it may sound, even a mom.

SO… she’s leaving to visit her family for a week and my sister and I want to have a conversation with my brother about her, and ask what she’s bringing into his life besides from, what it appears, stress. We want him to really think about if he wants to live the rest of his life with her. Personally, we feel as though he should’ve enjoyed his time from being released from prison to get adjusted to life as it is now, and just enjoy his freedom once again, instead of completely diving into having an immense amount of responsibility along with stress so quickly. Would I be the AH to tell him all of this?

110,1eq7yqq,AITA for explaining my Poopoo Dance to my wife’s friends?,"My (30M) wife (28F) recently had some of her friends over for a casual get-together. The evening was going well, with everyone laughing and sharing funny stories. At one point, the conversation turned to quirky habits and routines. My wife brought up my ""poopoo dance,"" which is something I do before I use the toilet.

To clarify, this isn’t just a random dance; it’s more of a ritual for me. I’ve been doing it for as long as I can remember, and it’s something that helps me relax before I go to the bathroom. If I don’t do the dance, I get really stressed out. So, when her friends asked what the dance was like, I figured, why not explain it?

The dance itself is pretty silly. It starts with me standing in front of the bathroom door and doing a little two-step side to side, kind of like swaying from one foot to the other. Then I spin around once, because I need to make sure I’m ""aligned"" (don’t ask me why, it just feels right). After the spin, I do a few quick hops in place—this is supposed to ""shake off"" any lingering tension. Finally, I take a deep breath and march in a circle before heading into the bathroom. It’s a weird mix of a warm-up routine and something that just feels necessary.

Everyone laughed when I showed them, and I thought it was just a lighthearted moment. But afterward, my wife pulled me aside and said I’d embarrassed her by taking it too far. She said it was one thing to mention the dance, but actually demonstrating it was too much information and made the situation uncomfortable for her and her friends.

I thought I was just playing along with the conversation and didn’t see any harm in it. But now I’m second-guessing myself and wondering if I crossed a line by sharing something that’s usually just between us.

I thought I was just playing along with the conversation and didn’t see any harm in it. But now I’m second-guessing myself and wondering if I crossed a line by sharing something that’s usually just between us.

111,1eq7qf3,AITA for sending my ex-husband a letter to pay his child support.,"So I (29F) send my ex-husband (31M) a letter that he has to pay his child support after I already told him he forgot to pay it again.

I've been divorced since december 2022 and every month I have to text him for a reminder to pay and after a week or up to 2 weeks later after several heads ups he asks for a 'tikkie'. A tikkie is a system where I live where you can ask a person to pay it and through the link he can pay the amount that's seen on the screen. It's a systeem I love to use if I split a bill with friends and I pay everything and after dinner I send a link with everybody's 'part'. 
So back to my ex, I've asked him a few times to put it as an automatic monthly pay at his bank. He never did and I always have to ask and I find it horrible to always have to ask him for the money for our kids. Can I go without it, yes but the money is not for me but for the kids and they always get it. He made the choice to not co-parent, he wanted the twins one weekend every 2 weeks. 
After he quit his job and he wanted to stop paying child support I asked a lawyer if he can do that. The lawyer said no cause he quit his job so he has to find a way to get the money. The lawyer asked how the payments go every month and after I told him, he said that I should cover myself for if he ever doesn't pay. I got a letter from him what I should send and if I don't get it I can use a free company that gets all kind of alimony from people that didn't pay. I hated myself for sending it but I'm a pushover and people pleaser so I don't know if I went to far. My ex and I sort of seperated on good terms but there is always something that I do wrong. Not enough clothes, not nice enough clothes, the clothes are to big, I raise them wrong, etc etc. Money wise it's always he pays to much or I'm to rich and I need to help him. We make around the same every month.

112,1eq7gw7,AITA for not getting my partner food after they didn’t cook? ,"Hi, I'm a 27M in my first year of residency. My work life, as expected, is exhausting; it feels like I spend all my time in the hospital (72 hours per week), as I have yet to have a weekend off, which I could really use to just sit on my balcony, staring at the Pacific for hours on end.

This past Saturday, I worked my very first 24-hour shift, and it nearly killed me. My back was aching, my feet were tired, and my brain felt like it needed a factory reset.

On Sunday, I worked from 5:00 to 18:00, which wasn’t too bad. Whenever I have any downtime, I always make sure to check in on my partner, as they work from home, to see how their day is going and to talk about whatever. While we were on the phone, I asked them if they would make my favorite dish, which is simply Katsu with brown rice and a lot of Katsu sauce. They agreed, and I was ecstatic as I haven’t had a homemade meal in a while since I don’t have the energy to cook when I get home and usually just grab something when I get off work, if something I like is still open.

I live a little over an hour and a half outside of the city, but there was a terrible car accident on the highway, so my drive home took well over two hours. I pulled up hungry, ready to eat, but when I walked into the kitchen from the garage, there was no cooked food at all. I was pissed and called out my partner’s name and asked them to come here, but they didn’t answer.

I went upstairs and found them in their office, playing games on their PC. I asked them to stop so we could talk, and I asked why they didn’t cook as they said they would. They admitted they got distracted after getting off work and forgot about it. I said that’s fine, but I would have really appreciated it if they had at least called me to let me know so that I could have stopped to get something while I was already out. I also told them that I felt they were being inconsiderate, as they know how much I have to work and how tired I am when I get home. I can admit that my tone when we were speaking was stern, but I felt it was called for.

They called me an asshole for yelling at them for forgetting this “little thing.” After we were done, I was hungry, so I grabbed my keys and went to get something to eat for myself. I saw that, while I was waiting, they texted me their order, but I ignored them. When I got back home and they saw I didn’t get them anything, they called me a petty asshole and went back upstairs. I didn’t say anything out loud as I wasn’t in the mood and just wanted to eat, shower, and go to bed.

114,1eq7e4m,AITA for not leaving anything to my first daughter.,"Here is the short backstory.  
I 42M, met a girl ""Angela"" at a party 23 years ago, we had fun and then she ghosted me, I did not hear from her for a year as I received an order to pay child support. Turns out I had a kid named ""Marilyn"" who is 22 today.  
It was a shock, but I decided that if that child was mine, I wanted to be part of her life then, but the girl did not agree with me, so I talked with CPS, went to court and managed to be the ""weekend father"" (In process it was made sure that yes, I am the father)... at least on paper.

I never managed actually to meet my child, as CPS was useless, even court was useless and even police is useless.. so for the next 16 years I sent her birthday cards etc until I got a text message: ""Stop harassing me with your cards, I know what kind of man you are, I don't consider you as my father!""  
Well, it broke my heart but I decided to move on, I paid the child support until she was 19 (until the end of high school) and tried to forget about her.

I got married and had 3 kids.

The main part of the story:  
My mother passed away a year ago, she was a successful real estate agent and I was the only child.  
Over her life, she managed to buy 4 apartments as an investment, and I decided to make arrangements that my 3 kids out of my current marriage will get 1 apartment each, Until they finish high school those are rented out and the profit goes investment account that can also be accessed after graduation of high school.  
Remaining 2 homes (one was her own home) I kept as our own investment for retirement.

A few weeks ago the long-lost daughter ""Marilyn"" reached out to me via email saying sorry that my mother died and that she heard that I am giving all my kids an apartment, asked when she would receive hers, and also was curious about what other things grandmother might have left her.  
I was shocked, I have no idea how she got this information, but people talk and kids love to brag about their stuff.  
I replied to her that I did not plan to give her anything, as I paid child support for 19 years and considered my part done. I never got to be the father even though I wanted! A declaration that she didn't consider me as the father hurt me enough.  
I received an angry email from ""Angela"" calling me an asshole for stealing the kid's part of the inheritance and that I really hurt ""Marilyn"".

I had a very long rant ready as a reply and then deleted it, I never sent it out and decided to just not reply.  
My wife is neutral and told me that maybe I should give her one of the remaining apartments, but it is my decision.  
Both ""Angela"" and ""Marilyn"" have called me an asshole via the emails, basically ""so mother was right, this is what kind of person you are!""

We share the place with two other roommates, one of whom is also our landlord (around 60M I’m not sure his exact age). We have our own rooms but share the bathroom, kitchen, and living room. The landlord is pretty chill overall, but he’s extremely particular about cleanliness (and maybe a clean freak?), and it’s starting to wear on me.

I grew up in a really disorganized, messy household where my parents always kept the shower filthy, overflowing dishes in the kitchen, crumbs everywhere, and alot of messiness and disorganization. So, since moving in here, I’ve really tried to break those habits and be respectful of the shared spaces. I genuinely want to keep things clean and tidy, but sometimes I slip up and I might not notice a few crumbs on the floor, or maybe I miss a tiny bit of grease on the stove after cooking. Sometimes I’ll wash a plate or fork, and a tiny spec of food might get missed. I never leave a dish in the sink and I really try to look around after using the kitchen and cleaning to make sure I kept everything cleanly but sadly I sometimes will miss some things. 

The landlord points these things out pretty frequently. He’s not mean about it, but it does make me feel guilty because I want to be better. One thing bugging me though is that some of his rules feel a bit over the top. For instance, he doesn’t let us walk around barefoot because he believes it “warps the wood flooring,” and we’re not allowed to slide chairs at the table, even though they’re light and have felt pads on the feet. We have to pick up the chairs completely off the ground and if we want to sit and be close to the table instead of sitting and sliding your chair in you kinda have to place it close to the table already and awkwardly shimmy into them to sit, which feels really uncomfortable to me.

My girlfriend is extremely thorough with cleaning and has always been very tidy, so I’m trying my best to match that level.

We have not been talking as much as we used to since she went home but I chalked it up to her being home and meeting up with her friends who she hasn't spoken to in ages. Some odd things do happen like her abruptly ending phonecalls and being too busy to talk but I didn't think too much into it. 

I have been pretty involved in the funeral plans plus I have been staying with my parents to help cook and clean for them while they plan the funeral. On the day when it clocked two months of being together, my GF did not communicate with me at all all day. I was pretty sick and after the night wake that night, I needed to head back to my place for the night to sort some other things out. I slept pretty early. I woke up the following day sicker and throwing up so I stayed in bed as my phone charged in another room. 

When I finally got the strength to leave bed at around 2.00pm, I checked on my phone and found that my GF had texted me at 6.30pm the previous evening. She claimed that she had also called me that night at 7.00pm and I didn't pick up. I checked my call log and there was no missed call from her. 

I tried calling her but she refused to pick and said she was going somewhere plus that she would have just preferred to text. I said that I did not see her phone call and I shared my call log with her. She said she called me but she deleted her call log so ""too bad for me"". This statement really angered me because it came off as quite rude. I called her out on it and further asked to know why she deleted her call log. 

She said she had no reason why she did it and insisted that I had offended her by not picking her call. I insisted that she did not call and that it was suspicious that she cleared her call log. I also told her that I did not appreciate the rude statement and that she needs to respect me enough as an adult to speak to me more politely. 

She said that I had hurt her with my words, and that she was broken. I also feel bad because in addition to being offended about the statement, I lost my grams and I'm in a weird place about it, so that could also have contributed to my angered response. We are currently not speaking to each other.

Am I being irrational here? Is it normal for people to just clear their call logs for no reason? Am I the asshole for snapping at her?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-12,"AITAH for snapping at my girlfriend for deleting her call log? Throwaway account because I don't want this traced to my main account.

She lives about 4 hours away so it was gonna be a roadtrip. My stepbrothers both had work so they'd leave later than my dad and stepmom and when asked I decided to just ride up with them.

When we were driving up the entire ride was complete HELL, started off with both of my stepbrothers getting into a fight that lasted at least 30 minutes which was annoying af to listen to. Then when they were done IDK what I even did both dog piled on me when I wasn't even talking and was reading. They purposefully turned up the stereo way louder than needed so I couldn't hear through my earbuds. They'd also get mad if I had them on cause I wouldn't hear them if they asked me something. Also didn't like that I was reading while they were driving.

Needless to say I wasn't too happy with either when we finally arrived. The party was fine and everything but my stepbrothers had to leave a day early for work and asked if I was coming with them. I was still pissed how the car ride up there went and said no, the older of the 2 told me to ""stop acting like a baby"" and that im ""being soft"" I told him to just fuck off and left the room.

They left a couple hours later but my dad came into talk to me saying I can't cuss at my stepbrother and that I owe him an apology tomorrow. Im still sorta mad and dont really wanna talk to either but I am wondering what others think. AITA?

120,1eq5y47,AITA for telling my SIL that I'm no longer available to watch my nephews when my BIL is having surgery?,"I (26F) have 3 nephews who live in the same state as me. They had a rough childhood and so have some emotional regulation issues, but they are astronomically better than they were before my current SIL (32F) was in the picture. Some additional context: I nannies them before SIL was in the picture and the oldest nephew was at a kindergarten reading level before going into 3rd grade a few years ago. I got him close to caught up at a second grade level before he started 3rd grade. At the same time, his youngest brother was 4 and was still only eating purees and was basically non-vernal. I also got him to start using simple phrases like, ""help,"" ""hungry,"" etc and got him eating soft solids. The middle one struggled a little with talking and such, but wasn't as developementally behind. All that to say, I care about these kids a lot and usually would do anything for them. 

Back to present day. Bio mom is back in their lives and gets them overnight two weekends a month. My husband and I also take them over the weekend once a month. So essentially, BIL and SIL only have them one weekend a month and all the kids are school aged. Whenever SIL gets overwhelmed, I try to offer support and resources because I work with kids and have also worked with special needs kiddos. I also work full time (again with kids all day) and am pursuing a doctorate currently. I hardly get any time to do anything fun unless it's spending time with those kids. Well in a couple weeks, BIL is having a surgery where he needs anesthesia. I offered to have the kids that weekend as the surgery is on a Friday where I don't have work. SIL text me and told me something along the lines of, ""Instead of watching the kids, I would love nothing more than if you could join me and some of my friends, sister, and cousin on a girl's weekend."" I said yes, and made sure to ask if BIL would be okay with his surgery and even let her know my husband (who had been helping take care of these kids long before I was even in the picture) would be able to help watch them if needed. She assured me it was going to be fine and that she really, really wanted me to go on this trip with her. Literally less than 24 hours later, SIL texts me saying something along the lines of, ""Oh BIL totally spaced on how he is after anesthesia and we do actually need you to watch the kids. But I'll make sure to let you go on the next girl's trip in a few months."" Not an, ""I'm sorry,"" in sight. I was admittedly really sad and hurt about this, so I said, ""Actually, I won't be available that weekend. I'm sorry."" She was pretty understanding, but now I don't know if I did the right thing.

121,1eq5xku,AITA for not acting excited to lose my hearing?,"I (20f) am part of a friend group of 4 other people (ages between 19-21). All of them are completely deaf or have less than 10% hearing, and they have all had hearing loss since early childhood. It’s all they’ve known,basically. I am the only one in the group who can hear. All of them like to make deaf jokes, and like to make fun of me (as a joke) about how I’m the odd one out. 

However, last year I had a mild head injury and recently I noticed I was having troubles hearing. I went through some tests and things, and I currently have a ~20% loss in both ears, and it will progress. Eventually, by the time I’m 25 or so, I will likely be completely deaf. Obviously I’m not happy about it, majorly because I make my income off my music and dance performances, which will be much more difficult, if not impossible, for me to continue, and it’s really sad I’ll lose that.

I told my friends the news yesterday, and I expected them to feel bad for me, but I guess I didn’t consider this was always their life.

I to,d them this wasn’t exactly good news, and I was permanently *losing my hearing*. They told me not to worry because I was already fluent In ASL and BSL, and getting a regular job away from music wouldn’t be much harder as long as it wasn’t customer service or something.

I said I wasn’t, but they said I should be looking on the bright side instead of looking at all the negatives, and I really *was* coming off as ableist because I didn’t even try to act happy and hide my feelings when I knew they loved being deaf.

122,1eq5wwf,AITA for cussing my boyfriend out?,"Me(18F) and My bf (19M) have been dating for a few months since he asked me to be his gf in April 2024. It’s been a good relationship so far despite minor disagreements but there’s something about our relationship that rubs me the wrong way. He hasn’t told his father or grandparents about us and has been keeping us a secret due to religious beliefs. They believe that young people shouldn’t be dating because it can entice them into doing wrong things i.e. premarital sex (which we’ve already been doing) So ever since we’ve been dating we’ve been meeting in secret against dad’s wishes. It hasn’t really bothered me until now because I thought he doesn’t really have to tell them but they often question him whenever he’s going to hang out with me. His dad has actually told him that me and him are too close and he should basically leave me alone. But my boyfriend assures me that he loves me and won’t leave me. (I’ve told my mom about him and she knows I like him)

Recently I went on vacation and I knew I had to get him a gift so I decided to buy him this really expensive watch. I knew I had to get him something really nice because he means a lot to me. Before I gave him the watch, I asked him that when his family asks him where he got it, he’d say it was from me and not from a random. He said he would do that.

Fast forward I get back and I give him the watch. A few days later I ask him what he told them he said he didn’t show it to them yet . Then in conversation he slips up and tells me he lied and told them he bought the gift for himself. Immediately I get furious because I asked him to tell them he got it from me. I cuss him calling him ungrateful and he’s a b**** and a c*** for lying and he really hurt my feelings. I berated him so badly he just stood there speechless. 

We didn’t talk for a few days until he told me wanted to apologize. We talked it out and he told me he was wrong and he didn’t realize how bad he hurt me. Now I feel bad for cussing him but I’m also not sorry cause I told him how much it meant to me. I’m really two minds about where we are going with this relationship and how we should proceed. It doesn’t sit well with me how he keeps me a secret because he doesn’t want his family to nag him about his religious beliefs. Part of me feels like I should give him an ultimatum but I don’t think that will go well because we are still young adults and figuring life out.

I was Mormon when I started dating him and we talked in the beginning about how he wasn't religious and if it was going to be a problem. It wouldn't be a problem for me, but it was a problem for him.

The more he found out about Mormonism the more he was confused and mad that I was religious as I didn't have a clear reason why and my ""evidence"" was vague. Many heated conversations later, I looked into Mormonism and found a lot of things I didn't know about and didn't like. I am now basically not a Mormon and don't go to church anymore but my family are all faithful believers and still practice. They have told me that it's ok for me to leave that they will still love me and that I shouldn't decide to leave for him, which I agree with.

He has major issues with my family still being Mormon and he ""doesn't want to associate with people who are in a cult"". I am both very annoyed but also understand this perspective so I haven't pushed it much. I told him that if we are going to work long term, he needs to be okay with my family or at least okay with spending time with them.

Previously, I had only gone to his house and he was stressed out about coming to mine, which I get. My parents have many rules about it: no going in rooms, there has to be an adult at home, which I get but can be annoying as I have a very open house and lots of siblings. He was ok with coming over before and has gone to do things with my family, but after the whole Mormon debacle, he won't come over because they are Mormons. Which, I get, but also...uhm...

My parents told me before we went on summer break that I wasn't allowed to go to his house anymore until he came over to ours. I said ok we will talk about it, and I told him. They want to see who I'm dating, which I get, but they are super forceful about it.

Two months later, my boyfriend is back in town I hadn't seen him for those two months and I was looking forward to seeing him. We planned to meet today for dinner, no houses, and I told my mom this. She then says, no I can't see him because we need to talk about rules. If he isn't willing to come to our house, you can't date him. If she had told me this two months ago that would have been a lot better, but instead, she tells me today, the day he gets back, and the only day I can see him. He's super busy and is grinding for the SAT and I don't want to distract him with this, but I've been told I can't meet him until he comes over. He texted me a few weeks ago when I asked about his status on my house situation and he said: If I do come over, can it be after the SAT? So I won't be able to see him for another three-ish weeks at least if he even agrees to date me after hearing all the rules my parents are setting.

MIL is considering buying a cottage. This would be none of my business if it was going to be her property to finance, manage, and care for, but... That is not how this would play out.

She is not in great health. Still has a mortgage on her primary residence and is not able to maintain her house. It's in shambles, and she hoards. This responsibility falls on my husband and his ""two"" brothers.

We have a small child and very busy with our own lives and trying to maintain our own home, we are already overwhelmed. My husband is handy, we have unfinished projects at our house started over 2 years ago, and haven't been able to finish despite using vacation time. He also looks after his mom's house, and everyone's cars in the family including a couple friends (= 9 cars). He is constantly busy working on things, spreads himself too thin, it is too much.

Brother #1 also helps with MIL house but less so as my husband is the handy one. Brother #2 is no help whatsoever, unreliable, ultimately low contact and difficult to get ahold.

Which brings us to the cottage. MIL is sending listings and looking at properties to put a down payment. There has been no discussion what this would look like, who is responsible for looking after it, and what this would entail for everyone involved. The idea is that we'd all get to use this property and my husband is interested in this prospect. My alarm bells are going off, I cannot fathom entering into any arrangement of looking after a secondary property farless the possibility of any possible financial implications.

That is simply not relaxing to me.

MIL has not included me in any of the discussions about said cottage and is sending the property listings to my husband and his brothers to look at.

My girlfriend frequently asks her mother to spend the day with her on weekends, which she, like me, thinks is a bit weird as we’ve actually spoken about it together. She often says she ‘needs to hang out with her mom today’ which while normal, seems a bit excessive when it’s every week. It’s also worth mentioning that most girls i know including my sister, don’t really cling on to their moms at this age and have kind of grown more independent.

This has also manifested in our relationship, where no matter how much time I spend with her, it’s never enough and im constantly apologising for leaving to the point where i’ve started to just stay as late as possible and sacrifice sleep and spending time with my friends to keep her happy. I’ve told her she needs to be more considerate that i have work commitments, or that I like to go to the gym a few times a week, but she’s only happy if i’m with her. 

A couple days ago i came to her house after work and immediately crashed on the bed and fell asleep as i was exhausted. She kept waking me up saying ‘Don’t fall asleep you’re meant to spend time with me’. I let out all my frustration and told her how her need to constantly spend time with me is so draining and frustrating, and it’s not healthy. She didn’t respond and just started giving me the silent treatment. I was honestly not having this at all, where i tell her how i feel and then have to apologise trend that’s been going on for ages, and just left.

Sarah told me that I need to go right now, and I just said no and continued what I was doing. After the song was done I did get up and close it, Sarah did not have to use the bathroom either, Sarah was doing makeup.

Since then I have not forgotten and over this period of 2 weeks Sarah has been leaving 4-5 bottles of whatever on the seat, and I'm assuming Sarah is trying to get me to realize what it is like to have to close the seat, but I only just realized this.

133,1eq4g9z,AITA For telling my biological son to stop calling me “Mom”? ,"*throwaway*

So long story short: when I (40F) was a teenager I had a baby and gave him up for adoption. I did this through and agency and one of the stipulations of the contract required the adoptive parents to provide my contact information to him after he was an adult so that if he ever wanted to contact me, he could. 

Sure enough, 18 years later I get a letter in the mail and he wants to meet. I said yes and his Mom flew with him to meet me in my state. We had a great visit and it was amazing getting to know the great young man he grew up to be. We have kept in contact over the last couple years, I let him meet my kids and let him form a brotherly bond with them. 

Then he started calling me Mom… it feels weird to me for him to call me that and it feels disrespectful to his Mom who I think is amazing to be so forthcoming and supporting of him having a relationship with me and my family. I really didn’t want to hurt him, but I explained my feelings to him about a week ago and I haven’t heard from him since. While it is common for us to go for long periods of time without talking, I have a feeling that this particular bout of silence is due to him being upset and I am feeling guilty about it. Am I the asshole here? 

EDIT 2: (clearly I am an inexperienced poster) it is worth mentioning that we met after he turned 18. He is going to be 23 next month. 

I guess I thought it would be assumed that he was in his 20’s since I am 40 and birthed him as a teen. 

EDIT: Okay so I made this post just before bed last night and did NOT expect it to have so many comments by this morning. To clarify a couple of things I have seen in the comments:

1. I gave him up at birth. He has never known me to be his mother and his adoptive Mom is his only Mom. 

2. Giving him up was the single hardest thing I have ever done in my entire life. So to the people who say I rejected him, you have no idea what you’re talking about. 

3. I went through an agency and specifically chose his parents from stacks and stacks of files. He has had a wonderful life full of so many more opportunities than my teenage self could have ever dreamed of giving him. 

4. I didn’t just blurt out “Don’t call me mom” or “I am not your mom”. We had a conversation about it where I told him I was uncomfortable with it and he seemed understanding about it and where I was coming from. 

5. He harbors ZERO feelings of abandonment or rejection. His parents are wonderful parents and he had a great life. His desire to meet me did not come from a “why did you abandon me” place. He was curious about me and wondered how much of his personality is nature vs nurture. (Spoiler alert, a LOT of his personality is nature). As an only child though, he was very excited to meet his brothers. 

6. I don’t think he wanted to call me Mom because he felt some mother-son connection between us. He said that he felt like I deserve a title that is more than just “lady I got DNA from” especially around his brothers. I told him it is fine just to call me by my first name. 

7. His bio father died of a drug overdose some years ago. And NO, I did not give him up because I was on drugs. I have never even smoked pot in my life.

EDIT: Okay so I made this post just before bed last night and did NOT expect it to have so many comments by this morning. To clarify a couple of things I have seen in the comments:

1. I gave him up at birth. He has never known me to be his mother and his adoptive Mom is his only Mom. 

2. Giving him up was the single hardest thing I have ever done in my entire life. So to the people who say I rejected him, you have no idea what you’re talking about. 

3. I went through an agency and specifically chose his parents from stacks and stacks of files. He has had a wonderful life full of so many more opportunities than my teenage self could have ever dreamed of giving him. 

4. I didn’t just blurt out “Don’t call me mom” or “I am not your mom”. We had a conversation about it where I told him I was uncomfortable with it and he seemed understanding about it and where I was coming from. 

5. He harbors ZERO feelings of abandonment or rejection. His parents are wonderful parents and he had a great life. His desire to meet me did not come from a “why did you abandon me” place. He was curious about me and wondered how much of his personality is nature vs nurture. (Spoiler alert, a LOT of his personality is nature). As an only child though, he was very excited to meet his brothers. 

6. I don’t think he wanted to call me Mom because he felt some mother-son connection between us. He said that he felt like I deserve a title that is more than just “lady I got DNA from” especially around his brothers. I told him it is fine just to call me by my first name. 

7. His bio father died of a drug overdose some years ago. And NO, I did not give him up because I was on drugs. I have never even smoked pot in my life.

134,1eq4fvo,WIBTA for removing FMILs friends from bridal shower invite list?,"
I’m getting married later this year, and my FMIL + best (wo)man have generously offered to host a bridal shower back in my fiancé’s home state. I’m super grateful for this and will be happy with whatever they plan. The issue, however, is the guest list. 

Both the ladies planning the shower have decided this is the perfect time for me to meet a bunch of FMIL’s friends who haven’t gotten the chance to meet me prior. Based on this, you can probably guess the issue: they are not invited to the wedding. 

I’m really uncomfortable with this and feel it’s beyond tacky to invite someone to buy gifts and talk about an event they’re not included in. I have voiced this, and have gotten pushback from both planners that this won’t be an issue and it would be ruder of me to be in town and host a shower without them. 

Because I feel this is relevant context: 8 months ago, before we even looked at venues, we sent both sets of parents our “rough draft guest list” to see if there was anyone we might have missed. We clarified it wasn’t free range to add whoever they wanted, but was a starting point for a conversation if they were surprised or upset about any of our decisions. My parents, who are paying for about 50% of the wedding, had 2 couples to add. My FMIL said it was perfect and offered no other feedback. She is not contributing anything financially to the wedding.

I cannot stand my best friend's boyfriend. They started dating about seven or eight months ago, and I met him shortly after. They've known each other for years but I didn't know him before, as they weren't close.

To put it bluntly, he is insufferable. He's rude, arrogant (including bossing around my parents), snobbish, and consescending. He thinks he's so much smarter than everyone and boasts all the time, even telling outright lies. He accuses people of insulting him all the time and sulks like a kid. He acts like a 5 year old who had a bad sleep. I have no idea what she sees in him. He is patronizing to me, ironically, and even says he feels sorry for me.

I have a longstanding (almost 2 years!) and mutual crush on a guy, but due to our shyness we haven't actually gone on a date. But we will! We just have to get over our painful awkwardness. LOL. Anyway, he is chronically ill, disabled, and suffers some pretty serious mental health issues (C-PTSD). My best friend has been very vocal about her disapproval of my budding romance with him. She has Aspergers so I'm not offended by her dissaproval -- she doesn't understand having a 'filter.'

I didn't have work today, so I hadn't opened the pack yet. Then, my younger brother (9 M) came to me and said, ""Oh, by the way, she ate your yogurt."" My sister immediately denied it but started laughing when my brother asked why the container was in her room. I checked the fridge, and one yogurt was missing. My sister then said it was nasty anyway. I got really mad and said some pretty harsh things  to her because the one thing I asked her was not to eat my yogurt, and she did exactly that.

I admit I went overboard with the name calling, but I was really heated because I've repeatedly brought up how no one in my family respects my things, and it keeps happening.

142,1eq2rz5,AITA for backseat driving my husband with a terrible driving record? ,"For context, he’s been driving since he was 17 (he is now 27). His first car was a write off due to an at fault accident while merging onto a highway. The next car was written off because he was following a large truck too closely in the winter and slid on ice and hit the truck. About ~6-7 years later in 2023 he totals MY car in an attempt to… exit. This past May, he was driving my new car and he rear ended someone. Again, following too closely. He will argue about these “following too closely” labels endlessly. He absolutely will not accept the fault as him following too closely, it’s always something else. The ice. The gravel on the road. It was an accident. You name it. He refuses to grasp that if he had provided himself with more distance in these moments, regardless of debris or weather on the road, he would have had adequate time to stop. He is so stubborn that I won’t bother arguing this with him because he will not move on his opinion and swears up and down they’re not his fault. 

Needless to say, he is not insured on my current vehicle because he is a liability. However, I do allow him to drive to the corner store because sometimes I don’t want to do it or I’m in the middle of something and it’s just easier. Today, I walked with our kids to a park in our neighbourhood, and he met us later with the car. We were all inside while he was driving to the corner store. He was speeding (doing 60 in a 50 km/hr zone) and I felt like he was following too closely to the car ahead of us. I said something like “don’t drive like your dad”, who is notoriously an aggressive driver. Not the nicest comparison, and he really was bothered by that. I backpedaled a bit and said it wasn’t that hard to drive less aggressive. I said no, you’re not speeding 50 over the limit like your dad, but you’re speeding and too close to the guy ahead of us. Just slow down. He had shut off at this point and had resorted to saying he just won’t drive anymore (as if you do, but okay). We paused there. 

Later, he came to apologize for his reaction. I apologized as well for upsetting him. I’m having a hard time delivering a genuine apology without adding “but you have an awful record and I always feel like you follow too close and I was having a physical reaction and I spoke up because I felt uncomfortable and all you had to do was slow down and say ‘I don’t think so but I’ll slow down because you asked’”. He’s insisting that I shouldn’t have said anything at all. When mentioning his history, he said there’s been many times that he’s been uncomfortable with me driving. Sure, I make mistakes and admit there are areas I can improve. I also have not had several crashes due to it, and right now I am telling you that I am uncomfortable with how you are driving. Does it not make sense to respect that?

About ~6-7 years later in 2023 he totals MY car in an attempt to… exit. This past May, he was driving my new car and he rear ended someone. Again, following too closely. He will argue about these “following too closely” labels endlessly. He absolutely will not accept the fault as him following too closely, it’s always something else. The ice. The gravel on the road. It was an accident. You name it. He refuses to grasp that if he had provided himself with more distance in these moments, regardless of debris or weather on the road, he would have had adequate time to stop. He is so stubborn that I won’t bother arguing this with him because he will not move on his opinion and swears up and down they’re not his fault. 

Needless to say, he is not insured on my current vehicle because he is a liability. However, I do allow him to drive to the corner store because sometimes I don’t want to do it or I’m in the middle of something and it’s just easier. Today, I walked with our kids to a park in our neighbourhood, and he met us later with the car. We were all inside while he was driving to the corner store. He was speeding (doing 60 in a 50 km/hr zone) and I felt like he was following too closely to the car ahead of us. I said something like “don’t drive like your dad”, who is notoriously an aggressive driver. Not the nicest comparison, and he really was bothered by that. I backpedaled a bit and said it wasn’t that hard to drive less aggressive. I said no, you’re not speeding 50 over the limit like your dad, but you’re speeding and too close to the guy ahead of us. Just slow down. He had shut off at this point and had resorted to saying he just won’t drive anymore (as if you do, but okay). We paused there. 

Later, he came to apologize for his reaction. I apologized as well for upsetting him. I’m having a hard time delivering a genuine apology without adding “but you have an awful record and I always feel like you follow too close and I was having a physical reaction and I spoke up because I felt uncomfortable and all you had to do was slow down and say ‘I don’t think so but I’ll slow down because you asked’”. He’s insisting that I shouldn’t have said anything at all. When mentioning his history, he said there’s been many times that he’s been uncomfortable with me driving. Sure, I make mistakes and admit there are areas I can improve. I also have not had several crashes due to it, and right now I am telling you that I am uncomfortable with how you are driving. Does it not make sense to respect that?

Have you been the partner with a poor driving record? Should I have shoved my anxiety aside in that moment? ",2.0,0.028552314,0,0
143,1eq2hnu,AITA for telling my dad I don’t want to sleep in a bunkbed,"I 30F am recently married to my husband 33M. I don’t live in the same state as my parents so we all travel to see each other a few times per year. Two weeks ago my dad called me and asked if he could come visit for a few days while my mom hosted some friends at their house. I told him I would be returning from work the same day as his arrival and would be very tired. He said no problem, he would get a hotel the first night and then would like to take my husband and I to the coast for a few days. 

My work schedule is a two week on, two week off rotation. When I’m gone to work I live in a dorm like community setting with bunkbeds. My job is demanding and stressful, and the commute home is long and tough. When I get home I usually just want to sleep and hang out with my husband for the first few days. I have learned the hard way that if I don’t give myself this down period I usually get sick. (I’ve had covid 5 times.) But going to the coast with my dad and husband seemed reasonably restful so I said yes. 

This morning he sends me the link to the Airbnb he has already booked and the second bedroom, where my husband and I are expected to sleep, is a set of bunkbeds. 

I called him and gently but directly told him I was not stoked on sleeping in a bunk bed. That I had been up at work for two weeks, was commuting home on the red eye, and was in need of restful sleep. He got defensive and said this was the only place he could find. I told him then I would have appreciated at least being asked if I was okay with sleeping in the bunkbed. He said that he was planning to sleep in the bunkbed so he didn’t understand why he needed to clear that with me. My dad is a big man. In no world was he planning to sleep in that bunkbed, and he knows that I won’t make him. 

Well come to find out the house is non refundable so we’re stuck with this arrangement. At 30 years old I’m tired of not being considered as an adult in decisions like this. At this point in my life I can’t just sleep anywhere and be fine. Not to mention I have missed my husband terribly and always sleep best when we sleep together. 

My sister is on my side as she has also experienced a lifetime of these situations with Dad. Mom says I’m being ungrateful and now I’ve made Dad feel like I don’t want to spend this time with him.

I love my job and I love my friends so it has always been an easy choice for  me. However I am currently 26 weeks pregnant with my first child and trying to lessen my workload as I prepare for my maternity leave and pass larger projects over to my employees. 

My friend informed me last night that she is getting married, I was of course so happy for her and congratulated her, she asked if i'd be making her dress for her and I told her of course, to just let me know when they had a date and I was told they already had a date, January 19th. That was fine, a year and five months, perfect, plenty of time to do the designs and make it and I expressed as much to her but she corrected me, it wasn't January 19 2026 like i assumed, but January 19, 2025. I was a bit shocked at this and told her that if that's the date she'd picked i'd have to take back my promise as there is no way I can make her dress in that time frame as i'll not be too long post partum. 

I asked her to reconsider the date if she wanted  me to make a dress  pointing out how five months wasn't much to plan a wedding anyway but she insisted that was when she wanted it, I didn't push as it was up to her but I made it clear I will not be able to make her dress for her then. 

She didn't understand this at all pointing out how i'll be taking time off work soon anyway and can't I just use that time to make her dress. I admit in hindsight I got a bit snappish here and she likely didn't realise just how much work goes into a wedding dress but I asked her if she'd hit her head and why she'd think  it's ok to ask me to put stress on my pregnancy for her wedding dress? 

She has been putting messages in the group chat calling me out for it and saying how it's easy to tell who my favourites are and it's clear her feelings are hurt.

I'm annoyed but also feeling a bit regretful about this, I can't trust my employees to make a wedding dress without me as their skill level isn't up to that but maybe I could have a rehearsal dinner dress made for her or even a reception dress to soothe the hurt of her not getting the custom dress she wants",Not the A-hole,2024-08-12,"AITA for telling my friend I can't make her wedding dress despite making them for two other friends?

146,1eq2662,AITA for lashing out at my mother?,"Earlier today I had an argument with my mother and I can’t shake the feeling I was in the wrong. 

The argument started after I had cooked my dinner, and I had cooked extra at my mothers request so she could have some. I cooked 8 in total, 4 for me and 4 for her. After I cook and dish up the whole of my meal, spring rolls included, she goes outside to do things (not entirely sure what all that matter is she disappears) and, not seeing her in the room and as such reminding myself I cooked some for her, autopiloted and ate all I had, extra spring rolls included. She comes back in after what felt like 5ish minutes and asks if I had finished my food already. After confirming that I had accidentally also eaten her rolls too, she shouts at me, asking “did you not think about how much food you had on your plate or are you just too gutty?”. 

Now, I’ve struggled with my weight for a long time (14 stone 10 pounds now, aiming to cut down to 12 stone eventually) and she is aware of my weight struggles as well as my feelings towards it, so this cut deep. I ended up lashing out at my mother, saying that “whenever I think of you all I can think of is the insults you throw at me”. She has a habit of insulting me whenever she’s upset at me, but normally I can shrug it off considering it’s nothing I haven’t heard before. She then looks at me and begins to list the times in recent weeks how she has been giving me money to spend out with friends, or on dates, saying “you don’t think of that at all?”. She then also brings up a lot of the time that whenever she needs something done, she always asks me for help and that I don’t actually offer to help her. In my mind, I thought of instances where I do help her out. For instance, she needs to be injected with medicine a lot, which I am more than happy to do. Other things I do for her consist of taking her clean washing-up upstairs for her, helping take the bins out, or whenever something needs to be taken out of our very overcrowded shed I am there to provide the extra muscle necessary as she is encroaching on 60 and has numerous health issues that would make it dangerous for her alone to be moving them.

She hadn’t eaten a proper meal this whole week, so those spring rolls were going to be some semblance of an actual meal for her instead of a cobbled together sandwich and the like.

Am I the asshole for not giving her their contact details? I could just be blowing up a minor issue.",0.0,0.021796167,0,1
149,1eq1urh,WIBTAH if I asked my neighbor to move their trash can?,"I live in an end unit in a townhouse community. We have a unique trash situation as every house has individual bins (black for trash blue for recycling). Technically, we’re supposed to keep them in the garage but the community as a whole has essentially agreed to just leave them out because our garages are small. 

So everyone has at least 2 garbage bins outside their garage. It’s a townhouse setup where two rows of houses share a “road” that’s between the two rows of garages. 

Everyone’s a little different but for the most part, they leave one trash bin on each side of their garage. We used to leave both of ours on one side because the garbage company didn’t pick up the trash if I left it on the other side because he couldn’t “reach” it. That’s no longer the case after they got their shit together. So I moved one of mine to the other side. 

My neighbor always had their two bins on one side but now they want to put one of their bins next to mine. Totally fine as that’s expected to happen since it’s a tight space. My issue is that instead of setting it up so that we share an equal amount of space, they push mine farther so that it blocks part of my garage and so that their garage doesn’t have to be blocked by their bin. I’ve moved them before so that it’s equally blocking a little of our garages but they keep pushing mine back. 

I know it’s a small thing and I do feel somewhat petty but it’s been gnawing at me. It doesn’t help that sometimes they don’t even bother to close the lid so that they can easily throw trash away. It also annoys me because I can see them doing it via camera and they’re clearly discussing the situation and pointing at other neighbors set ups to excuse theirs. 

WIBTAH for confronting them or should we just continue this whole semi passive aggressive act of pushing the bins back and forth lol


TL;DR - townhouse community with tight space so everyone’s bins are always out. We all have to share the space between garages to place our bins there.

150,1eq1ubl,AITA for what I said about bf’s mom’s death?,"I wanted to get opinions on this conversation with my bf.

My bf's mom died during childbirth. She always had a lot of health problems and a ""weird body"" (as my bf's dad described) but she really wanted to be a mom and have her own child and she did that.

Her birthday happened, so we went to her gravesite and put up flowers and we talked a little bit about her.

We have talked about it multiple times, and I know he's really sad about what happened. But he surprised me when he said that we probably shouldn't even be here, that technically he was the worst thing to happen to her, maybe she doesn't even want him visiting her gravesite.

It took for back for sure. I said of course she would want that. She wanted a kid really bad, she'd probably be happy to know he was living a happy life.

He said oh please, she would be wishing she never gave birth to me for sure.

I was like... oh no. I mean my heart broke that he feels that way. So I said like of course she would be happy, she's a mom. My mom would die for me over and over again. Mom's love their kids and she decided to have a kid, she knew the complications.

He snoffed and said she didn't even know me. Your mom knows you, so yeah, she'd do anything for you. I'm just a horrible end to her life, and I don't want to hear that she would have wanted it like this when it's not true, you just want to make me feel better.

It felt like the conversation was over so I just said well, I'm really happy it ended like that. I'm really happy your here and not her.

152,1eq1mpj,AITA for Enforcing the Legal Custody Agreement?,"My ex and I have been divorced since March 2020. We are both female living in the US. The marriage mainly ended because she cheated on me, but after years of going to therapy, I realized I wasn't a great partner either. We rarely ever agreed on anything unless one person caved under the guise of ""compromise"".


During the marriage we had two children (11F and 8M) and we each gave birth to one child. In the beginning of the divorce, we tried the 2-2-5 schedule. In June 2021, my ex wanted to change to a week on/week off schedule. We signed the paperwork with our lawyers and filed it with the courts. 


A side note: I am a people pleaser. I have taken numerous phone calls from my ex about how I need to change something at my house because she doesn’t like it. I would take the phone calls and all the blame and try to change things. 



This summer, my ex brought up the idea of giving the kids the option to choose the parent they want to stay with more. I wasn’t too excited about it, but the kids really liked the idea and I figured it’s the summer. My daughter chose me and my son chose my ex. I rationalized it as little kids want their Mom. We decided to do the “modified schedule” from June to the middle of July and then discuss how it went.


To sum it up, it didn't go well. My ex told me she was trying to keep my son from me to ""protect him"" because I won't follow her recommendations for a healthy diet. Now, please remember, both kids live at both houses equally. 


I told my ex I am done with the modified schedule. I want week/week back. She fought me and said we promised the kids until the middle of July.


Finally, the end of July comes and we all meet together to talk about how the modified schedule went. We have family meetings randomly, so this was not out of the ordinary.


My ex started off saying she wanted to hear everyone's thoughts about how it went during the summer. My daughter brought up an idea which my ex quickly shot down. My son liked modified and my ex wanted to do modified until November.


I was shocked she was trying to have a custody conversation in front of the kids. I was beyond angry. I would handle the phone calls because it was towards me, but this time the kids were involved.


I told my ex we were going back to week/week schedule and that was it. We were doing the legal custody agreement and I am done with modified. I have compromised enough.

My three youngest had never flown before, and were very excited to watch out the windows, one of the other children is special needs. So, I was very specific when booking (and booked early) to ensure we had 3 window seats in 3 consecutive rows, and that one adult was in the middle row. (Window; window, middle, aisle; window; one adult several rows away due to seat availability).

The issue began because of an error by the airline (no explanation). When we arrived, an older couple (early 70s?) were already in the second row window and middle seats, completely destroying my plan. Comparing tickets, they had the same seat numbers and aisle that we did. 2 rows back had a window and center empty as well. I asked the couple to move to the other row (still window and center seats, and still mid-plane), but they said they were already comfortable and refused. The flight attendant also asked them to move, and the woman asked ""what's in it for us?"" When the flight attendant didn't offer anything, she stated that if there was nothing in it for her she wouldn't move. She was aware of the situation with our kids, and that this was an airline error not just a request to move ""for the kids."" Rather than escalate and hold up the flight, we wound up with the family split, neither adult with the kids, and one of the kids without a window (Sam needed an adult beside him).

Several hours later I am in the aisle, ensuring that the kids all have the chance to see out the window and avoiding a meltdown from Sam. Not disrupting anyone, except where I stood directly blocked the aisle where the couple was. To be fair, I had been there several minutes. The kids were fine, but then the older man says something like ""My wife needs to use the restroom, and you are blocking the aisle."" I looked at him, and told him that I only needed to be there because the family was split, and if she hadn't been such a self-serving \*\*\*\*\* she would have been able to go just fine, so she could wait until I'm damn good and ready.

I 21F have been friends with Reilly 20F and josh 20M for 3 years. We have a close friend group with my partner and one other couple. 

Reilly and Josh are super kind and loving people but are constantly late to any event or plan hosted by the group. So far we brushed it off as we just wanted to see everyone. This year the other couple is leaving and we won’t see them until after we all graduate in the summer. Josh initiated a meet up on Friday for the group, as it was the last chance to see eachother.

158,1eq0w0l,AITA for causing my brother to have a meltdown because I didn’t give him sushi?,"Did I fuck up? I’ve been visiting my family over the last week and it’s my last day here. So far it’s been a disaster. There’s a lot of roles and family dynamics which are unhealthy and I’m the eldest (29) and the only one who doesn’t live at home.

My sister (18) and I are parentified a lot and my mother spends most of her time elsewhere. Today I decided it would be a good idea to get the twins (13) to do some of their chores, but in a way which doesn’t involves them being micromanaged and utilising them having to improvise, I told them I trusted them to do it but be aware that we are in a time crunch because my mother gets angry if she arrives home and the house isn’t spotless. I was helping them during this but they were stalling on purpose and doing the bare minimum for 5 hours (the tasks could potentially take 20 minutes but everyone is different of course) my sister and I tried to explain patiently the urgency of the situation but my brother apparently was very rude to her and they ended up having a very heated argument. I tried to explain how my sister was reacting this way because a lot of responsibility falls on her unfairly and he wasn’t empathising with her. His argument was he thought it was clean enough so he doesn’t understand why she was yelling at him for no reason. 

My other brother understood and admitted he fucked up, saying he was stalling.

So, another argument broke out when I got sushi. I gave my sister some but decided the twins didn’t deserve any due to their lack of empathy for my sister which happens on a consistent basis to the point she’s burnt out. A huge argument and fight broke out. There was screaming, he called us bitches. There was a lot of chaos over the last few hours. 

The majority of the family say I shouldn’t feel guilty because they believe I’m being treated unfairly. I spent the last week catering and caring for my family, I specifically put attention to the brother who had this meltdown because I’m aware he’s been bullied and struggling lately. 

I’m afraid this triggered him, however he was also angry at me because he couldn’t use my gaming laptop just now, whilst simultaneously shit talking me to his friends on Snapchat. I understand he’s a kid and kids react. I feel guilty and like I messed up by ordering sushi…

160,1eq0psp,AITA for telling my (19F) roommate (19F) I’d like to room with someone else after she’s been MIA for 2-3 months. ,"Okay here’s come context. My two friends and I decided to room together our sophomore year of college. Since it’s a 2x2, and there’s four people, we’d be sharing rooms. I’m sharing a room with my friend, let’s call her Carol, and our other friend, Madison, is sharing a room with a randomly assigned roommate because she picked a windowless room. 

Carol had been texting us after the school year was over up until mid/end of May. Afterwards, it’s been crickets. I’ve tried reaching out to her, calling, texting, and emailing her to see if she’s okay. I’ve also reached out to mutual friends to see if anyone’s heard from her, and I’ve called our building multiple times over these two months to see if she’s still on the lease. 

Around a week-and a half ago, our first payment for the lease was due, and we still hadn’t heard from Carol. Madison and I contacted our building to see if she had paid. Lo and behold, she had paid for the first month. This indicated to me that she had been ignoring us for the past two months. Another tidbit, I knew she was on her phone because she recently followed Leah from love island on her spam (ik this is so random but Leah just got famous so it showed me she had been using her phone) and I’m 99% sure she had unfollowed me on her spam while keeping me as a follower. 

 After finding out she had paid her part, Madison and I were understandably hurt and frustrated. We had discussed previously that we had wished we had been sharing the room together instead of Carol and I. So I decided to send Carol this text because I’m not longer comfortable living with her after she’s ignored us for two and half months. 

“Carol, moving forward it makes more sense for Madison  and I to share a room. We had to learn from the leasing office that you’ve paid in full, while you’ve been ghosting us for three months. Quite honestly the two of us (Madison and I) have been trying to figure out the logistics of this apartment and I think it would just make more sense at this point for us two to share a room as we’ve been in communication more.”

This garnered no response. However, today she reached out to Madison saying “sorry for the lag I didn’t mean to worry anyone a lot has been happening. It would be nice if we could talk sometime” she did not reach out to me. She’s been known to ghost/ignore people at any sign of conflict so I’m not surprised she’s still ignoring me, but I am hurt. 

I’m wondering if I shouldn’t have sent to text at all. Now that I know she might’ve been going through something terrible, maybe I was too harsh? I also don’t want her to ignore me, I want us to talk things out, especially since we’re sharing a room. I feel that sending the text has done more harm than good. AITA? 

Edit: The three of us are very good friends and another reason I’m concerned about this is that Carol and I share many mutual friends and I don’t want to compromise my relationship with other ppl bc of this.

So 2 months ago, I finally got my drivers license. But, I am not allowed to drive alone, bc ""I'm not ready"". So everytime someone is going to drive to the city and I have time, I ask if I can drive to  practice more. Most of the time is a no, because it would stress them or other excuses.

Its an ongoing discussion because sometimes they are sleeping and I have to wake them up for a trip to college when my class is gonna start in 30 minutes. Sometimes they forget that I have class at an X hour so when I go remind them, they get mad at me because I didn't tell them earlier. I literally cannot be spontanous, and it makes my blood boil. Most of the trips that they are making home are not always announced, but I'm the one that gets shit on because I don't announce my every change in schedule. I have to go around asking everyone through message if they have a planned trip soon, and when I tell them that I need one they get mad because I didn't say so earlier, and when I say I couldn't because it just came up, they turn it around and say that I should ""think about those things"" and ""consider getting up early"" to be ready to go the city whenever they have the time to do it.

Tonight having a guest over for dinner, the theme came up, and my dad started telling about how ""the other day I told my brother in law that I needed to go to class at 3pm but he had class at 5pm and I MADE him to take me to my class"", which is completely not what happend. Then my older sister and brother in law started telling the guest how I am incapable of considering others times and that I FORCE THEM to take me whenever I need it. I lowered my gaze and started to focus on something I was writing on my laptop, but the guest noticed and started saying ""did you get mad? are you mad?"" and then my sister said ""oh of course he's angry, it's because we are making him look bad in front of you"" in a mocking tone. I ignored them and the guest tried to cheer me up but I also ignored it.

It angers me that they all criticize me on how I take on this arrangement, when I'm sure if they were on my position they wouldn't do any different. They talk to me like I don't understand how to announce and schedule myself, when they never had have to consider all their schedule based on others.

163,1epzvce,AITA for not leaving the necklace behind?,"My friend got married 2 weeks ago. I was one of the bridesmaids. For her bachelorette party, I surprised her and the bridal party with necklaces that I had made by a local artist. They had everyone’s first initial and a gem with their favorite color. My friend loved them and asked if I could have them made for her mom, future mother-in-law and her grandmother because she wanted all the women walking down the aisle to wear these. I said absolutely, got their favorite colors and submitted it to the artist. Keep in mind, I also paid for these out of pocket but didn’t mind.

The wedding comes along. I knew my friend had a falling out of sorts with her grandmother. Short of it is, Grandma had started dating someone new within a year of her husband’s death. Friend’s mom felt it was too soon and was in her feelings about the situation. Big fight happened. They all made up but my friend no longer wanted her grandmother walking down the aisle. The necklace was made weeks before this kerfuffle so I still brought it.

The night before the wedding, we all stayed at an Air B&B. I put out the boxes with everyone ‘s necklaces so they could grab them before we left. Friend’s grandma wasn’t there but figured friend would grab it and bring it to the venue. As we’re leaving to go to the venue, I hear her mom saying something about “Just leave it, just leave it”. I walk into the kitchen and grandma’s necklace is on the counter. My friend noticed me and asked if I’d be okay with us not giving the necklace to her grandmother. I was a little taken aback and her mother stepped in and said “we’re not taking this with us”. I pointed out that the necklace was already made and cost quite a bit. Her mom said “No, she is not a part of this wedding, she is NOT wearing it”. My friend agreed. I said fine to end the argument.

My friend asked if I was upset and I said “A little, these cost a bit to make. Could I just give it to her after the wedding?” My friend told me no, she didn’t want her grandmother to have it, period. I went to bring it with me, with plans to keep it in my purse so I could bring it home when the wedding was over and try to resell it somehow (artist doesn’t do refunds, understandably) or maybe gift it to someone else at some point. My friend’s mom started yelling “Leave it here!” I tried to explain myself and my friend and her mom started insisting I leave it there, convinced I was going to give it to the grandmother.

I have a serious ear condition that means im even more sensitive to sound than most so i have an extremely hard time listening to even slightly loud noises. My young cousins (2 and 4) where coming over. We mostly had a good time and as we where all leaving and saying goodby my cousins who where in the car honked the horn and it shocked me they kept doing it so I covered my ears and eventually walked away but was forced to come back by my mom who forcefully removed my fingers from my ears. I didn’t yell at the kids or cuss them out or anything. When everyone left my mom screamed at me and scolded me for being supposedly rude.

165,1epzq2g,WIBTA for turning my son's bedroom into a guest room?,"My son is 19 and starting his sophomore year of college in a few weeks. His mom and I have been separated for almost his whole life and we previously had split custody. I married when he was 9 and had another son who is now 10. However, my ex-wife and I divorced in 2020.

After the divorce I bought a new house that was very close to my eldest son's mom (15-minute walk). It's technically a 4-bedroom, so each of my sons have their own room and I use the smallest room as my office. When I bought the house, I put a lot of effort into making the boy's rooms personalized to them and I know they have both been really happy about their spaces.

However, currently my eldest son's bedroom functions more like a guest room than his own personal space and I'm thinking of making the change official.

He doesn't really use the space to sleep in anymore. He's away at college for most the year and even when he's home he spends most of his nights at his mom's home. He already works for me during school breaks, and we do a lot together outside of work, so his preference is to spend time with his mom in the evenings.

The room is now used more by other people, most of whom are woman/girls.

My girlfriend (been together about 14 months) has a 4-year-old daughter who has started sleeping over at my house with her mom on occasion and has been staying in my son’s room.

My 2 nieces (11 & 9) also sleep over at my house a lot. My sister's a single mom who works late/nights often and they stay with me when she has to work later than their bedtime.

My youngest sister also stays with me regularly as she now lives a few hours away and likes to come back to our city to see family and friends.

I've already had to move some things out of my son's room to keep it away from the girls, but he still has a lot of stuff in there. The room is also overtly masculine, which seems strange when the main occupants are not.

My son has had no issue knowing all these people are using his room and I'm considering asking him if he wouldn't mind if I switched the room up. I want to redecorate and get a couple new beds. I also want the girls to keep some of their things in the room plus get some toys and games for them.

I'm worried if I ask my son if he would be okay with officially losing his room, he may see it as a rejection. He and I haven't always had a great relationship. I was in the military for the first few years of his life and struggled with drugs and my mental health when I got out. Our relationship seems good now, but I know it's still delicate because he can be very sensitive. I would assure him that he's still welcome to stay as much as he wants. WIBTA if I ask him? Or should I just keep letting the girls use the space as it is until he brings it up or gets a more permanent place of his own?",Asshole,2024-08-12,"WIBTA for turning my son's bedroom into a guest room?

166,1epzo0v,AITA for Not Letting My Friend Bring Her New Boyfriend to My Birthday Party?,"I (24F) have a close-knit group of friends, and we’ve known each other since high school. Every year, we make a big deal out of birthdays, and this year, I was excited to host a small dinner party at my apartment for my 25th. I invited all of my friends, but made it clear that I wanted it to be just us—no plus-ones, so we could have a more intimate gathering.

One of my friends, Emily (25F), recently started dating someone new, and she’s been talking about him non-stop. A few days before the party, she asked if she could bring him along. I felt awkward because I don’t really know him, and I didn’t want to change the dynamic of the group for my birthday. I told her that I wanted to keep it just the girls, as originally planned, and that I hope she understands.

Emily seemed a bit annoyed and said she might not come at all if she couldn’t bring him. I told her I’d miss her if she didn’t come, but I understood if she chose not to. On the day of the party, she didn’t show up, and I found out later through another friend that she was upset with me for not being ‘supportive’ of her new relationship.

Now I’m wondering if I was too rigid and if I should have just let her bring him.

167,1epzg3n,AITA for telling my mother something about my Step-Father’s family that sparked a huge argument?,"Be mindful this is my first post in this subreddit, so I apologize for any bad formatting.

So my Mother (47), Stepfather (51), and me (15f) a few days ago went to my Stepfather’s dad’s funeral. Which is a very hard time for him, so I understand why he may be on edge or upset in general. 

Also just know that I’m am no stranger to arguments, as my mother and bio dad frequently had arguments that lead to screaming and throwing things. But, this argument felt too familiar to the ones that lead up to my mother’s and bio dad’s divorce.

Either way back to the title. Me and my mother are not close with my stepfather’s family as we live a few hours away. So when it came to the funeral it was very awkward for us two to be there but we wanted to support my stepfather so we went anyway. The whole thing was mostly fine even though I didn’t talk to many people there. The thing that started this whole argument was so stupid, honestly. My stepsister (19f) wanted to sign a softball that would be put in her grandfathers casket. Most people signed it the night before but it never got to her. Because of this I offered to run to the car and get her a pen that I brought (thank god I did because she did get to sign it before it went in the casket).

So while I was on the way to the car a man stopped me and asked me something along the lines of, “Oh, are you [nickname]?” In response I nodded with a smile, “Yeah, well [full name].” (To clarify why I had told my full name was because someone else on my stepfather’s side of the family has the same nickname.) After that I told him to excuse me so I could get to the car behind him. This is when I heard someone say “Well she’s *not our* [nickname].” And then proceeded to mention something along the lines of me ‘getting into the car’ when I was just trying to get my stepsister a pen. 

Now in all fairness she might have meant it in a clarifying way but her tone of voice just sounded indifferent. Either way I grabbed the pen, locked the car, and went to give my stepsister the pen. I didn’t mention this to my mother till later that night when we were alone because, of course that hurt my feelings because I have been nothing but nice and respectful to my stepfather’s family.

I ignored that interaction till we got home. At around 9:30 I told my mother when my stepfather went to sleep. I mentioned that it wasn’t a huge deal, but I wanted to tell someone to get it off my chest because, again, it hurt my feelings.

Now we’re all caught back up to the present, they haven’t talked and tension can be cut with a knife in the house. So I can’t help but feel bad and like an asshole for the whole situation. If I never told my mom the argument wouldn’t have happened. So AITA?

(Sorry if there’s any typos.)

Small edit: I just wanna add that I never thought my mother would go confront my stepfather about the situation the next afternoon as it had nothing to do with him specifically, and that she always tells me conversations about feelings or anything like that will stay between us two. I felt better after the conversation as talking it out with her and I never expected this to become an issue in the first place, again, as I never expected my mom to bring it up to my stepdad.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-12,"AITA for telling my mother something about my Step-Father’s family that sparked a huge argument?
