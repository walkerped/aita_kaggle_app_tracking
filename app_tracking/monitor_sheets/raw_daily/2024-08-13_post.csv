0,1ere2g6,AITA For not lying about/covering up my pregnancy experience to appease my sisters conservative boyfriend?,"Hi all.

Background info; I am a trans man and currently twenty nine. Post op, full beard, male pattern baldness... The works. Have not been sexed as female, disregarding medical situations, since I was a teen. 

I had my son when I was twenty six. Accidental pregnancy and the like but we couldn't face a termination so now he's here. Anyway, my husband and I are proud parents. Kiddo will be three in a few months. We are currently in the process of trying for a second.

My younger sister is twenty three and currently dating a guy she met at college. He is conservative and as such my sister worked very carefully to make sure he did not know about my transition.

A few weeks ago she finally introduced him to us. He's a pretty nice guy and was great with my son. He assumed he was adopted, made a comment about how much he looks like the both of us, asked if we had any photos of his birth parents for comparison. 

I corrected him - just told him that he's not adopted, we are the bio parents, etc. He was confused but didn't ask for any further explanation from us. He did quiz my sister who tried to cover it up by telling him that our son doesn't know he's adopted and we're trying to avoid him becoming curious.

He, the boyfriend, was then pretty upset and decided to confront me about it. Very stereotypical ""this is why people don't want the gays adopting"" type rant. Mostly fuelled by his own distaste for his (adoptive) parents, we weren't too upset or anything. But I was annoyed with my sister.

I was, originally, going to keep my transition quiet from him as she'd asked just to keep the peace. However, because she decided to paint us as some crazed adoptive gays, I told him the truth - in a relatively crude way, but, honestly, a lot of people need it that way to understand. 

Paraphrasing, but it was something along the lines of, ""Sorry, [sister] lied. He's not adopted. I used to be a chick, have a vagina, gave birth. Bitch at her, not us."" 

He was kind of confused at first and ended up leaving. Their relationship is now a lot rockier. I don't know if it's because of her lying or him finding out about my transition or not. She's claiming the latter.

My sister is extremely upset with me - I agreed to not tell him and did anyway. I told her that I agreed to not tell him, yes, but I didn't agree to let him think our kid is adopted when he isn't (and especially not allow him to think that we're some crazy gays trying to convince our son two cocks can make a baby).

Parents are siding with her, saying we knew he would react badly and we want to destroy her relationship (her ex left her when he found out I was trans for some reason).

I really don't think I overstepped too much, but on the othe hand, I fully understand why she's upset.

I was talking to my husband about it and he was like, this would be funny on AITA, so here we are.

1,1erad9c,UPDATE: AITA for telling my vet tech roommate she's a bad pet owner,"To everyone who posted judgements I appreciate your feedback and have considered everything while moving forward in our conflict. I do recall a couple people wanting an update so here it is. It's really not exciting though.

My roommate and I are not speaking, between the issues with her cat and a few other household related issues that have transpired since posting she and I are simply cohabitating and only speaking when absolutely necessary. I have found a new apartment which I will be moving into in 6 weeks and while my rent will go up, so will my peace of mind and capacity for relaxation. I wish I knew what was going to happen to the roommates cat, but I don't know, and I admittedly worry about it. He's a good cat, and I hope whatever happens after I leave, that he has a good long life.

My mental health, and the wellness of my cat who is prone to stress related illness and has a few chronic health issues of his own, means this decision to move out and leave this mess behind is the best thing I can do for the fur baby and I.

Roommate has since (prior to going full silent treatment) admitted to not being able to afford her cats vet care and that contributed to his delayed care. I have mixed feelings about that because I understand how unaffordable vet care can be, but I can't understand why someone would save nothing for vet bills if they were going to adopt a high needs animal with several medical issues. I told her this, I'm certain it's part of why she won't speak to me. We pay well below market rate for our rental, so we both have significant expendable income right now, but she cannot afford vet care and that to me seems careless. However, this is an issue I'm accepting will never be understood or resolved, not at least while I'm around.

As for my kitty, he's having a dental issues, which I knew was coming as the vet warned me during his dental extractions 4 years ago it would like eventually resurface. He has a checkup tomorrow, and hopefully he doesn't need more extractions, but if he does we'll get him what he needs and book him in, though I am hoping it doesn't require that level of treatment, as I don't want to put him through that recovery again.

I wish I had more exciting news, there's really nothing special to report. Her and I aren't on speaking terms, she's spending even more time out of the house to avoid me, her cat is fine (for now), my cat is not fine (for now), and overall I am doing good knowing in six weeks me and my furball are free of her forever. I will be losing her contact information and never speaking to her again as soon as myself, my belongings and my cat are out of this apartment.

There won't be any further updates or information because as far as I am concerned this chapter is closed. I'm just coasting through until I get the keys to my new place.

Thank you for your support, feedback and kind words...

2,1ermvmd,WIBTA if I let my dad know that my mum just told me he isn’t my biological father? ,"I’m 43 years old. My parents divorced when I was 5. My mum raised me. Growing up, I would stay with my dad for a week in the summer. He wasn’t ever much of a father. 

However, I have a relationship with him. Our relationship has dealt with him not being a good dad, and we’ve moved past that as adults. We get on quite well. 

Recently, I started wondering if he’s actually my biological father as I look nothing like him. 

I raised this with my dad the last time he visited when we’re hanging out drinking some beers. He said when my mum and him were younger, they used to attend some weird version of swinger parties. He told my to ask her about (insert dude’s name). I asked him the guy’s name a few days later, as I had forgotten, but he pretended he didn’t know what I was talking about.

Currently, my mum is visiting my wife and me. We had a few drinks the other night and I basically told here all the above. She said nothing. The next morning, she sat me down and basically admitted she had slept with someone else, got pregnant with me, and told my dad I was his kid.

She tells me my biological father was a Naval officer and denied knowledge of the swinger parties. Told me she didn’t remember his name. She told me not to tell anyone, especially not my dad. I told her I wouldn’t tell anyone.

3,1ermkzj,AITA for wanting my neighbor to not put up a flag in the middle of the river?,"Very weird situation that's hard to relate to something else, so I'll explain the situation the best I can. Please bear with me. 

  
I live in a neighborhood with houses next to the river. I have neighbors on both sides of me that are also next to the river. Sometimes when the river is low, there is a rock that is exposed in the middle of the river. My neighbor has taken it upon himself to place an American flag on that exposed rock in the middle of the river. He doesn't own the rock, and he definitely doesn't own the river. 

  
From every single view of my house, I can see the flag in the middle of the river. I've tried tuning it out, but I just can't. One of the reasons I bought my house was so I could view the river, trees, and natural wildlife that comes as part of living next to a river. However, now every time I look outside I just see the flag in the middle of the river. 

  
I want to make it clear that I have no issue with the American Flag by itself. I'll admit that I'm not exactly the most staunch patriot, but if someone wants to fly an American Flag outside their home, I have absolutely no issue with that at all. Even if this flag in the middle of the river said that I was the king of the world and everybody should listen to me, I still wouldn't want the flag put there because again - it should not be in the middle of the river. 

  
The reason he put the flag there is so he could mark the rock so that he doesn't hit it with his boat/jetski - which I can understand. However, it's not like he can't go in a completely different direction and avoid the rock that he knows is there. There is miles of river in the other direction that he could boat/jetski in that don't have exposed rocks for him to run into. However for some reason, he feels it necessary to boat/jetski in circles in our ""shared"" backyard on the river, and thus, the flag. 

  
I've asked him to take it down and he immediately got defensive and offended that I'd even ask because he feels that it's not an issue, and that I'm ""attacking the American flag/being anti-American"", and he has no intention of taking it down. I've contacted various state departments, the police, the VFW, the American Legion, and none of them have helped - every single person says it's not in their jurisdiction and that they can't do anything about it. 

  
Outside of my own personal reasons for not wanting the flag there, it's also very disrespectful to the flag itself, as it does not follow proper flag code for the American flag. So even through my own admittedly selfish reasons, it's also just generally disrespectful to be using an American flag as a marker for where an exposed rock is in the middle of the river. 

  
I really, really, REALLY don't want to see that flag in the middle of the river until the end of time.

7,1erlkju,WIBTA if I chose to not attend 8 year old nieces small birthday gathering tonight because of her behavior?,"My sister had an unplanned pregnancy when she was in Uni, 8 years ago. The dad comes from a wealthy family and is in and out of the picture as he pleases. Doesnt support financially. My mom and I have always helped out as much as we can with their apartment but also helping pick niece up from school, babysitting, taking her to her after school programs, helping with homework, ect. All the stuff my sister struggles to do as a single parent. 

My sisters parenting is horrible. She has no consequences for my niece, raised her on an ipad, and does nothing about my nieces defiance, rudeness, and constantly antagonistic behavior. Her answer to everything is “stop (niece), (niece) you know that’s not nice, (niece) please stop” repeated 50x while my niece laughs hysterically because it’s funny and she knows nothing will happen. Shes different when shes alone with me, and acts a lot better because Ive taught her she needs to do things right before I can give her ice cream/TV/ect.

 I had an argument with my sister for the first time ever last month during a weekend trip about this, and her response was that she’s a child, I’m an adult, I need to understand that. I yelled that kids learn with consequences and that she’s not going to one day just decide to act right. This started because I finally got visably angry that as per usual my niece was calling people names, throwing things, and doing things like ripping my book from my hands while I was reading and trying to throw it in the pool. Nothing happened to provoke this, she just thinks it’s funny to make people angry.

I went home and I told my mom, crying, that I was over it, I couldn’t take it any more, and that I wasn’t going to her birthday party - Which was like a 8 person thing.

My mom said that it’s cruel, and that I need to show up for my niece because we’re all she has. That my niece acts up because she’s a child who’s constantly abandoned by her father and has an emotionally unstable single mom that doesn’t know how to parent and ends up resorting to yelling at her when she loses her temper.

I went home and I told my mom, crying, that I was over it, I couldn’t take it any more, and that I wasn’t going to her birthday party - Which was like a 8 person thing. Clearly none of the love and attention that I’ve tried to give has done anything to help her, but it has made me absolutely miserable and serves as a devastating reminder of my sisters terrible life choices. My mom said that it’s cruel, and that I need to show up for my niece because we’re all she has. That my niece acts up because she’s a child who’s constantly abandoned by her father and has an emotionally unstable single mom that doesn’t know how to parent and ends up resorting to yelling at her when she loses her temper. I said I dont care anymore. Am I being an irrational asshole?",0.0,0.0023068867158144712,0,1

9,1erkwfq,AITA for calling my girlfriend dramatic?,"My girlfriend (21f let's call her Jill) and I (22f) know each other since elementary school. We always had a common hobby: gaming. At first we played many video games together but it turned out that she's really bad at video games so I stopped playing games with her, except for Final Fantasy 14 because even she is able to do the casual content with one of the easier classes.

So in Final Fantasy 14 we are in an FC (the equivalent of a guild in other MMOs) together with a few of my ingame friends. We want to recruit more members so we decided to advertise our FC on the FF14 website. For that, we wanted to make a picture with all our members.

There is currently a summer event in FF14 which also involves a tower that is a jump puzzle. I suggested to do the picture on top of the tower and everyone thought it was a very good idea, for Jill. She said she hates jump puzzles but since everyone else wanted to do the picture on the tower, we decided to do it. So we started to climb the tower. It's not easy but it's definitely possible. It took most of us like 30 minutes to get up there.

However, Jill had problems to get to the top. When all of us except her were on the top, she said to do the picture without her because she didn't think she would make it. But we wanted everyone to be on the picture so we continued waiting. After **three hours** a few of us became a bit impatient and told her to hurry. 

After 30 more minutes Jill almost made it but then jumped past a platform and landed at the bottom of the tower. One of our FC members, Alex, lost it and told her that she's a ""f\*cking failure"". I didn't say anything because he's not wrong (though I would never tell her that because I don't want to hurt her feelings and she already thinks so little of herself), because she isn't good in anything. Like I said, she isn't good at video gaming and that does apply to all her other hobbies. She loves writing but she's bad at it, she likes horse riding, but she's bad at it and she's bad at her job.

After Alex said that, she immediately left the Discord voice chat and logged out of the game so we ended up doing the picture without her after we waited for almost 4 hours. After we finished, I texted her and asked what was wrong. She texted me back that Alex and the others really hurt her for being impatient and deciding to do the picture on the top even though they know that she's bad at jump puzzles.

I told her she's being dramatic and that the others were right because she wasted everyones time and that she acted like a child. She's ghosting me since then. I kinda feel like an asshole but my friends say that I'm not and that Jill should get thicker skin.

10,1erktlc,AITA for refusing to let someone merge on to my lane and almost causing an accident.,"I live and work in a city that is notorious for its traffic, and I have to commute 30+ minutes to the office 4 days a week. Part of my commute involves a left turn at a traffic light where the is only one left turn lane, which usually has a backup of 20-30 cars in the morning.

This morning, after waiting in line for and completing that left turn, there were signs that in about 200 feet (60 m) the road was going to go down to one lane. Most of the cars including myself kept in a single file line since we already were in a line due to waiting to turn left at the previous light. One car well behind me in line decided to whip into the other lane that was ending, and went full speed all the way up to the point where the cones were blocking off the lane that was ending.

Then at that point, they stopped but tried to immediately force their way in line directly in front of me without warning. I honked at them, which only made them stop for a second before they tried pulling in front of me again. Where I may be the AH, is that I sped up to cut them off, nearly causing us to wreck, and they ended up having to stop at this last second to avoid a collision and then had to pull in behind me, though they let me know by honking how upset they were.

My reasoning for not letting the other car in is that everybody in that line had already had to wait their turn just to turn left at the long light, and I felt it was unfair for somebody to try and cut their way in front of everyone else when we all had to get in another slow line to get through the 1 lane section of the road. I feel completely justified for refusing to let them merge, but I'm less sure that I'm completely innocent in this when I almost caused an accident to block them. So AITA ?

  
Edit: I would like to clarify for everyone who suggested this was a situation where zipper merging should be used, the left turn at this intersection is marked so that everyone making the turn should have been in the left lane after the turn, and then the right lane was going to end in 200 ft, so the other car specifically changed lanes and sped up to get ahead of other people. 

However, after reading through the comments, while the other person was an AH, I agree that me driving recklessly just to get back at them was an AH move. This road was pretty congested,  and so at the slow speeds we were going (20-25 mph) a lethal accident was extremely unlikely, however an accident could have caused property damage and possibly minor injuries for not only myself, but other innocent drivers behind me, so I accept any YTA/ESH judgements.",Asshole,2024-08-13,"AITA for refusing to let someone merge on to my lane and almost causing an accident.

11,1erksle,AITA for defending my boyfriend's feelings to my own mom?,"I, 37F and my mom 70F have always been close as she is a single mom and I am her only child. My mom has always had very particular triggers due to having a very difficult childhood with toxic/abusive parents.

Some of the main ones are getting super offended when offered leftovers or people taking her food due to growing up poor and being offered scraps only after her parents ate.

3 years ago, my mom was visiting and we went to a sushi dinner with my boyfriend (Noel 37M), his dad, stepmom, and my stepdaughter (8F). When ordering appetizers, my mom misunderstood and ordered her entrees too. When all of her food started coming out, I could tell she was embarrassed and said ""Help yourselves"". I KNEW she didn't mean it but felt she had to say it. When we were almost done, Noel's stepmom offered some leftover pieces to my stepchild. I immediately knew my mom was pissed. Later on, she brought it up in private and asked me ""Just because they were treating us to dinner she thinks she can take my food?"" I reminded her that she told everyone to help themselves. She brushed me off and stayed mad.

Recently, my mom was visiting again. Noel, my mom, and I were sitting in the living room when my mom randomly says, ""Noel, just so you know, I don't like your stepmom"". I was MORTIFIED & explained what happened. Again, she brushed me off. Noel told me later that he was hurt by what my mom said. I understood and said I would address it knowing my mom wouldn't take it well.

2 months later, I was talking to my mom on the phone and I finally had the guys to bring it up. I told her that Noel was hurt by what was said as his stepmom has been in his life for over 20 years and to please not talk bad about her in front of him because they are family. My mom asked, ""Well was he HURT when she snatched my food from me and told me 'You can order something ELSE'. I reminded her that I was sitting next to her that was not said. My mom said she didn't want to talk to me anymore and hung up.

The next day, I texted her good morning like I always do and told her I understand she probably won't be speaking to me for a while but that I love her. The response I got was ""I don't give a fuck how much you love me. You have your chosen family so be happy with them and leave me the fuck alone. I don't want to hear anything about you and your family!!!""I wasn't even that shocked when I got it, to be honest. I thought we would go maybe a week without talking and she would reach out but she blocked me on everything and it's been 4 months. She didn't even contact me to tell me our family dog died! I'm so hurt and tired. I believe she is waiting for me to be the first to reach out but I haven't as I feel like I am the one who deserves an apology. 

I recently started seeing a new therapist who said I should have validated her feelings more about the dinner and now I am wondering if I'm in the wrong.

So my(f20) best friend(f22) moved in with me recently because she broke up with her babydaddy, and she needed some time to get back on her feet. I told her she can move in with me if she pays half the rent. She has twins about a year and a half old. I do not get along with her ex at all. He cheated on her multiple times, has no sense of fatherhood hasn’t been there or contributed at all in the twins’ lives. Tried to cheat on her WITH ME, and tried to fight my boyfriend when i rejected him for obvious reasons. Basically my only rule is that the bd is not to be in the apartment because i don’t trust him. He is also known for stealing. 

I left with my mother today around 10am to help clean her house and told my friend I wouldn’t be back until the evening. My mom got tired doing yard work around 1:30pm and she said to call it a day and she took me home early. I come home to see her bd on the couch. My friend comes running out begging for forgiveness that its just for a little bit that he wants to see the babies, he wants to try to work things out. I was like cool. Get out. Go to a hotel or something you know the rules. Im going to the bank, if he’s still here when i come back you can pack your things too bc im over it. She cried really hard to forgive her shes just in a bad spot and doesn’t know what to do. I told her i don’t mind what her decisions are, but i don’t want him in the apartment it was my only rule. You didn’t even try asking me. I went to the bank and they left before i got back. I feel bad for making her cry. Maybe i should have been more calm?

The heart attack happened friday night btw. I got to school monday morning (she was still in the hospital) and i went to my math class. I was extremely down that day and was just kinda keeping to myself. Class starts and my teachers asks for everyone's homework. I then realized i didn't do it.

I don't remember exactly what he said but it was something to the extent of ""you've had all weekend to do it why didn't you do like everyone else?"" I kinda just snapped and started yelling saying ""my mom almost deleted this weekend do you really think i would have my homework done??""

17,1erjxgy,AITA for giving a kitten and asking him back?,"Me (F) and my friend (F) live on a farm and take care of animals. Our only female cat had kittens in June. As we have several cats already and didn't want to be 'crazy cat ladies', we had decided not to keep any of the babies. That was of course before meeting them.

One of the kittens was born very different than the others (white, big and with a loud meow) and was clearly his mama's favourite. My friend and I were both very fond of him and adored seeing him shadow his mom everywhere and their special relationship. He was the first one we named. We were both silently thinking of keeping him.

Fast forward all their cuteness and our love for them growing, we are looking for families for them.

People came to our house because we were taking care of their dog. One of the kittens liked the dog and went everywhere with him, so naturally we offered them to take her. They thought about it and agreed. So far so good.

They came back for her after a week, which left us a good time to say our goodbyes and let go of the 1st baby, as planned. When they came they saw the special white cat. And immediately said they wanted him as well. They said he looked like an expensive cat and that people in their country would pay 1500e for this cat. These comments made me uncomfortable. They also were not interested in hearing anything about their birth or to know small facts about them. We said he was promised to someone, they insisted. My friend was seemingly up for giving him. I was surprised but also knew of our previous decision when our cat got pregnant. We tried to think logically rather than with our hearts. My friend however mentioned to the people that we had a 'one week return policy' she said it laughingly but also told them she was serious about it. I did not want to give him but did not want to go against my friend. I regretted it. I felt very pressured and pushed in my own house to make a decision on the spot. I was not strong enough to impose a no on everyone. The people left with both cats. Turned out my friend also deeply and instantly regretted it. We talked about it between us.

He asked me for drinks one night with his friends and I answered and said sure I’ll join, 2 hours later he didn’t tell me which bar and so I called. He didn’t answer and said he still needed to shower and I said ok hope it’s before midnight then as I’m getting tired. No response even though he was online one hour later, he completely messed me around, never texted and never apologised. 

After my birthday he said he needs to buy me a birthday coffee one evening. He was late to the meeting, changed the meeting place, brought two other random friends along and spent the entire evening on the phone to 3 different people about unimportant topics. When he was off the phone finally, he was just walking with one of the friends and not speaking to me. The only time he did speak was to take the mic out of me buying a chocolate bar and said “oh course you would buy the most sugary thing here” and laughed.

I felt hurt. He knew he had done wrong and sent me a text saying “hey was nice to see you sorry I got caught up in three phone calls ans we didn’t get chance to talk properly. We shall meet again soon!” 

The apology felt poor and if you really wanted to make it up to your friend, you wouldn’t apologise like that or even behave like that after bailing on the drinks and poor reply after grandma died. 

He texted me now whilst I’m on vacation saying “where are you on vacation then? I moved to your office so looking forward to lunches when you are back. Come back soon”

19,1erjceo,AITA for making my GF open the door for me instead of using my keys?,"A bit of backstory - My GF (32F) and I (26M) have our own separate apartments. We both have keys to each other's place but she rarely uses hers. I’d say 1 out of 20 times she uses her keys. All the other times she either texts me that she’s outside, or the front door was already propped open by a neighbor. It doesn’t bother me a ton, it's just inconvenient at times. Especially when I’m busy doing something, or I’m playing with some friends and have my headphones on. Then she spams my phone and when I finally open the door I ask where her keys are and why she didn’t use them. She usually just brushes off my question. Recently she texted me that she was outside while I was showering. I told her I'd be out when I’m done. Instead of grabbing her keys from her car where she keeps them, she decided to wait outside till I was done. When I finally opened the door, she goes on about how hot it was outside. I AGAIN ask her where her keys are and of course she brushes it off. I tell her that from now on, I won’t use the keys I have for her place. She tells me to calm down and continues to brush it off. Since then there’s been 3 times that I haven’t used my keys and instead used the apartment's buzzer. The first 2 times there was no reaction at all. The 3rd time is the reason for this post.

Now to last night. I had to take her to the airport early in the morning, so she tells me to sleep over. After getting everything I needed to get done for the day, I head to her place and got there at around 9pm. Of course, like I promised, I didn’t use my keys. She opens the door pissed and as I walk in she goes

Are you serious?

Me: Yea?

She then blows up and tells me what I did was very malicious and cruel because I had my keys and intentionally didn’t use them to be petty. She then goes on to say that if she acted as childish as I did that she wouldn’t go anywhere in life. I tell her that by her logic I can think of many times where the same applies to her. We go back and forth for a while till I realize how stupid the reason for arguing was. I get the feeling we were still arguing because she wanted an apology, but I just tell her that I’ll use my keys next time and I get ready for bed on the couch

20,1erj2gr,AITA for selling an expensive gift?,"I’m a female who was 19 at the time of this story, and this male was 20. I had just started a job at a movie theatre. There was a guy in the same orientation as me. I’ll call him Barry. He developed a crush super fast. I thought he was cute as well. For a few days we flirted a little bit at work but it was casual. 

After a week of knowing Barry, he wanted me to be his girlfriend. I told him that I had just gotten out of a long relationship (which was true), and wasn’t ready to date. He was persistent and I told him it would be better if we were just friends for now. He said ok, but he would still always find ways to be near me at work. After his shifts were over Barry would wait around until my shifts ended so that we could hangout more. A manager asked him to stop. 

We remained friends for a little bit. At one point I told him I was interested in photography as a hobby. I say this because it is relevant. After a short time of this going on, I decided that Barry and I couldn’t be friends because it wasn’t fair to him if I couldn’t bring myself to date him. 

Around the time that I was composing how I would let him down easy, he randomly turned up with a gift for me. It was a $600 camera. I told Barry that I would not accept this because we had only known each other a few weeks and that he needed to return it, but he refused. 

He started coming on even stronger and would not leave me alone even if I requested. Once he almost fought a customer at the theater because he thought that this customer had looked at me inappropriately. Not even a comment, just a look. He nearly fist-fought this dude over it. Finally I told Barry that it wasn’t a good idea for us to be friends since we had different wants and I just wasn’t the person for him. His behavior got even more intense and alarming. I told him to take the camera back, he did not take it. 

He started begging, over text and in person. We had only known each other a month now. He was very intense. I had finally found another job so I quit the theater and was planning on cutting ties with him because there was nothing else I could do. I told him again to take the camera, he told me he never wanted that camera back. 

I thought about dropping off the camera at his place but refrained from going near his apartment. Having the camera reminded me of him, and I wanted to move on. 

Without Barry taking the camera back and with me not wanting it in my possession, I ended up selling it. I got about $400. I considered putting this money in an envelope and mailing it to him, but I didn’t know the apartment number by heart. I found his sister (that he lived with) on Facebook and asked her if I could mail it to him. She told me that he had joined the army and doesn’t live with her anymore.

22,1erim7u,AITA for shutting down an emotional conversation with my fiancé?,"My fiancé and I got into a minor argument this morning, that resulted in an incredibly lengthy conversation about tons of behaviours of mine that he had not been satisfied with over the past months. He addressed situations that I had already forgotten about because they were so long ago and told me about fears and insecurities that he's had about me/our relationships for months, but had never told me about before (apparently he had developed a fear of ""having expectations in me"" months ago, because of one situation I had already forgotten about, amongst other things).

He also expected me to analyze whether his fears/insecurities are reasonable and wanted me to help him find out whether he was making up some of the problems by getting too worked up about things and overthinking them. I am not a therapist, especially not his therapist, so I refused to do so.

At some point we both decided we had worked through the pressing issues, we're both satisfied with the outcome and wanted to enjoy the rest of the day. We spent quality time together, talked and laughed normally and everything was fine.

Until I went to walk our dog, because I have to get up early tomorrow. He asked whether he could join and I said ""sure!"" (hadn't asked him because he was busy working on a project and I didn't want to interrupt). We talked about our future together first and everything was light-hearted, until he decided to drop another bombshell: He felt like I had purposely not asked him to join me on the walk to ""show him that I don't need him"".
I asked him why I should do that and that I thought everything was fine between us, but he was convinced I was holding a grudge against him.

After almost an hour of talking, I went quiet. He asked me what I was thinking and I told him that I had expected to have a nice, calm evening and that I had to go to bed early, but now I was in a state of emotional turmoil due to that hefty conversation that came out of nowhere. I told him conversations like these (they mostly consist of me having to reassure him and promise to him that I am not holding grudges or trying to hurt him purposely - it's exhausting. It's mostly about him and his emotions and whenever I bring up a good point that counters his anxiety his reply is something along the lines of: ""So you think I am overreacting and the entire situation is my fault?"") weren't good for me before bed, because I had trouble falling asleep after them in the past and I needed to get up early tomorrow.

At some point we both decided we had worked through the pressing issues, we're both satisfied with the outcome and wanted to enjoy the rest of the day. We spent quality time together, talked and laughed normally and everything was fine.

Until I went to walk our dog, because I have to get up early tomorrow. He asked whether he could join and I said ""sure!"" (hadn't asked him because he was busy working on a project and I didn't want to interrupt). We talked about our future together first and everything was light-hearted, until he decided to drop another bombshell: He felt like I had purposely not asked him to join me on the walk to ""show him that I don't need him"".
I asked him why I should do that and that I thought everything was fine between us, but he was convinced I was holding a grudge against him.

After almost an hour of talking, I went quiet. He asked me what I was thinking and I told him that I had expected to have a nice, calm evening and that I had to go to bed early, but now I was in a state of emotional turmoil due to that hefty conversation that came out of nowhere. I told him conversations like these (they mostly consist of me having to reassure him and promise to him that I am not holding grudges or trying to hurt him purposely - it's exhausting. It's mostly about him and his emotions and whenever I bring up a good point that counters his anxiety his reply is something along the lines of: ""So you think I am overreacting and the entire situation is my fault?"") weren't good for me before bed, because I had trouble falling asleep after them in the past and I needed to get up early tomorrow.

My fiancé became really quiet, told me that I should sleep, turned off the light and left the room with his pillow. He has been super quiet and timid since I opened up about how stressful those hour-long conversations are for me.

I chose this life so I save and plan accordingly, and haven’t taken a penny from my (well off) family since years.

Last week, my parents wanted me to travel to them for a family reunion. It’s a slow time work wise and I haven’t worked since the last 3 months. So I told them that this is not a great time for me, and I shouldn’t be spending my savings on last minute expensive flight tickets. I also said it would have been nice if they had checked with me before scheduling this but whatever.

My mom really wanted me to be there so she offered to reimburse me for the tickets later. I wasn’t sure but she got upset so I agreed to fly down.

Apparently, my dad is not happy that my mother offered to pay for the tickets. In the middle of dinner (with me, mom, my elder sister and her husband), he went on this rant about how he always told me not to work in such a volatile industry, and I should be ashamed I’m taking money from my old parents. He went on to add how his parents never lent him any money and how he also wanted to become a photographer but realised that it’s unrealistic.

I argued that I hadn’t taken any money from them since I started working and if it helps, they don’t need to reimburse me for the tickets either.

To which, he started going on about all the years he paid for my school, uni, and basic sustenance. And then he said that I probably couldn’t find work cuz I suck at my job.

At this point, my sister and my mom are trying to calm him down and they almost managed to but here’s why I think I might be TA: his words angered me and I lashed out a little bit, saying that he did what anyone who chooses to reproduce does, and he’s just jealous that I got to follow my passion cuz he didn’t have the guts to.

This was followed by him storming off and me telling everyone that this is why I didn’t want to spend money to just come and fight him.

My brother-in-law is on my side and my mom is neutral. My sister thinks I should have kept my cool because he is our dad after all. As of today, mom has said he has decided to go no-contact with me.

My girlfriend asked if she could put me on her insurance as a second driver as it'll make her insurance cheaper and she doesn't like driving whereas I don't mind it.

I agreed as it wasn't going to cost me anything and saves my gf money and I thought it would be good to drive.

She mentioned last night that she's thinking of getting a new car. I asked why and she just said she wants one and that since I'll be driving it, it'll be cheaper since we'd both be paying towards the car.

I refused as I see need to get a new car. My gf said she'd pay 60% and I could pay 40% but I refused again as I'm only on the insurance now so she can save money and because she doesn't like driving.

He is 2 years old and I would say very clingy to mummy. Most nights he takes about 30 - 40 mins for me to get him to sleep, he won’t go to sleep in his own. When he is poorly, at the moment the last set of molars are coming through, he is off the scale clingy. One handed mummy comes out as he is the little monkey attached to me and when I get him to sleep, he always wakes up when I move so I struggle to get out of his bedroom. He wakes up every half an hour so it’s always a bit tough. 
Now my other half has told me many times, I need to be in there for 10 mins, do the good night routine and kiss him good night and leave the room. Tonight he is absolutely furious with me because it took 2 hours to free myself. He things I should just up and go once he asleep and leave him to cry when he wakes. 
He hasn’t put him to bed ever, not really his fault it’s more mine as I know he doesn’t have the patience for it so I take that burden.

My brother is staying for 7 days. I’m sorry but that feels like a really long trip. I have not seen my brother in over a year. He barely talks to me and is generally very nonchalant towards me. It hurts but i’ve learned to live with it.

35,1erh0vg,AITAH for keeping my daughter away from her grandfather,"AITAH for keeping my daughter away from her grandfather

Long story short my fiancé’s step dad has a drinking problem. We recently had a daughter who’s 17 months and she’s met all of her father’s side of the family. I don’t have much family on my side so for her to be able to see and get to know his family is great. 

The only issue is her grandfather has a major drinking problem. I grew up with an alcoholic father and have no relationship with him what so ever. I don’t want that for my daughter nor do I want her to be around that kind of behavior growing up. 

I don’t know how to bring this up to my fiancé or my soon to be MIL with out seeming like a controlling bitch of a mother. She helps watch our daughter some days during the week and when I travel for work, so she’s a big part of our life and a huge help to us and I don’t want to ruin this relationship between us. I would think he would want to get sober for her sake(both for his wife’s and his granddaughter’s)  and to be around her more but he’s too busy getting drunk to come and visit. It’s not like it’s a beer here and there. He’s been hospitalized and has tried to go through detox and do rehab but he relapse’s and always goes back to drinking. 

So am I the asshole and overreacting for not wanting my daughter to be around her grandfather and potentially banning him until he proves that he can stay sober? 

Edit: I want him to be apart of her life don’t get me wrong but I don’t want him in and out of her life because he can’t get his shit together. If he could have stayed sober the first time and not treat his wife like shit when he drinks then I wouldn’t have even made this post. I want my daughter to have family in her life consistently and not in and out whenever they please. I had that growing up and it sucks. It’s not fun. 

We also live on a couple acres of land and have things around the property that could be dangerous if you’re just fucking around never mind if you’re drunk off your ass. He shouldn’t need to be babysat when he’s over here too. ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-13,"AITAH for keeping my daughter away from her grandfather AITAH for keeping my daughter away from her grandfather

39,1erfw8d,AITA for making my cousins wait 2 hours for me?,"It was a normal day. My mom, brother and I planned to meet our cousins at the beach for the day. Our cousins had already been there for quite a while, and we hadn’t even left yet. My mom was taking forever to get ready. But we finally left, and drove about an hour down to the beach.

We were late but it was only 12:00 so we were fine. We still had the whole day to have fun. We arrived and parked our car at the boardwalk area. We got out of the car, and my mom told my brother and I to unload the car and put all of our stuff into the wagon and then roll it up to the beach. I deviated from this plan and stated that I put on my sunscreen first then I would help them pack after. They wanted me to do it on the beach. I’ll tell you why I don’t like to do it that way. 

1. I like to get it out of the way so I can just enjoy the beach. 2. I don’t like spraying my sunscreen near people on the beach, as it might blow on them, and that’s just rude. 3.  It’s what we always do. Whenever we go to our local amusement park, putting on sunscreen is the first thing we do, so I was kind of confused when my mom suggested that I unload the car first. I didn’t think it was a big deal or that she cared much, so I just went along with putting on my sunscreen. She knows I’ll help after right? 

But apparently she got really mad because she started yelling at me and snatched the sunscreen out of my hands. Apparently I was “stalling and holding up my cousins who were waiting for me”. I asked for it back from her and she wouldn’t budge, in an annoying way I kept repeating “give me the sunscreen” over and over because I was fed up. My brother was helping my mom unload the car and they had almost finished. They were mad at me because I wasn’t helping at all. I was willing to help out if I would be given the sunscreen so I can do what I need to do quickly. I grabbed the sunscreen from the bag and said that I would help them after I’m done putting it on, but they didn’t want to wait for me. So they finish loading the wagon and start walking to the beach without me. 

I felt betrayed. Were they really that inconsiderate? Or was I the true inconsiderate one? Maybe they were in a hurry? To get to my cousins?

40,1erfuoa,"AITAH for not letting my husband be ""right"" during an argument?","So I (26f) and my husband (26m) got into a bit of a fight this morning. It all started when I asked him while he was getting dressed for work why he was wearing cologne. He hasn't worn cologne for a long time now except every great once in a while and I noticed it yesterday but asked today while he was putting it on (when are you supposed to ask why someone is doing something if not during them doing it?)
Now, I was not accusing him not have I EVER accused him of cheating on me. But he responded with ""work has a meeting the other day and personal hygiene was a topic so I just wanted to keep up with that. Why? You think I'm cheating? You think /I/ have time to cheat on you?"" I just said wow and didn't say anything else. 

Well he left for work and I semt my usual ""morning text"" consisting of me saying how much I love and appreciate him and how I'm so proud of how hard he works ECT. And he responses and one of them was him apologizing for answering my question ""wrong"" (?) and i explained why i got upset with his response and that I was sorry for asking. Well that caused an even bigger fight and he ended up saying that ""more than once in this conversation i gave him backhanded apologies, something along the lines of sorry for telling you how I feel."" So I went back through the messages and ""replied"" to several apologies of mine that were in no way shape or form ""backhanded"" and used his apology stating ""I'm sorry your feelings are hurt"" as a (so not like this) example. After sending those replies I said ""so I don't get accused of ignoring you, I have to change the baby"" (because every time he's mad if I stop replying fast enough usually because I'm dealing with our 7 month old he accuses me of ignoring him saying ""don't you dare ignore me"") and he said ""don't fucking bother""
I asked why exactly he was mad, was it because I proved my innocence against an allegation of something I didn't do or because I was using more logic in our fight because I'm usually ""too emotional"" and all he has to say was ""just leave me alone""

So, AITAH? Or is he just pissy because he got proved wrong after talking about how he tries to be fair while we argue and I said he cares more about being right?",TL;DR,2024-08-13,"AITAH for not letting my husband be ""right"" during an argument? So I (26f) and my husband (26m) got into a bit of a fight this morning. It all started when I asked him while he was getting dressed for work why he was wearing cologne. He hasn't worn cologne for a long time now except every great once in a while and I noticed it yesterday but asked today while he was putting it on (when are you supposed to ask why someone is doing something if not during them doing it?)
Now, I was not accusing him not have I EVER accused him of cheating on me. But he responded with ""work has a meeting the other day and personal hygiene was a topic so I just wanted to keep up with that. Why? You think I'm cheating? You think /I/ have time to cheat on you?"" I just said wow and didn't say anything else. 

Well he left for work and I semt my usual ""morning text"" consisting of me saying how much I love and appreciate him and how I'm so proud of how hard he works ECT. And he responses and one of them was him apologizing for answering my question ""wrong"" (?) and i explained why i got upset with his response and that I was sorry for asking. Well that caused an even bigger fight and he ended up saying that ""more than once in this conversation i gave him backhanded apologies, something along the lines of sorry for telling you how I feel."" So I went back through the messages and ""replied"" to several apologies of mine that were in no way shape or form ""backhanded"" and used his apology stating ""I'm sorry your feelings are hurt"" as a (so not like this) example. After sending those replies I said ""so I don't get accused of ignoring you, I have to change the baby"" (because every time he's mad if I stop replying fast enough usually because I'm dealing with our 7 month old he accuses me of ignoring him saying ""don't you dare ignore me"") and he said ""don't fucking bother""
I asked why exactly he was mad, was it because I proved my innocence against an allegation of something I didn't do or because I was using more logic in our fight because I'm usually ""too emotional"" and all he has to say was ""just leave me alone""

So, AITAH? Or is he just pissy because he got proved wrong after talking about how he tries to be fair while we argue and I said he cares more about being right?",,0.9926447868347168,1,0
41,1erfumw,WIBTA for not taking face value for concert tickets?,"I bought tickets for a Taylor Swift concert last year for her concert this year. (More than a year in advance). I have since become pregnant and will be too close to my due date for me to feel safe going, so I’ve decided not to go anymore. I figured I’d just sell my ticket and maybe make a bit of money to spend on baby stuff we still need. 

Looking online, these tickets are currently going for 15-20x the price I paid for it. Like $2000-$3000 for one. Would be amazing but I also don’t like the culture of scalping tickets so I wasn’t exactly looking for that much, but a bit of a profit would be amazing for our family. 

A friend asked me if I would sell it to a friend of hers and after talking with her she offered me $150. Like barely covering what I paid for it originally. Would I be the asshole to say no?

I get that it covers what I paid for it so I end up basically coming out even. But I kinda feel like my time has to be worth something? I had to have that day off work, had to sign up for the presale, had to wait in queues for 5+ hours and pay for everything up front over a year in advance. And then now a couple months before the concert they get the same seats for an AMAZING deal with absolutely no effort? I can’t tell if I’m just being greedy wanting more or if it’s bad for me to play into the scalper mentality of taking advantage of the situation and trying to get as much money as possible, but at the same time isn’t it entirely stupid to accept $150 when I could get literal thousands by just saying no?

Our story takes place on one of my days off. I usually sleep all day and up all night to help stay awake at work. The problem is that i dont get much cleaning done.

 Today when i said she has to come back tonight because they are doing inspection tomorrow and she needs to help clean she said ""nuh-uh i cant, i just cant."" and hung up on me.

44,1erff7m,AITA for messaging my baby dads gf?,So for context I was 27 weeks pregnant when this happened. I started dating my bd back In November 2023. We moved pretty fast and I was practically living with him by the end of the month with how often I was there. I had my everyday items there and would rarely go home. We’re exclusive (or so I thought) and I ended up finding out I was pregnant in March 2024. Got pregnant super fast unintentionally and when I decided to keep the pregnancy we started having problems. We were off and on up until I was 26 weeks pregnant. When I was about 24 weeks pregnant he gave me herpes and I kept finding other women’s stuff at his house. He denied and denied sleeping with anyone else and said the stuff was his first baby moms. I had also found a pill bottle with a name on it that definitely wasn’t his baby moms. We argued and he avoided hanging out for a few days and when I come over again the next morning I find two used condoms in his trash. I text him saying damn dude. Then he calls me twice which I reject as I’m grabbing my shit from his house. The third time he calls I answer and tell him I found the condoms and he starts screaming at me. He tells me to gtfo and he doesn’t want to try and work on things with me. He calls again after I had left him telling me he still wanted to be involved with baby and to keep him updated. About a week passes and I try and call him and I’m blocked. I go to his Fb and it says new post and the new post is a relationship status saying he’s been in a relationship since august 2023… before we started dating. No one is tagged so I then go to his instagram which is now private and he’s tagged a women who’s name was on the pill bottle with hearts. Go to her page and it says they’re dating. I message her telling her I’m 27 weeks pregnant with his child and from what I’ve seen they’ve been dating since before I even met him. She messages back wanting proof which I send her screenshots and she tells me pretty much I’m lying and he wouldn’t leave someone having his child.. when I got pregnant I was with this man everyday. Oh she also asked what proof I had that this was his baby. I send all the proof I have that I was at his house daily and this girl is straight delulu. She ended up blocking me which it’s whatever.

45,1erfdh7,AITA for not inviting my sister to my wedding because of her service dog?,"
My (27F) wedding is coming up in a few months, and it’s supposed to be a big, elegant affair. My fiancé (29M) and I have been planning it for over a year, and we’ve spared no expense. The venue we chose is stunning but also very strict on rules, particularly regarding pets, due to its historical nature. They’ve made it clear that no animals are allowed on the property except for legitimate service animals.

Here’s where the issue comes in: My sister (25F) has severe anxiety and a psychiatric service dog, a Golden Retriever named Max, who helps her with panic attacks and other symptoms. Max is highly trained and well-behaved, but he’s still a dog, and the venue isn’t willing to make any exceptions.

When my sister found out about the no-dog policy, she was upset and assumed I would make a case to the venue for her and Max. The thing is, I’ve been waiting for this day my whole life, and I don’t want anything to go wrong. I’m worried that even though Max is a service dog, he could still cause some sort of issue or be a distraction. Also, I don’t want to start a fight with the venue that could risk our deposit or the entire booking.

So, I told her that while I would love to have her at the wedding, I can’t have Max there. I offered to arrange transportation and a pet sitter for Max nearby, so she could check on him whenever she wanted, but she said that wouldn’t work because she needs him with her at all times. She then said that if Max couldn’t come, she wouldn’t be able to attend, and now she’s not speaking to me.

My parents are furious and think I’m being heartless. They 
said I should be willing to do anything to have my sister there on my special day. Some of my friends agree, while others think my sister is being unreasonable for putting me in this position.

46,1erf90k,AITA for ignoring my parents over a lightbulb,"Two days ago, I (F16) had an argument over a smart bulb I recently bought. To give more context me and my sister (F18) share a room and she was meant to be moving out this September for university but she decided around a month ago that she won’t be going to university because the loan required for her to go is against her religion. However, I had already bought and ordered alot of room decor anticipating that I would have the room to myself.

One of these items was a smart bulb that I had been really excited to get due to the fact that I wasn’t able to get LED strip lights during covid due to us sharing a room. So I ended up setting it up anyways because I didn’t think it would be a big issue. 

For the smart bulb you have to keep the switch on so you can control it from your phone. (ie. the switch could be on and the bulb could be off.) The issue started when my sister would start switching off the switch even when the bulb was actually off. Usually during the day my sister doesn’t stay in the room however i noticed that she would come in and switch the light off even if the bulb was off. It got to the point where she started specifically coming in on a schedule to switch it off. I kindly asked her to stop doing this and explained how the bulb worked however she got angry and got my parents involved.She said the reason why she kept doing this was because she didn’t like the fact that I could control it from my phone and how I shouldn’t be allowed to control what colour the light is or when its on. This confused me because I always asked her if she wanted a certain colour and at the beginning when she asked me to switch the light off I always did (through my phone). 

My parents decided to just take out the bulb and refuse to give it back. I felt that this was unfair as they aren’t addressing the actual cause of the conflict and just choosing the most convient option.I didn’t purposely make an effort to ignore them but I just didn’t want to talk to them whilst I was still upset over the situation. But this morning my mother confronted me and said I was emotional blackmailing her and started crying and calling me abusive. I was pretty sure that I wasn’t in the wrong that much but after her response I’m no longer sure if what I did was ok.

47,1erf3si,AITA because my kid's ball went into my neighbor's yard? ,"We have a basketball hoop in our driveway and my son (7) loves to play ball.  He plays multiple times a week and, although it is never his intention, his ball will occasionally bounce off the backboard and go over the 4 foot high fence into the neighbor's yard.  The fence does not go all the way around, and our previous neighbor always said to feel free to just come grab the ball if it happened.  

Last year, a new neighbor moved in.  We introduced ourselves, but outside of that had little interaction with the new neighbor as she is rarely outside and hasn't seemed very interested in small talk when she is out.    Several months ago, my son's ball went over the fence and he walked over and grabbed it and went back to playing (neighbor wasn't home at the time).  We had never talked to her about going into her yard,  so I told him not to go over if it happened again and planned to talk to her about it next time she was out, but didn't see her out for weeks.  A month or so later, his ball went over again.  Neighbor (F-maybe 30) was out in the front yard working so I went over and said ""hi!  Our ball went into your back yard- I don't want to interrupt your work- would you mind if we grabbed it?"".  She responded very angrily- ""I don't want you or your kids in my yard, EVER."" She never looked up from what she was doing.  I was caught off guard and just mumbled sorry and walked away.   The next day she had a gate put up where the gap was previously.  The ball wasn't returned.  2 months later it happened again and we can still see the ball in her yard (4days later).  We've also seen her out in her yard so she has clearly seen it and is choosing not to return.  Seems like she'd rather trash the balls then give them back to a child. 

 We live in an area with many young children.  Nearly everyone is super friendly and kids are always running in and out of yards.  She is of course entitled to her privacy and we won't ever enter her yard again.  I understand balls going in a yard every couple months could be annoying- We try to keep balls in our own yard but in a suburb where houses are on top of each other a stray one occasionally happens.  Her yard is just grass-  it's not damaging anything.  Trying understand AITA here? ",Asshole,2024-08-13,"AITA because my kid's ball went into my neighbor's yard?

49,1erf0gh,AITA for wanting my best friend to pay me $200 back for a curling iron? ,"I (17F) got a high end curling iron as a present on Christmas of 2020 from my mom. It was $200 and I cherished it a lot. But I didn't use it often because I have natural pin straight hair. Only on special occasions for extra volume. Now my best friend (16F) once went out with her class for dinner, and since she has curly hair she wanted to straighten it that day. So I let her borrow mine. On that day I reminded her to look after it well and to not break it. One of her friends from class (16F) asked her how she managed to get her hair pin straight. So she told her that it was because of my curling iron. After that my best friends classmate also wanted to borrow it, and I was okay with it as long as she would bring it back in one piece. With time passing they borrowed it more often. I never said no because it looked fine to me and I trusted them. But one day I let my friends classmate take it again and I told her to give it back to me before the summer holidays start because I'll be out of the country. Instead of giving it back to me she decided to give it to my best friend, she then proceeded to fly out of the country with her family and take the curling iron with her instead of giving it back to me, without my consent. Now yesterday she texted me after I asked her if she had it and she said that it's broken. The cable won't work anymore and it has a loose connection. So I told her that I gave it to her classmates and not her. She then told me that it was okay for her to take it to vacation and use it without asking me because she had used it many times before. I told her that she had broken my trust in her and that I want a new one. Later on I found out that the exact same curling iron is discontinued and that she can't buy me a new one (she refused to buy one anyway) so I told her that she had to compensate me back since it was a gift and very expensive. I even tried to lower the price for her from $200 to $130 because she was my friend. She then refused again and argued with me about how it's already so old and the cable was gonna have a loose connection sooner or later and that it's not her fault. I messaged her friend after that she also refused to compensate me, even though I was ready for them to evenly split the bill and somehow give me my money back. From my best friends older sister I also found out that she treated the cable very badly and that she let other people use my curling iron without even telling me. Now I'm stuck arguing with her over this matter since yesterday. Both of them refuse to pay me back and even tell me that I should just buy a new one. Which I don't have any money for since my family is from low income. The curling iron was a very important present to me from a loved one and I can't forgive them just because they are my fiends.

51,1erez4x,AITA for refusing to switch rooms with my mom and her boyfriend?,"I (19NB) technically have the “master bedroom” and my mom (37F) has the only other bedroom. My brother(18M) lives in the loft. I am looking for a job right now, it’s been about 2 months but the job market is absolute shite where I live. Her boyfriend (38M) lives with us, he moved in a couple months back. My brother is also unemployed. He is not job searching.

We live in a 2bd2ba apartment with a loft. The “master” bedroom is practically the same size as the other bedroom, max 2 feet larger. It just has its own bathroom but it’s small. The bathroom takes up all the extra space the room technically has, a sink area and mirror and then a closed off shower and toilet area. I use my space appropriately, and have more furniture than she does (a bookshelf, vanity, record player on a small fold out camping table, night stand, bed ofc, and tv stand that doubles as a dresser). She just has her *massive king bed* and vanity and one nightstand. She complains that she has no space in her room. I tell her it’s because she has a king bed and needs to downsize from it, it’s just her and boyfriend (both skinny folks not fat at all) and they can use a queen, or a full like I do. A full might be a tight fit but they don’t need a king, and the room can’t fit it. She refuses, and wants my room. If she put her king bed in my room she would have *maybe* a foot and a half of extra space, not much to do with! I already have posters and flags and lights up, I don’t want to take them all down and organize it all again.

Also, her room has a walk in closet. She has an insane amount of clothing, she wears less than half of it. I don’t know why she has so much clothing. She wouldn’t be able to fit all her clothes in my tiny closet, and she says she would get a hanger thing outside of the closet but there would be *no room with her massive bed.*

Her main complaint besides the lack of space is my brother sharing the bathroom with her. He takes hours in there to shower every day and for like 10 minutes the water is on. I don’t know what he does in there. He also takes an hour in there to do whatever he does multiple times a day with the door locked. We have spoken about it, he refuses to adjust. This was MY nightmare for the years I shared a bathroom with him. I let them use my bathroom because of this. I only lock my bedroom door between 10:00pm and 7:00am while I am sleeping, but besides that my bathroom is free for them to use. 

She insists we need to switch, I am trying to say she just needs a smaller bed. And again, my bedroom space is practically the same size as hers, I just have a bathroom *that I allow her and her weird boyfriend to use whenever they need*  and it takes up all the extra space the room technically has, besides that they are *practically the same size.* AITA?

Edit: FAQ, I paid my rent portion last month and half of my rent portion this month. I also paid electric and water this month. I paid more into the household than her for a whole almost 2 years before unemployment as well so I feel I should get some leeway. Also, we would have more money if she didn’t go out every weekend and spend more money than she has on frivolous things. She did this before my unemployment and my paycheck covered it all, then I got fired for absolute bs which I won’t go into right now because it’s a long story.

53,1eretaw,AITA for pressing a kid for a potentially genuine gesture?,"Hi all,

I’m not sure how to feel about a recent encounter I just had with a 14-15 year old kid. In some ways, I’m happy but at the same time I’m annoyed at myself.

For context, I’m a 26 year old British Chinese male who grew up in the north of the country. My accent is as northern as it gets, and I grew up being the only Chinese kid in my school. Naturally, I got made fun of with the typical slurs which I won’t repeat. 

Growing up, I always felt self conscious whenever people were looking at me and laughing; i always assumed the worst and being the only Asian kid meant that I had no one to relate to.

Fast forward to 30 minutes ago in the south of England. I’m cycling to the gym and I ride past a bunch of kids - one kid shouts “Ni Hao” at me whilst I ride past and one of his friends say “wow that’s rude”.

I immediately stop and ask the kid “what you saying”. It seemed that he assumed I didn’t speak English. He replies saying I was just saying Ni Hao, sorry. I then begin to press the kid, and I ask to repeat that again for me but he doesn’t. I then get off my bike and ask what he meant by that to which he replies I was just saying hello. 

I then get back on my bike and he runs in the opposite direction. I’m not sure how to feel about this - am I wrong to assume the worst?

Maybe this kid was genuinely being nice and saying hello in my language but a part of me saw this as payback for all the kids that made those kind of jokes growing up. 

Am I in the wrong here, I feel guilty for pressing the kid in front of his friends and potentially embarrassing him but at the same time I assume the worst. ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-13,"AITA for pressing a kid for a potentially genuine gesture? Hi all,

54,1erepou,AITA for refusing my friends' help?,"I'm a teenage with depression and anxiety. I have classes everyday at the morning and the evening, but I skip school a lot due to fatigue, sickness (that are very commom for me, unfortunately). 

I didn't tell any of my friends I am depressed (I have told them only the fact that I have anxiety) and ofc had to endure a lot of times when they tried to give me a lecture about why I ""should take school seriously and stop being lazy"", I have said a million times to them I wouldn't skip if I was just lazy, and told them to stop talking about this because it was stressful to me. I just didn't wanted to specify it was depression. 

Until this day one of my friends that I am not that close just sent a message in our groupchat basically saying he heard from my close friends I was lazy and irresponsible and everything etc, and said he wouldn't stop bothering me till I was ""awaken to the real world"", this day everything went downhill, I had to say to this close friend I was depressed and explained all the fights I go through every single day. She was sympathetic that day.

Despite that, this same person didn't stop the lectures about laziness and the way I was ""letting my problems eat me"" and we argued a lot and she said things like: ""I don't have depression but I have anxiety, and look at me, I am not letting it control me"", ""I hate the way you treat us when we try to help you"", A way of help that just stresses me more. I got really fucking angry, went extreme and said that if I weren't fighting it, I would probably already be dead by that time. 

We ended up talking and we agreed on letting it go because that day was the bday of one of our friends and we didn't wanted to ruin it. And also she promised me not trying to ""help"" anymore and also said she would not bring that up anymore.

Today I went to school and all of them gathered and one of them just told straight that coexistence with me is tiring and they all agreed on ""stop caring"" about me because all the times they tried to help, I would just respond to it by being ""rude"", and the friend brought up the messages we shared (breaking our agreement).

I didn't tell any of my friends I am depressed (I have told them only the fact that I have anxiety) and ofc had to endure a lot of times when they tried to give me a lecture about why I ""should take school seriously and stop being lazy"", I have said a million times to them I wouldn't skip if I was just lazy, and told them to stop talking about this because it was stressful to me. I just didn't wanted to specify it was depression. 

Until this day one of my friends that I am not that close just sent a message in our groupchat basically saying he heard from my close friends I was lazy and irresponsible and everything etc, and said he wouldn't stop bothering me till I was ""awaken to the real world"", this day everything went downhill, I had to say to this close friend I was depressed and explained all the fights I go through every single day. She was sympathetic that day.

Despite that, this same person didn't stop the lectures about laziness and the way I was ""letting my problems eat me"" and we argued a lot and she said things like: ""I don't have depression but I have anxiety, and look at me, I am not letting it control me"", ""I hate the way you treat us when we try to help you"", A way of help that just stresses me more. I got really fucking angry, went extreme and said that if I weren't fighting it, I would probably already be dead by that time. 

We ended up talking and we agreed on letting it go because that day was the bday of one of our friends and we didn't wanted to ruin it. And also she promised me not trying to ""help"" anymore and also said she would not bring that up anymore.

Today I went to school and all of them gathered and one of them just told straight that coexistence with me is tiring and they all agreed on ""stop caring"" about me because all the times they tried to help, I would just respond to it by being ""rude"", and the friend brought up the messages we shared (breaking our agreement). 

I spent the rest of the school day feeling bad and kind of excluding myself from everyone thinking that maybe my communication might be bad, plus that my personality really is not the best. But I still feel like I was did wrong.

55,1erenk4,AITA for telling my SIL nobody asked me anything?,"I (21M) just got back from visiting my family for a couple of weeks, mostly my parents. Last Sunday we had a family dinner and during the dinner my SIL asked my brother if he had ""asked me yet"". That's the part I heard anyway and I was like ""Asked me what? Nobody asked me anything."" SIL looked taken aback and my brother started acting all sheepish. She told me it was okay and it was just something my brother was meant to ask.

Come to find out my brother and SIL wanted to use my deadname (I'm FTM transgender) for their daughter. Or at least SIL wants to. She wasn't sure I'd be okay with it so asked my brother to ask me if it would be a problem. But I guess he didn't want to use my deadname. So he planned to just let it drop. Or maybe he was going to lie and say I looked uncomfortable.

My brother was like what did you go and say that for. That I should have kept quiet. I told him I wasn't aware that my deadname was being discussed as a possible baby name and I didn't know he wasn't planning to be honest or do as she asked. He told me I shouldn't jump in when I don't hear the whole thing and now he's in the doghouse. I told him he could have given me a heads up then. He said he didn't want to give me the wrong idea. I told him I'm not offended he doesn't want to use it, might feel weird about them using the name but not offended about that either. But how was I supposed to know he was holding back.

He told me I should have listened better or waited to say something until I knew what was being discussed. I told him I wouldn't have found out unless I commented like I did. He didn't disagree. So he was going to keep burying this.

He was pretty pissed with me the rest of the time there. SIL apologized for the confusion. I said it was fine and not a big deal. But I know my brother is pissed at me for speaking before knowing what was going on.

They wanted to wait for another day or two. My SO grew impatient and told them the tickets will be sold out if we wait too long. This convo all happend in groupchat btw. My SO told J&J that they are procrastinators basicly. Our friends took this very badly. It escalated into an argument when my SO started with the parking permits and the almost non existent groceryshopping. 


He told me before he sent the text that he would be bringing this up. I on my hand told him not to. I told him it would not end well. That i would stay out of this argument. This isn't a conversation that should be held over texting. Everything becomes twisted.


Anyway, all hell broke loose. J&J cut our friendship because they couldn't even recall this agreement we made a year ago. They went on with beeing tired from work to having a busy schedule and so on.

Before we purchased I had dreamed of paying off my mortgage early and being completly debt free, this was fueling my work and productivity - a means to an end in the rat race.

Fast forward to now and me and my partner have no alignment on finances, he owes his parents around £20,000, buys alot of things on BNPL such as gadgets and phones, is about to get a new car on finance for £60K and thinks I'm living in a dream world if I can pay off the house early (currently 400k left). All of which terrifies me and has made me lose drive for work since I just cant see and end.

We have discussed getting married and even before we purchased a home together I told him I was not going to marry someone who has debt - which I thought would spur his drive to clear his debt but hasn’t.

There's lots of things that currently need doing in the house and my boyfriend has made comments that ill need to be the one to fork out the majority since I have more savings ( around 50k currently which I was planning to throw at the mortgage once our term ends) however I don't believe this is fair as I've sacrificed alot to save this!

Would I be the asshole if I told my BF he cannot get a new car?

Just for context: Outside of finance values, myself and boyfriend have an amazing relationship.

I moved out of the marital house, and let my soon to be ex wife keep the house so the kids wouldn’t have to be completely uprooted, and cause them any more stress in their lives than what they were already dealing with. When I first left, we handled everything between us, such as visitation with the kids, what days, and so forth. It worked well at the time, I would take the girls any chance I could, which would happen to fall on all the times she worked.  I literally left my house with the clothes on my back. Didn’t even have a pot or pan to cook with. I had to rebuild my life completely from the ground up.

Some of the plans just couldn’t be broken. I know as a parent, it shouldn’t matter if I had plans or not, but it got to the point where she would send them to my house because she had plans of her own on her scheduled days with them. 
It got to the point where I had to tell her we need to come up with a set schedule, to keep it consistent for all parties involved. Especially the kids. They never knew where they were going or when they would be going. 

Once I brought that up, it was like opening the flood gates. She didn’t want a set schedule because her work schedule is all over the place, and mine is more consistent, typical Monday - Friday. Since she was unwilling to work with me on a set schedule, I had to take matters into my own hands and filed for custody.

Jordan’s childhood bedroom is in our house and is used during his college breaks. He moved back on campus earlier this week, but his college is relatively close so he visits pretty regularly.

Recently, my parents (77 and 82) visited for the first time since I moved in. They were visiting from the south and we live up north, so this was meant to be a longer stay. My parents, who are elderly and require space and comfort, found the guest rooms uncomfortable and asked to use Jordan’s room, which is larger and has a more comfortable bed. BF was hesitant, but I agreed since I want my elderly parents to be comfortable. My parents found the room more suitable.

The next morning while I was out, my parents texted me saying they were uncomfortable with the room’s decorations, including photos, posters, and a fraternity flag which they found juvenile and garish. I told them they could remove the items, planning to store them in a guest room. When I returned, I discovered my parents had misunderstood and discarded the items, thinking Jordan had moved out permanently. They were thrown out and unfortunately couldn’t be retrieved. We didn’t think it was a big deal as they were nothing of particular value.

When my boyfriend came home, he saw what had happened and heard us joking about it, which upset him. Jordan coincidentally also came back to get some other belongings that night and was annoyed that my parents didn’t apologize. This led to my parents leaving to stay with another relative.

My sister (30F) knows my situation and the importance of my service dog in helping me function in social situations. My dog is trained and well-behaved.

Last weekend, my sister got married. When I RSVP’d, I indicated that I would be bringing my service dog with me. A few days before the wedding, she called me, visibly stressed, and said that while she understands my need for the dog, she felt it would be disruptive and might make some guests uncomfortable. She asked if I could attend the ceremony and reception without him.

I explained that I rely on my service dog, especially in stressful situations like weddings, but she insisted it would ruin her “perfect day” if guests were distracted or if photos were “ruined” by the dog being in them. She offered to have someone stay with me to help if I felt anxious, but I politely declined, reiterating that my service dog was essential for my well-being.

On the day of the wedding, I decided to attend the ceremony without my dog, but after a few hours at the reception, I started feeling overwhelmed and decided to leave early, explaining my situation to my sister. She was visibly upset and later sent me a long text, accusing me of making her wedding about myself and not compromising for her big day.

Now, my family is divided. Some understand why I had to leave, while others think I should have stayed and “toughed it out” for my sister’s sake. I’m feeling torn and unsure if I handled the situation correctly.

I explained that I rely on my service dog, especially in stressful situations like weddings, but she insisted it would ruin her “perfect day” if guests were distracted or if photos were “ruined” by the dog being in them. She offered to have someone stay with me to help if I felt anxious, but I politely declined, reiterating that my service dog was essential for my well-being.

On the day of the wedding, I decided to attend the ceremony without my dog, but after a few hours at the reception, I started feeling overwhelmed and decided to leave early, explaining my situation to my sister. She was visibly upset and later sent me a long text, accusing me of making her wedding about myself and not compromising for her big day.

Now, my family is divided. Some understand why I had to leave, while others think I should have stayed and “toughed it out” for my sister’s sake. I’m feeling torn and unsure if I handled the situation correctly.

AITA for leaving my sister’s wedding early because I wasn’t allowed to bring my service dog?

63,1ercvxf,AITA for forcing my wife to get rid of her pet dog? ,"TL;DR at end of post.

Edit: To clear things up, when we first met she lived with her mother and her mother also had three dogs. My wife made the decision on her own that she did not want to separate her dog from her mother's dogs. I also made it clear to her that I was okay with her bringing the dog back once we found a place that dogs were allowed so I'm not completely opposed to him being with us because I love her, despite my dislike for him. Under our current situation though it's simply not feasible.

So, my wife has a dog that she’s had for over six years. When we first met, she was living in North Carolina, and I was in Tennessee. When things got serious between us, she decided to move to Tennessee with me. The place we moved to doesn't allow dogs, so she left her dog behind with her mom. I’ve never really liked the dog because he’s super noisy—he whines and howls constantly.

Fast forward to about four months ago: the dog contracted parvo and, against the odds, survived. After getting out of the vet's office, he needed to take antiviral medication for 10 days, and he would only take it from my wife. She contacted our landlord to see if the dog could stay with us just for those 10 days while she medicated him, with the plan being that he would go back to her mom’s afterward. But here’s the thing—she never took him back. Now, she wants the dog to stay with us, even though it’s against our lease agreement.

The situation is stressing me out. Due to his constant howling and whining, she can’t leave the house without him, or he’ll howl the entire time. If we get a complaint, we could possibly be evicted. I’ve told her on several occasions that the dog needs to go back to her mom’s, but she keeps making excuses, like he has a vet appointment in a few days, and she’ll take him back after that. But he never actually goes back, and she avoids the conversation because she’s trying to keep him here.

I’m at the point where I feel like I need to force the issue. Either I take him back to her mom’s, or she does. She knows I don’t like the dog, she knows I didn’t want him here, and she knows we’re not supposed to have him in the house that I pay the rent for. We can’t really afford all the expenses that come with the dog either.

So, am I the asshole for putting my foot down and insisting she gets rid of him, even though she loves the dog dearly and wants him to stay?

TL;DR: My wife’s dog was supposed to stay with us for 10 days to take medication, but she never took him back to her mom’s. Now, she wants to keep him despite our lease prohibiting pets, and it’s causing stress.  Am I the asshole for insisting the dog has to go?

In the interview, I clarified that on a specific date, I could not come in for a Thursday and the following weekend as I had just started a degree and would need to go across the country to enrol in classes and attend my first-weekend class. It was all hunky dory in the interview, no issues. The head RVN wrote down the dates and assured me it wouldn't be an issue. I got the job and noticed a few things weren't fair or to my liking. I will admit that I was visibly unhappy and felt a few things were off with the care of the animals.

It struck me odd, but I carried on with my notice until the day I needed off. On my first day starting, I noticed that I was on the rota for the days I asked off.

For a lil background info, basically Amy and her friend for more years than me, Sam, are super close, given how long they've been friends. I've always had no problem going out with them, just the three of us, even though Sam and I aren't the closest. However, this all changed once Sam decided to randomly leave the school. Sam being a very secretive person, as well as Amy, told me nothing, which I respect, since we werent that close in the first place. But then during chinese new year, february, I invited Amy over to eat my mom's traditional cooking, and she invited Sam too. I was excited because i hadnt seen her in a long time, but it was certainly not the experience I was hoping... They were catching up, right in front of me, whispering about how her new school is, and when I asked anything, they would brush it off. Now, maybe this seems pretty immature of me, but bare with me. After all the whispering, I decided to try initiate more convos, and i guess it worked, and the night ended pretty good, but the fact that they were whispering and talking about something they clearly didn't want me to know, was honestly a bit brutal for me, because I would just be sitting there half the time, staring into space.

Now back to the present. There would be a fireworks show coming up in just a few days time, and I had invited my friends to come see. Amy takes this opportunity to invite..Sam as well. I was hesitant, but then agreed, as i thought that I should not judge too quick. From their social media updates, they had seemed to be going out quite often, and catching up once in a while, so I had assumed they wouldnt exclude everyone out and all, but boy was i wrong. When I had arrived, everyone else was sitting on the picnic mat, except amy and sam. They were giggling, staring at their phone, and forgot to even say hi to me, until i did of course. For even more context, Amy was usually the life of the party socialising and all, but not anymore it seemed.?

70,1erb5rh,AITA for keeping the lost wages money paid to my son after he totaled both of my cars?,"My 17-year-old son has been working hard all summer to buy a new car for his senior year. We had given him an old VW Beetle, during his junior year because he’s honestly a great kid. He stays out of trouble, sets and meets goals and has already earned himself a full scholarship for powerlifting to a great college. The beetle is on it’s last leg and he decided to work all summer doing concrete to buy himself a nicer vehicle instead of fixing the beetle. To help him, I offered to let him drive for the summer the Ford Focus I inherited when my mom died under the condition that he would keep oil in it. Despite reminders, he forgot, and the Focus broke down. Luckily I still had my wonderful “02 Tahoe that was still going strong with 270k miles on the odometer. I let him drive the Tahoe to finish out the summer and agreed to just walk my daughter to the babysitter and myself to work. 

2 weeks later, I wake up to find out from the Sheriff's department that my son was in a major accident. Thankfully, he was okay, but my Tahoe, which he had been using, was totaled. The accident occurred because he fell asleep driving to work after working 12 hours in the July heat then going to the gym the day before. He wasn’t speeding or using his phone, and his seatbelt saved his life. He had rolled my Tahoe going 55mph. 

While I’m relieved he’s safe, I’m left without a car, and expenses are piling up. The Tahoe was towed for $380, which insurance didn’t cover. We only had liability insurance, which has now increased. It covered personal injury and lost wages for him only. but my son wasn’t injured and was back at work and the gym three days later. My husband’s and I who pay the mortgage and all the bills received nothing for our lost wages after having to leave work to deal with accident and take him to the hospital. My son went on that weekend to buy an old truck from a coworker, using parts from the Tahoe to fix it up. This included the brand new battery and tires I had put in my tahoe. I insured and tagged his new truck.

My son went on a pre-planned vacation, and I sent him $100 from the $470 lost wages check he received. When he found out it was from the insurance, he got very upset with me, as if I was robbing him. 

Am I wrong for keeping the remaining $370 to put toward a new vehicle for myself? I love my son and am thankful he’s unharmed, but the Tahoe was my only reliable vehicle, and we were already struggling financially.

2 weeks later, I wake up to find out from the Sheriff's department that my son was in a major accident. Thankfully, he was okay, but my Tahoe, which he had been using, was totaled. The accident occurred because he fell asleep driving to work after working 12 hours in the July heat then going to the gym the day before. He wasn’t speeding or using his phone, and his seatbelt saved his life. He had rolled my Tahoe going 55mph. 

While I’m relieved he’s safe, I’m left without a car, and expenses are piling up. The Tahoe was towed for $380, which insurance didn’t cover. We only had liability insurance, which has now increased. It covered personal injury and lost wages for him only. but my son wasn’t injured and was back at work and the gym three days later. My husband’s and I who pay the mortgage and all the bills received nothing for our lost wages after having to leave work to deal with accident and take him to the hospital. My son went on that weekend to buy an old truck from a coworker, using parts from the Tahoe to fix it up. This included the brand new battery and tires I had put in my tahoe. I insured and tagged his new truck.

My son went on a pre-planned vacation, and I sent him $100 from the $470 lost wages check he received. When he found out it was from the insurance, he got very upset with me, as if I was robbing him. 

Am I wrong for keeping the remaining $370 to put toward a new vehicle for myself? I love my son and am thankful he’s unharmed, but the Tahoe was my only reliable vehicle, and we were already struggling financially.

I had enough today and I went out and said in a  calm tone of voice, ‘Sorry would you mind not pulling our lavender out?’

She then said, ‘Are you serious? It doesn’t harm the plant’

I replied ‘that’s all well and good, but well, it’s just disrespectful as it’s our property’

She then said, ‘Well I have some advice for you — if you had cut it back last year, it would have grown better, you haven’t done that and it hasn’t grown well at all’ and then made a cheeky smirk and walked on. 

I was sort of flummoxed at that reply and closed the door. I have social anxiety and don’t like confrontation. I wish I said more. 

Makes me so angry that she feels she has the right to do that. She may be right in that it doesn’t harm the plant, but it’s just the principle of it. And I can’t get over her rude reply about how we aren’t growing it correctly. Can hardly focus on my work, I’m just pacing about with irritation 😂

73,1erafc3,AITA for agreeing/siding with my parents when they told my sister naming her son after her late husband isn't a good idea?,"My sister Amanda (37f) was married for 10 years to Noah. They were high school sweethearts and she was very close to his family at first but during the marriage she and Noah's family drifted apart. When Noah died Amanda was hoping they would become closer but they did not. Three years on and my sister got pregnant after a very brief sexual relationship. The guy does not want to know her or their son. My sister has said she's glad because Noah was the only guy for her and no matter who she sleeps with or dates, she doesn't ever want these people. It's just escape.

My sister has this weird idea that she could raise her son almost like he was Noah's son. She was hoping Noah's parents would remember that they used to love her and would be grandparents and other extended family to her son. They, of course, were not interested and so now my sister has decided to name her son Noah in order to win them over. She believes they can't reject a mini-me of Noah even though her son is not Noah's child and no matter how much she wishes he could be, he can't. He died.

My parents spoke up when she announced the name news. They told her it is not a good idea. It's the worst idea. Not only will this not suddenly make Noah's parents want her son but it's not fair to her son to live in Noah's shadow, in the shadow of a man who isn't his father or a part of his family. She said Noah is everything to her and will be to her son as well.

She told me what happened over the phone. Told me she couldn't believe our parents. I told her they were concerned and gently suggested she give it some thought because maybe her son would like a name less connected to her sadness and grief. I also suggested it would be healthier for her to accept they will not be a part of Noah's extended family and that she should just focus on her little boy.

My sister told me she can't believe I would side with our parents, that we're wrong, and we should support her and have her back. She told me she really needs us and so does her son. And we can't turn on her or alienate her over this. She also mentioned being so disappointed in me.

74,1era236,AITAH for telling my sister in law that she’s an asshole for being insensitive?,"Hi, 

I’m an Indian expat who lives in the US. I have to use WhatsApp to be in touch with my family, and as a result I’ve been added to a group chat that includes me and my wife (she’s American), my parents, and my brother and his wife (she’s Indian).

My sister in law (who I’ll call Tina) and I don’t get along. I honestly find a lot of her views on Indian politics to be abhorrent (I won’t go into specifics because it’s not relevant to the story), and she has a callous disregard for people she dislikes.

As you may be aware, the monsoons in India have become extremely unpredictable of late, and it’s caused severe flooding in major Indian cities. 

My brother and her live in one such city, and so do my maternal uncle and his family. 

As a brief diversion, this maternal uncle’s family have been very generous to my brother and I when we were growing up. My brother and I pretty much grew up in his apartment, and his children, our maternal cousins, Sita and Gita, were like our sisters.

Tina and my cousins don’t get along, and they happen to live in the same city. The drama between Tina and especially Gita has gotten so bad that there’s been a lot of bad blood, and it’s led to an estrangement between my mother and my uncle. 

Anyhow, when the monsoon flooding hit the city my relatives lived in, my father shared a news article detailing the damages to a neighborhood Sit and Gita reside. 

As opposed to making inquiries about my uncle’s family’s well being, Tina made a derisive remark about how she’s glad she doesn’t live in the flood impacted part of the city anymore. My brother and Tina used to live in an apartment Sita rented out to them when they were newly married and at a below market rate. And they moved out because of her incorrigible behavior rubbing my uncle’s family off the wrong way one too many times.

Thanks to the time zone difference between here and the US, I only saw these messages when I woke up and was deeply annoyed. I asked my mother on the group chat if my uncles family was alright. Luckily, my mother confirmed that Sita and Gita were not in danger.

Having confirmed they were safe, I called Tina out on her callousness. 

Tina instead of apologizing, doubled down, wrote a half assed non apology, and then proceeded to tell me that flooding is a normal part of life in India. She also said that everyone’s family gets affected and that the entire state the city is in has been impacted by floods. 

This pissed me off to no end. In spite of me telling her why I felt she lacked empathy, and why I care about my uncle’s family, she said that it was unfair of me to accuse her of lacking empathy.

I got so annoyed that I told her I’d rather not engage with her in a group setting and left the group chat. 

I also decided to block her from my socials because her espousal of her political views on social media had left me annoyed to no end lately. 

My wife thinks I overreacted and she says I have placed her in an awkward spot because she’s still in the group chat and that she doesn’t know how to engage with my family in my absence. 

One of the reasons I left India was to avoid toxicity arising from people like my sister in law. I don’t deny that I was wrong to have to put my wife in this spot, and I have apologized to her.

That being said, I’d like to know if I was an asshole for having called Tina out on her bullshit.

75,1er9yp0,WIBTA for contacting my biological family even though my adoptive brother doesn’t want me to?,"I (22M) was adopted when I was about two years old. My adoptive parents also adopted another boy, Sam (18M), who isn’t biologically related to me. Neither of us has had any contact with our biological families, as our parents made it clear they wanted us to wait until we were at least 18 before exploring that part of our past. I’ve always respected their wishes, and when Sam turned 18, we decided to take an at-home DNA test together.

Before we did the test, we made a pact. If either of us found any biological family members, we’d support each other, no matter what. The idea was that we were in this together, and if only one of us found family, the other would still be there, no matter how it turned out. The whole reason I waited until now was because I wanted us to do this together, as we’d always planned.

Fast forward to when we got our results. I was lucky enough to find some close biological family matches, and one of them turned out to be a brother I never knew I had. He sent me a message right away, and it was full of excitement. He talked about how he’s been searching for me for years and how much he wants to connect. It was overwhelming in the best way possible, but I haven’t replied yet because I wanted to process everything first.

Sam, on the other hand, wasn’t as fortunate—his closest match was a fifth cousin, someone who is basically a stranger. Understandably, he was pretty upset. I tried to be there for him, but things took a turn when I told him about the message from my brother. Sam got really upset and said it wasn’t fair for me to contact my biological family while he’s stuck with nothing. He thinks it’s selfish of me to even consider it when we should be doing this together, and if he can’t find his family, then neither should I.

This led to a pretty heated argument. I tried to explain that I’ve waited years to do this, out of respect for our parents and because I wanted to share the experience with him. But now that the opportunity is here, I feel like I shouldn’t have to wait any longer, especially since this might be my only chance to connect with my roots. I don’t want to hurt Sam, but I also don’t want to miss out on this connection with my biological brother, who seems so eager to get to know me.

I understand where Sam is coming from. It feels like I’d be abandoning him if I move forward without him, and I don’t want to make his feelings worse than they already are. But on the other hand, we’re adults now, and I think it’s okay for me to pursue this. It’s not like I’m trying to exclude him or downplay his feelings, but I don’t want to let this opportunity pass by.

77,1er9rxl,AITA for not responding to my moms text? ,"I (25F) have a tough relationship with my mom. When I express my feelings, like saying, ""I don’t like how you’re speaking to me; it’s making me anxious,"" she tends to manipulate the situation until I apologize. She often freezes people out until they apologize, regardless of how the argument started. She also claims to be a 'therapist' due to her degree and past work in therapy, but she hasn’t been active in the field for over 20 years. She uses this background as a power tool in our relationship.

Here’s my current issue: My mom recently told me and my sister that we will be taking care of her dog (let’s call him Pup) for two weeks while they’re on vacation. This was a surprise, especially since we've previously said we’re not comfortable doing it again.

Why we’re uncomfortable and what we have communicated:

1. Pup is used to having two stay-at-home parents. My sister and I both work full-time jobs. During his last visit, we had to commute back to our apartment to feed and walk him. This time, Mom said we could leave him alone, which would mean 8+ hours alone for 2 weeks, something Pup isn’t used to and might find stressful.

2. We don’t have a pet-friendly apartment. We’d be devastated if something happened to it because we couldn’t care for Pup properly.

3. Pup is also not used to city life and can be slow and anxious on walks, which makes me uneasy as a young woman walking alone at night.

Mostly upset that we weren’t asked; we were just told. After arguing with our parents over the weekend about this, Mom sent this text: “Very upset girls regarding your thinking/perception in regards to taking care of Pup. Who is young and in very good health. Even if it was for 2 WEEKS OUT OF A YEAR neither of you would willingly take care of him. All caps are for emphasis on the amount of time a yr you are needed to give your time and love to him.”

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for not wanting to take care of Pup for 2 weeks and not responding to that text?

3. Pup is also not used to city life and can be slow and anxious on walks, which makes me uneasy as a young woman walking alone at night.

Mostly upset that we weren’t asked; we were just told. After arguing with our parents over the weekend about this, Mom sent this text: “Very upset girls regarding your thinking/perception in regards to taking care of Pup. Who is young and in very good health. Even if it was for 2 WEEKS OUT OF A YEAR neither of you would willingly take care of him. All caps are for emphasis on the amount of time a yr you are needed to give your time and love to him.”

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for not wanting to take care of Pup for 2 weeks and not responding to that text?

78,1er9pk0,AITA for calling my bsf out on social media? ,"I ended up calling my best friend out on social media. I basically said she did something horrible to me and people asked what she did.

I ended up saying that she pushed my boundaries and said rude shit to me. But people were telling me to delete it, so I did. My best friend is also really upset at me and said I made it out to look like she did something horrible.

What I was talking about was this: My best friend will ask me to hangout. If I'm busy, she'll tell me to do it another time and I'm soft so I'll eventually just go with what she says.

I have a problem saying no to her. So she'll ask me if I want a drink and I'll say no but she basically tells me to do it anyway and I do. But I'm not legal to drink, I'm only 20, so it feels bad. Like I'm a bad person.

I have type one diabetes. We were watching a video of a bunch of diabetic type one people (like me) who went on a run and treated themselves with desserts after. She said, ""ugh, shouldn't they be avoiding treats? Isn't that how they ended up like this?""

She knows type one is genetic because I have it. I can have sweets if I take insulin for it. It just really made me upset she said that.

So I couldn't take it anymore and called her out on social media. But she is really mad at me and said I'm a backstabber. AITA?

79,1er942r,AITA for drama in friend group with my ex?,"I have an ex whose friends I became quite close to while dating for the better part of a year and consider him and his friends to be more or less my main larger friend group where I live. I also stayed friends with my ex and the situation was all very friendly and fine for a couple years. For context, we are gay males. 

My ex (male) is from a conservative southern European country, but we live in a liberal Western European country.  He has always been conscious of who does and does not know of his sexual orientation, as he is not gay presenting outwardly.  He has some friends not part of our main friend group who live here or visit him that do not know.  

This was never a problem until recently when a couple of friends visited, and he intentionally discluded me from the entire weekend of activities because he felt if I was present they would be able to tell we had a previous romantic connection and didn’t want to risk them finding out.  

When I found out I was discluded from this (which included all of our mutual friends except for me), I expressed that my feelings were very hurt and that it felt disrespectful to me, despite it being his prerogative to invite who he wanted.  This resulted in a very hurtful argument between us, which actually spilled over into a group chat including our friends via text.  

 In this chat he denied some of the things he had said to me, including mainly threatening to cut me off from our friends as they were originally “his”.  Because he denied this, I shared screenshots in the chat showing what he had said to prove how I was being treated.  

Since this, he has basically said he no longer wants me in his life, which has now made group gatherings difficult. While I’ve still seen some of these friends one on one, naturally I’ve been discluded now from a couple of group hangouts because of this.  A mutual friend has explained to me that he wants an apology for sharing the screenshots and that I also accept his exclusion of me in these types of scenarios when people who do not know he is gay are present.  

I really value the friendships I have with some of these mutual friends, and up until recently, with him as well, however, he is unwilling to apologize to me for ostracizing me and for the threats he made. I’m willing to apologize, but I’d like him to also apologize and understand where I’m coming from as well. I realize I am not without fault, but I feel in this case we both owe apologies.  Unfortunately, without one from him, I feel I’m letting his bad behavior continue and I will be treated this way again.  However, if I don’t reconcile this, I worry I inevitably will lose this friend group entirely.

80,1er8vhl,AITAH for booking a flight on my friend’s birthday,"There are 5 of us all adults (20+) going on a trip to South Korea and Japan. We are part of a large group of 10 all adults (20+). 

For the ease of story telling each friend with have a number from 1-7

Friend 1,2 & 3 announced in our group chat that there was a sale going on for South Korea flights with an airline company and wanted to know if anyone was down to join. Friend 4 & 5 expressed interest quickly and so we booked the flights. 2 others, friends 6 & 7, were still unsure and had to work out uni / work arrangements before deciding. 

We have been high school friends for a while and have always wanted to do a group trip so we wanted the more the merrier!

A couple of weeks later, we wanted to fit in a Japan trip and so friends 1-5 were hunting for cheap flights. The cheapest flights booked ended up leaving to Japan on friend 6’s birthday. 

During earlier discussions between friend 1 & 6, friend 6 expressed that she would like to spend her birthday in South Korea as she had limited leave and would rather not join the Japan trip. 

When booking the Japan flights friends 1-5 were mainly looking for cheap flights and thought afterwards that if friend 6 wanted to join it would be okay to spend her birthday a day before the actual day or any other day during the trip.

Fast forward to a month later we announced to the group during friend 3’s birthday that we had also booked Japan. At this point friend 6 & 7 were still undecided as to whether they would like to join us.

Friend 6 was instantly disheartened and expressed frustration over the dates booked for Japan. As the night continued she ignored friends 1-4 (friend 5 was not present) but especially ignored friend 1.

Fast forward to present day — friend 1 has reached out and apologised to friend 6 3x times, without much progress in restoring the friendship. Friend 6 has not expressed as much hatred towards friends 2-5 compared to friend 1.

Friend 3 (me) thinks that friend 1 did not need to apologise as friend 6 was clearly still unsure of joining the travel plans even a month after it had been booked. It also confused me that she was not treating friends 1-5 equally in terms of the decisions made for travel dates. AITAH? Or has this situation gone for too long and friend 6 should just put it behind her?

Yesterday when pulling up to work, a moving truck was there. I saw the people loading it and I said you can’t park here. This woman asked if I could give them just 45 mins and I said no. A younger woman walked up and angrily said where are we supposed to park and I said I don’t know. The young girl said “f*** this we aren’t  moving” and continued to load the truck. The older lady begged me to give them 45 mins and said that was her daughter and things have been rough for her so far that morning. I told the lady, fine 45 mins and went back to work. 

An hour later, they’re still moving. I came out to the lady and said 45 mins is up and this truck needs to be moved. She said she doesn’t have the keys and will have to wait on one of the movers. I told her if the truck isn’t moved in the next 2 mins, I will call a tow truck. She said ok. 

10 mins later, the truck is still there. I told the woman to move the truck now or I’m calling the police. She said “call them”.

And when i got done fixing it my arms were covered in grease and i playfully held up my black hands and wiggled my fingers and was like ""i got man hands"" in a silly voice and he was like ""no you look like a lesbian"" in a kinda aggressive and mocking tone. 



Ive fixed his car or diagnosed his car problems 4 times now. Ive built furniture in our house twice. Ive done heavy yardwork and used a chainsaw to cut down tree branches that fell during a storm.

Not only do i not want to deal with his mockery and attitude fixing it myself i also just don't want to have to crawl around on the ground of the basement. My top guess for whats wrong is the heating breaker flipped. Its such an easy fix, he just needs to pull the dryer out and find the button for the breaker and press it. Then clean the lint trap for good measure. Thats it! But he's putting it off and looking at new dryers and shit. Like, we're going on a mini vacation to nyc in literally 2 days.

His parents are still alive, he has five siblings, they have something like 16 kids between them and then spouses. And all of them are coming to stay at our house for two weeks starting Saturday. I found this out Sunday night. Harry said some of his relatives are bringing tents and others are bringing camp beds so they can all fit. But they'll be here for two whole weeks and a bunch of them are also going to be sleeping inside.

Harry is so excited and my mom is all hyped up for it too. She isn't close to her family so she's looking forward to having family around. I personally can't wait for them to be gone. I hardly know any of them and even though they are technically family by marriage now, I don't know that I'll ever consider them my family.

My mom pulled me aside yesterday and told me I'm not acting excited and she can't understand why because she'd thought I'd want to get to know my extended family. I told her that's a lot of people I don't know or care about coming to stay and it's not going to be comfortable. I said a day would be a lot but two whole weeks sounds like hell to be stuck with Harry's huge ass family.

My mom started whisper scolding me saying they're our family too and how she expected me to be more eager to have them here. I told her I'd prefer to stay with a friend for the two weeks. I said they'd even have an extra room to use for everyone. My mom said that was such a negative attitude to have. She told me I'll finally have grandparents, aunts and uncles, some cousins even. Don't I want that. I told her I would much rather be comfortable in my friends home.

Then last night mom told me the way I talked about our family wasn't okay and that if I really want to go to my friends house and if his parents are cool with it, I could, but she will be disappointed and she will still expect me to change my attitude. I was like thank you but mom told me the way I described being around Harry's family as hell is not okay.

86,1er6r3x,AITAH for reacting to fiancé's comments? ,"So i 28 f have been with my 32m fiancé nearly 3 years now, engaged nearly a month ago (my second serious relationship) my past relationship was 10 years on and off due to being young. 

My fiancé knows litrally everything about me and in a way knows me better than I know myself. 

My past serious relationship with Dan like I said was on and off and I truly did love him I spent the best of 10 years with him  he was my first love. But it was toxic. He knew how inlove I was with him and he would leave me to get with this other girl (who knew was jealous of me and we didn't get along) to then come back crying saying he made a mistake and silly me took him back. Well one of the things he used to do was to call me fat. 

At the time I used to believe it and take it to heart, so it got to the point where I wouldn't eat or make myself sick. Looking back now, I realise how daft I was to even do that. And it got to the point that in my early 20s, I didn't weigh more than 7 stone. I was ridiculously thin. More to the point that the doctors were getting involved.

Iv never been big as I'd done gymnastics all my life since the age of 3, so I have/ was always small. 

Anyway to the point I realised how toxic that relationship was and completely cut ties. Now to today. Like I said iv been with my fiancé nearly 3 years and I have 2 baby girls 18 months and 5 months, very close in age but during pregnancy I put weight on and due to having to have 2 emergency c-sections the weight hasn't been as easy to loose (mum pouch) and I look at myself now and I feel physically sick. I cry and break down as I look at myself, and it's not me. I am so grateful to have my girls, and if I knew this was how my body was going to be, I'd still have them within a heartbeat. But the problem is my now fiancé calls me fat ( He says in a joking way), but it really hurts me as he knows everything Dan used to call me. 

I dont know what to do, iv stopped eating again and when I do I make myself sick and yes I do now feel fat but I have had two babies in the space of a year and 17 days. But the mental torture of not recognising myself in the mirror anymore is really starting to get me down.

87,1er6dhb,AITA if I warn my cousin about my family’s “demands” for her wedding?,"So just some back story to start off my cousin (31F) is getting married next June and we’re all really excited for her. I (30f) am privileged to be one of her bridesmaids. 

She’s doing everything DIY so we’re (bridesmaids and her parents) are helping as much as we can to make sure she gets the wedding she’s always dreamed of. With around 10 months to go myself, my plus 1 and my family are looking at our budgets for staying ready for the event. My mum (55) is making a lot of demands for her and my younger siblings (25m, 18f and 16m) she wants to make sure they have at least 4 rooms together at the accomodation which is a barn that fits 30 people and then a cottage that fits 4 and is asking me to push my cousin into making sure they get priority. 

We are coming from further away, my family are around 150 miles away, myself and my partner are around 250 miles away in the opposite direction. However we are not the only ones coming from that kind of distance as her father side also has to travel. My mums words to me were “we better get 4 rooms together and not end up with the leftovers and forgotten about. It’s alright for you your staying at the venue.” I am staying at the venue the night before so I can get ready with the rest of the bridal party the morning of but I will also be in accommodation after the wedding. My mother has also asked me to make sure my sister has a plus 1 for her best friend who is also joining them for a mini holiday after the wedding. She hasn’t asked the bride directly for a plus 1 just expects it. My worry with this request is that when I got married said plus 1 and another friend came to my wedding and they were drinking alcohol out of the boot of a car at my hotel venue which I didn’t know about until afterwards. (There was a bar but they were underage and got absolutely smashed).

I know that my cousin is keeping numbers small to keep costs down so I don’t know whether I should warn her that my family expects these things when she has enough to worry about with planning the wedding in itself. My priority is my cousin and making her happy for her day. 

For extra context my family and I are not that close they only ever talk to me when they want something and we’re similar to this for my wedding and when I said no things got heated but that’s a story for another day. My partner and I don’t mind where we stay as long as it’s somewhere it’s just my mum expecting the best because she’s “aunt to the bride”.

 If anyone asks why my sister is also not a bridesmaid I’m not entirely sure but the other bridesmaids are my cousins best friend and her own daughter, we’ve been close since we were children and she was a bridesmaid for me. I am now divorced for different reasons and my mother was like this then. I also asked the bride for my new partner to be my plus1 before save the dates went out.

88,1er69pq,AITA (22F) a bad person for not going to my partners (22M) birthday meal? ,"****Partners brothers birthday meal*** forgot to add that in the title

Hi all, for context my partners family is very family orientated, with a big emphasis on events/occasions/birthdays, mine is not so much and it’s never been an issue it can just be overwhelming sometimes. We have been together 7 years, and I have gone to basically everything, showed my face, been polite and had a good time. 

The issue started a couple months ago on my partners birthday. His parents wanted to go out clubbing/to more bars, I did not as I was not only tired but socially drained (my grandparent had just died as well as my dog that week so I was not in a very social mood). I did say to all of them they could continue the night and I would go home as I just was ready for home, however they didn’t and started calling me selfish and that I had ruined his birthday. For context I have had a few issues with them in the past (such as calling me ungrateful because I only verbally thanked him and didn’t buy his dad a gift for advising me with legal things, even though I was a victim of a crime at this time so getting a gift hamper wasn’t on the forefront of my mind.), Anyway! but other than that I thought they liked me. This was not my intention, and I was not miserable at the meal to say the situation I was in as I didn’t want to put a damper on his birthday. I got upset about them saying these things  and my partner did apologised the day after (blaming the booze). The thing is I haven’t seen his parents since. 


Then comes the issue, today I have been an invited to his brothers birthday meal. However it is mid week and over an hour away, so I declined as I am up at 6 for work the next day. I am not gonna lie, maybe I am abit of an AH for not wanting to go based on my previous experience however it is just also so inconvenient. Not to also mention I am not very close to his brother and have had issues with him in the past (like kicking me out of the house when I was 16 because he didn’t feel comfortable with me there… long story). So yeah, maybe I’m not very enthusiastic about the idea and don’t want to go.

Now my partner is calling me selfish, saying how I’m a joke and need to get a grip. He’s also saying that im trying to take him away from his family. This is not the case and I never said he couldn’t go, just that I was busy with work so would be unable to attend. I said to him to not speak to me like that as I haven’t done anything wrong and have every right to decline an invitation. I know I’m not perfect and probably do need to work on the stuff with his family, but AITA?

I started ignoring her calls and blocked her crazy aunt, who keeps insulting. It's not about the money it's the principle that she promised to repay me, but complains when I ask about MY money.

91,1er5v6v,AITA for arguing with my parents about our next vacation?,"I have struggled with social anxiety ever since middle school and have been the subject of ridicule and judgement from my peers ever since, as a consequence, I never had that many friends (aside from online ones) but this has changed during this last year. I began university in early october and after a few months I became best friends with two people: Martina and Lorenzo (not their real names).

We are very close to each other and some people have said that we might be too clingy but we don't care because we are happy. Among those people who always remarks about our friendship are my parents who probably didn't hope I'd befriend people like Martina and Lorenzo, instead hoping that I would surround myself with a circle of ""intellectual"" wannabes and pretentious snobs.

My parents have always been caring parents- perhaps too much to the point that it is smothering. They are very paranoid and don't seem to trust me very much because they see me as too ""naive"" and unable to see danger. Since I didn't have many friends, I missed out a lot of experiences which my peers were already having and I always went on vacation with my parents and even spent festive days with them.

But finally last year I was able to go visit some online friends for two days and ever since then I have had a little bit of more freedom. Finally this summer I was able to invite my two best friends to stay with us while we were vacationing on the Amalfi Coast. I spent three amazing days with them but after they left I just lost all motivation to go out with my parents because I realized that I am bored of being with them.

We came back yesterday and this morning, as I was still sleeping, my parents booked flights and hotel rooms for 3 days in Zurich without even checking in with me or my brother. I am furious because they are denying me the possibility to spend the 15th of August (an important festive day) with my best friends. And what's worse is that this whole vacation is taking place because of my mother. She hates the city we live in and constantly wants to be out of it. If we are in it for too long she complains and whines to the point that it is unbearable and my father only suggested this vacation because he doesn't want to  hear her complain.

I was honest with my parents about me not being excited to go because I am bored of always being forced to stay with them and - although I have not told my mother - my father knows that I hate the fact that we are going on this vacation just so that my mother shuts up. We argued for about an hour straight and at this point I am tired because they won't let me have a single inch of independence.

I know that being able to travel to the Amalfi Coast and Zurich is not something that most people can afford and I am grateful for it but I am tired of having to go on a second vacation just three days apart from the first and to have to spend my days with my butt glued to my parents.",Asshole,2024-08-13,"AITA for arguing with my parents about our next vacation?

92,1er5g3w,AITA for not going to my best friends hen party. ,"
My best friend got engaged last year, and asked me to be a bridesmaid. 

I was totally honest with her and told her we were going to start trying for our second baby and there would be a chance I could potentially be pregnant at her wedding, she was absolutely fine about this.

I have since become pregnant and I’m now 27 weeks. 

Her wedding is January 2025 which will he after the birth of my baby. 

She’s arranged a hen party which she wanted to have in the summer months this year. 
The plan is 35 people will be sharing a huge party house / cottage. 
There’s cocktail making arranged, meals out, and a party bus. 

It’s heavily based around alcohol, which I cannot participate in. 

I’m also trying to be pretty careful at the minute since i’m coming up to my third trimester and am aware that covid is doing the rounds again (I’m in the UK) and I don’t want to put myself at risk of catching it whilst pregnant. 

I’m already working from home and trying to mitigate my chances of exposure, and I just don’t think a boozy weekend (when I can’t drink) is worth the risk of catching something that could make me very unwell. 

She is having a second hen party in December which is just an afternoon tea followed by a pottery class (think this one is aimed more at her family who aren’t coming to the main event) 

I’ve told her I will definitely be at that one, but she’s completely taken then huff with me for not going to her main hen.

She thinks my “excuses” are not valid and i’m acting over the top.

93,1er5azz,AITA for confronting my friend for cancelling plans to study,"My friend and I are juniors in high school, and she is very studious and extremely academically driven. I usually am really happy for her, but I've noticed that recently she never **hangs out with us to study**, and the rare times she does hang out with us she is studying every spare second she can. She also has made it a habit of always cancelling plans to study. Neither me or my friends have confronted her about it, as we know she was really stressed during that period of time.

Fast forward to now, my school is putting on a music mentorship programme that was really special and a great opportunity, and she and I were going to go together. This was really exclusive, and if she didn't go, I would have been the only person in my category, which meant I would have had to do all the activities alone. I know that it's not a big deal, but of course I would have preferred if she was able to do it.

I knew there was a chance she would cancel, and so I specifically asked her last week to confirm whether she could go so I could book the tickets for the two of us, and she said she could. I was really excited because we never hang out anymore.

The programme was today, and she texted me at 9pm yesterday saying she had forgot about it and that she couldn't do it anymore because she had fallen behind and needed to study. I sort of confronted her, as I told her that she had made a commitment to me, and even though I knew studying was important to her, I thought she would have the decency to follow through with plans.

She was quite upset at it, and told me that I wasn't supporting her academically and did not want her to succeed in the future. I feel really bad about it now, because I had always thought confrontation was not necessary, but I was really disappointed in her in that moment.

94,1er51n7,AITA for refusing to hang out less with my brothers because of my stepsister?,"I (18F) am the youngest of four siblings. I have three older brothers Michael (28M), John (27M), and Chris (25M). Our mother passed away when I was 8, and since then, my father (53M) and my brothers have been quite protective of me. I had father-daughter date nights with my dad and movie nights with my brothers, among other things. I think that was their way of making sure I didn’t feel lonely.

Last year, my father got married to Melissa (45F). She, with her daughter Ashley (18F) moved in with us. I always got the sense that Ashley didn’t like me. She would talk to my dad and my brothers but she never talked to me. Whenever I tried to talk to her, she would answer curtly and then walk away. I never understood why, or if I did something to her, but after a few weeks of trying to get along with her without success, I gave up. We were civil to each other and that was enough. My brothers were also on the fence about her. She keeps insisting to be invited to our movie nights, but she would always demand to see a movie she liked even if none of us liked it, and she kept trying to cuddle with my brothers which they find uncomfortable and weird because they don’t really know her. Chris actually told her to knock it off because he didn’t like that she was so touchy with him.

Recently I had my 18th birthday, It was fun and low-key and I got wonderful gifts.

The next day Ashley came to me and told me that it was unfair that my brothers’ gifts to me were better than their gifts to her for her birthday last June. For context my brothers EACH gave her a 200$ give card to different stores so she can buy what she liked, because they didn’t really know her. They gave her gifts to be civil. My brothers got me a personalized perfume, a signed copy of an entire book series that I’ve been obsessed about lately, and a personalized planner with messages and quotes on each page. I will admit that they put more thoughts into my gifts but I think it’s fair since they don’t really know her.

But then Ashley started crying saying that I always got everything and she got nothing and she then demanded I stop hanging out with them and said that if I didn’t hang out with my brothers so much, then they would pay more attention to her. She also wanted me to tell them to treat her like they treated me because she was also their sister now. I told her that I won’t force my brothers to do something they didn’t like. She insisted that I call my brothers right that moment, to tell them that I would hang out less with them and that they should get Ashley better gifts. I refused.

96,1er4pet,AITA for kicking my bro out of the band he started,"Exactly what the title says. One of my best friends, let’s call him Patrick, got kicked out of the band he started. Here’s the story:

Back in year 9, Paddy had the idea to start a band. We were just bros messing around with instruments, but he got us together and convinced us we could actually do something. We played in garages, at school events, and started getting small gigs around town. It was a lot of fun and some of the best times of our lives.

As we grew older, the band got more serious. We had better gigs, gained more recognition, and started talking about recording an album. That’s when things went south with Paddy. He was the “founder” of the band, but he stopped pulling his weight. He’d show up late or not at all for practice, barely contributed to songwriting, and when he did, it was half-hearted.

The worst part was how he treated the rest of us. He had issues with everyone in the band—snapping at the drummer, criticizing the bassist unfairly, and even going after me for bringing new ideas. We tried talking to him, offering support, but nothing changed. The tension was unbearable and started affecting our performances. It was clear to everyone, including our fans, that he was dragging us down.

I made the tough decision to tell him to leave. It wasn’t easy because he’s a friend, but the band had to come first. I sat him down, explained it wasn’t working out, and told him he needed to step away. He didn’t take it well. There was a lot of yelling and accusations, but I stood my ground. The rest of the band agreed it was for the best.

After he left, things improved. We got our groove back, wrote great tracks, and even landed a deal to record our first EP. He didn’t stay in touch much, but when he did, it was mostly to guilt-trip us or remind us he started the band. We tried to keep it civil, but he was clearly resentful.

**Oh, and here’s the kicker:** He now wants a share of the royalties. He’s been out of the band for a while, hasn’t contributed to the new songs, but thinks he’s entitled to a cut because “he started the band.” I’m not sure how to handle this. I get that he’s hurt, but he’s not involved anymore.

So, AITA for kicking him out? I feel like it was the only choice I could make.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-13,"AITA for kicking my bro out of the band he started Exactly what the title says. One of my best friends, let’s call him Patrick, got kicked out of the band he started. Here’s the story:

98,1er49uk,AITA? Unintentionally or just an AH? ,"So I'm (29m) worried I'm coming across an AH to my Fiance (25f) of 6 years. 
Ive loved motorbikes since a really young age but I've been riding motorbikes for 4 years /since my 25th Birthday. I started with a mid-size 650cc sportsbike then moved to a 900cc naked after 3 years. Ever since I started riding I said for my 30th my plan was to get a ""big-boy"" bike or one of my dream bikes. 
I turn 30 next year, also the year we get married and go on our honeymoon. 

My partner is currently as I write this is going through her access course for full motorbike licence and has also bought her first brand new 650cc bike which she's wanted for many many years. She's over the moon and super excited for it as I am for her. 

Since my 30th is next year I have been on the lookout for ""THE"" bike for many months if not since last year. 
One of the ""dream"" bikes has come about in great condition and a good price and is one of those that probably wont come around again. I have just placed a small holding deposit on it. Albeit nearly 9 months prior to my 30th. 
My worry is am I the asshole for doing this? My partner is supportive of me and thinks it's a good decision to get the bike. 

Am I unintentionally overshadowing my partners joy with her bike? I am absolutely chuffed to bits for her and so proud and happy that she's bought hers. I believe I'm super supportive of her and am genuinely so happy as this is a dream of both of ours to ride together. 
I can't work out if I'm doing it because of the excitement of her getting hers and I unintentionally want in on the action or because I'm already in the process of searching and its OK?

Me:

Good morning, xx. This is yy. I hope all is well. Unfortunately, the soundproof is not very good in our building. We have been hearing walking sound and it’s hard for me to concentrate/sleep. Even it’s just a simple walk, it sounds like someone is knocking on the ceiling. Would you be able to wear some soft slippers if possible? We will be much appreciate it.

Neighbor upstairs:

Hello yy,

As a rule we do not wear shoes inside the apartment but if I did choose to wear them from time to time or my visitors do then this is a choice I think I am entitled to make. 

We are generally very quiet people, do not have parties or late night visitors so perhaps the noises you are hearing are not coming from my apartment but elsewhere! 

Maybe you need to discuss noise levels with the property management company although from various apartments I have lived in around the world this is by far the quietest when it comes to sound proofing aside from the various apartments with barking dogs but that’s an expected part of apartment living! 

Thank you

100,1er40hr,AITA for telling my parents they overlook me all the time?,"I (16f) am the youngest of 5. I'm also the only one of my parents kids left at home. I love my family but there are a lot of times where I feel overlooked by my parents. One reoccurring issue is that my parents always bring up to others that all their kids got to name a sibling. But as the youngest I sure as hell didn't. They bring that up into casual conversation. And it stings to her them say *all their kids* did this because who did I name? Nobody!! And it's true that my siblings all got to name someone. I mentioned how I wished I could name a sibling to my parents a couple of times. They said we'd get a pet in the future and I'd get to name the pet that way it was fair. We got a dog when I was 9. Guess who didn't get to name the pet? In the end my parents decided it needed to be a family vote and not me naming the dog.

They also brag a lot about how accomplished all their kids are and how they all breezed through school. Not me. I struggle. I have learning disabilities so my grades are pretty wonky at the best of times. It stings when they brag because they can't be talking about me. It feels like they forget about me or overlook me.

My oldest sister is expecting her first child. My parents encouraged her to do what they did with future kids and have her kids name each other because ""all of you loved it"". My sister pointed out not everyone did, and what about the fact I was always a little sad about it. They had no idea what she was talking about and said all us kids loved naming each other.

When my family is all together my parents will always get a cake to celebrate. They get a filling that everyone else likes except for me (peanut butter and almond). They describe the cake as being perfect because everyone likes it. If/when I mention that I don't like it they will say they forgot and oh well, I can have a chocolate bar.

This stuff is so frequent that it has built up over time and a couple of days ago I asked to talk to my parents and I mentioned how overlooked I feel by them when they do these things. I also told them it happens frequently enough that I feel like they always overlook me. My parents told me I was being so dramatic and not everything is about me. I told them not everything but surely they can acknowledge I'm their kid too and don't have a younger sibling, so not all their kids got to name one. Or the fact they promised I could name our dog and then decided to go with the popular vote. Or how they talk like every kid they have is amazing in school when they know I struggle.

My parents told me I was being whiney and it wasn't how I should behave at 16.

101,1er3z0p,AITAH for not letting my mom walk me down the aisle? ,"I (26F) let my mother know 1.5 years before my wedding that I will have my uncle walk me down the aisle. 

For context-my dad passed away when I was 9. My brother (28M) & I always had a weird relationship with my mom. She isn’t very motherly, never really connected with us, & after my father died she got a boyfriend who became our stepdad & really focused on him. The stepdad didn’t really have our best interest and mostly cared about himself and their relationship. They had a plan for years to give us the boot as soon as we graduated high school and move off to another state miles away to warmer weather. Navigating through the years after high school and going through college w/out a parent there for us was truly a struggle at times- having the stress of figuring out where to live & not having a parent to lean on. Once they sold our childhood home and left the state, my mom kept in contact, but not too often. They mostly cared about thriving in their new home. I never sensed that feeling of love from my mom, I don’t think either of us have ever really had a heart to heart with her or a serious conversation with her. She has never really listened or cared how we have felt when trying to have those with her. My uncle, (dad’s brother) and his wife have been there for me through it all and have seen how my mom has treated us. They have treated my brother & I like their own. For example: my uncle helped me find my first car in college, was there for me during some health struggles I faced, helped me renovate my first home I bought, and more. Fast forward to 2024. My mom and step dad had divorced in 2018, shes had a couple boyfriends since then. I see her at least once a year, she calls me every couple weeks. The convos we have are still very surface level, and a lot of times she likes to go on about all the fitness activities and what she is doing, and I listen and support her. I still feel like she doesn’t really care about me or genuinely been proud of me. I feel like she really just checked out from being a mom. I guess it feels like she’s a distant friend. My mom has never mentioned she wanted to walk me down the aisle. Once I got in engaged in 2023, I told her right away I would be having my uncle walk me down the aisle, and would honor my mom with a first dance. She was mad and upset at first, but accepted it. Fast forward to a year later, 2 months before my wedding. I am on the phone with w her giving her advice and comforting her bc her bf broke up with her- then at the end of the phone call she says her request is to walk me down the aisle then hangs up. It’s 2 MONTHS before the wedding, why does she need to do this and continue to put guilt onto me? She knows my reasoning for why I chose my uncle, and my mom knows that she hasn’t been a present mom.

102,1er3y2k,AITA for wanting a connection with my biological dad?,"(Throwaway account, my girlfriend is an active Reddit user and I usually use her account to browse the site, but I don't want to drag her online reputation into this.)

I (20M) grew up as the oldest of four siblings and was raised by my biological mother and her husband (early 40s). It's worth noting that my mom's husband isn't my bio dad, and I'm the only child born out of wedlock/not belonging to my step father.

I remember asking my mother about who my real father was growing up and I learned that he basically was an old lover who knew I existed but wanted nothing to do with me. The only involvement he had, to his credit, was apparently paying child support. It took a bit of digging on my own time and a lot of poking at my mom for clues as to who he was, but eventually I found my biological dad online.

I reached out to him not too long ago and explained that I was his biological son from my mother and asked if he'd like to meet up to talk. To his credit, he answered me at all. But he made it very clear that it was a no. I tried explaining my situation to him and that I would just like to at least text back and forth for a little to get to know my real father and I said that if he didn't care for me at all he wouldn't have paid child support for me, so what's the harm in at least getting to know him a little? This clearly upset him and he basically said that I ""didn't know the conditions of my birth, so to stop bothering him about it"" and that he ""paid his dues"" and ""his involvement with me has been long done and to just move on.""

I'm really bummed and I want to try and talk to my mom more to find out what could have happened and if she maybe could get us in touch, but my girlfriend says I overstepped a boundary by reaching out to him and that I was being rude. She said I was basically stalking him and to leave him alone, but I don't know. Is it wrong to want to know the man who you share DNA with?

103,1er3rh4,"AITA for still going to see a show, even though another girl couldn't afford it?","So, I'll start with a bit of backstory:
Recently I (18F) participated in a project that allowed me to go to New York for 10 days.

Since I'm a big musical nerd I suggested to the group I was with that during one night we could go and see a Broadway show.

Three people said yes, let's say their names were Crissy(19F) Ethan (19M) and Alice(18F).

While I didn't know Crissy or Ethan prior to this trip I'm in the same class as Alice, however we never really interacted before, as we simply have nothing in common.

So, we make a group chat to coordinate the details and Alice make a point to say that she doesn't have a big budget (like around 90 dollars and not more)
We say fine, and start searching for something we would like that is in that price range.

In the end we choose a show and we buy our tickets, after that I write on the chat “Ok, got the tickets” and the other three all react to my message with a thumbs up.

After that I don't really think about the situation anymore, until we arrive at the night of the show where Alice admits that she doesn't have a ticket because they were too expensive.

By this point I was already fed up with Alice for other reasons, specifically that she's the worst roommate ever, I'm talking having food delivered to our room at 
2 A.M. and loudly talking on the phone at the same time (she also mocked me for my stimming, but I'm used to that, so that's not really exclusive to her) so I simply say something along the line of 
“Ok, I'm sorry, now let's go”

However both Crissy and Ethan decide that it's not fair to go if Alice can't and that I should also not go in solidarity.

Honestly by this point I didn't give a fuck anymore and just decide to go anyway cause fuck it, I payed for my ticket and I was looking forward to it.

I watched the show and it was amazing, however when I returned to the hotel after it I found out that many of Alice's friends (who are our classmates) started texting me that what I did was really rude.

So now I'm conflicted, AITA?

I listened to her for around 20 minutes and she told me I was being quiet. My response was that she clearly needed to vent and I didn't want to interject. That was mostly true but I also think my sister is a little insane for thinking she'd get to have a nice neat little family given the craziness in her family.

For context: My sister had her first child at 18, my nephew Shane (18m). She dated Shane's dad for a while and found out when Shane was 1 that her boyfriend had another girl pregnant and so they broke up. My sister and the other mother both got arrested for fighting. And she swore she would never let that woman or her child near Shane. She got married at 21 and had two more kids Kadie (15f) and Rye (13m). She filed for divorce straight after Rye was born and her ex-husband is nowhere in sight since. A year later she met another man, who had a baby with someone. My niece Lily (12f) is not my sister's bio child but she raises her as her own (though unofficially since she's not adopted). Kadie got married again had Milo (9m) with that husband and got pregnant with Sage (7f) while married but her ex-husband is not the father. Her youngest bio (so far) is Nile (5m) and his father is not in the picture either.

My sister is married again. Her husband has two kids from his first marriage and two kids from his second marriage. He also has a child in his life who is not his biological kid. Doesn't get along with his biological kids. But he treats this child like his own.

The household has many complicated relationships and divided loyalties. There are complications with some of the other parents involved and other children involved. It's too long and complicated to get involved in. But even among my sisters children, they are not all cohesive close siblings and some resentments exist for one reason or another.

Anyway, Lily was venting to me. She said nobody she knows has a family so incapable of getting together as hers. She asked me why I thought that was and I said very blended families are more complex. She told me there are people with bigger blended families than hers. I told her bigger doesn't always mean having as many others involved as hers. Then she said again they're all a family though and they act like they don't want to be and that's when I said probably because it's more of a circus than a family.

My sister told me that was really unkind and untrue, that they are a family, even if others can't see it. She told me she expects an apology from me before we can speak again.

Then she said again they're all a family though and they act like they don't want to be and that's when I said probably because it's more of a circus than a family.

My sister told me that was really unkind and untrue, that they are a family, even if others can't see it. She told me she expects an apology from me before we can speak again.

105,1er3bnx,AITA for returning my boyfriend’s gift of used AirPods?,"Recently, I (23F) lost my 3rd gen AirPods at work. I mentioned it to my boyfriend (27M) while we were talking about our days. I would continue to mention it here and there because of how inconvenient I was while working. I wasn’t expecting him to buy me new pairs at all. I made it known to him that I was planning on getting new pairs by my next pay check. However, he decided to get me new pairs. I was very very grateful for the gift. Thankfully, I found my AirPods again a couple days before the package was expected to arrive. I told him that I would give the new pair of AirPods that he gave me to my mother since she was needing one as well. 

When the package arrived, I realized that they were used 2nd gen Airpods. Now, the two “problems” I had with them were 1. I was going to replace my 3rd Gen AirPods, not 2nd gen. 2. They were used and I’m not sure if I’m a fan of that. I asked him just to confirm things and made sure to tell him that there’s nothing wrong if they’re used but I just wanted to know. He responded with “I always buy used ones. I’m sorry I’m broke and if you don’t like them can you return them so I can get my refund.” I feel like an asshole for not necessarily liking his gift because it’s a gift afterall. I told him not to be sorry and that I was thankful regardless. The issue that I took to his response was the “I’m broke”. I never asked him to buy me new AirPods but I was genuinely thankful by his kind gesture regardless. And he’s not broke lol. He’s actually doing very very well financially so that was a bit weird to me.

I will be returning them so he gets the full refund and getting new ones for myself later. But this also made me look at him a little differently and I’m not sure if that’s valid of me to do so.

She'd rather be playing basketball with her friends.

But then we got to know each other better. We found out we both have daddy issues. My dad only says this when drunk but unfortunately he is drunk several times a week.

We deal with it in different ways. I bury myself in books while she turns to sports. She became nicer, stopped belittling me and we became friends.

Anyway, I recently confided in her that I have a crush.

I'm a recent college graduate and managed to land a great job that will serve to be a strong steppingstone for my professional career both in terms of experience, and workplace connections.

108,1er2pi3,AITA for offering to share my room with my 13-year-old twin sisters during a short family vacation instead of having them share one with our cousins?,"
I’m 17, and during a recent short family vacation, my parents wanted me to have my own room, so they planned for my 13-year-old twin sisters, Hanna and Anne, to share a room with our cousins, who are about the same age. When Hanna and Anne found out about this arrangement, they said they’d feel much more comfortable if they shared a room with me instead.

I offered to let them stay with me because they seemed really anxious about sharing with the cousins. I told my parents I was fine with it, even though they were initially set on the twins sharing with the cousins. They eventually agreed, recognizing that it would be better for Hanna and Anne.

So, during the vacation, Hanna and Anne ended up sharing a room with me. One night, while I was lying on the bed watching my phone, Hanna asked if she could cuddle. I said yes, and then Anne joined in, snuggling up beside us. It was honestly the sweetest thing ever. Even though they’re teens, they still seek their big brother’s comfort, and I really enjoy having them close. I want them to feel comfortable and know they can always tell me anything or ask for anything.

Some family members are now saying I’m enabling them by making them too dependent on me and that I should have let them adjust to sharing with the cousins. They think it’s strange that I enjoyed having them close.

I don’t see it as enabling; I just think they’re old enough to decide if they want their own space or choose who they’re comfortable sharing with. It’s about respecting their comfort during this vacation and being there for my little sisters.

109,1er2p9x,AITA for declining to watch my friend’s dog?,"My (F26) friend (F39) asked me months ago if I could watch her dog for a few days during her upcoming vacation. There was a serious possibility that my husband and I would be moving soon, so I told my friend I wasn't sure if I'd still be in town at that time, and didn't want to commit if I wouldn't be able to do it. 

She kept asking every couple of weeks. I told her as nicely as I could that it would be best to find someone else. 

If it matters, I have watched her dog before for 10 days in my home. Her dog was a bouncy puppy then, and my dog is a skittish foster dog from a local shelter. Her dog is full-grown now, and very nippy and much more wild than my foster dog. Her dog bit at my dog and actually bit my nose (marking the first time a dog had ever made me bleed) when I watched him as a puppy. I expected him to outgrow his teething problems, and she insists she is working on training. But, I see her dog often enough to see that he still has a rough playing style, which concerns me now that he is bigger than my foster dog.

For the record- I don't think her dog is mean, he is just not respectful of my dog's boundaries and I don't think my friend is being respectful of mine.

Again, I had been suggesting for months that she find someone else to watch her dog, but she did not even attempt to make other arrangements. I had multiple reasons for saying no, I just thought one reason would suffice, but once I learned that I would not be moving by the date of her trip, and she asked again, I explained to her my other reasons. This is something that is hard for me, so she is always telling me things like, ""it's okay to say no to people, you don't owe anyone any explanations"", so it just confuses me that she has not spoken to me ever since I told her no, which was weeks ago. (We live in the same neighborhood and often speak and spend time together).

I made it clear that I know her dog is not mean when I expressed my concerns. He just plays roughly and I don't want the foster dog I am already responsible for under any extra stress.  

Am I the asshole here? Is there an asshole here? Should I have given her a whole slew of reasons from the start as to why I wasn't comfortable watching her dog? Or should I have just said ""no"" with no reasons at all? Should I have offered a compromise of sorts, such as watching her dog in her home since I didn't want him in mine? We do live in an area with ample options for pet-sitting, but I would have been willing to work out a compromise had she responded to me, rather than ignoring me entirely. We may just be drifting apart as friends, I don't know, but I feel bad about it all :/ Any perspective would be appreciated, thanks.

I had mentioned it to him a couple times but never wanted to tell him to stop ( we were so new) and I just thought the fact that it was clearly affecting my health he would be considerate and stop. 

Well we left the Philippines and he stopped having the ability to smoke in doors so it stopped being a problem.

113,1er11rz,AITA for telling my husband there’s something suspicious about his text messages?,"
my husband is a doctor and he’s becoming chief so he gets texts from his coworkers. One female coworker texted him that she had a “sex related question” with laugh emojis. He told me it was about a patient but I looked at his face and he couldn’t come up with an answer for what the question was about. Then another day she was asking about switching call days and then said thanks and sent him heart emojis.

He told me it was about a patient but I looked at his face and he couldn’t come up with an answer for what the question was about. Then another day she was asking about switching call days and then said thanks and sent him heart emojis.

114,1er0hdw,AITA for not going to my step daughters graduation? ,"I'm in a bit of a dilemma and could use some outside perspective. My stepdaughter is graduating from college in December. However, I’ve decided not to attend the graduation ceremony.

Here’s the background: my relationship with my stepdaughter has been strained for quite some time. We don’t have a close bond, and there have been ongoing issues between us. It’s mainly because she doesn’t want me dating her mother since she still wants her father to be with her. I get that. I have always respected her and never pushed her boundaries or felt disrespected by her not liking me. I am also the product of divorced parents and I didn’t like my own step mother. So, I’ve always understood that no matter how hard I tried there would be no relationship. And that’s ok. I don’t want to force something that’s not and I don’t want to ever be a reason her and her mother aren’t close. 

 I feel like attending the graduation would be better for my step daughter as she can enjoy her incredible accomplishment with her family and friends. I don’t want to be the damper and when she sees me, it always changes her mood. I understand my wife wants me to go to support her but she’ll have her mother their and her sister. Given our current relationship I don’t want to ruin her day. I thought about reaching out to my step daughter and asking her how she felt about me going. But she probably wouldn’t even respond to a text or call. 

My partner, her mother, is obviously upset and feels that it’s important for family to support each other at significant events like this. She thinks that by not going, I’m showing a lack of support and interest in her achievements … which isn’t true at all. I’ve explained my perspective 100 times over but she doesn’t seem to get I am doing this for my step daughter. 

I’m conflicted because I don’t want to hurt anyone, but I also don’t want to force myself into a situation that feels like I would be ruining one of the most important days in a persons life.

So, AITA for deciding not to go to my stepdaughter’s graduation?


UPDATE: Asked my partner to ask her daughter how she felt. I also sent her a text this morning and awaiting a reply. Thanks for the replies you guys. I wasn’t trying to take an easy way out by not texting my step daughter or communicating with her. She’s an adult. I want to respect her boundaries and not overstep. My stepdaughters father will be there and so will his family (his mother, father and brothers family) They are really nice to me and very cordial. Her father isn’t seeing anyone so he will just be there with his family - for those wondering. I will post another update once I get a response from my partner or stepdaughter. Thank you!

116,1eqzyxl,AITA for locking myself in a room during a birthday party,"I'm 21F and so is my stepsister. We grew up in the same house. My ex is also 21 and we grew up on the same street as her. My stepsister and I were always good friends with her before we started dating at 15. We broke up when we were 19. Throughout the entire time stepsis and ex girlfriend remained friends. Which I don't have a problem with at all as they have always been close. 

My stepsisters birthday was on saturday. Our parents have a pretty decent sized backyard so this is where the party took place. I told her that it was ok if she wanted to invite my ex since they grew up together and were always great friends. Anyways I show up to the party with my one-year old daughter and my boyfriend. And she brings along her new gf (I don't really care because I have moved on from that relationship. But stepsis thinks it was weird she was there bc she wasn't invited).

When my ex saw me she was like ""oh I didn't know you were straight now and have a whole ass child"". She literally knew I was bi the entire relationship. I just tried to sit as far away from her as possible. But honestly I think she was jelly bc I have a new family.

At some point the baby started getting really fussy and wouldn't calm down. We think it may have been because of the heat and try to take her in the house and calm her down. She still wouldn't stop crying so my bf offered to take her home for a nap. So he took her leaving me with no car and said that he would pick me up at the end of the party.

I went back outside and hear my ex talking to her girlfriend. She was like ""can you believe I dated that. I upgraded to you and she downgraded to that weirdo"".

She starts behaving wildly inappropriately. She started full on making out with her partner and was at one point basically giving her a lap dance. There were kids here (family friends' kids and relatives) including our 5 year old brother. I walk up to her and ask ""can you please not do that in front of my brother?"" She said ""we broke up. don't tell me what to do"".

I ask my stepsis (the host of the party) if she could have her leave or at least have the girlfriend leave because she wasn't invited. She basically said she didn't want to start drama. I am not mad at her for this at all. My stepsister has really bad social anxiety especially surrounding confrontation and avoids them at all costs.

I went inside to my childhood bedroom because I needed space.My stepmom comes in asking if I'm going to come back outside. I tell her I need some space so she leaves. She comes back 5 minutes later asking the same thing and I tell her to go away. I then close the door and lock it. I stay in there until my boyfriend knocks on the door and takes me home.

117,1eqzfph,AITA for not driving on this road trip?,"2 friends and I took a road trip last week. Even before the trip started there were some differing opinions about where exactly we wanted to go (ie a destination 1 hour away vs 3 hours away).  One guy (let's call him Mark) offered to drive us for the trip, but he wanted to go to the closer destination because driving 6 hours just for a day trip would be super exhausting for him. Friend #2 (let's call him John) really wanted to go to the far away location, kept insisting we have to go there and shut down any other opinions. I stayed flexible although I also had a preference for the closer destination. But we both got shut down when trying to express that preference (as both Mark and I are more of the peacekeeping types). Ultimately we both said ok. 

Once we are all packed up in the car ready for the trip, John says ""so we're going to [the far away place] right?"" I say I don't care, that's fine, and the dude driving just stays quiet. 

We go on the trip and it all goes pretty well. We have a great time and there's no inclination of animosity. However, after the trip, Mark (driver) calls John and tells him that he is upset, extremely disappointed that we didn't help him drive and that doing 6 hours of driving just for a day trip made him too exhausted for work tomorrow. There is now a pretty big rift between Mark and John. John is now saying Mark was being immature for getting mad, because he had never asked us to drive and never said anything in the moment if he was uncomfortable. We obviously apologized (and paid all gas+parking) but it kind of soured the entire trip and the friendship.

10yo thinks, hey that was pretty amusing, so she wanted to share this little laugh with family. We live in a different country, so we encourage our older kid to be in touch often even with silly little things so she can maintain a connection. 

Well, after receiving this video, she sends my spouse a message asking why exactly our daughters were sending her a video flipping her off. Even after writing back that it was a silly little joke, she asked that we please ask our daughter to stop messaging her.

They are not biologically mine, however they are still my family. I care for them and fight for them as my own children. The Groom has always had issues with my partner, though extensive digging from countless friends and family has never yielded any actual reasons why. The bride is unperturbed. 

We should have been attending the wedding of my sibling next month, however when the invitations were sent last year, I noted that it only included myself, my partner and my bio daughter. I obviously bought this up and the consensus was - “The children who received invites, are the only children we would like to attend”Broad? Yep, I know. For reference, there are about 10 children set to attend with ages varying from 8 months - 17 years. 
Also for reference, the bride and groom have been dating for a little over 3 years - that’s right, not even half as long as my beautiful SK have been a part of my life (this means nothing in the way of the future longevity of their relationship, but merely highlights I am not asking to bring the children of a casual hookup). It is a strong belief that this move was calculated, as SK not attending would also mean my partner wouldn’t be able to attend. I am not about to argue why they should be invited, as it’s not my wedding day and I don’t believe I should get a say in the guest list. I simply opted for none of my family attend, unless the invitation was extended to all of us. As you can imagine this did not go down well.

121,1eqzc0s,AITA for Telling My Wife Not to Act Like a Mother to My Son?,"

I (36M) married my wife (34F) four years ago. I have a son (16M) from a previous relationship, and she has a son (16M) as well. When we got married, I made it clear to her that I didn’t want her to try to be a mother to my son. I thought it would be simpler and avoid potential conflicts, and she agreed. She did ask if I was sure, and I was.

My wife is a strong woman at 5'10"" with a well-paying job, and she shares household expenses with me. Despite this, she still has plenty of money to spend on her son, who is 6'2"". They share a strong bond and train together at the gym since my wife is into MMA. Their relationship is both tough and gentle—she pushes him to be his best but also rewards him with things he likes, such as Pokémon booster boxes, fragrances, shoes, and other things when he hits milestones in school or training. Her son also has a Chihuahua mix dog that he takes care of, and my wife makes it clear that it’s her son’s dog and he’s responsible for it. Additionally, she takes her son to work with her on weekends when he doesn’t have school, spending extra time with him.

Meanwhile, my son has become increasingly jealous of the attention and affection her son receives. He sees her son getting all these rewards and the close relationship they share, while he gets little to no attention from her. For example, on her son’s last birthday, she gifted him a Versace fragrance, a $100 gift card, two Pokémon booster boxes, and skincare products, which all probably added up to at least $500. On the other hand, my son only receives one gift from her on his birthday, like a pair of shoes or a book. My wife has made it clear that she only gives one gift for people’s birthdays who aren’t her son’s.

Recently, while the kids were at school, my wife and I went shopping together. In the jewelry section, she mentioned that she was planning to buy an expensive necklace for her son’s 17th birthday or high school graduation. She was looking at some of the most expensive pieces, and I was surprised because I don’t even know if I could afford some of those necklaces as a gift for my son. She suggested that I should probably buy a similar gift for my son as well.

I tried to talk to my wife about it, telling her how my son feels and how it’s affecting him. But she was firm in her response, saying that it’s my responsibility as his father to address his needs and that she won’t interfere in my parenting, just like I asked. She also pointed out that maybe if she had gotten close with him four years ago when we first got married, things might be different, but now he’s 16, and it’s too late for that kind of relationship to develop. She also noted that I don’t have a fatherly relationship with her son, and he seems to be just fine.

I (36M) married my wife (34F) four years ago. I have a son (16M) from a previous relationship, and she has a son (16M) as well. When we got married, I made it clear to her that I didn’t want her to try to be a mother to my son. I thought it would be simpler and avoid potential conflicts, and she agreed. She did ask if I was sure, and I was.

My wife is a strong woman at 5'10"" with a well-paying job, and she shares household expenses with me. Despite this, she still has plenty of money to spend on her son, who is 6'2"". They share a strong bond and train together at the gym since my wife is into MMA. Their relationship is both tough and gentle—she pushes him to be his best but also rewards him with things he likes, such as Pokémon booster boxes, fragrances, shoes, and other things when he hits milestones in school or training. Her son also has a Chihuahua mix dog that he takes care of, and my wife makes it clear that it’s her son’s dog and he’s responsible for it. Additionally, she takes her son to work with her on weekends when he doesn’t have school, spending extra time with him.

122,1eqz4z2,AITA for having my fiance's brothers ex as my bridesmaid?,"My fiancée, Oliver, and I met in June 2019. Oliver has two siblings, David and Nora. Oliver was in the US from Australia for six months for a course for work, and that’s how we met. We did a long distance relationship for most of our first year. Oliver’s brother David, is in the same field as Oliver, and went to the US to do the same course. At that time, David was in a relationship with Abby, but they faced difficulties due to the long distance. Abby, close to Oliver’s family, sought my advice since Oliver and I successfully navigated a long-distance relationship. However, David ended up cheating on Abby with a girl in the US (Jane), leading to their breakup. Abby and I remained friends, and when I moved to Aus, we became best friends. In 2021, Oliver’s entire family, including Abby, attended a concert. When David and Jane, who had by then moved to Aus, found out Abby was there, they left immediately, making things awkward for the rest of us. 

Oliver proposed to me in October 2022, and two weeks later, David proposed to Jane. I was happy for them, but I felt irritated that it happened so close to our engagement. We booked our wedding venue in November 2023 for July 2025, and a month later, David and Jane announced they would be getting married in August 2024. For some reason, this rubbed me the wrong way. David and Jane planned a small wedding in the US, as Jane’s grandmother couldn’t travel to Aus. Since moving to Aus, Jane hasn’t made any friends, and she only reaches out to Oliver’s sister, Nora, not me. Jane asked Nora to be a bridesmaid, and when it came time for wedding dress shopping, she only invited Nora. One weekend, Nora mentioned that they were going shoe shopping for Jane the following weekend and suggested I join. I felt upset because Jane didn’t invite me herself, and it felt last minute, so I declined. When the wedding invites went out a month before their wedding, it was addressed only to Oliver, not to me. They knew I wasn’t coming because we couldn’t afford for both of us to go, but I thought it would have been courteous to include me. Jane blamed this oversight on her mother, but I wasn’t convinced. She sent me flowers to apologize.

Now that Jane and David are married, Oliver and I are fully focused on planning our wedding. I asked Abby, my best friend here, to be one of my bridesmaids, and she has already bought her dress. Recently, Oliver and I spent time with his parents, and his father told Oliver that having Abby at our wedding would make him and Oliver’s mother uncomfortable. Oliver, visibly upset, later told me what his parents had said, essentially asking me to uninvite Abby. Oliver was near tears as he didn’t want to ask me and felt caught in the middle again.

123,1eqz2xo,WIBTA for considering reporting my friend to his job for potentially spreading bedbugs?,"


I (30M) have a complicated situation with a ""friend"" (let's call him John, 32M) that I've known for a while. We used to live in the same apartment complex, which had a serious bedbug infestation. I ended up breaking my lease due to multiple issues, including the bedbugs, and took matters into my own hands by treating my place with Crossfire and Gentrol because I co-parent and didn't want my son getting bitten.

Throughout this time, John kept wanting to hang out at my place, but I was really worried about the bedbugs spreading, especially since he doesn’t take great care of himself (like, he literally wears the same pants every day and doesn't shower regularly). I eventually got bitten again and asked John to chip in for treatment costs, which he didn’t.

Fast forward to now, I’ve moved into a new penthouse and have been super careful to avoid any bedbug issues. John convinced me that he didn’t have them anymore because another friend who visited him didn’t get bitten, so I set up a double date and let him come by for a bit—though I made sure he didn’t sit on my couch or stay long. Despite my precautions, I got bitten again, and John later admitted he found one on him.

When I told him about my concerns—especially regarding my son’s safety—his only response was “damn...” and then when I asked him to cover the treatment again, he just said, “add it to my tab.”

Now here’s where I feel stuck. John actually helped me out a lot when I was homeless, and I feel like I owe him for that, but at the same time, I can’t overlook how careless he’s being. He works as a contractor for Comcast, and he wears the same unwashed clothes every day. I’m seriously worried that he’s spreading bedbugs to the homes he visits for work, which is a risk to other families. 

WIBTA if I reported him to Comcast for possibly bringing bedbugs into other people’s houses? I don’t want to be petty, but this is affecting my life and potentially others’ too.

124,1eqz1m3,AITA for voicing my concerns about my son to my in laws?,"AITA for voicing my concerns to my in laws about my son

My wife (26F) and I (26M) have a 1 year old son. My wife’s parents live 2.5 hours away but they consciously want to have a good relationship with our son. 

This weekend was going to be their first time taking care of our son without us. They plan to stay at a hotel with our son.

Before checking in the hotel that day they spent the morning with us and our son. This is where  flags were raised for me and my wife. 
The flags raised were: 

1. When my FIL was watching my son walking around on a couch my FIL was watching his phone  instead of watching him attentively because he easily can fall

2. They left my son unattended with a plate full of food. MIL left my FIL with my son and my FIL was sleeping while son had a plate with berries and cheerios

We voiced our concerns that has happened and we just simply reminded them that we would like it if if they were watching our son not to be on your phone and be more attentive and if he was eating not to leave him unattended.

My FIL told me that he was only “half asleep” but when I went outside to check on them he did not even know I was in the room with them. My MIL told me that the berries were cutup small and that she deals with kids my son’s age all the time and that my son means the world to them and I should trust them. They did not say “okay we will not leave you child unattended while eating”. Instead, it was things like “we are his grandparents you need to trust us!” 

Now I stated that I am the type of person where people have to gain my trust vs giving someone my trust initially. My in laws took offence to this and felt like I dont trust them. When I really was not attacking them personally I just told them how I operate with trust. I apologized to them for offending them and tried to make it clear that it was not a personal attack but just how I think. But they really took offence to the point where they ended up not taking our son for the night.

There was a part where I personally feel disrespected by my in laws. In the hotel they are planning to co-with our son. Me and my wife don’t agree with co-sleeping and offered to pay the hotel for an extra crib. My in laws told me no on getting the crib around 4 times in a back and forth. 

At this point I just feel like they are not respecting our wishes as parents.

Now me and my wife are also on disagreeing terms because she believes that both sides are magnifying the disrespect on both sides but me personally I feel that my in laws are the ones who are doing the disrespecting. 

Now AITA for being so firm about my son to my in laws?

We asked her if she was searching for a place to stay and she said yes but they were all out of her budget that would accept her animals.  The reason I am asking if I am the asshole is she has been crying off and on since the night we talked with her. This hadn't been the first time my husband had talked with her asking when she could pay rent or that he felt disrespected by her. 

P.S. This was the first time I had talked with her due to wanting to keep the renting and friendship separate.",2.0,0.04910033941268921,0,0

I (28F) spoke to my friend (29M) about possibly meeting up at a park with our kids 2 days ago*.  I said it probably wouldn't happen because I already had other plans.  I said to plan your day as if my answer was no, I don't assume that I will be there.  Yesterday I went and did my plans.  I also forgot my phone at my parents' house; unbeknownst to me it fell out of my purse and I didn't realize I didn't have it with me until I got to my first stop.

During this time, my friend apparently texted me pictures of his kid at the park, which I didn't respond to because I didn't have my phone.  I saw the pictures when I got home but I just put my phone aside without answering because I was busy carrying in packages from shopping, etc and I just forgot about it.

Later that night I messaged my friend and he didn't respond; tbh I thought maybe he had fallen asleep.  Then today I noticed he hadn't responded to anything and so I jokingly said something about him getting lost in the woods at the park.

One of my friends told me that the teacher thought me and D were dating because during our breaks in between his class when we got to walk around the school for around five to ten minutes at a time, and we would just hangout and talk to each other and we both enjoyed each others company. We live in a small town and we both lived pretty close to the school and we would either walk or bike to school. And one day after school we hangout and thats when i sort of developed a crush on him. Then one day we were just talking after school by the football field and he tried to prop my head onto his lap but i wasn’t very comfortable so i tried to get up. When we were done with summer school and actually in high school as freshmen we would say hi to each other when we saw each other in the hallway, but other then that we didn’t talk to each other much but i still had a crush on him. Then the summer going into sophomore year, i added him to a group chat with my friends and long story short, we went to a fair together and i noticed he was really close to one of my female friends lets call her “T”. Anytime D wanted to go on a ride, he would obviously sit by T, which kinda made me jealous because she knew i liked him, and they just kept getting close and talking to each other. I told my friends that knew i had a crush on D that D and T were getting pretty close but they said i had nothing to worry about. The next week i find out that they have actually started dating which broke my trust with T.

I then had another friend of mine tell D that ive liked him, long story short we talked and i confessed my feelings knowing it was too late and i was upset but i didn’t want to make D feel guilty.

I started being a bit petty and saying “i hope they have a wonderful relationship” and “they are so cute together” which anyone could tell i was being petty.

Then i get a random text saying “you’re being petty and a pick me, i’ve never liked you never gave you hints that i liked you, ect.” I was so angry because i thought of all the times we hung out and how he tried putting my head on his lap and all the things he had done.

132,1eqxszb,AITA for moving out and leaving my best friend in “our” house of 6 years? ,"Six years ago I bought a house for myself, my best girlfriend, and her young daughter. My bff was struggling as a single mom and I wasn’t doing so hot, either. We thought living together would provide a good support system emotionally and financially. Unfortunately, she had a bad credit score and could not go in on a joint mortgage. The house was put in my name and we split expenses, including the mortgage.  We acquired dogs, stuff, etc. A very lovely family! In a couple years my friend was able to eliminate her medical debt and get a higher-paying job. We’ve both been up and down with our mental health, but generally have been on an upward trajectory. 

Over time the relationship between my friend and I has soured a little. She says I am brash and critical of her. I say she is emotional and resentful of any of my successes. (She makes snide comments about me trying to be healthy or getting a promotion at work, etc.) I’ve been really patient with her outbursts because I know her childhood was rough and full of trauma. Also, I’m admittedly blunt and sometimes hard to get along with. We’ve gone to some therapy sessions to try to strengthen our communication. I still feel the need to walk on eggshells around her because I never know when she’s going to start yelling or crying. Recently I pointed out that she cannot technically own our house because in the eyes of the law she’s renting from me. She was very offended by this and accused me of trying to treat her like a tenant instead of a friend. She has relied heavily on me to cover expenses if she is short, but does always pay me back. I just feel taken advantage of and I’m over it. 

Today I suggested I move out to an apartment. I can’t swing the full mortgage and rent, but thought she’d up her portion of the payment a little and cover utilities. I also said we can sell the house and split the profits. (The property has gone up in value significantly.) She’s refusing both of these suggestions and says she’ll pay half plus utilities because that’s what we agreed to long term. She asked how I could dare break up our family without considering her. If I do this I don’t love her and we can’t be friends. (😬)

Honestly, I’ve covered her half of the rent for 2 months and could probably evict her even without a formal lease, but I can deal with the money part later. AITA for even considering moving out?

We are very close (due to being twins) but also have a very toxic relationship. I always put her first and will do anything she asks of me and it really has been all about her since 2020 with her engagement, wedding and now pregnancy.

Last month - I got invited on an incredible trip to see a part of the country I have never seen - for three days. The trip was going to be 10 days after my sister's due date - and as someone who does not have kids, or know many pregnant people, I truly had NO idea it's common to be more than a week late. I absolutely assumed the baby would be here - but I did buy trip insurance in case.

Well - now the baby is going to be born at 42 weeks (and she is scheduled to be induced the day after my trip). I really, really did not anticipate this - and I found out the insurance I got doesn't cover it, nor can I cancel the ticket for a refund, credit or change fee (also, I never have canceled a flight before) I just made some stupid, non researched choices.

I have basically two choices:

A) Cancel the trip with no refund, stay home and hope the baby comes over the weekend (but she may not come at all til induction)

B) Go on trip this weekend, and potentially miss the birth by a day or 2 (or not at all if she isn't born).

Initially my sister did not want anyone at the birth, then only the grandparents; a few months ago she told me I could come for an hour or so- now she's saying - ""Go on the trip - it's not your baby!"" and basically on the flipside how dare I miss this...

 I absolutely did not anticipate this - it is the only trip I have taken this summer and I really thought she'd be born by now. I feel just absolutely sick about going and missing the labor, and sad about staying and potentially throwing a trip away that I could have gone on. I know it's absolutely out of my hands.

I was laying on the couch resting when she came home today at 9:30ish. Her dog was excited and jumped down from the couch to to greet her. In the process, she snagged my face. My mom was laughing at me till we saw blood all over my hands which were holding my face from the pain.

We got into an argument where I blamed her for never being home when she has the chance to, but now I feel like I might just be a bit harsh since work does take up most of her day and maybe I couldve tried more to cut the fronts on my own. AITA?

140,1eqvsq8,AITA for telling my husband he can't do laundry during the day? ,"Relatively low stakes situation, but we'd love perspective on who the asshole is here...

I (30F) used to be the primary earner (95% of our income) in my relationship with my (34M) husband in a miserable corporate job. I left said job to start another company a few months ago (joint decision). Our income has since dropped by \~90%, which means we're now on a tighter budget. Both of us work full time (50+ hours/week), though most of my work hours are now sweat equity.

With the lower income, its been a lifestyle shift.

A big change is that we got a roommate in the house who has taken over 2 of 4 rooms in the house: the room that used to be my office, and the room that used to be his gym. We tried to have me move into husbands office upstairs, but he's very loud (loud voice and doesn't want to move to another room for calls) and I'm sensitive to noise. After about a week, he half jokingly said that I should just work out of the garage/laundry room if I was so sensitive to noise.

So...I did. I took the next 5 days off and spent it painstakingly clearing all the empty boxes, donating past roommates junk, organizing everything, and buying rugs/furniture on the cheap from craigslist to make the garage really nice. This garage went from being a cluttered storage unit to actually being a really nice home gym + work area + second living room + storage. Its not as nice as the office he uses, but its nice enough to work out of. We also now use it as a hangout area now on hot evenings.

Husband really hasn't been thrilled about this garage conversion, and its been a point of tension. He feels like I've basically taken over a chunk of the house for myself without asking him, while I feel like I've been banished to a tiny corner of the house that keeps getting tinier. We got into a fight when I asked him to be quiet in the garage if he's going to use it during the day (9-5) on days I work from home (2x/week). This ask included asking him to not do laundry since our laundry machine is old/broken and sounds like its going to take off into space when its run. I've asked husband if he's be open to swapping ""offices"", but he likes the upstairs one.

143,1eqvouc,AITA for telling my parents I won’t attend their 30th anniversary party if they invite my estranged brother?,"(new account because my family knows my reddit account )

I (27F) have been estranged from my older brother, Mark (33M), for the past five years. We used to be close growing up, but our relationship deteriorated when he stole a significant amount of money from me( 25 000$). Without going into too much detail, Mark was going through a rough patch and convinced me to lend him a large sum of money, which he promised to pay back within a year. I agreed because he was family, and I trusted him. But he never paid me back.

When I finally confronted him about it, he blew up at me, calling me selfish and accusing me of not caring about his struggles. It turned into a huge fight, and we haven’t spoken since. My parents tried to mediate, but Mark refused to apologize or even acknowledge that he did anything wrong. They’ve been stuck in the middle ever since, and it’s put a strain on our family.

Fast forward to now, my parents are planning a big celebration for their 30th wedding anniversary and they’ve invited both me and Mark. When I saw the whatsapp group I was shocked to see that Mark was included. I called my parents to talk about it, and they told me they’re hoping this party could be an opportunity for us to reconcile. They think enough time has passed and that we should stop '' acting like kids '' as my mother said

I was really upset by this. I explained to them that I’m still hurt by what Mark did and that I’m not ready to be in the same room as him, let alone celebrate with him. I told them that if Mark is going to be there, I won’t be attending. My parents were disappointed and tried to convince me to reconsider, saying that family is more important than money and that holding onto grudges wont do anyone any good. Theyy said it would break their hearts if one of us wasn’t at their anniversary party.

Since then, my parents have been distant with me, and I can tell they’re hurt. I don’t want to cause them any more pain, but I also don’t want to be forced into a situation where I have to pretend everything is fine with Mark when it’s not. My friends are divided on this—some think I’m right to stand my ground, while others think I’m being too stubborn and should go for the sake of my parents.

My boyfriend is really upset, and feels I am choosing the cat over him. He feels like all of our future plans have changed, that living together isn’t possible and that I’m choosing my cat over his health. I’m willing to try all of the things to reduce allergies. New cat food, dander treatments, air purifiers, daily cleaning, etc. I will do everything I need to do to try to make it comfortable for everyone, but I do feel like I need to keep the promise I made when adopting her and give her the best life I can.

 I told my niece to tell my uncle that I’m busy and I can’t but my niece came back and told me that my uncle wants to talk to me. I go into the living room and instantly he start yelling about how disrespectful I am, how I need to start acting like a woman, how I’m too American etc etc.

He wanted to say something back but I just went in my room.

146,1eqvgg1,AITA for buying my friend a new wardrobe?,"A little context, I’ve known said kid let’s call her layla for privacy reasons, since the 8th grade. She was always really introverted and to herself, I assumed maybe she was just shy and left her alone. Fast forward to my junior year and her and I had a lot of classes together.

She was on the lonelier side, I could tell she really wanted to connect with people. I’d see her constantly offering people gum or just making small talk. The sad part was that everyone thought she was weird so yeah they were nice whenever she’d offer them something, but behind her back they’d all make fun of her. 

Mostly because of how she dressed, like not to be an asshole but she dressed a lot younger than what she was. It was like she has dressed the same since the 4th grade. Like she’d wear jojo bows and justice at 16.

So I made it my mission to help her, I started off slowly talking to her more in class and working with her if we had a group project. Eventually we became really good friends. She was actually really cool when you got to know her, yeah she’s not the best at socializing but she’s funny asf and I love that about her.

Fast forward to a couple months into our friendship, and I found her hysterically crying in the bathroom stall. Apparently guys from my grade were harassing her
Because of the way she dresses. This is where I found out she doesn’t choose to dress like that but it’s the only shit her parents buy for her. They won’t let her get a job either the whole story was super weird, it’s almost like they didn’t want her to grow up.

So I ended up inviting her to the mall that weekend, where I bought her an entirely new wardrobe, shoes, a backpack, clothes, socks, drawls. She was incredibly thankful and really appreciative. Monday comes around and she was still wearing her same stuff, so I end up asking her why because honestly I was just confused. Apparently her parents took the clothes because they were “too grown” and how she wasn’t mature enough to where said clothing. 

I ended up asking her if they’re was anyway I could talk to them because I spent 600 on everything. Like these were brand new clothes and there was absolutely nothing wrong with them. She agreed and that next day I had a conversation with her parents that didn’t go the best to say the least, they yelled at me for corrupting their autistic daughter. I had no idea she was autistic but what does her autism have to do with the clothes she wears? Like what, there really wasn’t more to this conversation it was really like talking to a brick wall. 

They did give me the clothes back, to where I kept them for her so she could change in school yk. 

I just wanna know if I’m the asshole for this, my mom is saying because of her disability, I should’ve contacted her parents before buying her new stuff. But I think the exact opposite, I don’t believe her disability should impact what she can and cannot wear. So I don’t know where I stand here so I came to reddit.

148,1eqvay6,AITA for telling my friend her son is developmentally delayed?,"I (27F) have been friends with Ari (36F) for about 10 years. Ari has a 3yo son, Jace, with her husband Jack (29M). I am pretty involved with Jace, I spend hours playing with him and babysit whenever needed.

When Jace was 2, I had a birthday dinner with my family. Ari and Jace attended. After Ari and Jace left my grandma and mom both made comments that Jace was quite behind for a 2 year old. I had no idea since I don’t know any other toddlers but after some googling saw that Jace should have been talking. Ari is a SAHM,  Jace has never been to Daycare and has never been around other toddlers. So, I wondered if Ari and Jack, like me, were completely oblivious to Jace falling behind. I tried to get Ari to discover this on her own, hoping a doctor or a parenting book would alert her. But she never ended up taking him to the doctors or reading the book.  

Cut to this month and Jace had his first playdate. Ari invited me to come hang out with her while they played. I noticed that his playmate, who's a few months younger than him, was much more advanced. The playdate made me start worrying about Jace again, he's not potty trained, his speech is still half unintelligible, his motor skills are delayed and he hasn't started developing any kind of social skills.

I wanted to say something about it but I held off for a bit because Ari had just gotten in a tiff with one of Jack's friends. The friend made comments to Jack and Ari about Jace rarely getting out of their apartment and Jace watching too much TV. In all fairness, Jace watches TV for 10 plus hours a day but I still think it was out of line for him to say anything, especially since he's not a parent himself.

Two days ago, Ari told me that she's decided to not put Jace in pre-school. She said that she wants to be home with him and that he's smart enough to just catch up when he starts kindergarten. At the moment I thought it was a good opening. I think I said something like, ""I've actually noticed that Jace is pretty behind where he's supposed to be developmentally."". She did not take that well at all and totally blew up at me, she accused me of calling Jace stupid and said I didn't get to have opinions on her parenting. I immediately regretted saying anything and tried to explain that I wasn't attacking her or Jace and just thought she needed to know that Jace isn't in the ""normal range"". I ended up going home pretty quick and haven't been back.

I talked with my boyfriend about it and he said that maybe the preschool wouldn't take Jace since he's not potty trained. If that's true, then maybe Ari did know Jace was behind and just didn't want to talk about it, so she lied. I hope that I can reconcile with Ari. I've spent the last year wanting to say something in order to get Jace help but maybe it was never my business to interfere with. AITA?

149,1eqv72l,AITA for sleeping on my partner’s side of the bed?,"For the past several days, I (25F) have only been getting 5 hours of sleep at best and 3 at worst. My BF (28M) knows that I’ve been tired but regardless I’ve been trying my best to hang out with him because I’ll be flying out soon.

Well last night, I thought we were going to bed (we were cleaning up the plates and dishes, stopped binging the show we were watching, etc). So I went and brushed my teeth, then relaxed in bed, note he hasn’t done any of that yet.

Since I was tired, I kind of just passed out in bed. From what I remember, I was on my side of the bed.

Then this morning, I got woken up earlier than usual because of his snoring. I was slightly annoyed because I have trouble sleeping in general so falling back asleep was a hassle. But I didn’t wake him up or anything, I just moved to the couch to try sleep there.

Well, my efforts failed and I stayed up for 6 hours more hours. At this point I just gave up and went back to the bedroom to lay down with my BF. I was clearly not happy but I told him it was cause I got woken up by him. I assured him that it wasn’t his fault or anything.

He started telling me that apparently he had woken me up last night as I was sleeping on his side of the bed. Which then I responded by complaining and grumbling. I rolled over to my side of the bed then he went to brush his teeth to join me in bed.

Then he had to turn the ceiling fan on, but accidentally turned on the lights too. That apparently also woke me and I grumbled at him. At that point he was upset, and then left the room for a while only to come back and see me on the middle of the bed.

At this point he is frustrated but didn’t want to wake me which would’ve made him even angrier and then just scooted into an available area on his side of the bed. He said he went into bed very annoyed with me, mostly about the fact I was sleeping on his side of the bed.

I responded saying that I don’t think it mattered that much which side of the bed he was sleeping on, he probably should’ve just left me sleep in his spot and then get into mine instead.

He then went on about how now I’m gonna complain and blame him for not getting good sleep. I told him I literally haven’t done that and wasn’t going to cause I don’t remember.

Then repeatedly he started saying that I’m doubling down on not being apologetic for sleeping on his side of the bed and then being upset about it. So I did, and he left the bedroom.

I’ve been just sitting on the bed for the last hour or two, and I know he is still angry. 

I’m not sure how to approach this topic to him now cause I feel like it wasn’t fair for him to get so upset at me for something I believe is minor, but maybe he’s valid?

152,1equsyw,WIBTAH if I don’t invite my sil to my wedding ,"I (24F) am getting married to my best friend and girlfriend(23F), we wanted to get married because we loved eachother and we planned on getting married since our second year of university. We have been together for 5 years, 9 years in friendship.

Now I don’t necessarily get along with my SIL, she has been rude to me since I was a teenager, my brother and her have been together since I was a kid, she didn’t like me and I didn’t like her either so we barely talked. She made me her maid of honour when I was 15 years old, which now I think was ridiculous as maid of honours usually pay and plan for everything and I was just a teen, after her wedding she barely talked to me or my family causing my older brother to distance himself from me despite us having a close relationship.

Now the problem for me is that since she found out about me getting married, she has been passive aggressive about two things, about my fiancé, because we are both women getting married she has told me it’s not traditional, and since I shut that down she has now been passive aggressive about being my maid of honour. She has been doing this over text since she still refuses to talk to me face to face.

I tried talking to my brother about her behaviour but he never listens or ignores my calls, I told my parents but they can’t get a hold of him either. My wedding is a few weeks away, and my fiancé still need to pick out a wedding dress and some flowers.

But I don’t know what to do, i want to tell my fiancé about it but she is already stressed enough and I don’t want to worry her, but I feel like I should un-invite my SIL, even if that causes my brother to not go either.

So Would I be the asshole if I uninvited my SIL??

EDIT: I wanted to say thank you to the commenters for taking the time to comment on my post, and I’m here to answer some questions.

We have been together for 5 years, 9 years in friendship.

Now I don’t necessarily get along with my SIL, she has been rude to me since I was a teenager, my brother and her have been together since I was a kid, she didn’t like me and I didn’t like her either so we barely talked. She made me her maid of honour when I was 15 years old, which now I think was ridiculous as maid of honours usually pay and plan for everything and I was just a teen, after her wedding she barely talked to me or my family causing my older brother to distance himself from me despite us having a close relationship.

Now the problem for me is that since she found out about me getting married, she has been passive aggressive about two things, about my fiancé, because we are both women getting married she has told me it’s not traditional, and since I shut that down she has now been passive aggressive about being my maid of honour. She has been doing this over text since she still refuses to talk to me face to face.

I tried talking to my brother about her behaviour but he never listens or ignores my calls, I told my parents but they can’t get a hold of him either. My wedding is a few weeks away, and my fiancé still need to pick out a wedding dress and some flowers.

But I don’t know what to do, i want to tell my fiancé about it but she is already stressed enough and I don’t want to worry her, but I feel like I should un-invite my SIL, even if that causes my brother to not go either.

So Would I be the asshole if I uninvited my SIL??

For a little bit of background. I (17F) am the youngest of my 2 siblings (23M and 22F). They are my half siblings, we all share a mother. My mother (42F) and father (49M) are married, and my siblings used to see their dads on weekends/breaks. This is just to say we were all raised together. The notable difference is the fact that their father, who lived over an hour away, seemed to have more time and effort for them. As opposed to my father who lived in the room across the hall from me. He's very old school, believes that as long as you bring home money you've done your part in raising your kids.  I've probably spent more quality time with my siblings father than my own.



I've always had the best relationship with my sister. She's the one you write your 'My Sister is my Hero' essays about. As soon as she got her first full time job, she started helping my mom to save up, so I could go to any college I wanted, without cost being a deciding factor. We have sister dates all the time. She's my emergency contact everywhere. She's my biggest cheerleader. She's designing a custom stole just for my graduation, which she thinks is a surprise. I just have to get it across, she's my moon and stars, means everything to me.



This is where the problem starts. A couple of months ago, my paternal cousin graduated. Her school is very small, so she was only given 2 tickets to give to friends/family. She gave one to her mother, the other one to her boyfriend who went to a different school. Her father didn't get to go. This has my dads family in an uproar, multiple people cutting contact with her. Despite my uncle being a deadbeat who hadn't spoken to her in almost a year before the incident.



My father was talking about it again with my mom, for whatever reason, and had said ""Well I know, no child of mine would ever leave me off the list, ain't that right 'OP'"". I responded ""Only thing I know, is that my mother and sister are going to be there, no matter how many tickets I have"". He asked me if that meant I would prioritize my sister over him, if I only had 2 tickets. I said ""Take it how you want to take it"".

  
Now he's walking around mad, keeps taking shots at me on his social media. He wanted to turn my phone off, only reason he didn't is because my mom said no. I've had a bunch of nasty text from my dad's family, whom I was quick to block. I think this is a bit much, I think, for just telling the truth. Now I think he's not getting a real ticket either regardless of the number. AITAH? ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-13,"AITA for Not Giving my Dad an Imaginary Ticket to my Graduation?

In the last game of the regular season, my friend Tom and I were both vying for second place and the first round bye. We were talking shit as you do, when I realized that our opponents were both going to miss the playoffs and hadn't subbed their guys.

We're all friends in the league, so I reached out to the opponent of Tom and told him to sub his guys, which he did. I didn't reach out to my opponent, and he didn't end up subbing his guys. Sure enough, Tom lost and I won, and I got second place and the first round bye.

I shouldn't have said anything, but I told Tom of my treachery as a joke. He kind of lost it, and proceeded to complain how it wasn't fair and how I as the LM had a responsibility for integrity or something. I just checked and he said I was ""colluding"". I told him I just reminded someone to sub their guys and it wasn't a big deal.

157,1equptz,AITA basically telling my moms husband to get a life,"Sorry for a long post in advance and im sorry about my writing, never was good at that. I 23f and my moms husband 44m (we will call him john) have never had the best relationship. He has come into my life at a preteen age and we have always been civil with each other but have butt heads from time to time. It has been like that for 12 years and counting, which hasnt always been easy for my mom. She only wants us to have a good relationship with eachother and only sees the best in us like a good mom that we don't see. She really is the glue between us.

Heres come the issue that lays on the table. For the past 2 years, I have been blocked by this man. I know that sounds wild so heres some back story. 2 years ago my mom was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and i wanted to give her my full attention. I called everyday, helped her with money, took her to her chemo appointments and even started working 3 12s at my job just so i could make sure she was alright. My main focus was on my mom and helping her get better. This is where the problem started. Due to me giving my mom my full attention, i havent really checked up on John and didn't come over to hang out with him while my mom was staying overnight at the hospital.

I think thats where i messed up. I got a very lengthy text message from John stating that i was ungratefull and didn't care about him at all. I couldn't respond to him at all due to me being blocked. So ever sense, I tried talking to him when i was at my moms house, got him what he wanted for birthdays and xmas and all i got back was a nod. I have been doing this for 2 years and was getting fed up. At the beginning of this year, I have decided that i don't want to keep this up with someone that doesn't care about me at all. He hasn't put any effort in it at all and until he does, im not doing it anymore.

Last week was his birthday and to be completely honest, i truely forgot. I have been super busy with work and didn't even think about it until he messaged me today from my mom’s phone to bring something back to him. The text stated 'john wants his stuff back and wat do i tell him about his bday?'. I know that wasn't my mom sense she has always called him dad to me. Confused, I tell him when do you want it back and i forgot about his bday.

Not even 30 mins later, I dropped it off and plainly told him im sorry about forgetting ur bday but even if i didn't, how would i get ahold of u? He told me to call on my moms phone to wish him a happy bday or to stop by. I basically told him my mom doesn't need to be the middle man in all of this and if u actually want me to talk to u then you need to unblock me from ur phone. Also i work full time so i can't just stop by at any given point. He huffed, blew me off and walked away.

158,1equlbw,AITA for not picking up my inebriated roommate?,"So, my roommate and I, both naval officers currently (23M) in school, were gearing up for a big event on Friday. My girlfriend needed to be at the schoolhouse by 3:00 PM, but I had to be there earlier, at noon. Since my girlfriend and I share one car, I brought her along, knowing she had some errands to run while I was in class.

When we arrived, I discovered a nail in my tire—great timing, right? I asked my roommate if he’d be okay with letting my girlfriend borrow his car for a couple of hours so she could get her errands done. Without hesitation, he agreed. Problem solved, or so I thought.

Later that evening, our class went out to celebrate around 8:30. My girlfriend and I drove our now-fixed car to the event, and my roommate drove his. At some point during the night, my roommate asked if we’d want to split an Uber with him to get home. We planned on leaving around 10:00 PM, so we asked if he wanted to come with us then. He declined, saying the night was just getting started for him, but he did ask if I could pick him up later because Ubers were ridiculously expensive—about $70.

Here’s where things got sticky. I was tired and knew  I wouldn’t want to be driving around later, so I told him I wouldn’t be able to pick him up. The look he gave me was like I’d just blindsided —he just said, “Umm, okayy,” but I could tell he was upset.

He did end up getting an uber at 12 AM

In my mind, if he was choosing to stay out, it was his responsibility to find his way back, but clearly, he didn’t see it the same way. He’s been distant since, and I can’t shake the feeling that I might’ve been the jerk in this situation.

She went on the kayak down sthe stream and i fished off shore and watched our not very well trained dogs (one is trained shes just not good on recalls yet). After a bit of fishing i saw anothe car (2016 VW Tiguan) behind ours (2010 GMC Terrain) and i went over to see why they where there. So i went over and the people who owned the Tiguan asked me if this car (terrain) was mine and i said yes, they also asked me how long we would be here and if we were camping here and i said ""no we aren't camping here and idk how long we will be here since my mother is out on the kayak and i might go after her"" and they (they where both girls probably like 18 or something since they drove a medium sized suv (it was smaller then our terrain) down a pretty bad dirt road) asked me nicely if i could move our car (terrain) so they could set up their campsite before it got dark, i was skeptical at first since im not at the legal driving age in my country (LDA is 16 here and im 14) and i said yes because im a nice person and i play lots of driving simulators and ive moved a car before and it was a pretty big area and the terrain has a backup camera. i carefully backed the terrain up while checking the mirrors, the backup camera (to make sure our dogs where out of they way) and also slowly working the gas and brake pedal to make sure i wasn't going too fast. I did really good i wasn't even close to anything that could damage the car and i left lots of room so they could get by in their Tiguan. After that i went back to fishing while i waited for my mother to get back since i just wanted to leave since the dogs weren't listening.

Fast forward to when my mother gets back
I told her i moved the terrain so the people could set up their campsite since i knew we weren't camping there and she starts yelling at me (like always)
Her: you had no right to move the car without my permission and what would you have done if the key wasn't there 
Me: we don't even have the proper gear to camp and we don't even have food and I don't want to camp with you right now 
Her: I have all the gear to camp and we have plenty of food in the terrain 
Me: yeah old food thats probably been sitting in there for months 
Her: still you had no right to give them the space 
I just ignored her and stated packing up my stuff then when we finally got in the car she yelled at me again louder this time since we where in the car
Her: YOU HAD NO RIGHT GIVING THESE PEOPLE OUR SPACE WHAT IF WE WERE GONNA CAMP HERE (i then put on my headphones and turn up my music to ignore her)  ETC ETC 

so am i the asshole?

TL:DR i moved my mothers car safely a few feet backwards as an underage driver so these two people could set up their campsite since we weren't camping there and my mother got pissed at me for moving it",Asshole,2024-08-13,"AITA for safely moving my mothers car so people could use the campsite we where parked at Sorry for bad punctuation im still working on it

161,1equ3tf,AITA for telling my girlfriend to stop using her phone while seeing me off?,"Me (19M) and my gf (19F) have been together for a couple of months now. This post is about something that happened a couple of hours ago but that still bugs me as I don't know if I was in the wrong or not.

For context I was supposed to spend the night at her place but a couple of hours before the incident she told me I couldn't stay for the night anymore. That kinda upset me but whatever, we'll meet again tomorrow so all was good. We got to spend some time at her place before I had to leave and we had a great time. Once I was about to leave she wanted to see me off.

I was with my car and the door for their driveway was closed so she had to call her BIL to open it. I should also mention that while we were together before she didn't use her phone as it was charging. After she called her BIL she started looking at her phone without saying anything to me.
This didn't upset me that much but I found it rude as I think that when you are seeing someone off you should focus on them until they leave and after that you are free to do whatever so I asked her if she could put her phone down so we get a chance to say goodbye before I have to go. This pissed her off more then I expected and she started saying things like she is allowed to use her phone whenever she wants and that she didn't get a chance to use it while we were together. Now I obviously agree with that, I would never prohibit her from using her phone but that doesn't mean I didn't find it plain rude for her to make me wait there for the door to open so I can leave while she was just using her phone in front of me.

I told her she could have just used it 2 minutes later after I left but then she told me she had a couple missed calls from one of her friends. I didn't know that so I told her I wouldn't have had a problem if she just said something along the lines of: ""Her my friend called me while my phone was charging, do you mind if I talk with her to see what's up?"". That would have been totally fine by me but as she said nothing, I just assumed she was just reading random texts or looking at reels some friends sent her, things that in my opinion could have waited until I left.

After that she put her phone away but she was obviously upset and annoyed at me telling her to put her phone down (even tho I didn't know why she was using it at the time). Soon after the gate was opened and we said our goodbyes and I left.
Now I'm home feeling bad about the whole thing. We did text each other saying we are sorry for what happened and we will discuss it further tomorrow and to be honest, if I knew my original comment would have landed us into this situation, I would have never made it. I just found it rude in the moment because personally I would never do something like that.

Now I ask you, AITA for telling her to put her phone down while she was seeing me off or was I right in the fact that what she did was kinda rude?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-13,"AITA for telling my girlfriend to stop using her phone while seeing me off?

162,1eqtrca,AITA that my mom got me a shirt that I wouldn’t wear? ,"It removed my last post. Anyways:

-Parents are in Samoa/ Fiji
-They bring us gifts from all the countries they’ve visited and rub in our face about how good the country was
-They get my siblings everything the want but not me, which I’m glad so I can make my own money
-I’m Male 18yrs 
-Mom asks me on FaceTime what shirt I want. I tell her because it will match my closet and also is professional enough I could wear it to my sales job. I also remind her over text as well, no way she could’ve missed it. 
-She tells me she’s getting me a completely different shirt. 
-I tell her wanted the black one because of my job. -She wanted to get me a bright pink one, very nonprofessional and doesn’t match my wardrobe at all. She gets me the pink one. 
-I tell her I can’t wear it. Because I can’t. I have to look professional. She said I’m always ungrateful and have a “stick up my butt”
-I am the most grateful of the kids. I’m the second oldest of 4. They get everything. They complain. I get socks, I’m happy. They forgot 2 out of my 3 most recent birthdays. My mom was missing for the 3rd birthday. So my last 3 birthdays have been…. interesting. They tell me to suck it up. I do because I’m a man. 
-They’ve kicked me out because I was watching a puppy for a few days… lol 
-When I went to the mental hospital they were more upset that I crashed their car vs the reason I crashed it. (Intentionally) 

So. Tell me. AITA? I have receipts to prove my mom was all mad at me. Then she told me the shirt would instead be going to my cousin (who was invited to the Samoa/Fiji trip.
