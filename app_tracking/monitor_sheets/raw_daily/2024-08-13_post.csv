0,1ere2g6,AITA For not lying about/covering up my pregnancy experience to appease my sisters conservative boyfriend?,"Hi all.

Background info; I am a trans man and currently twenty nine. Post op, full beard, male pattern baldness... The works. Have not been sexed as female, disregarding medical situations, since I was a teen. 

I had my son when I was twenty six. Accidental pregnancy and the like but we couldn't face a termination so now he's here. Anyway, my husband and I are proud parents. Kiddo will be three in a few months. We are currently in the process of trying for a second.

My younger sister is twenty three and currently dating a guy she met at college. He is conservative and as such my sister worked very carefully to make sure he did not know about my transition.

A few weeks ago she finally introduced him to us. He's a pretty nice guy and was great with my son. He assumed he was adopted, made a comment about how much he looks like the both of us, asked if we had any photos of his birth parents for comparison. 

I corrected him - just told him that he's not adopted, we are the bio parents, etc. He was confused but didn't ask for any further explanation from us. He did quiz my sister who tried to cover it up by telling him that our son doesn't know he's adopted and we're trying to avoid him becoming curious.

He, the boyfriend, was then pretty upset and decided to confront me about it. Very stereotypical ""this is why people don't want the gays adopting"" type rant. Mostly fuelled by his own distaste for his (adoptive) parents, we weren't too upset or anything. But I was annoyed with my sister.

I was, originally, going to keep my transition quiet from him as she'd asked just to keep the peace. However, because she decided to paint us as some crazed adoptive gays, I told him the truth - in a relatively crude way, but, honestly, a lot of people need it that way to understand. 

Paraphrasing, but it was something along the lines of, ""Sorry, [sister] lied. He's not adopted. I used to be a chick, have a vagina, gave birth. Bitch at her, not us."" 

He was kind of confused at first and ended up leaving. Their relationship is now a lot rockier. I don't know if it's because of her lying or him finding out about my transition or not. She's claiming the latter.

My sister is extremely upset with me - I agreed to not tell him and did anyway. I told her that I agreed to not tell him, yes, but I didn't agree to let him think our kid is adopted when he isn't (and especially not allow him to think that we're some crazy gays trying to convince our son two cocks can make a baby).

Parents are siding with her, saying we knew he would react badly and we want to destroy her relationship (her ex left her when he found out I was trans for some reason).

I really don't think I overstepped too much, but on the othe hand, I fully understand why she's upset.

I was talking to my husband about it and he was like, this would be funny on AITA, so here we are.

1,1erad9c,UPDATE: AITA for telling my vet tech roommate she's a bad pet owner,"To everyone who posted judgements I appreciate your feedback and have considered everything while moving forward in our conflict. I do recall a couple people wanting an update so here it is. It's really not exciting though.

My roommate and I are not speaking, between the issues with her cat and a few other household related issues that have transpired since posting she and I are simply cohabitating and only speaking when absolutely necessary. I have found a new apartment which I will be moving into in 6 weeks and while my rent will go up, so will my peace of mind and capacity for relaxation. I wish I knew what was going to happen to the roommates cat, but I don't know, and I admittedly worry about it. He's a good cat, and I hope whatever happens after I leave, that he has a good long life.

My mental health, and the wellness of my cat who is prone to stress related illness and has a few chronic health issues of his own, means this decision to move out and leave this mess behind is the best thing I can do for the fur baby and I.

Roommate has since (prior to going full silent treatment) admitted to not being able to afford her cats vet care and that contributed to his delayed care. I have mixed feelings about that because I understand how unaffordable vet care can be, but I can't understand why someone would save nothing for vet bills if they were going to adopt a high needs animal with several medical issues. I told her this, I'm certain it's part of why she won't speak to me. We pay well below market rate for our rental, so we both have significant expendable income right now, but she cannot afford vet care and that to me seems careless. However, this is an issue I'm accepting will never be understood or resolved, not at least while I'm around.

As for my kitty, he's having a dental issues, which I knew was coming as the vet warned me during his dental extractions 4 years ago it would like eventually resurface. He has a checkup tomorrow, and hopefully he doesn't need more extractions, but if he does we'll get him what he needs and book him in, though I am hoping it doesn't require that level of treatment, as I don't want to put him through that recovery again.

I wish I had more exciting news, there's really nothing special to report. Her and I aren't on speaking terms, she's spending even more time out of the house to avoid me, her cat is fine (for now), my cat is not fine (for now), and overall I am doing good knowing in six weeks me and my furball are free of her forever. I will be losing her contact information and never speaking to her again as soon as myself, my belongings and my cat are out of this apartment.

There won't be any further updates or information because as far as I am concerned this chapter is closed. I'm just coasting through until I get the keys to my new place.

Thank you for your support, feedback and kind words... I hope all of you have a lovely week!",UPDATE,2024-08-13,"UPDATE: AITA for telling my vet tech roommate she's a bad pet owner To everyone who posted judgements I appreciate your feedback and have considered everything while moving forward in our conflict.
