0,1es7pdg,AITA for not going to my mom’s wedding?,"Hi, just to get it out first, I will mention I’m trans (this is important), so my mom recently invited me to her wedding which is taking place in a month, I really want to go and support her because it’s her big day, but I know if I go my other family members would probably give me and my partner dirty looks the entire time, I would feel really uncomfortable, my mom loves and supports me for who I am and she told me to not worry about the other family members and that it’s her day but, I know she will be busy and I’ll end up not talking to anyone except my partner and mom and her fiancée, also it’s a 6 hour drive to the venue, I don’t want to drive 6 hours to feel uncomfortable but I feel like I should just tough it out and just go, I really don’t want to though, I have no idea how my family members would react to me and what I decide to wear, I know most of them if not all are going to be transphobic and probably racist towards my partner.",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-08-14,"AITA for not going to my mom’s wedding?

1,1es6if2,AITA for being uncomfortable around my sisters boyfriend?,"Hello, so I had an experience and simply wanted some outside input on the situation. My sister recently got into a relationship a few months ago and I met him a few times before all this, a few people in my family and even her herself had warned me that he was a little southern rednecky sort of type but he was very nice when I had met him, he did say a few slurs which I was not okay with but didn’t say anything since I didn’t feel it was the time or place to “call him out” for it.

But this time that they came over to visit, he was talking and recounting a joke he’d heard which I won’t retell since it is specific to our situation and I don’t want anyone guessing(that I know) but it was a joke about trans people, not a terrible one, but when he went to say trans people he said. 
“Transvestites, or transgenders”
And this made me very uncomfortable, the term transvestites specifically. One reason it made me so uncomfortable is because I myself am trans and truly do not surround myself around people that would joke or say things like that. 

So basically after that happened I didn’t really want to talk to him much or spend much time around him so I went back to my apartment early and talked to my dad about it over the phone and he agreed that it was odd and that him saying the other slurs had also put him off, but my mother on the other hand loves my sisters boyfriend and that she doesn’t have too “watch what she says” around him. 

This obviously made me even more so uncomfortable which just pissed everyone off. So the question is am I the asshole or am I overreacting about all this? I know he wasn’t being malicious and I don’t think he’s a bad person, the usage of the terms so casually just made me very uncomfortable. Any comments would be helpful, I just want some perspective, thank you.",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-08-14,"AITA for being uncomfortable around my sisters boyfriend?

2,1es3dta,AITA for exposing sister as a bigot?,"My (F51) sister (F56) confessed to me that she voted Reform in the last general election. As a family, we are mostly Lib Dem or Green voters (parent was an LD Councillor for years). Sister has becoming increasingly right wing, following people like Tommy Robinson and Nigel Farage on Twitter. She has also said to me, “Islam is a hateful religion” (although she denies it). She is anti trans and is adamant that you “cannot change your sex” and that gender does not exist. She was attacked at 16 which wasn’t dealt with at all well by the family and left her traumatised. Sister also has chronic illness so is at home on her own going down internet rabbit holes, led to some dark places by algorithms. 

Here’s where I may be the AH. 

I said I thought she had voted Reform at the election and she smirked at me. I was pretty shocked and disappointed, but kind of left it at that - I said I didn’t want to talk about politics with her anymore.  I don’t recall her saying “don’t tell anyone”, but maybe I should have realised that voting is a confidential matter. 

Fast forward a few weeks and I was talking to my Spanish sister-in-law about current events and mentioned that Sister had voted Reform. SIL was a bit shocked but not that surprised. However, the more SIL has thought about it, the more offended she became that Sister had voted for an anti immigrant party, not just for herself as an immigrant, but also for the kids (9&11) who have dual nationality.  So now my Brother and Other Sister know and have been vocal in their disapproval. This has culminated in Brother and SIL not wanting Reform Sister to have anything to do with the kids and to give them all space. 

Reform Sister has exploded at me, saying I betrayed her trust and that she will never forgive me. She has unfriended me on Social Media and is not answering any texts. I have tried to let her know that I will not cut her off from my (possibly trans) child and that my door is open. 

Am I the AH for breaking Sister’s confidence (that I didn’t know was a secret), ruining her relationships with Brother, SIL and kids and throwing a grenade into the middle of a previously close family?
