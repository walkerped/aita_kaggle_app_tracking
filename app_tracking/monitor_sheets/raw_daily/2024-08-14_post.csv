1,1es6if2,AITA for being uncomfortable around my sisters boyfriend?,"Hello, so I had an experience and simply wanted some outside input on the situation. My sister recently got into a relationship a few months ago and I met him a few times before all this, a few people in my family and even her herself had warned me that he was a little southern rednecky sort of type but he was very nice when I had met him, he did say a few slurs which I was not okay with but didn’t say anything since I didn’t feel it was the time or place to “call him out” for it.

But this time that they came over to visit, he was talking and recounting a joke he’d heard which I won’t retell since it is specific to our situation and I don’t want anyone guessing(that I know) but it was a joke about trans people, not a terrible one, but when he went to say trans people he said. 
“Transvestites, or transgenders”
And this made me very uncomfortable, the term transvestites specifically. One reason it made me so uncomfortable is because I myself am trans and truly do not surround myself around people that would joke or say things like that. 

So basically after that happened I didn’t really want to talk to him much or spend much time around him so I went back to my apartment early and talked to my dad about it over the phone and he agreed that it was odd and that him saying the other slurs had also put him off, but my mother on the other hand loves my sisters boyfriend and that she doesn’t have too “watch what she says” around him. 

This obviously made me even more so uncomfortable which just pissed everyone off. So the question is am I the asshole or am I overreacting about all this? I know he wasn’t being malicious and I don’t think he’s a bad person, the usage of the terms so casually just made me very uncomfortable.

2,1es3dta,AITA for exposing sister as a bigot?,"My (F51) sister (F56) confessed to me that she voted Reform in the last general election. As a family, we are mostly Lib Dem or Green voters (parent was an LD Councillor for years). Sister has becoming increasingly right wing, following people like Tommy Robinson and Nigel Farage on Twitter. She has also said to me, “Islam is a hateful religion” (although she denies it). She is anti trans and is adamant that you “cannot change your sex” and that gender does not exist. She was attacked at 16 which wasn’t dealt with at all well by the family and left her traumatised. Sister also has chronic illness so is at home on her own going down internet rabbit holes, led to some dark places by algorithms. 

Here’s where I may be the AH. 

I said I thought she had voted Reform at the election and she smirked at me. I was pretty shocked and disappointed, but kind of left it at that - I said I didn’t want to talk about politics with her anymore.  I don’t recall her saying “don’t tell anyone”, but maybe I should have realised that voting is a confidential matter. 

Fast forward a few weeks and I was talking to my Spanish sister-in-law about current events and mentioned that Sister had voted Reform. SIL was a bit shocked but not that surprised. However, the more SIL has thought about it, the more offended she became that Sister had voted for an anti immigrant party, not just for herself as an immigrant, but also for the kids (9&11) who have dual nationality.  So now my Brother and Other Sister know and have been vocal in their disapproval. This has culminated in Brother and SIL not wanting Reform Sister to have anything to do with the kids and to give them all space. 

Reform Sister has exploded at me, saying I betrayed her trust and that she will never forgive me. She has unfriended me on Social Media and is not answering any texts. I have tried to let her know that I will not cut her off from my (possibly trans) child and that my door is open. 

Am I the AH for breaking Sister’s confidence (that I didn’t know was a secret), ruining her relationships with Brother, SIL and kids and throwing a grenade into the middle of a previously close family?

After 50 minutes I messaged him saying I was waiting but had not heard from him. A couple minutes later he replied saying he won't be long to which I replied if he wanted to play games that was fine and I would have some time to myself but he replied that he wanted to call and it wouldn't be long. 

I jokingly called him a ""meany"" and reminded him he had told me a ""few minutes"". He eventually called me 1hr45m after the original call. He hadn't apologised to me over text so I said to him over the phone that I would appreciate an apology for not messaging to tell me he would be longer. He said sorry and moved on but seemed annoyed at me for raising this.

He said that I hadn't given him time to apologise, calling me impatient, and that he was going to apologise on the phone after easing into the conversation. (I had asked for an apology pretty much as soon as he conversation on the phone started)

He also said that because I had asked for an apology this made it difficult for him to give me a genuine apology and made him not want to apologise.

He said he understood why I was annoyed but didn't feel it warranted a long discussion. 

The issue for me is that this is a reoccurring issue which I have raised many times before where I feel he does not respect my time.

I told him it was unfair to call me impatient because I had waited for 1hr45m and not got angry with him but instead expressed that I would like an apology. I said most people would be angry in this situation.

4,1esf46l,AITA for only getting one of my sons a pet?,"I am a single father with 3 sons: Felix (20), Marcus (13), and Adam (11). They each have different mothers.

I also have a several pets: 2 dogs, a cat, a bearded dragon, and an aquarium with fish and shrimp. 

2 weeks ago, for Adam's 11th birthday I got him a leopard gecko. I was struggling with deciding what to get him for a birthday present and my friend, who works at a reptile store, mentioned they had had a leopard gecko surrendered to them a few days previously.

Adam had been begging me for a while for us to get a new pet and I had been open to the idea and we had already discussed what he and his brothers might like. I knew the gecko would go over well as he had been specifically adamant on a reptile.

He was happy with his gift. I ended up getting the gecko for $30 and I already owned most of what I needed for the enclosure, so I only spent about $50. 

However, the gift has since caused issues. Although he said nothing to me, Marcus was apparently less than impressed with Adam getting gifted a pet. I think specifically because I've never bought him a pet of his own and he's older.

Marcus's mom called me upset and arguing with me about the gift. She argued I can't get Adam his own pet if I never did the same for Felix or Marcus, and that it's another example of favoritism. I'm obviously hurting for my son if he's upset about this (it's still unclear if he is or it's his mom with the problem), but I don't agree with her reasoning.

Adam lives with me for around 60% of the year. His mom lives very close to me, and we used to split custody evenly, but these days Adam choses to spend more time with me. 

However, Marcus lives in a different city just under 3 hours from where I live. He goes to school in his mom's city, and I therefor only have him every other weekend and half of school breaks. Having a pet at my home doesn't make as much sense as if he's barely here it wouldn't really be his pet. 

On top of this, I'm expecting Adam to do the majority of care for the gecko, this wouldn't be feasible for Marcus who wouldn't be here most the time. Marcus has also shown way less interest in animals (and specifically reptiles) compared to Adam so I never really considered that getting him his own pet would be a great gift.

Marcus's mom always argues I show Adam favoritism just because he lives with me more. This is frustrating specifically as it was her who moved cities and is the reason, we can't do split custody. Marcus got a lot for his birthday: a video game, sneakers, Lego, and I took him to a baseball game.

5,1esetcj,AITA for failing to procure a custom made celebratory ring for our newborn on time,"My wife had made it clear even before getting pregnant that she would like to have a ring to celebrate the birth of our first kid. Don't think it matters but the design for the ring is very meaningful to us because its design is linked to our lore/history as a couple and weaves the concept of now having a child too into the design too. She dropped explicit hints on the design and it was clear that I would have a specific jeweller make it. I was and still am actually very excited about the ring.

I sent the specifics for the ring to the jewler about 2.5 months before the baby due date thinking that would be enough time, but I was wrong. I had to follow up multiple times by email and phone to move things along, and coupled with the fact that the jeweller is in another country and also closes a long time for the holidays, the baby has been born a month ago and the ring will be in our hands only in September.

  
Wife is really disappointed and gave me a hard time about it today, saying I don't care enough about her. (she waited about 1 month to give it to me explicitly but I could tell it was brewing....)

I could have been more insistent with the jeweller but that is not my style. I probably didn't give the symbolism of having the ring right around the birth enough weight, waiting for months after the event does detract from it I guess.

9,1esdw0m,AITA for telling my siblings I don’t want to split the bill equally since they have kids and I don’t?,"I have two older sisters (both over 30 years old), while I’m still in my 20s. The thing is, they suggested to invite my mom to lunch for Mother’s Day and they were talking about splitting the expenses in 3 parts. Both of them have 2 kids each while I don’t. Given past (bad) experiences where the kids were not contemplated in the bill but still would eat I told them I did not like the idea of splitting in 3 since their kids should be taken into account, mind you, the kids are not babies, one of them will soon turn 18. At the mention of that they did not like it and called me confrontational and my mom even found out and took their side, as per usual.  

To give you some more context as to why it bothers me: A similar experience happened before during a trip where I had to pay a third out of all the expenses, my mom another and my sister another (husband and kids included). She thought my mom and I were oblivious about the whole thing but my mom begged me to not say anything to not start a fight but now I think I’ve held my silence for long.

So, the question is, AITA for wanting the bill to be split differently considering I don’t have kids and I’m only paying for my share and my mom’s? ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-14,"AITA for telling my siblings I don’t want to split the bill equally since they have kids and I don’t? I have two older sisters (both over 30 years old), while I’m still in my 20s. The thing is, they suggested to invite my mom to lunch for Mother’s Day and they were talking about splitting the expenses in 3 parts. Both of them have 2 kids each while I don’t. Given past (bad) experiences where the kids were not contemplated in the bill but still would eat I told them I did not like the idea of splitting in 3 since their kids should be taken into account, mind you, the kids are not babies, one of them will soon turn 18. At the mention of that they did not like it and called me confrontational and my mom even found out and took their side, as per usual.  

To give you some more context as to why it bothers me: A similar experience happened before during a trip where I had to pay a third out of all the expenses, my mom another and my sister another (husband and kids included). She thought my mom and I were oblivious about the whole thing but my mom begged me to not say anything to not start a fight but now I think I’ve held my silence for long.

10,1esdhxo,AITA for not letting my boyfriend stay in my house for 2 months for his brother to stay in his bedroom?,"I am a 22-year-old woman, and my boyfriend is 21. We haven't finished our bachelor's degrees yet, and the only income I have is from my internship. 

I live alone in a one-bedroom apartment that belongs to my father because it’s closer to college than my parents’ house. I pay for my food, transportation, electricity, college fees, and other expenses, while my dad pays for the condominium fees and water in his apartment. 

My boyfriend lives with his mother in a two-bedroom apartment. One room is for him, and the other is for her. He has a 27-year-old brother who lives in another country and earns a salary higher than both of their parents' combined income. Every time his brother comes to visit, he and the family force my boyfriend to give up his room so that the brother can stay there during his visit (which lasts around two months, and he visits twice a year). Additionally, my boyfriend's family expects me to host him in my apartment during this period. 

In the past, when my boyfriend stayed at my place for months after having several fights with his family (for reasons such as previously having to share the room with the said brother, where my boyfriend would sleep on the floor while his brother slept in the loft bed), it wasn’t good for him because he didn’t have a space to call his own. It wasn’t good for me because I felt burdened with the responsibility for my boyfriend, and it strained my relationship with my parents, as they didn’t agree with him living with me. 

Additionally, it’s important to note that besides my boyfriend being treated worse than his brother, my family and I have always been treated worse than his brother's girlfriends. We've been together for over three years, and his family has never met my family, never invited us for a meal, or visited my parents’ house, whereas they have hosted his brother's girlfriend’s family several times. They have NEVER spoken to my dad. 

Anyway, this time, when his brother came, my boyfriend’s family decided on our behalf that he would stay with me while his brother stayed in his room, without even considering my opinion, because they believe it’s my duty to do so. I said no, and now his family is upset with me. 

Things to consider on my side: his brother has the money to rent a place. His brother is much older. His brother is not dependent on their parents. That is no longer his brother's house. 
Things to consider on his brother side: he is goig to do a knee surgery then will have to rest for a week. My boyfriend said it is ok for him to stay in his bedroom doing this period, but two months is a little too much.

To sum up, their mother said that she prefers the older brother, and that the older brother will stay in the room because she’s the one who makes the rules in the house. And she also said that what I'm doing is wrong because I stayed in my boyfriend's grandmother house for 2 weeks when there a was a huge storm and flood in my state, and a lot of people died. 

Some additional facts that aren’t directly related to the main issue but provide more perspective: his mother and father are separated. His mother lives in her own apartment, and his father lives with his grandparents because he doesn't have enough money to live somewhere better. Even though my boyfriend lives with his mother, she hardly pays for anything, and she has never contributed much when it comes to their children, despite being employed. His father, because he still lives with his mother, pays for the household bills like internet, subscriptions, food, college expenses, gas, light etc., which his mother also benefits from.

I just sat there for about 20 minutes while they ridulced me, saying i looked old, dead, ugly, and how they expected me to look better and how “it’s not looking good for you” stuff. It was like mental torture, the more i looked at myself in the camera too, the worse and worse i felt about myself.

And they keep telling me that they’re trying to help me to go from “little me” to “big me”

i’m short and ugly and mid. I hate the way I look and they’ve made me so insecure. They get a bunch of girls and shame me for not being able to get any girls come up to me first.

When i told them to stop they laughed and said “i didn’t think u were actually being serious” in a condescending way. 

I’m so tired man. I want to stop talking to them but I also don’t want to give up/let them hurt me. But it’s hard. 

Am i just being the asshole for being too sensitive about it or are they the asshole?

13,1esclgz,AITA if I got kinda pissed at my student?,"I am a teacher in a company that sells courses for the local equivalent of the SAT, this summer I am teaching a bunch of high schoolers.

I am available to my students so they can send me WhatsApp messages.

My availability schedule used to be 9 am to 9 pm Monday to Saturday, but I changed my schedule to 9 am - 8 pm Monday to Friday.

I made a big deal about it in class, wrote it as large as possible on the blackboard sent a message to the WhatsApp group, and pinned it. and I asked them not to disturb me after hours.

Because it is my personal phone, I don't want to silence my phone in case something important happens, and I don't want to silence the students so I can answer quickly during the day.

Today was the last date to hand in an assignment.

The assignment was completing a mock exam of 2 hours, they had a week to complete the task and were encouraged to let me know if something came up.

A student forgot to hand in the assignments and decided to let me know **after** my availability schedule, giving excuses that they didn't have the time to hand it in despite already doing the mock exam a day earlier. (it takes a couple of minutes to hand it in and you can do it on the phone, if they knew they wouldn't have the time they could have and should have let me know in advance.)

I called them, and told them, ""I said in class and in the group chat that I am not available after 8 pm, please do not contact me at this time again. you can approach me tomorrow and I will reopen the submission box for the duration of the break.

14,1esc3ax,AITA for being angry about my husband not listening to my professional advice twice,"I'm a doctor, and recently my husband had two accidents. First, he burned his hand with hot water, and then he cut his hand while doing some work around the house. Both times, he asked for my advice on how to treat the injuries, and both times, he ignored my suggestions.

I work in emergency medicine and deal with wounds frequently. My advice was simple and inexpensive (he doesn’t like to spend)—just disinfect the area and cover it with a sterile dressing. The cut would have benefitted from stitches, but now he’ll probably have a scar because the skin didn’t adhere properly. I even offered to take him to my facility for the stitches, but he refused, saying he preferred to spend his evening differently. Instead, he just washed the wound with water and used a small bandage.

Now, I’m frustrated that he ignored my advice, and he’s angry with me for being upset. He says I’m being unnecessarily harsh and that I don’t have the right to tell him what to do. He thanked me for my care but believes he handled the situation fine, even though the second wound just happened yesterday, so we don’t really know the outcome yet. I tried to explain that proper care could prevent infection and scarring, but that didn’t change his opinion. He also pointed out that I don’t always follow his professional advice (we share some work in a field unrelated to medicine), which is true, but I feel this situation was more straightforward with less room for debate. His advice to me often involves online business, which is more variable.

My main frustration stems from feeling like my time and words are wasted, and that he doesn’t respect my expertise. I even consulted a surgery colleague about his wound, was late to my exercise class to respond to his texts, and offered to take him to my workplace for sutures, even though it would take a lot of time out of my already tight schedule. He didn’t ask for this extra effort, so I’m partly angry at myself for caring so much when he clearly doesn’t.

I understand his reasoning to some extent, but I’m upset about how he’s handling this. To me, his communication feels arrogant, though that might be just my perception. I expected him to come home today and try to make amends, but instead, he’s angry that I’m angry.

15,1esbwux,WIBTA if I choose to go overseas for my master's against my father's hopes instead of doing it in my country?,"Sorry, this is going to be super long so please bear with me.

I (24M) have completed my bachelors in computer engineering in 2022 from a mid level university. Since COVID hit, I started helping out my father and my uncle at our family business which is totally unrelated to the field I graduated in. After completing my bachelors, I realised I won't be able to work in the IT sector. That kind of cemented my decision to help out at my family business during COVID.

Now, because I've taken on several important tasks and responsibilities, it gives my father and uncle the much needed freedom and time to actually work on expanding our business. Since the start of this year, the parts of the business that I manage (Sales and services) have slowly started declining due to various factors (unstable markets, unethical practices by competitors, some issues on my part etc). Noticing this, my father and I had a deep conversation roughly a month ago where he suggested that I try and get a master's in a financial course as a backup in case of any unexpected situations in the future. He suggested a financial course because I have been managing our finances along with my part of the business since I started working.

I started researching different courses which I could take with my bachelors in IT. I spent two weeks compiling everything, researched on courses which I can do in my home country and overseas both. For relevance, I want to go to either Germany or Ireland if I do decide on going overseas. 

Now onto the problem, after our conversation and my reasearch, I told my dad everything I described in the above points. At first, he told me he'd support me in whatever choice I make but he'd prefer that I stay here and help them with the business remotely while I study. He said I could also help them expand our business to the city I'd go to for my masters. I discussed this with my best friend.

My best friend told me that while he thinks that I should stay here rather than go to a foreign country just because of my almost decade long dream and hopes of a better life there, I should make the choice where I won't face many problems.

I've been torn in my mind between these two choices. On one hand, I feel that this is the closest I've come to making my decade long dream into a reality but at the same time, it pains me because in order to realise that dream, I'll make my dad (47M) take on more responsibility for the 2 or more years I'll be gone if I go. Things came to a head 2 hours ago when I voiced this to my mom and dad. My dad admitted that while he told me to try for my master's, he thinks now that it was a mistake and if I do want to go, then I should do it here. He's still saying that if I want to go overseas, he won't stop me but I don't want to go overseas like this. This feels like if I do go, I'll betray his trust or his hopes for me.

We both worked last night until 7am. As usual, she went home after work while I went straight to my day job. While driving home around 3pm I received a call from my sister. She tells me she was at the place where she parks the trailer and that she forgot the keys at home. She was going on a little camping trip with her toddler (she’s a single mom) wed-fri. I told her I couldn’t because I didn’t wanna drive 3 hours round trip in rush hour traffic when I haven’t even slept yet.

She responded with “why does that matter” with a bit of attitude.

17,1esbcgb,WIBTA if I remove an autistic player from my D&D game?,"I (21M) have been playing D&D online for about 4 years now. This one player I'll call Mike (23M) has been in the group from the very beginning. At the start, he wasn't very disruptive. I was new to the game and his knowledge was valuable in helping me learn the ropes. But in later years as I've become a DM for the group, I've been noticing some disruptive behaviors that I'm struggling with. 

Firstly, he has a good memory for the rules. This means any time a player asks me a clarifying question on a ruling, he will jump in and try to speak before me, almost sounding eager to answer first. He also has a tendency to metagame, which his memory helps him a lot. 

He also has a real bad habit of interrupting other people in general. Whether it be in roleplay or in conversation. Of course with the Discord delay and the fact that half the group doesn't use webcams, there's bound to be talking over each other, but this is in a league of its own. An NPC is talking to the party? He talks over the party leader. Roleplay between player characters? If his character is in the same zip code he will butt into the conversation like he was there the whole time. It's been so bad a few times that someone will be five words into a sentence and he will just start talking, and won't stop despite the person trying to continue on with what they were saying.

This is especially true in combat. I have a total of five players, and I like to run harder combats. This means that it can sometimes take a while to get to someone's turn. With his knowledge on the game, he will sometimes cut people off with recommendations on what they should do. If someone wants to do something fun or risky, he'll cut them off and say ""you have this thing, why not use that?"" or if he's in a bad mood or the encounter is difficult, he'll grumble into the mic.

Another thing is he has atrocious tech issues. His Chromebook laptop barely runs the VTT we are using at a good speed, he consistently cuts out or disconnects from the VC, his microphone has consistently been cutting out and glitching, causing us to constantly remind him to fix his stuff.

Now I understand that some of these things he can't help. Due to his autism, he says that he feels like he needs to get his thoughts out onto the open or else he'll lose them. Totally get that. He's also a college student in a pretty big brain field, so not having the time or money to acquire a decent laptop is also completely understandable. But when everything comes together into a disruptive mess that kills so much momentum in-game is where I struggle to justify keeping him around. 

I consider him a friend, and we've been gaming together for years now. But as my and my group's expectation for the game evolves, it becomes more and more of a headache to run the game. And it's not like we haven't sat down and talked to him about this. I've spoken to him in private and with the rest of the group about this a few times now.

19,1esb2yt,"AITA for ""talking s**t"" about my mother?","for context: Me (F15) and my (strict-ish) mom (F43) have been having more of these little arguments lately. Sometimes they're pretty reasonable (ex. me eating too much candy or something) but sometimes they're straight up ridiculous (ex. when she was convinced that my old-a** samsung was better than the latest iphones (shes very anti-iOS lol )).

So, me and my classmates/friends have recently turned 15, and we are now legally allowed to drive mopeds and such, which is very helpful in a
small town like ours, where it's around 14km (like 9ish miles) for me even to the nearest grocery store.

Most of my friends have mopeds and they can now go do some little part- time jobs and earn money for themselves. I do not have a moped, nor did i have a job this summer, because of social anxiety, didnt want to look for a job and i couldnt really go anyways, which now leads us back to the argument part:

Today I brought up the fact that one of my friends (lets call her Maya) works 2 jobs at the moment to afford all the gas and also some other pretty important stuff i wont get into now. (I brought this up because we had plans for tomorrow but she had work so she couldnt make it.)

So i tell this to my mom, and she started going on about how Maya's so hardworking and lovely, but it quickly turned into her complaining about how i havent done any work during the summer and how i am lazy and how i should ""take notes"" about how hardworking my friends are.

Now, i love my mother very much, but this has been kind of a daily thing that everyday i bring something up and somehow she makes it about me in a negative way. I don't like arguing so i dont usually even fight back unless its like VERY ridiculous.

Here's the possible a-hole part: I have started complaining to my friends pretty much everyday about the things my mom says and i might come off as mean in some of them, even saying stuff like ""f*ck, now shes criticizing me for some s**t again"" (direct quote from me). 

Some of my friends think I'm the a-hole for not keeping it between me and my mother and how im ""hypocritical for criticizing my mother for criticizing me"". I just think it's relieving to kinda just tell them outloud about whats going on, especially all the ridiculous stuff. But since some of my friends told me i am the a-hole for talking shit about my mother, i've been thinking about this a lot. So, AITA?

And again, I'm only 15, so if im the ridiculous one here, i understand. I also dont speak english as my first or even second language, so im sorry if theres mistakes!!

20,1esarxt,AITA for not responding to my best friend because of surgery,"
I (f, 28) have a best friend (f, 29) with whom I’ve had a very close relationship. We used to meet two to three times a week and were in daily contact over the phone. Then my situation changed because I moved 150 km away. Although she was disappointed, she accepted that we wouldn’t be able to see each other as often anymore.

Four weeks ago, we saw each other in person for the last time. Two days later, she sent me a short message asking how I was doing. However, during that time, I had an unexpected surgery, which she still doesn’t know about. Because of the surgery, I didn’t have the energy to respond.

Now, four weeks later, I’m feeling better, and I’m wondering why I haven’t heard from her since then. Apart from that one message, I haven’t heard anything from her. Wouldn’t a best friend wonder why the other suddenly isn’t responding? Now that I’m healthy again, I’m asking myself why I haven’t heard from her since, even though we used to be in contact every day. If the situation were reversed, I would’ve immediately worried why she wasn’t responding and if something had happened to her.

Now I’m wondering if I'm the asshole because I did'nt responde to her message. So she would be right not to text me again.

My partner and I planned for him to take our baby and two kids (from my previous ex) to go visit his parents while I’m gone. When he messaged his Mom to let her know what time they will arrive. She proceeded to say that she’s not feeling well enough and to only bring the baby with him. She also added that she just want to focus on the baby.

For context, my kids are big enough to play on their own and are pretty independent. My partner is also more than capable enough to take care of our three kids. 

I also want to add that his parents are super traditional. As a single mother coming into their son’s life, I’ve always felt like an outsider. And his mom made sure of it. 
For instance, my partner invited me and one of my child (this was before we had our baby) to join a family dinner. His mom stared me down and was very upset that my child and I was there. She then proceeded to get up and tell my partner to go outside with her and told him to never bring me around to any functions, holidays or celebrations. He then asked why she dislike me, but she wouldn’t give him an answer. I can think of many more instances as to why I feel the way I feel from my experiences with his parents.

In conclusion, I decided that it’s best to not bring our baby to his parents. I just feel that she’s making an excuse not to have my children around. I told my partner that I will not enable and tolerate that type of behaviour. I have been flexible and accommodating. I even encouraged my partner to bring the baby with him alone last week to visit. But it is not okay to treat me and my children like an outsider.

I also asked my partner to have a chat with his mom. But my partner said it wouldn’t matter because he can’t force his mom to let my children go there. He also said that he feels like him and our baby are in the middle of this.

I like sports and video games while she prefers to spend all her time in her room drawing. She actually is a pretty good artist and has received a hefty scholarship to a pretty good art school. A few months ago, she decided to go through our father's old writing materials and poems and started making illustrations to go along with all the poems.

Maia plans on getting one of her drawings from her project tattooed and asking our mother to pay for it. Which I think is pretty narcissistic. Like you love your own work so much you have to get it tattooed? And ask Mom to pay? I didn't want to confront her about it in front our mom so I followed her up to her room after dinner and told her what I thought.

27,1es9yp8,AITA for Writing a Story Based on My Ex,"I (33F) recently published a short story on a popular writing platform. The story was inspired by a past relationship with my ex, ""Parker"" (34M). In the story, I changed all the names, altered significant details, and fictionalized most of the events to create a story that was only loosely based on reality. 

Parker somehow found the it and immediately recognized himself in one of the characters. He reached out to me, furious, accusing me of airing our ""dirty laundry"" for the world to see. He said that despite the changes I made, the essence of what happened was still there, and that I had no right. He demanded that I take the story down, saying it was a violation of his privacy and an unfair portrayal of our past.

I tried to explain that the story was a work of fiction and that I had gone out of my way to make sure it wasn’t a direct retelling of our specific relationship. I pointed out that writers often draw inspiration from their lives and that the character was a blend of different experiences, not just ours. I also mentioned that no one who read the story would know it was about him unless he told them.

He still says that I crossed a line. He’s been telling mutual friends about it, and now some of them are saying I should have been more careful, even if I didn’t mean any harm. On the other hand, others argue that as a writer, I have the right to express myself.

28,1es9jgl,WIBTA if I don't help my parents,"So I (33f) just learned my parents (63m, 54f) are losing their house and they asked to stay with me and my partner (33m) until they get back on their feet.

My parents haven't been the best with finances and this whole situation with the house started back when I was still in HS. They claimed it was settled and I had no clue anything was wrong with the house situation until they asked to stay.

My dad is semi retired (working weekends only) and my mom hasn't worked since since about my last year of school. They don't have any real savings. Up until now they would ask to borrow money frequently, which I dread every time and say no to because we have our own things to deal with.

I live in a different state meaning my dad would have to find a whole new job instead of increasing hours at his current place of work.

They think that if they find a part time job they will get enough to:
Pay for storage for their belongings
Pay us rent of some sort for letting them stay
Save up for an apartment of sorts

We have a small house, but we do have a spare bedroom used for if someone stayed a weekend or a small amount of time.

Neither my partner or I think this is a good idea, because we know that if things don't work out (which seems likely given this economy in the US) that they will stay indefinitely.

Financially, we can't afford that. Mentally, we definitely can't last with that. We just would clash too much. (Example, a rule is no smoking of any kind IN the house. I have lung issues that they knew about my entire life. They smoked in the guest room and then were actually surprised when the entire house smells like smoke and I'm upset)

They have 2 cats. One I already know didn't get along with my cat (they fought back when we lived with my parents after HS) and the other is old and likely won't do well with my territorial cat or my hyperactive husky. This just makes things more complicated in my opinion, and makes me realize that my parents haven't given any though to any of this.

29,1es9iji,AITA for wanting my birthday present to be a surprise? ,"Me, F19 and my boyfriend M23, have been together for a little over a year now. My birthday is coming up and I've been really busy with moving into my first ever dorm room at university, plus work, and saying goodbye to all of my friends who I likely won't see for a very long time.

Throughout our entire relationship, whenever special occasions would happen and my boyfriend wanted to get me something, I would tell him what I wanted and he would get it for me. This would go even for simple things like flowers and things like that, because if I didn't ask, he wouldn't know. He maintained that he's bad with gift giving and I maintained that I hate surprises being held over my head which I think he misconstrued as me hating surprise presents at all. In actuality I just hate people teasing me about it.

I started the conversation by saying that this time I wanted my birthday present to be a surprise. He is surprised about this and starts getting anxious, and I tell him that just this once I'm too busy to put in the effort to decide what I want, and was hoping he could. He starts getting anxious about it and saying he doesn't know what to get me. I open a Google search and show him how easy it is to Google things pertaining to the things him and I like, and present ideas. This doesn't help, and by this point he's crying and the situation escalates from there. He was crying out of pure fear of getting me a present that I didn't specifically ask for. It made me feel guilty, selfish, and evil for asking for it to change even just once. I told him at this point that I just don't want anything at all. He said no, that he'd do it, just that he wishes I would have told him that I didn't like the way things were. I told him it was literally just this one time that I'm really busy, and that him crying over that is villanizing me for something I didn't even do, and that it makes me not even want a birthday present at all because of how horrible it makes both of us feel. I said word for word ""you crying over it feels like you're villainizing me for something I didn't do, in an attempt to make me feel guilty so that ill console you and make me tell you you don't have to do it.""

This wasn’t unusual, my sister tends to have impromptu meetings with friends and she thinks at 12, my niece is old enough to stay alone for a few hours during the daytime. My niece hadn’t eaten all day though, so she called me. I tried to reach my sister via call and text, but she didn’t answer, so I called my BIL at work since I wanted permission to go to their place. He said I could go over and check on my niece.

When I arrived, the house was a little messy, but my sister had a schedule and I didn't want to interrupt it. I just washed the dishes I needed to cook. I didn't order from out because my niece has some severe food allergies and I didn't want to risk it while both her parents were out so I cooked knowing what to leave out. My BIL came home hungry, and since I’d made extra food, I heated some up for him and left the rest for my sister in case she wanted some. I then left, as my BIL was home so I didn't have to watch over my niece.

Later, my sister finally responded angrily to my texts, upset that I’d fed her daughter and husband, and done chores in her house. She accused me of attempting to outdo her and I explained that I wasn’t trying to judge her or outdo her, but my niece hadn’t eaten, and I wasn’t going to deny my BIL food in his own home. I apologized, but she said it was no excuse and told me to just leave things next time and not interfere.

My dad thinks I did nothing wrong, but my mom said not to meddle in my sister’s household. I have no ill intentions and see my BIL as a big brother since he and my sister are high school sweethearts. There are 0 feelings or physical contact outside of piggyback rides that stopped when I turned 12 and congratulatory hugs on special occasions. I feel bad for making my sister angry, but I don’t think I did anything wrong. AITA?

EDIT: As a commenter suggested, I'm adding more relevant info. There wasn't food in the house. Only raw groceries since my niece is allergic to a lot of processed/ready-made food and she's not allowed to use the gas stove unsupervised, she called me since her mom was unreachable and her dad isn't pleased when someone calls when he's at work. Why her parents didn't leave things she could eat if they intended on leaving her alone? I have no clue. I made extras with the intention of kind of meal-prepping for my niece in case this happened again. I also sent my sister a follow-up text that I got permission from my BIL to enter and keep my niece some company, she just didn't read it until later that day when she came home and found out what happened since she said she switches her phone off when she's with friends.

UPDATE: A lot of you think a 12-year-old should be perfectly self-sustaining, that's your opinion but I was hoping the common consensus would be that when a child calls you in distress, you check on them and help, no matter what the issue is. It's a CHILD. But as for the situation, my post was found by my BIL and he called to ask if I posted this. When I confirmed, he told me he read the comments that said my sister was acting sus and was probably being unfaithful. It got to him real bad so he's going to have a very serious convo with her and has hired a caretaker with medical training for my niece for the time being in case there's a falling out with my sister, to help meal prep for her and be around while he's at work and my sister is out doing whatever (his words).

The problem is with my MIL (70) and my son, let’s call him John. Since a few months my MIL is commenting on the fact that my son wears normal clothes ( normal being nikey, adidas and Reebok) while my daughters wear ,,high fashion,, stuff. I tried to make her unterstand that John does not care about clothing and that I buy him most of his clothes. He spends a lot of money on pc games and graphic cards and always wants the newest pro iPhone. She accused me of favoring my daughters and spending more money for them because they wear more expensive clothes. I tried to explain to her that John's gaming pc setup alone is twice as expensive as both of my girls' wardrobes combined but she didn’t care and started to ,,compensate,,. She started to give money and gifts exclusively to John and not to her granddaughters. When my husband and I told her that this is not fair she said that I should taste my own medicine. The relationship between my MIL and my daughters went downhill pretty fast but she doesn’t care. She’s to fixated on John. My husband warned her and had many debates with her but she is adamant and even worse started to lift our dirty laundry in public and spreading the lie that John is a second class citizen in our home. 

I finally flipped this past Sunday. She accused me again of favoritism in front of my SIL. I asked her to go to John’s f***** room and check the stuff there herself and then google the prices. I told her to shut the f up already and stop damaging my sons relationship with his sisters with her venom. She left my house crying and pathetically threatened me.

AITA?  ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-14,"AITA for telling my MIL to finally shut up and stop accusing me of favoritism?  I (39f) have three kids (18f, 16f and 15m) with my husband (48). 

The problem is with my MIL (70) and my son, let’s call him John. Since a few months my MIL is commenting on the fact that my son wears normal clothes ( normal being nikey, adidas and Reebok) while my daughters wear ,,high fashion,, stuff. I tried to make her unterstand that John does not care about clothing and that I buy him most of his clothes. He spends a lot of money on pc games and graphic cards and always wants the newest pro iPhone. She accused me of favoring my daughters and spending more money for them because they wear more expensive clothes. I tried to explain to her that John's gaming pc setup alone is twice as expensive as both of my girls' wardrobes combined but she didn’t care and started to ,,compensate,,. She started to give money and gifts exclusively to John and not to her granddaughters. When my husband and I told her that this is not fair she said that I should taste my own medicine. The relationship between my MIL and my daughters went downhill pretty fast but she doesn’t care. She’s to fixated on John.

35,1es6kgg,AITA for picking up a lost apple watch,"A few weeks ago, I was out sightseeing with my family. I was at a small waterfall when my mom saw this apple watch lying off road, covered in dirt.

As there was no security or guard at that place, we waited for 10 minutes to see if someone comes to pick it up. We had already spent about 30 minutes at that place and no one else came during that time.

We thought someone might actually steal it, so we picked the watch thinking we'll somehow be able to contact the owner and return it to them, but didn't know how yet. I don't own an iPhone, but my family does, and I knew apple has this find my network, which will be able to use my family's iPhone to send the owner the location of the watch.

We left that waterfall and went to a nearby park (we had a pretty packed itinerary for spots we had to cover that day for our sightseeing). All this was happening in the outskirts of the city, and police stations were in the city, so I had to wait for a couple of hours before I could visit the police station.

While I was looking online to see how can I contact the owner of a lost apple watch, I saw a young guy and his dad at that park, flustered and restless (which is understandable as this apple watch tech is pretty expensive). They saw us and enquired if we saw an apple watch. I instantly smiled and handed him over his watch. I was happy. I think they were able to track the watch thanks to Apple's find my device network.

But then he started accusing me and my family of stealing and running away his watch. He said he just took the watch off to wash his hands etc. at the waterfall (I didn't see him there). And that I should not take other's stuff and run away. He said tourists are the worst and locals people would never steal the watch, so I should not have picked it up and let it be.

I tried to explain him that I never tried to power it off, and was constantly checking if it would show lost contact information (which it didn't). That I didn't deny having the watch when he asked. I told him I was worried someone might actually steal it and hence I thought I would take it to the police station. I showed him how I was trying to contact the owner on my phone's search history. 

But the young guy and his dad were pretty agitated, and weren't listening to me or my family. They just kept on going how i shouldn't have picked it up. How locals would never do it, and how tourists misbehave etc.

Eventually they left, saying something in the local language. It kinda bummed all of us out for the whole day.

A little backstory 
I (22F) had been together with my ex (24M) for 5 years, since I was 16 and he was 18. We were both pretty close with each others families, I especially with his younger sister (14F), who I since I met her when she was 9 have seen as my own sister, and his former stepmom (his sisters mom).

Me and my ex boyfriend broke up around 6 months ago. For me at the time it was out of the blue, but looking back I could see the signs and I found out afterwards he had cheated on me.

After we broke up we lived together for about a month and a half due to financial reasons on both sides. During that time we both spent a lot of time at his former stepmoms house.
After he moved out of our apartment I still spent a lot of time at them and I also learnt from them he had cheated on me during our relationship, which they also took very strongly too since the reason his sisters mom is no longer with their father is because he had cheated on her multiple times.

And now since then I’ve still been spending a lot of time at their house, chatting and hanging around, I’m also friends with his little sister older half brother (22M) so that makes it so I’m there many times. I’ve also taken his sister out on a few “girl dates” 2-3 times since we broke up, and I’ve now learned that he’s really angry at me and them for still talking.

There’s a lot of other things connected to the breakup that they are angry with him for, but I’ve never been the one to say it to them, since I do believe it’s his family and I shouldn’t be the one to talk bad about him to his family.

My bestfriend Ashley is one of the most thoughtful people I know. One of her love languages is gifts. 

So this weekend we went on a long weekend trip out of state. We arrived on Saturday. She was leaving a day early (yesterday - Tuesday) to get back to work. We spent the day apart as there where some excursions I wanted to do that she wasn't interested in (intentionally waited because of this) and I was leaving early in the morning the next day (today - Wednesday). When I got back to our room she had left a note, which was really sweet (super thoughtful) saying how much she enjoyed our trip and thanking me for inviting her (I was originally going to come alone). Next to the note was a 1000 count puzzle. I love puzzles and she knows that (again super thoughtful). The problem is I only brought a small bag, the kind you have to carry. I prefer to travel light and the puzzle makes it difficult to zip back up. And while not a ton of extra weight, just bulky, the bag isn't durable enough to check.

My bestfriend Ashley is one of the most thoughtful people I know. One of her love languages is gifts. 

So this weekend we went on a long weekend trip out of state. We arrived on Saturday. She was leaving a day early (yesterday - Tuesday) to get back to work. We spent the day apart as there where some excursions I wanted to do that she wasn't interested in (intentionally waited because of this) and I was leaving early in the morning the next day (today - Wednesday). When I got back to our room she had left a note, which was really sweet (super thoughtful) saying how much she enjoyed our trip and thanking me for inviting her (I was originally going to come alone). Next to the note was a 1000 count puzzle. I love puzzles and she knows that (again super thoughtful). The problem is I only brought a small bag, the kind you have to carry. I prefer to travel light and the puzzle makes it difficult to zip back up. And while not a ton of extra weight, just bulky, the bag isn't durable enough to check. I have to lug it from the hotel (taking local bus to airport that includes a 10 minute walk) and around the airport.

46,1es3lv8,WIBTA if I threw out my roommate's bowl and food because it's riddled with mold?,"I (24M) have been living with the same roommates for the past couple years, and generally things are fine, except my roommate Richard (28M) has a nasty habit of buying a shit load of food and then leaving it to rot in the fridge. I don't even like using it or going into the kitchen because it's so fucking nasty. I've genuinely been living off of take out and boxed mac and cheese this entire time because I don't feel comfortable storing my food in what is essentially a cold compost heap. But I can't afford to do that anymore and so I'd like to actually use the fridge. I opened it up yesterday and found three different blocks of moldy cheese, God knows what else, and a bowl of tomato soup covered in seran wrap that's essentially just a petri dish at this point. It took me a moment to identify it as soup because the surface of it is 80% mold. 

Honestly I just want to bin it all. I can't imagine Richard would actually miss this shit because my understanding is that he does this because of depression and executive dysfunction and not because he's a hoarder or something. But at the same time that bowl doesn't belong to me, I don't know who it belongs to, or if it predates all of us. I know that throwing out something that doesn't belong to me is technically stealing, and that might make me TA. But at the same time it has two or three species of mold growing in it, I'm not fucking washing it, and I really don't want to risk accidentally eating out of it in the future (it's identical to two or three other bowls). 

I know I should probably talk to Richard about this and maybe even ask him to clean it up. But I don't think he'd listen to me.

He just kind of just treats me like an annoying little kid he has to get along with because we live together and because we're both friends with one of our other roommates.

In the past few weeks we have begun to collect furniture, decorations, and other household necessities we come across as well as seeing family and friends who we might not get a chance to see very often after we move.

So, he did not want to attend dinner and instead told her that the next day would not work and never tried to go see her after.

49,1es2twq,AITA for being mad my friend didn’t pick us up?,"A friend of mine moved to another country with her partner six years ago. I considered her a good friend, though I haven’t seen her in years.
We were pregnant around the same time, so we chatted often about pregnancy and compared experiences of pregnancy/birth/parenting between the US and the country she lived in. 

Anyway, a week ago she messages our friend group that she will be in town along with her partner and daughter to visit for a month. I’m super excited to catch up with my old friend, and finally meet her daughter.

My husband and I were already planning on taking a trip from Seattle to Portland to visit our family. We decided taking the train would be the best option, since we have a toddler and the ability to get up and walk around is really nice. (Driving by car to Portland takes twice the time, since our three year old can’t handle sitting for long stretches- so we have to pull over a lot along the way for exercise)

We were trying to figure out a solution to get to and from the train station. Since we have a toddler, we have to have a car seat. And, we had a lot of luggage/stroller/travel car seat, plus toddler- so public transportation wasn’t an option.

I reached out to said friend, I thought it would be the perfect exchange to let her borrow our car while we’re gone in exchange for a ride to and from the train station. 
My friend was super into the idea and agreed to the days and times we needed to be dropped off and picked up. Confirmed the times with her over text as well as in person. 

They also offered to pet and house sit for us. We didn’t really need help in that area, since we already arranged for a pet sitter. But, they mentioned they were staying on a friend’s boat while in town, boat life can be tough with a kid. They daid they were only able to stay on this boat because the owner only used it to race once a year in the summer.

So, we agreed to let them stay at our place and use both our cars.

Yesterday, I texted our group thread with my friend and her partner that we were on the train home and we’d be in touch if we had any delays. Her partner texted me back that they would not be picking us up from the station. He said they would try parking the car nearby, and hide the keys somewhere for us.

The area the train station is in isn’t particularly safe at night. It’s not somewhere I’d want to have my car parked with a key hidden somewhere. And it’s especially not somewhere I want to be dragging around all our luggage and our toddler through at night while searching for our car and keys. 

They said the boat they were staying on was set to sail at 7pm for the race that night, so they couldn’t pick us up at 8pm. I checked the race schedule, and the schedule must have been out pretty far in advance, so I have no doubt they already had this commitment before they also committed to picking us up from the station.

51,1es260f,AITA Timelimits in the bathroom? ,"Had an early morning flight and was on a connection in ATL. I went to the restroom, and after finishing up, I was washing my hands and glanced at myself in the mirror for maybe 5 seconds. Then this lady comes up behind me and says, ""Can I get in?"" I thought she was asking for paper towels or soap, but she actually wanted to use the sink I was at.

There were 6 other sinks, some with people who had been there longer than me, but she decided my station was the one she wanted and that I should leave because, in her opinion, my time was up. Really, lady?

I told her I wasn’t done, and she responded, ""You're just looking at yourself."" I said, ""I don't care, I wasn't done,"" and we went back and forth with me repeating, ""I don't care, I wasn’t done."" Finally, I told her to ""f*** off and get a life.""

I’m not someone who usually gets into spats with people, but for some reason, she triggered me. It felt like she had an attitude and singled me out, even though there were people who had been at their sinks much longer than me. I was only at the sink for maybe 20-30 seconds before any of this happened.

It made me wonder if she was trying to exhibit some kind of superiority by getting me to move. As I was drying my hands and looking in the mirror for a few seconds, she started with me. Also, why didn’t she ask the 5-6 other women at the sinks to move? Why did she target me? Is it because I’m a POC and they weren’t? (Not trying to go that route, but the thought crossed my mind.)

Last I checked, there wasn’t a time limit on using the sink in the bathroom. Or did I miss the memo?

52,1es2132,AITAH for keeping my miscarriage a secret?,"
I (20F) and my husband (24M) have been married just about 2 years. My BIL and his wife (26) had their first baby 7 months ago. He’s the cutest little baby and I love being his auntie. But now that means we are getting asked when we’re having a baby. I would always brush it off saying “oh we’ll see” or “I don’t know maybe later” but I wasn’t sure if I was ready after what happened.

For context, I had never been on birth control before so I was still pretty new to it. I used the nueva ring so I would have it in for 3 weeks then have my “period” (doc said it’s normal not to bleed). When I put it in we had 2 days before we got married. The doc said it isn’t 100% effective the first 24-72 hours but there shouldn’t be any issues. Well we get married, go on our honeymoon, and come back ready for married life. A week after we come home I took the birth control out but I didn’t bleed. (Which I was told is normal) I felt super nauseous, and just thought that it was my period, so I kept it out. A few days into having one in I felt still felt sick. So being concerned, I took a pregnancy test. Sure enough I could see a very faint line. Panicking I took it out, and made an appointment with my doc. That night I started bleeding pretty bad. I told my husband, and felt awful cause I thought I just killed our baby. He assured that it’s going to be okay and that we can go to the er to see what’s going on. I was just shy of 6 weeks. I asked my husband if we could keep it between us for the time being. And he said we could talk about it when I was ready. Well I never was.

Back to present day some months go by and my brother and his wife (24) have their first. This lead to my family asking me when I was going to get pregnant. I was getting fed up with it so I ignored them. Finally 2 days ago, we were at my in laws for dinner and I again was asked when were we going to have kids, I blurted out and said “Well after having a miscarriage it’s hard to want to get pregnant!” My MILs face dropped and got upset that I hadn’t said anything sooner and that she should’ve known when I was pregnant. I just walked out to the car my husband following after me. We went home and my husband said maybe we should’ve told her cause she’s had a miscarriage too. And I said well I didn’t want to tell them because of how it happened.

I just really need to know, AITAH? Should I have talked to my MIL sooner?

Wow, thank you for all the kind words. And thank you to those who shared their losses, much love ❤️ 
So I’ve see a few people ask questions about when I got married, and if I’ve gone to therapy.
So my husband and I met about a week after I turned 18, he was 21. We got married a month before I turned 19, and he was 22. Yes it was young, but he was the best thing that happened to me. My parents were emotionally abusive so I got married faster than originally thought. But he’s been the best
As of therapy, I had been seeing a therapist for the abuse for 8 months, then stopped, the miscarriage was almost 2 years ago, so about 6 months after I came to terms with it I went to therapy again for grief and loss specifically. 

Edit:
I’m seeing a lot of people taking that I “blurted” means I yelled. I didn’t yell, I said that assertively to make it clear I didn’t want to talk about it anymore. ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-14,"AITAH for keeping my miscarriage a secret?

53,1es1uv4,AITA for not allowing my brother-in-law to meet my newborn?,"This happen a while ago but I decided just now to share this. Lmk what you guys think. :)

So I had just given birth about 4 weeks ago. Around this time my sister was coming to visit  and she asked me if her husband can come and meet my newborn. Her husband and I never really got along very well. The last encounter I had with him he was extremely rude to me. I wouldn’t have felt comfortable having him around me and my newborn baby. So because of this I felt I had to respectfully decline.

Let me explain the last encounter we had. This happen about a year before I gave birth. So I was walking to my sister’s apartment. As I was going I saw her husband drunk, talking to another women right outside the building they lived in. Maybe this was none of my business but when i saw this I felt like I had to let my sister know. It was obvious he knew it was me who told her bc he saw me looking at him talking to the other women. Later on he came to their home and once he saw me he got upset and started insulting me, being extremely rude, then he kicked me out the house.
My sister had to apologize for his behavior but he never did. 

Okay so back to where we are now. This was why I didn’t feel comfortable having him come to my house and meet my newborn. I had postpartum blues so I was in a pretty vulnerable place, I only allowed my closest family to come to my house.

Unfortunately since this happen it’s kind of broken up my relationship with my sister, for some reason she got upset because I told her I wasn’t comfortable having her husband meet my newborn.

54,1es1qqr,AITA for crying at my best friend's wedding,"My best friend had her wedding a few months back and I was one of her bridesmaids. We could pick our dresse but we had to clear it with her first. I visited her in person with my dress for her to clear. She was fine with it said I looked beautiful etc. 

On the day of the wedding I put on my dress and immediately she and her mother had this look on their faces. They asked if I had another dress or a jacket. For context, I am a bigger girl but this dress was not revealing or risqué. 

Her mother kept giving me looks and asking if I think I look okay.

Fast forward, wedding happened and I got a lot of compliments on the dress. While at the reception her mother asked again if I have a jacket and I told her I have one, but it's in the hotel room. I asked if she thinks I should go get my jacket and her response was looking me up and down and saying yes I should get the jacket and cover up. 

I honestly felt insulted and I think it was just the remarks of the whole day building up but I started crying. I did not mean to burst out crying but the comments got too much. 

I went for a walk to try and calm down but my face and eyes were already puffy from crying. This was before the bridal party photos and unfortunately I showed up with a puffy face. I tried fixing my makeup but there was no hope hiding the red eyes. So we took the photos and that was it.

She later asked her mom about her comments and her mom said she never said anything like that. She now thinks I overreacted and blames me for ruining her bridal party photos. 

I really did not intend to show up with a puffy face and red eyes but I feel like I should pay the photographer to redo their photos.

I tried speaking to her a few times after the wedding but she either doesn't pick up or the call is an awkward silence most of the time. Last night I spoke to her again and she admitted they are angry at me for ruining their photos.

55,1es1myi,WIBTA if I temporarily moved away from my husband and child?,"I (29F) met my husband (29M) during my university studies in his country in Europe. I'm from an Asian country, but wanted to study and work in Europe to get a good degree and find a high paying job. While studying I met the most amazing person I could've hoped for. We have been happily together for 8 years, married for 3 and expecting our first child.

The problem is that I thought I would be fine living in another country. But being separate from my parents, especially during the covid-era, clearly affected my mental health and made me sad and miserable. I'm much happier and calmer living with my parents in my home country. Early in the relationship we discussed about where to live if we got married, and I think my husband doesn't want to move to my country. We have traveled there together many times, he absolutely loves it and my family, so he agreed that we can spend our summer and winter holidays in my country, but rest of the time we live in his country where we own a house, both have high-paying jobs and otherwise stable life.

Now I feel trapped and anxious about the thought of having to live in his country for the rest of my life. Everything there is great (apart from the food), good salaries, safe environment, free education and healthcare etc, but I'm planning to move to my country and work remotely for some time. I would like to spend many years in my country every now and then, depending on our job situation. The future child makes it more difficult because of the kindergarten and school, but he can attend school in my country as well. My husband disagrees with this plan, since he doesn't want to abandon his job and our apartment and live in my country. If I moved without him, he would also like to keep our child in his country (he is 100% capable, an amazingly considerate husband and a great future father).

So I wanted to ask WIBTA if I temporarily moved back to my parents without my husband? My parents don't speak English so they can't move to us, and I miss the environment and food of my city.

We now know it was because she liked dad and wanted me to like her. I was disgusted with my dad. He tried denying it, then he tried to convince mom it was a one night stand and nothing more and he'd forever regret it, then he wanted her to stay with him and raise the baby he knocked the other woman up with, since they only had me. Even when he moved in with the other woman he kept trying to stop mom from going through with the divorce. He tried to get me to talk to mom on his behalf. He told me mom was the one breaking up our family and not him.

Then when he gave up and accepted mom wouldn't take him back, which is when the other woman lost the baby, he tried to get me on board with things. I ignored all calls and texts from him. I couldn't block him while still a minor. But I didn't reply and I didn't see my dad face to face during this. I knew I wanted him out of my life for good.

He tried to make me see him but he failed. And once I turned 18 it was over for him.

He ended up marrying the other woman and now they're expecting a kid together. I don't want anything to do with any of that, including the baby, and yes even if I don't have to see them I have zero interest in knowing that child and any future children.

She wants to know me and have me for dinner and maybe I could spend some time with them. She tried the whole ""we're family now"" crap and I left early because I did not want to deal with it.

57,1es1i1k,AITAH for not going along with a change in plans that involves me driving 4 extra hours to give my childhood best friend a ride to the airport. ,"I live across the country from where I grew up and tbh in the 11 years that I’ve lived here I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve had visitors. Ive gone back a few times and do my best to make the effort to see those I once knew better. 

My best friends are two brothers. One lives on the West coast and the other one the East coast. I also live on the west coast about 2 hours away from WC Brother. In the 8 years that he’s lived in the west coast he’s never visited my apartment. I’ve gone down to his apartment at least once every 3-6 months. 

EC brother is coming to visit and is flying into major airport that’s 25 minutes from my house. WC brother is picking him up and was supposed to bring him to airport for return flight. I invited WC brother to come up to my place in the city for Thursday and Friday night and offered to drive EC brother to airport for early flight. WC brothers response was that he’d let me know if they had time, but that he wasn’t sure if they’ would. Mind you this was just after he told me that they would just be hanging around his area and didn’t have much of a plan. My response “ Okay np, I’ll talk to EC brother and see what he wants to do. 

EC brother is down to come up to city on Thursday and stay there till flight on Sat morning. Day EC brother arrives I call him to confirm Thursday with WC and lock in my time off for work. Right after we confirm noon in the city, EC texts me about WC wanting to meet earlier because of traffic and driving at night. N/p 10 am work ? The drive from WC apartment to my place is 2 hours so meet up at noon wouldn’t cause traffic, would leave time to hang, and still avoid night driving during the summer. I’m currently two hours away from my apartment at an off site job. I was planning on driving down that morning after checking in at the job, but np I’ll just roll out first this in am or do a night drive Wednesday. 

Today I got a text from WC brother asking if I would meet them on Friday in his town and drive EC brother to the city and then the airport early next Am. He said he has something’s he wants to do on Friday, but I can come in the afternoon. I was pretty pissed off by this message and haven’t responded. It feels like I’m being asked to take a Friday off work to drive 4 hours and when there will be traffic to hanging out in a small town for maybe an hour or two before I drive 2 hours back through traffic with EC to the city for a free private room and then a free early ride to the airport. The reason I offered to take him in the first place was to help WC brother and because I thought it would be fun to have EC and WC stay at my house for a few days. Now I just feel like a chauffeur and a free room. 

I’m thinking about responded that I have a lot of work and need to stay on the job till Friday night. The whole thing put a dirty taste in my mouth.

58,1es0z7m,AITA for not going on a family trip because they don't let us to bring my fiancé's dog along?,"My (24F) parents (60M, 48F) planned a mini (3 days) family trip as they do every year. They invited both my fiancé (28M) and my younger brother’s gf. 

I’ve been dating with my fiancé for over 2 years, but we got engaged just about 3 months ago. My brother (20M) has been dating his girlfriend since 9th grade, so she’s like family. For my fiancé, that was not the case. He didn’t join any of our previous family trips when we were just dating. This was going to be his first time joining us. I was so excited.

Let me start by saying this; My fiancé's dog is not just a pet. She's a seeing-eye dog. He's fully visually impaired and he NEEDS her. She's not just our pet, but also basically his mobility aid. She's also the sweetest, most calm dog you will ever see.

Long story short, when my mom ""found out"" we were planning to bring her with us, she got surprised and asked me if we really thought bringing **that dog** along was a good idea. I said “of course, what else did she think was going to happen?""

Apparently, that was a ridiculous idea. They love her but certainly don't want her on the family trip. I told her I'm sorry, but that's not an option. If she wants us to be there, ""that dog"" will also be there. Every time we went on a trip with my fiancé, she was always there and never caused an issue.

My mom told me she respects that.  We can spend our couple trips however we want, but this is a family trip, and we must respect their wishes. I didn't know what to say to that. The only thing I could say is I'm sorry, but we can't attend if they don't let us bring my fiancé's seeing-eye dog.

Then she got furious, she started calling me names , told me I’m being ungrateful, disrespectful etc. I didn't want to argue with her anymore, so I just hung up the phone. Then my dad called me to fix things up. He said it's just a 3-day trip, and I could very well “guide” my fiancé if I wanted to. I'm the one making things harder and even if he can't join, I should still come. 

This made me lose it completely. I told him if my brother's girlfriend is going to be there, my fiancé should absolutely be there and I'm not making anything harder. They are the ones making this harder, and honestly, this is textbook discrimination. 

My dad completely dismissed me, telling me to “shut up” and that if they were bigots, they wouldn't have let me get engaged to him. They always let him bring her to family dinners. This is the one time they asked for a favor. I should have been more understanding. He said i should be ashamed for making my mom cry when all she wanted was a small trip with both her kids.

Now I feel as if I'm a horrible daughter. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-14,"AITA for not going on a family trip because they don't let us to bring my fiancé's dog along?

59,1es0u8n,AITA for telling a friend that what I eat is none of his business?,"It happened a while ago when I was living in university dorms. We have a small in-campus fast-food franchise besides the cafeteria owned by university. Food in our cafeteria is garbage but since we have no option but to pay the whole fees for dorms (living cost + meals), I usually eat there. But I occasionally treat myself with a burger since that's among the least expensive item there. Now I have this friend and since we both live in dorms and share classes, we see each other quite often. And the fast food place is on the way to the dorms from main building so we are mostly walking together with our friends or sometimes just the two of us. So on days when I'm going to get some fast food I'd let him know that I'm gonna stop by here so he can leave without me. He'd join me but won't get anything for himself, awkward but no big deal since it's his choice. I'm just taking my first bite and he would start saying stuff like, ""you're gonna look awful when you get overweight, especially when you're so short"" or ""nobody likes fat girls, you should not eat burgers and get an energy bar since that's more healthy"". I brushed it off at first and didn't refuse him tagging along out of politeness which was dumb.

I had lost a significant amount of weight post-covid and exercise daily so I'm pretty confident I can maintain my health and decided to not let his comments bother me. Now this escalated quickly and this guy started talking about how I might maintain my weight right now but I'm definitely gonna gain quite some when I get pregnant and that it's gonna make me look horrible because I'm short. Yes I'm short so what, this smartass didn't even consider that he's only a couple inches taller than me and while I do not condone body-shaming in any way I might've done that in this case. I told him that why he would even think about my pregnancy is beyond me and what I eat is none of his effing business so whether he likes me while I'm chunky to the max or not is something I couldn't care less about, I should've stopped there but I added that if I'm short then what that makes him for being 2 inches taller than me? He ofcourse didn't like that comment and called me an AH and entitled for not appreciating his concerns towards my health. Next day, while hanging out with other friends in the group he said that he wouldn't hangout with them when I was here which I expected. So our mutual friends wanted to know what happened, I told them and since I had a class I left soon after. Later I received texts from mutual friends with mixed opinions.

My roommate and a few friends think I did the right thing. But some friends told me I took it too far by mentioning his height and should apologize so I think I might be an AH for that. So reddit AITA?

60,1erzzc4,AITA for not reaching out to my BFF first in this situation?,"A little bit of context: I was raised in a hyper religious household and still live there during breaks at university. 

My parents don't know I go out, have tasted alcohol etc etc. When I want to go clubbing or out past 10pm, I lie and say I'm staying at my best friend’s house.
On Sunday night me and by best friend went to a concert and then clubbing (and we had decided to leave at 2.30am max).

While we were out clubbing a guy she barely knew was texting her. At around 1am she said we should go over to his house. I said no, I don't feel comfortable or want to do this situation again. Previously, I was forced to go with her to a random guy's accommodation, and stay in their freezing  kitchen (middle of December) while they did it.
I was a bit annoyed cause this is the second time in our friendship she'd blown of the rest of our plans for a guy.

I reluctantly agree because I don't want to be that person. We get there, randomly watch TV for 1.5hrs together till they finally go up. At 3.40am I call her phone, to see if she's done so we can go back to her house (I obviously can't show up at my house at this time, and we had already previously agreed to sleep at her house). She doesn't pick up but eventually comes down the stairs.
Unbelievably, she asks me to stay the night here cause she ""wants to cuddle"" and it seems rude if she leaves straight after. I can't even explain the anger that rushed through me. I outright told her I was uncomfortable and didn’t want to, and we should just go back to hers like previously planned. Then she seemed annoyed at me. She said nothing would happen to me downstairs and that she's known him for 6 months. 

I was anxious for 2 main reasons: I didn't see him lock his front door when we came in (I walked in last) and that this is a random guy I've never met before, and that she barely knew.
I was pissed off and she knew that fact, and obviously due to my home situation, she knows I don't have any choice but to comply. So I said okay angrily and stayed awake for the entire night in the (again, freezing living room) due to my anxiety. She had promised me a breakfast at her work to almost apologise I think?

She had work at 10am in the morning and by 8.50am, I didn't hear anything from upstairs, so I called to make sure she was up. Surprisingly she sounded annoyed at me, and said she was getting ready. In the uber to her work and when she came downstairs, we barely spoke or acknowledged each other. We got to her job 5 mins before she started her shift, I didn't get the breakfast (doubt she even remembered) and I just left as soon as she started cause I had work later that day too.

We've been mates for 6 years and counting and this is our 2nd argument, and we clearly don't know how to deal with it properly.
We haven't messaged each other since them at this point. The last argument we had, was her blowing me off for a guy and I ended up reaching out first that time. 
What should I do and am I wrong for being annoyed at her?

62,1erz2kn,WIBTA for telling my friend her partner isn’t invited to my place?,"I (28F) have a friend I went to college with, “Jamie” , we’ve only seen each other 2-3 times  since college IRL due to living far apart; we FaceTime every handful of months. Jamie has lived with roommates up until 2-3 years ago, when she moved in with her partner “Sally” (28?F). Jamie has never lived by herself. I’ve been predominantly single since college and lived with multiple roommates until two months ago, when I got my own place for the first time. 

I FaceTimed with Jamie last night and gave her a video tour of the place, and mentioned that I have a guest bed and two couches so I’m super excited to host friends now that I have the space, if she’d like to come over anytime for like a long weekend I’d love to have her! (With our latest moves we now live “close” to each other, about four hours’ drive away.) She said she’d be down,  it was just me throwing out the offer to her, but Jamie said “we” once or twice in the convo; I thought it was strange but didn’t address it, since it was in passing and not solid plans and surely that would be asked about, if she was referring to Sally?

Well Jamie texted me this morning along the lines of “Sally and I are ironing out our plans for the next few months and we’d love to visit you! What’s the bed situation again etc etc” - Here’s the thing: I don’t know Sally. I’m sure she’s lovely, I have no beef with her, but I don’t KNOW her; I’ve seen her for maybe 20 seconds total of screen time in passing on two FaceTime calls, we’ve exchanged maybe ten words total of “hi how are you”’s, but I’ve never seen her irl and my calls are just with Jamie. We don’t usually talk much about relationships; I could barely tell you 1.5 facts about Sally. I’m VERY territorial / private about my space; I only invite close friends to visit, let alone stay the night. I’ve literally shared a bedroom with Jamie, so I’m comfortable with her, but I don’t know her partner. My other friends are all either single or have pretty independent social lives from their partners; I’m friendly with or friends with many such partners, but invitations have always been just to friends, and if partners have been invited I’ve always explicitly specified it or they have asked me about it, and hanging one on one has never been an issue. And I did not invite Sally, this call was just with Jamie and I only ever referred to her coming over, with most people in my life this has been understood as just them but Jamie has now tacked Sally on without clarifying. 

How do I politely, and with etiquette, mention that Sally isn’t invited? Or do I have to just accept that she’s coming too? Is the etiquette with cohabitating couples that invitations are going to be presumed for both of them unless clarified? I really don’t want to make anyone upset and I have no issue with Sally, but I don’t know her and don’t want a stranger in my space for multiple days and nights. Please advise me!!!

Edit: thank you everyone; I’ve gotten comments across the board, some new perspectives to consider, and I think I’m going to reply and say that I was not aware Sally would want to join but I’m happy to have her, and also ask if we could chat more on FaceTime all 3 of us before they visit. Thanks again!",Asshole,2024-08-14,"WIBTA for telling my friend her partner isn’t invited to my place? I (28F) have a friend I went to college with, “Jamie” , we’ve only seen each other 2-3 times  since college IRL due to living far apart; we FaceTime every handful of months. Jamie has lived with roommates up until 2-3 years ago, when she moved in with her partner “Sally” (28?F). Jamie has never lived by herself. I’ve been predominantly single since college and lived with multiple roommates until two months ago, when I got my own place for the first time. 

I FaceTimed with Jamie last night and gave her a video tour of the place, and mentioned that I have a guest bed and two couches so I’m super excited to host friends now that I have the space, if she’d like to come over anytime for like a long weekend I’d love to have her! (With our latest moves we now live “close” to each other, about four hours’ drive away.) She said she’d be down,  it was just me throwing out the offer to her, but Jamie said “we” once or twice in the convo; I thought it was strange but didn’t address it, since it was in passing and not solid plans and surely that would be asked about, if she was referring to Sally?

Well Jamie texted me this morning along the lines of “Sally and I are ironing out our plans for the next few months and we’d love to visit you!

I'm furious because:

1. J didn't secure the scooter properly

2. He's been using it for a year, and has only put out half the money I had into it, while I struggle financially

3. He now has a car while I'm still without transportation

4. I'm losing out on the remaining money he owes me.

67,1eryl6v,AITA refused to wake up early to pick up my girlfriend,"
My girlfriend’s family and my family have been really close since I was little as our parents are good friends. But we weren’t very close until last year and we got together over the summer.

I m16 start school in 2 weeks and my girlfriend f16 wanted to make our relationship public or something. She wants me to make a huge show of my affection for her by like carrying her bag, accompanying her when going to different classes etc etc. 

I’m alright with that but she told me that she wants to go to school with me every day when school starts. The problem with this is that my girlfriend lives a little far from me, we both live 40 minutes away from the school but on opposite sides. So it would take me almost an hour and a half to get to her place and then another 40 minutes to get to school. I usually wake up at 6 (my school starts at 7) but I’d probably have to wake up at around 430 because my girlfriends like an early riser and always gets to school early and she wants me to align the timing with hers.

I’m ok with this distance as I still want to hang out with her and I’m willing to travel there it’s just that I don’t think I can do it every morning. Plus when school starts I have some clubs which sometimes only end at like 8pm so I’d be back late and I’d have to wake up really early and it’s a whole ordeal. 

I told her that I probably wouldn’t be able to wake up that early and that it was kind of an unreasonable expectation. She got mad and asked if our rs wasn’t worth my time. I said I dont really see the point in me getting up early to pick her up anyways because it’s not like I have a car, we’ll both have to take the subway anyways. She got angrier and has been giving me silent treatment since then. 

My parents feel that I am in the wrong and told me to apologise to her. But I still feel like what she wants from me is in unreasonable.

69,1erxw87,AITA for not trying harder to work with both friend group’s schedules and upsetting my friend,"I (20F) had a falling out with my friend Liz (20F), who I’ve known since seventh grade. Although we were close during the beginning of my second year of college, our friendship has cooled, toward the second semester. Our schedules didn’t align as much, and I noticed she wasn’t making much effort to stay in touch. Despite sending her texts and TikToks, she often left me on read, though she stayed active in a group chat with other friends.

Our group chat has six members, including two I'm particularly close to. Liz recently told Rena (19F) and Jenny (20F) that she no longer considers Cindy (20F) a friend, which shocked us as we had all been friends for years. Liz even stopped texting in our group chat and has since shown little interest in maintaining our friendship. Jenny, Rena, and Cindy message and make plans in a separate gc as Liz has been clear about not wanting to be friends with Cindy.

Recently, I tried to organize hangouts before I leave for a trip and move to LA for university. Cindy is studying abroad soon, and Vicky (20F), who’s back for the summer, is also leaving soon. Liz and Cindy both wanted to meet on the same day, which was the only day Cindy was available. I tried to coordinate a time with Liz and Vicky, but due to Vicky’s scheduling conflict, I continued with plans to meet with Cindy, Rena, and Jenny that day. I informed Liz of my unavailability for the later time and asked about meeting with her the next day when more of the girls in the gc of six would be available. Liz texted me after I was home about being upset about the lack of clear communication regarding the timing and date, which she expressed in a long message.

I drafted a response explaining my efforts to balance everyone’s schedules and apologized for any confusion. I also offered to explain things to Vicky, who Liz made seem was mad at me as well, but was very understanding. Liz suggested we use a group chat or Timetree more effectively, and I agreed to that. However, Liz left me on read afterward.

Later, I discovered Liz and Vicky met up that day anyways with Rena (who was suppose to meet with me, J and C but we still texted throughout the hangout). I feel Liz might have discussed the situation with Rena, and I feel hurt if she hadn't defended me, even while knowing my struggle to balance both friend groups. Liz and Rena meet with other girls in the gc often too as they were in the same hs club together and often make last minute plans together that Jenny (closest to me) and I find about after plans are already set. 

For now, it looks like only Jenny, Vicky, and possibly Rena will meet up tomorrow. I’m worried about losing these friendships before my move and unsure how to smooth things over with Liz.

I feel Liz might have discussed the situation with Rena, and I feel hurt if she hadn't defended me, even while knowing my struggle to balance both friend groups. Liz and Rena meet with other girls in the gc often too as they were in the same hs club together and often make last minute plans together that Jenny (closest to me) and I find about after plans are already set. 

For now, it looks like only Jenny, Vicky, and possibly Rena will meet up tomorrow. I’m worried about losing these friendships before my move and unsure how to smooth things over with Liz. Any advice on how to smooth this over and address my feelings more would be helpful. Most of the girls are closer with Liz because of the club, so I worry if our friendship ends, so will my friendship with the others.",4.0,0.03563300520181656,0,0

72,1erx4fx,AITA for going to a dinner reservation I made w/ a friend instead of my date ,"Hey Reddit. I (22, f) made a dinner reservation for someone (23, f) I matched with and talked to on a dating app as a first outing. She wanted to go immediately after her work, so she didn't have to commute to her place and back for the date. 
However, half an hour before the reservation, she texted me saying she had to do overtime and she wasn't sure if she was gonna make it in time. When I asked how long she was gonna be and if I should try to push the reservation back she didn't respond. She later told me it was because she isn't allowed to be on her phone at work, which is completely fair of course! But I was already in the city close to the dinner place and she didn't respond even when the time of the initial reservation had passed (I did manage to push it back 30 minutes). 
So I asked a friend (23, nb) who lives close by if they could come instead so the reservation wouldn't be wasted. They said yes and we went. 

About half an hour into dinner, so, about an hour past the initially agreed upon time I then got a text from my date, first asking if I was still there and then that she had walked by and seen me sit with someone else already. I messaged her immediately to explain my reasoning, but she hasn't responded since.

I asked my brother if I could be added and just pay him the monthly fee for an added user. It’s in his wife’s name but she agreed and added me as a user.

So this is my first time posting on reddit and I am so sorry if I don't make some things clear as my mind is in mess. As I said we have been close friends but the thing is it may sound bad when I say I have a bad habit of forgetting to reply to messages and return the call on any social media platforms, so over the years we have grown apart. This is important later.

Back to story, after high school I couldn't continue my studies and g went for nursing college. H also didn't continue her studies, we do meet up every now and then. Though it has been few months since we last met. G recently graduated and we were excited about it, h and I planned to attend her graduation together but we didn't know her graduation date. So two months before her graduation I joined a work as a receptionist and was busy, but had informed/requested my colleague that if her graduation fall on any of their off day that we can exchange our off day and they accept.

 Right after her finals she informed or demanded me that I have to attend her graduation as it's her important day which I gladly accepted. I had plan with h to attend her graduation all along. She had called me two days before her graduation I was offline and I didn't see the notification until next day at work, so I forgot to call her back. 

It was not until I saw the post about her graduation from her classmates on fb did I know her graduation has passed. I checked her profile and saw some pictures of graduation,  most of the pictures were  with her classmates and I didn't see h either so I thought she didn't invite anyone, her family were not there either. I congratulated her and asked her why she didn't inform me and she said she called me and I didn't pick up. I didn't know how to reply at that moment, so I just replied oh and left it at that.

Now for the title above, so in my country our govt sends youths to other countries to work as long as your 21 year old and above. It's optional to go or stay in the country. I have applied to every job given on the website so I got an unexpected message for interview on the WhatsApp. I thought it was scam but wanted to see if I could get it. I did the interview and not even two weeks later I got my visa.

I am waiting for flight ticket as it's provided by the company and the flight ticket might come at any moment. I asked both g and h out to talk about it but whenever I ask them out thay are always unavailable, I can inform them through message but I want to inform them face to face and catch up.

Grandma was furious. She told my mom that the half sister is just ""some whore's child"" and not her real sibling and her chance to have siblings died with her mom.

After my great grandma died, great grandpa remarried someone who had a very extensive reputation for going after married and widowered men. My grandma thought the woman was disgusting. It wasn't helped by the fact great grandpa's new wife was also the other woman to one of the parents of grandma's friends. So the hatred already existed. They went on to have a daughter together who grandma never looked at as anything other than the woman's daughter. She saw her dad as a traitor and disgusting for going after someone like his wife. So she never formed any connection with her and she moved out at like 16 in order to get out from under them. Great grandpa's wife's reputation proved to be more than true because even while married to great grandpa there were more and more married or widowered men who were going in and out of the house. At some point several years after grandma moved out, her half sister reached out and asked if she would take her because she wasn't happy at home and grandma said no.

That was the last time they spoke. My mom and her siblings grew up knowing grandma had a half sister she wanted nothing to do with. But sometime during her life mom decided she could be the one to change grandma's mind and she waited until grandma was older and grandpa was gone and she's been living alone for two years now (in the retirement community) and she tracked down the half sister, got that woman's hopes up because she always hoped to have a relationship with my grandma and then showed up at grandma's house with the half sister. It didn't go well. The half sister left heartbroken and my grandma tore my mom a new one. I have never seen my grandma actually angry before. She called my mom a bratty little know it all who thought she could ignore people's wishes and boundaries and she told mom that she couldn't look at her. Mom argued back that grandma has a sister and she should know her before it's too late. Grandma sent me to the store to grab some snacks and by the time I got back grandma told mom she was not welcome back there again.

Mom thought grandma would calm down but she learned a couple of weeks later, when she tried to visit, that she was banned from the community. My mom was horrified.

Well, I(18M(?)) live with my mother(47F) and sisters(17&11) in a what i think is a pretty average flat in Amman, and my aunts help with most expenses and other things since mother doesn't work.

So about six to seven month some ""things"" where brought to my attention about me being abused by my parents which i brushed aside.
And I might have a package deal of mental illness -so, yay?-.
And since I just finished highschool she and my sisters were pushing me to get a job —which I can't since i can't stand up for too long because one of my legs had been broken before and it still causes me so much pain until this day— and i still want to repeat the school year to get higher grades.
So when i told them they said that it's bullshit and it won't help me get a ""real job"" , mind you this bitch made me study every letter in my books when i was younger so i was flabbergasted. And right now i might be in sticky situation because she might kick me out if i don't do as she says.

79,1ervgi9,AITA for telling my sister that she is ruining her child's life with an iPad?,"My sister (36F) and her husband have a 10-year-old kid (who for the purposes of this post is called ""Jimothy"") who me and my husband sometimes babysit on the weekends and on some days I take him to school. As of about a year ago, we started to notice that Jimothy was beginning to develop an American accent. We are Australian. Small kids have phases, and so I didn't want to make it ""a thing"".

Over the next few months, the accent got thicker and Jimothy became more irritable. Me and my husband brought this up with my sister, who said that Jimothy wasn't very grumpy when with her. He then started losing interest in almost all activities that he used to enjoy. Again, this was a concern for me. Every weekend it got worse. He would complain of being bored but when we offered an exhaustive list of all the things we could do with him, he said no to every single one. 

The school year for 2024 started, and on the weekend after that Jimothy told us that his teacher and a few classmates had asked him how long he'd been in the US before moving to Australia. At this point his American accent was indistinguishable from a General American accent. My husband and I were really wondering what was happening. 

Then, it was Jimothy's birthday party. His family was invited, including me, and so were all his friends. This was the moment that made me realise to some extent what was going on. He was on an iPad, scrolling some kind of short-form content that I did not recognise. His friends wanted to play with him, and he just did not notice they were there. People were giving him presents, and he acted like he was inconvenienced for having to turn the iPad off. Never before had any of my nieces or nephews reacted like this upon me giving them money and delicious treats. 

I told my sister that something was going on, and that Jimothy is obviously not in a good way. She seemed very offended that I was ""questioning her parenting choices"" as she put it, and she decided that me and my husband babysitting Jimothy had to stop.

The next time I saw Jimothy was very recently, at my niece's birthday party (different parents). Jimothy was completely glued to the iPad. He was noticeably skinnier, which I suspect was because he was forgetting to eat in favour of iPad time. And when anyone went over to talk to him, he would almost instinctively push the screen towards his body so nobody could see. 

I had to talk to my sister and her husband. I told them what I thought, that a year ago Jimothy was an energetic child who got along really well with everyone, and now he's reclusive and it's obvious from just looking at him that he's skipping meals. My sister denied any changes in Jimothy's behaviour, but her husband did admit that I was right to some extent, and Jimothy's friends had stopped trying to hang out with him because he said no 100% of the time. I told my sister she was wrecking Jimothy's life by continuing to let this iPad stuff happen.

One night at dinner, me (14) and my aunts (41 F and 32 F) were discussing random topics after we finished our nightly phone call to my mother and grandmother, which were separate phone calls, and the topic finally shifted to behaviors we had issues with. It started with my mother (39 F), which I tried to shut down because my aunt’s notoriously berate and belittle my mother ever since they were kids. I decided to speak up about my grandmother’s behavior. I told them about how uncomfortable I felt every time grandma brings up my weight and eating habits, and my aunt Mandy agreed but said “she doesn’t mean much by it”, to which I then added how awkward and disgusting it felt to have her come back from her trip to Mexico the same week I broke my Femur bone. 

The break happened back in February, and I spent Valentine’s Day high and in the hospital after surgery. I had returned home and slept terribly on the couch, high and unable to move for a few days before finally able to move into my bed. The same day I finally could lay in my bed, my grandma stops by and yaps about how lovely her trip to Mexico was. Me and my mother had exchanged looks, the room obviously tense and uncomfortable. I was high on pain meds but I could still make sense of the situation and I was angry that this woman not only ranted about how fun her trip was while I was in the literal worst week I’d ever had, and then proceed to ask if she could borrow my walker that I was using when I was done with it.

I explained all this to my aunts and they simply responded with, “Oh she was only trying to distract you from your pain because she cares about you!” To which I scoffed, earning questions. Would they appreciate hearing about freaking iguanas after breaking the biggest bone in their body at fourteen? I certainly did not.

87,1eru4km,AITA for asking my husband to help me ,"My husband (35M), let’s call him Joe works basically whole day almost every day, because he lost his job 5 months ago and couldn’t find a new one ever since, even thou he’s trying very hard.  We have a 1 year old son, let’s call him Mark and Joe’s great with him and this boy is obsessed with his father.
I (31F) am a stay-at-home mom. We’re immigrants in Canada and waiting on the decision of our papers, but we have a temporary work permit.
It’s been very hard on the both of us since we don’t have any family here to help, and Mark is super clingy, makes my life very difficult, barely can get anything done. There are good days, but it’s a lot of effort and sometimes it’s just really hard. 

The last couple of days I had to go travel around in the city with Mark, so I couldn’t clean. My husband was amazing yesterday and cleaned the dishes, so I could clean the kitchen and cook today. Even though I went out to the store around 5 pm, but since we’re trying to save money I had to go on foot with my baby to multiple stores, and it took us for soo long that I only could start cooking around 9pm. I was almost done when my son had a huge accident 🤣 and his diaper came off on our bed when he peed and well…put a little something in his pants. I run to help and clean him so I had to stop cooking. Of course I called my husband right away half crying half laughing to tell him and he told me to don’t worry he’ll come home soon. 
So I cleaned Mark and continued cooking so Joe can eat when he’s finally home. I finished with the meat just when he arrived but he brought me potatoes from the store when he was before because it was on sale, so I had to quickly make that too, and I left my son with his father, so I can be quicker.

But Joe wanted to study and didn’t plan to help me with anything. So I voiced it and asked him to help me because I saw Mark being super tired, I asked him to out his son down to sleep, or help me with the potatoes or with the bed so we can actually go to sleep eventually. But he said no first then he said he will out our son to sleep somewhere else (we cosleep). I got frustrated and angry, and I asked him why did he said that he’ll help me if he didn’t plan to. Then h said that he’s tired from work and he doesn’t want to do anything else but study and sleep. And he threw at my face that he’s sure that my friend doesn’t cook this late, I threw at him yeah because her husband does help her with their daughter even after a long workday.
We ended up having a huge fight and I said to him that this is what’s like to be a parent, to have a family. No matter how tired you are from work, you have other responsibilities. I haven’t taken a break all day either, and it’s super draining to be with a one year old whole day.
I understand that he’s exhausted and that’s why I’m always letting him chill after he arrives home. But it was just one of those days.

So am I the ass*ole?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-14,"AITA for asking my husband to help me  My husband (35M), let’s call him Joe works basically whole day almost every day, because he lost his job 5 months ago and couldn’t find a new one ever since, even thou he’s trying very hard.  We have a 1 year old son, let’s call him Mark and Joe’s great with him and this boy is obsessed with his father.
I (31F) am a stay-at-home mom. We’re immigrants in Canada and waiting on the decision of our papers, but we have a temporary work permit.
It’s been very hard on the both of us since we don’t have any family here to help, and Mark is super clingy, makes my life very difficult, barely can get anything done. There are good days, but it’s a lot of effort and sometimes it’s just really hard. 

The last couple of days I had to go travel around in the city with Mark, so I couldn’t clean. My husband was amazing yesterday and cleaned the dishes, so I could clean the kitchen and cook today. Even though I went out to the store around 5 pm, but since we’re trying to save money I had to go on foot with my baby to multiple stores, and it took us for soo long that I only could start cooking around 9pm. I was almost done when my son had a huge accident 🤣 and his diaper came off on our bed when he peed and well…put a little something in his pants. I run to help and clean him so I had to stop cooking. Of course I called my husband right away half crying half laughing to tell him and he told me to don’t worry he’ll come home soon.

88,1ertqbv,AITA for home wrecking??,"i know the title seems bunk af but hear me out

i had three friends i was friends with for almost 5 years at the time; one of them i started dating (we'll call her A) and the other friend (who we'll call J) was her older brother. the other friend (who we'll call D) was my absolute bestie, i waited for him to get out of jail, he lived with me and vice versa.. basically me and D went through some tough shit together. well fast forward me and A were going through a rough patch and unfortunately i had to break things off to keep heat off of us. mind you D knows everything thats going on between me and A.. fully aware, right? well i tried making plans with him and whatnot and he's just been ducking from me. one day he calls me.. blowing up my phone.. i answered and the first thing he says is ""i did something..""

i reply with what did you do? im expecting him to say im going back to jail, thats nothing new to me. what was however was definitely new to me.

what came out of his mouth next was 
""im in love with your ex..""

my blood never boiled faster. ive been angry before but ive never been seething with anger before. i felt like a cartoon character getting red hot. i couldn't believe my ears.. i immediately knew who he was talking about..

i told him if you decide to get with her and break brocode im actually cutting you off with a side of ass whooping. naturally D didn't heed my warning.

i don't see him for 3 months.. until one day im walking to my friends house to pick up some trees. i notice this car driving past me a few times but i dont pay any mind to it. right when i get to my friends lawn D jumps out and yells at me.

""why you been ducking me? where you been?""

i walk everywhere and everyone always see me everywhere. i am not a hard person to miss.

i say this to him verbatim like im telling you guys. 

we eventually run up on each other and i can smell the alcohol on him.. it fcking reeks. 
im putting belt to ass severely and J sees this. J hops out of the car and proceeds to jump me. this guy is fat as fuck bro.. he's holding me down while D punches me. 

i find it so crazy they felt the need to jump to woman.
the next night they're creeping around my house for round two. what they dont know is im already 109 steps ahead of them.

i call another friend (who we will call E) and i tell her everything i just listed above. she tells me to wait 30 minutes and she'll concoct a plan.. short story we had fat man(J) jumped just like how he did me and i finished my ones with D.

the story doesnt end here that is just a smidge of context.

D also thinks i banged his ex. so just remember this..

- he got with my ex who im very much still in love with (shut up ik its stupid) 
- he jumped me
- he's bumming in my exs house because J and D are secretly homo for each other 

months later (sometime in may 2024) i see A's little sister at a festival. we will call her S. i greet S, she never did anything wrong to me.. i let curiosity get the best of me and i ask about A and D. she tells me they arent doing very well. 

it felt like a lightbulb went off above my head. i took what she said with a grain of salt.. im not sure how long i waited to text A but it was a while since that conversation with S.

i ask A how was she doing and if she was doing alright. rightfully she was skeptical but she caved. i had no intentions of doing anything other than talking to her through text.

however that didn't last long. that same week we hung out and i told her the love i have for her never left. i might be dumb but i believed her when she said the same.. shut up and let me live in bliss. 

i forgot to mention that after D jumped me: he said that A will never love me as much as him and she'll always chose peener over veener and whatever. 

well D eventually found out A was and i have been hanging out and talking. and i could tell it was really eating at his soul because like i mentioned earlier:

-he thinks i banged his ex 
-he got his ass beat twice in two nights 
 
and then he found out the mf who has been hanging with ""his girl"" from 12am-6am was me.

i plan on leaving the state with A in a few months because of uh.. bliss but thanks for reading..

91,1erth1o,AITA for cutting of my father ,"
My parents divorced when i was 2. My mom left my dad for a woman. My mother was white, mostly irish and a bit french. My father, an irish puerto rican. Both coming from extremely catholic families. My mother was bisexual, and my father was homophobic. My father would leave my mother voicemails when i was in elementary school about how she was a bad mother, and how her and her girlfriend would brainwash me into a lesbian. 

As i got older, my visits with my dad became less exciting. I never really wanted to go. I remember crying to my mom and saying i would want to stay with her instead of going to my dads almost every weekend he had me. I remember having a conversation with my mother about how if anything were to happen to her, what would happen to me. She told me she would prefer i live with my brothers who were both 10+ years older than me. 

When i was 13, my first week of highschool a drunk driver hit my mother head on and she died on impact. At my mothers funeral my dad had come. I had said hello but i was more focused on my cousins. I had not fully processed or understood what the loss of my mother meant. It was also an open casket i didn’t want to stay in that room for the entire service looking at my mother. He eventually pulled me aside and said i wasn’t making him feel welcomed and i was making him feel uncomfortable. He began to yell at me and said “ well i guess this means you’re living with me now right” . But that’s not what my mother wanted and it’s not what i wanted. My brothers and my dad had gone to court and my brothers got custody of me. 

Shortly after my dad had called me one day and left me a voice mail saying “ i give up on being your father” . I didn’t hear from him for 6 years after that. When i was 18, i reached out to him. He was my last living parent and i wanted to make amends and try and salvage our relationship. I’ve had to grow up without a mother and now i’m growing up without a father. We talked here and there for a bit and i visited him a few times. But our relationship had no depth to it. 

I am now 25 and on father’s day i had messaged him and wished him a happy father’s day. He responded thanks. The next day he starts blowing up my phone saying how im ungrateful and how im selfish for not wishing him a happy father’s day. Im pretty sure he was drunk, but he said some really hurtful things. He told me to never ask him for anything again, when i have never asked him for one damn thing. Everything i have is because of me. It broke my heart all over again. At this point i’m just over trying to mend things. The effort i’m putting into mending our relationship is taking more of a toll on me. I’ve grew up without a father and i’ve made it this far. I’m used to it. If i cut him off , i’ll be okay. Does this make me an asshole? He’s so quick to get rid of me. So why do i feel bad ?

fast forward to late june she says she can’t take care of them anymore and i asked her for some time to find new arrangements for them. (they’re a bonded pair and cannot be separated). i left a good paying job and had to go part time somewhere else and financially was struggling until recently. the cats needed to be updated on vaccines before going to their new temp home and i just didn’t have the money to do both in one go. i got one vaccinated and was waiting until i got paid again to vaccinate the other. 

her bf has now messaged me saying he’s going to vaccinate my one cat and then give them to a shelter and is telling me i’m walking all over my friend. that he’s not threatening or harassing me. he’s saying it’s not their responsibility to take care of other people’s animals (even though that was the entire agreement from the beginning). he’s talking about her being evicted bc of the cats even though the landlord knows that she’s has them and i made sure to communicate that with him before i moved out of the building.

AITA....
There's so much snowballing from this event, and I'm meant to be normal without real conversations about this trauma. No real understanding of why I'm hurt, or why I can't move forward. My reactions are the main focus for him, it's unacceptable in his eyes, but I seem to have him understand that my hurt is going to keep getting more and more if it's not resolved, like a snowball, I don't know how else to explain this.

Maybe it's too complex. 
AITA?

94,1ert6w6,AITA for becoming close with my friend’s ex bf after they broke up?,"I’m currently in high school and this happened last year. I, Elsie, (15F) had a guy best friend, Ethan (16M) that both me and my best friend, Abby, (16F) were extremely close with since the 7th grade. Our friendship between him has always been on and off, but has been especially close as of late since him and his girlfriend, Tonya (15F) are broken up. The year before Ethan and Tonya had gotten together, Ethan was talking to one of my other friends and ended on bad terms because of him which caused my falling out with him. This led to him and Tonya becoming closer and the following school year even closer until they eventually started dating. I had kept my boundaries with him while they were dating, but towards the end of their relationship, he started hanging out with Abby and I again. Tonya didn’t seem to have a big issue with it on the outside, but through a friend I heard she did. 

For more backstory, Tonya is an incredibly social and friendly person, but people would say too friendly and things like “How does Ethan let that happen and not do anything”. From my personal knowledge of Ethan and his personality, he doesn’t like the fact that she would talk to a lot of guys, but would let it slide. Moving on from that, following their breakup, him, Abby and I began hanging out a lot and since I am still friends with Tonya she had knowledge of this and seen it too. Seeing both sides I know what they think of one another and how they feel still, but choose to remain silent.

Now starting off the new school year, Tonya sits with us and multiple other friends at lunch. Abby, Ethan, and I don’t sit around much but he comes to the table often to talk to us around her and she acts very casual about it or quiet even. I still have guilty feelings of becoming close with him so soon after the breakup and don’t know what to do about it because the tension is there when me, Abby, Ethan and Tonya are around.

96,1ert4tp,AITA my partner “jokes” about my weight even after he promised he would stop,"My partner has made jokes about my weight several times in our relationship. A lot of the time I didn’t take them personally, but it reached a point where I asked him to stop because they were honestly never funny and in the end left me feeling anxious and confused about my weight.

In the past, I asked him to please never joke about weight again, and he promised me he wouldn’t. He has already broken that agreement several times since and constantly brings up his poor memory (he suffers with severe ptsd and depression and states that this is why he has poor memory).  

Although I’m considered slim/thin, I haven’t felt confident in my physique for a while. I’ve always either felt too thin or chubby (my weight fluctuates). Recently, I’ve been on some weight due to depression. Although it’s not much of a difference from before, I’ve started to notice it because my clothes have become much tighter and don’t feel as comfortably as before. I also feel that with the level of stress I’ve been experiencing my face has become rounder/chubbier. I mentioned this to him in the car and he made a joke about me being a Rollie Pollie. That didn’t make me feel good and he immediately recognized that I was hurt because my energy shifted. 

Moving forward to today, I was in the bathroom looking at my face in the mirror and he walked by and said “don’t worry Rollie pollie faces are in now, haven’t you heard?” I immediately got emotional. He came over to me and tried hugging me and told me it was a joke. I didn’t find it funny, and went into the room to lie down. He came over to me, and told me again it was just a joke and that he doesn’t feel like he can say anything around because has to watch what he says. He then went on a whole rant about how if he wanted to be a comedian he would have to tell people, “oh I can’t joke right now, my partner is here”. I told him his jokes weren’t funny and they were actually mean and hurt me. He continued to go on and on about how he can’t handle my sensitivity or insecurities and that it was just a joke. 

Due to today interaction, I’m now questioning if I need to toughen up and allow for these jokes to continue or if I’m valid for how I feel. Please let me know. I’m not looking for reassurance - just honesty so that I can do some reflecting.

97,1ersiqc,AITA for not inviting my sister to my wedding because of her attitude?,"I (24F) have an older sister (27F) with whom I don't get along. We have different moms and the same dad but she spent most of her childhood with my mom and siblings and we used to be best friends. As we got older I realized that she grew colder and more distant to me and would often make rude comments about my body and mannerism. These remarks were always random and uncalled for and it got to the point where she got me crying so my dad got angry at her and since then she barely talked to me. This was 10 years ago.

Her mom who used to talk to me became very bitter towards me (Even before my sister made me cry) and I was deeply hurt because she was an adult and someone I used to look up to. Later on, I found out that she hated my mom for 'stealing' my dad even though she and him were separated a year before my parents met. This information broke my heart because I realized that this woman despised me for something that happened before I was born.

Two years ago my sister had her son and she didn't tell my dad and me she was pregnant until she was 8 months along. When she had the baby she wouldn't take our calls so we figured she needed space; I was even planning on seeing her when the baby was older but she didn't contact us for 7 months. Then I found out that she visited her friend who lived down the street from us to show them the baby, stayed the night then went home without even stopping by.

I didn't meet my nephew until his 2nd birthday.

A few months later her mother died from an illness and I went halfway across the country with my brother to show support to her but she and her side of the family gave us such a cold shoulder while we were there that my brother ended up leaving early. Since that day I decided to keep my distance from her since she doesn't want me around and blames me for things beyond my control.

Fast forward to now, I got engaged to the most amazing man in the universe (M26) and we are currently planning our wedding. When the topic of guests came up we decided that we wanted 50 guests in total. 25 from his side and 25 from mine. When my mom looked at the list of people for my side she asked why my sister's name was not included. I told her that we were limiting the number of guests because of financial reasons and we both preferred a small wedding. She said that It would look bad if I didn't invite her but I said no and stood my ground.

I want my wedding day to be the happiest day of my life and I don't want someone there who makes me miserable.

99,1ers2we,AITA for telling my customers to eat at the restaurant next door,"I’m a 33-year-old female bartender who has been working in the industry for over a decade. I started bartending when I was 21 and have kept it up alongside my 9-5 job because I genuinely enjoy serving people. Over the years, I’ve gotten pretty damn good at it, too. Lately, I’ve been transitioning out of the late-night bar scene and have started working at a family restaurant in a mall to slowly ease into retirement from bartending.

Tonight, I had a family of three come in—mom, dad, and their teenage son. Our restaurant takes food allergies extremely seriously; we even have a computer system that can generate custom menus based on dietary restrictions. When I went to take their order, they informed me that their son has a severe peanut and tree nut allergy. I told them I could definitely bring them the matrix to see what he could safely eat. However, since I’ve seen this kind of allergy many times before, I knew off the top of my head that our menu would offer very limited options for him. I suggested that they might want to consider the restaurant next door instead, where I knew there would be more choices that could accommodate his allergy. I also reassured them that they could, of course, order whatever they liked, but my main concern was ensuring they had a safe and enjoyable dining experience.

Usually, when I bring up this suggestion, customers appreciate the honesty and even tip me for looking out for them. But not this time. The father was furious. He claimed to be in the industry himself and berated me for suggesting they go to another restaurant, especially since, according to him, his son had been looking forward to our food all week (even though it was only Tuesday). I apologized and tried to explain that my priority was their satisfaction and that I wanted to make sure they had the best dining experience possible, given the limitations of his son’s allergy. But the father wasn’t having it.

They asked for a new server, requested to be moved out of my section, and even demanded to speak with a manager. They complained about my “appalling behavior” and insisted on getting the contact information for our owner so they could file a complaint against me. Throughout the rest of their meal, they continued to bad-mouth me to the server who took over their table.

I was pretty upset for the remainder of my shift because I took the situation personally. Service 101: guest satisfaction is the most important part of service. If a customer can’t eat here safely, they’re going to have a bad experience no matter how hard I try, and that’s not good for anyone involved. So yes, in retrospect, I didn’t put the restaurant first—I put the customer’s satisfaction and safety first. But does that make me the asshole?

End of shift update: The other server told me the teenage son didn’t eat anything. He just sat there watching his parents eat, and then afterward, they went to the restaurant I originally suggested to get him food. They even told the other server that they plan to take a photo of the receipt from that restaurant and include it in the complaint email to my owner... To what end, I have no idea. The silver lining? They tipped the other server 25% for “taking such good care of them.”

I still stand by the way I handled the situation. I would do the same for any other customer in a similar scenario.

102,1errbo3,AITA for being mad that my parents didn’t give me their old Apple Watch?,"Okay, so I know this sounds like I’m a spoiled kid and/or I’m worried about something little, but just hear me out first, then judge me if I’m in the wrong.

So, about a year ago, my dad gives me (M, 14) his old Samsung watch. At first, I’m real happy about it. I love the watch, I still have it today. It works perfect. I wasn’t worried about getting an Apple Watch until my dad brought the topic up a couple months ago. 

In this conversation, my twin sister explicitly explains that she thinks that the watch idea is boring and unnecessary. Me wanting an upgrade (again, nothing wrong with it, but if you can get an upgrade then why wouldn’t you), I instantly said I wanted one, basically letting it be known that I wanted one. I’m not really sure what happened, but we ended up not getting them. 

I asked several times after, but got the usual “we’ll see” or “not right now”. To say that my parents knew I wanted an Apple Watch would be an understatement.

I was not mad at that point. I mean yeah I was upset that I didn’t get an upgrade but it was whatever at that point.

Fast forward to like 20-30 mins ago, I hear my mom say: “we might have to wait for dad to do this”. Me wanting to help my mom, I went to her and tried to help. I saw she had an Apple Watch in her hand. I asked if we got new Apple Watches. My mom says that my sister is just going to use her old one. I ask why. We debate it for a little before I finally leave. 

When I tell my mom goodnight, she tells me that she didn’t know I would be upset, and that my sister felt “left out”. She also says the watch is “girly” (even though it wasn’t, and even if it was, you can customize it). I bring up the conversation from a couple months ago, and my mom says she changed her mind.

I guess my dad overhears our conversation and calls me and my mom to their room. He basically gives me this nonsense lecture about “being happy for others” and “not everything is about you”.

My whole reasoning is that if my parents knew that I wanted the watch, then why wouldn’t I be the top priority if there’s one not being used? Why does my sister just get to decide “I want one now” and she gets the better watch than me?

I didn’t say this to my parents because at that point I didn’t feel like arguing.
",Asshole,2024-08-14,"AITA for being mad that my parents didn’t give me their old Apple Watch? Okay, so I know this sounds like I’m a spoiled kid and/or I’m worried about something little, but just hear me out first, then judge me if I’m in the wrong.

So, about a year ago, my dad gives me (M, 14) his old Samsung watch. At first, I’m real happy about it. I love the watch, I still have it today. It works perfect. I wasn’t worried about getting an Apple Watch until my dad brought the topic up a couple months ago. 

In this conversation, my twin sister explicitly explains that she thinks that the watch idea is boring and unnecessary. Me wanting an upgrade (again, nothing wrong with it, but if you can get an upgrade then why wouldn’t you), I instantly said I wanted one, basically letting it be known that I wanted one. I’m not really sure what happened, but we ended up not getting them. 

I asked several times after, but got the usual “we’ll see” or “not right now”. To say that my parents knew I wanted an Apple Watch would be an understatement.

I was not mad at that point. I mean yeah I was upset that I didn’t get an upgrade but it was whatever at that point.

Fast forward to like 20-30 mins ago, I hear my mom say: “we might have to wait for dad to do this”. Me wanting to help my mom, I went to her and tried to help. I saw she had an Apple Watch in her hand. I asked if we got new Apple Watches. My mom says that my sister is just going to use her old one. I ask why. We debate it for a little before I finally leave. 

When I tell my mom goodnight, she tells me that she didn’t know I would be upset, and that my sister felt “left out”. She also says the watch is “girly” (even though it wasn’t, and even if it was, you can customize it). I bring up the conversation from a couple months ago, and my mom says she changed her mind.

103,1erqvht,AITA for wanting my SO to access my phone discreetly?,"I (20M) have been with my girlfriend (19F) for around 8 months. We met on a dating app and I was absolutely committed to her immediately. For context, I’ve had multiple relationships in the past, whereas her first relationship is with me, so understandably she was wary of my past and I’m understanding whenever she has her doubts.

We’re transparent with each other, so we have access to each other’s phones and computers. She also follows my private Instagram account, which contains posts a typical lost teenage boy would post about (namely girls). I haven’t posted on it for two years now, but that’s besides the point. I’m not the most comfortable when it comes to anything about my past, not just my relationships, in the sense that I feel embarrassed when anyone snoops through my photo album or reads my past conversations when I’m present.

Given this, we’ve had a fight in the past regarding a female friend who replied to a story I posted of my cat. My girlfriend was overseas at the time (we live together) and we had been together for 2 months at that point. I seldom communicated with this girl, and when I did, they were very short, almost uninterested messages. At the time, I didn’t tell my girlfriend I was conversing with this person, as I felt it was like talking to any other of my friends and as such unnecessary to bring up. I didn’t act in any way that would make be unfaithful either, so I saw no problem with it. She finds out about this person later down the line after we go through my phone together and becomes upset I didn’t tell her. Even at this time, I felt as though I was undeserving to be labeled a cheater, but I understood that the lack of transparency made it seem otherwise and relentlessly apologised. She didn’t request this, but I unfollowed every female follower who followed me on Instagram to show that an incident like this would never happen again, and my commitment to doing so. I wasn’t trying to do this for forgiveness, but rather as a way to show that I’m committed to righting my wrongs.

Fast forward to today, she once again asks to go through my phone. She scrolls through my aforementioned private account until she finds a post about a K-pop idol I liked at the time, and playfully mocked me about the caption. I wasn’t pressed or anything at all, but did feel a bit embarrassed. I told her (like I had done many times in the past) that I was uncomfortable with her going through my account in front of me, completely putting aside the playful mockery.

She begins to get upset that I’m hiding something. This completely baffles me; we live in the same house and have access to each other’s devices. I tell her that if she thinks that way then she can go through my phone when I’m sleeping, or in another room. She doesn’t respond and instead continues to cry about how I’m hiding something. She’s also dismissive of any comforting attempts.

I understand that, given the past incident, she is less trusting of me. I’m just very confused as to what I should’ve done here.

So far he has checked in at awkward, unannounced times just to say he will get the invoice to us (about 4x) with no invoice.

Today, the fence company completed our side of the fence, I left our gate unlocked so the crew could come and go and complete the fence. At 7pm or so they finished up and left. At 8:30pm or so I went out to lock the gate. We use the gate lock due to kids, private pool, and my husband works nights-so security. At 8:45pm neighbor knocks on our front door, loudly.

He was going to start staining! We specifically said the to neighbor we didn’t want stain on our side or split the additional cost of staining.

I was pretty upset that he would try to take advantage of us. But after the 8:45pm knock I’m just thankful this is over.

My sons birthday is September 5, he will be 3 years old.

 This evening she made a comment to my mom about something like “don’t you think you shouldn’t be drinking the day I’m giving birth and be sober” or something along those lines. I told her that she could realistically have the baby anytime night or day from 37 weeks on out. I don’t see it as a big deal but advice before carrying on would be nice.

So I booked the hotel for two. Costing about £300, I showed him a printed receipt. So he owed £150 for his half. Time of the event comes round. As we were travelling down, I mentioed it, I knew he had enough. He had like £500 his parents had given him to spend at the event. He didn't pay.

We get to the hotel reception, the woman behind the desk says, ""\[My name\] and you have a booking for two.""

I replied, ""Just a booking for one, he's not with me.""

He started to protest, I replied to the receptionist, ""We did travel down together, but I booked the room in my name expecting him to pay half, he hasn't, so I can only assume he has made his own accomodation arrangements.""

He offered to pay when we get home.

I told him that if he pays me when we get home I'll book a hotel for him when we get home. Then pointed out that his half would be £150, if he paid me he'd still have plenty leftover for the event.

He didn't want to so I turned to the receptionist, ""He's not with me, don't give him a key to the room.""

He ended up going home that day after spending a few hours(and most of his £500, he needed to get his parents to wire money for a train back) on the first day of the event. His parents were pissed when I got back. My parents, while understanding why I did, said that I shouldn't have done what I did.

So I booked the hotel for two. Costing about £300, I showed him a printed receipt. So he owed £150 for his half. Time of the event comes round. As we were travelling down, I mentioed it, I knew he had enough. He had like £500 his parents had given him to spend at the event. He didn't pay.

We get to the hotel reception, the woman behind the desk says, ""\[My name\] and you have a booking for two.""

I replied, ""Just a booking for one, he's not with me.""

He started to protest, I replied to the receptionist, ""We did travel down together, but I booked the room in my name expecting him to pay half, he hasn't, so I can only assume he has made his own accomodation arrangements.""

My son (15m) was taken to the beach club of his bff (15m) while there his bff took his glasses off and placed them in the middle of a float. Safest place for them by the water. My son decided he wanted to use the float and placed the glasses near some stairs. Somehow the glasses fall into the water and are lost forever. My son comes home and in passing mentioned what happened, to which I through the story was done. Today… now a few days later I receive a text saying, “hi, I had spoke to your son about this and hadn’t heard from you that’s why I’m reaching out. But because your son was involved in losing the glasses ( because he moved them off the float to use it) and they’re $500, anything you could contribute would be greatly appreciated.” With boys this age it’s hard to get the whole truth but here’s my question, am I the a-hole for only sending $50? Money is tight for everyone but this family is well established with both parents having good jobs, nice cars and the ability to pay for a private beach club. My husband and I both work very hard for all we have and would never buy ourselves a pair of $500 glasses let alone my 15y.o!

116,1eroy0o,AITA for cussing my boyfriend out about communication?,"Hey everyone, I need some outside perspectives on a situation that happened recently.

So, my boyfriend (27M) and I (24F) have been dating for about 3 years, and generally, things have been good. However, we got into a pretty big argument a few days ago that has left me questioning if I was in the wrong.

Here's what happened: Over the past few weeks, I’ve been feeling unheard by my boyfriend. We've had communication issues before, especially early in our relationship, but I thought we had made real progress and things were improving. Recently, though, it feels like we’re slipping back into old habits.

I started to notice that whenever I tried to express how I was feeling, especially when I felt like my concerns weren’t being acknowledged, he wouldn’t take me seriously. It was as if he thought I was joking or being overly sensitive, and he’d just brush it off without really engaging in the conversation.

This happened multiple times—I’d bring up how I was feeling, and he’d just give me the same dismissive response. It was really starting to get to me because I felt like I wasn’t being respected or valued in the relationship. I’m not one to keep quiet when something is bothering me, so I decided to try talking to him about it again.

One morning, right before he was about to leave for work, I brought it up again, hoping that maybe a more serious conversation would get through to him. But instead of listening or trying to understand where I was coming from, he gave me a really cold, almost indifferent response. It hurt, and I didn’t know how to react in the moment, so we ended up not talking for a week.

That silence wasn’t what I wanted at all—I just wanted us to communicate better and work through this. But instead, it felt like he was ignoring the issue altogether, which only made me more frustrated.

So, after the week was over, I ended up sending a very long message to him, explaining that I hated his response to me and that I needed someone who is going to show up when it mattered no matter how little it feels to the next person. (I used some pretty strong language and said some explicit things because I was really hurt and frustrated at that point.)

To be clear, I do care about him a lot, but I felt like I wasn’t being heard or respected during the argument. At the same time, I know that cussing someone out isn’t the best way to handle conflict, and I’m worried that I may have really hurt him, and nobody is really seeing my side, saying I should've given him more time to respond but I felt like a week was long enough. 

So, AITA for cussing him out? Should I apologize, or was I justified given the circumstances?

Only to find out later that he did the same thing to someone else a couple years earlier. My son knows he has a brother out there because I've been looking for 20 years. He's wanted to meet him. 

With limited information, about a year ago, I most likely found Leon's brother Don (M 25) on social media. My cousin Sandy (F 55) & I have found missing family members in the past, so I obviously let her know.

Because I'm disabled & my schedule is loaded, Sandy decided to help. To try contact Don before we told Leon as we didn't want him heartbroken if it wasn't his brother.

Cousins story after a month of trying to contact Don...It's his brother, but my cousin said he's shy and hates bio dad. I told Leon & he's so excited for the connection. Don wants to meet Leon but not if he's involved in bio dad's life. Bio dad & I have been no contact almost from the beginning. But Don's not ""ready"" to meet up yet. Maybe when he comes to town as he's moved out of state.

I found bio dad's wife when Leon was 18 & my son had no interest. So I thought this was a no brainer. Don will want to meet up! Right?

Today I get this very uneasy feeling & decide look up Don again. He is linked/ friends... whatever with cousin. OK so then I look up bio dad's wife. She's connected with Don. Why? If he hates bio dad so much, why connect with his wife. I smell something rotten!

Cousin has a history of lying 🤥, being controlling & being embarrassed of family members for whatever vain reasons. I'm feeling like she's keeping these brothers apart. Did I mention cousin is a attention seeker?

I'm mad that this has gone on for so long. My son is away taking care of something personal, but as soon as he's home I'm giving him his brother's info. Would I be an AH for not contacting cousin first to get the ""truth""? Cousin & I are minimal contact & I don't feel like dealing with shenanigans. ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-14,"AITA if I give my son his brothers contact info.  I (F 45) have a son we'll call Leon (M 22). His father ghosted me shortly after we discovered I was pregnant. Only to find out later that he did the same thing to someone else a couple years earlier. My son knows he has a brother out there because I've been looking for 20 years. He's wanted to meet him. 

With limited information, about a year ago, I most likely found Leon's brother Don (M 25) on social media. My cousin Sandy (F 55) & I have found missing family members in the past, so I obviously let her know.

Because I'm disabled & my schedule is loaded, Sandy decided to help. To try contact Don before we told Leon as we didn't want him heartbroken if it wasn't his brother.

Cousins story after a month of trying to contact Don...It's his brother, but my cousin said he's shy and hates bio dad. I told Leon & he's so excited for the connection. Don wants to meet Leon but not if he's involved in bio dad's life. Bio dad & I have been no contact almost from the beginning. But Don's not ""ready"" to meet up yet.

123,1ernqgu,AITA for not waking up to my alarm?,"Waking up to alarms has always been a problem for me. One day last year my mom gave me an ultimatum. You rather wake up to school are we’re going to transfer you to a worse school that’s closer. So this year I wanted to make sure I set my alarms. I have one alarm 10 minutes before I wake up because I naturally turn my alarm off and head right back to sleep, so setting this alarm wakes me up before my main alarm. 

Well this morning I set an alarm for 5:45 than my main one at 6:00. I was up but my parents “woke me up”. I came back home later and my parents were mad at me for having that alarm on. But if I didn’t have it on I wouldn’t have waken up, proven by the other times I’ve slept in. 

We’ve made an agreement to set it at 5:55 and 6:00 but I don’t wake up at 6 there will be consequences. I’m good with this but I don’t believe that the way I set my alarm is abnormal. She stated that I’m the only person she’s ever seen do this and is tired of waking up to it. 

So AITA for setting a prior alarm to wake me up, even if it wakes her up?",Asshole,2024-08-14,"AITA for not waking up to my alarm? Waking up to alarms has always been a problem for me.

124,1ernplu,"WIBTA for buying/upgrading a new iPhone, even if my dad disproves since it is more costly than fixing the parts of my old iPhone?","Throwaway account.

Today, mom and I went to the Apple Store to see what was wrong with my iPhone 11. A technician there told me that its battery was degraded and past warranty. Also, the rear lens of the camera was moved out of place, which caused parts of the camera to stop working.

We discussed possible solutions and came up with 2 different options:

1. The iPhone 11 will be fixed by a technician at the Apple Store by having both the camera lens and battery parts replaced for about $190 + tax. The parts will only be covered under warranty for 90 days.

2. I can upgrade my phone to a new iPhone 14, which is way more expensive and costs between $700-$800.

I discussed the options with my dad. He wants me to get my iPhone 11 fixed and the parts replaced instead of allowing me to buy a new/upgraded iPhone 14, which is better quality.

So, WIBTA if I went against my dad's wishes and upgraded my phone to a new iPhone 14 instead of fixing my old iPhone 11?

125,1ernf3h,AITA for having reservations about buying a house with my financially irresponsible partner?,"Have been dating for a couple of years post my divorce from ex-partner. I love my girlfriend and we have had some discussions about marriage, buying a house, business etc together. At the start of the relationship these were all common goals, but over the past 12 months or so I have had some reservations. I am trying to keep the emotions out of my thought process, but I always feel like I am being an AH.

I am financially stable, have good savings, live within my means and plan to buy another house in the future (I am currently renting as I lost everything in the forementioned divorce settlement.) I am comfortable living by myself. I feel my partner is not as financially responsible as me, and this causes me concern. She also rents, but has absolutely no savings, lives off her small income from her business, as well as government assistance. She owns no assets, does not own a car, and has no savings. I have tried many times to help her with finances, helping her with saving, improving cash flow in business, taking her to a financial advisor, taking her to a business mentor, structuring her business. She told me her sister is going to help her get a house by going guarantor for the loan. She has 3 kids that live with her, and only one of the fathers are in their lives, paying child-support etc.

In the past I have built 2 houses with ex-partners, and I provided both the deposits, and most of the repayments. I feel insecure about doing this with my current partner, and I find it hard to discuss without sounding like I am not interested in a future with her and she is upset. She concentrates on the fact I am insecure about moving forward financially due to the fact I have been burned badly twice before, and I am carrying that into this relationship, which I understand. I love her and I want to work this out, but I need trust and reassurance from her that my feelings are valid, and help us move through this issue.

edit: Thankyou for the responses as it has been a stressful time for us.

The pros are: 

- her happiness in fulfilling her lifetime goal (she has never had a realtionship last more than a year or so, or anyone wanting to build a life together.)

- financial burden easing for the both of us in regards to paying bills, dead-rent etc.

- wanting to move forward with my life and make a home.

I am feeling guilty that part of me doesn't want to do this with her, and part of me does. It is not fair on her to be indecisive, as she has stated she is going to move forward with her plans regardless, and still have a relationship with me. I feel this will foster resentment.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-14,"AITA for having reservations about buying a house with my financially irresponsible partner?
