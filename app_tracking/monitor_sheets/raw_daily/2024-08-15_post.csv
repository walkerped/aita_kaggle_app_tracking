0,1eskcrg,AITA for Refusing to Rewrite an Apology Letter?,"I (17 nonbinary) had to write my grandfather (70 M) an apology letter. There was a situation a while back where he was a 'sponsor' of sorts for a teen-operated community service organization. The problem is that he's a very old-fashioned guy, and most if not ALL of the members were queer, including me. A large proportion of the members really didn't like him on the basis of misgendering, or him referring to a couple of two girls as 'friends'. Many of them began talking about him behind his back to me. I never encouraged it, but I did vent my own frustrations with him, and didn't tell them to stop. My mother made me write him an apology letter months after the fact, and is displeased with it. I bent over backwards to say I should have stepped in, told them to stop, or talked to him about it (even though that was not an option, since he's an authority figure to us, and confronting someone like him about long-standing bigotry isn't an option, that isn't going to go well.) but that apparently wasn't enough.

Am I the asshole for refusing to rewrite the letter?

  
EDIT: A few key details about the situation I forgot to include: We attempted to explain multiple times how we wanted to be referred to. There were two non-binary people (one okay with he/they, another only with they/them) and a trans guy (he/him), and it was brought up frequently that the two girls were in a relationship. There were a lot of quiet corrections, but he refused to change how he referred to us.

2,1et9pki,AITA For Not Buying My Fiance A Second Wedding Dress That's More than 50% The Total Budget?,"Throwaway Account

My (F49) fianc√© (F32) wants me to buy her a new wedding dress that‚Äôs over 50% the total wedding budget after I already bought her a $8,600 dress.

I‚Äôm marrying the love of my life who is a member of a Native American tribe and lives on a reservation in my city.

I was involved with this tribe before I met her, buying an older woman a mobile home to put on her land when her daughter went to prison leaving her three grandkids to raise when she was living in a 15‚Äô travel trailer.¬†She managed to get the kids out of foster care due to this.

This greased the wheels to get the council to approve us having our wedding on the reservation. I‚Äôm paying for everything and have a $60,000 budget.¬†There will be traditional dancers, drummers, and a traditional feast all catered by women on the reservation.¬† We have an 80 person guestlist‚Äîthe only people coming on my side is my mother and my adult nephew.

Yes, I‚Äôm spreading my money around on the reservation, trying not to be obnoxious about it. Like I said, I‚Äôve seen the poverty many of them go through and I love that my wedding is bringing money there.

My fianc√© said she dreamed of her wedding since she was a little girl.¬†I could care less about weddings, tbh, so I‚Äôve let her be the only ‚Äòbride‚Äô.¬† I‚Äôm going to wear a black gown with tuxedo elements on top to kind of stand in as a ‚Äògroom‚Äô.¬†This way all the attention will be on her. My only rule was that the budget was $60,000 FIRM, not a penny more, and I hired a wedding planner she had to work with to get everything within that budget.

She went out with her girlfriends and decided on a beautiful $8,600 dress. She loved it. It was purchased and fitted. Great.

It‚Äôs three months until the wedding (we‚Äôre doing November because it‚Äôs way too hot to have a summer wedding out here).¬† She was continuing to get things ready with the tribe and the planner.¬† One of the tribal elders brought up her dress.¬† He said she should wear a traditional tribal gown made by one of their artisans.

She sat me down to tell me something ‚Äòserious‚Äô and explained that she couldn‚Äôt wear the gown she bought. She needed a traditional tribal gown. I said to get a quote from the artisan and maybe we could get a partial return and/or sell the other gown to cover it.

The artisan‚Äôs price? $33,000!! It‚Äôs going to be covered with beadwork and she needs to get started NOW.

I said, well it‚Äôs a good thing we already have a gown. She said she would not humiliate herself and dishonor her tribe by wearing the wrong gown.¬†I said I can‚Äôt approve this cost. It would throw the budget out the window.¬†She says I have millions of dollars, and this is our wedding and I‚Äôm being ridiculous.

Yes, I have money. I live off 4% as someone semi-retired. I have this money because I KEEP TO THE BUDGETS I SET.

Now she‚Äôs not talking to me except to remind me every day that if the artisan doesn‚Äôt start now, she won‚Äôt have a dress.

I don‚Äôt know what to do.¬†Am I being the asshole here?

**Edit to Add:  I've noticed some confusion and just want to clear something up. The elder isn't saying she's required to wear the dress. There have been other weddings with non-traditional dresses, like her mother's wedding.  The elder just suggested that since this is panning out to be such a big event for the tribe, it would be appropriate for her to wear a traditional dress.  This is part of why I'm saying that it's still an option for her to wear the original dress.**

**Anyway, she's with her mother right now and I've asked the wedding planner to meet me on the reservation on Monday to see if I can get more information and talk to the dress maker, because as many of you have pointed out it doesn't make sense for the dress to be so expensive.  Some suggest I'm being scammed, but I think it's more of a case of not explaining the situation to the dress maker and asking for something too extravagant.  I'd also like to consider the option of renting the dress.**¬†",Not the A-hole,2024-08-15,"AITA For Not Buying My Fiance A Second Wedding Dress That's More than 50% The Total Budget?

My spouse and I are both healthcare providers. She has multiple people in her family who do not have health insurance, and over the years we have provided them a lot of free healthcare. 

Just recently we helped her with something troubling that the family member was avoiding addressing bc of not having insurance. They were profusely thankful and my friend said she was going to be able to get both of our daughters an after-school job at her workplace (for context my daughter has been looking for a job but we live in a small town and inflation has definitely cut back jobs available around here). They would job-share and take turns working shifts. 

Obviously as a busy teen she needs something close to home that can fit with her after school schedule so this was going to be a huge blessing. Today I found out she got the job just for her daughter instead of hiring them both to job-share. 

Mind you, none of the things we‚Äôve done to help them over the years were with the expectation of something in return. But this was something she said she would do and even promised my daughter. It leaves me feeling that this isn‚Äôt a friend, that this is a person who is just out for herself. A friend keeps their word. And friends help each other out.

4,1et8ti1,AITA I asked my brother to do a task I was given and got yelled at.,"I'll preface by saying they were upset by the text, not my brother doing it for me.

I was watching a movie with my partner on a vr headset, and I kept getting my door knocked on by my brother. I got slightly peeved but just kept watching after answering the door each time.
I get anxious when I have to keep people waiting because of past reasons, so something was building up. The next thing I know, my stepfather (biggest asshole in my life btw)  starts banging on the door, yelling  I have to watch the food on the stove and stir it every few minutes. I had no idea at the time why he was being so urgent because nothing was explained to me. He left and I asked my brother, who was watching something on his phone, to do it for me since it made more sense to me than having me who was trying so hard to watch the movie without being inturupted. I texted our family group 'How long does the stove need to be on for' and I followed it up with 'I had my brother stir it, can you guys please ask me if I'm busy in stead of demanding next time, I mean that in the most polite way'
She replied back with 'not taken respectfully' which I read a different way and thought I was in the clear, imagine my surprise when she comes home and calls me out of my room too yell at me.
We've all been trying to work on the yelling but the parents still escalate too it at bullshit times, especially asshole step-dad. I'm a sensitive person and just want to talk about things calmly but my voice was shaking as I'd already started crying. So my voice sounded panicky but I refused to raise my voice like the old me would have done.
She told me he was in a rush because our water wasn't running right and how it was rude of me to have said that.
I don't understand I even specified that I wasn‚Äôt trying to be disrespectful in the text and I told her I had no idea of the situation prior to that. When she finally dismissed me I was further in tears (I know I'm weak but when I get upset like that the anger and sadness just turns into tears) I went into my room where my brother was and he said I was crying for no good reason. He knows I have trouble controlling it when being yelled at, he's usually my rock in those hard times but he invalidated my feelings just like that and it stung so bad. Only a few minutes passed by before they called me out to make sure I knew I was in the wrong.
Something that gets under my skin more than anything is my step-dad's yelling, he makes sure it's always loud and antagonistic. 
He threatened to cut off wifi like he does in any fight, brings up unrelated shit and says period at the end of his sentences.
I'm proud to say I still didn't raise my voice but oh man was it hard not to.
The final sting was my mother saying 'it's not the end of the world' seeing me still idly crying. 
I never said it was or even claimed to be in the right. I simply explained myself in civil ways and hoped it was enough.

I said yes cause she kept insisting it would be fun, but over the past few weeks I‚Äôve directly expressed I am not happy about going on the trip especially cause I just learned that it‚Äôs 0 a week long, you can‚Äôt bring any electronics for the whole week, no deodorant, and camping isn‚Äôt my thing.

7,1et82mf,AITA for not giving my boss a ride to work?,"I, 21 F, have a car that broke down yesterday and had to be towed to a body shop. MY dad lent me his car to take to work this morning, since I had to be at work at 5:30 AM and the rental car place didn't open until 8AM. My dad's car is a 2022 Toyota Corolla, and is very small. My boss, 63 M, is 6'7"", which is pretty tall. Usually I pick him up for work in the morning, since he does not have a vehicle at the moment.

This morning, I sent him a message at 4:50AM explaining that I wasn't going to pick him up, because I didn't think he would fit in my dad's car, and my dad doesn't want me gallivanting his car around. 

This gave my boss 40 minutes to read the message, call and Uber, like he usually does when he can't get a ride, and even if he had trouble getting a ride to be there at 5:30, he still had 70 minutes to get to the store for opening. By 6:05, he still wasn't at the store, so I called his phone. Straight to voicemail. I called him a total of 6 times, all straight to voicemail.

I can not have the store open when I am alone, and I had no idea where he was. I proceeded to call his boss to ask what I should do, and he didn't answer either. I sent a message to my boss's boss, explaining the situation. I then called one of my coworkers, and asked her to come in, so I could have someone in the store. She arrived at  the store at 6:35, and we then opened. 

My boss then called me right after she arrived, and told me that his phone had died, and his alarm didn't go off. He then asked me why I didn't pick him up, and I explained the situation with my dad's car. He then asked me why I didn't go to his house and knock on his door or ring his doorbell to wake him up. I'm sorry, since when was it in my job description to wake my boss up for work in the morning? 

And needless to say, I had no idea he was asleep anyway, how could I? I figured he had read the message and got himself an Uber. It is not my responsibility to wake him up in the morning. He finally got to the store around 7:30, and proceeded to get mad at me about the situation. I will say, some of the things he said were true, but I did what I thought was right at the time.

EDIT: I sent him a message right after my car got towed, which was yesterday, and I wasn't sure what my situation for getting to work would be.

9,1et7lmn,AITA for telling my boyfriend he should pee outside?,"My boyfriend (19m) and I (19f) have been together for 2 years, but because we are teens he still lives with his mom. They have been having many issues because my bf stays up very late (think 4-6 AM minimum most nights) and he always wakes her up on accident when he goes to the bathroom. She is a light sleeper and so even being quiet on the way to the bathroom still wakes her up.

This has been an ongoing issue for a while now, and I thought I had had a good idea on how to make everyone happy. At night he likes to stay in the living room which is connected to the kitchen (on the opposite side of the house to his mom's room so no chance of waking her up). His kitchen has a door that leads to his backyard, and his backyard has a fence where no one can see in, so I suggested he should just pee outside and wash his hands in the kitchen. He told me it was ""insanely rude to say he should just pee outside like a dog"". I tried to tell him that I wasn't trying to say he was like a dog and explain myself but he just said not to talk to him and not he hasn't spoken to me in a while. 

This was very upsetting for me because I am autistic (he knows this) and have lost many people for accidently saying something rude and nobody would ever explain to me why it was rude. Sorry if this seems obvious, but I genuinely don't understand why what I said was rude. I said it exactly like in this post, please tell me if I was being an asshole and need to apologize.

11,1et6veu,AITA for expecting my roommate to do most of the chores? ,"

My roommate and I (both F 26) have been living together for about a half year.  When we started living together, we had an agreement to split chores and basic finances 50-50. Unfortunately, she was laid off three months ago and hasn‚Äôt been able to pay her part of rent and bills. 

Her previous job wasn‚Äôt paying very well so she didn‚Äôt have much savings. For the last two months, I‚Äôve been paying for everything. However, she hasn‚Äôt gotten a job yet and her field is quite flooded, so there‚Äôs no hope for anything soon. She‚Äôs been doing part-times but all that can do is buy groceries sometimes. 

So yesterday I sat her down and pointed out that rent is quite expensive (which is the whole reason we started living together) and while I don‚Äôt mind paying it for the foreseeable future, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair for us to continue splitting chores 50-50 when finances are out of balance. So I suggested she do most of the chores until she‚Äôs back on her feet then we can return to an even split. Her reaction was pretty much ""Why would you tell me something like that?"" 

Apart from being roommates, we have also been close friends since middle school, so I think I may have overstepped. We haven‚Äôt said a word since then and I don‚Äôt know how to continue the conversation without knowing if my suggestion made me an asshole.

12,1et6t4b,AITA For not cancelling plans to help my wife drive my stepdaughter to college,"My wife (41F) and I (43M) have been married for 6 years.  We both have kids from previous relationships.  I have 2 sons (14 & 12).  I split custody with my ex-wife.  My wife has 2 daughters (18 & 15).  She has primary custody of them because her ex is in the military.  He is currently deployed in Europe.  My oldest stepdaughter is going to college out of state this fall.  My wife's ex was hoping to be able to come home to help move her to school, but that isn't going to work.  

The weekend that stepdaughter is supposed to move in is the last extended time I am going to have with my sons before school starts up again.  I have planned a small camping trip for the 3 of us to get some good bonding in.  

When my wife's ex told her that he isn't going to make it home to help with the move, my wife asked if I would be willing to come with on the 7-hour drive to stepdaughter's college.  She doesn't feel comfortable making that drive all by herself and doesn't have anyone else to ask.  I reminded her that I am taking my sons camping that weekend.  She suggested that we instead turn it into a family road trip.  I told her that kind of defeats the purpose of the camping trip, which was to spend time with just my sons and to relax.  

Even if we find things to do on the drive, that's still just hours and hours spent in a car instead of doing what we had originally planned.  My wife's argument is that I can always plan another camping trip with my sons, but that stepdaughter only moves away for college once.  She said that since it's such a big life event for stepdaughter, I should come with to show that I support her because she feels bad her dad can't make it.  

I told her that I am not going to ask my sons to sacrifice something they've been looking forward to in exchange for making my stepdaughter feel better about her dad missing out.  I said that my sons are reaching an age where they probably aren't going to want to spend weekends alone with their dad out in the woods much anymore and I want to take advantage of that while I still can.  

My wife got upset with me and told me that I am playing favorites with my kids over hers.  I told her that it's not my fault her ex can't make it and if she wants to be mad at someone, she can complain to the US military.  She told me she knows it's not my fault, but I am in a position to help be a father figure when stepdaughter needs one.  She asked if I would at least talk to my sons about the road trip idea, but I told her I won't do that.

I suggested she ask a friend to come with her but she said that's not the point.  To her, the point is that since her ex can't make it, I am next in line as a father figure to help stepdaughter with this transition.

13,1et6ori,AITA for telling my family to buy my dog a new bed?,"For reference, my dog is a 75 lbs Irish Setter that is currently in training to be a service animal (that was the purpose of getting him). I had a doctor's appointment today and as he isn't fully trained I opted to leave him home. My family have no issue with him, he isn't disruptive and will just lay around all day. The only issue is that he doesn't like our roomba. Usually he'll just walk around the house to avoid it until it finishes, however when I'm not home my family has started putting him in his crate when it comes on. I never told them that this is something they need to do and reminded them multiple times that if they put him in the crate they need to take him back out because he'll chew up his bed. This has been firmly communicated since I brought him home almost 3 years ago. I've tried toys or a Kong but he gets the treats out instantly even if it's the canned stuff frozen inside. He's always had an affinity for fabric to the point where I've stopped purchasing fabric toys for him because he rips them up within 30 minutes, he takes kevlar or 'indestructable' as a challenge. Another alternative that I do when I put him in the crate for long periods of time while he's unsupervised is take the bed out.

Our roomba goes on every day at 12 and isn't on longer than thirty minutes to an hour. I came home at 4:30 to find my dog locked in his crate with his bed completely destroyed. I told my sister she would have to buy a new one to which she blamed my mom, but regardless they all refuse and say it's not their problem. Beds for big dogs are far from cheap but I got lucky with the $24 clearance at Petco for this one. I could alternatively just ask for the $24, but it's admittedly frustrating that I'll probably have to pay another $50 on top of that for a decent replacement.

In the future I'll know to take his bed out of his crate when I leave the house, but obviously as of right now there is no bed to take out. As my dog I understand that he is my responsibility and I do have the funds to replace it, it's just frustrating that I knew this was a problem he had and actively do things to prevent it just for it to happen anyway.

AITA?

Clarification: (1) He is fully trained besides his main task of mobility which can't be started until a dog is fully developed at at least two years old to prevent issues. He stays home because I just got my license and my parents think I'll lose my job/won't find one because of him (which is, like, illegal but yk üíÄ)

(2) When sleeping in his crate at night he leaves the bed untouched, however he sleeps on one because I'm scared he'll develop some other issue like hip dysplasia due to the reasons above.

As my dog I understand that he is my responsibility and I do have the funds to replace it, it's just frustrating that I knew this was a problem he had and actively do things to prevent it just for it to happen anyway.

AITA?

Clarification: (1) He is fully trained besides his main task of mobility which can't be started until a dog is fully developed at at least two years old to prevent issues. He stays home because I just got my license and my parents think I'll lose my job/won't find one because of him (which is, like, illegal but yk üíÄ)

(2) When sleeping in his crate at night he leaves the bed untouched, however he sleeps on one because I'm scared he'll develop some other issue like hip dysplasia due to the reasons above. If you have any alternatives or recommendations they would be appreciated!",1.0,1.0508745908737183,1,1

15,1et6d7w,AITA for bailing on a bachelor party last minute due to health concerns?,"Throwaway account, but I am supposed to be going on a bachelor party trip out of the country tomorrow. Everything has been planned and paid for already (we all had to chip in so it's also my money that has gone towards this). 

Within the past 6 months, I have been going through some health issues which has been requiring me to be near a bathroom (you can probably guess why). Within the past month it has got exceptionally worse with no improvements. Last week, I was prescribed some medication that makes me feel quite dizzy and drowsy. So now on top of having to be near a bathroom, I am also on some medication that makes me feel not normal. 

However I continued to bank on the chance that I would be fine by the time of the trip, so I did not mention anything to any of the members of the bachelor party about my conditions. It's extremely embarrassing to bring the topic up, but I know I had to if I wasn't going to be able to make the trip. Today I decided to (1 day before the trip) tell the groom and another friend that because of these health issues, it probably wouldn't be best if I went on the trip. They are not only sad but quite angry/upset that I waited until the last moment to tell them, and are now trying to come up with their own solutions so that I can go (we'll make sure you have access to a bathroom at all times, we'll make sure you have the aisle seat so you can go to the bathroom as needed, etc.). While I understand and appreciate them trying to find solutions, I already know that I will not be up for drinking, eating new foods, and being on water for several hours without a bathroom. 

It's still up in the air about whether I go or not, my friends keep telling me everything will be fine, but they don't know how I feel. I do really want to go and see my friends, but I'd feel terrible if my conditions dampened the mood, or even worse, leads to me having an accident/going home early.

17,1et66u9,AITA for making my in-laws stay in a hotel after they surprised us on our family vacation?,"Throwaway & randomly generated username. I do not claim to be a significant cook

I (37F) took a beach vacation with my husband(40M) & our 3 kids(4, 2, 3mo). We also invited his sister, husband & 2 kids (4, 3) as we had a detached bedroom from the main house and we genuinely like hanging out with them. I told her we wanted to keep it small this year since we have a new baby, I‚Äôm pretty fresh postpartum and I didn‚Äôt want it to be too stressful

While we were at the beach we see my MIL, FIL, stepson(20) & his GF pull up. This is a 3hr drive from where we live. They came to surprise us at the beach since we haven‚Äôt seen my SS in 2 months. My SIL said they've been planning this for weeks & she gave them the mile marker. This was a cool surprise, but afterwards they expected to stay with us in our 1bd/1ba rental house with no real doors(only sliding doors). They had no plans for lodging or eating, so we got to work to make dinner which was fine because I had packed extra food. Due to space constraints, I put the baby down for a nap in the restroom (we had 2 pack-and-plays in there). When I went back to check on him a little later, my SS & his GF were in the transparent glass shower together steps away from my 3mo old baby

I went back to the kitchen and told SIL they cannot stay with us. My husband told them they could because he is out of touch with what that would actually mean (6 adults, 2 toddlers sharing one RR where 2 babies are sleeping). I told her what I just saw with SS and GF in the shower, again reminding her it‚Äôs too many people going in and out of the RR with 2 kids asleep in there. She understood and started looking up hotels

My SS's GF was already scoping out the couch and she could have slept there but after wrestling 2 babies to sleep in the RR and my 4yo to sleep in the actual bed, the couch was the only place I could sit & have a glass of wine at the end of the night in peace

After getting a hotel room, they stayed at the beach house until midnight playing poker on the patio and shouting. My husband asked his dad to please be quiet since the kids were sleeping and FIL loudly shouted ‚Äúshut up‚Äù and kept playing

This has since caused major conflict with my husband as he believes we should have just let 4 additional people stay since ‚Äúthey are family‚Äù. We paid for half the hotel room and my SIL paid the other half

For context, we have been to the beach one other time with my SIL (last year) but have never been with my MIL and FIL. My SS has been gone for 2 months but will be in town the next 3 weeks, so it‚Äôs not like we wouldn‚Äôt have seen him the next day when we returned.

18,1et625x,AITA for keeping lights on at night while working in a shared room?,"So, for the past 15 days, I (20F) have been living in a shared hostel room in a new city because I have some internship work here. I'm here for the whole month of August, and need to stay 2 more weeks. 

The roommate I have here is a college student who's been living in the room alone for the past 2 years since incidentally nobody else rented the other bed. So I did know that someone who was living alone would have a tough time adjusting, and I only had to stay a month so I didn't really mind her quirks which bothered me (she always wakes up at 6am, turns on the lights, taken showers with music and is extremely load while talking on the phone in the morning). It disturbs my sleep ofcourse, but I have an eye mask and earplugs so I managed since I didn't feel it was worth getting into it with someone I have to stay with only for a month.

I've been swamped with work for the past few days, meaning that I've had to work at night. Now there's no common space to work in outside the room, so I've been working the room at night with the lights off so my roommate can sleep. I don't mind working in the dark (I've been told it is bad and would strain my eyes, but I do let it go and accommodate if I'm sharing).

So today, I had a lot of work and slept really late. Again, in the morning, she wakes up and does the whole thing of opening all the lights and talking loudly. I ask her for some consideration that she turn the lights off when she leaves, she doesn't do that.

When she comes back (so there's a shared table in the room and a shared chair on which we both had kept our stuff), while I'm in the washroom, she takes off all the stuff from the shared table and chair and keeps it on my bed. I ask her why, and she said she needs to work. It's fine, I let it go since I have to only stay for 2 more weeks. She turns on all the lights again. I'm extremely tired and sleepy since I slept late for work and ask if I can turn off the lights for today only please, she said no she's working.  So I manage and sleep through that (not a good sleep cause ofc she has to call her mom during the study time and talk loudly, almost like she's purposely doing it?)

But now here's where I feel like I'm the asshole. Even though I did let go of everything, it still kinda made me pissed, so today night I said I'm working and will keep the lights on.  She said no and started saying that she cannot sleep without lights off but I tell her that she always turns it on when I'm sleeping, and I always endure it and today also I slept through it so she should manage too. 

She tried to pester me many times but I said no.

20,1et607f,AITA for wearing my moms new socks?,"AITA for wearing my moms new socks?
So a few days ago I (16f) was looking for good pair of sneaker socks. Unfortunately in my closet there were only a few ones I usually avoid to wear because they are a bit small and my feet were already a bit damaged from a long walk with our dog (with a pair of socks I usually avoid to wear). So then I went to my mom‚Äôs (45f) Closet because we have a similar shoe size and in the past wearing each other‚Äôs socks was never a problem. Yeah, and then I did what was looking back at it wasn‚Äôt probably the smartest/nicest move: I was looking through the drawer with her socks and just saw high socks, which wasn‚Äôt working because I was wearing shorts, so I choose to take a pair of a pack unopened socks. It was a three pack and a few days later I took the second pair.

The moment she found out which was again a few days later, I was not at home and we were having a conversation via text messages. She asked: ‚ÄûDid you steal my puma sneakers?‚Äú and I said no because I totally didn‚Äôt get that she meant her socks because I thought she meant actual shoes. Even as she mentioned that only the white pair of the three was left, I just said that she should look cellar (some shoes are in the cellar). 
She then asked why she should be looking in the cellar.
And I replied with: ‚Äûthat‚Äôs where we usually some store things‚Äú
After this our conversation went on without mentioning it again.

I think this was the day after when mom was going for a walk with our dog. I took the chance and went into the cellar looking for her pairs of puma shoes which was hopeless because there were no shoes. Later I told my mom that I seas looking for her shoes and that I couldn‚Äôt find them.
As my mom asked what shoes I looking for and she was missing socks, I finally understood and immediately said that I took them.

Yeah she got really angry at me and told me that these socks were her Birthday (was a month ago) gift from her parents and she herself didn‚Äôt dare to wear them yet. I promise I didn‚Äôt know this. 
Moreover, she was also upset about the fact that I hadn‚Äôt ask but both occasions she wasn‚Äôt at home.

So a few days ago I (16f) was looking for good pair of sneaker socks. Unfortunately in my closet there were only a few ones I usually avoid to wear because they are a bit small and my feet were already a bit damaged from a long walk with our dog (with a pair of socks I usually avoid to wear). So then I went to my mom‚Äôs (45f) Closet because we have a similar shoe size and in the past wearing each other‚Äôs socks was never a problem. Yeah, and then I did what was looking back at it wasn‚Äôt probably the smartest/nicest move: I was looking through the drawer with her socks and just saw high socks, which wasn‚Äôt working because I was wearing shorts, so I choose to take a pair of a pack unopened socks. It was a three pack and a few days later I took the second pair.

The moment she found out which was again a few days later, I was not at home and we were having a conversation via text messages. She asked: ‚ÄûDid you steal my puma sneakers?‚Äú and I said no because I totally didn‚Äôt get that she meant her socks because I thought she meant actual shoes. Even as she mentioned that only the white pair of the three was left, I just said that she should look cellar (some shoes are in the cellar). 
She then asked why she should be looking in the cellar.
And I replied with: ‚Äûthat‚Äôs where we usually some store things‚Äú
After this our conversation went on without mentioning it again.

I think this was the day after when mom was going for a walk with our dog. I took the chance and went into the cellar looking for her pairs of puma shoes which was hopeless because there were no shoes. Later I told my mom that I seas looking for her shoes and that I couldn‚Äôt find them.
As my mom asked what shoes I looking for and she was missing socks, I finally understood and immediately said that I took them.

Yeah she got really angry at me and told me that these socks were her Birthday (was a month ago) gift from her parents and she herself didn‚Äôt dare to wear them yet. I promise I didn‚Äôt know this. 
Moreover, she was also upset about the fact that I hadn‚Äôt ask but both occasions she wasn‚Äôt at home.
Even when I told her about my small-socks-problem she wasn‚Äôt having it.

21,1et5wse,AITA telling my friend to stop copying me?,"Hello,

I planned my first tattoo with my best friend and got it with her. After the first tattoo, she got much more. For the second tattoo I didn't want her to have the same one. After a little discussion, we decided that I would be allowed to choose the tattoo and that she would also take on this motif.

Now I wanted a third tattoo, which she also wanted. I wanted to have this tattoo by ¬†myself and I had to get it in secret. She didn't like that so much.

Now I come to the actual point. I've been wearing glasses since I was a child and have always had to settle for cheap glasses that I couldn't choose properly. At the same time, I couldn't always replace them when they broke.

I now have a good job and was able to afford nice, good glasses for the first time. I had planned this for months in advance and was looking forward to it.

Now the two storys are connected. After my friend wasn't happy with the tattoo, she happily told me that she wanted to get the same glasses.¬† I then told her that I didn't like that idea. The reason I told her was that it was a big part of my personality and that I felt a bit harassed or hurt by it. At the same time, I said that we don't have to have everything the same and that makes me feel insecure.

For this reason she is now angry with me and says that I‚Äôm being dramatic. Now I wonder: AITA?

I told them that I am still willing to help them out but I won‚Äôt be available until late Friday night since I will have to stay late for work.

I do understand the frustration of people backing out of plans last minute. But I truly don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to finish my project if I don‚Äôt work late tomorrow. They never gave me an exact time for Friday either they just said Friday after work.

25,1et5c6e,AITA for refusing to cut my in-law's grass,"So a little backstory, my husband (M47) and I(F41) live next door to his parents. The two yards combined is approximately 3 acres (2.25 for theirs and .75 for ours). We were paying someone $400/month to cut both yards for many years and were splitting the cost based on size.  In 2021 my FIL had a heart attack and we chose to take over the cost of the yard payments due to uncertainty for his health. Fast forward to 2023 and he was doing much better and in the beginning of the year asked if we could go in together on the purchase of a lawnmower to share in yard work instead of paying someone else. My husband and I agreed and purchased a large mower for $4700. He paid us $500 and mowed his own grass up until late August and he started having some health issues. I continued cutting their grass the rest of the season and then he sadly passed away in November of 2023. I still continued cutting the grass for my MIL without hesitation this year.

Fast forward to June of this year. My husband's sister, her husband, and 2 teens moved into my MIL's house. The husband doesn't work and the teens are 15F and 17M. Initially the husband swore he would do all if the edging/trimming if I would cut the grass. After I cut the yard twice with no one ever popping their head out of the air conditioning,  I'm pretty irritated.  So I tell my SIL to get quotes on having someone else cut it because it's too much for me (6+ hours in the heat of the South). Now it feels like everyone is treating me differently/not talking to me. Am I the asshole?

ETA: Husband is not the issue here. He is very supportive of the decision to not cut their grass anymore. I do the lawncare because he works 70 hours a week and I want him to be able to relax on his time off. I was working part time when this all started and now I stay at home full time.

Every time my dad picks me up from a place, he always complains about having to wait for long periods of time and tells me that I‚Äôd have to walk home if I didn‚Äôt come out of the building in under a minute. (e.g. school) He always tells me I should be waiting right outside of the building, watching for his car to pull up to the driveway, but sometimes it‚Äôs too hot or cold to be doing that. 

I don‚Äôt really find a problem with making him wait for too long as he doesn‚Äôt do too much for me, he doesn‚Äôt work and I do all the cleaning, cooking, laundry and chores for myself. At home I‚Äôm always either studying, cleaning, or cooking, with of course the occasional break, but my dad is always watching movies or playing video games, and tells me I should be doing more around the house, so I think it‚Äôs fair that he drives me around places.

28,1et57o9,AITA for disinviting my cousin from my wedding cause of him spreading lies about me to my fiance ?,"I (25F) and my fiance (27M) are supposed to get married in 3 months. I have a cousin (23M) with whom I used to be pretty close before this incident. He also became really close friends with my fiance and lately he's been hanging out with my cousin much more than I ever did. Yesterday, after my fiance came back from hanging out with my cousin he out of nowhere started accusing me of being pregnant and asked me if I was seeing another man cause he didn't think the child could be his as he used protection. I asked him wtf he was talking about as I'm not pregnant nor am I cheating on him, but he said that my cousin already told him about my pregnancy and his concerns that he may not be the father so now he wanted the truth. 

I was completely dumbfounded as I can't understand why my cousin would've told him something like this, as he's never done anything like this before. My fiance literally refused to believe me till I did a pregnancy test to prove to him that I wasn't actually pregnant. When I confronted my cousin about why he lied to my fiance he said that he assumed I must've been pregnant cause of how suspicious I'm been acting lately (I don't even know whatt that's supposed to be mean and he didn't give me a clear answer) and he wanted to give my fiance a heads up. He said he never implied that my potential child would've been another man's and my fiance must've assumed that cause he was using protection, even tho my fiance explicitly said that my cousin warned him that I might be pregnant with another man.

I tried to pressure him to give me a clear answer but he just told me to leave him alone as it wasn't that big of a deal as me and my fiance already sorted it out. Honestly I was so mad at his lack of transparency that I told him that I'd prefer if he didn't attend our wedding after what happened.

My fiance agreed with my request but he wenrt to visit my cousin even today even tho we still haven't addressed the issues about his lies fully. AITA ?

Update: 

I'm shocked to see how much my post blew up. I honestly thought it wouldn't get more than a a few of comments. I'm gonna reply here to some of your comments as it'd take a lot to reply to them separately.

Some of you think I'm not being harsh enough with my fiance. I think this may be true but I was truly shocked by his behavior. He never made these type of accusations to me before, so I really didn't know in the moment how I should react to them. Today I had another conversation with my fiance about his accusations and this time I truly let him know how much it hurt me that he'd think so little of me to believe I'd cheat on him and then pass off another man's child as his. He apologized to me and said that he only believed this cause my cousin warned him of the possibility and he knows how close the two of us are (or used to be before this incident) and he didn't think he'd lie about me. 

Also I let him know that my decision to not let my cousin attend our wedding is finale and I'm not going to walk back on it after my cousin's clear lack of remorse for his actions. My fiance tried to protest it but I told him that him defending my cousin when he almost jeopardized our entire relationship makes me believe he values him more than our relationship and I can't go through with the wedding with a man that doesn't have my well being as his top priority. He eventually relented and apologized again for defending my cousin as my fiance still doesn't believe he did any of this with malicious intent.

Some of you also suggested that my fiance is cheating with my cousin. I honestly don't think this could be true as neither my fiance or my cousin ever shown or talked about being attracted to other men. However I think there's indeed a possibility after what happened that my fiance could be cheating on me (and my cousin's covering up for him) as his reaction to thinking that I might be pregnant being to believe that I'd been sleeping with another man was indeed very unnatural and as if he didn't want this hypothetical child to be his. I didn't bring this up with my fiance yet as I plan to dig a bit deeper into this, potentially even talking with my cousin again to see what the two of them have been truly hiding. I might update again, even if my fiance ends up being innocent (outside of being an easily to manipulate fool that is).",Not the A-hole,2024-08-15,"AITA for disinviting my cousin from my wedding cause of him spreading lies about me to my fiance ? I (25F) and my fiance (27M) are supposed to get married in 3 months. I have a cousin (23M) with whom I used to be pretty close before this incident. He also became really close friends with my fiance and lately he's been hanging out with my cousin much more than I ever did. Yesterday, after my fiance came back from hanging out with my cousin he out of nowhere started accusing me of being pregnant and asked me if I was seeing another man cause he didn't think the child could be his as he used protection. I asked him wtf he was talking about as I'm not pregnant nor am I cheating on him, but he said that my cousin already told him about my pregnancy and his concerns that he may not be the father so now he wanted the truth. 

I was completely dumbfounded as I can't understand why my cousin would've told him something like this, as he's never done anything like this before. My fiance literally refused to believe me till I did a pregnancy test to prove to him that I wasn't actually pregnant. When I confronted my cousin about why he lied to my fiance he said that he assumed I must've been pregnant cause of how suspicious I'm been acting lately (I don't even know whatt that's supposed to be mean and he didn't give me a clear answer) and he wanted to give my fiance a heads up. He said he never implied that my potential child would've been another man's and my fiance must've assumed that cause he was using protection, even tho my fiance explicitly said that my cousin warned him that I might be pregnant with another man.

I tried to pressure him to give me a clear answer but he just told me to leave him alone as it wasn't that big of a deal as me and my fiance already sorted it out. Honestly I was so mad at his lack of transparency that I told him that I'd prefer if he didn't attend our wedding after what happened. He was shocked and said I was overreacting over a silly mistake and that I should let it go, but I told him that for now this is my decision.

29,1et56ip,AITA for telling my family it‚Äôs weird they say my aunt is like my wife?,"
A few months ago, my aunt moved in with me because she was going through some financial difficulties. We‚Äôve always been really close, so it was a no-brainer for me to offer her a place to stay. I told her she didn‚Äôt need to worry about rent; I just wanted to help her out while she got back on her feet.

Even though I never asked her to, she started cooking and cleaning around the apartment. She‚Äôs always been the type to take care of others, so I wasn‚Äôt surprised, but I didn‚Äôt expect it either. Honestly, it‚Äôs been great having her around, and it‚Äôs brought us even closer. We talk all the time, and she‚Äôs been a huge support for me as well.

Recently, though, some family members started making weird comments about how my aunt is like my wife because of the cooking and cleaning. They‚Äôve joked about it a few times, and it makes me really uncomfortable. I told them it‚Äôs strange to say that, especially since she‚Äôs my aunt, but they just laugh it off.

I brought it up with my aunt, and she immediately agreed it was weird. She said, ‚ÄúIf anything, I‚Äôm more like your mom than anything else.‚Äù We both found it uncomfortable, and she‚Äôs on my side about telling them to stop making those comments.

I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for a year and a half, and living together for nearly just as long, I split from my ex not long before getting with my now boyfriend and never realised just how badly it impacted me and caused a lot of mental issues until it became a regular argument with my boyfriend 

He has two close female friends, one an ex from years ago who he got back with again before breaking up with again, not speaking for ages then forming a friendship and one he met years ago from a dating site.

I didn‚Äôt think I would have such issues with him being friends with an ex but his friendships with both females has caused a lot of paranoia and arguments, he thinks I‚Äôm just overthinking things and calls me paranoid, I think his closeness with them disrespects me and our relationship.
He has banter with his ex where they take this mick out of each other or speak on the phone/facetime (she‚Äôs in a relationship and apparently is very happy in it)
His other friend, they text a lot and spend hours talking on the phone to each other or FaceTiming when I‚Äôm not there (mainly because of the arguments it would cause because of me and my head) 
He love hearted a selfie of her and her son which caused an argument because in my mind yeah it‚Äôs a nice photo but why does it deserve a heart emoji? He said I‚Äôm not looking at the context of it and it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs dressed inappropriate or anything and that it‚Äôs just a family photo
When we‚Äôve had arguments, he speaks to her and gets her opinion on it which feels like there‚Äôs no privacy being in this relationship. He asked me to ask my coworkers their opinion on him hearting that photo and they agreed with me, I asked them their opinion and made sure to mention my paranoia issues so they could give their honest opinion (now we‚Äôre all wrong because of their issues make this opinion unreliable) but his friend‚Äôs opinion is right which makes him right (let‚Äôs face it, people will agree to something when it benefits them) 
The latest argument was we was texting each other then he read my message and never replied back (he said he had nothing to respond back to it) but then said he had been on the phone to his friend for hours, which made me feel like my conversation wasn‚Äôt as important and I‚Äôm not as much as a priority as he said I am. 
Despite living together, I don‚Äôt feel we have a lot of deep, hours long conversations but he seems to be able to get his mental stimulation from talking to them for hours.
He has cut out friends before when his ex had issues with it but says he‚Äôll never do that again (he only has female friends as he doesn‚Äôt connect to males)

to start from the beginning when I was younger (my entire childhood) I had a dollhouse from my great grandmother. in 2019 my great grandmother had passed away. before she did my family had planned what would happen to her belongings. technically the dollhouse belonged to my great grandmother but she gave it to me as a young child. we had all put in writing what we would all want and I made sure to put the dollhouse down before she died to make sure nothing would be fought over. my paper has 'mysteriously' disappeared. after she passed sue took my dollhouse and said that she was going to hold onto it for me for when we moved into a house and had space for it. me and my mother agreed that it would be okay because we did not have space for it at the time. 

last year we moved into a house and asked for the dollhouse back. sue said that she would not be giving it back, that she was saving it for her son's children (my uncles kids) so they could play with it. I said absolutely not, the dollhouse was in great condition when I left it, it was a very nice one too. it spinds around on a stand and has a front porch, every kids dream. she said that it was not up for debate, that she was keeping it. 

I have been fighting for almost a year now to get my dollhouse back and one month ago there was a development. 

I went to get my great grandmothers sewing machine before that was confiscated too (I am the only one in my family that can sew and anyone else would just sell it) it is a very nice machine, an old singer that flips up from a table. sue came over to my great grandfather's house (where we were) and started yelling at us that we needed to get out and we couldn't be there. we ignored her and continued to get it (we had my grandfather's permission) and she called the cops on us. the cops showed up and told her that there was nothing they could do because we weren't doing anything wrong. that made her so angry and we left with the machine/table. 

I texted sue a couple weeks ago simply saying 'hi' with no response. she hasn't blocked me, my messages are going through but she's ignoring me. ive attempted to get in contact with her multiple times with no response.

I invited a (27F) out with me to keep me company since we been talking for weeks. It wasn't a relationship thing, it was just wanting to properly understand introduce myself. I invited her and she said that she would be coming. I checked her Instagram and saw she was not too far from where I was. Fine whatever was my response. She responded back of I was going to buy her drinks? Yeah sure whatever. We at a bar.

Things went downhill after she responded that she was bringing a friend. I'm trying to figure out who is the friend and why she's trying to bring him? I got angry and flipped out.

She stayed for about 30 minutes. I'm busy looking at the TV playing video games and she just talking. She and the guy left out and I later messaged her telling her that was straight disrespectful for that. She had shown me nothing but utter disrespect. Her response was to try to and say that I was some type of predator. I flipped out and told her I'm too busy working and trying to take care of myself. I invited her out the kindness of my heart to introduce myself.

43,1et10ja,AITA for voting to sell the family cottage,"Back in 94 my grandpa put the family cottage into a partnership that included him, my parents, me, and my 4 siblings (we were small kids). He did this to legally protect the cottage since my grandma was suffering from severe mental illness and was talking about giving the cottage away. 

The cottage was built by hand by my great grandpa over 100 years ago. It is a seasonal 1600 sq ft oceanfront property on the coast of Maine in a cute tourist town. The cottage is located next to two other homes, with which it shares a dock and parking, and those homes are shared by many members of the extended family. The cottage is a very sentimental place to many.

Since 08 my grandpa was begging to add his daughters to the partnership. He said not including them was one of the biggest regrets of his life. Adding my Aunts was not allowed to be under consideration because my mom absolutely refused to work them.

My grandpa ran the place as GP and would rent it out to pay for upkeep. We would put in sweat equity every Spring and Fall. My grandpa and Aunts were suspicious that my parents wanted to sell the cottage. My grandpa kept saying that ‚Äúthis is not a money maker from rentals ‚Äì we break even‚Äù and that the cottage is intended to be passed down to the next generation. My parents insisted that the reason they did not want the Aunts included was because my mom didn‚Äôt want to work with them. They said they did not want to sell the place. My mom would always say that if someone needed a life saving medical procedure ONLY THEN would we sell it. My Aunt‚Äôs could use it every summer and it would stay in the family‚Äìso why do they need shares? This was their main argument for not including them.

Grandpa passed away 07/25/2024. According to the partnership, we have 90 days to unanimously decide to continue, otherwise the cottage goes up for sale. My grandpa's dying wish was that we don‚Äôt sell the cottage. The only person that wants to not sell in my immediate family is one brother. My mom, who wanted to run the place, now wants to sell because she wants to pay off her mortgage. Her and my father are in their 60s and have 0 for retirement. My other brother bought a house that needs repairs. I have kids and can‚Äôt save enough to afford a downpayment on a house. Most of us dislike putting sweat equity into the place. We are going to try and sell shares to extended family (10% off) but I don‚Äôt think there is enough money ‚Äì it would be about 700k. If we sell everyone would get \~100k. We would split the profit 9 ways to include my Aunt‚Äôs. My SIL says that the place isn‚Äôt ours to sell, that we are stewards of it for future generations, and that we are basically stealing from her son (whom she wants to experience the place). My brother and SIL have offered to run the place and maintain it, and not ask anything of us. But everyone wants the money so it looks like it‚Äôs going to get sold.

Grandpa passed away 07/25/2024. According to the partnership, we have 90 days to unanimously decide to continue, otherwise the cottage goes up for sale. My grandpa's dying wish was that we don‚Äôt sell the cottage. The only person that wants to not sell in my immediate family is one brother. My mom, who wanted to run the place, now wants to sell because she wants to pay off her mortgage. Her and my father are in their 60s and have 0 for retirement. My other brother bought a house that needs repairs. I have kids and can‚Äôt save enough to afford a downpayment on a house. Most of us dislike putting sweat equity into the place. We are going to try and sell shares to extended family (10% off) but I don‚Äôt think there is enough money ‚Äì it would be about 700k. If we sell everyone would get \~100k. We would split the profit 9 ways to include my Aunt‚Äôs. My SIL says that the place isn‚Äôt ours to sell, that we are stewards of it for future generations, and that we are basically stealing from her son (whom she wants to experience the place). My brother and SIL have offered to run the place and maintain it, and not ask anything of us. But everyone wants the money so it looks like it‚Äôs going to get sold. AITA for voting to sell the family cottage?

44,1et0yok,AITA for evicting my daughter and selling her home? ,"In 2020 I bought my daughter‚Äôs Alexis town home (that she was renting from someone else) that she has been living in since 2016. 

My daughter was having a tough time since her divorce and the prices was under market in August of 2020. 

I was stupid and naive about Alxis. She said she got screwed over in the divorce even though she received alamony. Her ex moved out in March 2020 and she had a previous roommate that she said she hated from March - January (I bought the house during this time butI couldn‚Äôt legally evict that roommate due to Covid laws) I was happy when she moved out on her own. 

Next was Alexis boyfriend and she refused to rent out the spare room with bathroom and moving him in. He was a grifter and held these odd jobs like instana cart. He moved out in late 2023 and I operated the townhouse at a loss because they never matched me on rent to cover my mortgage. 

Next there was this new girl Amanda who sub leased from my daughters.  This is for a room in a popular spot in California and Alexis said she was changing her $2000 and Alexis was paying her part. I thought Amanda defaulted because that‚Äôs what my daughter told me. I moved in with eviction paperwork as soon as I could legally do so. It was sent and Amanda had a lawyer and showed me the receipts where she paid Alexis every month on time or earlier. I asked my daughter wtf is going on and my daughter lied to me it has been her not paying. I‚Äôm stupid and at moment that I realize Alexis was the problem. Amanda still moved out and I have a pending lawsuit from her. 

I told Alexis that I‚Äôm sick of owning this town house at a loss and I‚Äôm selling it before the housing bubble bust.

My mom had a car when I was very young, but most of my child and teenage years we had one car and my dad drove us around. My mom has a stigmatism, and never really liked to drive, so I guess it worked for them. My parents got divorced when I was 18. Mom started dating soon after. He picked up the mantle as chauffeur for mom & sis. Mom got a car (first time in over a decade) and would drive to and from work while my ‚Äústepdad‚Äù would drop my sister off at school, pick her up, and do allllll the other driving. 

They divorced at the end of last year. My sister is more active than ever. This past June, she did a month long program 7 hours away. There‚Äôs no way my mom can make that drive, and if she did it would be more like 12 hours. So I rented a car, drove them there and drove back. Rented another car a month later to do it again. It was my first time driving that far and long and it was tiring. I only got 10 vacation days from my job and used 2 for this. My mom wanted to go to an event in July, and instead of buying plane tickets like I thought she would do, she said ‚Äúwe (meaning me) can just drive there, it‚Äôs the same amount of time, 7 hours‚Äù. So, I used another vacation day, rented a car, drove them there and back. I had a nice time and was happy to see some family, but I was glad to get home and be done driving. 

Now my sister just HAS to go to this concert 3 hours away in September. I told her ok, I‚Äôll rent another car and take her. Luckily I don‚Äôt have to use a vacation day this time. I text my sister all the time, she never texts back. She‚Äôs a teenager and keeps her phone on dnd so I get it. She texts me last night finally replying to a text I sent weeks ago. Then came the ‚Äúalso, do you think you can drop me off and pick me up at this program I‚Äôm doing later in September‚Äù. It‚Äôs 3 hours away. I didn‚Äôt respond because I was annoyed. Then my mom texts me this morning to ask if I can pick my sister up from practice tomorrow evening and I just want to scream. 

I‚Äôm growing tired of spending so much money on rentals and driving hours away. I‚Äôm tired of giving up the few vacation days I have. I‚Äôm tired of giving up my weekends for my sister just to be ignored any other time. I‚Äôm 28 and live with my aunt, trying to save for my own place.

My two older sisters Brianna (37f) and Emily (40f) are both married and parents. I'm dating but not married or a parent yet. But, and this is relevant, I work in childcare and for the past 2.5 years I have been working with kids in a daycare that provides both baby/toddler care but also after school care for kids. So no parenting experience but experience taking care of kids and feeding them.

Brianna has two of her three kids who are very fussy/picky eaters. She has struggled for about a year to get them to eat any kind of veggie. She confided in me about four months ago that she was seriously considering hiding veggies in sauces and other stuff, coming up with creative ways to hide them. But she was worried she'd be judged for not just taking a stand and making them eat the veggies. I reassured her that it wasn't something she should be judged for and informed her the daycare I work at do that very thing for the meals we provide. I said it helps kids eat better without all the fights and at the end of the day getting this stuff into them is more important. And kids can be stubborn. I shared some recipes we use at the daycare and she started making them, which worked. She was so happy because now her kids are getting so many veggies into them instead of none. It also helped her introduce a bit more fruit as well.

Emily found out about Brianna's method of hiding the veggies and shamed her for it. She called her a bad mom, said she should be making those kids eat their veggies normally and only lazy parents or parents with awful kids need to go to such measures. They fought about it until Brianna told Emily to mind her own business.

But that isn't Emily and at our parents house Sunday she brought it up to shame Brianna some more. Brianna told her to mind her own business again. Then Emily said it was like something I would suggest. I told her I did. I stand by what I said too. I told her it was also none of her business. That it's not being forced on her so she needs to leave it alone. She said she would raise hell if her kids were fed that way. That she wonders what kind of daycare I work for when they don't teach kids to eat veggies. I told her she'd be one of those nightmare parents who'd expect daycare workers to stand over their kid and try to make them clear the plate or expect us to do most of the work in getting them to eat better. Emily said it's lazy. I told her she's just judgemental and she shouldn't be, because nobody can be the perfect parent, and Brianna is our sister and doesn't need to be shamed by her for feeding her kids. Emily told me I was always such a brat and I told her she was always a judgemental ass. Our parents asked Emily to leave.

Tuesday night she called and told me I had been harsh and as the eldest and my big sister, I owed her an apology for how I labelled her.

So, I (29M) leave for school and look up for my teacher. There is only me and another of my colleagues.

After a few moments, everyone starts blasting me over the phone, telling me things like: ""You're not a good team player"", ""You should have stayed and picked up the lecture's content for us"" and also calling me names. It has been going for a few hours.

For context, I have been facing serious learning disabilities my entire life and school has been the only place where I feel confortable and isolated from distractions, to learn and study. Missing class disrupts my line of though and I take a long time to catch up.

Since I don't have siblings, they thought it would be best for me to plan how we'll spend the time together.

I initially thought planning would be simple.

I suggested we each write personal letters to my mom, expressing everything we wish we could tell her, then bring them on the day we gather and burn them together ‚Äî a ritual I thought would be cathartic. Aunt Mary, though acknowledging my good intentions, disagreed, saying it felt too much like Buddhism, and she preferred to pray in her heart. She suggested Aunt Jane and I could do it without her. I assured her I respected her view and hadn't considered any religious connotations in the ritual.

Wanting all our activities to be inclusive, I proposed alternatives, like keeping the letters in a container to fill each year or having a time of silent prayer instead of writing letters. But Aunt Mary didn‚Äôt respond to these suggestions; instead, she encouraged me to keep looking for ideas online. I'm not sure if she disagreed with my other suggestions or just wanted me to figure it out on my own.

Aunt Jane is flexible and didn't have any issues with my ideas. She mentioned that Aunt Mary is more conservative and rigid, so her reaction wasn‚Äôt surprising.

Meanwhile tomorrow is my niece‚Äôs birthday and my sister (27f not the mother) said she wanted to wear it for the party last week. We usually wear each other‚Äôs clothes but I told her no, not just because i already said i‚Äôd give it to my best friend but also because i knew it‚Äôd be too small for her cause she‚Äôs a size bigger than me. She asked two more times, and I explained why I told her not to wear it.

This morning i came out of the shower and i saw her trying on the dress (shocker, it didn‚Äôt fit!) i got mad and asked her why she wore it when i told her not to and she started acting like i wasn‚Äôt making sense, saying things like ‚Äúi just took a bath it‚Äôs not like i‚Äôm going to get it dirty.‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the matter if i just try it on‚Äù

I (20f) bought an expensive dress a while back, but gained weight before it could arrive so I decided to gift it to my best friend- she legit married and now lives in a different state so I wanted to take it to her when I went to visit next month.

She asked two more times, and I explained why I told her not to wear it.

This morning i came out of the shower and i saw her trying on the dress (shocker, it didn‚Äôt fit!) i got mad and asked her why she wore it when i told her not to and she started acting like i wasn‚Äôt making sense, saying things like ‚Äúi just took a bath it‚Äôs not like i‚Äôm going to get it dirty.‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the matter if i just try it on‚Äù

60,1esy4r1,AITA for questioning my fianc√©e's boundaries on overnight stays w/ family & friends,"
Me (f24) and my partner (m24) have moved to Australia for a year. Two of my best friends (called O and S) moved out here 4 years ago, and I haven‚Äôt seen either in a couple years. I‚Äôve known them since high school- where me and my partner met, therefore he knows them but they‚Äôve never been super close.

We plan to meet O and S for a weekend and I suggested  that we should ask them and their partners if they‚Äôd like to share an Airbnb for the weekend- having our own rooms obviously. Also, once we settle down in this country we don‚Äôt plan on living in the same city as O and S, so I wouldn‚Äôt be seeing them often.

My partner does not want to share an Airbnb with my friends and their partners. He likes his own space and would feel uncomfortable sharing a space with their partners as he doesn‚Äôt really know them (we have only met O‚Äôs partner this week and never met S‚Äôs partner). He said he would meet them during the day for activities and dinner, but would like to go back to our own place at night.

I do admit that his firm no upset me a little. For some context, this is something that has come up in our relationship a lot, especially in the last year as we moved into our own place together. He did not like guests in our flat. If any of my friends would come over (which was rarely) I would try meet them outside the flat as he would discourage me from inviting them over- and if they did come over he would leave the house before they got there and stay out for the duration. My family also lived far away but only my sister ever stayed the night once, and my partner left the house while she was there. He does not like going on holiday with my family, or staying with my parents when we visit them (2 hours drive away).

As you can guess- this quickly turned into an argument. As best as I can- I will bullet point our main arguments. 

His points:
‚Ä¢ He is upset I questioned his answer when he told me no- he is uncomfortable with staying with people he doesn‚Äôt really know. 
‚Ä¢ This is a boundary he believes is important, he values his space and time. 
‚Ä¢ That I put my family and friends above him. 
‚Ä¢ He is not going to change- this is who he is.
‚Ä¢ If I don‚Äôt accept that he is like this- and it is too much for me to deal with, I should break off the relationship now. 

My points:
‚Ä¢ I rarely see my friends since they moved abroad. He does occasionally stay with my family (and has been on holiday with them before) and I‚Äôve had the same friends since high school so I genuinely didn‚Äôt know what his answer would be.
‚Ä¢ I don‚Äôt put my friends and family above him- I compromise a lot.
‚Ä¢ Instead of breaking up, he should work on trying to fix this issue as I don‚Äôt think this is healthy. 

Am I the asshole? I‚Äôm obviously not going to ask my friends anymore if they‚Äôd like to share an Airbnb. Any help is appreciated- I really don‚Äôt want us to break up over this. ",Asshole,2024-08-15,"AITA for questioning my fianc√©e's boundaries on overnight stays w/ family & friends

My roomate is demanding she pay 1/3 of out power bill because of this and part of her rent. Keep in mind my gf buys her own food for the apartment and doesn‚Äôt eat anything but that, while my roomate has said she wants to split groceries and made it clear not to use her food whenever she has been over its been with friends or a hookup.

Shes using the place like a sex house and notting more, the friends also ate a number of snacks and had around 6 drinks but her logic is ‚Äú i didnt drink them so im not laying her back. 

She constantly hides behind her mom saying shes gonna call her to deal with it and anytime we set a day for all 3 of us to sit down and talk about her issue she locks herself in her room. 

School starts soon and we are grown ass ppl (20) so idk why she can‚Äôt act like it and talk to me instead of whine at me over text.

Edit: ok apparently i wasn‚Äôt clear we don‚Äôt split the cost for food she buys her food and i buy mine because she only what‚Äôs hot pockets and microwave food whereas i cook.

62,1esxi7v,AITA for telling my family no more to monthly family dinners?,"Ever since my dad was a kid our family has done monthly family dinners, nicer ones than your average family dinner. It's something our family did when my siblings and I were kids too. We'd have grandparents over and we'd all have a nicer dinner together. When my siblings and I grew up we still did it only instead of what happened before, where branches broke off over time and did their own, they decided we should include partners/spouses and our kids as a whole in one. By the time I was 19 the family had decided they would take turns hosting each month to lessen the burden.

My wife was excited to be a part of them at first. We started during our relationship. I did the cooking to start and then she took over after a while because she wanted to. My family had seemingly got along with my wife before this point but they were overly harsh of her cooking (with the exception of my two younger siblings). She tried to make them happy but no dice. I told them they could be kinder. They said she should cook better or cook different things. My wife didn't make anything they don't eat. But nothing was right. She grew frustrated and I grew suspicious. 

So we hosted a couple of months ago and I told my wife we were going to pretend I did the cooking. Just to see. She told me she felt like they just weren't fond of her food. I pointed out nobody had the same amount of complaints as them and they even criticized the steak and potatoes they all seemed to go crazy for. She went along with the plan and when my family thought I'd cooked it? They loved it. Said it was so good my wife had decided to let a real talent take over. That it was so nice to have something a little different (curry) and all this very lovely stuff. My younger brother and sister weren't fooled. But they enjoyed watching the rest of the family dig a hole. When the rest of my family heard it was my wife's food and not mine? They tried so hard to backtrack on all the nice stuff. The rest of the dinner went in tense silence and my wife's eyes were opened. I told her I was done with these dinners and she was my priority. She felt a little bad. I told her we could have dinners with my younger brother and sister sometimes. It's less stress anyway.

When we didn't show up to last months dinner or this one, my parents and siblings started asking questions. I told them each time we weren't going again but missing two made it sink in. They told me we need to be there. I said never again. My wife doesn't deserve their disrespect. I told them they ruined what they wanted by being assholes to her. They said I was overreacting, making very relationship harming choices, and treating them badly for simply having issues with my wife's food. They also said to think of future kids and how they'll miss out. Some of it got to my wife a little which I have tried to reassure her about.

63,1esx08l,AITA for not walking the dog? ,"
My sister got a dog when she was 18 and failed to take care of him, leaving it to my mom‚Äôs responsibility. 

My mom LOVES her dog like he‚Äôs her child. She will diligently walk him for hours and let him lead. 

 I don‚Äôt mind walking him when I feel the urge. 

But I‚Äôm not a dog person. I don‚Äôt have a dog for this reason. I have two cats, which my mom also helps to take care of along with her cat (feeding if I‚Äôm not up yet, or when I go to work, etc.). I recently moved back home after being out of the house for 3 years. 

My mom recently developed knee pain and works part time. I work full time in a demanding job, and I am trying to work on mental health struggles. 

As long as he has been here, he has never been *my* dog, I‚Äôm the dog‚Äôs aunt/sister as it‚Äôs called by my family. 

I love him lots, but I‚Äôm just not a dog person. I can‚Äôt do the upkeep right now, and have just never bonded with dogs like I do cats. 

My mom will lose track of time or come home from working tired and ask me if I would do her the favour of walking the dog. 

I will do it if I have to (if he will not get a walk without me), but it‚Äôs not typically something I WANT to do. Her dog is a bit spoiled and will pull, expect me to follow him and I just often don‚Äôt have the energy with my mental health. 

She will take him out, but will be upset that I didn‚Äôt do it immediately when she asks. 

I feel for her, because it‚Äôs the responsibility even if she is tired. I want to help, but I also just don‚Äôt feel up to it if for example, I‚Äôve worked a 12 hour shift and she worked 6, then comes home not feeling up to it. 

It makes me feel guilty when she asks, and I am obviously reluctant. I want to help, but I‚Äôm also dealing with my own things and find it a struggle to bring up the motivation when she asks for the favour. I just want to know if I‚Äôm being an asshole by not walking the dog? 

EDIT: For some clarity. My mom will walk her dog most of the time often for 2-3 hours then additional smaller walks (that are usually like 45 min). I am NOT saying she *never walks the dog.* 

I am also *not* saying that I would *never* walk the dog. 

People were mentioning rent. Yes, I pay rent, share bills. I pay for the food box deliveries and cook the food. I also share with the household chores. 

I‚Äôll give a couple examples of situations that I mean. 

1.  I got up at 5 am to go to work 7-7:30. Got home at 7:45, fed the cats and got settled at around 8.  My mom got off work and home at 8:10. She comes home and asks me to do her a favour and walk the dog cause her knee was sore. I was obviously tired and reluctant but said that I would. My mom asks me a few questions about my day (which I was exhausted) then goes upstairs and I hear the leash clip and she walks out with the dog. Comes back and I told her I just needed a moment but I was going to do it. She told me she needed it done now (when she asked) cause she was tired too and wanted to go to bed. 

2. We both had the morning off today, I had an appointment at 1 for a psychiatrist appointment I was anxiously waiting for - for a while now. We both went back to our rooms to have our coffees. She had an appointment at 1100 and at 10:20 she says she spent too long having her coffee and asked me to walk the dog, saying he gives her a hard time about short walks too. I said okay, but he does give me a hard time too. She said fine - then went to walk the dog. ",Asshole,2024-08-15,"AITA for not walking the dog?

64,1eswbks,AITA for telling my parents they owe my husband a real and heartfelt apology to my husband if they ever want to be invited to anything?,"I (27f) met my husband Jamie (27m) in high school. He was the boy with the bad reputation for dumb shit, and by dumb shit I mean, not stuff he did but stuff he didn't do, like going home or having an adult around him. His mom was an addict who didn't let him come home before 12am on any given night. So he'd spend his time in different places which made adults think poorly of him. By the time people realized it was because he had a crappy mother they judged him for her actions. My parents were some of those judgemental people. They'd see him out past dark and make comments.

They were awful when Jamie and I started dating. I told them they considered themselves Christian and should be more understanding and welcoming of someone who didn't have a good home life. They'd say he wasn't trying, like he could do anything about his mom. They judged him for not going to college. They deemed him lazy for not going even though he held a job until he was 14 and with the help of the couple he'd worked for, went to trade school.

My parents were so shitty about it all that we didn't talk for a whole year. Then they reached out via my siblings to apologize to me and they appeared to accept Jamie and realize they had been wrong about him. Jamie always got along with my siblings. But he started to get along with my parents too and it was nice.

We got married two years ago and we welcomed our first baby together in June.

Last month we had a big fight. They showed that they kept their opinions to themselves for this long but they never saw Jamie as a good person, they always saw him as trash. And it all started because Jamie was alone with the baby for an entire day and they were horrified I trusted him to watch our child without me there. They spewed such hateful things about Jamie that aren't true. He's an amazing dad and husband. He's not his mother. He has never been in trouble with the law. So the fact they spoke about him like he was some criminal? I was so pissed. I kicked them out and told them I was done with them. 

We're still good with my siblings which is where this post is taking us. We started talking Christmas and Jamie and I said we'd host them. My mom was trying to get my siblings to ask me if I'd come to Christmas dinner at their house with the baby. One sibling said Jamie and I were hosting. Upon learning that my mom took said siblings phone and called and asked me how I could leave them uninvited. I told her if they ever want to be invited to anything again they will truly reflect on their actions and words and make a real and heartfelt apology to Jamie. But that is the only way. And it has to be real and to him and not me. I then hung up on my mom.

My parents are now claiming I'm trying to blackmail them, which I don't think they truly know what that means. And a text (I assume is from mom) accused me of being disrespectful of my parents and saying you can't demand an apology.

65,1esw58f,WIBTA in this scenario,"Me (37M) and my friend (34F) have known each other for 10 years and have talked every day for the past month.

Yesterday, she called me after midnight and said I sounded too tired and like I didn't want to talk anymore. I called her back and said her call had woken me up, but that didn't mean I didn't want to talk.

This somehow turned into an argument (as it usually does when she wakes me up, because I think she thinks I'm upset; I'm still not sure why). She had went to the store at 8:30 and said she'd call in an hour. A quarter after 11, I still hadn't heard from her, so I called. She said she was out with a friend getting food. She called back after midnight.

She said she didn't need to check in with me. I said that's entirely NOT the point, and I don't expect her to check in, but if she said she's going to do something, I'm going to expect her to do it, and that a text would've been fine, because in the past, that's what she's done: if she's late, she'd let me know.

She's hyperfocused on this supposed ""need"" I have and I feel like she's starting to think I'm controlling, despite me telling her that's not why I called her back. I called her back because I wanted to talk because I missed her that day.

But maybe I'm wrong? WIBTA for having that expectation, even though that's not what this was about?

67,1esvbit,AITA for not caring about my birthday?,"I (M) recently turned 25 on Sunday. I don't really celebrate my birthday, usually I'll meet up with a few friends and get wasted but no parties, never expecting birthday wishes aside from a select few like my Grand dad or my Mum. 

Now, AITA for this. The day before my birthday, my aunt hosted her 60th birthday party and my cousin and I drove through to attend (Him and I are roommates). Already I didn't want to attend since I originally planned to head to my hometown to spend the weekend with my dogs, whom I don't see often but love to death since I've put so much time into raising them. And also knew based on past experience that I would sit around doing not much since I dont really enjoy ""partying with my family"". We love each other but I'm the stoner/gamer/otaku/metalhead/black sheep of the family. They're drinkers who watch sport and listen to Gospel, we just don't click. Needless to say I wasn't looking forward to the Sunday Bday.  
  
We get there, greeted the 50+ family members, had a few ciders and then I wanted to go home around 10 pm ( 1H20 min drive home ) but everyone kept telling us ""You're not heading anywhere"". I had a really bad drunk car crash last year so perhaps they were being cautions. 

The night dragged on, I found a couch to sleep on and called it a night, didn't even bother ""waiting until 12 so everyone can wish me"" thing. First thing next morning, my mom and some aunts started wishing me and sang. After saying thank you I told them that we're leaving. Not in a rude way but more like a ""thanks so much everyone, well, we're heading out now"" and left without greeting except for the few who were there in the room.

I get home and I could tell from texts that my mom was disappointed in me leaving the family on my bday to head home. Me on the other hand didn't want a celebration and honestly regretted giving up a weekend to basically just show face. None of the fam who was there wished me throughout the day, not sursprised nor was I bothered. But a small part feels like I was an AH to them who wanted to share the day with me.

I can go into more context, but tell me reddit. AITA? and if so please elaborate XD

Yesterday after work, I took my mom to the grocery store to get school lunch items. When we got home, my s/o offered to unload the groceries and told us to go inside. I put away the groceries he brought in, and we finished our evening.

This morning, while packing lunches before taking my mom to her port surgery across town, I noticed some items missing. I checked my trunk and found a bag of refrigerated items that had been left overnight. I texted my s/o, asking him to replace the items since I couldn't today.

He denied leaving the bag and got angry when I asked him to replace the items, saying it was unfair and that he shouldn‚Äôt be held accountable. He then said it was my fault, I should have noticed and he wouldn‚Äôt help unload groceries anymore.

**Update: He bought replacement groceries. He originally offered to post this situation on Reddit to see who the AH was.

I (29F) and my now ex boyfriend (32M) have been together for 5 years and agreed to get married. Time for some backstory.

Me and my boyfriend met at a bar and we immediately hit it off. We texted and went on dates for about 2 months. What i didn't know back then, he had a girlfriend (22F) of his own who didn't know about us and the same thing for me. So after 2 years i got suspicious that my boyfriend is always away every other night. I am the financially stable and supporting him instead of him supporting me. He talked to me about wanting to be a house husband and always trying to practice cooking. He insisted on it.

Fast fowarding to 2 later he finally agreed to get a job but was a bit moody after coming back from his job (a teacher) i work for finance btw. And i talked him to not get moody and god did it feel like i was talking to a 5 year old to not suck his thumb. He eventually did get better but stopped having any sexual things weekly and now its a more of a once a month thing. I did feel bad the first month getting rejected by him but from this year we planned things out and it got better. But back to his girlfriend, what his girlfriend explained to me is what I'll continue with. He got into an argument with her and threw a tantrum, so thats why this year he respected me and made love with me. 

Four Weeks ago. Or what felt like four weeks. We were supposed to have a wedding but!
I got a text from a random girl on facebook which i didn't know. She told me that my boyfriend had been cheating on her with me from the start of my relationship with her. She broke up with him after finding out about our relationship and wedding. She called me alot of bad stuff for getting with him from the first place. So i did something i think i shouldn't have done, stupid. I told my boyfriend and he denying everything about that but i can tell from his voice he was lying. I broke down crying and went to my parents house. I told them i wanted to cancel my wedding for this. They yelled at me, because i told my parents they should do some planning for the wedding because i was bad at that. And i think this is where i think I'm the asshole. My parents had been planning my wedding for about 7 months (december) and so did my boyfriends family. I told them to quiet down and not yell at me, they definitely had enough of me and decided to not talking to me for the whole day. Btw the whole wedding would've costed me around 50k which my parents aren't contributing to. Just me and my boyfriend.

Alot of people those including half my family and all his family are calling me names because my boyfriend spread lies that i left him because of 'money issues' as i said I'm financially stable and doesn't need to have a man support me in anyway, just need a man with a job so they can at least take care of themselves instead of me taking care of a man that doesn't do shit.

They yelled at me, because i told my parents they should do some planning for the wedding because i was bad at that. And i think this is where i think I'm the asshole. My parents had been planning my wedding for about 7 months (december) and so did my boyfriends family. I told them to quiet down and not yell at me, they definitely had enough of me and decided to not talking to me for the whole day. Btw the whole wedding would've costed me around 50k which my parents aren't contributing to. Just me and my boyfriend.

Alot of people those including half my family and all his family are calling me names because my boyfriend spread lies that i left him because of 'money issues' as i said I'm financially stable and doesn't need to have a man support me in anyway, just need a man with a job so they can at least take care of themselves instead of me taking care of a man that doesn't do shit. 

Am i the asshole for cancelling my own wedding for a cheater or am i overreacting?",0.0,0.013997635804116726,0,1
75,1estxgx,AITA for telling my wife I hate her fridgescaping,"Recently my wife has taken to ""fridgescaping,"" I guess it's a recent trend because I'd never heard about it before this. She started decorating our fridge and it was really getting on my nerves, for example she put flowers in the fridge, in vases, in front of food so you have to move things just to get to the food. She put all our food in fancy baskets, jars, and similar things. I know it sounds absurd but if you just search up ‚Äúfridgescaping‚Äù you‚Äôll see what I‚Äôm talking about.

I didn‚Äôt care at first because I don‚Äôt have to use the fridge much anyways, I don‚Äôt cook a lot. But she‚Äôs getting too meticulous with it and adding too much decor. It‚Äôs made the fridge very uninviting for me. She gets upset when I get something from the fridge and don‚Äôt put things back perfectly. She keeps taking it as a personal slight and acts like I‚Äôve done something to deliberately hurt her, when I haven‚Äôt, I just find it unnecessary to maintain such an organized fridge. Before she started this it would take me 30 seconds to grab something quick from the fridge whereas now it‚Äôs a whole ordeal

Last weekend she confronted me after I grabbed some leftovers from the fridge and left it in ‚Äúdisarray‚Äù according to her. I explained how I find the hobby stupid  and she can decorate other things, it doesn‚Äôt have to be the fridge. It gets in the way when I want to quickly eat, when I come home from work hungry and tired and want to grab a quick bite it‚Äôs frustrating. I also talked to my son about it, and he finds it annoying, which I told her. She didn‚Äôt argue back after that, and she‚Äôs removed all of the decorations from the fridge, which I have to admit has been relieving. But she‚Äôs also been acting very distant towards me and just hasn't been herself, and has been weird intimacy-wise.

The first night, my boyfriend slept over at my place and we celebrated. The following morning was nice but he was down emotionally.

After the day was over I was exhausted, he got on this emotional roller coaster about ‚Äúbeing sad about being sad‚Äù and attempting to cheer him up at each quarter of the day took a lot out of me. The next day they texted and said in short ‚Äúsorry for being tough yesterday, and I‚Äôm really grateful for you but you didn‚Äôt post me on your Instagram story to say happy birthday‚Äù

We had an argument, a small fight about it because it made me feel hurt.

81,1esrvis,AITA for throwing a gift from my dad's wife in the trash before I moved out of their house?,"I (18M) moved out of my dad's house last month, the day I turned 18. I no longer live in the same town and instead I moved in with three of my friends who are starting college next month and I'm about to start trade school. I'm working until trade school starts to afford rent and food. The four of us are splitting the cost between us. I did not take money from my dad. The day I left my dad's wife gave me this photo album, saying it was a growing up gift. This photo album was photos of the 7 years since she and my dad married. I did not appreciate the gift, nor did I want it, which I told her to her face. She told me to take it and I should have family photos when I moved out. Before I left I threw the album into the trash.

To explain why I did this, what the background is. When I was 10 my mom died. She had an allergic reaction while we were out for a celebratory dinner for my dad and she died on the way to the hospital. Mom was the glue that held us together. Dad and I were never very close before she died. But six weeks later my dad had already met his wife and they boxed up all of my mom's things, clothes, jewelry, photos of her, her phone, keys, anything that was just hers, and they brought it to the dump. I never got anything and neither did any of her family. I was furious and I will never forgive my dad for what he did. The very next day he moved that woman in. They were married 4 months later. Had a small but still an actual formal wedding. They dragged me to it and pretended everything was fine and normal. She even gave a speech about being so excited to have a son of her own and all the ""adventures we'll have together"".

When I was 12 I got copies of a couple of photos of mom from extended family and put them in my room. Dad's wife found the photos and she removed them saying I didn't need those and I'd bring everyone down having them in the house. I yelled at her, cursed at her, wished her dead and erased and my dad yelled at me for disrespecting his wife. I told him that day I wish he'd died instead of my mom. He told me he wished he'd let my grandparents take me after the fight they had about mom's stuff going to the dump. I told him I wish he had.

The 7 years of living with the two of them were hell. I'm so glad I'm gone. I have no respect for either of them and I don't care that my dad lost someone too. He threw her away and not just from him.

After I settled in my apartment dad suddenly remembered my number for the first time in three years and called me out for upsetting and disrespecting his wife by throwing her gift away. He told me she did it out of love. I ignored it. She sent me a text on dad's phone telling me I should be surrounded by happy family memories which was why she made the album. I sent a photo of my room which has photos of my mom, ones I got copies of. That was the only reply I made.

Basically, the whole senior grade is planning a party out of town a couple of nights prior to the school year's start. The cost to attend it is very high (2 whole shifts at work).

My best friend, also almost 17f, really wants to go because both of us didn't really attend any parties in high school so far and want to experience at least one at some point. Keep in mind that her parents are very strict, and we both are studying for the SAT exam (taking it the day after school starts.) Also let it be known, that I'm very much so not the party type, and prefer low-key hangouts and stuff like that.

I told her that I think I'm not gonna attend this one, and probably will go to the next. She understandably asked why and I explained:

1. It costs a lot of money and this month I already have a LOT of expenses going out (I'm buying a camera which has been my dream for like 10 years, and she knows that, and the very expensive price) and I can't allow myself to spend lots more money on this party when I already am investing so much into this purchase.

2. The SAT exam is a couple of days later, and I want to make sure that I spend every last moment making sure I'm ready, and since this party is gonna be a couple of days prior and I probably won't be home until the middle of the night or early morning, I will have to spend the rest of the next day sleeping because I'll be tired, and this is definitely messing up with studying (and for the next few days I'll still be tired).

3. I honestly think that with the type of party-like stuff that my grade has thrown in the past, I won't enjoy it very much and right now when I have other priorities I definitely rather do more important things, rather than go to a party I probably won't enjoy when there are other important things going on that are more of a priority for me. + Again, I'm not a party person and she knows.

She said that she wants to have fun, and wants to try partying and that I would be a party-pooper if I don't come cause then her parents would never let her go and she'll be scared of creeps in my grade doing anything to her.

Obviously I get the concern 100%, but I believe that right now it's not a time that I can afford (both financially and mentally) to go to this party. I understand her perspective but she has more friends that she can go with if she wants to go, and obviously I don't want to limit her from going wherever she wants cause it's her life and she can live it however she likes.

She replied that she won't be able to go and said that all of my reasons are excuses I'm making to not go, but they genuinely are what I took into consideration when deciding that I'll not go. For the rest of the day, she froze me out completely.

85,1esr4ch,WIBTA to skip lunch after my friend's husband made comments about my illness?,"Throwaway account. I'm 41F.

As a kid my family lived in a small town in Southern OH. My dad died suddenly and mom relocated us to FL where her family is. We stayed in touch with friends from there, a pair of siblings Anna (now 44F) and May (now 42F).

My mom owns a second home in FL. Every summer Anna visits with her husband and son and stays there. May has stayed with her family too occasionally, as has their mom Janet.

A few years ago Anna went NC with her mom over what seems like a weird disagreement to me and became extremely close to my mom - they now talk every day. About 18 months ago, my mom and Janet also went NC after having a disagreement they were then too proud to work out.

Well before all this family drama I had left FL and worked my way up to a senior position in a globally known company in a field that Anna is passionate about but never pursued. Unfortunately I've struggled with chronic health issues all my life and they came to a head while working there. I had to leave my job and move back to FL and take time out to recuperate.

Better now, I work in the same field with a company that is prestigious here but not a globally recognizable one. The year after my return, Anna and her family visited. Anna's husband said, ""It's a bit of a step down from your old job, isn't it?""

I've since travelled a lot for my job, with sporadic posts on social media that I guess they've seen (my posts are more of a journal for myself). There were some comments from Anna during their visits to FL that seemed disingenuous from the tone. (""You're travelling a lot aren't you?"" etc.)

Last year when they visited I was very ill again, and bedridden when they came to my mom's house to see us.

A few months ago I had to go to Southern OH for work and I posted a picture to social media, just documenting as usual. Anna, who never likes or comments on my posts, liked it. I immediately sensed it to be quite passive aggressive. I sent her a DM and asked how she was and told her I was there for 2 days for work and wouldn't be able to meet but was looking forward to see her when she'd be coming out to FL. May ended up liking the picture too; I DMed her also.

Anna and her family are in FL right now. When I greeted them, only her husband said hi. Anna initially blanked me and I had to say hello to her 4 times before she acknowledged me - she said she was distracted by her children. Later on her husband asked me how my health is. When I was answering, he interrupted me to make some jokes about my health issues, which I found to be in really poor taste. I'd rather not say the exact joke, but it was like making a bald joke to a cancer patient's face, it was that direct and crass.

I left them alone for the rest of the evening and didn't say goodbye when they left.

They are coming back tomorrow for lunch but I intend to leave the house. Depending on how petty I'm feeling I might leave as they arrive and if they ask why I will tell them why I'm leaving.

86,1esqjzo,AITA for using my veto on my wife's favorite name because it was my sister's birth name?,"My wife's #1 girl name is Josephine nn Josie Joy. She wanted it to be our daughter's name, telling me it felt just right for our girl.

The name Josephine has a not so great history in my family. My (bio) parents fostered kids and adopted some. My siblings (the kids who were adopted) all had their own pasts but I have a sister who now has a different name, who was Josephine at the time of her birth and it was her name until she was 6 when the name was changed before my parents legally adopted her. It was a very complicated process for my sister's name to be changed. There was a childhood psychologist, a trauma therapist and a psychiatrist involved in stating that it was in her best interest for the name to be changed because of the trauma she had surrounding her name. For context she was 5 when she was removed from her birth family and has memories of them using her name. They also called her Josie.

My sister still has some trouble with the name. But she only hears it occasionally. She never tells people to use another name. But our family knows that it can trigger some memories for her and unpleasant feelings (putting it mildly). She is still in therapy. But this isn't something that is hugely controlling her life. But there's a difference between hearing it occasionally to hearing it all the time because someone in the family has that name. My wife knows it *was* my sisters name but not everything about the trauma surrounding it. She knows it was bad enough for professionals to get involved to help her get the name formally changed. But doesn't know the details I know about why. I also won't share it all here because that's my sisters story, not mine.

So I told my wife that I was vetoing Josephine and Josie Joy. I told her it wasn't a name I could live with knowing it would remind my sister of her trauma. That I also had a very negative association because of my sisters past with it. My wife was disappointed and asked if we could talk to my sister about it first. I told her my sister would give us her blessing so she wouldn't burden us but I would feel horrifically guilty.

She said okay it and we have a short list of other names now. But she had talked about the name enough that her family were calling our daughter Josephine already. When my wife said Josephine wasn't the name they asked why and she told them a name should be agreed on by both and we weren't on the same page so we'd choose one we both loved equally. My wife's parents took me aside and asked me why I would deny my wife this name when it means so much to her. They said we could have worked on a middle name I loved. I told them the name had a bad history for me and I couldn't get past it. They told me I was being selfish. When I talked to my wife about it, she told me she wished I could have done more to try and make it work but she'd talk to her parents and tell them to back off.

He never went over to her house so I have never met her parents, she is at our house every day after school. Alice is a pretty sweet girl in my opinion, she's respectful and a good house guest, cleans up after herself and holds good conversation. 

Over the years I have to come to think of her as my own daughter. She sometimes talks about her ""kind of poor"" relationship with her mom and says they aren't very close. Upon investigating my son mentioned she's really afraid of her mother and doesn't like to go home.

Yesterday, their school put up their yearly annual performance. They have 3 sections: acting, dancing and singing. Students opt for which they want to be a part of.

Alice picked singing, she said it was because she doesn't like dancing and doesn't want to be seen my too many people, and she likes how she can be in a crowd while singing. My son and I think she has a nice voice.

My husband and I were at the performance, we took videos of both our son and Alice in the performance. After the performance I was looking for my son but couldn't find him. He said Alice was crying and they would be late.

I asked him why and he said she was upset her mother didn't come. Apparently the mother said she didn't want to sit for 3 hours to watch her daughter sing when dancing brings more attention and looks better. 

I didn't mention anything to Alice or my son, dropped Alice home and when we got in, I sent an anonymous message telling Alice's mom how shameful it was that she wouldn't come watch her daughter do something she was proud of, and I thought she didn't deserve to have a kid like that.

I am pregnant, so I woke up feeling bad that it was hormones making me too protective of Alice. My husband, however, believes that it was rational.

its okay a new day is a new day and i dont want to do anything to add to your current situation but i also dont want to do things i dont want to do just because it might help, i feel like we‚Äôre too early on and theres a big part of me that wants to but i also know i need to cut off the parts of me that are people pleasing due to previous trauma and thats how i feel. i genuinely hate that youre going through it right now and i feel awful about it but at this point in the relationship i cant let it effect how im doing and i have to make an intentional effort to stray away from my previous tendencies because it doesnt do anything good for anyone long term, even if it might help short term

did i do something wrong to share my emotional state with my partner at the time? AITA?",4.0,1.063559651374817,1,0

Today my grandfather asked me if I could help him out tomorrow. We've got more trash than usually cause I just bought myself a new bed, so we need to get rid of the old one and the packaging of the new one along with some other things. 

I live in Austria and we have those public dumpster places where you can take basically any trash that isn't fit for a usual trashcan and it gets recycled there. I don't know the english word for it though. 

So he asked me, if I could accompany him there. He would drive since his car is bigger than mine and we can fit more stuff in it. I would do the rest, meaning getting the stuff in and out of the car. 

Here's the thing: I'm allergic to bees and wasps and there's an ungodly amount of them at this recycling station/dumpster place during summer. I made it clear at the start of summer that I wouldn't accompany him there anymore until the temperatures drop and less of them are there. 

He asked me anyway, since my mother and half-brother are both busy and I refused. Now he is mad at me and I'm not sure if I'm in the right here, since my allergy isn't that severe (yet) and I could make an exception.

97,1esodon,AITA for telling my mom that my brother‚Äôs wife is ruining our family trip?,"My big brother, his wife, family, aunts, uncles, and I all came to visit my mom for her birthday. We took time off and gathered for a week and a half, which was rare since we hadn‚Äôt all been together in about 20 years. However, my brother‚Äôs wife is getting on my nerves. She doesn‚Äôt seem to enjoy being around us. When we make plans, she leaves hours before and returns late, making us wait and ruining the schedule.

For example, yesterday, my younger brother, who lives here, took a day off to take us all swimming at 10:30 am. Everyone was ready, except my brother‚Äôs wife. She knew we were leaving at 10:30, but said she‚Äôd be back quickly. By 1:30 pm, she still wasn‚Äôt back. I was upset we had to wait. I asked my mom why she couldn‚Äôt meet us there, but she said it would make my brother feel bad, and they‚Äôd probably fight. So, we waited. My brother, who planned the day, and I were both upset because it was getting late, and the drive was long.

She finally arrived at 2 pm, and we had to change plans because the lake would close at 6 pm, leaving us with little time. We ended up hanging out at a less-than-ideal park because there weren‚Äôt any dog-friendly swimming areas nearby. My younger brother said if we were late the next day, he‚Äôd rather stay home. I agreed, and so did everyone else, but we couldn‚Äôt say it in front of my sister-in-law.

Today, we had plans for 4 pm as soon as my younger brother got off work. However, my sister-in-law is out again with her kids and will be late as usual. I couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore and expressed my frustration to my mom and some family. We came from far for a rare trip where we could finally be together, and some of us aren‚Äôt getting paid to be away. I don‚Äôt get to see my family often and don‚Äôt want my younger brother to feel excluded because he‚Äôs fed up with making plans we‚Äôre always late for.

My mom said, ‚ÄúWhat do you want me to do? I can‚Äôt control her.‚Äù I acknowledged that, but pointed out she could‚Äôve reminded her about our plans.

My big brother, his wife, family, aunts, uncles, and I all came to visit my mom for her birthday. We took time off and gathered for a week and a half, which was rare since we hadn‚Äôt all been together in about 20 years. However, my brother‚Äôs wife is getting on my nerves. She doesn‚Äôt seem to enjoy being around us. When we make plans, she leaves hours before and returns late, making us wait and ruining the schedule.

For example, yesterday, my younger brother, who lives here, took a day off to take us all swimming at 10:30 am. Everyone was ready, except my brother‚Äôs wife. She knew we were leaving at 10:30, but said she‚Äôd be back quickly. By 1:30 pm, she still wasn‚Äôt back. I was upset we had to wait. I asked my mom why she couldn‚Äôt meet us there, but she said it would make my brother feel bad, and they‚Äôd probably fight. So, we waited. My brother, who planned the day, and I were both upset because it was getting late, and the drive was long.

She finally arrived at 2 pm, and we had to change plans because the lake would close at 6 pm, leaving us with little time. We ended up hanging out at a less-than-ideal park because there weren‚Äôt any dog-friendly swimming areas nearby. My younger brother said if we were late the next day, he‚Äôd rather stay home. I agreed, and so did everyone else, but we couldn‚Äôt say it in front of my sister-in-law.

Today, we had plans for 4 pm as soon as my younger brother got off work. However, my sister-in-law is out again with her kids and will be late as usual. I couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore and expressed my frustration to my mom and some family. We came from far for a rare trip where we could finally be together, and some of us aren‚Äôt getting paid to be away. I don‚Äôt get to see my family often and don‚Äôt want my younger brother to feel excluded because he‚Äôs fed up with making plans we‚Äôre always late for.

My mom said, ‚ÄúWhat do you want me to do? I can‚Äôt control her.‚Äù I acknowledged that, but pointed out she could‚Äôve reminded her about our plans.

Other odd behaviours include:

- coming to us asking if we‚Äôd seen a woman walking around her side of the house who supposedly had been yelling and banging on her door, and supposedly dug holes in her backyard (we share a backyard, no one is ever back there)

I get to his apartment and he comes down to help take everything up to his floor. He told me on the way up that the maintenance man was there to fix some thing. Cool. Right? Wrong! So they're talking about football and I started to cook dinner. Maintenance guy is there, long enough for me to make the hamburger for tacos, then he leaves. I asked for the strainer for the hamburger meat. He stands up off the couch and says ‚ÄúI hate that you're being pushy.‚Äù I was like what are you talking about?

I told him he was talking to the maintenance guy that I figured I would get started because I had worked eight hours and was starving because I hadn't eaten all day. So I go and sit down. I‚Äôm crying at this point. 

Then he hand me the remote as I'm sitting on the couch and said here change the channel since you don't like MMA. Then he said let me turn down my music since you don't like it loud. I said this is your house you can do whatever. He blares his music on the fourth floor of his apartment building and I KNOW that people all around him can hear it. You can't even hear the TV over the music. You can‚Äôt even think straight cause it‚Äôs so loud. I just said he should turn it down some. And I don't like fighting/MMA cause I have dealt with abuse my whole life.

So I asked him if he wanted me to leave cause he just kept complaining. I thought I was doing something nice and making dinner. He said no. But then he proceeds to keep ranting at me. I got up and told him to enjoy his dinner and breakfast. I put my shoes on and left.

100,1esnlwb,AITA for refusing to share a bed on a group trip,"I (18F) am travelling with 5 other friends this December. We divided into 2 groups of three using a randomizer and booked 2 rooms. Each room has a twin bed and a queen bed, which has become a problem. I, wanting my own bed, talked to my roommates about having the twin and them sharing the queen. One roommate was okay with it, but X also wanted her own bed. So, in our group discussion, I asked the other room how they were planning to split their beds, and they had all decided on who was getting the twin. I asked the person with the twin if they would rather have a queen, they said no, and I left it at that.

Fast forward to a few days later, I mention to X that we haven't yet decided on a bed situation. She said that she needed it more, because she was uncomfortable having to share a bed, considering she never had to do that before. I said I didn't like sharing a bed either. Basically, since we both wanted it, we decided the best way to split it was rock paper scissors. I won, so I got the twin bed.

She has been crying to our entire friend group about how unfair it is since then. They all know it was decided by RPS, so everybody agrees that it's fair if I get the bed. However, some of them think that even if its fair that I get the bed, im being an AH by not just giving it up when she's so upset about it (she has come to me a few times, after I say im going to prioritize my own comfort, she starts crying more). Others say that she's being an AH by complaining this much after the decision is all made, and they think she's acting childish.

Edit: I just wanted to add since a lot of you are mentioning splitting the time in the bed 50/50 or getting a rollaway bed, I offered to split 50/50 even before we played RPS because I thought it was more fair, but she refused, and we decided to play RPS to choose just one person. I might still offer her 50/50 even though I won because she is being very annoying. Also, a rollaway bed costs 400$ at this hotel, and she has refused to pay the full price, given that it's a large amount. She expects me to pay half of the cost, but I refused to do that.

Edit #2: I messaged her letting her know she could just have the twin bed. I will not be rooming with her in the future though, and made sure to let her know (we have another trip planned in March). Also, decided to add that if she complained about the bed situation anymore, I would be getting my own room with roommate #3, and she would have to also get her own room. Her response:

The website asked for some personal information to set up the shop, which I added but wanted to confirm so the IRS doesn't rip me a new one.  I asked my mom where she's keeps that stuff, and she told me to wait.  She then started questioning my logic and asking why I would trust a site with such information without thinking about it more.  At this point I snapped.  I told her it's my information and I can request it whenever I want it, if it gets stolen it's my problem, not her's.  This became a yelling match which my sister interrupted.  She called me a ""man child,"" and told my mom to throw me out right then and there.  She said I don't deserve shit, and I'm being entitled.  This went on until I gave up and stormed off.  While I walked away, I over heard my sister still trying to convince my mom to kick me out.  I did not get kicked out, but it's been eating at me.

He also asked us to not tell our mom about it since she would shut the idea down as soon as she heard it.

However, when the moment arrived, my sister was bent down blowing out candles, and then we pounced and used our hands to wipe the apple pie filling and crust through her face. She didn't take it well at all. She ended up in tears, and very visibly upset by the prank. 

My dad, brother, and I didn't expect her to react this way, and I feel genuinely bad about it now. In retrospect, I'm questioning whether I should have gauged her comfort level with such pranks beforehand or if I should have opted out of the plan altogether.

107,1esmojs,AITA For going off at my boyfriend for renewing his lease?,"I '22 F' have been with my boyfriend '22 M' for 3 years now. It was a wild beginning on Hinge to where we are now.

Moving in together at 5 months (to his hometown), a cheating scandal on his end (albeit nothing physical just thru social media), a miscarriage, a break, moving together (to my home city), breaking up, getting back together but living separately, a possibility of living together again, but him deciding to move in on his own to an apartment closer to his school.

The drive is 40 minutes from him to me and he also quit his job at the beginning of the year and has had no luck finding a new one. I've been providing him with money for meals since only eats fast food and so have his parents along with them paying for his rent. (About $1300 a month) 

The move out caused a pretty big argument between us because I was under the impression that we would find a place together or move in with my parents to save money. So when he tells me his mom is coming over to help him look for apartments I was pretty upset, and even more upset when he found one and cosigned with her the same day for a 6 month lease without telling me about it. Just packing his things and moving out.

I learned to get over it and he would come over often to my parents place (where I'm staying) or drive me over to his place bc I was adamant I wouldn't since I spent the last 6 months driving over to the apartment we used to share before we broke up and got together again.

In March he explained to me that he was stressed out financially because he had already taken a loan out for his classes this semester and his parents were asking when he was getting a job since his sister would be going off to college this year and they needed to help pay for her. I told him I think it would be best for him to move with me and my parents to save money despite the drive to school being 40 mins longer. He agreed and I thought we were set on that.

Since then I've gotten a dog that is sort of ours but stays with me, and I've been counting the days till we can be together again. Until today, he told me his mom would be coming over to his apartment to help him clean. In my head it's to help him clean out the place and move stuff to storage. Then he tells me him and his mom moved the furniture around and she bought him groceries. 

I asked him what that about and he tells me that he's decided to lease the place for 6 more months and he's taken out another loan for school. I don't even know what to think anymore. I'm incredibly upset said some things and now he's not talking to me, we have a trip planned this weekend to go visit his friends and hang out with them. I love him very much but everything is just becoming too much for me. Am I being controlling or do I have a reason to be upset? 

His mom doesn't know about any of this by the way, she is a devout Christian and i feel like all of this information would make her implode.

When we were sitting around the tv my brother would just kind of bark out commands ‚Äúturn this off‚Äùand ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen this,change it‚Äù when I have the remote. I brushed it off at first as I thought he might be jet lagged or something. Today I just kind of drew the line . 

I put on something he wanted to watch and he said ‚Äúturn it up‚Äù I replied ‚Äúplease?‚Äù he said ‚Äújust turn it up,I can‚Äôt hear anything‚Äù I repeated please a few times and when he kept giving the same response and I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not just going to take orders from you‚Äù . Of course he immediately tries to make me feel bad saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a weird hill to die on‚Äù . But I just felt like it wasn‚Äôt that big of an ask. Even if he‚Äôd said it as a question or something ‚Äúcan you turn it up?‚Äù that would be fine but it doesn‚Äôt seem right to have him just barking out orders like that .",0.0,0.028767408803105354,0,1
115,1esloqj,AITA for refusing to replace $1000 worth of groceries after my tenants fridge broke?,"Hi, my name is Marcus, and I'm a landlord in Canada. Recently, one of my tenant's refrigerators, which was manufactured in 2006, broke down. It was pretty old, so it finally gave out, and unfortunately, everything in her fridge and freezer went bad. This happened over a long weekend, so there wasn't much I could do in the moment.

I offered to help by placing what I could of her groceries (like ice cream and some meat) into a freezer that I have in a shed that I‚Äôm renovating. Unfortunately, that freezer also ended up being broken, so all her stuff in there melted as well. I eventually bought a replacement fridge, but it was an older model from 2013, and it started leaking, causing another batch of her new groceries to go bad.

She now has a new fridge (which I got from another tenant in the buildings apartment who just moved out, which she was upset about seeing as it‚Äôs ‚Äúused and gross‚Äù, however it works and it‚Äôs nice.) but she‚Äôs demanding that I compensate her for $1,000 worth of groceries that were spoiled, as well as the money she had to spend on takeout for herself and her child since they had no other food and her daughter had expensive specialized food since she has issues with sensory that was lost and she now can‚Äôt buy back. I discussed the situation with a family member I work with, and we both agreed to offer her $100 in compensation, considering this situation was largely out of my control. However, she refused the $100 and said she will be contacting the Landlord and Tenant Board to seek further compensation because this is ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù.

I spoke to a buddy of mine about this, and he said I'm being an A-hole and that this was my fault, which is making me wonder if there‚Äôs more I could have done. AITA? I feel as though this was out of my control and that she‚Äôs being ungrateful seeing as I willingly offered compensation and provided her with a new fridge that she‚Äôs still complaining about in terms of use. Everyone I speak to claims I‚Äôm in the wrong but I feel I need further advice because my family says I did what I could.

EDIT: I‚Äôll speak with my relatives I share the property with regarding upping the compensation amount. To add the fridge was cleaned by the tenant who moved out, in my opinion it was clean, also it was technically a national holiday so my hands were tied.(long weekend) I spoke to her about getting renters insurance next time however she got offended. The compensation amounted of 100$ was suggested because it was meant to cover the damages regarding her insulin that needed to be refrigerated that was damaged, not the groceries itself seeing as I figured that wasn‚Äôt my fault however, I‚Äôll speak with my relatives I appreciate your opinions.

Added edit since someone asked:
First fridge broke due to age.

Second fridge which was in my shed broke prior (I thought it was just the fridge however unfortunately it was both due to age and handling when it was put into the shed) so I was unable to save any of her belongings

The third fridge broke because of the Manufacture. 

She now has a fridge that worksüëç


Last note: 

Note: it is around 1000$ in groceries she provided me the receipts. I can admit that groceries are expensive here in Canada. I‚Äôm still speaking with my relatives about this because it‚Äôs split. My uncle wants to stick to 100$ while my father is pushing for 500$. It‚Äôs truthfully not up to me.

Family values are significant in my immigrant household, and I feel my brother is deviating from these values by become more self centered while benefiting from the family‚Äôs support. This sounds bad, but hear me out. 

My brother has faced challenges since high school, including social difficulties, and these challenges got worse for him due to poor choices regarding his university and dorm. Things went from bad to worse with his struggle in college, leading him to drop out in his first year and enroll in online courses, which concerns me because it limits his social development and future job prospects.

Recently, my brother's behavior has become more problematic. He‚Äôs been spending over 10k on room renovations, engaging in risky online relationships, and exhibiting erratic behavior, including drinking alcohol at work. After my aunt complained about his behavior at the family restaurant, I called him, lost my temper, and yelled at him over the phone.
My brother likes texting. He deflects better. I couldn‚Äôt let him do that. 
When I called him, my aunt‚Äîthe one who complained‚Äîpicked up. I told her to give the phone to my brother. My brother tried to convince me it was nothing serious and I started to yell at him over the phone to the point my aunt had to interfere and tell me not to worry about it. Which made me yell even louder.
I told him how disappointed I was, to stop joking around, telling him he will be the reason the restaurant will shut down, if he cared about our family he would never do this, and basically making my opinions of his behavior known. He finally said he wouldn‚Äôt do it again and I told him bye and hung up.

Now, I feel bad. My brother is only like this because our family has been enabling him, especially when he dropped out and came home. It‚Äôs only been four months since he came home and he was already mentally struggling longer than that. Everyone struggles when making the move to university, my cousins and myself included. My brother‚Äôs case was such an unprecedented event that no one knew how to react to it. I was tired. I don‚Äôt believe my brother has hit rock bottom.

122,1eskyyt,WIBTA If I Told My Friend to Stop Talking About Race If She Can‚Äôt Stop Pursuing Her Crush?,"So I (16f), am friends with M (17f). I‚Äôm Black American and she‚Äôs Latina. Most of our conversations are usually about race, where she starts like ‚Äúblack people do this‚Äù or ‚ÄúLatinos do this‚Äù. Sometimes I do get abgry and tell her to stfu.

M told me her dad says the n word, and seemed to look at me for a reaction. The man is 300 lbs and about 6 ft, the hell am I gonna do? She‚Äôs also told one of our mutual friends that she said the n-word because some black students paid her to say it. (Okay, weird right?).

The issue I‚Äôm having now is that M likes this Latino guy, J, that says the n-word like he gets paid $100 each time he says it. When I tried to talk to him about it during lunch, he told me ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs in my language‚Äù. I tried to explain to him that the word he said is NOT (directly) in his language. He looked at me like I was a fucking alien and walked away.

During the school year she told me that he has a girlfriend, so she wasn‚Äôt interested in him anymore. I told her about the encounters right after they happened and she didn‚Äôt seem to care, but him having a girlfriend is stopping her?

I feel today was the final straw. We were talking to this girl named Lia (17f) and somehow the conversation shifted to boys. M tells us about how she likes a guy, and when my friend K said ‚Äúthe guy that said the word?‚Äù She said yeah. M proceeds to tell us about how it doesn‚Äôt matter to her - J‚Äôs ruining his own life, to which Lia says ‚Äúthat‚Äôll ruin you as well by association‚Äù. M got mad at the poor damn girl, went on a rant about how the French should be the last people talking, and said she doesn‚Äôt care, she‚Äôs just waiting for him to make a move on her. She also said that black people also say slurs. I said yeah, they do, and it‚Äôs shitty, but I still felt that she was being insensitive to me, her friend that SHE KNOWS has never said any slur pertaining to another group of people. (And before any of you ask, yes, I say the n word but it‚Äôs ONLY around my family or other black friends).

I feel like I wouldn‚Äôt have cared AS MUCH if I didn‚Äôt feel as if we were close friends, on top of her always bringing up race and how ‚Äúthis group needs to stop doing this‚Äù and ‚ÄúI always see this group of people doing this.‚Äù I guess I‚Äôm just not used to my friends being so sensitive and insensitive at the same time.
And I feel that if I had a homophobic friend or if I had a crush on someone who was homophobic, she‚Äôd be so upset, and I wouldn‚Äôt even be able to handle her being mad and would stop pursuing that person immediately.

Most of our conversations are usually about race, where she starts like ‚Äúblack people do this‚Äù or ‚ÄúLatinos do this‚Äù. Sometimes I do get abgry and tell her to stfu.

M told me her dad says the n word, and seemed to look at me for a reaction. The man is 300 lbs and about 6 ft, the hell am I gonna do? She‚Äôs also told one of our mutual friends that she said the n-word because some black students paid her to say it. (Okay, weird right?).

The issue I‚Äôm having now is that M likes this Latino guy, J, that says the n-word like he gets paid $100 each time he says it. When I tried to talk to him about it during lunch, he told me ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs in my language‚Äù. I tried to explain to him that the word he said is NOT (directly) in his language. He looked at me like I was a fucking alien and walked away.

During the school year she told me that he has a girlfriend, so she wasn‚Äôt interested in him anymore. I told her about the encounters right after they happened and she didn‚Äôt seem to care, but him having a girlfriend is stopping her?

I feel today was the final straw. We were talking to this girl named Lia (17f) and somehow the conversation shifted to boys. M tells us about how she likes a guy, and when my friend K said ‚Äúthe guy that said the word?‚Äù She said yeah. M proceeds to tell us about how it doesn‚Äôt matter to her - J‚Äôs ruining his own life, to which Lia says ‚Äúthat‚Äôll ruin you as well by association‚Äù. M got mad at the poor damn girl, went on a rant about how the French should be the last people talking, and said she doesn‚Äôt care, she‚Äôs just waiting for him to make a move on her. She also said that black people also say slurs. I said yeah, they do, and it‚Äôs shitty, but I still felt that she was being insensitive to me, her friend that SHE KNOWS has never said any slur pertaining to another group of people. (And before any of you ask, yes, I say the n word but it‚Äôs ONLY around my family or other black friends).

I feel like I wouldn‚Äôt have cared AS MUCH if I didn‚Äôt feel as if we were close friends, on top of her always bringing up race and how ‚Äúthis group needs to stop doing this‚Äù and ‚ÄúI always see this group of people doing this.‚Äù I guess I‚Äôm just not used to my friends being so sensitive and insensitive at the same time.
And I feel that if I had a homophobic friend or if I had a crush on someone who was homophobic, she‚Äôd be so upset, and I wouldn‚Äôt even be able to handle her being mad and would stop pursuing that person immediately.

I feel so invalidated in my beliefs and values because faculty and staff just push matters like this to the side, not to mention how the media normalizes the use of the n-word.

Many customers had craned their necks to see where the queue ended and this one particular couple who pass me make a fuss and then disappear somewhere behind me, presumably to go to the end of the line which had only gotten longer since I'd gotten there.

Then finally, when the manager comes out and realizes they needed back up, calls over an employee to open up a register and then comes over to me in order to direct me to either of the two lines that I was now up for getting service at.

The manager knew better and recognized their a-hole behavior but also didnt want to start drama with the already backed up situation so let them stay and when she came back to me apologized.

She then directs me toward the original line and while waiting there I tell the couple who still hadnt stopped talking / making a fuss that there were ""people behind me as well"", which in my mind, was to serve as a reminder that not only did they cut me off but that it affected everyone else too.

That's when one of the two shouted at me with vitriol that it was none of my business.

Nervous adrenaline ran through me bc it felt like fighting energy was thrown my way. I try to be both polite and logical in life and wasn't even trying to get my spot back but if they were either playing dumb or actually were clueless I figured it'd serve to clarify that moment we all were in.

124,1eskmjz,AITAfor breaking my mother's perfume?,"I (18F)  have severe headaches sometimes. They are so strong that sometimes I vomit and have to go to the hospital for medication.

There are some smells that trigger these pains more, 
one of these smells is one of my mother's (41F) perfume. She has a perfume called delina. It's not the only perfume that gives me a headache, but it's the only one that gives me such a strong reaction. 

Since I realized the relationship, I asked my mother to stop using this perfume around me, and she said she would take my request into consideration. 

But I honestly think she did the opposite, although she denies it I feel like she started using it more often than before. 

When we are in open spaces this is not a problem, but in closed spaces, like in a car, my headache becomes unbearable and in 100% of the times we were in the same car with her wearing this perfume I ended up throwing up.

Last weekend was my grandmother's birthday, and she celebrated her birthday at a place 30 minutes drive from my house. I was sure my mother would use the perfume and I would have to stay near her for 30 minutes smelling that scent. So before she started getting ready I hide the perfume. She noticed that the perfume was not in its place and questioned me, but we had to leave soon and she ended up using another one. I returned it to its place the next day, and since then she has used it every day at all times.

I may be getting paranoid but I think she's sneezing all over the house. I begged her to stop, I asked my father to talk to her and nothing helped.

Today I smelled it on my pillow and I couldn't stand it, I went to her room and broke it, in front of her. We had an argument, she said I was childish, and said I would have to buy her a new one. I left her talking to herself and came to my boyfriend's house. Since then she has been calling me, my aunts and my father also called, they all say I was unreasonable.

But after some events that all changed, one of them being when an old friend of mine (Let‚Äôs call her Rye) introduced their friend to my old friend group. (Call her Kayla) 

But first, here‚Äôs some info about Rye, she was the type of person to constantly get into trouble with people. Even a friend, but then later on she‚Äôd befriend them. It was an ongoing loop, she was usually a nice person, actively talking to me and hanging out with me like a friend would. I saw her as family. But she began to change when meeting Kayla.

Back to Kayla, she always seemed to have an attitude, but not with just me, but with my everyone else as well (Even to Rye). This caused a lot of drama that went on for about 4 months, Rye always defended her, even when Kayla offended her. It eventually got to the point where Rye started to distance away from the group to join Kayla‚Äôs. We did try to treat Kayla with kindness, but that did not work out. So we just gave up, two friends and I decided to cut them all off and move on. That put me through depressive state that lasted awhile, considering that I knew them for about 4 years. 

Now let‚Äôs move to my current friend group, they do have a lot of drama as well, and I somehow get roped into it. They have introduced me to many people before, but they either left our group or turned out to have done some pretty messed up crap. Causing us to cut them off.

Or at least that was until they did it again, this time they asked me via text in a gc that we had, but I was not available at the time. So, another friend in the group just told them to go on with it. 

When I saw the person there, I simply left. They blew up my phone asking why I never showed up, and I told them that I wasn‚Äôt going to be around someone that I did not know.

So, I'm part of a playdate group that my sister invited me to. We're all in the 30s-40s range and our daughters are in the 6-8 age range, but we're all at different life stages.

In this situation I did just that, but it became concerning when she would FaceTime him at 6am, and Snapchat and text 24/7. (More than us). He had got caught snapping and texting her when i had asked him not to and hid messages from her when I asked him to stop talking to her because I wasn‚Äôt comfortable. I‚Äôve asked him repeatedly if they were ever a thing or if they ever slept with each other and he always denied. I had a bad feeling from day one  because of him hiding messages from her and deleting them. Today I went on his computer without the intention of snooping but none the less I found something and found pictures of them (naked). They are old pictures but the reason I‚Äôm here is because he lied to me about ever having anything with her romantically. Swore up and down they were just friends. I confronted him today about what I saw and told him he needed to stay else where until I could decide what I wanted to do. He‚Äôs mad because I was snooping and found them.  Told me that we wouldn‚Äôt be here if I wasn‚Äôt digging for garbage on him from the past. AITAH for telling him to sleep somewhere else and that I can‚Äôt trust him? He seems to think so. ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-15,"AITAH for old photos on boyfriend computer So I‚Äôm not really sure how to word this so bear with me.

130,1esjga4,AITA for Ruining a Dinner with my BF?,"context: me(29f) and my bf(30m) have been together 2 years.

today we planned to have a late lunch/early dinner because i had to take care of family matters in the beginning and end of the day, which i told me bf about. he was upset to begin with because we could not go to dinner, but finally agreed to a 2:30 lunch. he wanted to go to a specific restaurant so we had a plan.

i had an appt with some family around 1:30. i get a text from him saying the restaurant he chose would be too expensive for him, so he wanted to go somewhere else. i suggested three other places, but got no response back. i was done with the appt an hour early than i expected so i let him know that i could come get him now, or i could run some errands for an hour to align better with our scheduled time. i get no response, so i run my errands. about a half hour later i get a text saying ""hurry up"", and ""im waiting on you"". i simply reply with an ok, and i go pick him up.

he gets in my car, silently staring at me. at this point im a little upset, and explain why; for his lack of communication and for being upset at me when i told him what was going on on my end.

we figure out a place to eat, and the whole time he constantly is telling me not to be so grumpy and sensitive. i reiterate why i was so, and i simply got an ""ok"".

we get back in the car after food, im feeling a bit better. im stopped at a stoplight and he randomly puts my cars emergency brake on. i wouldnt have known if i hadnt seen the blinking breaklight on my dash. 

i told him to not touch my car when im driving, and he began saying im overreacting, it was a joke, and that i should just take him home if im going to act like this, implying that i ruined our time together.

132,1esiwmm,"AITA if I don't let my dad walk me on senior night, even though it's his fault?","I (18F) am a senior in high school this year, and I'm grappling with a tough decision about who should walk me on my senior nights. My father remarried when I was three to someone I'll call Mary, who brought her son, Tyler, into our lives. Tyler was three years older than me, and they later had a son named Bryan, though he isn't relevant to this story. My parents had a 50-50 custody arrangement, so I would stay with my mom Monday and Tuesday, my dad Wednesday and Thursday, and alternate weekends.

When I was four and Tyler was seven, he began mistreating me. My father dismissed my claims, accusing me of lying to get Tyler in trouble. This continued for a year until I confided in my mom, who then sought full custody. My father and Mary sided against me, claiming I was lying and that my mom was planting ideas in my head. It was decided informally that I would stay with my dad‚Äôs parents during his custodial time. This arrangement eventually led to me living permanently with my grandparents when I was ten.

During this period, my father struggled with an opioid addiction, often leaving me with Mary and Tyler, who treated me poorly. My grandfather became my father figure, attending all my events and supporting me in every way. When I was twelve, my dad divorced Mary after getting clean. He moved out, and his custody agreement with Mary and Bryan became similar to my mom's arrangement with me.

My father has never taken responsibility for his actions or the trauma he caused. He remains the only person who can manipulate and gaslight me effectively, which he knows and uses to his advantage. As I've grown and recognized the impact of his behavior, our relationship has deteriorated. My relationship with my grandmother is also strained because she refuses to acknowledge my father's wrongdoing and continues to support his habits.

Now, as I approach senior nights for my high school dance and figure skating teams, I'm conflicted about who should walk me. I plan to have my grandfather accompany me for the figure skating senior night. However, I'm unsure if I should let my father walk me on the other senior nights. All my friends believe my grandfather is my dad, and while I feel my grandfather deserves to be honored, I also worry that not having my father walk me might lead to emotional manipulation and guilt.

I (22M) have been dating my gf Sunny (19F) for a while. She has a very carefree but cautious attitude while I'm more straight-laced and honest. All good, just a difference in personality.

So a typical scam message came by her phone, and she sent me a screenshot of her replying to it. I was so confused as to why she replied if she was very cautious. I replied along the lines of ""wtf, why did you respond?"" Sunny was like ""it's okay bae, I blocked them, I just wanted to troll them before blocking them,"" which she should've done instantly.

She then did the same sequence AGAIN (to another scammer,) and I was genuinely upset. As someone who has been on the receiving end of scams, I know how scary it can be because it can deffo snowball out of control. I then replied ""wtf, why did you do it again? I thought you knew better, just delete it and move on. I'm surprised you even entertained the idea of trolling them in the first place.""

She found this offensive and started calling me rude and disrespectful, and said ""I had no manners."" I was actually dumbfounded, and replied in the lines of ""manners? this has nothing to do with manners. this is basic net safety. if you don't recognize a number, you delete it and move on. udk who they are or if they seized any info from you."" Sunny was still upset that I was \[probably\] being rude to her, but I diffused the situation by telling her to stay safe and careful because these scammers can be slick and do something unwarranted just from a single reply.

I was probably a bit harsh and should've chosen different wording -- because my right words are someone else's wrong words -- but I was concerned for her safety. I didn't want Sunny to face the same things I went through when I got scammed.

Let‚Äôs start at the beginning. My (30F) parents (52 M, 51 F) got divorced when I was 5 after my dad cheated on my mom with a woman twice his age. I took it quite hard, especially when my dad started making me go stay the night with him at his mistress‚Äô house and got mad at me when I didn‚Äôt want to. 

While he paid my mom child support and helped me when I needed to move or had car issues he also:
Only paid me attention when he was single.
Married 3x, divorced 2 - once to a woman only 7 years my elder who hated me.
Talked shit about my mom and maternal grandmother for no reason- accused them of making him look bad (they didn‚Äôt)
Left me by myself to go to the bar when I drove an hour and a half to see him on weekends in high school
Got mad at my grandparents for wanting to give him money to help me buy a car because that was HIS job
Stopped giving me allowance bc his wife at the time didn‚Äôt want him to
Got super religious, told me women weren‚Äôt supposed to lead but follow in relationship 
Promised to be more present in my life, didn‚Äôt.

I am getting married in a little over a month. I am not religious like my dad and I am not traditional at all. I don‚Äôt like the message of the father ‚Äúgiving‚Äù the daughter to her husband so I asked a non parental figure - my brother‚Äî to escort me in at my wedding. I knew this would bother my dad as his view of marriage is that it‚Äôs holy and that it‚Äôs his right and honor as a dad to ‚Äúgive me away.‚Äù So I made sure to include a father-daughter dance, even though I didn‚Äôt want one, as a compromise. 

I messaged my dad to ask for some contact info for other relatives about the wedding. He decided that was the appropriate time to tell me that he picked up and moved to another state 10 hours away without telling me and asked when he needed to be in for the wedding. I used this time to tell him that he‚Äôs not in the ceremony but that he‚Äôs invited to the rehearsal and has a father daughter dance at the reception. 

He did not respond to me for 3 weeks and I got a message this past weekend that said ‚ÄúI will not be attending your wedding. I was concerned ever since you got engaged that I would be left out of the ceremony, and I can‚Äôt pretend to be happy to be on the sidelines. I love you and I grieve our relationship.

137,1eshtvh,AITA Pregnant wife seems unreasonable,"37M married 4 years to my wife 32F. We have a 3 year old girl and my wife is expecting twins in less than a month. To say these last few months have been challenging is an understatement. About 1 month into the pregnancy my wife began to tell me how she hates the way I smell. I was told to move all of my showing supplies soap etc to guest bathroom and then after each shower, clear the show with bleach because that to her was the only thing that smells clean. I did not resist and I went along with it since during her first pregnancy she was hypersensitive to smell. 

As the pregnancy progressed over the past few months, things have since got worse. She has become more verbally confrontational, calling me a worthless man, a bad husband, and a bad father. I have not always stood up for my wife like I have should and I have communicated this to her. She is a strong personality and I like that about her.

For the most part usually take these and brush them off, but lately they have been happening so much that I have decided to ""stand up"" more for myself and tell her that she is wrong, but then it only makes it worse and then it cycles into a argument to nowhere. She now tells me that I am a bully and hate all women and do not respect pregnancy that no normal man would behave this way (standing up and saying no). She then tries to guilt and say ""Friend Y's husband. would never do this."" You should be ashamed. Things have now got worse that she says she could be dying and I would not care. She has already told me I cannot be at the hospital for the birth of the children and she has also named the children and will not tell me the names. She says she has a support system. I am trying hard not to be a victim to this and wondering what I am doing and how much of this is me being an asshole. She has now resorted to calling me a total beta male and even started to call me a F\*g .

I have allowed other family members to bully my wife in the past and wrongly did not stand up for her and regret and and apologized. I have since cut those family members our of our lives, but that still happened. I have also not been the most financially responsbile person and that has been a point of frustration with her in the past as well. Again, I have made the steps to change that part of myself, but it still has happened. About seven years ago she physically attacked me due to her being upset with how I handled a financial situation. It did not hurt and I just let her do it, but at times I remind her that she did that and I have forgave her, but I am seeing that if these are any other red flags that I should not ignore.

I know I have engaged in these verbal fights and lost may temper when I should have been more cool, but never and physical or verbal abuse. I am simply looking to know if I am missing something here or AITA? I do not want to be a catalyst for this behavior  and am hyper aware of my behavior around her. I love my wife and have a lot of respect for here. I don't hate her or women and am looking for a sense of sanity here.

*Update: I made some updates in the comments below, but I asked if if I could talk to her Dr or go to an appointment and that was met with a hard NO. When pressed she said that if I even spoke to her Dr. , she would tell him that she is uncomfortable around me and to not let me around. I dropped it at that point because any Dr. that would even hear that has an obligation to believe that what she is saying is true.*

*For the past month, I have been living separately. Since she is inc charge of the finances in the company and the only source of income I have at the movement, I am not on an allowance that she controls, which includes the rest for the temp housing. I am trying to stay positive in this. I am not allowed to see our other child now and I am told the only way to now see them is if there is a legal parenting agreement in place and it would not be good for her because she would not understand. I am currently on a ""vacation"".*

Everything during this past few months seem magnified by 10x*",Not the A-hole,2024-08-15,"AITA Pregnant wife seems unreasonable 37M married 4 years to my wife 32F. We have a 3 year old girl and my wife is expecting twins in less than a month. To say these last few months have been challenging is an understatement. About 1 month into the pregnancy my wife began to tell me how she hates the way I smell. I was told to move all of my showing supplies soap etc to guest bathroom and then after each shower, clear the show with bleach because that to her was the only thing that smells clean. I did not resist and I went along with it since during her first pregnancy she was hypersensitive to smell. 

As the pregnancy progressed over the past few months, things have since got worse. She has become more verbally confrontational, calling me a worthless man, a bad husband, and a bad father. I have not always stood up for my wife like I have should and I have communicated this to her. She is a strong personality and I like that about her.

For the most part usually take these and brush them off, but lately they have been happening so much that I have decided to ""stand up"" more for myself and tell her that she is wrong, but then it only makes it worse and then it cycles into a argument to nowhere. She now tells me that I am a bully and hate all women and do not respect pregnancy that no normal man would behave this way (standing up and saying no). She then tries to guilt and say ""Friend Y's husband. would never do this."" You should be ashamed. Things have now got worse that she says she could be dying and I would not care. She has already told me I cannot be at the hospital for the birth of the children and she has also named the children and will not tell me the names. She says she has a support system. I am trying hard not to be a victim to this and wondering what I am doing and how much of this is me being an asshole. She has now resorted to calling me a total beta male and even started to call me a F\*g .

I have allowed other family members to bully my wife in the past and wrongly did not stand up for her and regret and and apologized. I have since cut those family members our of our lives, but that still happened. I have also not been the most financially responsbile person and that has been a point of frustration with her in the past as well. Again, I have made the steps to change that part of myself, but it still has happened. About seven years ago she physically attacked me due to her being upset with how I handled a financial situation. It did not hurt and I just let her do it, but at times I remind her that she did that and I have forgave her, but I am seeing that if these are any other red flags that I should not ignore.

I know I have engaged in these verbal fights and lost may temper when I should have been more cool, but never and physical or verbal abuse. I am simply looking to know if I am missing something here or AITA? I do not want to be a catalyst for this behavior  and am hyper aware of my behavior around her. I love my wife and have a lot of respect for here. I don't hate her or women and am looking for a sense of sanity here.

*Update: I made some updates in the comments below, but I asked if if I could talk to her Dr or go to an appointment and that was met with a hard NO. When pressed she said that if I even spoke to her Dr. , she would tell him that she is uncomfortable around me and to not let me around. I dropped it at that point because any Dr. that would even hear that has an obligation to believe that what she is saying is true.*

*For the past month, I have been living separately. Since she is inc charge of the finances in the company and the only source of income I have at the movement, I am not on an allowance that she controls, which includes the rest for the temp housing. I am trying to stay positive in this. I am not allowed to see our other child now and I am told the only way to now see them is if there is a legal parenting agreement in place and it would not be good for her because she would not understand. I am currently on a ""vacation"".*

*I still have the bills in my name at the house and paid recently paid a past due electricity bill and was then lectured and corrected that I am spending her money and her companies money even when it is money I earned from a consulting gig that I have.

I had told her I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll be able to go because of baseball but I told her I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be able to (shouldve known better). The other day was the last day to get a refund on tickets and she asked me if I‚Äôm positive I can go. I replied with im not positive yet because our coach hasn‚Äôt told us anything about next week (next Friday is the concert). But to my poor insight, our coach told us later that day that we would intersquad (scrimmage against each other) that Saturday. So I would have to go to the concert at 7, assuming the concert would end at 7, and after getting out of the parking lot and taking her home and filling up yada, I would imagine it‚Äôd be about 11-12 before I got on the highway, meaning I wouldn‚Äôt get back to my dorms until 1-2 am and have to be up at 7 to compete for my spot on the team.

140,1esgzuo,AITA for asking my stepmom to get my attention? ,"i'm 19M with unmedicated combined ADHD(as well as other stuff lol.) I tend to zone out or focus really hard on stuff.

I was playing a game on my phone yesterday and I guess my stop mom was telling me and my step sister about the whole house of 7 people needing to use less TP. I didn't realize she was talking to us until she walked away so I asked my step sister what she was talking about. she said ""I don't know, go ask her yourself"" so clearly she wasn't paying much attention either.

skip to later around 9-10 pm, she is telling my brother the TP thing and calls me out, so I was confused and asked her what she meant. she explained again and asked why I wasn't listening earlier, I asked her if I was doing something distracting and if she had gotten my attention prior to telling me something. she said that she didn't and she shouldn't have to. I simply stated that I don't always just pay attention when people talk to me, and half the time I do I get told it's none of my business anyways, so the least she can do is tap me or say my name, but she went off about how I don't respect or listen to her. 

I was kind of baffled at this point, laughing nervously and smiling, which kind of set her off more. she started going off on how if I can't listen to her I can go buy my own TP... and then started ranting off about how I can also buy my own headache medicine (I do, but I used some of the family bottle when I got my wisdoms out) and my own cold medicine and food(again, buy this too) etc etc and then said I needed to stop using them. by using them, they meant using TP and... asking for rides to dental procedures/surgeries because i'm being put under. this did set me off and I said some things i probably shouldn't have but this is also isn't the first time that they say I'm using them or being selfish etc etc. they've been saying stuff like this since I was like, 15. I buy a lot of my own stuff bc ever since my first job at 14, ""I should be able to get my own stuff and not rely on them"", I went off on how I'm tired of them constantly saying stuff like that and being disrespectful to me. that just got her more mad and my dad yelled at me to go to my room, so I did.
I threw the broom down the stairs out of frustration, caused 0 damage to anything and it only went down a few steps, so my step mom said she's going to kick me out in a month and also go down to my room and break all my stuff. 
obviously throwing the broom wasn't a good idea but that response felt excessive.

so, am I the asshole for simply asking her to get my attention if she's trying to talk to me and starting a huge argument?
