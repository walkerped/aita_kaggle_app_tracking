0,1eskcrg,AITA for Refusing to Rewrite an Apology Letter?,"I (17 nonbinary) had to write my grandfather (70 M) an apology letter. There was a situation a while back where he was a 'sponsor' of sorts for a teen-operated community service organization. The problem is that he's a very old-fashioned guy, and most if not ALL of the members were queer, including me. A large proportion of the members really didn't like him on the basis of misgendering, or him referring to a couple of two girls as 'friends'. Many of them began talking about him behind his back to me. I never encouraged it, but I did vent my own frustrations with him, and didn't tell them to stop. My mother made me write him an apology letter months after the fact, and is displeased with it. I bent over backwards to say I should have stepped in, told them to stop, or talked to him about it (even though that was not an option, since he's an authority figure to us, and confronting someone like him about long-standing bigotry isn't an option, that isn't going to go well.) but that apparently wasn't enough.

Am I the asshole for refusing to rewrite the letter?

  
EDIT: A few key details about the situation I forgot to include: We attempted to explain multiple times how we wanted to be referred to. There were two non-binary people (one okay with he/they, another only with they/them) and a trans guy (he/him), and it was brought up frequently that the two girls were in a relationship. There were a lot of quiet corrections, but he refused to change how he referred to us.  Also, his role as a 'sponsor' wasn't a money thing, it was getting us the ability to work with the adult-run community service group, so we were able to help more.",POO Mode Activated ðŸ’©,2024-08-15,"AITA for Refusing to Rewrite an Apology Letter?
