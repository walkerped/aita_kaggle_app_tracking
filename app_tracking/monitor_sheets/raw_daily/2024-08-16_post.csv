0,1etnmg6,AITA for trying to get my younger brother on HRT without his parents' consent?,"My (M23) younger brother, Liam (FTM16) is transgender, he's always been certain that he's a lad, not a girl. When our kid was younger, 12 like, I'd find him getting ready to go out in my clothes and he'd reject anything for lasses, he'd never let anyone call him a girl, his birth name or she/her.

Liam ended up with a foster family when he was 13. Only thing I can say for them is that they're middle class so they're getting our kid the stuff he wouldn't have with me on the road constantly and earning nowt much. They don't get him at all, they think it's some sort of phase, they have an idea of the family they want and they're trying their best to get it; that includes Liam being a lass and limiting his contact with people he knew before they had him. They don't call my lad male pronouns, they 'compromise' with using they/them, they buy him clothes from both sections.

Last time he came over to my place after school, our kid was moaning about it all. He's a pretty lad, passes, taller than me lmao, but he's upset because he's not in a body he feels comfortable with and his foster parents, Jane (F45) and Graham (M48) are reluctant if not at all against the idea of him being on blockers or hrt.

I love the lad more than owt, I'm gonna do anything for him, so i'm trying to get Liam on HRT. It's a pain in the arse and spenny as hell, Liam's trying to convince me to DIY it with him. My partner, Johnny (M28) brought up recently that its an asshole move to pull the rug out from under his parents feet like that, and that there's only 2 years left until our kid is on his own so perhaps its not worth it if its going to totally wreck his relationship with Jane and Graham.",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-08-16,"AITA for trying to get my younger brother on HRT without his parents' consent?

1,1etgtem,UPDATE: AITA for making my partners drinking water too warm?,"UPDATE: AITA for making my partners drinking water too warm?

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vjclfg/aita_for_making_my_partners_drinking_water_too/)

So 2 years on, I thought I'd make an update to the original debacle that confused everyone and polarised the community. There was so many comments, some incredibly empathetic and helpful, some racist and mean but generally I don't believe there was ever a consensus reached. Despite all that, I was incredibly grateful to all the comments received from everyone. Whilst I didn't take the time to reply, I actually did read through them all.

On to the update...

So as some people pointed out, our argument was not really about the water. Generally in every relationship, every person just wants to feel seen, heard, important, understood, and loved. My actions that day did not make her feel that way, and in of itself was more indicative of a longer running issue between us in our relationship.

For a bit of background, we both have (had) childhood trauma and the beginning of our relationship was quite volatile. Defying the odds we stayed together and got married, however marriage doesn't solve those issues.

Over the last 2 years, we've continued to stay together - Yes - We are still married (much to the chagrin of those who were advocating our divorce \*side eye\*) and continued to grow together.

Believe it or not the incident involving the water was a bit of a catalyst to us having better conversations regarding how we are going to resolve our own trauma and improve our communication.

Long story short, she got therapy, I got therapy, we did some marriage counselling, she got more therapy, I got more therapy and it's been a journey, but a worthwhile one.

When two people really do love each other, and want to work it out, they'll find a way to. I'm so genuinely grateful for my wife, who she was, who she is now, the strength she has and the belief she had in us, and more so in me.

Our communication is better than it's ever been, our intimacy is stronger than it's ever been and we are at such an amazing place. The future looks incredibly bright.

It took a lot of work to get here, and there's a lot more work left to be done, but we have each other's backs and we'll keep going together.

Thank you again Reddit and whilst this update might not be what some of you were hoping for, it's where we are at now!

TL;DR - Worked on ourselves, got therapy and counselling, worked through underlying issues individually, and as a couple, improved our communication by leaps and bounds, we are now closer, stronger and better than ever before!",UPDATE,2024-08-16,"UPDATE: AITA for making my partners drinking water too warm?

2,1eu3os9,AITA for telling my girlfriend it's crazy she wants to plead guilty for a red light violation ticket instead of paying for a fine?,"My girlfriend and I live in Alberta and I let her drive my car (registered and paid by myself) since she doesn't have one.

We received a mail today that on August 3rd around 4:30 pm my car ran a red light, which is obviously a violation and must either pay a fine of $405 or go to the court and contest the fine.

I knew she's responsible for the ticket because she drove to hang out with some friends on 3rd ( a Saturday) so there's no argument who was responsible for the fine. What I don't understand is why she insist on going to the court and contest so she could reduce the fine.

I found it pretty ridiculous because she literally got caught on camera of running a red light!!!

She told me she'll handle it since it's her fault but since the car is registered under my name I am still liable at the end of the day.

AITA for suggesting her just take the loss instead of going to court?

(she can definitely afford the fine and since its due november it's not like she doesnt have time to prepare the money).

  
edit: In Alberta, as the owner of the vehicle, I will have to go to the court with her should she want to contest. Which I don't want to do. 

As for reduction of the ticket. A speeding ticket might be reduced but a red light ticket almost never. I know she's frustrated but makes no sense she insist on going to the court (which I will have to go as well)

3,1eu3o2v,AITA - Partner seemingly expecting a lot out of me,"Hi there all - thanks in advance for your input on this.

My partner and I are both hardworking individuals who have kept very busy schedules with multiple jobs/streams of income, our families, and our hobbies. Recently, I started my journey to my MD and have barely any time for anything other than studying. Prior to pursuing my MD, I was working within the business world and gained a nice network of individuals doing so. My partner has been struggling with a few things with their entrepreneurial work and has faced a decent amount of financial hardship over the past six months. Prior to my return to academia, I was happy to provide financially for them when they  
asked for help, as my income was steady and relatively high. However, since starting my program, I’ve needed to put a halt on this – becoming a doctor is not cheap, as we all know. Truly, I’d love to be able to continue working and having an income while pursuing my MD and continue to help financially, but this is not sustainable. My partner seemed agitated with me when I first told them I would no longer be able to help financially, and we have had to have a few talks rehashing the fact that I am now a full-time student and will also be incurring debt over the next few years. I have always tried to give the benefit of the doubt due to my love for them. However, coupled with this, I was also asked to craft them a new resume, which I did at the beginning of the year, and use my business network to find them a new position. My partner stated both were due to my skill at putting together resumes and my network. Again, I found myself doing this due to my love for them. However, recently, I have felt more and more resentful of all the above – especially because I was not successful in finding them a job within my network and was asked to start directly applying to online job posts. This was been deemed a “joint effort” that was for “our future” though from the beginning, that “we” seems to have instead been solely me, and not anything having to do with them putting in the effort alongside of me. As my studying has picked up, they have continued to ask me to find work for them, and weekly will ask me “how the job search is going”. When I say that I really have not had the time or space to look for jobs for them due to my schooling, they act like I am in the wrong, and say things like “it feels like this is not a priority to you and you have not been putting in the time on this like I feel you should”. AITA for feeling like none of this should be my responsibility in the first place, especially since we are not married? And AITA for believing that, even if we were married right now, this is just not right? I have quite a lot of stress on my shoulders right now with learning to take care of others' lives, and the emotional strain this has had is substantial.

4,1eu3ff4,AITA for telling my sibling I will fine them for not cleaning up after themself?,"I (F18) am living with my family through college as my college is close by and due to scholarships, I am able to go to school for almost free. In my family, we have always had chores. My sibling (16) and I both have dishes 3 nights a week, they sweep the kitchen and I have to keep our bathroom clean, cleaning sinks, shower, toilet, mirror, floors and organizing. 

I am a generally tidy person and I always clean up after myself when using the bathroom. My sibling on the other hand is not. They leave clothes (sometimes with period blood) and towels in the bathroom floor, leave pad wrappers on the ground next to the toilet when there is a trash can NEXT TO THE TOILET, they have smeared blood on the floor and generally, they leave the bathroom in disarray. I would be let it go if it was once a month but they trash the bathroom every-time they use it. 

I just deep cleaned and reorganized our bathroom which took 2 days to do and I only finished today. After a few hours of finishing, I walk upstairs to see it covered in clothes, our sink covered in their hair products and MY TOWELS on the floor. This led to me going into my siblings room and i discovered they had been using my towel to dry off instead of grabbing their own. EW! 
This same sibling has also only showered twice in the last week even though we all did things such as fishing and hiking. EVEN MORE EW!!!!! 

Where I might be the asshole is telling my family I am instating a bathroom code of conduct, where breaking the rules lead to fines (of like $10). These rules are simple : flush, clean up your clothes and towels, return the bathroom to how you found it. My mom said i was nagging my sibling too much about keeping clean and it is my job to clean the bathroom, which ticked me off cus my sibling only has to sweep a room, taking max 10 minutes.

In that time he gave me several items of clothing as boyfriends tend to do. My best friend (18f) let’s call her Jess came over to my house and asked to borrow a pair of joggers. (I’m British) I didn’t have any since mine were in the wash so I let her borrow a pair of me now ex boyfriend’s. 

We recently got into an argument because she cancelled on me last second after my mam had rearranged my birthday in order for her to be able to come since she promised she would keep that Saturday off work. We talked about it to which I asked about the joggers. Baring in mind it has been a year since I had let her borrow them. I have asked multiple times for them back to which she replied ‘they are at *other friends name*’. I was told that Jess and this friend weren’t on speaking terms so asked for her information so that she didn’t have to text someone she was on bad terms with (I later find out that this isn’t true since that friend messages me). She told me she had lost them and that they weren’t at her friend’s house. So I asked for the money to replace the joggers.

He invited me to attend a hangout with his friends a couple of weeks ago and introduced me as his friend. I was really hurt and asked him why he did that. He said it’s because he has a pregnant baby mama and he doesn’t want his friends to think that he’s being messy. (Most people don’t know he has a baby on the way because he broke up with her)

A little background, I did not know he had a baby on the way when I started dating him. Before things got serious, I asked him if he was seeing anyone or if he had any kids and he told me no. After dating for about 3 months I got pregnant and miscarried at 8 weeks. I found out that he had a baby on the way when I was 7 weeks when I found a strange note in his phone but he denied it and ended up admitting it after the miscarriage. The incident with his friends happened after the miscarriage. 

A few days ago, he invited me to hangout with his friends and I asked him how he was going to introduce me. He said he would introduce me as a friend. I got mad and stormed off.

He said it’s because he has a pregnant baby mama and he doesn’t want his friends to think that he’s being messy. (Most people don’t know he has a baby on the way because he broke up with her)

A little background, I did not know he had a baby on the way when I started dating him. Before things got serious, I asked him if he was seeing anyone or if he had any kids and he told me no. After dating for about 3 months I got pregnant and miscarried at 8 weeks. I found out that he had a baby on the way when I was 7 weeks when I found a strange note in his phone but he denied it and ended up admitting it after the miscarriage. The incident with his friends happened after the miscarriage. 

A few days ago, he invited me to hangout with his friends and I asked him how he was going to introduce me. He said he would introduce me as a friend. I got mad and stormed off. Now typing this out I realize I might not be the asshole but I’d like to hear different perspectives. AITA for storming off?",0.0,0.0836917906999588,0,1

Well I read the book and though I didn't think it was bad by any means, a lot of it just wasn't for me, and I thought it was pretty flawed In a lotta ways. I thought the romance in the book was terribly written, there were missed opportunities for things that could've been really fun, and I hated the ending!

I told all this to her and she was shocked! She accused me of not actually reading the book, to wich I mentioned several scenes from the book ones I enjoyed snd ines I didn't to show her I did in fact read it. 

She was very upset and asked how I could possibly not love the book and even asked if maybe I was mad at her and telling her I hated the book to be mean. I of course told her that I wasn't mad at her I just didn't like the book that much.

She was still very upset and left saying she needed to be alone for s but. 

This was a couple nights ago, I've tried calling her but she won't answe or return my calls and now I'm thinking maybe I did something wrong if it really upset her that much.

She started dating her ex about 6 years ago and they got engaged 3 years ago. Then the engagement ended a year afterwards and they broke up but had to keep living together. 

I found out later she had cheated with him with a married coworker multiple times for a few months before he found out. The affair caused the coworker to be divorced. Due to housing issues in GTA they kept living together and got back together a year after that breakup. The problem was she agreed to leave her workplace because the coworker still worked there. Well he said she agreed and she said she would try. She never did and he began getting paranoid she would cheat on him again with the coworker because they were still working in the same place everyday and seeing each other.

Finally the coworker’s ex wife sent a photo of the coworker and my friend together after work having drinks and my friend’s fiancé lost it (they got reengaged).

12,1eu23d2,AITA For not giving my grandma money,"
 I’m 20f my grandmother is 46f. This started back in 2021 when my mother passed. We moved in with our grandmother that week of her passing we knew that it was going to be a big change for us we were used to living with her but now it was just different she used to be fun to hang around but now she’s cold 

now she gets angry when we don’t do something she likes or just stops talking to us all together. In 2022 I started working for my grandmother helping her out with her medicine, cooking, cleaning, and taking her to doctor appointments. In late 2023 or early 2024, I moved out with my boyfriend not too far from her but far enough I told her I was doing this beforehand and she was ok with it then when I started packing my stuff she started asking why I had to move and that I can stay with her and not spend the extra money I told her I wanted to start my life on my own and not be criticized for it but she wasn’t happy about that I moved anyway 


always coming back to help her when she needed it she still asked if I would ever move back in and my answer would always be the same I want to live on my own and nothing can change that she would drop it after that but I could tell that she was angry about it. Now I met my boyfriend when my mother was still alive so in 2020 when my grandmother first met my boyfriend she didn’t say anything to him or even notice him when he came over. Like I said before I moved out and lived with my boyfriend he would come over from time to time when I was helping her out she would be cold towards him for no reason at all he stopped coming over when my sister overheard her talk to someone about us her reasoning’s where that he took me away from her if I knew what that means so he stopped coming over and taking to her 


I would still come and help her but I also started to overhear her talking about me to friends and family about that I moved away or lie that I don’t come over anymore or talk to her anymore then want to be all buddy when she sees me and act like what she said never happened I confronted her about it and she told me that she wasn’t talking about me and that I’m just listening in on the wrong time I told her that I have heard the whole thing and what she said and be missed heard but yet again she gets angry and annoyed that I wasn’t listening. Now last week before she asked for money I tell that I was trying to get a house and move out of the area I was in she said ok but continued to ask for money or half of my check I don’t make much just enough to live comfortably I don’t live paycheck to paycheck but it might happen if she keeps asking for money.

She has been by my side through some of the darkest times, including when I was 14 and lost my dad, even came to his funeral to support me. Came abroad to my graduation in November 2023. I've come back to my country for holidays for 3 weeks. She's having a rough time at home and lives far away from the city in a village. Stayed at mine for about 3-4 days.

I haven't seen my grandma who is in a care home in about 8 years, since my dad died due to various reasons. My half sister offered to go see grandma but couldn't pick me up from my city as she lives further away. Getting the bus would require going at 15:30 and getting the 21:30 bus back since it's the only bus that passes by. Problem was, sister said she would need to go sooner so I'd wait at the bus stop on way back for hours. Asked my best friend if she could take me to the care home to see my grandma and I would pay her petrol and she said she ""has plans"" I asked if it was having coffee with her other friends and she said yeah. I sarcastically said ""sounds important"" and expressed I was a bit upset that despite me helping her out by letting her stay at mine for days so she doesn't have to 1) sleep on a sofa at home & 2) spend loads on petrol going from her village to the city whenever she wanted to see her friends while she was at mine and after that we became distant and she left. Am I the asshole here? I've tried texting her to talk but she seems to be ""busy"".

I'm especially pissed off because these friends she sees almost daily and on Monday they're going to a villa together. I think she's trying to bootlick one of them considering they own a house now and she wants to move in with them as she has issues at home.

14,1eu1nqk,AITA for asking my mum to not eat food I leave overnight?,"I (17F) and my mum (45F) both live together, just as the two of us. I have an older brother but he moved out a few years ago. Everything is good between me and my mum, we often laugh and joke together and have a strong family bond. However, one habit of my mum's really annoys me, and I'm not sure if this is a normal thing or if I should actually have a problem with it. Whenever I have a nicer kind of food, such as a sweet dessert or some sweet snacks like biscuits or cakes, my mum cannot help but eat said item of food if it is left unattended. While she often apologises for this, and I understand that it is a deep-running habit picked up from her childhood of being told she constantly had to clear her plate at mealtimes, recently the habit has particularly worsened, to the extent that I find myself hiding packs of biscuits and other snacks in the house so that I can still enjoy them. Which brings us to the conversation that we have just had.

Earlier today, my mum and I went to our local shop, which sells a range of cakes, sweets and biscuits, and she picked out a small cake each for both of us. I am quite unwell for unrelated reasons at the moment, so my appetite isn't great, so I only ate a bit of the cake and decided to save the rest for later. This evening, we went out for a meal, which completely filled my stomach due to my lack of appetite, so I was in no way prepared to finish the cake from earlier. So when my mum asked what I wanted to do with the cake, I asked if she could put it in the fridge so that I could have it in the morning, to which she replied ""ha, no chance."" This really frustrated me, as I still wanted to eat the cake, and appreciated the fact that she had bought it for me, I just wasn't ready to eat it today, so I replied, sternly saying ""no, I want you to put the cake in the fridge and not eat it, because it's mine and I would still like to eat it tomorrow,"" leading to my mum deciding to act cold and callous with me, hardly speaking to me unless it was necessary.

Okay, maybe I shouldn't have spoken to my own mother sternly, but I couldn't keep putting up with the complete lack of respect for my personal belongings. I am also aware that my mum paid for the cake, so probably had rights to take it back if she wanted, but the principle of taking somebody else's food when they aren't strictly done with it is what bothers me.

17,1eu19wi,AITAH for this response?,"Yesterday my bf (M21) asked if I(F21) was upset, and I responded with this:

“no i want alone time but idk how to communicate that bc i feel like i have to text you all the time or else it means somethings wrong or there's a problem. sometimes i just don't want to talk to anyone even you and it doesn't mean im upset i just want to be left alone”

Prior to that I had been texting him dryly. I’m an introvert and I like to be alone and not be bothered by anyone every so often, even him, but I don’t always know how to communicate that. Especially since in the past, he would get very upset at times about me not replying soon enough, and made false assumptions about me cheating on him many times, so I’m afraid to do anything. 

He hasn’t replied back and has left me on read for almost a day now, and I get that I said I wanted alone time, but it sort of bothers me that he had nothing to say back. Ik I need to work on my communication, I recently started therapy to help with that and other things, but I feel like I have some sort of trauma due to the way he has treated and reacted to me in the past and it’s hard to stand up for myself sometimes.

18,1eu0zh8,AITA for telling my friend off for being obnoxious at the punk fest?,"I (17M) and my best friend (17F) Recently went to a punk festival with a friend of hers (19M), who is really into the scene. While it is a movement that interests me and align with, i am not involved enough to the point  i could personally and comfortably label myself a punk. Because of this, as an outsider, i tried to keep a low profile. However, my best friend was acting pretty insufferable, interrupting conversations, playing loud music in inappropriate places, and otherwise bring unnecessary attention to herself, which to be completely honest, is stuff she does on the daily back home

During the festival, she would specifically interrupt conversations with irrelevant topics, blasted music at a public pool (and was extremely offended when asked to turn it down or at least play some ska), talked at an obnoxious volume… stuff that obviously bothered the other event goers, so i told her off. She again, was extremely offended by this. At one point i fully snapped, but when i tried to apologize for that incident, she wanted me to apologize for the music conflict too, paraphrasing what i said into making it seem like i had called her rude, when i had not done such thing. I refused, since i still feel i was justified in telling her off on that. 

The situation escalated when she decided to leave with a stranger she met at the festival, leaving me and the other friend to pack up and travel back alone.

I’m at an age where I’m able to care for myself, but my parents take it to an absurd degree. So, just so I can pay for what I need, I have a job. However, they take half my earnings and say it’s because “they’re my parents, they deserve it”. That, plus me having to pay for my phone bill, leaves me with a rather small amount of money for me to have.

The other night, my family took me and my sisters out for dinner, since my older sister could come down from her college. We all eat, and have a generally good time until the check comes. My parents decided to pay for everybody **but** me. I had to pay for myself. So, naturally, I ask my parents about it. From there, the conversation escalates into a full-blown argument, which ends in them saying that I’m kicked out of the house. I say fine, and go to stay at a friend’s house for the night, hoping they didn’t mean it and will cool off by the next day.

The next day, I received a text from them saying that I needed to pick my things up from the house. I go to the house, and find all my stuff sitting on the front porch packed up. They were serious about their threat. My friend, being very nice, decided to let me stay at their house for the time being, until either I’m allowed back home, or I find someplace else.

It was also the day that I received my paycheck (it was resent since the first one bounced). When I go to get it, I find that my parents have cashed the WHOLE paycheck, not just the usual half they do. This obviously gets me more pissed off, and I go off on my parents again.

When I was 12 going on thirteen my mother lost custody of me and my older half-sister due to neglect and allowing her boyfriend at the time to ""make passes"" at my older sister (who wasn't even 16 at the time) and abuse me physically. He would leave bruises and welts all over me for the smallest things. For instance, during one summer when I was 11 I asked to go over to the neighbors house to play in their small pool. I was told yes at the time, but when I went back home I was punished for getting wet ""without permission"" when I had previously asked. I was beaten with a paddle and was almost hit with a dresser drawer that was thrown at me. Me and my sister were in and out of the system and had several open cases.

When I was thirteen my biological father got custody of me. My mother didn't attempt to fight for me or defend herself in court. My grandparents, who I had thought loved me, seemed ecstatic that I was leaving and rushed to get custody of my sister now that I was out of the picture. I found out later that my grandmother had called me ""a lot of work"" and my grandfather made me our to be a manipulative liar.

In the six years that I have been away from them, that haven't attempted to keep contact with me at all. My mother will send me money if I ask, but she's never payed official child support like she was supposed to. None of them even asked about my high school graduation.

23,1eu05zb,AITA for calling out my friend on his behaviour for our differences in beliefs?,"Hey everyone,

I'm in a dilemma and would love some outside perspective. A few days ago, I had what I thought was a casual conversation with a close friend. We started discussing politics, which then shifted to religion. I'm somewhat religious, while he's very much against it. I have no problem with his beliefs and totally respect them, and I thought he felt the same way about mine.

However, the conversation took a turn when he became insistent on proving me wrong. He kept pushing me to convince him of my beliefs, which felt strange to me because I never asked him to justify his views. I just shared my thoughts and left it at that. I found it rude when he suddenly said he was done arguing and didn't have the stamina anymore. I didn't even realize we were arguing—I thought we were just talking.

Things escalated when I lost my cool and called him out on some past instances where he struggled to handle opinions that differed from his. I asked him why I should have to prove anything to him in the first place. He responded by saying that, as a close friend, he feels it's his duty to ""enlighten"" me because I'm important to him. I found this logic pretty rubbish because I don't expect my friends to prove anything to me; I just respect their views, even if they're different from mine.

He then accused me of being aloof, full of myself, and emotionally disconnected because I don't care if my friends explain themselves to me. After this, he apologized and asked if we should set boundaries in our friendship, saying he'd follow whatever I decided. I was so frustrated at that point that I told him I didn't want to talk and needed some space.

Since then, we haven't spoken, and honestly, I'm not sure I want to anymore. He's been a close friend, but I don't feel like we're on the same level anymore.

24,1eu05um,AITA for not staying at a party I never wanted? ,"Before anything else, I want to apologize for mobile formatting and thank you to anyone who reads this.

I (19 M) am going to college (Large state polytech) in a week and a half with my sister (17 F). 
 I'm transferring from another college (Small 2 year tech school) and she's starting her first year there.

She and our mother (47 F) wanted to throw a party to celebrate that we were going away for college since they hadn't done it when I had gone to a local tech school for some reason. 

I am extremely anxious around crowds and have always had a dislike for large social gatherings (for example anything larger than 10 people) to the point that I used to regularly hide in small, inaccessible spots until said gathering was over. 

I also dislike attention or being the person a party is for as growing up being the center of attention was never a good thing and have learned to avoid this at all costs.  It got to a point that I have told friends I would prefer them not acknowledge my birthday at all instead of telling me happy birthday.  (This is something I am working on.)

My sister messed up when posting the invite on Facebook and had accidentally sent it to everyone in both her friends list as well as my mother's, ending up with 120+ people rsvp'ing for the party. 

It is an expensive party, as my mother insisted on preparing for the possibility of 120+ people actually showing up and I wasn't aware of the party until yesterday as I had been uninterested and I have memory issues that cause certain things to be forgotten easily. 

I came to help set up and realized that I didn't have to attend as most of the people there would most likely only be people my mother or sister knew (We were ""homeschooled""  and I never actually made friends aside from online ones) so I left an hour before the party actually began. 

As I left, my mother called me and told me that I was being rude for leaving before the party started and that people were coming to see me and hang out with me.  This made me remind her that I had no obligation to come since I'd never wanted a party and that she should know that since I'd never liked them.
 
She called me selfish and rude and then hung up. 

After I got home, I called my father (46 M) to explain and he told me ""You couldn't even be bothered to show up to your own party"" and hung up before I could explain.

I (19 M) am going to college (Large state polytech) in a week and a half with my sister (17 F). 
 I'm transferring from another college (Small 2 year tech school) and she's starting her first year there.

She and our mother (47 F) wanted to throw a party to celebrate that we were going away for college since they hadn't done it when I had gone to a local tech school for some reason. 

I am extremely anxious around crowds and have always had a dislike for large social gatherings (for example anything larger than 10 people) to the point that I used to regularly hide in small, inaccessible spots until said gathering was over. 

I also dislike attention or being the person a party is for as growing up being the center of attention was never a good thing and have learned to avoid this at all costs.

26,1etzsha,AITAH For being weirded out,"So my fiancé (34f)and I (45m) are sitting in a tattoo parlor, she's getting some ink done. I got her a session certificate for her birthday awhile back. 

Noticed she had this middle ring on that I hadn't seen before  in the 2 years we've been together. Cool ring, I commented on it. She's laying on her stomach (getting her tricep tatted) and lazily comments back from her prone position on the chair  ""teenage love"".

 OK, cool. So we're both single parents. I get that we both have histories. I'm grateful my kids were born, but I fathered children with the WRONG woman. I reserve no fondness whatsoever for my romantic history before my fiancé.

She feels much the same way about her exes. Her children's father is an absent POS. We both have said many times that we are each other's soul mate and best friend. Like, life before each other is a vague memory nearly forgotten. Our relationship to this point has been nothing short of AMAZING this far. Not quite perfect, but still infinitely better than anything we've experienced before. Like we were wasting time with other people, had we known fate had us waiting on each other.

However, we did have a disagreement yesterday that has yet to be resolved fully. We're affectionate and overall good today. Kisses and hugs and smiles after an awesome tattoo.

But, I can't help but be slightly insulted by what appears to be a token from a ""teenage love"" memory. And from everything she's told me over the course of our relationship thus far, she only really dated one person in high school and eventually married the father of her children. 

I'm so confused right now. She doesn't hate him in any way nor wishes no ill will on him because she has such a great heart. But everything I've understood about their relationship is that not long in, he became abusive and controlling as an alcoholic. And was out all night drinking and showed up at the hospital drunk with a buddy just minutes before their 2nd child was born. She divorced him not long after that. And, he has been completely absent form their children's lives pretty much ever since.

So why wear a momento piece of jewelery from a past relationship that was full of regret and emotional pain, and rather matter-of-factly refer to it as ""teenage love""? 

I mean, even if she was fond of the early part of their relationship when it was good... I mean, I'd never do something like that. Be fond, ok. Women are different that way. I get it. But I'm not going to wear anything that an ex bought me just because of all the bad memories with the ex (I always get rid of stuff like that anyway because of said bad memories, but I would CERTAINLY not wear it in front of my soul mate for there to be a chance for her to possibly feel insulted by it.

AITAH for feeling weird about this? Is she trolling me to get a reaction because of our aforementioned unresolved tiff?

For the ladies ITT: how do I approach her with clarification on what she meant by it or even what it is? It is her birthday this weekend, and I definitely don't want to ruin my birthday plans for her by bringing this up TODAY, but I'm afraid this is going to gnaw on me. And if and when I do try to lovingly approach her about it in a non-attacking way, is she going to say I'm being petty?

My husband “was layed off” (unemployment confirmed he quit 😒) from his $20+ hour job. For the last month and a half he has either been unemployed or only making $11. Together we have 5 kids. With roughly 4k+ in monthly bills. 
I have had the same job since 9/2023 (not long but long enough and only part time bc it worked around his schedule) making $15+ an hour. (My job was meant for two reason. 1. To get me out of the house. 2. To make extra spending money for me and the kids during the day.) Maybe help with bills if he forgot.(okay maybe three reasons)

So for the last month not only have we been *barely* living off my $15 hour 27.5 hours a week. He hasn’t paid or attempted to help with any bills.   But he’s not even helping with household obligations. And in the event he doesn’t pawn things off to my 12 year old son, he just complains that he did something once (like household duties aren’t a daily thing). He complains that he has to take care of the toddlers during the day (because he wants to play video games because he never gets a break like this) he’s always finding other things to do and places to go in which I feels like he’s avoiding helping with any of our kids. For example: it’s 4:45pm my 12 year old had a quiz to take after school and I had to shower before work. Leaving our 5,3,2. Husband decided he had to do something outside attempting to leave the three littles in the care of the 12 year old. The thing he had to do outside was up the road (we live country blocks away from people not city) it would have left the three littles with out an adult for about 30-hour with the oldest WHILE TAKING A QUIZ. The littles could have been with him in the truck (like every other time) and I was the shitty person for telling him he shouldn’t be leaving the littles with the 12 especially while he’s taking a test for school. 

I’m extremely stretched thin. I’ve exhausted all outlets of extra money I can think of. Without going into huge detail on other matters. I handle ALL paperwork, all grocery shopping, all party planning , all school things (on top of being a full time student myself)

We met in highschool and have been together ever since. This October on Halloween will make 4 years of engagement. Now onto the situation.. 

My mother is very bad at managing her money. For context when my dad ( 61 M) met her she had 13 credit cards maxed out. I was 17 when my dad paid her last one off. Currently she has 3 credit cards almost fully maxed yet again, my parents are separated but not legally divorced yet. 

In the beginning I agreed to pay 50$ for my share of the storage unit as my items are currently stored inside. But due to her outrageous financial demands of me it's starting to hurt me and my future with my fianceé. I have full access to the storage unit any time because I was given a key. My fiance's parents are more than happy to let my store my things in one of their spare rooms for free. My mother is a classic victim mentality narcissist, if something doesn't go her way it's the fault of someone else and never her own. That being said I want to move ALL my things out of the storage unit before I tell her that I will no longer be paying for it. because it's pretty common for her to find a way to block me and make my life hell for trying to get away. My plan is to go on a weekend when she's gone visiting another guy she's been seeing (long story) and pack my things and move them elsewhere. Then once it's moved I can drop the bombshell on her that I will no longer be paying for it. 

Any time I bring up money she brings up the fact I supposedly owe her 1500$ which I have long since paid off not to mention my mom made a deal with my dad that every time her student loan comes out of his account the amount is taken off my 'Dept' she conveniently keeps forgetting to change it.

I love mom to bits as she’s always been there for me, even financially when I know she can’t afford. We’re super close, however, ever since I turned 17, she changed, seemingly since I’ve become independent. We have different body types; she’s unhealthily skinny, HAS to work out daily & her diet is bad. I’ve seen her run on just a bowl of cereal for a day. It’s bad. 
I’ve always had wide shoulders, went to a school with a uniform policy, so got bullied for looking wide AF in my blazer. As an adult, I have E-cup boobs & hourglass figure. I’m curvy, work out often, a vegetarian, & keep myself healthy. This doesn’t stop her from saying, as if I’m obese, “When you’re so big you can’t move, don’t come crying to me!” It’s to the point where our family friends have told her she’s being mean it’s that bad. She brought that exact phrase up bc we were arguing over it & our family were like “yeah, that’s mean AF.” She also has a bit of a complex to do with chores. Saying things like “I’m always doing everything!”. She’s done it since I was about 15? When I was younger it made me feel really guilty bc obviously I couldn’t DO everything. Now that I’m 20, I do everything I can to help. I’m a university student, just finished my freshman year, so only home in seasonal holidays, but I lived in the dorms, & developed so much individuality/independence. I also met my long term partner, we’ll call him D. Mom LOVES D, but again, she does little things like mention my weight in front of him (he doesn’t care about that) & gets upset when *I* get annoyed, or will call or text me when me and D are out on a date.
Anyway, current day - this is what happened tonight (paraphrased). My job allows me to work seasonally when I’m home as part of my contract, & I’m working a 40 hour work week so I can afford rent for a student house, not just a dorm. Mom works from home.
I worked a 7-12pm today, then had to go out. I get home at 3, play some games, end up napping at 4, wake up at 6. Mom’s cooked dinner! Great. I go downstairs, this happens.

Me: Hi! That smells good.
Mom: Convenient that you only get up once I’ve cooked.
Me: (knowing this is gonna go bad) OK.
I ask her halfway through dinner,

Me: What’s wrong?
Mom: I just do everything.
Me: I disagree, but OK.
Mom: I clean this house daily!
Me: You do! But I cook often & do our laundry on top of work. You do a lot of our chores because it’s convenient that you’re home. 
Mom: Well if I didn’t, who would?
Me: OK. 

I start getting mad by this point, so I walk away. We usually end up arguing, but instead I very nonchalantly said to her, “At least I move away again in 2 weeks. Then you might be happy.” This sends her CRAZY, she’s yelling at me, she’s pissed, but she makes me feel very small when she comments on me, and I wanted her to feel that.

Mom: I clean this house daily!
Me: You do! But I cook often & do our laundry on top of work. You do a lot of our chores because it’s convenient that you’re home. 
Mom: Well if I didn’t, who would?
Me: OK. 

I start getting mad by this point, so I walk away. We usually end up arguing, but instead I very nonchalantly said to her, “At least I move away again in 2 weeks. Then you might be happy.” This sends her CRAZY, she’s yelling at me, she’s pissed, but she makes me feel very small when she comments on me, and I wanted her to feel that.

31,1etybco,AITA for making friend laugh during lifting,"Hey guys. 

I occasionally go to the gym and lift weights with my sister. She's pretty dedicated and would like her workout to be serious. We talk a lot and make normal banter as you do. We both make jokes and make each other laugh. Sometimes these jokes just happen to be during a set. 

Thing is, she just told me she no longer wants to work out with me. She tells me that she has goals for her lifting, and that i'm ruining it for her. She told me that i'm not being serious enough about it and she wants me to stop making her laugh during a set. I think i've had it happen maybe 5 times over the course of 2 months. It has been so few times, that i dont remember much of it though. I really am not doing it intentionally, it sorta just happens when the conversation flows. 

The decision is final though. She already made plans to work out with someone else. I feel a little hurt over the comment. 

Am I really in the wrong here? I see the point in taking things seriously, but our workout were fine. It didn't stop her from completing the sets, it just paused it a little. As in, does pausing a set really hurt your gains that much? Is there something i don't know here? Am I the asshole for ""ruining"" her workout?

My daughter told Jake that she doesn’t have student loans because she is smart then him and he’s just jealous because he has never had the courage to do anything except be miserable take in dead in jobs and live with his mommy until the age of 40

This was my daughter going away party and my sister grabbed her gift and started calling my daughter ungrateful and Jake called my daughter the C word. A man older than her says that to a teenager. I told Jake and my sister to get the fuck out of my home and not come back. I told Anna she doesn’t ever have to apologize and make herself smaller for people like Jake. Fuck people like him.

34,1etxqlw,"AITA for not offering to pay for my boyfriend's car repair costs, even though he drives us around often?","Hi there, I (29F) currently live with my boyfriend (35M). We've lived together for \~2 years now, and we both have our own cars.

We can both drive, and when we do drive ourselves anywhere, we usually take our own respective cars. However, since we live together and hang out a lot, we usually end up having to drive to the same destinations together -- whether it be to get groceries, supplies, etc. He usually will drive us in those instances, because I don't like driving and he's OK with driving us. He will also offer to pick me up from places when I hang out without him. Occasionally I'll ask for a ride, but I always tell him I can drive myself or take an uber if he doesn't want to drive. I never drive his car without him, ever.

We split our living expenses 50/50. Boyfriend makes significantly less than I do, but he's never asked me to pay more than 50/50, even when I've offered. I think he is too prideful to take money from me. \*\*\* That being said though\*\*\*, I do send him half a tank's cost of gas everytime he fills and I'm with him (which is 90% the time). He, however, is struggling financially (CC debt, student loans). His car needs a \~$2.5K repair, and he is upset about it. AITA if I don't offer to help split the repair costs? It feels wrong because he drives us around a lot, but he also has never asked me to drive and is OK with driving. He is not asking me for help.

More financial background about us: He comes from a wealthy family. His parents help his sister (37F) with her expenses occasionally. He refuses to ask his parents or his family for any financial help, also I think due to being too prideful. I do not come from any money, and all money I have is everything that I've earned myself. Because I come from such a low-income background/family, I always feel like I have to save every penny I have, just in case I have to survive on my own and I have no job, etc.

TLDR; Boyfriend and I both drive and have our own cars but he drives us around a lot, without asking for anything in return and I sometimes pay gas $$ just because I feel like I should. AITA for not offering to help pay for his $2.5K car repair bill?

Thank you..!!

They are all of Asian descent and one of them is an international student, I am the only white guy. Recently a lot of the time when hanging out as we do they will exclusively talk to each other in Cantonese which is a language I don’t speak which of course makes me feel quite excluded, I ask why and one of them says that it’s because our international student friend isn’t very good with English. In my mind I’d think that if you were to study academically in English you’d be fairly competent at conversing and therefore we would all be able to speak in a language we all understand.

This same friend who said that will then get furious if I speak to one of the other friends in Japanese because we both know that language because apparently it’s “rude”. 

Would I be the asshole to call them out for excluding me? Or am I just being over dramatic? I don’t have anything against them speaking Cantonese but I do feel excluded from anything especially when they want me to hang out and then 95% of the time converse in something I can reciprocate in.

We were planning to do a big reconstruction within 6–9 months, and our tenants just moved out, it would not make sense to look for new ones also I'm still at college So we needed to save money. We both love animals. I have a small dog (14) And He recently Lost a cat. We knew that we couldn't have a new pet: we would move to a small flat (because of our budget) and I have an older dog. And it is difficult to find a place with a pet - owners usually choose people without pets here and having one pet already puts us at a disadvantage.
Mother of BF finds a cat one day and decides to keep him. They already have two cats and they do not get along- he attacks them. So she asks if we could keep him till they find him a new home. So I said yes - we have a free room he can have all for himself. We did have a talk about this because of course i thought this might happen and he literaly promised we wouldn't keep him.

Then he could use every room, also the downstairs corridor, so dog couldn't go there anymore- cat would attack him. Later, BF started to let him in the kitchen which meant he could go everywhere. Dog was scared of him after he attacked him multiple times (for cat reasons). So I expressed my concerns about his health because he's old and I don't want him stressed all the time. So he would let him there only if he was in the room, and he would keep him out of the living room so the dog can have at least one room for himself only.

Later that night, I was talking to Bob's parents over the phone and Bob's mom asked me if I would be buying a dress beforehand or where the wedding will be held. I mentioned that I was planning to get a semi-formal dress for a friend’s wedding that I could also wear to Peter and Lana’s wedding.

40,1etwleo,AITA for arguing with my mum?,"Before I begin, I'd like it to be known that I'm in the waiting list for an autism assessment and I have quite severe OCD which effects the way I touch things, feel things and the way I think about certain things. I have had meltdowns over the way socks feel with specific pairs of shoes, or how my hair feels on my neck.

I've always had a huge issue with bras, I developed breasts very early (earlier than 10 yrs old) and have never liked bras. I've tried countless amounts of them on to try to find a reliable one, however the moment its on my skin I feel like crying, it's so uncomfortable that I immediately remove it. I used to be forced to wear one to school, but it was so uncomfortable that I would often pull it up above my breasts so the discomfort went away. It isnt just physical discomfort, I feel tearful and disgusting everytime I wear one or even think of them.

For about a year now, my mum has been absolutely focused on convincing me to wear one. She keeps telling me things such as ""They will make your breasts look smaller, it will make others more comfortable, you need to support your breasts, you will have a nicer figure."" She's dragged me into many shops with other people to attempt to get the other person to convince me to purchase one and has even shouted at me in public for not wanting one. Long story short, she REALLY wants me to buy a bra.

Things bubbled up massively today on the way to the pub. Me, my mum and my dad were walking along together, my mum was acting a bit off, looking at me strangely and making passive aggressive comments about my shoes. Suddenly, she (very loudly) exclaimed that I ""Had to get used to wearing a bra."" Our conversation went how it usually does (lots of back and fourth) until I asked why she bought it up infront of my dad and in public. She didnt reply. 

I knew that the pub trip was going to be awkward, so I turned to walk back home. As I did, my dad told me to ""stop sulking"" and that ""if I was going to come with them, i would have to lighten up."" My mum also added that ""if I kept talking about this topic she would send me home herself."" To that I simply walked home, feeling incredibly self conscious of my chest.

Now I'm at home and thinking about everytime we've fought about this issue. Nobody other than her has ever bought up my chest, and I've never caught anybody looking at it. Simply the thought of the fabric and the feeling of my chest being trapped makes my skin prickle, however I hear constantly that ""mother knows best"" and she keeps repeating that its for my own good. I feel bad about walking away, but I was so conscious of my chest that I didnt want to be in public any longer.

41,1etwdgy,AITA for telling my dad that he’s effectively made me homeless?,"I (22M) moved out of my dad’s house around 1.5 years ago. The deal he made with me was that I could always come back home if I was struggling too much financially (I’m a university student and also working full-time). My lease ends on September 1st and since around July, he and I have been under agreement that I can move back in with him starting in September. 

Fast forward to today. He texts me out of the blue and says that his current girlfriend isn’t okay with me living there and that I’ll need to figure something else out. Her reasoning was that she didn’t want to have to hear me in the basement late at night since I get off work super late (I would’ve been quiet; the most noise would’ve been the alarm going off for 5 seconds when I opened the door). He told me this 2 weeks before my lease is up. I tried to make a case for myself and told my father that we’ve been in agreement for MONTHS that I could move back in, but he’s still refusing. I told him he just effectively made me homeless, and that if I had known sooner that I couldn’t move back in, I would’ve looked for somewhere else. He told me I needed to grow up and handle this like an adult, to figure out my own problems. As it stands, most landlords aren’t even renting out for September 1st at this point. I’ll have to find a place for October 1st.

43,1etvwwi,AITA- For attending a concert with my Ex to celebrate Father’s Day ? ,"To provide some context: My ex and are legally married but have been separated for over 2 years now. We have both moved on. My current partner and I have known each other for over a decade and things moved pretty quickly when we reconnected at the start of 2023. We started dating exclusively in Feb, made it official in May, moved in together by Nov. My ex has also moved on and now has a child resulting from his relationship. 

So ffwd to May 2024, Facebook randomly has a sponsored ad and I see that one of my ex’s favorite rappers will be in a nearby city the day before Father’s Day. The tickets were only $30 and I felt like it would be a perfect gift for him. Side bar: He’s an AMAZING FATHER and my gf will attest to that. At the time of the concert my ex is single, somewhat of a loner so he has a very small social circle. The artist is B list and I know he might have a hard time finding a plus 1. I also enjoy this artist and my ex is truly one of my best friends but I do know my gf is very insecure about the fact that we’re still legally married. So before purchasing 2 tickets I asked how she’d feel IF he asked me to go bc I’d only buy 1 ticket to eliminate that as a possibility. She says it’s fine (reluctantly). I lie to my ex and tell him I have plans the day of the concert so he knows I’m not an option. 

I bought the tickets end of April. May was very rough, my gf and I were having issues communicating and prioritizing our mental health which lead to her breaking up with me and spending multiple nights out with “friends” that she just met… when I say multiple nights out, she’d leave the house at 5pm and not return until 5am and even as late as 9am one morning. The time she stayed out until 9am it was revealed that she stayed night at a random man’s house that she barely knew. I was bothered by the situation, understandably but also accepting that she had dumped me and didn’t owe me anything. We were supposed to be working to fix things and her preference was to be out drinking and avoiding the issues at home. Now it’s June and it’s the day of the concert… I asked my ex who was going with him to the concert. He explained how everyone he invited bailed on him last min and he was attending alone. So I decided to join him. I let her know I was going to the concert and of course she was very upset about it but I went anyway. 


She feels disrespected that I even asked her to begin with. I feel like it could have all been avoided if she would have just told me to buy the 1 ticket. Sooooo am I the asshole ?

About a year ago, I started dating my boyfriend (21M). Things were going well, but two months into our relationship, he got fired, had no savings, and was burdened with several debts.

To help him out, I lent him money for at least seven months to cover his living expenses. I even managed to get him a job at my office after pleading with my manager.

He started working, and occasionally, I would ask when he could pay me back. He made promises but ended up unable to repay me due to urgent matters, which I understood. I never got angry when he couldn’t repay me, and I even lent him more money at times.

Today, I politely asked him how much he could repay me this month. He promised to pay me back but said he wasn't sure how much yet because he needed to calculate his bills. I asked him a few more times, and eventually, he responded with an angry tone.

I asked him why he was upset, and he angrily replied that it was because I was pressuring him to answer. Hearing this, I started crying. After a while, I explained that I really needed the money, and even if he couldn’t pay me back, I wouldn’t be angry, just like before. But this time, he was really angry and raised his voice.

I asked him, ""Isn’t it usually the person who’s owed money who gets angry?"" But he continued to raise his voice and said, ""I never said you couldn’t be angry.

So basically my mom (F 48) has a friend(F20-40) that I’ve NEVER met before (online friend even though she gets so mad anytime I even think about maybe getting an online friend) and she’s going to be in town for a few days and needs a place to sleep, (Note: I have to sleep on the couch) so she immediately gets MY room. I told her, No, I don’t want someone sleeping in MY room that I haven’t even met, I also don’t want her sleeping at the house in general. And my mom just told me oh well. We’ve been in a huge fight all day and I want to know others opinions. This is happening Monday. I feel really sick right now and I’m kind of a cry baby so I’m crying. I just don’t want her in my bed, it’s bad enough she’s staying in the house, but on MY bed and I have to sleep on the couch? I feel like I’m being the absurd one here, but tbh I just want to know if I’m in the wrong. We’ve been fighting all day, and I just want her to not come. Just for clarification, none of us have EVER met her. My brother (M28) doesn’t want her here either, and I feel like my mom and her friend are being selfish by insisting she sleeps on MY bed. And also, each of us have personal bathrooms, with a bathroom downstairs for everyone. My mom wants her to use MY personal bathroom, which has personal items in it such as feminine products, and although she is a women too, she seems like the type to judge me for using tampons at a young age. I have no choice in this but… AITA?

I’ll update when something happens.

EDIT 1: My mum DOES NOT know her irl either, they met on Facebook, have talked 3 or 4 times, the friend has to do something for her work in the big city an hour away for a few days and instead of getting a hotel, she needs to sleep in my bed.

EDIT 2: Wow, lots of arguments, also, Hi people watching this as a cringey Reddit Am I the asshole story lol, anyway, I understand that it’s ’traditional’ and I might just be overacting, but I’m 
Still a child. 13 is not old at all. I don’t think I should be forced to give up my room to a stranger who could possible be a sex offender.

EDIT 3: Wowza! There are a lot of wide opinions on this topic. For the people calling me a troll, why? I don’t understand what I would be doing to troll. Now that that’s out of the way…

Why the crap do you guys think it’s okay to yell at me for something you misread? Yikes. Please re read the post and my comments and stop being mean please, I’m looking for advice not someone being rude.

EDIT 4: My mum thinks it’s because of the couch (it’s most definitely not) so now I’m staying in her room with her. Ugh. I’m fine with that but it’s going to be hot and sweaty and I still want my room back.

EDIT 5:  So my mum is even more mad at me. So she stormed into my room, sat in my bed while I was crying and was telling me I better get my effing room cleaned, and I told her how I felt she wasn’t respecting my boundaries and she said well she already committed and I’m just being like this because I don’t want to clean my room (definitely the reason uh huh) bro I’m so done with this, I would lock my door but I don’t have a lock.

Edit 7: btw we have an air mattress, i brought this up and my mom said that she needs a PRIVATE SPACE. So i dont get one, but this rando does? tf?

EDIT 8: So this really doesnt apply here, but, i take ballet classes, and for some reason i was showing my mom the worm, and she said ""do you do that in ballet?"" i can't stop laughing

Am I (13F) the one wrong here? 
So basically my mom (F 48) has a friend(F20-40) that I’ve NEVER met before (online friend even though she gets so mad anytime I even think about maybe getting an online friend) and she’s going to be in town for a few days and needs a place to sleep, (Note: I have to sleep on the couch) so she immediately gets MY room. I told her, No, I don’t want someone sleeping in MY room that I haven’t even met, I also don’t want her sleeping at the house in general. And my mom just told me oh well. We’ve been in a huge fight all day and I want to know others opinions. This is happening Monday. I feel really sick right now and I’m kind of a cry baby so I’m crying. I just don’t want her in my bed, it’s bad enough she’s staying in the house, but on MY bed and I have to sleep on the couch? I feel like I’m being the absurd one here, but tbh I just want to know if I’m in the wrong. We’ve been fighting all day, and I just want her to not come. Just for clarification, none of us have EVER met her. My brother (M28) doesn’t want her here either, and I feel like my mom and her friend are being selfish by insisting she sleeps on MY bed. And also, each of us have personal bathrooms, with a bathroom downstairs for everyone. My mom wants her to use MY personal bathroom, which has personal items in it such as feminine products, and although she is a women too, she seems like the type to judge me for using tampons at a young age. I have no choice in this but… AITA?

I’ll update when something happens.

EDIT 1: My mum DOES NOT know her irl either, they met on Facebook, have talked 3 or 4 times, the friend has to do something for her work in the big city an hour away for a few days and instead of getting a hotel, she needs to sleep in my bed.

EDIT 2: Wow, lots of arguments, also, Hi people watching this as a cringey Reddit Am I the asshole story lol, anyway, I understand that it’s ’traditional’ and I might just be overacting, but I’m 
Still a child. 13 is not old at all. I don’t think I should be forced to give up my room to a stranger who could possible be a sex offender.

49,1etv3wp,AITA if I (37 F) don’t take care of my exes (42 M) kids when he’s taking his new girlfriend (29) on a birthday trip? ,"A little background: My ex cheated on me with multiple people. I’ll spare all the details but in short got one of them pregnant (a 22F coworker of mine) and left me for her. She immediately moved in with him and his kids. She didn’t keep the baby and after a year left him because she didn’t like his kids and didn’t want to be a mom to his two daughters (14 and 12). 

I, however, adore his girls, and they love me. I’ve known them for 5 years now. I’ve been the only stable woman in their lives. (Their mom loves them and tries her best but has a mental disorder and is in and out of mental institutions every few months.) I stayed in contact with them after the breakup and have gotten even closer to them since all this.

Fast forward to now, he’s currently dating a girl who wants a big trip for her 30th birthday, so he’s neglected bills (including one with my name on it) to take her to NYC for 5 days. In fact, he’s supposed to be evicted the day he leaves. 

She has resented my presence since day 1 and wants me out of the picture. I’m not even saying I don’t understand bc I’m his ex, but she also knew the girls and I are super close before they started dating. 

Two weeks ago the ex, the gf, and I were at a mutual friend’s birthday. We kept our distance except at the end when I said hello and asked if he was dropping the girls off the next day or if I was picking them up because I was taking them to an amusement park. She said he and I could talk about it later and grabbed his hand and said they’re leaving and dragged him off. Then this week I was dropping something off for the girls and was made to abruptly leave bc she was coming over and she’d be in a bad mood the rest of the night if she knew I had been there. 

All this brings us to today. The mom had to leave again and will now not be here to watch the girls when he goes on the trip. (Although, when he booked this trip a month ago, she wasn’t going to be around and he had no plan to begin with.) No surprise, he wants me to help out. One the one hand, the girls would be happiest with me. It’s the easiest solution, I’m the only one close to their school, and I love my time with them. However, she hates any interaction I have with them. I have to tiptoe around to not upset her, but now that they’re in a bind, it’s so great I’m around because it helps her out? None of it sits well with me.

50,1etukoj,AITA for trying to respect my dead dad's wishes and receive his money in his bank account as his beneficiary?,"My father passed extremely unexpectedly in the beginning of this year, and I (17 F) am his bank accounts' beneficiary. 

He created the account a little over two years ago, and I was with him when he did so. While setting it up he placed me as his bank's beneficiary and told me to make sure none of his money went to my mom if and when he passed. My mom is a chronic online gambler and wastes, I would have to guess, thousands on it every month on just THAT alone. She also has a terrible shopping addiction and will buy anything she likes regardless of the price. She's a hard worker who brings home 3k+ every two weeks and can never make it last. So this is why he never wanted her to receive it. 

Today, we got into a huge argument over his bank account. She came to me saying I need to come down to the bank with her and close out his account sometime. After telling me this I asked her if I would be getting the money (BECAUSE I AM THE BENEFICIARY). I don't want the money to go blow on something idiotic like I know she would. 

I love my dad literally more than anything, and wanted the money to keep some as a memento and some to go towards buying my first house. Using part of his money for a house makes me feel like he was here and apart of that accomplishment. 

This made her blow up. Immediately yelling and screaming saying that l'm a ""clueless spoiled brat"" and that ""she deserves it more than anyone"". Her reasoning being that the money that is in there is hers that she had sent him before he passed. Let me mention now that there's no more than 1k at absolute most in there, so it's not like it's a huge extreme life changing amount. I know she can't get the money without me, but I feel guilty.

I also have a stepdaughter (7F) from my marriage to my husband (38M), and she desperately wants to come. However, the thing is, she has a history of not behaving at birthday parties. She acts younger than her age and doesn’t understand social cues. She’s been invited to three of her classmates birthday parties in the past. At one of those parties, she blew out the candles, and at the other two parties, she started crying when she wasn’t able to blow out the candles. Eventually people stopped inviting her to their parties, and she claims it makes her feel left out.

I decided it would be best if my stepdaughter didn’t come. She would either blow out the candles or have a tantrum, and either way she would ruin the day for my daughter. My husband is furious with me, saying I’m deliberately excluding her for being autistic. He says she already feels excluded from her classmates parties, but excluding her from her own stepsister’s party would be even more cruel. I told him it was my daughter’s special day, and I had to prioritise her feelings first.

54,1etubuo,WIBTA if I told my coworker to get an Uber instead of always asking us for rides?,"I (26F) and a PhD student. The lab I’m in has three other PhD students: Tiffany (early 30sF), Mark (mid 20sM), and Helen (mid 20sF). I’m the only one who’s local, and the others are from other countries.

Our mentor wants us to do things out of the lab to bond, but it’s been… difficult. A not insignificant part of this is because Helen keeps suggesting expensive things.

For example: the first thing she suggested was going out to eat at a restaurant and pressured us to get an upgrade making the total $35 each before the tip. I’m used to going places where two or even three can eat for that price. And I wasn't the only one not happy with the cost, since the other two also voiced it.

She also wanted to go to a water park about an hour away with a $60 ticket price and $30 for parking. I suggested going to the beach instead (we’re on a lake and there’s a fair amount of free beeches through the national park system) but she insisted on the park. Luckily I was able to get us out of that thanks to the weather forecast.

But the main problem I’m having with this is that she doesn’t drive. Doesn’t have a car doesn’t know how. And every suggestion she’s made feels like they’re places she wants to go but doesn’t have a ride to.

She suggested we go out for Mark and Tiffany's birthdays, but she decided the place and assumed we were going there until I pointed out that the people whose birthdays we were celebrating should get to pick. She also wanted to go in the middle of the work day, which would make our lunch break at least 2 hours long. I pointed this out, and she kept saying we should do it anyway until I told her flat out I wasn't comfortable doing that. This is ignoring the fact that she wanted to do this when we would all be busy with preparing to submit an abstract for a conference.

She also invited herself (and Mark and I) over Tiffany's when she heard she was moving. Then again insisted someone would have to give her a ride. I checked with Tiffany on the side that she actually was ok with us coming over, fully planning to try and find an excuse to cancel the whole thing if she said no.

Every time we talk about going somewhere the first thing she brings up is her need for a ride.

It would be more understandable if there was no other option. But the city we’re in has a pretty good transit system which students get free access to. And Lyft/Uber rides are also easy to find in the area at a reasonable price.

So WIBTA if I pointed out she could use those? She doesn't ever ask, just says that someone will need to give her a ride and assumes we will. I understand she might just be trying to make a friend group, but I feel like she isn't considering us in what she wants to do, just herself.

Obviously this goes beyond just the ride thing, but I feel between one or the other it's the easier battle to pick, because the three of us have voiced it to her before but she doesn't seem to get it.

55,1etu3w7,AITAH for questioning my friend’s anxiety over a guy ,"
Let’s call my friend Sarah. Sarah has recently decided to start seriously dating with the usage of dating apps and shares her stories about the type of guys she meets etc. with me. 

She recently had a meltdown over a guy named Tom because he was taking too long to reply to her messages and she ended up calling him out over it and this is where the conflict starts. Let me first share what I know of her relationship with Tom to provide some context:

1) Tom and Sarah have gone out on one date but he never asked to have a second date with her 
2) Tom has said that he was not looking for anything serious to begin with which is something that Sarah wants
3) Sarah herself has admitted to me that she doesn’t know what kind of relationship she has with Tom. She admits that she can’t even call him a friend and that they’re in a weird talking stage. 

When Sarah was having her meltdown over Tom via text to me and saying that he was giving her so much anxiety, I started questioning her on why she was melting down over a guy that ‘doesn’t matter’. Because in my eyes, the fact that Tom doesn’t respond to her texts actively makes me feel like he’s just not interested and is waiting for the conversation to die. I kept on saying that I found it really off that she was here caring so much about a guy who isn’t texting her fast enough when there already isn’t a future with him to begin with. There was a constant back and forth between us and she was getting more and more defensive and saying that she doesn’t get why I’m being so critical over her being anxious when Tom has already apologized for taking so long to reply. I eventually apologized for making her feel that way when I was more concerned about her melting down over guys that don’t really matter because this is a constant pattern. But I can tell that even though she has accepted my apology, she has been super cold with me since then",Not the A-hole,2024-08-16,"AITAH for questioning my friend’s anxiety over a guy

56,1ettwni,AITA for donating family money to charity?,"So I (32M) together with my two brothers and nephew were given a good sum of money recently from an aunt. Just to be clear, she is still fine.

My aunt has no next of kin and chose to donate to all the children in the family equally.   
I've never been comfortable receiving large sums of money from people as it puts a strange unspoken expectation between parties.

*Maybe this part is a bit in my head, but similar things (not money related) did happen in the past.*

I told my aunt I was grateful for the gesture but did not want it, however, she refused to take it back.   
I ended up donating it to a non-profit that helps underprivileged children (literal translation from my language, not sure if it's the correct English word for it.) 

A few weeks later, my brothers found out, and they were livid I chose to give away my aunts' money. If I did not want it, I should just have given it to them. (keep in mind, they all got the same amount)

58,1ett32s,AITA for not supporting someone who’s grieving? ,"
I 18m had a very close friend group with 3 other guys but in this situation only two of them matter. I’ll call them Adam and Ben. 

Ben I would have considered to be a very good friend, but long story short he went crazy for this girl, literally cut out everyone in his life because all he cared about was her, like no one else ever saw him at all, he wouldn’t answer any messages and he wasn’t even in the group chats any more etc

 Then he broke up with her leaving him with no friends and nobody and he’s come crawling back to us and even tho we weren’t his only friends we were the closest and I think his only option for people that might want to speak to me after being a bad friend for a year so in terms of people in his life he doesn’t have many. Also right now his dad has just died unexpectedly. 

Ben seemed to immediately rekindle things with the other pair but I can’t be bothered with those types of people so I’ve declined when he’s asked to hang out/catch up and I immediately let any text conversation die. 

Adam tho had a conversation with me about how him and Ben had some deep conversation and Bens really not doing great rn, on top of the whole dead dad thing he’s also feeling REALLY isolated apparently.

 So Adam asked that I at least give him something, because we did use to be really close friends me and Ben and even if we won’t be that again, to put in a little effort like when we hang out in a group to speak to him because last time I was kinda not giving him any attention. 

And I said to be honest Ben is a  good person it’s not like I can’t tolerate him or even dislike his personality or anything but he brought this all on himself and to me it feels wrong to give him something he wants if that makes sense. Gotta accept the consequences for your own mistakes and all that 

Adam hearing that went kinda off at me about pettiness which is apparently what I’m being and to sum it all up basically it’s wrong I’m not trying to help him during a rough time. ",Asshole,2024-08-16,"AITA for not supporting someone who’s grieving?

60,1etsgnu,AITA for not paying rent to my bf? ,"Summary: I am f22, my bf is m30. I am still at university and was working as an intern until last month. I also still work as a freelance journalist. Still my bf makes about 6x as much as I make. We’ve been together for 5 years and just recently moved into our first apartment. Now his sister was subtly calling me the asshole for not paying any rent. 

My boyfriend and I have never cared much about money. When I met him he was a student himself, working at McDonalds or was unemployed. He would pick me up with his mom’s car. I’m far from a gold digger. We’ve been with each other since we were kids and truly love each other. Now he makes good money and our dream of moving in together could come true. Since I am younger than him, I’m still at university and I have worked as an intern for a newspaper for the past 1.5 years on top of that. 
My boyfriend pays the rent alone and pays for most other expenses as well. Not because I tell him to but because he likes it. He likes to provide for me and we want to get married anyway. We don’t think of money as my money vs. your money. I love this man a lot and want to bear his children. 

The relationship to his family has always been a bit strange. I think just because they are strange people. Also, from what he told me I know that he’s been emotionally neglected as a boy, while his sister was always put on a pedestal. It still is that way today. 

Yesterday she came over and her and I talked for a long time. I actually thought it was going great since we’ve never really spoken that much before. She then started to give me advice out of nowhere, advice I hadn’t asked for. She is 35 and has been with her bf for a long time as well. It started subtly by her telling me to always stay on top of laundry etc. 

I didn’t think it was strange at that point and just went along with it, also telling her how happy I was with her brother and what a great man he is. 

But then she went on to say: “Don’t you ever ask yourself what you bring to the table? Don’t you ever feel worthless?” She elaborated saying that she has in the past felt that way when her boyfriend was earning more than she was. She told me to definitely pay him rent because everything involving money would just lead to issues and also said i should “find something i’m good at and if i can’t, get good at something, as for example practicing how to cook”. 
FYI I never said I couldn’t cook or that I was overwhelmed with the housework or that I felt like I wasn’t good enough for my bf. 

i didn’t really realize while we were still having the conversation but once she left I was really hurt. Was she implying I’m a gold digger? She said I was lazy. Is she telling me it’s unfair to my bf that i’m not paying rent? Is it unfair to him that i’m not working this month? Is she saying I’m not good enough for him? 
I’m very hurt and I’m wondering: AITA? Or is it none of her business? I’d love some opinions!

Her wounds where also looked after by the nurse an an ambulance was already called.

After that I stayed a little longer until the ambulance came to pick the lady up just to be sure she's taken care of, then I left.
Now to the reason I post this.
I was just waiting for the ambulance and I feel like I am like those people who just watch and do nothing, which is punishable. I couldn't do more because as far as I know everything was already done to help but I still feel guilty. 
If it is possible I would like to have some advice what the right way to act is,  if I come across such a situation again.

I try to avoid visiting my mother in law’s house because she has several habits that can be dangerous to my son. She picks her nose, goes to the bathroom and doesn’t wash her hands afterwards, coughs without covering her mouth, cooks without washing her hands and sometimes even picks her nose while cooking (and obviously doesn’t wash her hands). 

About two months ago me and my son ate at her house. She didn’t eat anything so I started to get worried. She told me she had diarrhea and had been throwing up. I immediately stopped eating and told my kid to stop eating. I threw the food away. She called me over protective and told me to stop being dramatic.
I explained to her that my son already has terrible health issues that SHE IS AWARE OF and that him getting sick is the last thing I want. She just told us to leave. Before leaving I told her that keeping everything sterile, going to work, cooking and being a caring parent is not an easy job and that she should try that herself before judging the way I care about my son. 

Two days later my son and I have vomit and diarrhea. I wasn’t that sick but my son was in extreme pain and in terrible condition. He had to stay in his hospital room almost 2 weeks. Not a single call or message from her.
Luckily about a week ago my son got better. 

Yesterday she invited us over but I refused to go. I told her that she put my son in a dangerous situation and that we are not ready to see her again. She called me an asshole and told me to call her after I visit a therapist that helps me with my “germophobia”. 
I feel like an asshole for cutting her off and making her feel gross but I’m so tired of working so hard. I’m exhausted. I work so hard just for my work to be thrown down the drain by my own “family”. Sometimes I even question if what I’m doing is right. Sometimes I feel like they’re right.

The problem is, she can’t stand the sight of ants, and when the traps start attracting them, she gets really upset. Now, she’s insisting we hire an exterminator. 

Personally, I feel like they’ll just do the same thing I’m doing—spray and set traps—but charge us hundreds of dollars more each month. Plus, the ants will still be drawn to the traps. It’s now begging to cause issues in our marriage, and I find it ridiculous for her to get so worked up over something so small, no pun intended. So, am I wrong for refusing to pay for an exterminator?

I love her very much and she makes me feel very special on my birthday, but I only see my parents a few times per year since they moved to the west coast and my uncle and cousin are making their first trip out there at the same time (unrelated to birthday, they’re just going). I wasn’t involved in their plan, but we had discussed going out there with them previously. 

Back in July my cousin bought tickets (I didn’t know he was going to he just bought them, nbd to me I’m adaptable). I told my fiance I was going to go out there with them and invited her to come along. Problem is, she doesn’t have enough PTO to make the trip. Now she is upset that I’m planning on going because the trip happens to be on my birthday. 

I really don’t care about my birthday, I’m turning 26 and it’s just another day to me, but she is arguing that I should not want to spend it anywhere but with her because we are becoming a family. She believes that in a few years if we have children I should want to spend my birthday with our family (which I tend to agree with but we are childless currently) and that’s how it should be now as well. I told her I was totally fine with celebrating on a different day but she’s not having it.

67,1etopw9,AITAH for being a heavy sleeper? ,"*EDIT Thanks everyone for your input, seems I may be the AH so will be trying to work on that! For clarity I'm a woman although i guess thats not super important, and also I don't wake her up unprompted ofc! Only when she has work and needs to get up.*



OK so I'm a really heavy sleeper, like sleeping through a car blowing up in my old neighbourhood heavy.

My partner keeps getting frustrated that I don't wake up when she tries.

In all fairness, part of it is because we'll wake up to my alarm, she'll say something like ""agh 15 more mins"" set an alarm and we'll fall back asleep...but then she doesn't wake me up again, and gets mad that I didn't set another alarm to wake myself up (her alarm doesn't wake me, only my blaring shit).

For context I always set an alarm and get up if there's something important, but on a normal day I kinda expect whoever is up first to wake the other? Like I'll get up and make coffee and wake her up if she sleeps in, but she's just left me sleeping before knowing I have work (we wfh). 

She says it shouldn't be her responsibility which I get but also just don't know why it's such a big deal. She says I use being a heavy sleeper as an excuse but I genuinely do not hear her when she talks to me/tries to wake me up until she does it loudly. 

I need another perspective cause its been a repetive niggle for a while, help me...aitah??

68,1etohdo,"AITA for being rude to a ""helpful"" stranger?","This happened yesterday and it weirdly shook me and I can't stop overthinking it.

My family had just dropped off my grandpa at a dementia care home, my mom stayed with him to get him settled and my little sister and I went to the grocery store to get him an assortment of snacks/necessities. We were in a shopping isle and my sister got really emotional and we were just talking about missing him and hoping he'd be ok, she was getting teary eyed and I guess we were speaking kind of loudly because next thing I know a woman is tapping me on the shoulder and handing me a business card. She said, ""I am a teen counselor, please don't hesitate to give me a call."" I immediately said back, ""well we are both in our 20's so we won't be needing that"" and handed the card back to her.  She looked so taken aback by my comment and just kind of froze next to us. I ushered my sister away and just tried to forget it.

Well, when we were checking out, the woman was in the lane next to us and she was giving me and my sister a noticeable side eye. Then, an older man standing behind us in line leaned over to her and *apologized* for my ""behavior"" because I guess he'd witnessed our interaction. He said he'd ""never get used to how rude the younger generation is"", and then he leaned closer to me and my sister and said ""that woman was just trying to be courteous to you, there was no reason to be so dismissive to a kind stranger"".

I literally had no idea what to say, my sister didn't either. I just turned completely away from him and thankfully was able to use checking out the groceries as an excuse to move on from the interaction. On the way back to my grandpa, my sister and I just kind of laughed at how weird it was but for some reason I can't stop thinking about it. Imo, the woman way overstepped when she offered us her card. She didn't know us or what we were dealing with at all. When my sister and I left the store we could feel the two of them staring at us, it was so uncomfortable and weird.

AITA for being rude? Would you have taken her card?

  
Edit: Thanks everyone for all of the comments and well wishes for my grandpa. I am a chronic overthinker and this situation has just been sitting unpleasantly with me, especially because this last week has been high stress and anxiety. My sister and I are 20 and 22, and it wasn't necessarily the fact that the woman assumed we were teenagers that threw me off I think it was just her very direct approach. My sister started to cry and I put my arm around her and was just talking to her and was really just startled when the woman approached from behind. We were not trying to cause a scene, I had just assumed we were louder than we thought since we had caught her attention. We were in public but I was trying to make it more of a private moment for my sister. I wasn't trying to be rude to her just direct, since she didn't say *anything* else to either of us before or after and I was a bit confused and put off. We were in the store for 10-15 more minutes without seeing her before we went to check out and the woman was at first openly staring at both of us, but when I made eye contact she looked away and continue to look at us both as we moved forward in line, then with the man's comments on top of that I kept thinking wow I must've really missed something about this interaction because I would not have given it another thought if not how they behaved in the line. I didn't look at her card before handing it back so I have no idea where she worked or if she was religiously affiliated or not. The man was genuinely creepy, he got way too close to talk to us and I don't feel bad for not engaging with him, honestly. My family is staying in town through the weekend to be with my grandpa and I am going to try not to think about it anymore.

69,1etoarm,WIBTA if I send my mom’s texts to her family?,"A little background first, my mom and I have had our ups and downs through my life. She has always been a bit of a narcissist and pushes back any time I’ve ever tried to just do my own thing. My older sister is the favorite, the one my mom gets along with much better, and I’m frequently pushed to the side because of it. I don’t talk to my parents or sister often because I just don’t have a lot in common with any of them. But I’ve always tried to make an effort when it comes to birthday wishes and holidays. I’m not great at remembering, but I try.

Last year, my mom was asking my sister and I about Thanksgiving plans and I told her that my husband and I wanted to do our own dinner. She sarcastically said not to worry about it since she was “too much of a burden and no fun to be around”. (The burden comment was because she had surgery, but her oldest sister was going to be handling the dinner plans so it’s not like she was relying on me and my sister to cook.) This has led into a downward spiral where she didn’t bother to let me know about Christmas dinner plans, I had to ask to find out what was happening. She has barely talked to me since then.

One of the last things she said to me was when I accidentally forgot to wish her a happy Mother’s Day. She texted me the next day with a wall of text saying that I was “no longer responsible for being a member of this family”. She also made some comment about not taking it out on my aunts and grandma? I’m not sure what she meant by that, usually my aunt would host a Mother’s Day luncheon at her house, but I didn’t hear that it was happening this year so I didn’t go. I suspect that the luncheon happened and no one bothered to tell me, which would explain the comment, but I still don’t know the truth.

70,1etnw7e,AITA for accidentally offending my coworkers," Long story short, we work at this one clinic where we do xrays, my coworkers are both old ladies in their 60's and have been working here for like 10 years so everyone in this facility basically likes them and will take their side in any arguments. 
I've been working here for over 6 months, my first argument with coworker #1 was after i accidentally said the acronym for the hospital name instead of the full name so after she shouted at me from another room to correct myself, which i did, i went up to her and asked ""oh people dont know the acronym? I thought it was well known"" (Now I'm aware i sound stupid and i was wrong) and she basicallyt shouted that OBVIOUSLY patient didn't know it and asked aggressively ""then i guess im stupid for not knowing it"" which i never implied. 

2nd argument was today with 2nd coworker. For reference she works 5.5 hours and i work 7.5 hours. Today it was only her and I and she ends her shift earlier than me obviously, so when it was 30 minutes left till her shift was over she said ""ok it's your time to work"". We both take turns, one works on the computer and the other takes care of the patient. She most of the time at work talks on the phone loudly, takes like 4 food breaks, is lazy and often mentions it so that comment about how its my turn to work was weird since she barely did any herself. 
But i was used to it so i jokingly said ""u still have 30 mins left"". But apparently it wasn't obvious to her it was a joke because then she gave me a silent treatment and right before she was leaving she told me im lucky shes not the other coworker cause she would yell at me, tell me they both have the high ground here and i should let her know im joking because im again rude and i should watch it. 

I'm a very sensitive and anxious person. If i hurt someone's feelings i think about it for at least some days and cry when I'm alone cause the anxiety gets so strong about it so I'm trying to be nice and not disrespectful. Am i the problem?

I will admit i'm not the brightest person, so i find it easiest when someone just tells me what they want, and i will do my best to get it or something similar for them.

Recently it was my sister's (F18) 18th birthday, which is a very important birthday where i come from. My sister and i haven't had the best relationship growing up,because we had taken different paths in life, and we don't share any common interests. This means that i barely talk to my sister day to day, but i still wanted to get her something nice for her birthday because she's my sister and i still love her.

I think it is important to note that my birthday has only been a month before hers, and when she asked me if i wanted anything i showed her 2 items one that was about £5, and one that was £10. I let her choose which one to get me,and i was pleasantly surprised that she chose the more expensive option, as she also doesn't have a job.

When it came to her birthday, she refused to tell any of her friends or family what she wanted except from our parents, because she wanted a new phone.
the rest of us were left completely in the dark about what she wanted, and it was especially difficult for me to choose something, because as i mentioned before we barley talk anymore. 
I decided to do what she did for me and take her out on a shopping day, to let her pick what she wanted and i would pay. On this day, we went out to the shops and she wouldn't pick ANYTHING. she kept arguing with me about how i was a horrible sister if i couldn't figure out what she wanted, which i think makes no sense because she didn't know what to get me. Then i finally convinced her to pick out something, and when she did she picked out a book that cost around £5. I bought the book and she seemed happy. 

That was until a week or so after her birthday when she started an argument with me about the horrible gift I got her. I was taken aback, and asked her why she picked it out then. She ignored my question and started tearing into me about the price, and how she had spent so much money on my gift, which confused me even more because she could have picked the cheaper option, or picked out something more expensive for herself. she told my parents, who sided with her and said i should have tried harder for my sister, but this is really confusing me so do you think i'm in the wrong?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-16,"AITA for not getting my sister what she wanted for her birthday.

When it came to her birthday, she refused to tell any of her friends or family what she wanted except from our parents, because she wanted a new phone.
the rest of us were left completely in the dark about what she wanted, and it was especially difficult for me to choose something, because as i mentioned before we barley talk anymore. 
I decided to do what she did for me and take her out on a shopping day, to let her pick what she wanted and i would pay. On this day, we went out to the shops and she wouldn't pick ANYTHING. she kept arguing with me about how i was a horrible sister if i couldn't figure out what she wanted, which i think makes no sense because she didn't know what to get me. Then i finally convinced her to pick out something, and when she did she picked out a book that cost around £5. I bought the book and she seemed happy. 

That was until a week or so after her birthday when she started an argument with me about the horrible gift I got her. I was taken aback, and asked her why she picked it out then. She ignored my question and started tearing into me about the price, and how she had spent so much money on my gift, which confused me even more because she could have picked the cheaper option, or picked out something more expensive for herself. she told my parents, who sided with her and said i should have tried harder for my sister, but this is really confusing me so do you think i'm in the wrong?",0.0,0.006718432530760765,0,1
73,1etmphs,AITA for not apologizing to my step sister?,"About four years ago, my partner and I had a pretty tough time, ending with the discovery we couldn’t have kids naturally. Towards the end of this period, I asked my partner to marry me which was an incredible highlight in a very tough period.

About a month later, we went on a week long trip with my dad and step family. On the first evening, my partner and I announced that we were getting married. About a minute later, my stepsister turned towards us and says that she's pregnant. We congratulate her on the news, but I already notice my partner getting flustered. A bit later she walks to the bathroom and my dad’s wife follows to console her. She says her daughter is a bit insensitive and should’ve let us celebrate. The rest of the evening, my partner was quite visibly emotional. Later, we did talk about that we couldn’t blame her for being insensitive about our situation, since nobody knew it yet.

Fast forward to 2024. Everyone now knows we can’t have kids. And we’ve realized that not having kids comes with a ton of freedom, so the sadness is gone.

We visit my dad and that evening his wife mostly ignores us. It turns out she’s unhappy with us because of the tensions between us and the daughter. We weren’t aware of tensions, we just don’t like her much and therefore don’t interact with her a lot. We’re then told that we don’t like her daughter and grand-kid because we can’t have kids ourselves and that we are still angry about four years earlier.

My dad then said that we could’ve gone to my step sister the day after, to explain why we didn’t seem happy after her pregnancy announcement. I said I thought it was a crazy thing to ask, at a point we weren’t even ready to tell any people, let alone her. Then my dad said that we could’ve gone to her a year later to explain what happened the year before (ignoring that due to COVID we hardly even saw each other that year). I told him that we’d already gotten over it and weren’t even aware that this was an issue, so we didn’t even think to do this.

Finally, he asked us to sit down with my step sister and pretty much apologize for making her feel bad. I told him that she never even approached us to ask what was going on. That she also never approached us to tell us she was still feeling bad because of that moment. And finally that I refuse to apologize for being emotional, since people are allowed to be emotional without having to apologize.

I then told my dad and his wife to leave our house and that I would talk to my dad about this some other time. I later told my dad that we will not be joining any family gatherings until all of this stuff has been discussed in a way that makes us feel safe again around them.

74,1etmo41,AITA for demanding friend compensate my lost wallet?,"Hey everyone,

I am on a vacation (camping) with a friend  of mine and just left to get back home. So the story: we already backed up our things and went for the check out to receive our deposit back. Before heading to the train station we needed to go to the toilet. He asked if I still had some toilet paper left, I said I had to look in my bag. While I went searching for it he also went looking in my other bag, that I didn’t really like because it was fully packed. I told him that he should be careful and that he need to check if nothing fell out of my bag. My wallet was in the side pocket with some other things where he went through. Here maybe I am wrong because I should have double checked if everything was there but we also needed to go to the train). 

Couple of hours later we needed to pay for something and I went to grab my wallet out of my bag but it wasn’t there. Of course I immediately went doubting myself if I misplaced it but I know for SURE, that I put it there because we just received our deposit back. At the camp site they can’t find anything so I probably lost it with the amount of 120 euros (130 dollars) in it. 

For me this is a lot of money, I don’t have a lot of money but I can still afford the things I want to do or buy because I live very frugal. Still it is a lot of money for me and that I lost this money made me very emotional because I already spent money on this vacation and I didn’t take this in account. My friend was just standing there. Personally I think he should compensate me for it, as I would myself if I was responsible for this.

 
So will I be an ass if I insist on it that he compensate me for this? 

Edit: just to be clear. I put my wallet away in my backpack behind a zipper. My backpack only went open once when he without asking or my permission went through my backpack.

75,1etlvpf,AITA for calling my husband a liar?,"I (27F) got married to my husband (32M) three years ago. He has a daughter with his ex-wife, Anna (9F). They have a troubled relationship, they go back and forth, blaming and belittling each other. In her defense, the ex-wife does care deeply for Anna, is very kind to me, and both of them make sure Anna never sees or hears them fight. I’m working hard on building a relationship with Anna - I don’t pretend to mother status yet by any means, but we are comfortable with each other, and I do my best to spend quality time with her. We have plenty of family time. My husband and I both work full-time, but we get her ready for school together and take turns picking her up from school. All this to say I spend time with her and have a strong idea of her personality.

Something that has always bothered me about my husband’s relationship with Anna is he exaggerates her intelligence in anecdotes - Anna saying something funny, or interesting, or precocious - the issue is that these are not things she has said, just things my husband thinks would be impressive if she said. She is a smart, kind child, and I do not think we need to be lying about her capabilities. I could tell plenty of true anecdotes of her intelligence that would be true. Recently, I’ve noticed that when Anna overhears these stories, she has begun to look confused. She has protested that she didn’t really say that, but everyone laughs it off. I’ve privately expressed to my husband that I don’t think he should be making up stories about her, but he always acts confused or insists that she did say or do something that just isn’t in keeping with her development.

The ex-wife still attends my husband’s family get-togethers (again, I have no issues with her, she is quite nice to me, she and my husband just get on each other’s nerves often). During this barbecue, my husband began to tell a story about Anna making a funny comment in the Wendy’s drive through the day before. Even setting aside that Anna would not know most of the words that he claims she did, they weren’t at Wendy’s yesterday! I dropped her off, picked her up from school, and cooked and served her dinner before we both put her to bed.I said to my husband that it didn’t happen - at a normal speaking tone, in a group where all the people who heard the anecdote. The ex-wife accused me of suggesting that Anna was stupid, my husband backed her up, and everyone seemed quite miffed at me. I didn’t say anything more, but my husband brought it up once more when we were home. He said I needed to stop calling him a liar, and especially stop giving his ex-wife ammunition to mock him. Which doesn’t even make sense? She was on his side!! I said, you didn’t go to Wendy’s yesterday and he said, yeah, but she could’ve said that!

I think he just wants to present the best version of his daughter to the world, even if it is a false version of who she is. Am I the asshole for calling him a liar, and, I guess, “giving his ex-wife ammunition”?

ETA: Please stop commenting to call my husband abusive. He is not abusive. He is not lying in any other way. Our financials are fine, he is not cheating on me, I know why his ex-wife and him broke up and it is not because he lied.

78,1etl584,AITA for telling my husband he worries too much about his mums boredom and coughs and colds ,"My husband (30M) and I (27F) have been married and living together for a year. We’re both very close with our mums (72F and 61F) His parents don’t speak and  mine our divorced so pretty much raised by our mums single handed. We also have really good relationships with each others mums. 

My mum lives abroad, I moved to the UK when I was 18 and lived and settled here. My husband lived with his mum his whole life till we moved last year, about 10min away. We see his mum every week, sometimes twice a week when we pop over for dinner. My husband often makes comments about he needs to see her more, and feels guilty that she’s bored at home etc. This really hits a sore spot with me as I see my mum twice a year (and it kills me but just our situation) and I think we see his mum plenty, as much as two adults with full time jobs can.  Maybe that’s jealousy though :( 

I also don’t think he’s responsible for her boredom. I think parents our independent adults and we’re all responsible for our own lives. I guess my parents had to come to terms with us moving out a long time ago and have lots of hobbies and play sports.  His mum is older and less active than mine, so I know it’s not quite the same. She’s still totally able and in generally good health (went on a trip to India with her sister recently). But her age weighs on my husband a lot. It’s really sad sensitive thing to acknowledge but i can’t help but think that he makes out that she’s a lot older than she is, and maybe it’s more the guilt of moving out. 

He’s also more of a worrier than I am, especially with illness (any of ours). She had a chest infection two years ago, but recovered well. She had a mild cough recently and my 
husband was extremely worried. I feel like an AH but also said she’s going to get coughs and colds and try not to worry until it’s something to worry about. I recently took him to Taylor swift concert (lifetime swifty, was hugely excited. Edit: I mean less of a swifty but was very keen to come, and I wanted to share the experience with him, and him with me). He was texting his mum for some of the songs and I got a bit upset cause he was a bit of a downer to be with.  He said he was worried about his mum so I felt like an AH. 

My husbands a deeply caring person and it’s something I love about him. Also, I have no resentment for his mum, I love her to bits. This doesn’t come from her expectations. I lived with my grandparents and I know the struggles of old age and watching people you love age. But I genuinely don’t think she’s thaaat old or that unhealthy. 

It came up recently and I tried to gently say that his constant comments about not seeing her enough bother me and that he overly concerned with her being bored since he moved out and with her coughs and colds, he thinks I’m a bit of an AH…

Edit: because I’m getting a lot of shtick for calling him a downer. He wanted to come. When I said less so, I meant less so of a swifty. I paid for both tickets and debated taking my sister instead who actually listens to her music. But my husband and I love doing everything together, and neither of us had gone to a big concert before and he asked to come experience it with me. In the moment I regretted bringing him and yes overreacted. Also it’s not like it was urgent, there were plenty of breaks when he could message and check his phone. He’s someone who’s strict about phones in movies that are important to him, whether his mum has a cough or whatever’s going on. So it felt ironic. It was also off the back of a long conversation about the mum situation so was all a bit raw. And during a really romantic song we listen to, so I wanted to enjoy it with him I guess, so it was very much a ‘are you seriously messaging your mother right now’ feeling. Maybe I’m an AH but I don’t think I’m crazy for feeling some kind of way. Even if it’s not a big deal to him, it was a big deal to me and don’t think asking for him to be present and not be on his phone for a few hours, or even 10 min at a time between sets was a huge ask 

Edit: okay I get it,  I need to have more sympathy for my husband. I genuinely just think I’m the sadly the wrong person for him to share these feelings with because life has shaped me differently. My grandparents were like parents to me, I watched their physical and mental health deteriorate from their 70s to their 90s till they passed. 70 was not and is not old to me, they were fit at 72,  as is his mum. I don’t like calling someone old when they’re not, I feel annoyed on her behalf. I can’t relate deeply to his sadness now because I disagree because she’s very sound mentally and physically, but I know my “she isn’t that old and this isn’t what bad health and old age looks like” attitude doesn’t help him all and AH behaviour. I know it’s his mum and this is the worst he’s seen her, to me she’s actually healthy and it might be the last few years that that’s true. I’m concerned as to how he’ll cope when old age really sets starts to set in. Anyhow, I love her and we’re both prepared to look after our parents/each others when they can’t manage, obviously his sooner than mine. 
Also, I guess mum and I learned came to terms with our independent lives from each other  and adapted a long time ago, whereas this is new territory for him, I get that. Anyway.

In the moment I regretted bringing him and yes overreacted. Also it’s not like it was urgent, there were plenty of breaks when he could message and check his phone. He’s someone who’s strict about phones in movies that are important to him, whether his mum has a cough or whatever’s going on. So it felt ironic. It was also off the back of a long conversation about the mum situation so was all a bit raw. And during a really romantic song we listen to, so I wanted to enjoy it with him I guess, so it was very much a ‘are you seriously messaging your mother right now’ feeling. Maybe I’m an AH but I don’t think I’m crazy for feeling some kind of way. Even if it’s not a big deal to him, it was a big deal to me and don’t think asking for him to be present and not be on his phone for a few hours, or even 10 min at a time between sets was a huge ask 

Edit: okay I get it,  I need to have more sympathy for my husband. I genuinely just think I’m the sadly the wrong person for him to share these feelings with because life has shaped me differently. My grandparents were like parents to me, I watched their physical and mental health deteriorate from their 70s to their 90s till they passed. 70 was not and is not old to me, they were fit at 72,  as is his mum. I don’t like calling someone old when they’re not, I feel annoyed on her behalf. I can’t relate deeply to his sadness now because I disagree because she’s very sound mentally and physically, but I know my “she isn’t that old and this isn’t what bad health and old age looks like” attitude doesn’t help him all and AH behaviour. I know it’s his mum and this is the worst he’s seen her, to me she’s actually healthy and it might be the last few years that that’s true. I’m concerned as to how he’ll cope when old age really sets starts to set in. Anyhow, I love her and we’re both prepared to look after our parents/each others when they can’t manage, obviously his sooner than mine. 
Also, I guess mum and I learned came to terms with our independent lives from each other  and adapted a long time ago, whereas this is new territory for him, I get that. Anyway. I will soften my steely heart. Thanks Reddit ",4.0,1.0664511919021606,1,0
79,1etl47p,AITA for going to the same event I met my ex at?,"Last spring I (M28) started going to a weekly social event in my area, where I met R (M31). I developed feelings for him, and so did he. R has never dated men before and wanted to figure it out for himself, so we avoided the topic for a while, staying friends.

This April we decided to try dating. For a while, things have been going well! Until the beginning of July. R broke up with me right after my birthday when we were supposed to meet for dinner and a gift exchange. It was tense but civil and I haven't spoken or interacted with R in any way since.

For a while, I avoided the social group where we met too. Last week my friend N wanted to come there, so I thought, to hell with it, it's a public space, different people join all the time and it has been more than a month. I made peace with the breakup and the group is big enough for us not to talk at all. R didn't go and we had a great time.

This week R came to the group. N joined as well, and for the whole evening we all kept to our respective corners, not talking. After the event was over, N and I paid for our drinks and headed home. R aggressively caught up to us a block away from the cafe and threw a tantrum. He screamed at me something like ""if you wanted my reaction, here it is, I fucking hate you now"" and started slowly storming off, pausing for my response.

I tried de-escalating and calmly talking things through, because I felt too ambushed to argue, plus we were in the middle of the street, but he was still being quite aggressive. In the end, after scoffing and flailing at my every word, he admitted he was extremely angry at me for coming and didn't want to see me at all. I offered to split the group and switch the weeks we're coming around, to make sure we're not bumping into each other, but he retaliated with ""I don't feel like sharing, this group is mine"". I reminded R that the group is public, we both equally like it and have met cool people there, so we both deserve this space. He screamed at me again for not giving him or the organizers a heads up (not required), I apologized, because I didn't know he would be coming at all. Plus, after the breakup he clearly asked not to text him. At this point, the conversation was going nowhere, so I disengaged, wished him a nice evening and went home.

In the end, after talking to N and other friends, I do see R's point, but the scale of the tantrum is still confusing (our breakup was very civil).

So, here's why I think I might be an asshole: I should have warned R that I will be coming, but it genuinely slipped my mind. Or I should have not come to the group at all and avoided it for another couple of months. Or reached out to him to agree whether coming to the event would be okay at some point. I didn't do any of that. But I also thought we are adults who could keep face in public and the group is big.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-16,"AITA for going to the same event I met my ex at?

80,1etkooh,AITA for refusing to bring my ex's other children along on days out with our two sons?,"I (32M) have two sons ""Jamie"" (11M) and ""Jayden"" (10M). Their mother and I were high school sweethearts who had the boys before we finished college. We had planned to get married but then I found out my ex was cheating on me and I broke up with her. Jayden was 14 months old at the time. We split custody and I paid child support for the first 18 months post breakup, until my ex was earning similarly to me which meant child support was ceased and costs were simply split with nobody giving anyone ""extra"".

My ex had another son two years after we broke up. The father was not in the picture. She told me he was the guy she cheated on me with and that she realized he was a POS, etc, and asked if I would consider adopting her son and raising him as my own alongside our boys. I told her I wasn't going to do that. We ended up arguing about this for so long that she had time to get into another relationship and move this man in, so I told her that he should be a father figure to her son since they plan on building a life together. Within a year that guy was gone and she had a daughter he fathered.

I continued being a dad to my sons only. I didn't interact with her other two children but I would see them from a distance during exchanges. She asked me to adopt both her additional children stating they needed a father. I told her to go and find their fathers then.

She eased up when she met her husband. I thought maybe it was finally the end of her trying to make me responsible for her other children. She has a child with her husband now too, so five in total in her household when our boys are included. But it has not lasted. My ex has admitted her husband isn't involved in the lives of her other children and they are still missing out on having a father. So she asked me to include her three other children, and that does include the child she has with her husband, in days out I have with my sons. She said especially during summer and around Christmas when I take them to do fun holiday themed activities, it's not something she can give her other children and she wants them to experience these things also.

She finds out when I do these things with my boys because she will quiz them about their time with me. And each time she gets angry. But when the boys were with her two weeks ago she got extra pissed. She had mentioned to me that her son (the oldest of her other three kids) didn't get much for his birthday and she had wanted to make it up to him. That was meant to mean me. So when she heard our boys and I had visited an amusement park around his birthday, she blew a fuse and asked me how I can be such an asshole to children. She told me I should be doing better as a father.

82,1etjvan,AITA for following my niece and leaving my brothers house after she unloaded on my brother and SIL?,"This is something that happened only a few days ago. My niece Ciara (24f) had a baby two and a half weeks ago. She and her partner decided they didn't want anyone at the hospital and would handle visits when things settled a bit. Her dad and stepmom offered to host any family on her paternal side she wanted to have meet the baby and she agreed and I was invited. During the visit my brother was holding Ciara's baby and he told SIL, who is step-grandma, that their first grandchild looks just like her and that Ciara's child was a mini-SIL. Ciara told her dad not to say that. He told her it was true and should be proud. SIL asked her why that offends her so much, after all she is grandma and these things can happen. Ciara said she's step. She's a stepmom, a step-grandma. She is not biologically related to her or her child and both of them need to accept that and stop trying to force this idea that they (Ciara, her child but also Ciara's full siblings) look like SIL.

My brother told her to calm down and stop acting hormonal and like there's something wrong with finding familiar features in family. Ciara took her baby off my brother and passed the baby to her partner. Then she told them SIL is not her real family, is not her real mom, is not who she looks like. She told them she has always looked just like her mom and so does her baby. She told them she had warned them they were going to stop acting like SIL was her actual mom and the actual grandma or she would walk. And she did. She told them she was done.

I followed Ciara out which angered my brother and SIL. I soothed Ciara and reassured her that we haven't all forgotten her mom. Once I got home I realized the anger my brother and SIL held toward me for leaving too because I had several texts. They told me I had defended Ciara being unreasonably nasty to them and especially to SIL and I should have stayed to support them instead of Ciara.

For those who'll ask for background. My brother was widowed young, Ciara was the oldest at 7, her siblings were 4 and 2. My brother remarried 18 months after his first wife died. He'd known SIL six months at the time. It was very fast for Ciara but the marriage also started because my brother wanted the kids to have a mom, which is something Ciara never liked and she has never cared for SIL but learned to tolerate her over time. But my brother and SIL do like to talk as though SIL birthed the three original kids which I mentioned before wasn't right because their mom still deserved to be recognized. I was ignored however. And to clarify what I mean by that. SIL and my brother will say the kids look just like SIL when all three favor their mom heavily, or they'll claim ""they"" have saved for the kids since birth, they also describe Ciara as their first born child. Comments of that nature are very common from them.

84,1etjhue,AITA for telling my friend my feelings?,"
I’m completely lost and unsure of how to proceed. Recently, I was told that in order to see my niece, I must also spend solo time with her step-sister. I raised my niece for the first ten years of her life, as she lived with me during that time. My half-sister, her mother, has been in and out of rehab, and we no longer speak. My only option to see my niece is through her father, who has since married and adopted his wife’s 7-year-old daughter.

The first year after my niece’s father remarried was great. I was able to reconnect with my niece, whom I love as my own child. I got to know her stepmother and her step-sister, and while my niece and I continued our solo adventures as we always had, I also spent some time with the entire family. I’ve even developed a friendship with her stepmother.

However, due to a series of surgeries, I couldn’t visit for a year and a half. Despite this, I felt confident that my relationship with my niece remained strong, as I always felt welcomed. Now that I’m slowly recovering, we were planning to resume our solo outings, but the stepmother approached me with a request: since her daughter has become attached to me and sees me as her aunt, she asked that I spend solo time with her as well.

This left me confused because I’ve only spent a handful of group outings with her daughter. The stepmother argued that since her daughter now sees me as “Aunt Jax,” it wouldn’t be fair to exclude her, as it could hurt her feelings. I’ve always made sure her daughter felt seen and valued during our group time, providing equal attention and gifts to both girls. I never corrected her daughter for calling me “Aunt Jax” because it’s what my niece calls me.

When I expressed to the stepmother that I care for her daughter but see her as my friend’s child rather than my niece, things became tense. She was clearly hurt, and our conversation turned uncomfortable. She insisted that because I’m seen as “Aunt Jax” to her daughter, I need to take on the roles and responsibilities of that title. I tried to explain that my primary focus is my relationship with my niece, whom I’ve loved and cared for as my own child. While I’m not against developing a bond with her daughter, I feel this relationship should grow naturally over time, not be forced upon us.

Unfortunately, they’ve made it clear that spending solo time with their daughter is now a condition for me to see my niece. This has raised several red flags for me, especially since the stepmother questioned when I would “make the time” if I truly wanted to foster a relationship. I’m upset and hurt that I’m being asked to fulfill their expectations without them considering my feelings. It’s concerning that my time with my niece, which has always been special to us, is now being controlled rather than respected.

86,1etis74,"AITA for getting married in Australia, where I live?","I’m a 25 y/o from Germany, and my fiancé (28) is Australian. I moved to Sydney over six years ago, but we make a point to visit my family in Germany at least every 1 1/2 years. Last December, we flew back for the holidays, my birthday, and, as it turned out, for my fiancé to propose to me in my hometown, so my family could share in the moment. Everyone was over the moon for us!



We decided to have our wedding in Sydney, as none of my family, except my mum, has ever visited us here, so we saw it as a great opportunity for them to get a glimpse of our life, meet our friends, and explore Australia. My main concerns were my dad and one of my sisters, both of whom struggle financially, and my sister Jessie (27), has mental health issues that make big gatherings difficult for her.

When we announced that the wedding would be in Sydney, most of the family was keen, but my stepmother immediately brought up their financial issues and the need to cancel other holidays for it. Jessie seemed excited and planned to use the trip to visit New Zealand as well with her boyfriend to see Hobbiton (we're all big nerds).

We chose October 2025 for the wedding to give everyone nearly two years to prepare and to fit around my younger siblings' school schedules - the venue is booked, so the plans are set.

However, things got complicated when I had a falling out with my dad over inviting my aunt (his sister), whom he despises on and off. He initially said he wouldn’t come if she was invited. After my mum intervened, he promised he’d make it to the wedding, saying the thought of missing it was too painful. 

Recently, Jessie sent me a long message saying she understands why my dad is struggling with the wedding and complained about the expense and the effort it takes to get there, which confused me because she was initially so positive about it all, and he had already promised he'd be there.

I told her I’m not forcing anyone to come but really want my dad there, as I’ve never asked him for anything else and I need him. I tried to move on, but the situation has been eating at me ever since. 

This week I found a cheap hotel deal for October next year and shared it with my eldest sister Laura (29), suggesting they book it and cancel if plans change (free of charge). The next morning, I woke up to a voicemail from Jessie, furious and yelling she is not going to attend. Apparently Laura had shared the link with her asking if they should book it, and that's when Jessie disclosed that her bf is turning 30 in December and wants to go on holiday to Asia, which now takes priority over my wedding. Needless to say, things got ugly between them.

I get it if Jessie can’t come due to finances or her mental health but wish she’d at least show some interest and support. It’s been really rough planning the wedding with this hanging over me, and part of me is just wants to elope to avoid the stress it's causing for everyone.

88,1etiljw,AITA for lashing out on my stay-at-home husband for spending our household budget on my SIL whom I despise ,"I(33F) am the sole breadwinner to my family, husband (41M) and daughter (2F). My income is divided to 1/3 for our mortgage, 1/3 for our household daily expenses, the rest to our daughter's education + vacation + emergency savings. Our household daily expenses is managed by my husband which includes food, baby items, utilities etc. And I told him he is free to use the remains of every month. My daughter is starting school from September and I had made a request to have a contribution from the household budget for her lunch money. My husband became defensive and refused to contribute. He explained that we do not have enough from the household budget. I got annoyed and lashed out on his spendings on alcohol, which I can see a few empty bottles per week, and also his spendings for my SIL who I absolutely despise. I know I told him he is free to spend any remainings of the household budget as he pleases, but refusing to contribute to our daughter's school lunch money is tipping me off. AITA?

Edit: I love my husband very much. I always try to think of the other way around, if he is the sole breadwinner and I am the stay at home mom, but this time I do not have the right answer.

Yes, he might have a drinking problem, but we make sure he only drinks when our toddler is sleeping at night. I do not know the right amount of consumption as I do not drink. He blames the extra expenses on electrical appliances (ie humidifier, blender) which were not clearly defined in the scope of our budget. 

For those who are wondering, SIL (44F) is perfectly healthy, single and very close to my husband. She never bothers to take the hint that her lifestyle wanting to involve my husband in all the ""fun stuff"" is affecting us. She requests sharing of online subscriptions (to me is a non-necessity). And my husband buys and sends her gifts from our trips.

Edit2: Thank you redditers especially those who advised to sit down and have a financial conversation. We did and we had a very civilised conversation (not so much here in this thread, unfortunately) Long story short, we came into terms that he will partly contribute to the lunch money while another part will come out from the other 1/3 (education, savings etc).

To some of the popular questions: 
1. My assuming and vague answer to the drinking problem is the major problem here? Anyways, we have vodka bottles and beer cans here. Not so much beer in bottles, from where we are.
2. I do not have any reserved fun money for myself to maximise the amount in the savings. I do not smoke or do my nails, there is a free coffee vending machines at my workplace, videos from amazon prime, reddit on my phone. Occasionally, we eat out as a family with the other 1/3 savings. Not sure if it would put me as financially abusing my husband in this situation though. You're the judge, not me.
3. Some kindly asked how we can have monthly trips if we're tight on budget. I would really like to ask, do you have kids?

89,1eti6ah,AITA for refusing to drive home because of driving anxiety?,"Background: I (21F) have been sort of learning to drive over the last year. I haven’t done any formal lessons, just driving around with my dad sometimes. I really hate driving, I get super anxious over it and sometimes second guess my ability. My parents get annoyed with this. I think from their perspective, my anxiety is baseless and I should just do it anyway because practicing is how you improve. I don’t disagree with practicing, but I think I shouldn’t drive if I don’t feel confident enough. I’m autistic and often get overwhelmed making decisions, if that matters. I’m not good at being decisive and I’m not good at paying attention to a lot happening at once, both of which are important for driving. 

Yesterday, my dad and I needed to go to the grocery store, so I suggested I could drive us there. I haven’t driven in a few weeks so I thought it would be good practice. I started out by driving over the curb while backing out of the driveway, thinking the brake was the gas pedal and worrying I broke the car, and then I didn't see a car coming because of the sun in my eyes (my dad saw it and I hit the breaks in time). We got there alright, but when it came to drive home, I realized I had to turn out of a parking lot onto a busy street and then either change lanes immediately or turn immediately. It was sunset and rush hour, generally not great conditions, and the last time I turned out of a parking lot, someone almost hit me or I almost hit someone, I don’t remember exactly but either way it was scary and I didn’t want to repeat that. 

So I wasn't at all confident about this, and I was trying to figure out the easiest way to get home. My dad told me to just go out this exit, that’s the easiest way, but I was still really afraid I was gonna fuck up and so I said I think he should just drive us home instead of me. He was really frustrated at this point because I was hesitating for so long and he refused. We argued: he was trying to convince me to just drive and I was trying to convince him to drive, and eventually he said “if you’re not gonna drive home, then you’re walking home.” I said fine, (we’re a mile away, it’s not that far) and he said fine and I got out of the car and walked home. 

I don’t think him driving us home instead of me is a big deal and I think he shouldn’t have yelled at me and shouldn’t have kicked me out of the car. However, I can see why he got upset: he just wanted to get home and trying to get me to “just drive” when I’m afraid to is like pulling teeth.

90,1eti4zw,AITAH for telling my coworker 'talk to me only when needed',"I started a new job about a month ago and I've been dealing with some passive-aggressive behavior from a couple of my coworkers.

One time, I was struggling to open a door and they told me to eat more and make some strength. Another time, I overheard them calling me ""yapper."" I've also noticed they have this weird habit of staring at me and giggling when I'm talking to someone else. It's really uncomfortable.

Yesterday, I was supposed to join them for the carpool (arranged by the office. No one pays anything for it) but got stuck in traffic. We have a group chat where everyone confirms if they're coming, so I initially said I would be there but got stuck in traffic. I couldn't update them because of service by issues. When they got to work, they started grilling me about why I didn't update them, even though I explained it was a network issue. Until my work buddy came to rescue and said ""We only waited two extra minutes, it's no big deal.""
Today, my manager was talking about some work stuff with these same people and they started saying things like, ""Oh, Mel can totally help with this, she's worked on international marketing campaigns."" Then they looked at me and said, ""Right, Mel?"" I could sense the sarcasm in their tone. I ignored them a couple of times but they kept pushing, so finally, I said, ""Talk to me when it's necessary, otherwise, please don't.""
Now I feel like a total jerk. I know it's petty, but I'm just so tired of their crap. AITA for snapping at them?

92,1ethpo5,AITA for listening in on my parents private conversation? ,"So, my family has cameras set up around our property for security reasons but also to catch cool wildlife that passes by. I scroll through the videos every now and then to see what kind of animals pop up in our yard and I always see the cutest stuff! A bunch of deer grazing on the food we leave out for them, a mama raccoon and her four new babies, etc. It’s a fun thing to see as a huge animal lover. 

Well anyway, I was catching up on the videos because I haven’t checked them in over a week and as I’m scrolling, I hear my name. I stop to see what’s going on and my parents are sitting down by one of the cameras having a conversation. I know I shouldn’t have kept listening, but I heard my name so I was intrigued. 

I then hear my mom say “she drains me” and she talks about how I’ll want to join her on walks after dinner and she’s like “here we go 🙄”. They then are talking about me dating and having a partner someday and my dad says he “pities the fool”and that “he’s signing up for something like what my dad signed up for- high maintenance!” and then lists off some of my mental health struggles saying his mom didn’t have those problems though. So yeah... thanks dad! 

What’s crazy too is I don’t even know what was all said because the videos kept cutting off and then starting again at different points in the conversation so they could’ve said even worse things for all I know. But they both want me to move out so they can “move on with their lives” and I’m working on it, I just haven’t been in a hurry to because to my face they tell me they love having me at home. So I’m confused. And hurt. I thought we were having fun and enjoying each other’s company, but now I’m not sure what to think. 

I know I’m not perfect and sometimes when I’m stressed that rubs off on them apparently, but am I really that bad? I mean dang! They’re my parents! They should love me unconditionally and not tear me down or weaponize my mental health. That makes me sad 😔 

I told them what I heard and their response was anger that I “spied on them” and listened to their “private conversation”. I told them I didn’t mean to but when I heard my name I couldn’t look away. And they were also sitting right in front of the security cameras lol so what kind of “private conversation” is that? AITA?

EDIT: I’m seeing a lot of comments asking how old I am. I’m 25. I never wanted to live at home with my parents at 25, but I graduated college during covid and with that came a lot of unexpected changes to my life plans. Everything I had been planning for years got cancelled and so I was lost and didn’t know what to do. I moved home for what I thought was going to be a “gap year”. Time flew by and I was slowly but surely figuring things out for myself, but now all of a sudden I’m 25. I’ve been planning to move out this fall to a bigger city, but it’s been extremely hard to find a good full time job that will support me enough financially to live on my own. I make my own money now, working part time, but it’s not a lot. My mental health has definitely held me back as well. I’ve been stressed, overwhelmed, and unsure about the future. I know everything will end up working out in the end, but I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel yet. I want to move out and move on with my life, but I’ve also gotten really comfortable being back home where things are familiar to me. I didn’t live at home when I was in college so being able to be back and spend time with my family and pets in my childhood home has been nice. I know I’ll look back on this time and be grateful for it. It is time to move on though. Hopefully I’ll land a great job soon, find a place to live in a new city that feels homey, and make some new friends.

So, my family has cameras set up around our property for security reasons but also to catch cool wildlife that passes by.

A bunch of deer grazing on the food we leave out for them, a mama raccoon and her four new babies, etc. It’s a fun thing to see as a huge animal lover.

93,1eth78v,AITA I (M25) got into an argument with my gf (22) because she called her ex,"Tonight, I had an argument with my girlfriend of one year after she called her ex-boyfriend to apologize for something that happened over a year ago.

When we first met last summer, we had a rough start because she joked about infidelity. She believed it was harmless, expecting me to trust she’d never actually cheat. We argued but eventually moved on, and she promised to stop making those jokes. 

Later, we argued about her allowing men who were interested in her to keep contacting her without directly telling them she wasn’t interested. After multiple arguments, she promised to stop, but she didn’t follow through.

She kept in touch with an ex-boyfriend, claiming she had no feelings for him and that he knew how serious our relationship was. I could tell he was still interested, but I decided not to seem insecure and let it go. One day, while we were cuddling in the kitchen, her ex called. She looked at her phone but didn’t answer. I noticed the caller ID and walked away to the living room. She let the phone ring and continued doing things in the kitchen, which is in the same area.

She came over and asked why I wasn’t talking and why I had walked away. I told her I felt uncomfortable and asked why she didn’t pick up the phone when she answers all her other calls in front of me, just as I do with her. I questioned why, if she’s okay with texting him and talking sometimes, she couldn’t pick up the phone.

She said there was no issue, that they don’t talk often, and that I shouldn’t be insecure. I told her I was going to leave, but she started crying and begging me to stay. I said, “Okay, if everything is as you say, call him.” So she did.

They talked casually for a bit, and I whispered for her to ask if he knew she was in a relationship. She hesitated but eventually asked. Her ex said he wasn’t aware of any relationship. She started to panic and asked him several times, but he insisted she hadn’t made it clear. I tried to leave, but she cut the call and begged me to stay, insisting she wasn’t playing games. I asked her to call him back, and I had an amicable conversation with him. He assured me there was no issue, that he didn’t want to come between us, and agreed to block her. After the call, she blocked him and deleted his number.

That happened a year ago. Today, she called me to say she had contacted her ex to apologize for her actions. She said she’d always wanted to apologize because she didn’t want to be someone who hurts others. She didn’t tell me beforehand because she thought I’d find it weird. During her explanation, she changed her story a few times, which made me suspicious. I told her that while wanting to apologize was valid, not telling me beforehand made it hard to trust her. It felt sketchy and dishonest. We argued, and now we’re not talking. Am I the asshole?

94,1eth188,AITA fo telling a guy everything thats wrong with him?,"

I’m using a throwaway account to share this. I recently got into a disagreement with a guy I used to talk to. His main argument was that I’m ‘broke’ and that nobody would want me because I’m Black and don’t have as much money as he does. It’s ironic because my parents are actually well-off, and I’m doing quite well for my age. I typically attract people in a positive way. 

Throughout our conversation, I kept asking him if he was genuinely happy with himself and his life, but he kept dodging the question. Now, I’m wondering if I was wrong for calling him out. maybe it wasn’t that serious. I feel like I might have been too rude, or maybe I should’ve just avoided engaging with him. Normally, I’m not an angry person, and I was never really rude to him before. 

When we used to hang out, if I didn’t want to kiss him or do anything physical, he would always say things like, “You don’t like me?” and try to make me feel bad. but he would constantly try and bail on me without telling abt it but would constantly make me feel bad everytime i said no (which was most of the time a no after he bailed on me 2 times w/o ever letting me know and went to a concert last minute without telling anything) the reason i was talking to him was because, he was really nice at the start until i realized that i shouldnt rlly be around him for my sake. he always tried to brag to me about all his expensive shit while we were talking and barely anything else important which is one of the reasons the argument started. he never cared about my time so thats why i left him alone. hes also done something else that im not comfortable with sharing on here so when he msged me again i js told him he was a asshole. During our argument, he started spamming me with pictures of his cars and clothes, which I didn’t think was relevant. On top of that, he was throwing racial slurs at me and asking questions like, “Do you have a boat? Do you have this? Do you have that?” while bragging about what he owns, his parents’ wealth, and even his weed collection. He even tried to claim he makes more than my dad (which he doesn’t). 

He used to always ask me to come see him and complimented my looks, so it’s pretty embarrassing that all he could fall back on was saying I’m broke and Black. I didn’t get a chance to take more screenshots of the conversation because it all happened in the heat of the moment. I was screen-sharing it with my friend on FaceTime before he unadded me, so now I can’t get them back (I’ll post what I do have in the next post).

97,1etgb69,AITA for telling my sister I’m getting the same material glasses as her?,"I’ve had glasses for as long as I can remember. When I was younger my older sister would bully me for them so I would hide them in my backpack once I got to school but eventually my mom found out and had my teacher search my bag everyday. So I started hiding them around the house and even broke them on a few occasions. I hated them but once i reached fourth grade I started wearing them. 

I stopped when I reached high school and have been trying to get back in the habit of wearing them since then. In the past couple of years I’ve tried multiple frames and I just hate them. Recently, though, I’ve been getting headaches when I don’t wear them but I just cringe whenever I see my own reflection. 

Now to my younger sister. She got glasses a few years after I did she went through a few styles before settling on her recent frames. The day that she picked them out, we were both looking for a new glasses and I recommended she get clear frames and in return she picked out a pair of metal frames for me. I ended up hating those glasses more than any other that I’ve had while she loved hers.

I’ve tried every style but clear even though I’ve always liked them. I think that if I had a pair with clear frames I’d be more likely to wear them because right now I have to just deal with the blurriness and headaches or wear glasses that make me avoid looking at myself altogether. 

The only reason I haven’t gotten them yet is because I brought this up with her as a courtesy, thinking that she wouldn’t mind but she got really upset and said that it was her ‘signature’ and that I’d be fucked up if I got those.

I kind of get where she’s coming from but also I’ve never had a problem with sharing things so I can’t fully understand how she feels.

98,1etfqso,AITA for explaining to my brother how game audio works?,"So to start things off, we’re a muslim family and I’m an 18 year old boy who loves gaming and playing around, while my brother, 24, is more stoic (At least tries to) and more grumpy, he’s the type of guy where you can’t have a conversation with unless it doesn’t involve him or his problems, especially with someone like me, which I personally feel like he tolerates the least, but anyways so there I was in my room playing on my switch (play splatoon 3 that games fun af) and my brother comes in asking me to set up the Wii, (we’ve had it for a long time but he recently got back playing on it.) 

So the game starts, (We were playing Nicktoons Globs of Doom)  and while playing the characters voices were REALLY loud, so I paused the game to turn the voices down, my bro asked what I was doing, and I said “Turning down the volume.” And his response was, “Just turn it down from the TV.” I explained that it’s the voices specially that I’m turning down and while doing so he got annoyed saying I’m turning it down too much (I tuned it from 10 to like 4, but you need to understand that those grunt sounds they make in game are LOUD.)

 so I stopped and he once again said we could just turn down the T.V and I once again explained that the point of the audio settings was for tuning specific sounds. So we got back playing with him being visibly annoyed so I tried making funny remarks like “You're about to die.” And stuff like that, only for his response to be a grumpy “I don’t care.”

 I don’t even know what happened after but guess I made a remark on the audio settings which got him pissed as he started raising his voice saying “Can you stop talking about that?!” I then tried calming him down telling him he doesn’t need to get worked up over it and idk why but I started jokingly saying “shhhhh” which made him even more mad as he threw the controller across the room storming out saying “You're so annoying!” He repeated while going downstairs. 

My mom who heard then told me I was in the wrong and I should stop bullying him (remember the age difference here) and my bro then for some reason asked me if I even prayed Isha yet, which I guess it’s because I sometimes pray a little late so he tried getting at me, though I did so that’s what I said, he kept making a big deal out of it the whole time, which at that point, I kinda just found it amusing because my mom was so into what he had to say while refusing to hear me out, only for him to finish saying, “I don’t even want to keep fighting, I don’t want to make this a big deal.” And went to his room all calm and composed and proceeded to listen to the Quran, so now I’m sitting in my room still trying to process all this cuz I did keep bringing up the audio, but did he have to blow up like that?

",Everyone Sucks,2024-08-16,"AITA for explaining to my brother how game audio works? So to start things off, we’re a muslim family and I’m an 18 year old boy who loves gaming and playing around, while my brother, 24, is more stoic (At least tries to) and more grumpy, he’s the type of guy where you can’t have a conversation with unless it doesn’t involve him or his problems, especially with someone like me, which I personally feel like he tolerates the least, but anyways so there I was in my room playing on my switch (play splatoon 3 that games fun af) and my brother comes in asking me to set up the Wii, (we’ve had it for a long time but he recently got back playing on it.) 

So the game starts, (We were playing Nicktoons Globs of Doom)  and while playing the characters voices were REALLY loud, so I paused the game to turn the voices down, my bro asked what I was doing, and I said “Turning down the volume.” And his response was, “Just turn it down from the TV.” I explained that it’s the voices specially that I’m turning down and while doing so he got annoyed saying I’m turning it down too much (I tuned it from 10 to like 4, but you need to understand that those grunt sounds they make in game are LOUD.)

 so I stopped and he once again said we could just turn down the T.V and I once again explained that the point of the audio settings was for tuning specific sounds. So we got back playing with him being visibly annoyed so I tried making funny remarks like “You're about to die.” And stuff like that, only for his response to be a grumpy “I don’t care.”

 I don’t even know what happened after but guess I made a remark on the audio settings which got him pissed as he started raising his voice saying “Can you stop talking about that?!” I then tried calming him down telling him he doesn’t need to get worked up over it and idk why but I started jokingly saying “shhhhh” which made him even more mad as he threw the controller across the room storming out saying “You're so annoying!” He repeated while going downstairs.

I have 3 older brothers who are all moved out. My original plan for life was to join a trade and just hangout, however my father made me work with him at his shop. He runs a body shop for cars and works alone. I am happy to help him but he makes it so miserable. He doesn’t speak to me about anything and doesn’t teach me anything. He expects me to know everything and decides to get mad when I don’t. After 2 months of this i’ve decided that i want out as fast as possible, and want to move to college; so I did exactly that. I start college Thursday, and wanted to spend the summer with my friends before we all go our separate ways. My parents however, hated this idea. I’d work usually 6-8 hours at the shop and ask to hangout with friends after. Sometimes hitting up a lake, or other times just going to the gym. It’s a simple life i wanted to live so bad, but today was the final straw. My friend is leaving for basic training in the military, and i won’t have any contact with him till December. We went to the gym then hung out at his house after. I was supposed to be home at 8:30, however i got home at 9:30. I argued with my parents about it and they called me a disappointment. I apologized to my parents and they didn’t even acknowledge me. It isn’t like we drink or smoke or anything. We just like to hang out and do random stuff, like swim or play pool or ping pong.

100,1etewmp,AITAH For Asking My Husband To Get Our Daughter Milk?,"Some background information: 

My husband commutes two days a week. Usually, he wakes up at 5:30am in the mornings on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and gets home anywhere from 5:00-6:00pm. His commute is 4 hours round trip. There have been a few times where he has gotten home at 7:00pm. The rest of the week he is up anywhere from 8:00am-10:00am and works until 5:00pm. 

I'm a stay at home mom, and more often than not I will get up around 5:30am as well (on Tuesdays and Thursdays), pack him lunch, and begin doing things around the house. The rest of the week/weekend, I get up with my daughter around 6:30am-7:30am depending on when she wakes up. I tend to watch her the majority of the week/weekend. Every night, my husband will do my daughter's bedtime routine.

We have hired my mom to help us (the equivalent of 15-20 hours a week). She generally takes me to appointments, grocery shopping, and to toddler activities as I don't drive. She also helps watch my daughter while I clean the house, if we have date nights, etc. 

It was agreed upon that I wouldn't ask him to do any household stuff on the days he commutes. Fair. On days he doesn't commute, and after our daughter is asleep, we split the chores I haven't gotten to yet (mainly picking up the living room/cleaning the cat box/dishes from dinner/taking the trash out). 

On to today's event: 

My daughter finished her bottle, and wanted a little bit more milk before bed. I was sitting with her in a chair and my husband was across from me sitting on the couch. I asked him if he could get her some more milk, as I didn't want to move her from my lap. I had just got her settled down from being upset. 

He immediately complained and said, ""why does it always have to be me?"" He got up, pissed, did what I had asked, and then sat back down. 

I asked him about his reaction afterward. He said I agreed to not ask him for any ""extras"" on the days he commutes and that he is tired on the days he goes in. I said, ""I understand you are tired. I am tired, too. I don't get much down time. However, I don't think I am asking you for much by asking you to fill up her bottle...I agreed to no extra housework, not you not helping me with your daughter."" 

Things got heated, he told me my mom needs to be fired if I am tired since she is not doing her job. He told me I am asking too much of him, said that he was allowed to be annoyed with me for asking, and called me controlling. At one point I was like, ""Are you a parent?"" Trying to break down what I was trying to get across. Then, he started going off on how my question was ""retarded"", etc.

We were joining my family a day late because I'm a massage therapist and have a client with a long session and didn't want to turn down the money, so I can't carpool with parents. 

B f and I share the car, thing is he only has a learners permit and not a license yet so he can't take car by himself (due to a negative experience as a child in the car he had severe anxiety about driving and has just gotten to a place where he feels ready); not much sufficient public transit where we live and an Uber/left from our apartment to his work would be super expensive. 

One of his colleagues needed to take off at short notice not sure why (this would be halfway into our vacation); someone else can cover all but one of her shifts and my bf said he ""felt bad"" and volunteered for it, but this would mean I have to drive all the way back home in the middle of our vacation and take him to work just for one shift and then we go back. 

He agreed to this without asking me first knowing the transportation situation; I told him since he agreed to this he can stay home while i go on vacation with my family to cover this shift,  and these are the consequences of his choices without asking me first when he depended on me for a ride, and he'll be responsible for his own ride there.

Recently, our TV in the living room and basement broke due to an issue with I’m assuming our Amazon Firestick. So we went to my bedroom. I left the door open for my parents mind sake since they are traditional Asian parents. We watched YouTube and listened to music. She laid on my bed and I sat in my gaming chair. Eventually, I sat on the bed just to get my butt comfy. All this and the door remained open. Eventually, my mom walks past my room to do the laundry. I say hello and my girlfriend does as well. She ignores me. Twice. So I get up to check if everything is ok with her. She looks at me and whispers “I don’t want her in there. Get her out and go downstairs”. Before I could explain the TV situation. She closes her bedroom door on me. I tell my girlfriend about the situation and my girlfriend says she’ll go home because she doesn’t want to cause anymore trouble. She offers to apologize to my mom. We walk out of the room and I knock her door. She exclaims “What??” And I ask her to open the door. She ignores me again and my girlfriend and I stand there not knowing what to do.

She texted me an apology but I don’t think she has to apologize at all. She asked me to tell my mom that she’s sorry. 

AITA in this situation?

UPDATE: I just talked to my mom and she started off by being fairly aggressive. But when I talked to her calmly, she said that she doesn’t like that she’s over a lot. I told her simply because they complained about how much I go see her. Rent isn’t really feasible right now since both of my jobs are lower paying and school is really taking a lot out of my budget. I have been trying to save more and more each paycheque but unfortunately, an emergency expense always seems to pop up. There is also this mentality that may not be for all Asian families but it is reoccurring in mine. The “we took care of you when you were young. So take care of us when we’re old” mentality. Apparently, rule goes further than what I thought. I was now told that I am not allowed to go on any vacations with her or travel anywhere with her because we aren’t married. I have stayed at her place before and I’ve always told them my plans in doing so. But every time I do, they don’t really speak to me for a day or 3 afterwards. After asking why, she did say “it’s our culture”. 

Another thing I wanted to add is that I have a younger brother who these rules haven’t really applied to. He has had friends of both genders in his room on separate occasions. A photo of him is also my mother’s lockscreen on her phone. Not a family photo. Not a photo of the two of us. A photo of him from approx a year ago so there’s that.

Started studying criminal justice but decided to pursue my dreams of going to music school. After that, I went back to school as a backup. I say this because it is brought up a lot by both parents.

Family pictures are coming up soon for my Great-Grandmothers 80th Birthday, we want to commemorate this with pictures and my Mother has booked professional photographs for this. The dress code is formal, i've bought one daughter a sparkly purple dress she is like a little magpie anything sparkly and she is all over it, my other daughter i've bought a green dress with flowers on it as she loves flowers. I plan to do one daughters hair in pigtails and the other will have a hairband.

She offered to buy them new matching dresses but I refused. She told me I was being ridiculous and it was only one picture and wouldn't kill them, when I asked if she'd bought my brothers daughters who are 11 and 7 matching dresses she said no, why would she do that which led to me asking her why my children should dress alike then which of course the answer was them being identical twins. 

This led to a rather heated conversation and I told my Mother that they are my daughters and it's my call, all she needs to be concerned about is them being presentable and matching the dress code. She told me I am being selfish here and it won't matter, pointing out how lots of twins like to dress alike. I told her that if they wished to dress alike one day i'd not stop them but till then this is what I was doing.

My brother has since called me and asked me to just do it, that our Mother is stressed out and how I can change the girls out of it after the picture and that it's only a picture and it'd keep the peace.

She told me I am being selfish here and it won't matter, pointing out how lots of twins like to dress alike. I told her that if they wished to dress alike one day i'd not stop them but till then this is what I was doing.

My brother has since called me and asked me to just do it, that our Mother is stressed out and how I can change the girls out of it after the picture and that it's only a picture and it'd keep the peace. I know it's only a picture but it just sits wrong with me, is it really assholeish of me to not bend on this?",0.0,0.4837522506713867,0,1

Throwaway account

I moved into my city 7 ish months ago with my two children (“Ava” 6f and “Joe” 3m) and to make new friends for both me and my children I joined a few mom groups. One of them has weekly “meetup” events like park play dates or things just for adults all in good fun. It’s usually a good turn out especially the park days. 

I went to a park play date yesterday and a good amount of moms showed with their children as well. Ava and Joe were mingling around but they like to stick together and share toys. A little boy around 5-6 was running around and played with my kids for a bit. I’ll just call him Kid. 

I (and a lot of other moms) brought toys from home to share. Ava shared her doll with Kid while they were playing. Kid went up to his mom (I’ll just call her Mom) who I recognized from a few other meetups. She was sitting on a bench on the phone and when Kid showed her, she yelled at him to give it back. When he wouldn’t, Mom grabbed it from him and came over to me to give it back. 

I thought it was a miscommunication so I tried to let her know that it was ok for him to play with and Ava wanted to share. She just said “no” and walked back to her seat. 

Mom then started speaking loudly about how little boys don’t play with dolls and started listing appropriate toys. I assume whoever she was on the phone with started to say something but she got louder about how she’s the mother and what she says goes. 

She was right so I minded my business. Kid looked clean, healthy, and loved, so there was no reason for me to get involved. Until she kept going on and on and getting louder about the situation. A few parents overheard her and looked but what finally bothered me was Joe got sad and wouldn’t play with Ava anymore. 

I asked why and he (in toddler speak) said because he’s a boy. I let him know he can play with whatever and whoever he wants as long as he asks first and sent him and Ava to the swings. 

I went to mom and asked her if she could have her conversation a bit quieter because it’s affecting how others are playing. She went off about how she’ll raise her son how she wants. I tried saying I’m not coming for her parenting but I don’t want her views to affect my children and I’m not trying to push my views on her or anyone there just keep it cute for the literal children trying to have fun. 

She ended up leaving and no one said anything to me in person but I saw a post in the mom group about how at meetups everyone needs to be respectful of others beliefs and if problems continue to occur members will be banned from the group and/or asked not to attend meetups. 

Now I feel like I should have just ignored it. I genuinely wasn’t trying to start anything just asked her not to be so loud. My friends are split so AITA",Not the A-hole,2024-08-16,"AITA for asking a mom to have her phone conversation quieter at the park?

Long story short, our relationship became very strained when i got my first job in toward the tail end of high school. Understandably she wanted me to help pay bills and groceries; it was just the two of us so i didn't mind. However what I wasn't aware of for a long time is that she was using my money to purchase drugs and alcohol when she said it was for bills. Not cool. As you might imagine, this led to lots of arguments and yelling. She threatened to kick me out multiple times (again i was still in high school). I figured something had to change. I wasn't making enough to live on my own, not bright enough to go away to college, so i enlisted. Father isn't in the picture since i turned 18 because they divorced shortly after I was born (i spent weekends with him when i was younger). Their relationship is still very much sour, but ours is great (I have no idea why they split).

At no point during my upbringing did my mom have a job or any sort of income other than from government programs such at section 8 and food stamps. This led to us getting evicted 3 times before I was 16. The first time I was walking home from school in elementary school during a snow storm. I see all of our stuff in the street and my mom in tears (I had no idea what was going on) and as a result we were homeless for a couple days.

I lost contact with my mom during that year and had no idea how she was doing or if she was even alive. I have no idea why she refused to be employed. I asked one time when I was 9 and she whooped me (never asked again).

I have online classes Tuesday and Thursday from 9-10:30am on Zoom and Monday, Wednesday and Friday, I have psychology work hours over at my college shadowing my counselor for work hours.

 Anyway, my wife (23) and I had decided to do an early dinner for a movie night yesterday as I got off “work” early. My wife “Lizzie” was babysitting her 2 nephews (age 4 years old and age 6 months) for my SIL (25f) “Maggie”. Maggie came by to pick up the kids AFTER we had made a simple and quick dinner (literally chicken nuggets, waffle cut fries and string beans)  as we had kids and it was easier that way, plus the wife and I love a simple dinner like this. Maggie was complaining about her work day and how tired she was and that she didn’t have the energy to cook the kids dinner and I had stated that they were already fed. Maggie ended up asking what we had made and Lizzie responded with our dinner. Maggie asked if we had leftovers (I ALWAYS make more for our lunches or dinner the next day anyway) and I replied that we did. Maggie asked if she could have some and I responded “no” and explained my reasoning why. We ended up getting it after Maggie whined and complained of tired she was from work (She’s a dog walker and had two clients today who had 2 dogs each).

I suffered financially for it but my parents never helped, blaming me for a low starting wage. I felt like they didn’t give a shit about me when I decided to do a degree they didn’t approve of. 

My bf is half Chinese and he thinks what my parents did was practical because my parents would have been stuck paying for a degree that doesn’t improve my income.

Because of how close we are, I feel guilty even writing this, but I can't ignore how frustrated and angry I’ve been feeling lately. The thing is, despite how much I care for her and how deeply I love her, I often find myself getting really upset by her behavior.

She’s one of those people who always seems to have something negative to say, no matter the situation. It feels like she has this need to one-up everyone around her, especially me.

For instance, when I’m genuinely happy and things are going well in my life, instead of being happy for me, she’ll start talking about how she’s also doing amazingly well, often emphasizing how her experiences are even better than mine. When I’m struggling, she shifts the focus to her own problems, making them seem worse. She also reacts poorly when I feel good about myself, often complimenting herself and pointing out my flaws.

I’ve gone through so much and I mean SO much to get to this point in my life. I’ve worked incredibly hard to achieve the success I have today. I’m somewhat a celebrity because of my talents but I’ve NEVER gotten congrats. She doesn’t like when I win, when I’m happy, when I’m sad. She ALWAYS has to have it worse or better than me and that hurts more than I can put into words. 

I keep getting extremely angry with her and end up snapping, not because of what she's saying but because her constant need for validation is deeply frustrating.

It’s not that I’m blowing her off, I’m just not being as present with her plus not inviting her to things I'm going to.

113,1etc0er,WIBTA for potentially taking another teacher’s position?,"Edit: Thank you guys for making me feel like not an asshole. This whole situation was a bit weird but I am so so happy! :) I’ve been wanting my own classroom for literal years but life hasn’t been the easiest. I get to do what I love and teach talented students!  Have a good weekend, y’all 💕




Would I be the asshole if I potentially take another person’s teacher position?

I am currently a long-term substitute teacher in my dream junior high classroom. Not only is it in the subject I have a degree in…. The kids love me, administration loves me, teachers like me, it’s a 8 minute drive from my house, and I LOVE the campus. 

The reason I’m a long term sub is because the teacher I’m covering is currently out of the state for whatever reason. I have an indefinite end date because they’re not sure when they’re coming! Since then, the principal has asked me to stay and replace the person who is supposed to be the permanent teacher once they come back. 

I am OVERJOYED with this possibility because this is exactly what I want to do with my life! The campus has such a great atmosphere, I love the community, and the kids are 90% amazing!

I get to do what I love and teach talented students!  Have a good weekend, y’all 💕




Would I be the asshole if I potentially take another person’s teacher position?

I am currently a long-term substitute teacher in my dream junior high classroom. Not only is it in the subject I have a degree in…. The kids love me, administration loves me, teachers like me, it’s a 8 minute drive from my house, and I LOVE the campus. 

The reason I’m a long term sub is because the teacher I’m covering is currently out of the state for whatever reason. I have an indefinite end date because they’re not sure when they’re coming! Since then, the principal has asked me to stay and replace the person who is supposed to be the permanent teacher once they come back. 

I am OVERJOYED with this possibility because this is exactly what I want to do with my life! The campus has such a great atmosphere, I love the community, and the kids are 90% amazing! I also have more in-classroom experience than the incoming teacher (who hasn’t worked in a classroom before, even as a substitute.)

So to start off, he gets cranky when hes tired. bf worked all afternoon/evening and didnt make it home til 3am.

We stayed up til 4am until she had finally settled enough to sleep. She woke back up at 9am and I fed and changed her and put her back to sleep, and I got up to put bfs clothes in the wash so he has work clothes for today. Ive been up since, I am very tired. Baby woke back up around 11:30 and was fine up until about 12:00 when she started fussing again. I checked everything to make sure she was okay, changed, not hungry, etc. Her crying woke my bf up and he asks what's wrong, I said I think she's still tired. He asks if I've checked her and everything and I said yeah. He didnt hear me between her crying and our air conditioner and said ""what?"" Louder. I repeated myself Louder as I speak softly, but he didn't hear me again, so this time he yelled it at me. I froze and stared at him and told him not to yell at me. He started yelling at me again that I'm whispering and he can't hear me. I got up with my daughter and walked out of the room and began crying. Once I settled and came back he looked annoyed and asked why I was crying (his tone sounded annoyed as well) and I told him I don't like being yelled at (he knows I was in an abusive marriage years ago) and he said he doesn't like me whispering. When I said I wasn't whispering, he said ""well then I guess I wasn't yelling"" and got up and left. Our day just started and it's gone to shit. But I'm left wondering if IATA for being softly spoken and getting upset over it?

Have to add as well he yelled so loud my roommate came in after he left and she asked if I was okay because she heard it, and her room is down the hall..

115,1etb8el,AITA for refusing to play a game with my friends if they don't consider what I want as well?,"CONTEXT: I and 2 of my friends play B03 Zombies (A video game) together.

116,1etb3a4,AITA for intentionally leaving my younger sister at school?,"i (17f) just started my senior year of high school. my sister (14f) started her freshman year at the same school, and since i have my license, i drive her to and from school pretty much every day. my sister and i aren't close since we're very, very different people. having to drive her has been miserable. shes usually a few minutes late getting into the car in the morning. once we get to school, she complains about having to walk alone to the main building and doesnt want to get out of my car because she wants to wait for her friends. getting home after school is grating. she either takes forever to get to my car (up to 20 minutes late), or gets there before me and spam texts/calls me to hurry up.

today, my friends and i were hanging out and chatting for a bit longer than usual after school, and i expected a bunch of texts telling me to get to my car, but didn't get any, so i assumed she was getting picked up by someone else and had already left. but when my friends and i started walking to the senior parking lot where i was parked, i passed her and a few of her freshman friends in the hallway going the opposite direction of the senior lot. i said something along the lines of ""hey, come to senior, we're leaving now."" she responds with ""do i look like im going to senior?"" in a bitchy voice. i genuinely thought i'd misheard her and got confused, so i asked if i was supposed to be driving her home. she said ""are you driving me? are we in a car right now?"" in the same voice. she wasn't joking. all her friends were giggling when she walked away and ignored me when i was like hey what?? because i was so taken aback by how fucking rude she was for no reason. my friends who were with me were equally shocked. i was so pissed off, between that and a cumulation of the smaller stuff from the past two weeks, that i just got in my car and left her at school. i was halfway home when she texted me, not apologizing or saying she had another ride home. she fucking asked me if i could move my car to the front of the school to pick her up because she didn't want to walk all the way to the senior lot. 

i didn't feel bad anymore once i read that and ignored her call when she realized i had left. once i got home, i told my mom what had happened and she immediately called my sister and chewed her out before going to pick her up. my school is only about a mile away from my house, but traffic backs up so badly after schools let out that it can take more than 20 minutes for me to get home, so my mom was really annoyed that she had to get her. my parents said they'd talk to her and ""set expectations"" for her.

so, am i the asshole? i understand that she's in the weird young teen phase and probably gets annoyed at me having to drive her too, but i feel like she's been unreasonably rude for the past few weeks and the incident today really, really pissed me off.

117,1etanrg,AITA if I tell my mom she can’t live with us?,"
I have a history with my mom. She’s been extremely kind and effusive, but we have also had a touch and go relationship. 

She tends to be easily upset, extremely sensitive, and can’t seem to let issues go when we disagree. We will talk in circles with her refusing to acknowledge my pov but also refusing to move on.

She’s very traumatized, she has no savings, she has no job, she has no retirement fund. She has absolutely nothing. She has been living with sketchy dudes for years because it’s all she can afford.

In the past, after bad disagreements, I’ve had to block her and tell my employers about her because she can become extremely vindictive (as an example, when I was in high school, she got upset when I got my ACT scores back and scored highly. She said I was going to “leave her” for some “college far away” and then threw me out of the house. She then told all my teachers I had run away and not to give me any extensions)

It’s been like this for years. It’s hard for me to completely cut her out but she’s historically been pretty awful.

We started talking at the recommendation of my sister and I found out my mom has been doing a lot of therapy. She was doing EMDR and felt it had really helped her calm down and change how she reacts. 

I was suspicious but figured I’d keep talking to her. She seemed better and happier. We continued talking and started to toy with the idea of her living with me and my husband for a little bit to help get her out of the sketchy living situation she is currently in. My husband was open to the idea. We were coming up with a plan for her to visit for a bit then we would decide after that. My biggest things were I wanted her to have a goal for what she’d do after living with us for a winter, I wanted her to work part time in town and save up some money (I live in a really small town).  I also wanted a contract in place for her stay to protect myself and my husband.

I have been a bit worried about the possibility of having her out here because of her historical volatility. This is a place where everyone talks and I think she may try to slander me if things went sideways. 

Nevertheless, I’ve been trying to give her grace and a chance to redeem herself because I believe people can change if they want to. 

But yesterday, she completely spiraled while talking to me.  telling me how much she wants to d*e and how my sister and I are the only reason she sticks around and how it’s out of a sense of duty.

I am concerned. I encouraged her to talk about this with her therapist, to which she said she’s just accepted it (?) and she just wants to get somewhere cool (another country) before it happens. 

I have no idea what to make of this conversation. It did not leave me feeling good about this situation.

I am still open to her visiting - but I don’t know if I should trust her or not 

She  apologized today, said that was out of character for her and she’s been dealing with bad insomnia.
