0,1etnmg6,AITA for trying to get my younger brother on HRT without his parents' consent?,"My (M23) younger brother, Liam (FTM16) is transgender, he's always been certain that he's a lad, not a girl. When our kid was younger, 12 like, I'd find him getting ready to go out in my clothes and he'd reject anything for lasses, he'd never let anyone call him a girl, his birth name or she/her.

Liam ended up with a foster family when he was 13. Only thing I can say for them is that they're middle class so they're getting our kid the stuff he wouldn't have with me on the road constantly and earning nowt much. They don't get him at all, they think it's some sort of phase, they have an idea of the family they want and they're trying their best to get it; that includes Liam being a lass and limiting his contact with people he knew before they had him. They don't call my lad male pronouns, they 'compromise' with using they/them, they buy him clothes from both sections.

Last time he came over to my place after school, our kid was moaning about it all. He's a pretty lad, passes, taller than me lmao, but he's upset because he's not in a body he feels comfortable with and his foster parents, Jane (F45) and Graham (M48) are reluctant if not at all against the idea of him being on blockers or hrt.

I love the lad more than owt, I'm gonna do anything for him, so i'm trying to get Liam on HRT. It's a pain in the arse and spenny as hell, Liam's trying to convince me to DIY it with him. My partner, Johnny (M28) brought up recently that its an asshole move to pull the rug out from under his parents feet like that, and that there's only 2 years left until our kid is on his own so perhaps its not worth it if its going to totally wreck his relationship with Jane and Graham.",POO Mode Activated ðŸ’©,2024-08-16,"AITA for trying to get my younger brother on HRT without his parents' consent?

1,1etgtem,UPDATE: AITA for making my partners drinking water too warm?,"UPDATE: AITA for making my partners drinking water too warm?

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vjclfg/aita_for_making_my_partners_drinking_water_too/)

So 2 years on, I thought I'd make an update to the original debacle that confused everyone and polarised the community. There was so many comments, some incredibly empathetic and helpful, some racist and mean but generally I don't believe there was ever a consensus reached. Despite all that, I was incredibly grateful to all the comments received from everyone. Whilst I didn't take the time to reply, I actually did read through them all.

On to the update...

So as some people pointed out, our argument was not really about the water. Generally in every relationship, every person just wants to feel seen, heard, important, understood, and loved. My actions that day did not make her feel that way, and in of itself was more indicative of a longer running issue between us in our relationship.

For a bit of background, we both have (had) childhood trauma and the beginning of our relationship was quite volatile. Defying the odds we stayed together and got married, however marriage doesn't solve those issues.

Over the last 2 years, we've continued to stay together - Yes - We are still married (much to the chagrin of those who were advocating our divorce \*side eye\*) and continued to grow together.

Believe it or not the incident involving the water was a bit of a catalyst to us having better conversations regarding how we are going to resolve our own trauma and improve our communication.

Long story short, she got therapy, I got therapy, we did some marriage counselling, she got more therapy, I got more therapy and it's been a journey, but a worthwhile one.

When two people really do love each other, and want to work it out, they'll find a way to. I'm so genuinely grateful for my wife, who she was, who she is now, the strength she has and the belief she had in us, and more so in me.

Our communication is better than it's ever been, our intimacy is stronger than it's ever been and we are at such an amazing place. The future looks incredibly bright.

It took a lot of work to get here, and there's a lot more work left to be done, but we have each other's backs and we'll keep going together.

Thank you again Reddit and whilst this update might not be what some of you were hoping for, it's where we are at now!

TL;DR - Worked on ourselves, got therapy and counselling, worked through underlying issues individually, and as a couple, improved our communication by leaps and bounds, we are now closer, stronger and better than ever before!",UPDATE,2024-08-16,"UPDATE: AITA for making my partners drinking water too warm?
