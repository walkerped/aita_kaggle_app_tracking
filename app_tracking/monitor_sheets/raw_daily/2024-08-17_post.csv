With that being said, i have gotten rather close with his family. i've gone out with his siblings, we've drank and played games together, normal stuff. btw he has 3 other siblings (m19,f20,m18). the relationship my boyfriend has with his siblings is a very obvious sibling relationship. the talk rudely to each other, they fight and argue, sibling stuff. but last night it feels as if i'm being treated like i'm their sibling...but im not. I had brought a game over for all of us to play. my bf and i were watching a movie when we heard them all having fun downstairs and wanted to join in. i jokingly went down there and said ""that's f***ed up"" because they were playing without us. it was purely a joke, i honestly didn't care and just wanted to play with all of them like i intended. what came out of my bfs brothers mouths was just beyond me. they started randomly attacking me and making fun of me for being very sensitive and for crying a lot. his brother (19m) was the first to say something about me crying. i can't remember what exactly he said at first bc i was kinda in shock from just being randomly shitted on. his other brother (18m) said ""yea i get up to go to the bathroom at 1am and all i hear is him mocking my cry "" the other one goes(19m) "" stop you're going to make her cry again""... everyone who was downstairs was laughing at me. i don't think ive ever been hurt by something like that in a while. i'm also just genuinely going though a lot. i've just recently found out i was pregnant. i'm struggling with the fact that im not keeping it. my hormones are also all over the place as my body is not completely mine atm. ive also not been able to tell anyone what im going through except for my boyfriend. having my feelings mocked and thrown at my face like that just put me in such a low spot. my boyfriend did say something to his brother but that doesn't make me feel good. i honestly want to stop coming over here. i don't want to associate myself with them anymore. i've been nothing but nice and respectful to everyone in this house and the fact that i was just randomly made fun of for something i literally just can't control rn ?? it sucks. and it may not seem like a big deal but my feelings were genuinely hurt. i don't care to have a relationship with them anyway. i don't need people like that in my life... so AITA",Asshole,2024-08-17,"AITA -bfs family/siblings I (21f) have been dating my boyfriend (21m) for over a year. we've taken a break but all in all it's been a year plus.

1,1euv4yr,AITA for refusing to give my parent's my address when I move out?,"I 17M will be moving out next year once I'm done with high school, I will most likely finish closing on a duplex by 06 of 2025. I am financially blessed to be able to support myself, my income is steady I am wonderful at managing my monthly expenses and saving no issues on that.

I like my family, their on both ends of the spectrum, while growing up my dad was a piece of shit sometimes but also helped me out in ways I wouldn't be where I am without him, it just sucks that his impulsive actions and child like behavior in his 20% of the time ruins the good man he is the other 80%. I'm moving out because I genuinely cannot stand living with my family. I am literally nocturnal just to avoid them.

Like I said I'd fight tooth and nail for my family but I hate living with them, we just dont share many ideas and lifestyles.

I also don't share religions with my parents but Im yet to tell them, the entirety of my family is muslim but if I told them I wasn't muslim theyd be upset for a long time but eventually get over it while trying to get me to revert.

My parents are aware I plan to move out and while talking about it my wonderful older sister decides to chime her big ass head in ""Well when you move out your letting mom and dad like sleep over and visit and stuff right"" I said no, I used the excuse that the house would be my ""new office"" and I don't want people in and out of my office.

My parents went on a rant of how they always knew I'd abandon them and throw them away once I finished using them. I've adapted to the mentality that if I treat them like mentally ill children throwing temper tantrums it usually works out ok. For the next 2 hours they were arguing with my about how I can't just leave and how I wont be around as often and I said I obviously wouldn't and I let them know that when Im gone Ill see them less and less often.

Btw: My dad is currently in his ""silent treatment"" stage for my decision.

My family's values and mine simply dont align, they want me to get married, I dont. They want me to go to college, I dont. They want me to live at home till I'm 25, I dont. They want me to get a normal 9-5 job, I dont.

By the way, I want a dog when Im out, I'm thinking about adopting but I'd prefer a dog that doesn't shed so that when they eventually do visit when Im 23 or something they won't know I have a dog. Any recommendations on breeds? Peace!

Here are my options:

3,1euuf8u,"AITA for giving a silly, arbitrary award to a teenage girl?","I (19M) was working at a camp some time back when I got into a row with the staff over something stupid, and it led to a bunch of other bs.

Essentially, at the end of each session, the camp had an award ceremony. It wasn't super formal but campers and staff alike could give awards to each other over various things like performance in an activity or even something more silly and less concrete. I didn't even know about this ceremony before it happened, but regardless, I hadn't had any plans to give awards to anyone.

However, there was this one group of teenage boys at the camp that I had a strange dynamic with. They would diss me frequently but would still go out of their way to talk to me and engage. After giving me a somewhat back-handed award, two of them came up to me and begged me to give them an award for being my favorite campers. I wasn't sure at first if I should since they were jerks a lot, but I'm pretty nice so I thought why not. But I decided that if I was going to go up, I wasn't going to give awards to just them.

There was one camper (11-13F) I'd gotten to know who was much friendlier than other campers and greeted me by name whenever she saw me. I debated whether I should give the award thinking it might look strange to give it to a girl, but I decided I shouldn't be meek and that it'd be fine (you'll soon see I greatly overestimated the maturity of the people there; the older campers and staff were like literal children in how they spread rumors and latched onto stupid shit).

I decided to give her her award in between both of the boys, and I said a few words about how she was cool before calling her up for a single handshake.

Well wouldn't you know it, the next day a manager pulls up and asks to talk. He tells me that it didn't go unnoticed that I gave an award to a young female camper (as if I didn't do that in front of an entire crowd), and that I didn't know her well enough to do that. At this point, I'm certain I'd made her uncomfortable and she'd complained, so I decide to not engage with her again. However, at lunch she comes up to me on her own and asks me in a normal friendly tone when I'm going to give her her physical award. I realize she hadn't had any issue with it and that it had purely been the staff. I decide that since she asked I might as well give the award.

Later I ask one of her counselors a detail of her name so I could properly address it on the award. She says she doesn't know but later that night her and her co-counselors are giving me death stares and the same manager pulls me away from another ceremony and kinda prompts me to explain myself. I told him what I explained above, after which point he becomes less hostile and says I can just pass the award on to one of her counselors rather than her directly.

This started at least a year ago when I bought him the game on the PS4, where he would start getting merchandise of this said character;for example, pins, stickers, t-shirts, etc. He talks about the character non-stop sometimes, giving an analysis about the character, and if anyone says something about it, he will continue with his tangent even more. My husband and I have found it incredibly annoying, but we've stayed silent because we don't want to shut him down or hurt his feelings. He got a costume of him and has wore it in public, despite me going against the idea of him wearing it on casual occasions that aren't like Halloween or a party, but he still does anyway. He even started mimicking some his personality traits.

I didn't mind as much when it was small things like this, but the more time does by the morning his behavior starts to go more extreme. He’s constantly copies Kokichi's script lines in conversations, which makes it hard for us to have a normal dialogue without him breaking out in some annoying annoying voiceline of his. Overtime room is covered in posters related to the character, and he has had his phone case, and lock screen and homescreen as this character.

Trust me when I say I tried to be patient, but I really couldn't when he began mimicking Kokichi's more problematic traits, like being extremely manipulative and disrespectful. When I confronted him about this and expressed that it was negatively affecting his behavior and our family dynamic, I ended up taking out all of my stress that I bottled up over the time and I ended up yelling. I told him that he needs to stop idolizing a character who promotes such negative traits and start focusing more on his real life and relationships instead of being stuck in this delusional phase of his. 

He was really hurt by my reaction and ended up shutting down and gone back to his room. Now it's been 2 days since that conversation  and now it feels like I attacked something he genuinely loves and finds comforting.

I told some of my loved ones about this. My sister and husband thinks I overreacted and should have approached the situation more calmly, while my dad and sister's husband believe I was right to address the issue before it escalated further.

So here’s the problem, each time she complains about the issues that I already know about, it kinda make me feel like shit, because i feel like its because of me thats she’s suffering 

Few days ago we went to check out an apartment, we agreed before we go that we will not move in we just wanna check it out and see in future if we wanna move in here or not, so we went there and she was trying to convince me that we can actually move in right now, and i did my math which it wasn’t very logical to move in right now since i haven’t gotten my raise yet 

This caused a fight between us which we both got very hurt to be honest

Then later we made peace again and she asked me if I regret marrying her, which ofc i said no because i do love her very very much

Then she asked if i regret marrying her early, i said i don’t regret marrying you early but i wish we could have waited a year maximum so we could have afforded somewhere better, she got very upset with this comment, i explained to her many times that i do love her very much and i dont regret marrying her, its just to have a better house so we could avoid all this fights and problems

14,1eurv95,AITA for considering making the person who takes care of my house homeless?,"I (25F) have been married to my husband, Johnny (M26) for five years; together we have a daughter, Lyla (5F). Though we married and settled down relatively young, we've managed to build a decent life together. Recently, Johnny's friend, Steven (M27) moved in with us.

Steven has always been a fixture in Johnny's life, they've known each other since they were teens and have a bond that goes beyond typical friendship. He's this intense, brooding type who's never really found his place in the world. He talks a lot about how traditional life isn't for him, and how he thinks most people are just fooling themselves with their comfortable little lives. He's also a devout vegetarian and constantly talks about how unethical it is to eat meat. That's fine-Johnny and I are vegetarians too, but Steven takes it to the extreme.
 
Recently he went through a tough financial situation, but ever since Steven moved in, things have been changed.

He's started to take over many of my responsibilities at home. I work long hours to support our family, so I'm not around as much as I'd like to be. Steven has stepped in to cook and look after Lyla. He often makes comments like, ""You're so lucky to have a break; most people don't get a chance to escape their mundane lives,"" which feels like a dig at my role as a homemaker.

He spends a lot of time with Lyla,he's usually gentle with her,but the things he says or reads to her trouble me, they're cynical. Things like ""be careful who you trust,"" or ""all the world's a stage and everyone's an actor"" He's helping to teach her piano and she hangs onto his every word, even copying his mannerisms. Johnny spends a lot of time with him, they have animated conversations and sit around playing guitar when Johnny comes home from work. It feels like Steven's taking away time from my family to spend with me.

I've tried talking to Johnny but he brushes it off. He's started making comments like, ""Steven's been a rock for us during this tough time,""Johnny seems to think Steven's presence is necessary and beneficial for our family.

The situation came to a head when Steven told Lyla, ""Some people will disappoint you, even those who seem nice."" When I confronted him, he acted like he was trying to prepare her for the ""real world."" I told him he needed to step back or he'd need to find somewhere else to stay. Steven went straight to Johnny, who accused me of being unfair.

Johnny's reaction was more extreme than I anticipated. He said that if Steven had to leave, he might end up homeless, and that it was a harsh thing to do, considering his situation.

I'm going back down next week, and I've been staying with my mom, my aunt, & my aunt's bf

I'm a fragile person as both of my shoulders have slipped out from doing the least in the past
Along with that, I've never traveled alone before. Coming up here was the first time & I have to go back down alone, but they all have things they want me to carry back. There's nothing wrong with that. It's just stuff like clothes and whatnot. But here's the part that has me stressing. My mom and her sister's bf both have devices they want to send back down to people. I should probably tell you from now that my mother is going down in October of this same year, which isn't far away and she is way more used to flying and dealing with the airport than me.

Here's the deal, my mom bought a new laptop and phone for her employee back home to use, another phone for a family member who asked, & my aunt's bf is also sending 2 phones & a laptop.

My aunt's bf just spoke to me saying that I'm gonna have to learn these things at some point, and I know that. But personally, if it were me, I wouldn't want to do that to anyone. Not so many things. If I were an adult, I would still try to avoid this at all cost because the airport can be very stressful and hard to deal with at times. So I wouldn't pack anything much like how many devices they want me to come back down with.

Idk, I'm just feeling rlly stressed abt this and don't know if I'm just being a baby, or if I'm valid for not wanting to carry down so many things. The devices are the problem as I know I'm going to get withheld at security (the anything to declare part) for it or however they deal with that, I don't know. Everything else is fine because they're just clothes and whatnot that I would be fine going through security with otherwise. And keep in mind that my mother will be going down in October, and it seems these things (except maybe the work thing) are not anything urgent. And if they have to reconsider it and not send me down with them, it'll also make me feel bad and as if I shouldn't have felt the way I did and that I was behaving spoiled. When I came up, I knew I would be coming back down with clothes for family members and stuff, but not this much, especially the devices that I'm definitely not getting past security with because they'll probably assume it's for commercial use or whatever reason. Like I said, I've never dealt with this before. If I ever experience it, I'd rather it be the security's fault than me for packing things I knew I wouldn't get through easily with. If any of this airport talk sounds silly, please correct me as like I said I've never dealt with airport in any other way than having to rearrange an overweight suitcase.

21,1euqttn,AITA for calling my BFF a “Lazy Parent” ,"So me and my best friend (both F 24) have been bffs since we were 10. & We got so lucky to have our own little girls so close in age.. or so I thought. 
let’s call my bff Stacy 

Stacy’s daughter is 16 months older than my daughter and there’s a huge difference in how we parent. I try not to be judgmental, but when it starts to affect MY kid, I can’t help it.  
For example, My daughter is 14 months old and has little to no screentime. Occasionally she’ll watch an episode of something low-stim but that just started about 2 months ago. Stacy’s daughter however, has had an ipad in her face playing coco melon & mickey mouse since she was 4 months old (I wish I was kidding). But, whatever, that’s her parenting choice. My issue is, why does she need it while she’s supposed to be having a playdate with my daughter? Or why does she need it while we’re at the park? or in a store? or at a restaurant? or at the aquarium?? 

The other day we were at a restaurant and the babies were next to each other in high chairs. Stacy’s daughter had a phone playing a show loudly and naturally my daughter was intrigued. but Stacy’s daughter got angry when my daughter started grabbing at the phone and she hit my baby right in the face. I took the phone away and said “well we don’t need this right now anyway” and Stacy’s daughter started having a FIT. Her solution to that was to give her the phone right back, and she also didn’t correct her behavior at all after she slapped my baby in the face. 

I let it go and a few days later (yesterday) we were playing at her house. My daughter was playing with a toy while Stacy’s daughter was watching a show on her ipad. Suddenly she walks over to my daughter and yanks the toy from her and pushes her down and my daughter hits her head. Stacy did absolutely nothing but say “i guess she wanted her toy” no correction of behavior. No teaching her to apologize. I did call her out for this and she said “She’s just a baby she doesn’t know any better” to which i replied “and who do you think is supposed to teach her better” and then she just ignored me so I grabbed my daughter and our stuff and said “I’m leaving because I can’t deal with the lazy parenting anymore” and I left. 

There has been many other similar situations to these two that always end with my daughter getting hurt and i’m just not feeling the play dates anymore. Even though my daughter is only 1, I always correct her behavior when she does  something unsafe, esp to another child. So, AITA?

I asked her when I could have a back seat and she angrily under her breath shouted ""no! you will NEVER get one."" I was mortified.

She then had the audacity to call my mom into an 'emergency meeting' with the school psychologist and guidance counselor because she thought I was 'disturbed' and that there was something wrong with me mental health wise (all because I mentioned I don't get along with my stepdad at home, but that's a story for a different time...).

He fell asleep on my fabric sofa in my family room, and slept there all night.  We rarely use that sofa.  

The next evening, I kept smelling a urine smell and could not figure out where it was coming from.  I opened my windows to try and air out the house and scrubbed the toilet in our guest bathroom off the hall from the family room. That didn't help. I was embarrassed thinking my dog had peed somewhere and kept trying to find the source, to no avail.

That night we went to dinner and my nephew got into my car with my daughter and me. My husband, my MIL, and my SIL traveled in a separate car. The minute my nephew closed the door of my car the urine smell wafted through the car. I asked my daughter (also autistc) if she smelled it, thinking I was losing my mind. She confirmed it was coming from my nephew.  

I didn't say anything because he is easily angered. I just cracked the windows and spoke with his mom later to suggest he may need to change his clothes.

A few days after they left, I still smelled it and realized he had peed on my sofa. My dogs cannot get on that sofa because it's too high up, so I know it was him. It could only have been my nephew.  We used our little shop vacuum thing to steam it three times with the Bissell pet stain remover stuff you can buy at Home Depot. It still smelled. We drowned in Febreze, that masked the smell for a day or two, but it comes back.

25,1euq1qk,AITA or just pathetic ,"
Sorry this is going to be kinda long and I’m on mobile. I 24f am currently caring and living with my grandma who was recently diagnosed with alzheimer's. My parents and sister live nearby but don’t help a whole lot because my parents are usually busy with work. So I’m under a lot of stress helping my grandma. 

Every now and then and then I babysit, My sister started babysitting for them when I first moved away from home for college and now that I’m back she’s still the first one they contact to babysit so if I’m babysitting for them it’s because she’s already said she couldn’t. 

I’ve got the classic oldest daughter syndrome in case it wasn’t obvious before, so when my family asks for help I’m always there, even at the cost of my own mental health. I’ve picked up a lot of work for my sister and I think she’s only filled in for me twice. 

I was scheduled to babysit today but it had been a rough week mentally and somehow I strained my neck a couple days prior. I also got a wicked sunburn the day. I then called my sister to ask if she could fill in for me this time instead because I was tired and in pain. I knew she had gone to the beach earlier but had nothing going on during the time I needed her to fill in for. 

When I first called she didn’t pick up so I tried my mom to see if she was still at the beach. Thankfully my mom said that my sister hadn’t checked her phone yet so she just handed my sister her phone that I was on instead. I asked for help and instantly got shot down because my sister needed to do laundry. The job would only have taken a couple hours. I also told her in return I could do her laundry instead. She instantly refused and said she just wanted to eat. I asked her to name anything that I could do for her in return and she said no. 

Upon hearing this conversation my parents who were near the phone apparently decided to jump in. My mom asked why I couldn’t and when hearing my reasons she pretty much implied that I was weak and pathetic without saying those exact words and that if she was in my place she just would have pushed past the pain and just felt with it. After hearing those words my sister was adamant she didn’t want to babysit and started actually calling me weak. 

I don’t really ask for much from them and it had been a long and stressful week so my emotions were a bit overwhelmed already. I ended up proving them right because as soon as they said that I burst into tears. I then doubled down asking my sister for help because now I was so emotionally overloaded. My crying only made it worse as my mom hates when I cry and after trying to convince my sister my mom got mad and said I had ruined the family’s entire day. 

I had no dignity or pride left anymore so I just kept crying and asking for my sister’s help. My parents were so frustrated and ended up convincing her finally because they just want the whole thing to end. So now my parents and sister are really mad at me. Am I the AH?

My parents and sister live nearby but don’t help a whole lot because my parents are usually busy with work. So I’m under a lot of stress helping my grandma. 

Every now and then and then I babysit, My sister started babysitting for them when I first moved away from home for college and now that I’m back she’s still the first one they contact to babysit so if I’m babysitting for them it’s because she’s already said she couldn’t. 

I’ve got the classic oldest daughter syndrome in case it wasn’t obvious before, so when my family asks for help I’m always there, even at the cost of my own mental health. I’ve picked up a lot of work for my sister and I think she’s only filled in for me twice. 

I was scheduled to babysit today but it had been a rough week mentally and somehow I strained my neck a couple days prior. I also got a wicked sunburn the day. I then called my sister to ask if she could fill in for me this time instead because I was tired and in pain. I knew she had gone to the beach earlier but had nothing going on during the time I needed her to fill in for. 

When I first called she didn’t pick up so I tried my mom to see if she was still at the beach. Thankfully my mom said that my sister hadn’t checked her phone yet so she just handed my sister her phone that I was on instead. I asked for help and instantly got shot down because my sister needed to do laundry. The job would only have taken a couple hours. I also told her in return I could do her laundry instead. She instantly refused and said she just wanted to eat. I asked her to name anything that I could do for her in return and she said no. 

Upon hearing this conversation my parents who were near the phone apparently decided to jump in. My mom asked why I couldn’t and when hearing my reasons she pretty much implied that I was weak and pathetic without saying those exact words and that if she was in my place she just would have pushed past the pain and just felt with it. After hearing those words my sister was adamant she didn’t want to babysit and started actually calling me weak. 

I don’t really ask for much from them and it had been a long and stressful week so my emotions were a bit overwhelmed already. I ended up proving them right because as soon as they said that I burst into tears. I then doubled down asking my sister for help because now I was so emotionally overloaded. My crying only made it worse as my mom hates when I cry and after trying to convince my sister my mom got mad and said I had ruined the family’s entire day. 

I had no dignity or pride left anymore so I just kept crying and asking for my sister’s help. My parents were so frustrated and ended up convincing her finally because they just want the whole thing to end. So now my parents and sister are really mad at me. Am I the AH?

26,1eupypu,AITA-Kicking My Mom Out?,"Im 25F, married, mom of 3 small children. 
Things are out of control since my mother moved in. She's 56, divorced, retired Army veteran, and until recently, had a job for 9 years. 
She lost it after getting caught napping in the bathroom at work—something she’d bragged about in the past. She was gone so long that her boss went looking for her. 
Rather than face getting fired, she quit. 

She is in good health, Christian, never had alcohol or drugs and no known mental health issues. 
With her having nowhere to go and having alienated most of our family, I felt I had to let her move in, even though we hadn't spoken in over 2 years. 
She is the 4th of 9 siblings, none speak to her. 
All 5 of my older siblings went no-contact with her about 8 years ago. 
My husband and kids had never even met her in person before this.

The first two months were tense but manageable. However, things have taken a turn for the worse with a few minor but two major incidents. 
The first happened when my husband was away for work. We had been exchanging some intimate emails. One night, I went to the kitchen for a glass of water and found my mother using my MacBook. 
She quickly closed it and began apologizing for reading my emails! 
I was shocked when I realized she had seen everything, including some explicit pictures of my husband (I didn’t tell him that part). 
I lost my composure and haven’t been able to talk to her much since, she hides in the guest room, avoiding even her grandchildren. 

The final straw came after a family outing with my hubby and kiddos. 
We had prepared a slow-cook meal in the oven so that dinner would be ready when we returned. 
After being out for about 7 hours, we came home to find our entire meal—a dish meant for six people—gone. Five chicken leg quarters with sides! It was as if animals had ravaged it, but it was just my mother. 
She sat in the living room, hands covering her mouth, eyes wide with shame, saying, “I couldn’t stop! I just couldn’t stop picking at it!” 
There was nothing left but bones and drippings. 

My husband and I were too shocked to speak. 
We retreated to our bedroom in silence, trying to process what had happened while the kids played in the other room. I felt like I was drowning in embarrassment and frustration. 
My mother later knocked on our door and offered to buy us Taco Bell, we just stared at her until she left. 

I called one of my brothers and a sister, both of whom reminded me that they had warned me not to let her move in. My MIL is kind and nurturing, the complete opposite of my mom, and my husband doesn’t know how to exist around her. 
I’ve given her a month to find other living arrangements. 

I’m afraid that if she stays, things will only get worse. 
We feel the need to lock our bedroom door when we aren’t home for the sake of privacy since she’s a snoop. I feel like I’m on the edge. 
It’s only been 3 days since the last episode.

28,1eupn0m,AITA? fight with girlfriend about getting a dog,"All names are fake and on a throwaway

My gf Jessica (f22) and I (m25) just moved in together and we've been looking at getting a dog. I don't want any toy dogs but she loves every kinds of dog so I thought choosing one together would be easy but so far it hasn't. We actually got into a fight about it.

There's one friend she has, named Ruth (f22) who also has a dog and Jessica loves it. Jessica and Ruth met while volunteering at the SPCA in their freshman year. Ruth now works part time at that SPCA. She wanted something similar to Ruth's but I didn't. She's been showing me pictures of dogs that just aren't working for me plus I want to get a puppy but she wants a grown dog although to be fair she wants to get one that's less than 3 years old. And she wants to try fostering first before considering adoption to test out how the dog is with us but I told her it's best to start out young. I thought I convinced her but I didn't like any of the pictures of the puppies she shown me. One was a toy breed. So we're back to square one.

Our fight was basically like this

me-are you sure you want that?

gf-yes that's why i'm showing it to you. what's wrong with this one?

me-why can't we just get a new puppy

gf-i did you didn't want any of the ones they had

me-what if they turned us down

Bc of work, I haven't been able to see her that much because our schedules never matches, except for Tuesday (August 20), where she's planning a little party with all of our close friends and we're gonna have a sleepover to spend her last night together (her flight is in the middle of Wednesday night).

To me, at first the choice was easy because I can see my close family quite regularly (I will miss out on my aunts and some cousins if I don't come but we can still catch up later), and I announced to everyone that wasn't coming, while explaining why.

She tends to come quite often and we kinda just do our own thing. I’m naturally a homebody so if we’re not going out we’re staying in watching movies or playing games. My roommates John (childhood best friend) and Joann (his sister) are very friendly and welcoming to her. I’ve discussed it before with them and they claim they have no problems with her being over so much. Recently the three of us had a roommate meeting discussing boundaries, chores etc. and Joanne decided to bring up the idea of Lisa paying 1/4 of our utilities. Her rationale was that we’re all broke college kids and it didn’t seem fair to her that Lisa was using our utilities so much and not paying for it. At first I agreed and thought it was fair, however the more I thought about it, it started to feel wrong and Lisa thought so too. To be fair Lisa takes quick showers when she visits me after work to freshen up and well sometimes shower together after swimming but that’s about it. She doesn’t drink from our water jugs because she always brings her own bottle. If WiFi is the issue she said she’d just use her own data. It’s not like Lisa uses our utilities without me, it’s always me that uses them. I cook for us so it’s not like she’s using it herself as well. With all that being said I can definitely see both sides to it but I’m don’t really think charging my gf 1/4 of all utilities fair to her either.

She tends to come quite often and we kinda just do our own thing. I’m naturally a homebody so if we’re not going out we’re staying in watching movies or playing games. My roommates John (childhood best friend) and Joann (his sister) are very friendly and welcoming to her. I’ve discussed it before with them and they claim they have no problems with her being over so much. Recently the three of us had a roommate meeting discussing boundaries, chores etc. and Joanne decided to bring up the idea of Lisa paying 1/4 of our utilities. Her rationale was that we’re all broke college kids and it didn’t seem fair to her that Lisa was using our utilities so much and not paying for it. At first I agreed and thought it was fair, however the more I thought about it, it started to feel wrong and Lisa thought so too. To be fair Lisa takes quick showers when she visits me after work to freshen up and well sometimes shower together after swimming but that’s about it. She doesn’t drink from our water jugs because she always brings her own bottle. If WiFi is the issue she said she’d just use her own data. It’s not like Lisa uses our utilities without me, it’s always me that uses them. I cook for us so it’s not like she’s using it herself as well. With all that being said I can definitely see both sides to it but I’m don’t really think charging my gf 1/4 of all utilities fair to her either.

33,1euosdj,AITA for not inviting my brother’s girlfriend as my plus 1? ,"I have a job in social media for fashion. I get perks like sample sales but I’m a size 12 so there’s very few things I can buy. I also sometimes get gifted designer items like purses or promo items. 

Since it is my JOB I’m actually sick of discussing fashion and since I WFH I have a couple of nice items incase I have a work lunch or something or I might rent clothes but my own stuff isn’t flashy. 

My boyfriend’s new girlfriend Ana is one of those people that thinks you post LV on something it makes it couture. She has this insane idea that she see’s my instagram (remember rent clothes for events) that I have money and I can invite her to these events and sample sales. 

There was a sample sale and my mom asked me about it and I told her I wasn’t planning on going I would have her go as my plus one if she wanted but mom said the date and time didn’t work for her. My mom is classy and had a job in advertising. (My mom got me the ""in"" on my current industry) She knows how to act. My brother’s girlfriend is not one of those people I would want around my peers because many of them would be there.  I barely tolerate her and I told her that this is a work event for me so I take my mom because she has worked in the industry. 

My Ana thinks that the Kardashians and stuff like that are high fashion or putting logos on a bag is classy.  This isn’t the event for her. Even on sale these are not clothes I could afford (or fit into) and mom and I go for the cheaper accessories and maybe mingle for job security, because let’s face it with layoffs everyone in marketing and advertising everyone is on edge. 

I told Ana maybe another one and this event isn’t just open to everyone. My mom saw what was going on and she said how she already has an “in” on this sample sale and that’s why she could go. 

Ana and my brother tried arguing with me and my mom and I said no. Ana can’t go. My mom went as far saying Ana clearly doesn’t know how to be gracious since she has to argue when someone says no.

Ana stormed off calling us gate keeping bitches (directed at both me and my mom) and my brother thinks we should apologize to her and I refuse to citing to my brother this is exactly why I would never invite Ana anywhere.

We come from a traditional brown family where you not listening to your parents is disrespectful even if they say something with no logic and when it comes to marriage they want everything to be their way. So my parents relationship with my uncle initially got bad when he got married at 31. There was just some tension with his wife and my uncles siblings. All stuff that tbh my uncle was right for standing up for his wife. If you’d like I can go in more detail but honestly it’s just like they’re trying to find small faults and find reasons to complain about my uncles wife. At the end of the day even after getting married he still would visit my grandparents, go over for dinner with them etc.  

Also, my dad has a small company for robotics where my uncle worked with him from ages 26-35. Right before my uncle left is where things got quite bad between my parents and him. There was just issues such as him wanting a bit of a raise, and my dad saying he doesn’t work as much as he claims and trying to find ways to see if he’s working by calling him to see where he’s at, or surprise visits to the office. At one point my dad put some security cameras in the office to catch him. By the end my uncle decided to move on to a different company. 

To be honest I think there were mistakes on both sides but to me the world isn’t black and white, obviously my uncle isn’t perfect but to me my relationship with him and his 2 kids is more important than the beef between my parents and him. Lately my parents have been telling my brother, my sister in law and I basically we can’t go there. How they can’t believe we would still talk to someone who did something like that to my dad.(To them him charging extra hours without working and stuff is stealing from them). After we argued and said we’re not going to listen to that, every time they find out we went there they get really passive aggressive and start complaining to some of my aunts.

We’ve always been a close-knit family, and for the past decade, I’ve taken on the responsibility of hosting Thanksgiving at my house. I enjoy having everyone over, but it’s a lot of work, especially since we all have at least 2 kids each (all in the age group 5-15). It’s chaos, but joyful chaos. My husband helps out, but the majority of the planning, cooking, and organizing falls on me.

This year, I decided I need a break. Life has been hectic, and I’m feeling burnt out. Between work, taking care of my kids(10,11M), and other responsibilities, I’m just not up for the task of hosting a big family gathering. So, I suggested that one of my sisters take over hosting Thanksgiving this year.

I brought this up in our family group chat, thinking it would be a reasonable request and it’s plenty ahead of time. However, my two older sisters, Sarah (47) and Emily (44), were not happy with the idea. Sarah has a busy job and a smaller house, so she feels she can’t accommodate everyone comfortably. Emily argued that she’s been dealing with a lot of stress lately and doesn’t have the energy to host. They both suggested that since I’ve been doing it for so long, I should just keep the tradition going, especially since my house is the most spacious and I’m the one who “knows how to do it right.”

My younger sisters were more understanding, but they also hesitated to take on the responsibility. My sister Jessica (38) said she would be willing to help out more with the preparations if I hosted, but she wasn’t confident about hosting the entire event herself. The other younger sisters offered similar compromises, but no one was willing to take on the full load.

After some back and forth, I stood firm and said I really need someone else to host this year. I suggested we could even make it a potluck to ease the burden, but Sarah and Emily were still upset. They accused me of being selfish and abandoning a family tradition that I’ve upheld for years. They argued that I’m the one with the most experience, and that Thanksgiving just wouldn’t be the same if I didn’t host. Now, there’s tension in the family, with my older sisters feeling like I’m letting them down.


I feel like I’ve done my fair share over the years, and it’s not unreasonable to ask for a break. But at the same time, I understand that my older sisters are also under a lot of pressure, and that hosting Thanksgiving is a big deal for our family.

as time went by I realised Perrie had this thing where she wanted everything to be about her... always trying to talk about her, her life...anyways them on the other hand from one look they were perfect, perries bf was close to Cindy, they texted each other but in a sibling way, they always said that they would never look at each other in any way, and quite frankly, they looked like siblings, they'd fight, yell at each other over silly things, joke with each other, Cindy talked about her boy problems with Perries bf.

she told Cindy in a group chat that not everything was about her having a boy problems, maybe others also wanted to talk and the way Cindy made her feel left out whenever we were with her boyfriend was disgusting. Cindy didn't do anything, I even couldn't understand what she did that made perrie that angry, because if sth happened and she felt uncomfortable I think it was her bf's fault for making her feel that way.

Then Perrie came to me and said its not just her but I also felt like an outcast. she made me a part of this bs. I was staying silent, but then she texted me privately and told me that she was right, she didn't leave me alone so I told her she was imagining stuff and if she felt that way she had to also discuss it with her bf. if she doesn't trust him or her best friend than what's the point of having a relationship? she came onto me and said that I always choose Cindy over her... I may not be best at telling but I think I made it clear with my actions that I cared about her before... so I didn't want her to lose sth because of a stupid reason so I told her the truth.

she couldn't take it, never admitted that she was wrong, never decided to work this thing out and after that she doesn't even say hello to me at uni, nor to Cindy, its like she decided to go on with her life without us like that.

43,1eun70d,AITA - Kicking My Mother Out??,"I am a (27F), married with three small children. My life was already overwhelming, but it’s been thrown into complete chaos since my mother moved in with us. My mother is 54, a retired Army veteran, and divorced. She used to have a job, but she lost it after getting caught taking long naps in the bathroom during work hours—something she used to brag about. This time, she disappeared for so long that her boss had to go looking for her. Knowing she was about to be fired, she quit instead. With nowhere else to go and having burned bridges with everyone in the family, I felt like I had no choice but to let her move in with us, though it was only supposed to be for six months.

She’s in good health, Christian, and has never touched alcohol, drugs, or cigarettes, but she’s not easy to get along with. We hadn’t spoken in two years, and my five older siblings cut her off completely about eight years ago. My husband and kids had never even met her in person until she moved in with us.

It’s been two months since she moved in, and things have been awkward, but we managed—until now. There were two incidents that have completely shattered any hope I had that this could work.

The first happened when my husband was out of town for work. We had been exchanging some intimate emails late at night, nothing out of the ordinary for us. But one night, I walked into the kitchen for some water and found my mother sitting in the living room with my MacBook. She looked up at me and immediately closed the laptop in a panic. When I confronted her, she started rambling and apologizing—she had been reading our emails. I was furious, especially when I saw she had come across explicit pictures we had sent each other. It was beyond humiliating. I haven’t been able to speak to her much since then, and now our home feels cold and tense. She hides away in the guest room, avoiding even her grandchildren.

But the latest incident was the breaking point. My husband and I planned a day out with the kids, and we prepared a slow-cook meal in the oven so dinner would be ready when we got back. After being out for about seven hours, we returned home to find our entire meal—four chicken leg quarters with sides—completely gone! It looked like animals had gotten into it, but it was just my mother. She was sitting in the living room, hands covering her mouth, eyes wide with shame. All she could say was, “I couldn’t stop! It was so good, I just couldn’t stop picking at it, little by little!” But she had eaten everything, leaving only bones and drippings. This is no exaggeration! 

My husband and I were too stunned to even speak. We just retreated to our bedroom in silence, the kids’ laughter echoing from the playroom while I fought back tears. I apologized to my husband, feeling utterly defeated. Then my mother knocked on our door, offering to buy us Taco Bell, as if that could make up for it. We just stared at her until she left.

Later, I called one of my brothers and a sister, and both of them said, “I told you not to move that woman into your home! She is not your responsibility!!” They were right. 
She hasn’t applied for a single job since coming here and her car will soon be repossessed. 
My mother-in-law is so kind and nurturing, respected in her family and community—my husband has no idea how to deal with someone like my mom.

She has nowhere else to go, but I’m terrified that if she stays, things will only get worse. There have been other points of contention but these 2 top the others. I can feel myself reaching a breaking point, and I’m scared of what might happen if she doesn’t leave. It’s only been three days since the last disaster, and I’m already drowning in hopelessness.

44,1eumman,AITAH for telling my mom to fuck off,"My mom and I (f23) have always had a rocky relationship. I'm currently living with my mom, uncle, grandma, and sister. We don't have much space and that usually a source of our fights. In addition my mom, sister and I (myself to a lesser extent) are victims of narcissistic abuse from my uncle and Grandma.

My mom's car stopped working and so if we need anything to help care for my grandma or basically anything we need outside of the house I have to ask my uncle for a ride. He's been an asshole for years now but will be nice enough to give us rides some times. 

Here's where the fight with my mom started. I needed a ride so we can get food and stuff for the house and my Grandma, my mom told me not to forget that he was just an asshole to me and not to be too nice. I have a history of forgiving ppl before I should and have a lot of issues with codependency.  

I told my mom that I was going and I told her that I needed to get stuff because I don't drive (not by choice, read about MN driver's tests) and this was the only way we can get everything we need for the weekend.

My sister(f22) has a fanny pack with a cord that was hanging down her butt, it looked bad but on top of that it also is something that I know my uncle will have a problem with. He has OCD and is a control freak on top of that. So I tell my sister it's a good idea to either tuck the string in or to use another bag because he's literally tried cutting cords on backpacks and purses if they drag on the floor, by a tire, or on the ground. She runs to my mom and tells her that I'm controlling her and I say that I'm trying to make sure we get everything we need done because her car won't work and we need a bunch of stuff. 

She tells me that my keeping the peace is teaching him that he can abuse me and teaching me to accept patterns of abuse. I said mom we need to get stuff and I don't have another choice and she told me that someone was going to beat me because I'm not willing to confront him so I can get my stuff done..

I acted out and told her fuck off and don't put that shit because it really hurt to hear that from my mom and she said she's done with me for the day. I started crying and begging her to forgive me for swearing at her and I was only acting out because I was hurt by what she said.

She said it came out too easy and I must really have meant it and thought that I meant it. I would have had the same thing to anyone who said I was going to be beat by someone and tried telling her that. 

Am I the asshole for swearing at my mom in this situation?

45,1eult5l,AITA for making a joke about my brother? ,"My brother doesn’t go to college. His girlfriend does. Idek how they met since they’re honestly extreme opposites but whatever works for them I guess.

I generally don’t care about them but I’ve noticed that his gf is quite nerdy. Like she doesn’t seem like it but gosh she talks a lot and her nonstop talking makes it pretty obvious that she knows a lot academically. My brother literally failed a bunch of classes in high school and doesn’t know much more than 1+1 or who his favourite hockey player is so their relationship feels like something out of a corny movie. My sister and I often make jokes wondering what they even talk about LOL. 

My dad brought up some random history fact during dinner the other night and my brother’s gf quite literally lit up. She started talking about it and my dad was happy to entertain her. She then said “I was trying to tell Josh (my brother) about this but he didn’t get it” and I said “Yeah that sounds like Josh.” My brother’s gf immediately got annoyed and said “Well no, not really.” I didn’t expect her to get so heated since my brother didn’t really react so I was like “Yeah I’m just joking.” 

She doubled down and was like “It’s not funny.” I just said I don’t really care and she went on a rant about how my brother is actually really smart and she’s tired of us acting like he isn’t, even joking about it is bad apparently. My sister said “he failed grade 9 english, he’s not exactly the smartest” and his gf was like “I failed grade 9 math who gives a shit. You two are just assholes.” I told her to calm down, and that no one was making fun of her, and that my brother knows we’re joking. But she just left and my brother went after her. 

Now my mom’s on my ass about embarrassing him and that making fun of him and his lack of brains is wrong and bad when literally she didn’t care either until his extremely righteous gf said something. I think my parents just want her validation because I swear to you, my brother does not give shit. He even makes fun of himself. 

But everyone’s mad now and even my sister thinks that we should apologize just to keep the peace. I think they can go suck it.

47,1eulh0q,AITA for calling my friend jealous,"Me (20F) and Nadia (20F) have been friends since we were 12 years old. Rani (20F) was in the same class as both of us when we were in secondary school. I have a closer relationship to Rani than Nadia does with her, now and back then. 

I currently don't have any public active social media. I like to keep my online interests and activity separate to my real life. This means that I have no other way to contact my friends unless I have their mobile phone number. As all my friends are introverts we have an understanding that it's ok to go through long periods of time without talking to each other and to take our time responding back. We joke about having a low maintenance friendship. 

My phone recently shut down on me and I bought a new one. I was unable to recover my contact details and other things. Prior to my phone not working, I was in a conversation with Rani and she asked me about meeting up with our former classmates at a restaurant. I didn't get a chance to respond. Nadia was never invited because she chose not to be in contact with them when we were in school. 

Last weekend, Nadia contacted me and we were able to make brunch plans. At brunch, I told her about losing all my contacts and that I had lost Rani's number. I wanted to reach out and tell that I wanted to go to the restaurant if it hadn't already happened. 

Since, Nadia has Rani's number, I asked for it. Nadia said no. She said that she hates when people give out her number without her permission and she won't do that to Rani.

She said no she doesn't want to contact anyone from school anymore.

Typically, my boyfriend and I have a strong relationship, and things go smoothly from Monday through Friday. However, when his children arrive on Saturday mornings, the dynamic changes. He becomes dismissive, blocks me on communication platforms, turns off his location, and exhibits other similar behaviors. 

We've attended therapy to address these issues, but it seems that the situation is only worsening. Unfortunately, this has led to feelings of resentment towards his children, even though I recognize that they are innocent in all of this.

50,1eukb4z,AITA for asking my bf to pay my bills?,"I (25f) has been together with my partner (25m) for 5 years, living together for 4 years. 

TLDR; my rich bf of 5 years wants to keep the 50/50 finances while I don’t.

We only had a platonic acquaintance at first, because I met him when I was still together with my ex (31f). My ex and I had just moved to another country together and I broke up soon after, because of her DV that worsened after we moved away from friends and family. 

Some time after the breakup, I reached out to him and soon we became romantic after hanging out as friends. There were many green flags, like I connected well to both his male and female friends, as well as his family. He his known for his empathy, humility and kindness which are the qualities that attracted me ultimately to him. 

BUT something I did not realise as an immigrant when we met is that he comes from a rich family. As in the literal 1% living in the most expensive neighbourhood in one of the richest countries on earth. I am very open about my socialist views and he found them interesting. He has slowly introduced me to his wealth, which I still have not seen the full scope of. His family is very secret about it, and I don’t want to pry. 

I have since the start of our relationship asked for 50/50 split, including paying rent, electricity, wifi, food-subscription, gas and so on. He has loaned me money in instances of economic turmoil, like when I lost my job from Corona or when I got scammed out of a scholarship. I am always insisting on paying back, even when he says I don’t have to. 

He has not looked for jobs since he finished a masters in economics two months ago, and to be honest, I think it will be hard for him to fit in a corporate environment being the sensitive professor type. I do not mind him not working if he does the majority of housework. I graduated last year and was at one point balancing two jobs, paying back around a 1000 usd in student loans each month. My income is in the lowest 5% and minimum wage, because I took a bachelor in acting (bad decision). 

I want to apply to law school next year, because I have the passion and the grades for a full scholarship. So I asked him if he would be willing to cover our shared expenses comparable to the percentages of our incomes. My scholarship would be 880 usd a month compared to his 3000 usd he gets in passive income each month (family). I would be paying 30% of our expenses, but it would be lower if he got a salary on top of the passive income. 

We see marriage and kids 10 years into the future, and he agrees that the plan I am offering fits there, just not now. But I am tired. I am tired of cooking while he orders. I am tired of taking public to work saturday morning, while he took a taxi home from the club. I am tired of having a messy home from working all day, while he doesn’t have a job and can afford help.

yesterday, i got home to find my family was out, and that the dog had taken a huge diarrhea dump in the living room. chunky peanut butter kind of diarrhea. i usually clean up if i find her poop around, but this was a bit beyond me, so i sent a message on the family group chat to let them know what happened. she seemed to be up and fine tho, so i wasnt very concerned. my parents however, were kind of pissed when they came back home to find the dump in the living room. they said i should have cleaned it up since i was the only one at home when i found it. i argued that i dont expect anyone to help when my cat messes up stuff, and that they used to leave peed-on furniture for me to clean up after getting home from work when that happened.

I just simply had enough of the system at the time that I just cut my losses and moved on. It hasn't stopped me from having stable jobs, even if none were high paying.

Recently I was added to the group of graduates from the school I went to, and I stated that I was simply a drop out. The school never sent me a diploma, called for me to get one, and refused to honor one when I called. The school at the time stated that even if I had all the last classes needed, I was missing a few on the way (I had history 11th, not 10th for one, I know I had English 12th but not 9th for some). I was simply a delinquent that liked playing video games until 1 a.m. and waking up at 4 a.m. to watch anime over reading and homework.

People on there simply gave reasonings as to why I dropped out, some were true, some not (and I let them know if stories were accurate or not), but that I was part of the classes, so a piece of paper wouldn't make a difference. I do agree with them, and I don't really care about being in the group (there's like 2 posts a year), only that I was a dropout, so I shouldn't be considered a graduate.

I 85 M lives in India, recently my brother-in-law's lets call him Jay son in constructing there house. To give you the context of the house design, here in India house are right next to each other there is not space in between the houses. So, to have a quite sitting area in our back, I left 10ft X 10ft area and immediately after the that area Jay have stated the construction of his house and soon after the construction starts chunks of bricks, dust, cement etc. keep falling in my back area. That is all fine because of the construction going on but here is the problem there are drainage pipes in my back area and I have asked Jay to please clean debris, dust or anything that falls on my back yard as it is rainy season here and if the debris go to my drainage pipes it will block them and if they are blocked then I have to dug them up and install new ones which will cost around $5000 (a lot in India) but despite asking Jay and his wife to clean the back area they didn't clean it and my grandson has to clean them because it started raining and I didn't want my drains to be clogged.



Then on 15th august, when I was away, he came with the workers and despite my wife's and grandson's asking them to spread a plastic sheet on the ground so that the cement and debris that fall from the wall it will fall on the plastic sheet and if it rains then we can just pick the plastic sheet and put it side, and at the end of the day it will be easy to clean. But when I came home there were not plastic sheet and my whole back area was covered in cement, dust and very small chunks of bricks, move over it start raining and me and grandson did our best to clean all the cement and dirt but it was not enough and some them got in my drainage pipe but it was not clogged. Then I told the works to stop with the construction and called Jay. He arrived around noon and asked why I am have told the workers to stop. And I told Jay every thing and the argument becomes more heated by the minute and then he said that I am jealous of him that he is constructing his house. And after that I said that unless he put a plastic sheet to cover the ground before applying cement I will not allow to start the resume the construction.



Now Jay is call all our relatives and saying that we are not letting him finish his construction and they are calling me and asking me to let him start his construction. AITA.

58,1euh7by,AITA for asking my landlord for remote access to the thermostat and doorbell camera? ,"I (21F) and my roommate (21F) both moved into our townhouse 2 months ago because we just got our first big girl jobs. I found this townhouse to live in because my aunt (who I’m really close with) has been best friends with the owner (20+ years) and the owner’s daughter is already living there for college. They agreed for me and my roommate to rent there because there were two more bedrooms on the property. Me and my roommate really appreciated that there was also a 1 car garage that the landlord told us wasn’t occupied since both of us drive to work. We signed the lease and I THOUGHT everything was fine. 

A couple weeks after I moved in - there was some issues with access to the garage because apparently the owner was under the impression that the garage wasn’t part of our lease and needed to park her car there permanently. We eventually worked it out that there would be a garage schedule once everyone moved in. 

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago. After I was granted access to the house’s Google nest camera and thermostat, it was suddenly revoked, days later. I texted the landlord about the issue 5 times. My roommate and my mom who my landlord has been talking with did the same. He refused to respond to us until we got an email 3 days ago saying that although the lease stated that “the nest camera and nest thermostat would be provided” we would not be provided remote access to the thermostat or any access to the nest camera. This is a huge issue for me because my bedroom is the only one on the basement floor where the front door is so I was hoping to get alerts for if someone was attempting a break-in. The reasons that the landlord stated in the email was because since they are paying for electricity they need to monitor that the HVAC system wouldn’t cause huge spikes in electricity bills for them and that it could be a possible security concern for us to have access to the nest footage. However, he also stated that since the owners daughter was also an owner of the property - she would be the only one who had remote access to the thermostat and access to the nest camera. This doesn’t really help my situation because her bedroom is on the third floor and she doesn’t live here 50% of the time.

I (21F) and my roommate (21F) both moved into our townhouse 2 months ago because we just got our first big girl jobs. I found this townhouse to live in because my aunt (who I’m really close with) has been best friends with the owner (20+ years) and the owner’s daughter is already living there for college. They agreed for me and my roommate to rent there because there were two more bedrooms on the property. Me and my roommate really appreciated that there was also a 1 car garage that the landlord told us wasn’t occupied since both of us drive to work. We signed the lease and I THOUGHT everything was fine. 

A couple weeks after I moved in - there was some issues with access to the garage because apparently the owner was under the impression that the garage wasn’t part of our lease and needed to park her car there permanently. We eventually worked it out that there would be a garage schedule once everyone moved in.

59,1eugkf2,AITA for not moving treadmills at the gym so two friends could run next to each other,"I’m training for a marathon, and I was doing intervals on a treadmill at the gym in my apartment the other day. My apartment gym is small–there are only 3 treadmills–but it works for what I need, since I basically only use it if the weather prohibits me from running outside. Of the three treadmills, the middle one is my favorite. It is newer and smoother, and the console is higher.

So on that day, I was doing my 5’ on/1’ off intervals on the middle treadmill when these two people got in front of the treadmill to get my attention. I thought it was an urgent matter, so I took one headphone out, but they just asked if I could move to one of the side treadmills. They said they wanted to run next to each other and asked if I could move to one of the treadmills on the side. I said no and put my headphone back in. I thought that would be the end, but they stayed in front of me, waving in front of me and nagging (I couldn’t hear their exact words through my headphones). When I got to my rest period, I asked what was up. They asked why I wouldn’t move and I said “I’m doing intervals.” They looked at me confused and said I could just move and it would take like five seconds. I told them if they wanted this treadmill they should have gotten here before I did, and to stop bothering me.

I didn’t have the necessary breath to explain this, but since I was doing very strict interval training that was programmed, I couldn’t interrupt it. Also, it would just throw off my vibe. Also, the middle treadmill is my favorite, and I was there first. When I got to the lobby, one of the girls was waiting for me. She told me I was very rude and that I should be banned from the gym for my conduct. I was like, “Girl, it’s a treadmill. It’s not that deep.” She said I was lucky she didn’t film me and get me in a Joey Swoll video (mind you, I’m a girl, too). At this point, of the guys working the front desk came up and asked if she was bothering me (she was getting very heated and I was staying calm). I said yes. He told her to leave me alone or he would call security. The girl begrudgingly left.

When I retold this story to my friends, all my running friends were fully with me. One of them was like, “interrupting someone’s workout should be a felony.” Some of my non-running friends, however, were a bit on the fence. Some of them think it was rude that I didn’t give an explanation (I was out of breath because I was doing intervals). One of my friends also brought up a point that while I’m a runner and I use the gym for sport-specific training, most other residents probably use that gym more casually, and it’s not fair for me to expect them to meet the same gym standards and I should have just moved, or at least explained.

60,1eufvtj,AITA for not being present with my friend for 30 minutes while he was very drunk?,"So the other day I (18) was at a small ""party"" at one of my friends houses with 9-10 people. We were playing drinking games and having fun. After a couple hours, one of my friends asked if I wanted to have a smoke with him before he was leaving, and I said yes. After about 5-10 minutes, while we were about to head out, the friend in question (we'll call him Jeff) asked me to come over to the sofa where he was laying to talk to me. He told me he was drunk and that  he wanted me to help him get home. I assured him I would get him home, and told him that I was going out for a while since I planned to have a smoke with a few of the people that were leaving, and that I would come right up after a while. I told him I would be right downstairs (we were sitting on a bench right outside the apartment complex, takes two minutes to get up), and that if he needed me or anything to give me a call. Keep in mind that he was very safe where he was at, both of us know the host, and including the host there was my girlfriend and one more friend to watch over him if anything happened.

I was outside the apartment complex having a fun conversation with the people outside, but after 30-35 minutes or so we wrapped it up and they were leaving. I said my goodbyes, and went back up to the apartment. When I arrived, Jeff had thrown up in the bathroom floor and was not in the best state. I asked him what happened and if he was okay, and he told me he was fine and kind of shrugged it off. My girlfriend then told me he made her call his dad to come pick him up, and that he was on his way. At this time all of the other people had left, and there was only the host, Jeff, my girlfriend and I. We sat down at the sofa to watch TV while we waited for his dad. I asked him what happened, how he was feeling and so on. He had an annoyed tone and told me something along the words of ""so much for taking care of me..."". Keep in mind I was literally right downstairs and he never gave me a call or anything. 

After a while his dad arrived, and he asked me to accompany him. When we arrived at the street I said hello to his dad, and he wasn't very nice. He had a very passive aggressive and confrontational tone, and was essentially mad at me for not taking care of his son, and looked down on me for essentially having a fun time while his son didn't. I have met his dad before and had absolutely no problems with him. I went back up to the apartment to help the host clean up a bit after the party, and eventually went home with my girlfriend. 

The people I've talked to about this have said that it was very irrational of him and especially his dad, because I was right downstairs and he never gave me a call and I didn't leave him in an unsafe space at all. No one told me to come up, and I had no idea what was going on upstairs while I was outside. But regardless I want an unbiased opinion, and I really want to know if I was in the wrong in this, I'm not making this post to get validation from anyone, I'm genuinely wondering. AITA?


Edit: No I do not own a car. I had not spoken to him prior to the party, I was not planning on taking him home. He lives like 45 minutes away with public transport, which I would've happily taken with him if he wanted to. He never told me he wanted to leave, and he didn't clarify what ""making sure he got home"" meant, so I assumed it was either following him on public transport or just making sure he didn't get stranded.

61,1eufja7,AITA for returning the electric bike my dad got me?,"

It was last year for Christmas. I never hinted that i wanted a bike, i never showed interest in a bike but he got me this SUPER expensive electric bike and although it’s beautiful and i’m very thankful it’s more like a nuisance to me. 

I live in an apartment on the third floor, i’m a weak female and i cannot carry that down the stairs and then back up. It’s just not worth the headache. 

That bike is beautiful and i have to carry these heavy ass locks around just to chain it up and go somewhere but i don’t want to be paranoid about people messing with it when i’m in a store or in class. 

I don’t want to deal with men harassing me about the bike, asking me questions and potentially beating my ass to get the bike. 

I feel so fucking guilty and i hate looking at it because it’s like a horrible weight in my chest. I love my dad but he just didn’t really think it through and because of his personality i don’t want to be called ungrateful and a waste of money. 

I feel like i cannot express how much i don’t like it. He seemed so excited to give it to me and i feel horrible about it

EDIT: I gave the money back and was called an asshole because i looked ungrateful and hurt his feelings. He put a lot of effort into the gift and I know he did but i literally could not do anything with the bike without horrible anxiety.

62,1euf0r0,AITA for writing about my maternal grandma as the living woman I admire the most and not my stepmom?,"This could get rambly, sorry. My mom died 10 years ago. I (16f) was 6. My parents were separated for two or maybe three years and in the final stages of their divorce. So I knew they weren't getting back together and I knew my dad had a girlfriend at the time. I met her a year later. They'd been together 2 already but dad delayed us meeting because of my mom dying and I didn't want to meet her. I was really against meeting my stepmom for a while. I told dad I didn't want to replace my mom. He was really desperate for us to meet and for us to get along so he pushed it and it backfired because I basically retreated into myself and I didn't say a word to her the first time we met. I also cried so hard when my emotions burst out after an hour of her trying to talk to me. Dad had to call my (maternal) grandma for help who was basically my best support after mom died. Grandma was sick with caner at the time, had lost her only child and her husband but was still there for me.

Anyway, grandma told dad I needed therapy and she paid for me to go since dad couldn't really afford it. I started therapy a few weeks after meeting my stepmom. I met her a few more times before it started but didn't handle it any better. Eventually, with therapy, I was less against her being around and talked to her a bit, even started to like her. But I never saw her as my mom. To be fair they didn't push that on me either. She told me when we had met a lot more times that I could call her whatever so I always called her by her first name. When she and dad got married I was his best girl. When my 2 half sisters and half brother were born I loved them and we're close. But I'm still closest to my grandma. She's amazing.

My stepmom and I are closer than we were before. But after a few years and especially after my siblings were born she started to wish we could be closer and she reached out to me and offered to be my second mom if I wanted that and I told her I didn't. She was sad and she told me. I noticed after that she changed toward me. Not in a negative way but in that she was trying to show up as a mom and be closer to me. A few times dad told me I had to go along with her so it wouldn't hurt her as badly. Like when she booked us for a mother/daughter spa day package for Mother's Day. 

There was an assignment I had to do for a writing club a part of. We were asked to write about the living woman we admire the most and I wrote about my grandma. It got published in the club newsletter which is how my dad and stepmom found out about it and they asked me about it. Stepmom told me she was hurt I wouldn't write about her and she asked why I was never willing to give her being a second mom a chance. Dad told me I should have declined the assignment since they're always optional or chosen to write about my stepmom since my grandma always gets my praises and I made it public that grandma is more important than my stepmom.

65,1eudpza,AITA for making a bet that a girl was in love with me? ,"This girl, let's call her M, and I, have had a tumultuous situationship in the past. A while ago, things took a turn for the worse and she left unexpectedly. My friends saw this as a sign that things were over, and I told them I didn't think so, for two reasons: 

1) I know how M is, she's strongly avoidant. If she reacted so erratically/impulsively to drop everything and leave one day, it's *because* she has strong feelings for me and was scared for them and felt the need to do something drastic. Strong unresolved feelings--> she'll be back. 2) I know she cares about me, and I know she knows leaving this way without saying anything hurts me, so she'll feel guilty, and this will fester, and she'll want to fix things and make me feel better. 

My friends said I was just coping, but I was genuinely confident enough in my prediction to offer a $500 bet that she's in love with me and will be back. One of my friends took my bet. 

A few months ago, she came back into my life. At first I was wary it would be a case of her leaving again randomly, but she has stuck around and made measures that prevent her from doing so again.

This girl, let's call her M, and I, have had a tumultuous situationship in the past. A while ago, things took a turn for the worse and she left unexpectedly. My friends saw this as a sign that things were over, and I told them I didn't think so, for two reasons: 

1) I know how M is, she's strongly avoidant. If she reacted so erratically/impulsively to drop everything and leave one day, it's *because* she has strong feelings for me and was scared for them and felt the need to do something drastic. Strong unresolved feelings--> she'll be back. 2) I know she cares about me, and I know she knows leaving this way without saying anything hurts me, so she'll feel guilty, and this will fester, and she'll want to fix things and make me feel better. 

My friends said I was just coping, but I was genuinely confident enough in my prediction to offer a $500 bet that she's in love with me and will be back. One of my friends took my bet. 

A few months ago, she came back into my life. At first I was wary it would be a case of her leaving again randomly, but she has stuck around and made measures that prevent her from doing so again.

I thought this was a bit much for her to be asking(was literally the first day of texting) and eventually it led no where. Well a year later I notice that on her story she had dropped out of college and started OnlyFans(no judgement here) and was pretty explicit on there. She also would go on nights out and would wear outfits that didn't leave much to the imagination(again no judgement just a fact) and was very flirty around guys.

67,1eudb4z,AITA for abandoning and telling my mom I hated her gift?,"I have come here to ask this and what to do. I feel lost.

At the time, I was 16 when this happened. I had been struggling a lot with my mental health which caused me to fall behind in school. It was so bad that I had gotten 0 credits for a whole grade. Luckily, I was able to pick myself up and bring my grade up enough to be able to graduate! Yes, it wasn't my top A score like before but I was proud of myself. Later that year, my mom told me she had got this and held out a jewelry box. Info, my mom is the type of gifter who gets a $25 gift card for anyone. I’m a sentimental gifter who takes the time to give meaningful gifts. Most of the time, I will draw something a person cherishes as a gift (important). 

So when I saw this jewelry box, I was genuinely surprised. “This is for all your hard work and improving ur grades! Open” Excited, I lifted the lid to see a gold cuff with small diamonds implanted within this beautiful design in the middle.  “I got this made by famous jewelry maker! I re-sketched the drawing so it would fit,” “Which one? I don’t recognize this,” I stated. I’ve drawn a lot so it’s possible that I didn’t remember this one. I mean, I can’t remember a single time when I was not at least doodling. That’s how impactful it was on my life. “This one. It’s so pretty and I fell in love with it. This is your best work ever!” She pulls up to show an old drawing.

“Mom.”

“Yes?”

“That’s an old friend's drawing.”

“Well, I drew over it so u can think of it as mine instead haha”

“ok, thanks mom”

I went to my room in shock. I have been drawing for almost my entire life. I can’t remember a single time when I was not at least doodling. I’ve dedicated my entire life to learning and improving my art. 

She chose hers.

There’s drawings framed all over the halls and she has bins and bins of drawings I’ve made since I could walk. 

She chose hers.

I’ve been showing her every single thing I’ve made, from projects and small doodles in math class. Out of the hundreds-even thousands of drawings I have made, she chose hers. 

This gift was something that was more connective to me than any gift card she had gotten me. Yet it isn't even my own drawing. The only drawing she had ever praised since I’ve started was one that wasn’t even mine. Later, I gave it back to her. She kept putting it back on my desk for a week until convo,

 “do you really not want this?” 

“Yes”

“Why? Is it not the right size or uncomfortable? It will cost more than it already is but I can get it done. This maker is very good and can get it done-”

“No I don't want it.”

“Why? Do u not like it”

“I hate it”

Later that night, I heard her crying. She was telling my dad how she just wanted to do something nice for me and give me something for making it through the hardships. Ever since, I feel really bad about hurting my mom yet I can’t shake off the hurt I felt when I got it. It’s affected me so much that I stopped drawing altogether since then.

I found out my boyfriend of 1 year was cheating on but Iive with him so was stuck there after my surgery. I live abroad with no family here. My sister has come to London to look after me post surgery, so my parents have paid for everything for her. Expensive airbnb, flights etc. The plan was for me to stay in this airbnb with her. She asked our parents to book a 2 bed flat because she didn’t want to share a bed with me. My only requirements are for no stairs and a walk in shower as I am not mobile at the moment. After booking this she organised the same flight as her friend, and then told me the friend would also be staying there (for free). I told her that I will be recovering from surgery, am not in a good mental space and would not feel comfortable with a stranger staying with us. I also told my parents this but they ignored how I felt, said the friend was only staying a couple of nights here and there, and that I was being silly. I said ok. I have been staying at my flat with my ex-bf until the friend leaves. The friend had been there 3 days, but then the next person she was supposed to stay with (also for free) cancelled so she will just stay in our airbnb for another week. She did not ask my sis if this was ok. I asked my sister if she was ok with this, she said no. So I told her to message the friend, say she can stay another evening but if she can please look for some alternative accomodation for the following day. I have been staying with my ex-bf which is very uncomfortable to give her time to find a place. Now the friend has found a hotel and is not speaking to my sister. My parents say this is all my fault. I was having a breakdown before with my surgery and the pain plus breakdown of my relationship but I can’t cope with all this extra stress now. I communicated that I wasn’t comfortable before but they went ahead anyway and my father says I am incredibly selfish and that I have ruined my sisters holiday.

There are plenty of airbnbs in London and I was even happy to share a bed with my sister but she picked a place that is not suitable for my basic care. I think she picked the two bed place, which is much more expensive for my parents, just so the friend could stay too. I am feeling so awful but also like my sister is taking advantage of the situation, having a free holiday with her friend. Now all my family are saying it’s my fault but I can’t move anywhere without assistance. She has spent majority of this time she has been in London with her friend.

74,1euc5rv,AITA for planning on moving to England without speaking to my mum first? ,"18m from Northern Ireland. Results day was the other day and while I got decent results, relatively anyway, I didn’t meet my offer so had to go through clearing. 

I found this really good course at a university in England. For those reading who aren’t familiar with the whole process, clearing is process for people who didn’t meet their university offer, but  lot of people don’t so places need to be filled. If you meet the minimum requirements courses will take you on and it’s a first come first served basis so you need to be quick for good courses, which this one definitely is. 

I spent some time looking into the area, the uni and if they still had accommodation available and what that looked like. I applied and they said yes, I booked my accommodation and got everything sorted. 

I told my mum (she was busy at the time) once I could and she was really mad that I made such a big decision without speaking to her and talked down to me about how because I’m
Adult as of 3 months ago doesn’t mean I just do whatever without consulting anyone first. 

She ranted for a while about all the negatives of this situation, that to her knowledge I was going somewhere half an hour away and now suddenly I’m a boat away, how I’m insane as I’ve only seen pictures and read things about the place and haven’t actually been there and if I end up hating it and drop out all the money I would’ve wasted. Etc basically think about anything that could maybe go wrong or could be a negative about my situation and imagine a woman screaming about it. This went on for some time. 

Also when I mentioned my dad (they’re divorced) said he’d go down with me and help me with moving stuff and all that she got mad I told him first, even though she was literally busy and couldn’t be contacted. Apparently that was disrespectful because I live with her so my first priority should’ve been telling her despite the fact she couldn’t be reached.

So my girlfriend's friend  is getting married, my girlfriend's friend has ANOTHER friend who works in professional photography. That friend has access to this professional studio where, among other things, they have lots of different suits and dresses for couples to wear for photos. Like a lot, most of it is boxed up and in surplus.  So my gf and her friend and a bunch of other friends were going there to help the friend who's getting married try on dresses (she's not planning on wearing any of these dresses to her actual wedding but she wants to try them in case she changes her mind).

When they got there they decided for all of them to try on different wedding dresses just for fun to see how they fit, my girlfriend among them. I wasn't there for the entire thing, I was like 95% of the time downstairs on my phone but I would occassionally text my girlfriend to see how she was doing. She'd often text me to come up, look at a new dress she was wearing, take photos, then go back down.

At one point, I was taking a photo of my gf in one of the wedding dresses, but it wasn't fitting on properly, it sorta kept sliding down. The friend who's getting married said to my girlfriend ""this wouldn't happen if you actually had boobs"" (my gf is very very small chested).  I instantly burst out laughing cause this came out of nowhere but i stifled my laugh, and I admit this was very very wrong of me and I've apologised.

My gf was already in a bad mood, she said to her friend ""we can't all have bodies that look like a pornstar"" referring to the body type of the girl who's getting married. I also laughed at this, which I shouldn't have.  This erupted into an argument that escalated, I took my gf home to de-escalate things. I sincerely apologised for my laughing many times.

We haven't been officially uninvited from the wedding but I've been saying to my gf she should apologise and they were both in the wrong, cause I'm worried we might officially get uninvited and that would be the end of the friendship forever.

80,1euap59,AITA for telling my parents I struggled with making friends?,"I (18F) wanted to go for a friend’s graduation party two months ago and they didn’t let me. I decided to write a note trying to explain to my parents why I value my friendships and they completely flipped out on me. For starters I’ve written my parents notes before as I wanted to be clear and not emotional, and they were not the nicest and they were mean rants so this time I wrote a nicer one, focused more on me rather than what they did. I even asked trusted leaders in my life to find any disrespect and they said it was okay and straightforward. My parents however flipped out and started yelling at me.

The note summarized my experiences. I’ve always felt like the odd one out in friend groups and never felt like I fit in. I switched schools in 7th grade to a K-12 school and it was abrupt and I struggled making new friends when everyone was established. In 8th grade COVID happened I did start to make didn’t really talk to me as I did not have a cellphone. I only spoke to my family and didn’t talk to my friends. Luckily in 9th grade I caught up with my old friend group and had fun with them but they left the school to different high schools. It was lonely the first few months because I knew people but they weren’t close to me at first and they already built relationships during the pandemic online. During the pandemic I had secret social media accounts because I felt like I was going insane during the time and my parents got mad and wrote it off as me being sneaky and bad. The pandemic and moving schools had affected my ability to make friends and I struggled with mental health. My parents were also fighting a lot and I had no escape and I felt like I was going insane. 

I thought my parents would understand but they were livid. I had a small section in my note about how I felt like my parents weren’t the easiest to talk to, but I didn’t say anything negative about then. They told me I had bashed them and was being dramatic because “everyone went through COVID” and I wasn’t special and told me I would have to make new friends regardless in life. My mom told me how she felt I hated the family and thought nothing of them.

I haven’t been the kindest to my parents over the years though and I’ve been acknowledging that. My parents are Nigerian so they believe in corporal punishment so I was hit a lot and screamed at as a child. I’ve internalized that anger and took it back to them.

Sometimes I wonder if I am being dramatic and holding onto grudges for longer than need be and am bashing my parents.

It was lonely the first few months because I knew people but they weren’t close to me at first and they already built relationships during the pandemic online. During the pandemic I had secret social media accounts because I felt like I was going insane during the time and my parents got mad and wrote it off as me being sneaky and bad. The pandemic and moving schools had affected my ability to make friends and I struggled with mental health. My parents were also fighting a lot and I had no escape and I felt like I was going insane. 

I thought my parents would understand but they were livid. I had a small section in my note about how I felt like my parents weren’t the easiest to talk to, but I didn’t say anything negative about then. They told me I had bashed them and was being dramatic because “everyone went through COVID” and I wasn’t special and told me I would have to make new friends regardless in life. My mom told me how she felt I hated the family and thought nothing of them.

I haven’t been the kindest to my parents over the years though and I’ve been acknowledging that. My parents are Nigerian so they believe in corporal punishment so I was hit a lot and screamed at as a child. I’ve internalized that anger and took it back to them.

Sometimes I wonder if I am being dramatic and holding onto grudges for longer than need be and am bashing my parents. AITA?",0.0,-0.0050007943,0,1
81,1euamyh,AITA for not putting the trashcan in before the day end,"Hi, we moved to a new house 6 months ago and we have no problem with the HOA until recently. And stupid as it sounds it’s about trashcan. 
Recently a neighbor keep harassing us about the trashcan that we need put it inside our backyard which is understandable, but the regulated trashcan that they gave us doesn’t pass our gate that’s why we put it outside on the side of our house (still in property not on the street) for the last 6 months and before that with the old owner. 
Then recently, on trash day we pushed our trash cans outside on the street for pick up and went to attend our business til around 9pm, when we came home the trash cans were not there. Instead they were in front of our front door with a note saying of the neighbor saying “thanks” then leave his number, which is weird for me cause other houses still have their trash cans out and only our house got targeted. We didn’t think of it much and it happened again after a week. 
Now this weird us out cause they send us a notice that will take us to court for leaving our trash cans out and the pictures they took is on trash day after the truck just takes the trash. And when we voice our problems to the manager of the neighborhood, she said that we are in the wrong and that the neighbor is a savior that’s helping us.

82,1euakjo,"AITA for yelling at my future in-laws over the ""OXFORD STUDY""","Throwaway

I (56M) have been married to my wife (56F) for 30 years. We have 2 kids together Aurelian (26M) and Ophelia (24F). My wife is Korean and I am Russian. Naturally, both my children are Wasian. They grew up in my culture as well as my wife's. We are both 2nd generation immigrants, but we have tried to preserve much of our cultures while raising our kids and they are both trilingual. We live in the US.

Aurelian has recently proposed to his girlfriend of 6 years, Sofia. My wife and I were overjoyed since Aurelian has expressed how much he cares for Sofia over the years and she is always welcome in our home. However, Sofia's parents (particularly her father) have made jabs over the years about my wife and my relationship. Sofia is a 3rd generation Korean and both her parents are Korean. They often make remarks about how my beautiful and intelligent has no business being with an average white man like me. And how my ""certain attributes"" are probably why my wife ""picked"" me.

I do agree that my wife is beautiful and extremely intelligent, she's a doctor and has always been a fit and lovely woman. I feel blessed to have her in my life and feel that she is much out of my league. However, the consistent jabs have hurt me and my wife though she tries to ignore them for the sake of our son.

A few days ago, my wife invited my future in-laws to have dinner with us at our family home with the new fiances. My wife hates cooking, but is a wonderful baker and made a cake that morning. When my in-laws saw me come out of the kitchen in a apron, they laughed and said ""well there's another reason besides OP's whiteness that attracted \[wife\] to him."" 

My wife told me to ignore them and tried to maintain peace, but during the dinner Sofia saw our wedding photo on the mantel and told my wife how beautiful she looked on our wedding (like I said, my wife is a stunner).  Before my wife could respond, Sofia's father jumped in and said ""but look at OP, the only reason he ever got hitched to such a beauty is cause of the OXFORD STUDY.""

That's when I had it. I yelled at them to get out of my house and to not ever disrespect my marriage ever again. My wife is intelligent and kind, it infuriated me to see this man boil her down to a mindless fetishizer and our marriage to be one of such disgrace and not of them love and respect that we have for one another. They left with Sofia and has since blown up our phones, threatening to not allow Sofia to marry Aurelian.

Aurelian is understandably upset, but understands why I reacted that way. My wife is on my side, however my daughter told us that ""we knew what we were getting into when we married one another"" and that I should've held my temper.

83,1euaijh,AITA for sending our wedding band home mid-party when I found out my ex is one of the members?,"Got married yesterday. When we arrived at the reception venue, everything was already in place. It was not until when were called up for our first dance that I recognized the singer from the band to be my ex gf from high school. We haven't talked for over 15 yrs. My wife doesn't know much about my exes, we just never talked about past relationships further than “I’ve had 3 exes”

During the dance I couldn't help but only focus on the fact that she is up there on the stage. I know my wife was the one in charge for the music for the day. She never told me what she booked, nor I ever asked about what it is. I asked her what made her choose that band. She said she went through an entertainment agency, saw the ex’s portfolio which was good and within budget and booked.

I told her the singer is my ex from high school and that I'm not comfortable with her performing. She said that's an odd coincidence and told me “Why is this an issue, it happened long ago?""  
I told her yes but I’m weirded out by it. My wife then said it's just music and not to make that much of a big deal since the band is doing a good job. I told her I want to talk with the band.

My ex recognized me and she was being very professional about it. She said she doesn't know it's going to be my wedding and only knew when she got into the venue for prep and saw some other mutual friends. I told her to finish up in the next 30 minutes and to leave. She looked shocked and so does her band members. I reassured them it's not because of the performance. One of the band members said even though they were being asked to leave early, since they already rocked up and this is a change of mind on the day, there will be no refunds. I told them I won't be pursuing a refund,.

Told my wife that the band is leaving and she was livid. Kept asking me why it's such a big deal because of an ex and asked me if I still had feelings for her. I said no that's absurd, but I felt uncomfortable that I was reminded of my past relationship at the worst possible time. She told me I am wasting her money .I told her we could get another DJ that we can get on the spot with the help of the venue in which I will fully pay for. She told me that's just another waste of money because ""my feelings are too fragile and that I can't see the bigger picture""

After the band left, I went straight to the venue manager to sort things out…long story short shit got sorted… DJ did a good job, the guests seemed to have a good time and didn’t notice it but my wife was NOT enjoying it at all. After everything was over she went straight to bed at the hotel.

When Amy’s father died she inherited all of his money, house, cars, and other things. Growing up she had a perfect life, getting whatever she wanted whenever she wanted it, while mine life was hell. I won’t go too deep into it but just give you the idea.

	When I was 12 my mom and two brothers died in a car accident. When I was 13 my father died in a freak machinery accident. I grew up in the system because there wasn’t anyone to care for me. I saw some horrible stuff and I was badly abused. At 17 I finally found two great people that adopted me, and I stayed with them and their son who I now call my brother. I joined the army at 19, got sent out after boot camp and got a promotion once the government saw how good I was with a gun. I became a sniper when I was almost 21 and I got on the bad side of a Russian gang. I laid low in Germany for a while, and I met my husband, Peter, who was a police officer there. We got married and started to try to have kids when the gang situation calmed down, but we had two miscarriages instead. Finally I got pregnant but when the baby was three months old Peter died in the field. I moved back to my country and raised my son with the little money I had. When I was 25 I got onto some drugs and became an alcoholic and often brought men home. At 26 my ma talked some sense into me and I went through withdrawal and became a better mom. I finally have a stable job and my son and I are doing well.

	About a month ago I was visiting Amy after her dad died. I brought food, hand knitted blankets that I had made and my son even went with me to the store to pick out a few toys for Amy’s son who is the same age. We showed up to her house and her butler brought us to the living room. Amy walked in and gave me a strange look. I asked her if she was okay and then she started crying. She kept saying “how could you ask me that? My daddy just died!” I didn’t know what to say because she was getting more angry and sad by the minute, so I told my son to go play with Amy’s boy while I talked to Amy. She was still crying and told me that I was a horrible person. I didn’t know what I did and where this came from, so I politely asked her what I did. She got even angrier and told me that I had no idea what she was going through and that I never would. She said that I was being so inconsiderate and told me that she had a harder life than me.

However, a few other classmates said that they had no idea I was “talking” and assumed another student had been loud in another way, like with their bag. I understand that mouthing words to my friends could’ve been distracting but only three students were still working on the test. I’m not sure if I had offended her in some other way or if i have done something else to her to invoke such a hateful reaction from her.",1.0,0.08755973,0,0
89,1eu9l8v,AITA for being the reason why my brother has stopped showering,"I (16F) live with my only brother (13M) and our parents. My brother has never been the most clean person, and while his bedroom is very neat and organized, he constantly leaves his trash and toys throughout our family’s kitchen and living room. There are almost always Legos covering the floor and furniture, despite having a whole Lego studio set up in our basement for him. The mess is extremely aggravating to me as I already have pretty bad anxiety. It is annoying because I am the only person who it bothers so I am the only person left to pick it up. 

Last week, my brother announced to me that he was going to start showering in my shower. For context, we have two showers in our house, one in my parent’s bedroom’s bathroom and one in the only other bathroom, which I currently have been the only one using for the past year. The whole family used to only use the shower in our parents bathroom because it is much bigger and nicer, however last year I cleaned up the other shower and bought shelves for it, in order for me to start using it as my shower. While is sounds stupid, this is the only place I have to myself (besides my room), that is not covered with my brother’s junk, I actually take care of it and clean it every week. Also I have a decent sized collection of body washes, that I have bought with my own money from my job. When I heard that he wanted to start using this space, I felt a little upset, as this shower is pretty important to me (yes I know it sounds stupid). My parents sided with me after telling them, as they said that he can keep using the shower in their bathroom that he has been for the past 5 or 6 years. Now he hasn’t showered for the past few days and I am starting to feel bad. However I just want one space to myself, since he gets to trash our entire house with his large Lego collection and toys. And I simply don’t have time to have more to clean up since I play two sports, go to school and work, and he doesn’t ever feel obligated to clean despite not really doing anything besides going to school, playing with Legos and watching tv.

91,1eu9gt8,AITA for telling my mom how I really feel?,"Throwaway account.

I am 29 years old female in college and I live with my mom and one of my sisters. Some cousins came to our country for a few weeks. Today my mom and I took these cousins out for the entire day. We had a nice time going to various places and created nice memories. 

However our last stop was at a mall and we went to the food court at the mall. My mom and the cousins went to sit at a table in the food court to make sure we got a table, while I went to grab a coffee further down in this food court. No one else wanted coffee at this time. When I returned to the table, my mom told me to take the cousins deeper in the food court and buy them any food that they wanted. I told them I wanted Chinese food for myself. My mom initially said she wanted Chinese food too but then she said not to get anything for her because she wasn’t entirely sure what food she wanted. So me obeying her instructions, I did not get her any food and instead got my own Chinese food and the cousins got their food that we paid for. 

Once I came back to the table where my mom was sitting, she said: “where’s my food?” And I said to her: “you told me to wait because you weren’t sure what food you wanted to get.” My mom was getting upset at me and giving me an attitude, that I did not bring her food. While I was trying to say this, she kept trying to brush me off like as if she didn’t want to hear what I was saying. All of this happened in front of the cousins, and I was so hurt and humiliated. Then my mom went to get her plate of food from the same Chinese place I got mine from. One of the cousins looked at me funny and said: “why didn’t you just get your mom food…is it because it’s too expensive? You really should have gotten her food.” But her tone was like I had done something wrong. I explained that my mom wasn’t sure what she wanted. 

When my mom came back she saw that I had a long face because I was feeling really triggered and I was trying to hold back my tears. Throughout the rest of the time in the mall my mom kept trying to talk to me about what happened and saying that I’m taking it too deep and that I’m ruining her night and that I always have to start something which I don’t. I kept telling her I didn’t want to talk right then and there but she kept insisting to talk. 

When we dropped the cousins off where they are staying my mom was yelling at me and swearing with the f word and I told her I didn’t want to hear anything. Later when we got home I started packing my things and told her I’m done and that I’ll be out of her house this week. She started screaming at me saying f you and how she never threw me out of her house etc and how she wants to sell her house. I am thinking to go to my dad’s house as they are divorced from each other, but he can be rude at times too.

92,1eu9g5a,AITA for laughing at my sister's ignorant question?,"My sister (F37) and I (F33) are quite close in many ways but also fight a lot. We've been making active steps to lesson the tension between us and generally be more civil to each other. When we do fight things can get heated but we don't often call each other rude names and we try to avoid fighting in front of others.

Also because it's relevant, neither of us are at all sporty or interest in sports. I did play soccer as a kid but I'm not a soccer fan.

Tonight we were both at dinner at our parents' (in their 70s) house. My sister told me she was going to eat pizza there and told me to join. We were discussing silly things like the olympics at the dinner table. As far as I know all was well and I hadn't felt any tension during the evening or over the meal. My mom was drunk (rare for her), and the atmosphere seemed light. 

My sister asked the table ""there aren't professional soccer leagues outside of the world cup and Olympics, though, right?"". I found this question quite funny because even though I'm not an active fan, I do know that soccer is the most popular sport in the world and that there are many leagues all over the world, including here in the U.S. So I guffawed rather loudly. I was honestly just quite shocked and found it funny. 

After like one or two seconds of my laughter, my sister looked me straight in the eyes and said very  angrily, 'dont be a bitch.' And then proceeded to keep talking to my parents about soccer leagues. 

I was rather flabbergasted at the level of vitriol in her tone and voice and the way her anger seemed to come out of nowhere. I was feeling very taken aback and sat quietly for like 2 minutes until my mom started trying to talk to me and I said ""I think I have to leave. I don't want to be called a bitch at the dinner table."" I was somewhat expecting for my sister to apologize for escalating things so quickly but she just doubled down and said ""then don't act like a bitch,"" again really angrily. As I stood up I said, ""I just laughed cause I'm thought it was funny"" and she kept angrily arguing.  So I cleared my plate, collected my stuff, and left the house. I did say ""fuck you"" on the way out I must admit which I feel silly and immature for doing.

My dad said 'bye' but other than that, my parents said nothing. I went and did a little chore in the yard for my mom and left. I know I was being a little petulant to storm off like that, so I texted my mom an apology for not helping with the dishes. 

I know that I was probably a little rude for laughing so loudly, but jumping right to name calling in front of our elderly parents just felt so outsized for the situation, right?

93,1eu99fp,AITA for talking bad about my niece?,"This is my first Reddit post so bear with me, I need someone to tell me if I’m the asshole.

I (26M) was at my sister’s (32F) house earlier today, and she has a daughter (10F) who is the niece in question. My sister and I were hanging out and drinking, and my sister started ranting about how she got a call from another mom, who is the mom of one of her daughter’s friends, about how my niece told the other girl that she needs to wear makeup if she wants people to like her, and essentially called her ugly. Naturally the girl’s mom was upset about this, and called my sister. My sister was saying she talked to her daughter and told her that isn’t an okay thing to say, and asked what I thought about the situation which is where I may be the asshole.

By that point I was pretty drunk, and told my sister straight up that her daughter is a b*tch, and that she should let her know that. I know I had too much to drink because I then started talking about how I’ve never liked my niece and that I don’t know what went wrong with her, because my sister herself is a great person. 

Well my sister got incredibly offended at that and asked what the hell is wrong with me to talk about a child, especially her child like that, and I should’ve apologized right then but for some reason I doubled down and told her I was just being honest and that I know she must feel the same. At that point she told me to leave and stormed back inside without saying anything else, and I didn’t feel like dealing with the situation right then so I called an Uber and texted my sister to let her know I’d be picking up my car tomorrow. 

I know I might’ve been out of line with what I said, but this isn’t the first time my niece has said something mean to another kid, and my sister confides in me every time and I guess I reached a breaking point, and it wasn’t helpful that I was drinking as well. I’m planning to apologize when I pick up my car, because I don’t want to try to talk through it over the phone and I’m not sure my sister would answer anyways, as she hasn’t even answered my first text.

I’m really busy with work and currently am scheduled 7 days a week so there we had a conversation about which days work best for both of us. I agreed to the price to which I followed up trying to confirm a day in the evening closer to my upcoming work event. She had stopped responding so I had messaged her asking if everything was okay and if it was alright for me to come in to the salon and pay for my booking and potentially get an in person consultation just for peace of mind.

 A few days went by and I called because I figured maybe she didn’t see the IG notification and then messaged me saying “like I stated on my Instagram multiple times I was going to be out of the salon this week and getting back to messages when I was able to. Moving forward I don't think I am the best fit to do your hair. Thank you” I apologized for not seeing the post because I don’t follow her and she blocked me. 

When I tried to write to the salon about this they said “Needless to say it was in good judgment we didn't offer you an appointment. After messaging every social media account we have (multiple times) offered you an appointment. At which point you changed your mind. Another appointment time was offered. You didn't respond. then notified you she would be on vacation and you continued to message AND Instagram call her multiple times.

95,1eu977g,AITA for having a meltdown over an icepack? ,"A couple years ago I hurt my knee really badly and when I went to physical therapy over it, I fell in love with this ice pack. I bought this ice pack, and it was no cheap item—I’m talking about 40/50 bucks for a large ice pack that can comfortably wrap around a knee. 

Anyways, I don’t use it all the time but I always keep it in the freezer just in case. A couple months ago my roommate hurt her knee, and, knowing how good the ice pack felt, I told her she could use it as long as she puts it back. 

Surprise surprise, I always have to put it back. Literally every single time. But she’s my friend, so I don’t want her in pain. Make a long story short, I fell at work and busted my ankle pretty badly and I just kind of lost it on her when I came home and found out it was in her room, again, completely thawed out, again. She told me to use frozen vegetables.

I started crying and had a bit of a meltdown, and I yelled at her for being selfish, and inconsiderate enough to pull my icepack out the freezer all the time without ever putting it back. I can admit that I probably over reacted, but I was in so much pain and literally the only thing she can say is use frozen vegetables? Like, I want to use the fucking 40 dollar ice pack I brought to wrap around my ankle, not a fucking tiny pack of vegetables that don’t even work. 

She started crying and went to her room, then her friends started blowing up my phone and calling me ableist and shit for…idk, holding an adult accountable for their actions?? She’s not chronically ill, her knee hurts sometimes but she literally walks fine without any kind of aid, so I have no idea why accusing me of ableism is even in the picture. 

But I do feel like shit for reacting so harshly. AITA?

UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your comments. I really do appreciate your input and agree she will not use my ice pack anymore. I’ve blocked her friends and it’s no skin off my nose—they can talk shit if they want to, they’re not my friends. 

My roommate left for work early this morning, while I was sleeping and resting my ankle. I tried to speak to her when she returned home, but she walked right past me, so. Pretty sure that friendship is over, and tbh I’m not really feeling all that bad about it anymore. I made a mistake in allowing the behavior to persist when she showed me she would not do better despite many promises to. I will take this lesson to not let people walk over me and my boundaries when it comes to my detriment. 

The well wishes for my health really made me feel better, so thank you guys for that. That’s all I have to say about it now 🫡 hopefully we can ignore each other until the lease is up in a couple months, I think that would be most peaceful.

Like, I want to use the fucking 40 dollar ice pack I brought to wrap around my ankle, not a fucking tiny pack of vegetables that don’t even work. 

She started crying and went to her room, then her friends started blowing up my phone and calling me ableist and shit for…idk, holding an adult accountable for their actions?? She’s not chronically ill, her knee hurts sometimes but she literally walks fine without any kind of aid, so I have no idea why accusing me of ableism is even in the picture. 

But I do feel like shit for reacting so harshly. AITA?

UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your comments. I really do appreciate your input and agree she will not use my ice pack anymore. I’ve blocked her friends and it’s no skin off my nose—they can talk shit if they want to, they’re not my friends. 

My roommate left for work early this morning, while I was sleeping and resting my ankle. I tried to speak to her when she returned home, but she walked right past me, so. Pretty sure that friendship is over, and tbh I’m not really feeling all that bad about it anymore. I made a mistake in allowing the behavior to persist when she showed me she would not do better despite many promises to. I will take this lesson to not let people walk over me and my boundaries when it comes to my detriment. 

The well wishes for my health really made me feel better, so thank you guys for that. That’s all I have to say about it now 🫡 hopefully we can ignore each other until the lease is up in a couple months, I think that would be most peaceful. ",0.0,0.2958247,0,1
96,1eu92dr,AITA for acting distant towards an old acquaintance ,"So I had a manager years ago who I had a crush on. He was super hot but he never really worked the nerve to properly converse with me. We’d just look at each other from a distance. I sort of rejected an offer to be alone with him not because I didn’t like him but because I simply was too nervous.

After wards, I ended up losing that job and when I got an interview with him, he was very cold. He told me I had no experience and honestly it hurt my feelings. Despite everything, I made things light and made the best of situation. We ended up smiling and laughing but he didn’t gave me the job. I really didn’t have the experience.

I’ve been seeing him around and I feel a bit distant. I don’t want to hold a grudge but I do feel like I saw a side of him that is worth evaluating. People can change but I don’t like being the nice person all the time. 

I can tell he wants to talk to me and is looking for an acknowledgment from me. Yet I feel like if he really wanted to he could just say hello first. Am I the asshole for acting distant?

97,1eu8xks,AITA for dropping a friend for sharing her opinion,"I (17) and my friend (15) have recently dropped a friend (also 15) due to a comment she made about a minority (she's also said some other awful things behind our backs). We'll call my friend Becky and our now ex-friend Crystal.

To give some background, Crystal and I were best friends for 2 years before things went a bit south. We spent weekends together since we attended different schools (Becky and I are at a public school, while Crystal goes to a religious school).
During the Christmas time Crystal and I had a falling out because of an argument, we were still friends but we didn't talk as much. 

All three of us, Becky, Crystal, and I, attended the same after-school activity, which is how we all know each other. Over the past year, Crystal's behavior began to change, since being in high school, (we live in a majority white town and Christian schools in our area often have students with views that show that) Crystal became very obsessed with becoming popular. 

Our after school activity holds a year end get together. Becky, Crystal, a friend from Crystals school and I decided to go to a close by store, (something we do very often to pass the time). Things took a turn when Crystal picked up a bottle of rubbing alcohol and made a claim that Indigenous people drink it to get drunk because, later in her words over text, ""their systems aren't accustomed to it because it hasn't been their DNA for hundreds of years"". Becky, whose grandfather is Native, corrected Crystal, but she pushed off Becky, saying it was on her own experiences with Native family (Crystal has French family). Becky and I were bothered by this and ended up leaving the store when Crystal and her friend walked away laughing.

We returned to the get together and sat in a corner. A couple of people, (we'll call one Abby and the other Daisy) joined us and asked what happened. Abby had an uneasy feeling about Crystal but didn’t know her well. Daisy, a former close friend of Crystal’s, said similar concerning behaviors at school, like how Crystal would avoid Daisy due to her being known as a “weird kid”. 
Becky had also mentioned that during morning chats before Crystal's bus came, Crystal had called me a ""p*do"" because I have younger friends. I later learned Crystal had also shared private details from our December argument with Becky.

Becky and I decided to cut ties with Crystal but stayed kindly. For a bit we felt we were in the right, but now we’re conflicted. We share the same after-school activity and worry about being questioned by our leaders. We also have a mutual friend who won't share her opinion and it makes Becky and I wonder like we're in the wrong.

tl;dr 

I suffer from constant migraines and was coming off a medication whose withdrawals left me dizzy, nauseous, and lying in bed in darkness for a few days. I blew up over a lightbulb and instantly regretted it, deleted the message, and apologized, acknowledging it wasn’t her fault. I order a bulb and try to move past it. Hours later we’re still arguing about the lightbulb. I’m still in pain and desperate to stop the argument, no longer sorry because she refuses to acknowledge said pain or (worse) she does acknowledge it and chooses to keep going anyway, and I tell her she can’t let things go.  


I’m upset because: she refuses to acknowledge, or DOES acknowledge (but doesn’t say) that I am in physical pain and the more we talk and argue the worse my migraine gets.

She’s upset because: She can’t understand my reasoning or why I did/said those things. There’s “no logic or reasoning,” and she “can’t make it make sense.”



Some background.  


She is currently in a very stressful temporary living situation. Her roommate's mom was going to be visiting and she had nowhere to stay for 8 days. I offered to make the 3 hour drive (1.5hr each way),  load all her things up, and bring her back to stay with me the whole time. Keep in mind I do not have my own place. I live with my parents and siblings so I have to ask their permission first.

I have been suffering from near daily migraines, and loss of control/spasms on the left part of my face. I recently started botox to relax the muscles and reduce the tension and facial spasms as well as a medication to try to manage the migraines. 2 months into the medication I realized that the side effects were causing way more harm than good and chose to quit. The withdrawals over the next 2 weeks had me nauseous, dizzy, only able to stand and walk for short periods of time along with… daily migraines, leaving me in bed and in the dark for most of the time.

The day before I’m supposed to go pick her up we’re talking and I give her an update on how I’m doing (not the best), and I remember that I need to order a new lightbulb for the bathroom. My current one takes 5 minutes to turn on and I don’t want her peeing in the dark or with the door open like my caveman ass has been doing. My bathroom uses an older fluorescent that takes a while to warm up and turn on, is loud and pops/hums, and is constantly having to be replaced. I thought I’d finally change to a different, more modern led, but apparently that’s not always as simple as just “plug it in.”

I was trying to do research on how to make it work and not blow out the bulb 10 minutes into installing it, but this was getting more and more difficult to do as I continued to stare at the surface of the sun that was my phone screen at the time.

It got to the point where I wrote in all caps “I DON’T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FUCKING LIGHT BULB RIGHT NOW.” I immediately regretted it, deleted the message instantly (but apparently not fast enough), and tried apologizing, but the damage was done. 



I know that my responses, especially at the beginning, are short, jump around, difficult to follow, and no normal person would have blown up over something so small in the first place.

I get that. I understand that. I was definitely the asshole there and can’t/won’t argue because I completely agree. I shouldn’t have been responding like that and there was clearly something going on. In my desperation to make everything stop and just move on I said things I regretted and that’s 100% on me and in no way any fault of hers. At the time I felt like I had a needle being pushed in between my eyes and it only got worse the longer I stared at my screen wondering what a ballast modification for a fluorescent housing for led conversion was. I’d hoped she could sympathize with that, and kept trying to express my pain and discomfort and my need to stop because I couldn’t handle it. Instead we went at it for another 4 hours because she could not figure out why I was acting that way.

101,1eu8azh,AITA For calling my friend's pets weird?,"Throwaway account since I know some people in this story use Reddit

So, a few months ago I met a girl I'll call Mary (19f) through my younger sister. We all go to the same college. I got on with her pretty well and since we have similar classes it became not that unusual for us to go to each other's places to grab things or just talk for a bit about our work.

The third time I went over I got curious and asked what she used a certain room for (she lives by herself in a two bedroom apartment) and she said it was for her animals. I thought she meant something typical, but when I asked she said it was for her snake and tarantula. You heard me, tarantula.

I asked why in the world she would own a tarantula (and why it would need it's own room) and she said it was because her mother loved all kinds of spiders and she thought it would be nice to have something in her memory. I was still extremely weirded out but I figured if it meant something to her then I wouldn't say anything about it

Except after that she started being weird about it. And I mean WEIRD. She would send me pictures of her snake wearing little hats and when I came over sometimes she would just have it around her neck when she answered the door, she even gave it a cutesy little name to ""make people less scared"" as if that's how it works (it's named Penny if you're wondering)

Every once in a while I would make jokes about how odd it was or how I would never own those animals or why she couldn't just own something normal like a dog. I always meant it in good fun but usually the most I got out of her was an unenthusuastic chuckle or an eye-roll

When I went over yesterday to get a paper I forgot at her place, she came to the door and warned me that she accidentally left the lid of the tarantulas cage open while she was getting it water and that it escaped and she's been digging around the room for it. I jokingly said ""careful, if that thing sneaks up on me I might just step on it""

She got annoyed and told me to stop saying shit like that about her pets and that she was really sick of me talking like that. I was confused since I was obviously joking but I could tell she was serious

Here's where I might be the asshole, I said that I was just joking and if she couldn't handle people disliking her creatures then she shouldn't have them, and not everyone needs to conform to how she lives, especially when she owns such uncomfortable animals

She closed the door on me right there and didn't answer when I tried to call her later so I know she's definitely mad at me. I kind of regret saying it but I wasn't completely wrong, I just think I was kind of an ass about it

102,1eu7tv2,AITA for uninviting my friend to my birthday party? ,"I told my friend not to come to my birthday party, and I think that was rude in hindsight. 

I (20F) uninvited my friend (23F) to my birthday party today. I wanted to have a small get together and not have it be an actual party. The party got much bigger than I wanted it too and I wanted to uninvite her. 

For context, we work together, which is how we became friends, but sometimes she really does not have my back at work and lets me down. It's really frustrating and I think I've built up some resentment towards her for it. At the same time, she has had my back outside of work before, too. I once cried to her in her bedroom. 

I'm kind of second-guessing my choice to uninvite her and can't really think of a way out of this. Now, I feel like shit, but what can I do? ""Hey I actually take it back and I'll let you come to my birthday party."" Like what the hell? 

Edit: I think I am being a people pleaser because when people have accidentally brought up my party in front of others, I automatically turn it into an invite because I'm don't want to tell them I didn't invite them. 

I like this friend a lot. We've been friends for a few years, and I have a good time with her. She just also coincidentally can be flaky at work or do the bare minimum. This frustrates me even though it's unrelated to our friendship, and I have a hard time understanding the different dynamics in friendship versus in the workplace.

I told my friend not to come to my birthday party, and I think that was rude in hindsight. 

I (20F) uninvited my friend (23F) to my birthday party today. I wanted to have a small get together and not have it be an actual party. The party got much bigger than I wanted it too and I wanted to uninvite her. 

For context, we work together, which is how we became friends, but sometimes she really does not have my back at work and lets me down. It's really frustrating and I think I've built up some resentment towards her for it. At the same time, she has had my back outside of work before, too. I once cried to her in her bedroom. 

I'm kind of second-guessing my choice to uninvite her and can't really think of a way out of this. Now, I feel like shit, but what can I do? ""Hey I actually take it back and I'll let you come to my birthday party."" Like what the hell? 

Edit: I think I am being a people pleaser because when people have accidentally brought up my party in front of others, I automatically turn it into an invite because I'm don't want to tell them I didn't invite them. 

I like this friend a lot. We've been friends for a few years, and I have a good time with her. She just also coincidentally can be flaky at work or do the bare minimum.

103,1eu7pg1,AITA for telling my neighbor to respect my toddlers boundaries?,"My neighbor (59F) saw myself (30F), my son (2M) and my daughter (5F) outside in the front yard today and decided to walk over to chat with the kids. It was mostly small talk with my daughter (Lily) about how big she is and her preschool. 

My neighbor (Danielle) then turned her attention to my son (Jackson) who was running care free in circles. She looked at him and say “AREN’T YOU HUGE, I need to pick you up” and started walking towards him. He ran away, as toddlers do with people they aren’t super familiar with. Normally this is the part where people make a joke about him running away from them and they move on. She did not move on. She kept trying to “corner” him for lack of a better term. Which when she did, he would shake his head no, wave, and say “bye”. He doesn’t speak much but I feel like that is clear enough. 

I politely let her know that he doesn’t seem to want to be picked up right now. I made sure to make it seem lighthearted by mentioning that he probably is focused on playing with his sister. I thought this would be the end of our interaction but she continued to chase him and try and pick him up. Now when I saw chase him, I don’t mean the cute little “I’m going to get you peekaboo” type play run. She was booking it as fast as her legs would let her to keep up with him. 

Now here is where I might be the AH. I said “Danielle, I think he is wanting you to respect his space so he can go back to playing” and she said “he is a baby and doesn’t get a choice”. My tone was a lot more stern when I said “both of my children are allowed to set boundaries and those boundaries will be respected or you will need to hop back over to your yard”. 

I don’t have a great word for how she was looking at me but bewildered and appalled will have to work for now. She mumbled something about “millennial parents and disrespectful kids” and then walked back to her house.

A little background - We are not very close we this neighbor. We wave when we see each other, we exchange Christmas cards, and have the occasional “how’s the family” talk. She is a nice enough lady but the drama with her children and grandchildren causes us to avoid delving into any further contact. Her daughter and son are in their late 30s and live in her home currently. They are obnoxious when they drink to say the least. They usually end up fighting one another or inviting friends over to fight with leading to the police being there quite often. We avoid them as much as possible because I find their behavior triggering and don’t want my children exposed to it. Even with that being said - they’ve rang our doorbell in the middle of the night and come and tried to talk to my kids when they can barely form a thought. It’s just kind of chaotic and frustrating so we avoid when we can.

104,1eu7g6g,AITA for calling out my son's vice principal for trying to steal his sitter?,"We've had the same sitter (David) for four years. Right now he's mostly helping us with our 8yo twins but occasionally with our 12yo since he's older. All the parents and kids in our sons grade know our sitter because he's probably supervised playdates with them or subbed for other sitters.

Recently I found out that the principal (Mr G) offered David a job working at the school. He said that he would start him at the top wage and would get benefits. David declined. I told David that he probably declined because the work hours are the same as the school hours and he wasn't going to quit his day job over it.

He said actually he declined because Mr. G wanted him to also work after school hours too. I said doesn't he know that you're working for us at those times? He said he did and that's when Mr G offered to start him on the highest wage.

I was pissed. I spoke to Mr G and asked why would he poach our sitter for his school? He'd basically leave us without a sitter. That's fucked up. Mr G said he had nothing to apologize for and wanted David to work for the school. I asked what would we do if we found ourselves out of a sitter. He said ""hire another."" I asked why OUR sitter and he said there were only two male staff including himself and he wanted another. Now things are very odd between us. I think he thought our sitter would quit.

105,1eu7c2g,AITA for telling my friend he's being a bad sport?,"**TLDR: My friend can't just say ""good game"" after we play and instead calls me cheap and says he isn't having fun, so I told him off politely, saying he's a bad sport. Am I the asshole? Please see below for more details.**

I won't say which game. I'm 35 year old dude, my friend is slightly younger. We play a particular game together quite often. I actually introduced it to him.

At first, I was very dominant over him. He, being a little OCD and naturally competitive, got obsessed with the game, and over the course of months (actually years really), he became VERY, VERY, VERY good at it. I actually stopped winning AT ALL for quite some time.

Getting tired of losing, I began putting some effort at getting better at said game. Fast forward a long time (we've been doing it a long time lol): we're at a point now where I actually can win a few times, but he probably wins about 70% of the time. But his wins are often very close games. So, I don't do too badly really. It doesn't bother me. He's still better than me but I can hang.

He has this weird sense of ""honor"" about the game. As in, he pulls off very complicated chains of moves and is very crafty and tricky, and has insanely good timing and and spatial awareness. He's actually kind of gifted honestly. I do not share his traits. I tend to play a much more simplistic style. The one thing I do have that keeps me in the game is that I do have pretty good reflexes, so I can sometimes take advantage of brief openings, which gets me my few wins.

It bothers him quite a lot that he could lose AT ALL to my play style. He doesn't get mad or anything, or rages, but will essentially say ""I can't STAND that I lose to such a vanilla strategy, and the way you play is just cheap and bullshit and broken. I'll never give you any credit. Also it's not fun playing against you, but I have to for the challenge.""

I usually end our sessions with admitting he's the better player, but I usually express to him that I felt pretty good about how I did. Neither of us get very ""ragey"" in our sessions, I should add. 

Recently after a session, something in me snapped, and I told him that he was a bad sportsman, and that I didn't really appreciate his insulting me and being unable to accept that for that one moment, he was outplayed. I even told him that I was genuinely having fun despite losing the majority of matches. He doubled down, saying it wasn't fun and that it pisses him off (how I play), but that he'd always welcome playing me as a challenge.

He proposed we parted our ways on this game, as in we are still friends, but maybe we don't play this game anymore. I told him I thought that was really sad...it's fun for me. I told him I'd think about it.

So...am I the asshole? Should I just ignore him and keep playing because I like our sessions?

I (25f) and getting married to (26m) John. He is my high school sweetheart, though we have not been together the whole time since high school we have remained friends since we first met.

My sister Julie (21f) has a history of short flings with girlfriends. She always has a new person she is talking to. Her recent relationship is with Ann (21f). They have been together for a a few months, but are still new in their relationship.

We are having a family only wedding. The exception to this is my bridesmaid who has been in my life since we were both 3 years old. She is like a sister to me and is bringing her wife. My Fiancé also has a friend he has known for years who is coming who is also considered family.

Ann is not someone I consider family, she is just Julie’s newest girlfriend to me. Julie was aware this is a family only wedding. She decided to ask me in front of several family members if Ann is coming to the wedding. I said no, it’s for family only. My mom tried to jump to her defense but a look from me shut her down. Julie made a stink and cause a fight, causing several family members to gang up on me. 

I don’t want to be rude but I don’t like Ann a lot. She’s still a stranger to me and I don’t think, especially now that my sister thinks her wants are more important than mine on my wedding, that I should invite her.

My parents are divorced and do not talk to each other. Each has separately pulled me aside to ask me to reconsider. Their partners, my step mom and step dad agree with me. My fiancé is tired of hearing my family pester me but is starting to lean towards the “this is ridiculous that you don’t want her here so much you’re going to keep fighting them about this.” He does not like confrontation and is staying out of this but I can tell he is getting annoyed.

109,1eu6ooc,AITA for no longer sending my homeless brother money?,"I (26F) have been on bad terms with my brother (30M) since I was 11. During my childhood, he caused distress in the house, making holes in walls, keeping me awake with loud outbursts, and breaking my things. He did the same to my mom. My sister, mom, and I were very afraid of him. CPS interviewed us several times, and there were months when my siblings and I lived with my grandma. Despite this, therapists and cops believed my brother's claim that my dad was responsible for everything. The rest of the family and the cops didn't ask me about it. The court-ordered therapist said to me “it’s okay to tell the truth,. You don’t have to protect your mom and dad”.

This lasted for 2-3 years. On my 11th birthday (2013), my brother (then 15) went to an inpatient mental hospital for two weeks, then lived with my Aunt, who eventually kicked him out, and later with my grandma. When I was about 15/16, I tried to reconnect with him. We had a good time at the movies but went back to not talking much.

My grandma passed away in 2020. Due to my brother dropping out of high school and not working while living with her, my aunt sold the house, leaving him homeless. He briefly stayed with my parents but had to get his GED, a job, or attend community college/trade school to stay. He refused, so my parents paid 6 months’ rent for a studio near his friends and then cut him off. Since then, he has been in and out of motels, temporary housing, or jail and was addicted to heroin and meth from 2015/2016 to 2022.
Since becoming homeless, he’s been asking me and my mom for money, usually monthly and sometimes weekly, especially in winter. We send him money depending on our finances and how recently we've sent it. I’ve given him ~6k in the last 2 years, but he’s repaid me only once, for $100.

I’m considering changing my number or deleting my Facebook to stop him from reaching out for money. The only time we hear from him is when he needs money, though we don’t check in with him either. Despite everything, he’s still my brother, and I feel guilty when I can’t help him.

So Reddit, would I be the asshole if I stop financially supporting my brother even though he only asks once a month?

TLDR: My brother is homeless and asks for money monthly. Our relationship is strained due to his past abuse. I’m considering ending financial support.

111,1eu60do,AITA for telling my son I won't lie for him even though he's not wrong?,"I have a 17yo so named Jared and he has an 8yo half brother named Tyler. Jared is extremely protective of Tyler. Tyler lives with his maternal uncle although Tyler does spend occasional weekends and whatnot because his uncle works at a hospital. Our house is basically his second home and my wife loves to spoil him with clothes. 

On Monday Tyler was admitted to the ER because he couldn't breathe. He had a collapsed lung and no one knows why. Jared freaked out and demanded to go to the hospital to see him. Uncle Tim said no. Tyler is fine and needs rest. He said Jared could FaceTime Tyler when he feels better. 

Tyler was released from the hospital on Wednesday and Jared asked to see him. Uncle Tim said no. Tyler needs rest. Well on Thursday night, Jared snuck over to their house and Tyler let him in through the window. Uncle Tim found out because Jared left his sunglasses.

Jared denied being there and denied the sunglasses were his. Uncle Tim said that's good because he'd ban Jared from coming over for the rest of the month if he came over without permission and after being told no.

Uncle Tim asked me if Jared was home the night in question. Tyler held firm he wasn't there. Tim said let's be respectful adults. I checked Jared's 365 history and indeed he was at their house.

I told Tim that he's an asshole for denying Jared from seeing his brother knowing how he is with him. He could had been more flexible and he screwed the situation up. But yes, Jared was there.

So now Jared is banned from coming over for a month and won't be able to see his brother at least for another week. Everyone is pissed at me. My son for not lying and Tim for ""kicking him while he was down."" 

I told my son that I wasn't going to help him dig himself into a deeper hole by lying and I told Tim that I said those things to him because he needed to hear it.

I chose to live with my parents bc they don’t charge me—my parents also don’t pay rent or a mortgage, and never have. They don’t pay ANY bills other than internet, and both work and make great money especially bc they don’t pay bills.

I used to go hungry growing up bc my parents would never go grocery shopping, and still never do. The closest thing is that my dad will buy sandwich ham and cheese, and then my mom will buy chicken and rice. My parents only buy the cheapest things they can find. I grew up eating ramen noodles, despite us never being in a spot to have to do that. I hate using what my parents buy and their cooking, so I go grocery shopping for myself—I’m very big into organic food and eating healthy, so I spend more where it matters. I have high caloric needs bc of my height and activity, so it can hurt my wallet, especially as I don’t make much, but I struggle to get through 3 meals a day unless it’s something varied so c’est la vie (likely trauma from growing up eating the same thing every day).

I became very upset as I discovered my parents had been eating my food. It wasn’t a single occurrence, but a pattern.

I bought myself a fridge with a lock to keep my groceries in. Every time I cook they’ll say it looks so good and how I should make some for them and I tell them no, because I bought a specific amount of groceries to get myself to a healthy weight and how what I already bought was expensive and I don’t have that much money.

114,1eu5wiz,WIBTA to call my dad out on his behavior? ,"I(39f)have always been a daddy's girl to the point where I didn't see the red flags until my(now)husband(44m)pointed them out. Now I'm not sure if it's better to avoid conflict for my mom's sake or call my dad out on his behavior.

When I was little, my dad always told me how pretty I was, and how men would fight each other to be my husband. Back then, I was petite, blonde and adorable, and grew up believing that a woman's worth was how much attention she got from men.

The older I got, the chubbier I grew, and my hair darkened. This was when the negative comments started from my dad, things like, ""it's too bad you're so fat now. You used to be so pretty, "" or ""it's a good thing you have a life goal that doesn't include a husband because you'll be lucky to find one,"" (I wanted to be a veterinarian and open a cat café). 

I didn't think anything of his comments because I agreed with him. I was nowhere near the ideal beauty standards of the time. I was not skinny, I had to wear padded bras just to get a modicum of a bust, and I was no longer a natural blonde. His comments did wreck my self-esteem for a while, but then I came to terms with it and moved on, accepting I would always be alone because of my looks.

Well, I met my current husband through a mutual friend when I was 28. We dated for 7 years before he proposed because I was unsure and insecure with our relationship. He was so different from my usual taste in men that I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop or for him to show his true colors like all my other bfs had in the past. 

It didn't take me long to noticed that my husband always grew agitated around my dad and would avoid socializing with him. After awhile, he admitted he disliked my dad and would vent about him to the point where it started fights. I told my husband my dad wasn't as bad as he made him sound but, as time went on, and my dad's comments grew worse and more frequent, I realized my husband was right. 

I finally saw my dad for who he really was...a sexist, entitled pervert with a Victorian opinion of women. Now, I can't believe or understand why my mom(60f)has put up with him and his low opinion of women for so long. All she tells me when I ask is ""with the way I look, I will never find another man who treats me as good as your dad,"" which reeks of my dad's influence.

Unlike me and my dad, my mom and I butted heads all through my teen years because we had very different opinions about a lot of things. It took us years to build up a sustainable relationship, and only after I moved out and we got some separation. I really don't want to jeopardize how things are between us. I love my parents and my mom is one of my best friends.

So, my question is, WIBTA if I (or my husband) called my dad out for his sexist behavior? I love my dad, and I don't like stirring up conflict, especially when my mom will get the brunt end of things, but I don't know how much longer I can stay silent.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-17,"WIBTA to call my dad out on his behavior?

My husband often works late but generally he gets home at 4pm. Afterwhich he works on our house because we are renovating. I cook dinner and pick up the house. Then we shower and go to bed, and in the middle of all that we both care for our baby. We are comfortable, but this is America so we work for the weekend. I dont feel like we spend much quality time together during the week and it is my love language. His is physical touch, and acts of service. I do pleantly of his love language making him dinner all the time and our sex life does not suffer either, but him giving me my love language has been a struggle through our relationship. I just want to cuddle and watch a tv show, or play minecraft, or chess. I am an introvert and it is much easier to take care of our baby in our home where we have everything we need. Needless to say I am not one for going out. Well... every friday night for the last 6 months he goes to play volleyball with his family, and I mean extended family. Many uncles, aunts, cousins, his sisters, his parents, and listen I think its awesome... once a month. Or maybe if it was just dinner at his moms once a week and it didnt always have to be on the same day.

116,1eu55yn,AITA for making my neighbor’s remove their bird feeder?,"My husband and I rent a house with an attached studio apartment. We rent that apartment to Tim and his girlfriend Jill. We share a courtyard in the front of the house. 
Jill loves birds and immediately after moving in she placed a few hummingbird feeders on their side of the courtyard which we were fine with. 
The problem started when they got a seed feeder. We live in a very wooded area and there are a lot of critters around, mostly rats, mice, chipmunks, squirrels and rabbits.

117,1eu4yib,AITA for letting girls stay at my son’s sleepover?,"My (f42) son (m15) wanted to have a sleepover with a bunch of his friends before school started back up next week. Me and my husband agreed as long as we got all his friends parents phone numbers and that all his friends got permission to come.

My son has a fairly large friend group of maybe eight people and six were coming over, four boys and two girls. When the sleepover came everyone had fun until around 11pm when the first girl left. I assumed that the second girl was going to leave soon as well, but she told me that her mom said that she could stay and I figured I could just set up the guest room and call it a day.

Everything fine until the next morning when I woke up to multiple calls and texts from the girls mother. I called her back and she answered screaming at me saying “how could I let a girl stay with all those boys” and “I should’ve just drove her home when it was getting late” even though that had never been discussed. I reminded her that her daughter lied about having permission but she wouldn’t listen to anything.

Now my husband is saying he felt uncomfortable with her staying the night and the other parents are saying it was a bad call on my part. So AITA?

Edit: Just wanna clear some things up. My son has been close with the girl who stayed the night since 6th grade and they are all going into their sophomore year of high school. This girl has actually stayed over before because she used to get tutored and babysat by my older daughter.

My (f42) son (m15) wanted to have a sleepover with a bunch of his friends before school started back up next week. Me and my husband agreed as long as we got all his friends parents phone numbers and that all his friends got permission to come.

My son has a fairly large friend group of maybe eight people and six were coming over, four boys and two girls. When the sleepover came everyone had fun until around 11pm when the first girl left. I assumed that the second girl was going to leave soon as well, but she told me that her mom said that she could stay and I figured I could just set up the guest room and call it a day.

Everything fine until the next morning when I woke up to multiple calls and texts from the girls mother. I called her back and she answered screaming at me saying “how could I let a girl stay with all those boys” and “I should’ve just drove her home when it was getting late” even though that had never been discussed. I reminded her that her daughter lied about having permission but she wouldn’t listen to anything.

Now my husband is saying he felt uncomfortable with her staying the night and the other parents are saying it was a bad call on my part. So AITA?

Edit: Just wanna clear some things up. My son has been close with the girl who stayed the night since 6th grade and they are all going into their sophomore year of high school. This girl has actually stayed over before because she used to get tutored and babysat by my older daughter.

Dad1 and Mom1 had 2 sons in the 80s, Jack (43) and Donny (40).

In the 90s, my parents (Mom2 and Dad2) has my sister Janice (30), and then later on had my brother Mark (25) and me (21). Around the time I was born, Donny had a daughter, Susan (21).

A few years later, my Mom and Donny's dad (Mom2 and Dad1) got together and had my half sister Emily (17). Donny's dad is significantly older than my mom. 

Sorry for the migraine. Anyway, in 2021 my siblings and I met Donny since he occasionally visited Emily as she was growing up, who we were close to as she is our half sister. We also met his daughter Susan. Since then we all had, I thought, a strictly familial relationship. (We never met Jack as he apparently lives in another country and doesnt keep in touch with anyone)

But earlier this year, Janice dropped the bombshell that her and Donny were engaged. I wish I was joking but apparently they have been dating discretely since after we met him and Susan. At the end of the day I figured we weren't blood related so I guess its none of my business. But oh I wish it ended there.

Yesterday, Janice invited me over to ""discuss something important"". When I got there, Donny, Mark, and Susan were also present. Janice sat me down and told me that Mark and Susan were fucking engaged. 

They wanted to tell me in person with everyone there because they were worried I wouldn't handle it well like how I initially didnt handle Janice and Donny's engagement well. No shit! After confirming that it wasnt a joke, I went off on them. I told Janice that it was sick she was letting her brother marry her step daughter, that it must be illegal or at least SHOULD be. I told her that as if its bad enough she wants to model our family tree after greek mythology, but then slim hades over here wants to marry his niece (for context, Janice is a massive greek mythology nerd and Mark has bleach blonde hair and dresses like a middle schooler who just discovered rap for the first time). 

Susan was crying at this point and said she wanted to ask me to be a bridesmaid, and maybe this is where I was an asshole but I told her like hell I would even show my face at either of their weddings and told her to think about how her future kids will feel when during those family tree assignments kids get in class they have to present a fucking wreath!

Saying that my uncle was not my uncle. I asked my dad and he said it was complicated. People recognized my last name and asked if we were related. In turn I said she was my aunt due to the information given to me above. 

Am I the asshole for saying she’s my aunt ?

127,1eu426u,AITA for telling my girlfriend her sister is acting like a brat and I don’t care that she’s a kid?,"I've been visiting my girlfriends house and her sister (who is 12) has stolen my phone, my keys, my watch, etc. She likes to hide my stuff and gives me clues on where to find it all. My gf and her family seem to find this charming and adorable, but I just find it really annoying when I'm trying to dig my phone out from behind the fridge because she decided to put it there.

Her sister justifies it by saying she deserves my stuff more and I can win it back. I just find it bizarre her parents aren't really doing anything about it.

I talked to my gf about it and said her sister being a brat with stealing all my stuff and hiding it and it is really getting on my nerves. I don't find it funny like they do. I also said I don't like that her parents are so fine with it.

My gf said I was being harsh, she's a kid and she's just ""doing what kids do."" She said she's not being a brat and you can't get mad at a kid for acting like a kid.

I don't get this at all because I wasn't stealing peoples shit when I was a kid. Kids can know how to behave. But I also grew up with Asian parents, who are pretty strict especially when it comes to inappropriate behavior around guests. If I behaved that way with a guest, my parents would be upset immediately.

So I told her the first part and said I don't care if she's a kid, she needs to stop stealing my stuff and give back what she stole.

She said she thinks I'm being unreasonable expecting her sister to act like she's an adult, but she'll talk to her parents but it's ""hard"" to get her to behave because she's so young. But yeah, she doesn't seem happy that I'm annoyed by her sister.

Our parents our divorced and we just started staying at our dads house on the weekends and our moms in the weekdays. Our dads new house is smaller then the one we lived in before they got divorced and so my sister and me have to share a bathroom. 

She has been really mad about me leaving the toilet seat up. This is only our 3rd weekend at our dads house and she has nagged me about leaving the toilet seat up like 10 times. She keeps telling me I'm "" such a jerk "" for leaving the toilet seat up. 

And today she got really mad about it again because she was coming home from her soccer game and I guess had to pee really bad cuz she yelled at me for leaving the toilet seat up again. She said she almost wet her soccer shorts because she had to turn around and put the seat back down herself before she could pee. 


She said I was a complete jerk for leaving the seat up, I told her"" hey I never ask you to put the seat back up for me after you pee so why should I have to put the seat back down for you""? 

She got really mad yelled "" because only jerks leave the toilet seat up you jerk "". 

I didn't think it was a big deal but she is really mad about it.

129,1euvn1l,AITA for talking money,"I and my partner have been together for three years, share a pet, and live separately. today, while we were strolling an local neighborhood with bunches of small businesses, we visited a shop that had secondhand electronics and DVDs. He noticed a game system priced at $280. Last year, I bought him a used system for Christmas from the shop. He had mentioned before that he was considering buying another used game system for my place so he could play when he stayed over. He brought it up again when we left the shop, saying he might purchase it in September for my house.

I responded by saying, “I don’t know… I feel like, and I mean this with no offense, but if you have the $280 to spend on a system for my place, I’d prefer it go towards repaying me for your half ($500) of our trip last spring than on an Xbox for my place. Sorry, I know, awkward, but it’s how I feel.”

Here’s the backstory:
When we planned our trip, I bought the plane tickets and paid for the hotel because I had a credit card. He promised to Venmo me his share once he got paid. However, he was fired from his job due a miscalculation that cost his company money. I ended up covering the entire cost. Afterward, he was devastated and promised to repay me once he found a new job. I was supportive during his unemployment, and he eventually got a better job without debt from his unemployment period.

Understanding that it takes time to recover financially, I didn’t bring up the repayment. Five-six  months later, he’s back to normal with no outstanding debt. I expected him to repay me eventually but I didn’t follow up, thinking he might have forgotten, that I love him, and I felt awkward with the transactional aspect. Although I’m not desperate for the money, I have property taxes going up and I’m going to have to budget to cover the difference. All is fine financially and I’ll cover it, but since he’s living 5 out of seven days with me bills have gone up too and it would help. I have zero resentment either way. I did not want it to be an issue. I love him.

When I told him I’d prefer he use the $280 to pay me back for the trip (he promised to split) instead of buying the Xbox, he responded with a deadpan “Ok.”  10 minutes later, he said he wanted to go home. I asked if something was wrong, and he said I shouldn’t have mentioned the money while he was “just passively talking” about the game system. On the way home, he checked his bank account and said he would pay me in full. I told him I’d be upset if he stretched himself financially to pay me back immediately. He earns $47K, while I earn $55K, and with his bills and rent, it would be tight for him this month with $500 suddenly gone. He then accused me of tracking his spending, which isn’t true, and insisted on repaying me immediately. He became passive-aggressive and gave me the cold shoulder the entire evening. Isolating himself and straight up upset with me.

I’m frustrated by his reaction. I didn’t bring up the issue aggressively or use it as a weapon; I just wanted to be honest. I feel hurt.
