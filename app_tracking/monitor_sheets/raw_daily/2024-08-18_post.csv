0,1ev8b12,AITA for making my bf wear a tie to a black tie event?,"
My boyfriend and I attended my coworker/friend‚Äôs wedding last weekend where dress code was black tie. I let him know a couple weeks in advance and he expressed annoyance stating ‚ÄúI never wear ties‚Ä¶I hate wearing ties‚Äù and I told him I was very honored to be invited to this wedding as she is someone I care for and respect, and I would be embarrassed if he broke the dress code. Fast forward to the wedding, he wears the tie to the ceremony and is angry the entire time. Doesn‚Äôt speak to me and has a terrible look on his face. I cried after the ceremony because I was upset he was acting this way. He said ‚Äúyou care about this wedding than you do my feelings‚Äù we talked it out, had a good time at the reception, however I feel like this week he is still sour about it. It‚Äôs been a week today and I teased him about how the pictures would have turned out better if he had been in dress code. Apparently that was unacceptable because now he is just as upset as he was at the wedding. I genuinely can‚Äôt wrap my head around how he can be this upset about a tie.  AITA?!!!!

Edit: thank you for all your responses. For context, we have been together for almost 3 years (30F, 34M) and this was an isolated event. He really is a good person- very kind, generous, always goes out of his way to make sure I‚Äôm happy and taken care of, etc, which was why I was so taken aback by the whole situation. I wanted to come here to gain some perspective regarding this particular incident. Thank you all for giving me a little peace of mind.

3,1evmoqv,AITA for not picking up my brother‚Äôs shift?,"I (21f) still live with my parents while I am in college, and I currently have 2 part time jobs which I am using to save money to pay for school, textbooks, gas, etc. 

2 months ago, my parents asked me to help my brother (16m) get a job at my workplace, and I agreed. I wrote his resume, got him in contact with managers to set up an interview and his online employee portal, and have helped him fill out all his paperwork for new employees. 

So far he has only been scheduled for 3 shifts, 2 of which were for training. I‚Äôve gotten in touch with managers to communicate for him, and he‚Äôs said he‚Äôs been calling, but other new employees have been hired and scheduled since then while he has not. I‚Äôve reached a point where if I keep interfering it will make him seem like he‚Äôs incompetent on his own. 

This morning, my parents asked me to cover a shift for him later this week since he forgot he had a school event and wouldn‚Äôt be able to work. He‚Äôd apparently known about both work and school for days ahead but said nothing until now. I have school and work that day, but later in the day so technically I could cover his shift. Still, I said no, because I have a lot to do already and quite honestly I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs my responsibility to cover for him just because we‚Äôre related- he needs to figure it out with our managers on his own. 

My parents disagree and I was told they will remember this event in the future if I ever need help. I don‚Äôt think this is fair as I have multiple calendars to keep track of my obligations and do not make it their problem if I fail to meet them (which I very rarely do). All my friends have agreed this isn‚Äôt my job but my parents are adamant that I am morally wrong, even though they won‚Äôt force me to take the shift, they just refuse to hear my side and are treating me as though I am being vindictive and lazy for not inconveniencing myself for him. So, AITA?

Edit: thank you for the confirmation I‚Äôm not crazy. He‚Äôs put in his 2 weeks as he is not yet responsible enough for a job, I will be covering his shifts this week but he‚Äôs essentially my dog until the week is over lol.

4,1evmoex,AITA for getting frustrated with my fiance after a lengthy installation of laundry appliances‚Ä¶,"What started as being a simple installation of a new washer and dryer quickly devolved into numerous visits to Home Depot, other houses for tools etc when we discovered a copper pipe had issues during the removal of previous appliances.

5,1evmkqr,AITA for expecting a full apology from my friend‚Äôs (M20) jealous girlfriend (F21)?,"I've been part of a close-knit friendship group of seven since we were 11, and we've been friends for 10 years now. Recently, my friend, J‚Äôs, girlfriend, S, has started accusing my girlfriend of wanting to sleep with my friend. You have to understand that S is extremely jealous (She once spent an hour and a half arguing with J on a night out after a drunk girl asked if he had any water - it ruined the night and we all eventually had to go home early). S is accusing my girlfriend because she looks through her boyfriend‚Äôs phone, and has seen he has popped up to my girlfriend‚Äôs private story, as well as follows her spam account on instagram (something S herself, and all my friends follow). She‚Äôs saying all my girlfriend does is post slutty, half-naked pictures of herself there (She doesn‚Äôt even post pictures of her in a bikini, so I don‚Äôt know where she‚Äôs getting this from). It‚Äôs all kicked off because one weekend when we were out, J came back from the bar and started arguing with some lad because he thought my girlfriend was flirting with someone while I was sat right next to her. This is simply not true, our mutual friend corroborates my story that my girlfriend was actually in the process of telling him to leave her alone. Even though this has been explained to J and S, S is still saying that my girlfriend was flirting, even though she was across the room. After this altercation, J and S stormed off arguing with each other because S was saying J shouldn‚Äôt have gotten involved and that I should of dealt with the situation (even though me and my girlfriend already had and it was J who started it up again). The rest of us ended up going home because we spent 20 minutes looking for J and S, not knowing they‚Äôd gotten a taxi home. I told my girlfriend to text J and S and tell them to text us back when they got home, as my phone had run out of battery. 

S then called a lunch with two of my friends the next day, telling them my girlfriend was a slut and wanted to cheat on me with J because of the above reasons, but also because she apparently sent three kisses to J, and only two to S. Eventually the truth came out about what‚Äôs actually happened, and everyone in the group agrees that is an insane reason to accuse someone of cheating. J has been avoiding all of us for the last few months, but recently one of my friends got in touch with J and S and is suggesting a sit-down to ‚Äútalk it out‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know if I want to.

6,1evmi5s,AITA for tapping my horn at someone in the gas station?,"This was at a Loves travel plaza where there is plenty of ample parking away from the gas pumps.  I was in my pickup truck, with a boat and trailer attached, which limited me to which gas pumps I could pull into, as the gas station was very busy at this time (around 4 in the afternoon) I pulled up behind a neon green dodge charger, where the lady was pumping gas. I was very clearly parked right in line behind her to get to the pump when she was finished.

 I watched her finish pumping gas, and put her gas cap back, and then shut her drivers side door and turned to go like she was walking into the gas station. I gave the horn a friendly tap-ta-tap and motioned from over the steering wheel that I wanted to pull up to get gas, that I was waiting.

 There were plenty of open parking spaces away from the gas pumps. This woman just instantaneously lost her shit, she started getting all animated, flailing around, by the time I could put my window down and hear what she was actually saying, it was 'mothereffer you can't wait 5 effing minutes etc etc...' I just kind of started laughing, and she got in her car and pulled off. I pulled up and got out, started pumping my gas. This woman drove an entire full circle all the way around the pumps and back just to hang out the window and cuss at me some more. My only response to her as she was driving by hurling more obscenities was ""do you kiss your mother with that funky mouth?"" I definitely said it loud enough for her and everyone else around to hear it. But she was certainly as loud herself. Apparently the whole time this is going on, her husband is standing in front of the entrance to the gas station directly in front of me about 50 yards away or so, and then he yells at me that 'I better watch my effing mouth, thats my wife' to which I replied No, she needs to watch her mouth, I don't care who she is. He starts to get all out of sorts, and I just kept telling him to ""come on over buddy"" if he wanted to take it there. She pulled up and parked nearby where he was standing and proceeds to get out of the car with their maybe 8 or 9 year old kid. I just started laughing and shaking my head, and they got in their snot-green booger-bad-behavior-mobile and drove off. 

But It did later cross my mind - Was I the asshole for tapping the horn at her? It was a friendly horn tap, I didn't lay on the horn or anything, and I politely motioned that I wanted to get gas from over the steering wheel.

 I've always thought it was common courtesy when the gas station is busy, and especially if someone is waiting right behind you, to go ahead and move away from the pumps when you're done getting gas. I mean it's different if there is barely no one at the gas station, but this place was packed, and there was plenty of other places to park for people who weren't using the pumps. Am I wrong? Am I the asshole here?

EDIT: The woman paid for her gas with a card at the pump, meaning she could not have over/under bought the wrong amount of gas. There were other people behind me in line waiting for that row of pumps as well. I did not tap my horn until she shut her door and started to walk towards the store.

7,1evmf1z,AITA for telling a good friend that I don't want to go on vacation because they exhaust me?,"Beginning last week, I let my group of friends know that I would not be going on vacation with them for a few days at the end of the month, I gave the reason that I do not have all of my uniform items accounted for or ready for a new job that I have coming up beginning in September. There was a lengthy discussion where I explained that this job is very important to me and that I want to make sure that I have time to make corrections to any items that are messed up or wrong and that depending on when we would get back on Friday (08/30/24) I would not have time to make any adjustments as the following day starts a three day weekend in the US.

Fast forward to the next day and I get a box that contains most of my uniforms, upon reading the packing label I notice that there are a couple items on back order included the uniform dress shirt. I mentioned this to my friend Jane who tells me that I should let the people organizing the vacation know that I have most of my uniforms and let them know if I changed my mind or not about going. I said that they were right about that, but I got busy the rest of the day and forgot to talk to the friend organizing the vacation.

The next day (Friday), my friend Joe called me to tell me that he picked up his uniforms and asked if he could pick mine up if they were there, he was told that I had already picked them up by the employer. Joe and his girlfriend then call Jane and start asking Jane why I am still not going on the trip. At this point Jane reaches out to me to tell me that I should talk to Joe and his girlfriend about why I am not going on the vacation.

I called Joe and his girlfriend separately since I knew they were together to talk to them but only got voicemails, eventually Joe‚Äôs girlfriend calls me back and I talk to them about the trip. I mention that while I have most of my uniforms I do not have them all and I still need to make sure that my protective equipment for the job comes in and is all correct, I reiterate that I do not have set days for when these things show up and that if they arrive while we are on vacation that I will not have time to correct them until after my on boarding starts where I need the uniforms and equipment.

Joes‚Äô girlfriend explains that this trip would be the last one in a while for the friend group we are in as we are all venturing out and taking new jobs etc. I explain that I get that, but I am just exhausted by the fact that I repeatedly need to explain and defend my decisions to the group and that I don‚Äôt want to spend 3 days with them since it feels like the dynamic of the group changed from us all being supportive of each other now to I have to defend myself constantly. I also made the point that if Joe and his girlfriend have questions about my choices that they should call me and not someone else.

8,1evmerb,AITA for defending my cousin and challenging my relatives?,"First time posting here but I value a stranger's opinion so here it goes.

I am Turkish(28 M) and my cousin is half Turkish and half American (my uncle her dad from my mother's side, my cousin is 24 years old and lived her entire life in US) 

My uncle is a very troubled man, he is alcholic and I am pretty sure he has some mental health issues. (regular sleep deprivation and temper tantrums) 

He and his daughter (my cousin) came to us as guests to Turkey for a summer holiday. (Us = me + my parents) 

Yesterday on the beach while me, my cousin (let's call her Z for now) and her two friends (came from US along with them) were relaxing, my uncle came to the beach as well but he didn't see us, neither did we see him. 

When we were leaving, he saw us and stopped us. 

He started screaming in the middle of bunch of strangers and in front of Z's friends, at Z, saying some pretty harsh words because he thought she was ignoring him. (Didn't even tell us he would be coming)

Z was speechless and decided to walk away. He said some more things which at this point I do not remember but we left.

That got me pretty fired up, for me he was not in the right to do that and she was innocent. I decided to walk back to the beach and speak my mind. 

I spoke to him pretty loudly because:

1. An eye for an eye, he get's to be ashemed infront of strangers just as Z did.

2. I was hella angry.

In short I wanted him to realize he was wrong to do that and he needed to apologize to his daughter. I also made it clear I would not see him as family until he did so.

I also told him I would inform my mother on the situation (his sister), which I did. She went on and on about his mental health and asked me to be quiet about it and so I did for the rest of the day.

Today we had a simillar incident (screaming in public at my cousin also threatening) and this time I decided to mention this to my dad (pretty much head of the house in a way + one that I trusted) but I lost my temper and called my uncle an idiot on the phone while talking to my father) 

I can explain the details of why it happened again (screaming etc) in case anyone's curious. 

My dad scolded me for calling my uncle, a relative an idiot and also added I didn't nor anyone else had a say in their family matters. 

This in particular pissed me off but I kept my mouth shut about it. (My dad sounding like a conservative, traditionalist but says he isn't every conversation outside) 

I answered that she might be my uncle's daughter but she is also my cousin and she is in the right. (She 100% is) He said it doesn't matter and I said(very harshly) ""let's agree to disagree"". 

AITA? 

Edit: I feel like I was wrong for referring to my uncle as an idiot while talking to my dad and I am not 100% sure if I should be involved in these matters. Basically my father's comments are making me question myself and I don't know if my uncle's mental health is a reason to keep my mouth shut. 

Ever since they arrived I wanted both of them to have a good time in my country and among my family. But I think I cannot handle the fact that my own little cousin is being treated more like a property rather then an individual. I felt I was treated that way for the longest time when I was young by my own parents until I grew up and went my own way.

9,1evm2q8,AITA for being disrespectful to my aunt for crying racisim over nothing?,"I am a teenager living in the United Kingdom. At the time of writing this post, I am staying at my cousin's house. In the house, there are my 3 cousins, my aunt and my uncle.



¬†Earlier today, we were watching the movie [~Green Book~](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6966692/). We got to a point in the movie where one of the characters, Dr Shirley, asked another character, Tony (Lip) Vallelonga , if instead of using his full last name to announce him, Tony would instead use the last name ‚ÄúValle‚Äù instead?



My aunt decided to pipe up and say ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Racist.‚Äù She then proceeded to enter into a tirade where, in the world today, if the roles were reversed (if a white person asked a black person to shorten their name) it would be considered discrimination. I didn‚Äôt know where this came from but me and the second eldest cousin (the middle cousin) tried to debate this issue.¬†



The argument snowballed as it continued, with me and my cousin saying that asking someone if they can be called a shorter name is not racist as that is not a direct attack on a person while my aunt kept saying that ‚ÄúThe Equality act states that asking someone to shorten their name can be considered discrimination‚Äù. The argument got so intense that when my aunt tried to change what she said and my cousin picked up on it,¬† she told him to shut up.



Eventually, My eldest cousin (the one my aunt barely yells at) joined the conversation and said that my aunt was right (the movie was paused at this point). Me and my cousin kept arguing that asking someone to change their name is just bad manners and not racism while they kept saying that asking someone if you can call them a shorter name at a workplace, (my aunt keeps saying that if it were people of different races except white) you could be sued after the age of 18. My know-it-all aunt then decides she wants to continue watching the movie she just ruined with her politics.



¬†I was furious that my aunt doesn‚Äôt see herself as what she is saying as anything but fact. She thinks like that but she says that *we* shouldn‚Äôt get stuck in our ways. The hypocrite.

I said that I didn‚Äôt want to watch this movie anymore and I walked out of the living room. As I did that, I slammed the door behind me



I heard yelling from the living room that ‚ÄúNO ONE SHOULD DISRESPECT ME LIKE THAT‚Äù from my aunt and the same thing from my eldest cousin. My eldest cousin called me out of my room and yelled at me that ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt slam doors in this house. I'm gonna give you a moment to calm down, and when you're calm, you're gonna apologise to me and my mother.‚Äù My Aunt called me out and got right in my face to say the same thing. I saw her eyes red as if she was about to cry. Pathetic. I'm not giving any of them an apology.

I heard my aunt talking on the phone so I doubt she will be the last to yell at me. I need an outside perspective on this. Also, someone please tell me if what my aunt is saying is true.

10,1evlxym,AITA for wanting my boyfriend to go to a funeral with me?,"My great aunt passed away today, and her funeral is this coming Saturday. 
We were never really that close, but she has done a lot for my family over the years. (Helped us out of debt and possibly losing our house). She's very close to my parents.

When I first found out she was sick and in the hospital, I was told many times that she wanted to see me and my boyfriend (dating for 4 years) before she died.

I was shocked and touched, as I didn't think I meant that much to her, but we went.

When we went to go visit her in the hospital, she spent most of the time talking mostly to my boyfriend. Wanting to know more about what he does and what plans we had for the future.
She said how happy she was to see us and reminded me how she kept telling my family that she needed to see us.

2 weeks later, she's gone.

My boyfriend made plans to go to his buddy's cottage (like he does once every year), and that falls on this coming Saturday. The same day as the funeral.

My mom called me and asked if he could be a pallbearer.

I asked him if he could go to the funeral with me and if he wouldn't mind being a pallbearer. He said that he didn't, but that he can't because he already made plans.

Am I the a**h*le for being upset that he doesn't want to go?

EDIT
Reading all the comments has given me a different outlook on the situation. Thank you to everyone for your insights, I am no longer upset with him, I actually understand where he's coming from.

I grew up in a filipino bubble for so long that hearing other people's opinions helped me realize how crazy my families expectations are sometimes.

I (17f) have not gone to church since I was 12. I grew up in a baptist church but I was never baptized as it didn't ever feel 'correct' for me. Around the age of 12 I just stopped going and I haven't been back since. Partly because I feel no reason to and partly because it's a small church where my return my draw attention.

Recently, my younger brother (12m) went forward and expressed to the pastor that he wanted to be baptized. Which is fine. I'm personally not a huge fan of letting kids make big decisions like that but its not my place to judge. There is no set date for his baptism at the moment.

I'm here because I know my family will pressure me to be there. My grandmother and my brother were discussing it this morning and my brother mentioned me. My grandmother replied, ""she'll be there too!"" in a rather certain tone while I was sitting in the same room. I had not been asked if I'd attend nor did I express interest in being there. For my brother's sake I sort of just smiled along. 

I understand that it is a big thing for him but me and him aren't close either. There have been times in the past where he has told me that he hates me and we argue frequently.

After I had been assigned a room my actual roommate added me and we began talking. However, he soon blocked me and I could no longer contact him. 

A week after this happened my suite-mates got in contact with me. They added me and we talked. They then asked me if I happened to know my roommate since he was the only one they hadn‚Äôt talked with yet. I said yes but after we talked a bit he blocked me.

So after much discussion thats the best answer we could come up with as to why he did so. I thought that was the end of that discussion but it seems I would be wrong. 

One of my suite-mates, lets name him Phineas, would later tell us that we should vote on who got the room. I being confused asked him why since I got the room fair and square by it being assigned to me. He said that he wasn‚Äôt aware that the rooms were assigned and that even if they were, we should vote on who gets it anyways since he wanted it. I told him no for a second time and wanted to be over with it. He then told me that he had a girlfriend and that I could understand right? No. I get that shes going to visit every now and then and that it would be nice to have some privacy, especially if they were going to do spicy things, but I already told him that I wanted the room since it was assigned to me and that if he wanted a single he should‚Äôve booked a single. 

He keeps pushing the matter when I shut him down every time. I told him that if he continues to talk about it, I would go to RA and get in contact with the school about the whole situation and how Phineas wanted to violate explicit rules and guidelines of living in the dorms. 

For more context: our college does not allow the opposite sex to enter the bedrooms of the student and may only stay in the common area with the suite door open to the hallway. This was a strict rule that even adheres to parents and family. The guy called me a dick and said that I don‚Äôt even need it since I am single and would never understand it.

13,1evl5sl,WIBTA if I cleaned my sister's shared kitchenette / laundry room space after I made repeated requests for her / her boyfriend to do it?,"I probably already know the answer the this. But I'd like to ""assk the m""ass""es.""

I have a situation where I rent my lower level space to my sister and her boyfriend (already made a note for later that business and family don't mix). In most respects, they are good tenants. The problem lies in their cleanliness. I'll be easy on their specific apartment space (their bedroom, living room) since that's 100% theirs. However, because of the layout and the perks, their kitchenette is shared with the laundry room that we both use. There is also a second bathroom downstairs that is shared between us. I do not personally use the kitchenette, but I do use the laundry regularly and the bathroom occasionally when I'm working in the garage.

Here's the meat of the issue. When they cook, they leave dirty dishes to sleep in the sink for days at a time. What's worse is that when they use kitchen appliances (stove, air fryer, microwave), they do not clean up if something spills. So, the food bits stay on the table, or collected in the air fryer (where it is cooked over and over with each new meal). They also leave bags of garbage in the garage (they have garage privileges) AND kitchenette to build up and stink, instead of taking the full bag(s) out when they leave to work or something.

We have already had issues with bugs, and not the random one or two that come up during a storm or something. Real, bad ass cockroaches. Someone came and laid traps/poison to deal with them.

I have made my sister aware of the issue and was told that it was her boyfriend's responsibility to do all of these things. Interestingly, this bf has ADD issues supposedly, where he can only focus on one task and if he switches tasks he will forget the other.

I don't wish to poke at any legitimate people with legitimate ADD issues, since I know it's real.

But this just sounds convenient. Especially since I've heard him say that he's seen something dirty in one bathroom they have (they have two), and instead of cleaning it, he was going to tell my sister about it. But then because he was worried about my sister suggesting he clean it himself, he avoided the bathroom altogether. See why I'm casting a bit of doubt on the ""convenient"" ADD thing?

I am in a bind because of the whole family/business conflict. I obviously don't want to go to extremes, like ""legal action"" according to the lease (there is a provision about maintaining the property in good, clean order). However, it's gross and also affecting me, since those bugs can infest the entire house.

Therefore, WIBTA if I went into that shared space and cleaned their kitchenette, cleaning all the grease and who knows what else from the countertop, top of fridge, just so I don't have to gag every time I go in there.

I know that if I were to do this, I would be not only enabling this behavior to continue, but things could get worse, since they might feel they have a maid.

So, what's your verdict/advice/comment?

14,1evl4tz,AITA for ending a 6 year friendship over my ex stepmom?,"For background, I (18f) met my best friend (18f) back in 7th grade. For the sake of the story let's call her Em. At the time I was living with my dad (41m) and his ex wife (36f). We'll call her T. T married my dad in 2015 when I was 9. At the time I thought she was amazing, but after they got married, she started showing her true colors. She was verbally and physically abusive towards me and my two sisters (19f and 15f). Anyways, fast forward to now, her and my dad have been divorced for 4 years now, though they had a son (3m) together back in 2021. After they finally split, she took my brother, and my dad didn't want to take any legal action. The solution was letting T visit with my brother every so often in his apartment. It is no secret that I dislike T, though I don't go out of my way to be disrespectful. Em and I lived 5 hours away from each other and I proposed she spend a month at my apartment since I've lived on my own almost as soon as I turned 18. The only issue with that was that T and my brother were staying with my dad, who lived down the road from me. Em knew about my hatred towards T and was okay with that, but after about a week she started acting weird. I work a lot so she spent time with my younger sister and brother- by extension T. She came to me a couple days ago and told me that I should have a conversation with T, since she apparently told Em that she had no clue why I was always avoiding her. Immediately, I shut that idea down. I explained that I've tried to have a conversation with her before, which ended up with her playing the victim card. She said she understood my decision and it was left at that. A day or so later, I was playing with my brother, and T asked if we could talk. I quickly said ""no"" and went back to playing. I left shortly after because I had a cake in the oven. Em texted me once I was home and asked why I wouldn't give her a shot. I explained to her about how T wasn't a good person, and all the things she's done to me and my family, why I dislike her and don't want to have a relationship with her. Em told me that it was in the past, and how I need to put in more of an effort to forgive. At this point, I was really hurt, and left to sit in my car for a few minutes as I cried. When I got back inside, I set up a pallet in my living room and was going to sleep there for the night. Em came over and told me I was being selfish and that I needed to get along with T for the sake of my brother, to which I quickly shut down, saying that I didn't need a relationship with my brothers mom in order to have a relationship with him. She kept trying to reason that I have to put up with T for my brother, to which i kept shutting down. She mentioned that she knew what broken families were like (she was adopted when she was a baby and both of her adoptive parents are together) and that I needed to make sure my brother never felt like that. Kept pointing out that she was my stepmom- which she isn't anymore. Eventually I stopped talking at all and she left to go stay at my dads. She came by today and took all of her stuff to my dad's. I asked a close friend and she said I should've been a lot meaner about it and that I should have some self respect. I have decided I'm taking her home as soon as possible since I have school and work, but my other friend says I should just let her figure out a way home.

19,1evkt8n,AITA for rollerskating in my room?,"Am I that one bad roommate?

I live in an apartament in Poland with really thick walls. This is good, because I have like six roommates and living in a place where I can hear all of their buisness would be torture. I can't hear anything from my room - it's only after approaching their door rhat I can hear them playing tv shows or whatever. In any case that has made me a bit bolder with my free time. 

Recently I decided to practice rollerskating in my room - no riding around or jumping or anything to spare the downstairs neighbour, just the heel-toe trick. It's like a movement in place - trying to balance on the heel and the toe of both rollerskates at the same time. In any case I went out into the corridor wearing them to throw out a plastic bottle or two. A bit stupid, I admit, but I thought, it's just the next room over, might as well get in and get out quickly. I was spotted by one of my roommates - an older woman who doesn't like me already. She immediately gets incredulous - which is fair, rollerskates not the usual home footwear standard.

 But she starts getting pissed that I don't think about anyone else in this house, that some people might be trying to sleep already. I said, if she couldn't hear me before, then I certainly wasn't interrupting anyone's sleep. And if I was being too loud she could always knock on my door and tell me to cut it out. 

She says I never listen to what they tell me anyways - which is just not true. We suddenly stopped sharing supplies and nobody told me, but I still bought my own, even though I'm very tight with money. They're really pedantic about cleaning (want every dish to be washed immediately after cooking) and I do that as well. I'll admit there are times I'm in a rush and do an, admittedly, bad job, but I always fix it when I take notice or when it's pointed out to me. I never invite my friends, even when they bring their entire families, I always share things when asked, even when I'm a poor student and they're job-having adults. Hell, I barely get out of my room to not get in anyones way.

She told me she might not be able to hear it but the man next to my room has work in the morning. I stopped, but before that I asked her if he said anything about me being too loud or disturbing his sleep. He never told me anything about that, never alluded to me being too loud and he once got me out of my room to put my food from one pan to another. (We share all dishes, except for that one singular pan apparently, and I was never told.) She didn't answer and just went to her room.

She says I never listen to what they tell me anyways - which is just not true. We suddenly stopped sharing supplies and nobody told me, but I still bought my own, even though I'm very tight with money. They're really pedantic about cleaning (want every dish to be washed immediately after cooking) and I do that as well. I'll admit there are times I'm in a rush and do an, admittedly, bad job, but I always fix it when I take notice or when it's pointed out to me. I never invite my friends, even when they bring their entire families, I always share things when asked, even when I'm a poor student and they're job-having adults. Hell, I barely get out of my room to not get in anyones way.

She told me she might not be able to hear it but the man next to my room has work in the morning. I stopped, but before that I asked her if he said anything about me being too loud or disturbing his sleep. He never told me anything about that, never alluded to me being too loud and he once got me out of my room to put my food from one pan to another. (We share all dishes, except for that one singular pan apparently, and I was never told.) She didn't answer and just went to her room.
Am I the bad roommate or are they being unreasonable?




EDIT: yeah nvm it's totally on me lmao. I have to do some work on myself, I don't want to be that kinda person ",1.0,1.0656688213348389,1,1
20,1evkkfl,WIBTAH for potentially getting my stepdad admitted into a care home ,"Hey everyone.

Would I be the asshole for telling his doctors everything and getting stepdad sent to a hospital or care home.

To give a bit of context I‚Äôm a 21 year old male, live with both my mom (53) and older brother (23) and stepdad (84M)

Stepdad has been living with us for the past two years (coming on 3) now due to health complication, diabetic, kidney failure (stage 3) and multiple myeloma and some mobility issues.

So I‚Äôm the only one in the house that isn‚Äôt working full time (only part time as I‚Äôm a student) and I‚Äôve noticed SD has very poor communication in how he acts towards me or even my mom. By constantly swearing, screaming or even hurling racist insults about anyone (to the point where he‚Äôs been attacked TWICE as a result)

Anyways, with this poor language and such. We constantly have to scold him by saying ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt say this.‚Äù, ‚Äúthis is NOT appropriate.‚Äù The typical ‚Äúwatch your language‚Äù sort of responses. As racism and hurling it in public and then deflecting it onto myself is very very agitating as last thing I‚Äôd want is to get into harm for his own stupidity and actions.

We also was told by HIM directly that he uses disinfectant to shower near his eyes and body when he showers as ‚Äúit makes me cleaner‚Äù and begins to justify his actions in which we‚Äôve told him politely ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt use disinfectant it‚Äôs not for your body, it‚Äôs for the cleaning of our house. Not for cleaning your body.‚Äù He keeps saying ‚Äúyeah right, fuck off. I know what‚Äôs good for me and you don‚Äôt know shit‚Äù

It‚Äôs gotten to a point where he constantly now uses it and even if we hide it, put it far out of reach.. he will go out of his way to search for it.. and I‚Äôve told his doctors in a one off conversation and they told me ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt say anything as he seems to be in a right sense of mind‚Äù but I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äúhe‚Äôs definitely not in the right state of mind if he‚Äôs doing that‚Äù as that isn‚Äôt ‚Äúhealthy thinking behaviour‚Äù 

He then tries to get very physical to the point where he‚Äôs throwing things cause ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not letting him do what he wants.‚Äù Which I don‚Äôt understand cause the only things we‚Äôre enforcing is common sense and it‚Äôs safety. Like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt wash yourself up with floor cleaner‚Äù, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt use cleaning chemicals near your eyes or body‚Äù very trivial/straight forward things..

So I‚Äôm wondering WIBTA. Considering we‚Äôre in the midst of moving and obviously him living with us. And telling his doctor about all of this and potentially putting him into a care home/hospital 

Side note: as his finances are separate from my mom‚Äôs (not combined) we need some of his money to work on the new place we‚Äôre moving to also.

Throwaway account because you know how it is. 

My wife (f36) and I (f33) live in the north of the country, and we‚Äôre traveling south for a particular event. My wife planned the 4-day trip around the event and also around my birthday which is on the second day of our trip. 

One of our mutual friends lives ~1h away from that southern city and knows about our trip. Therefore, they texted me asking if we wanted to meet up. I said yes of course (thinking my wife would not have an issue). Turns out I was wrong and she‚Äôs having BIG issues. 

She says that this was supposed to be a trip for only the two of us. Says that I‚Äôve now shown her how much I don‚Äôt want to be with her and how little I value our time alone. And that I‚Äôm making a huge dent in our relationship by having made this plans. I offer to cancel but she said the damage is done. 

I said that the plan was always including her, I thought it could be a fun experience for all of us, just having dinner with this friend for a few hours on the first day we arrive to the city. Since I know she‚Äôs not the most social person, I did say that if she doesn‚Äôt want to join is also okay, which  is where I think I might have been the asshole. But I honestly do want her to come with us, I‚Äôve told her many times that everything is better when she‚Äôs with me. 

I‚Äôve been struggling a bit lately with wanting to be more social and having been married to the love of my life who‚Äôs not a very social person for the past 10 years it‚Äôs been hard on that regard. For the longest time I thought I didn‚Äôt want to be social, and I‚Äôve never been a natural at that so I let it be. But now I recognize that I do want to be social, just need to practice I guess. We‚Äôve talked about how I understand her not wanting to socialize but that now I understand and need to validate and prioritize my need of meeting other humans from time to time. This being a trip planned around my birthday, I thought it would be okay.

So, first of all, I should say that this thing might not seem like a big deal, but I'm just a teenage girl and it's on my nerves so much and I'm feeling kinda guilty now.

So about a week ago, I was getting ready to go to my grandparents house to spend time with them and my other family members, including my cousins and aunts and uncles. I was getting ready when I suddenly got a call from my best friend. She was crying so bad and I was panicking. She told me her uncle just into a car accident and passed away. I broke down too and started crying with her.  I don't know why, I had nothing to do with her uncle, I never even met him, I just heard about him and the things he have done, but it happened. I was so sad. I think I was more sad and concerned for my bsf about how she's gonna feel after it. 

After an hour or so, I had to go to my grandparents home even though i really didn't wanted to. My parents forced me to. I was in a really bad mood, my eyes were all red and I didn't even had the energy to talk. From the moment I arrived, my cousin was around me and he was trying to make jokes and annoy me. He's just 10, and we always been so close, so this things was usually normal for me, but not that night. 

First I just tried to avoid him and don't talk to anyone at all, my voice was shaky and I was sure that if I open my mouth, I would break down again. But my cousin didn't stopped, and I was getting more annoyed and frustrated. I suddenly snapped and told him to be more quiet, I'm not in the mood, and stay away from me. I admit that my tone was kinda harsh at first, yes, bit then i realized it and tried to tell him in a softer tone than before. But then he was looking sad, and my aunt, his mother, gave me dead eyes, she was like she wants to yell at me. That made me a bit ashamed of myself. I'm also disappointed in myself for making my favourite cousin sad.

28,1evjay5,AITA for demanding my friend return the birthday gift I gave her because I don't like it?,"I (27F) have a close friend, Jenna (27F), who recently celebrated her birthday. I‚Äôm pretty good at picking out gifts and usually try to get something meaningful. This year, I decided to give Jenna a handmade necklace from a local artisan. I thought it was beautiful and would be something unique for her to wear.

Jenna seemed genuinely pleased when she opened it at her party. She thanked me and wore it for the rest of the evening. However, a few days later, I saw her wearing a different necklace that was more my style and less‚Ä¶ well, let‚Äôs say less ‚Äúartsy‚Äù than the one I gave her.

I felt hurt and a bit insulted, so I texted Jenna, asking if she could return the necklace. I told her that I didn‚Äôt think she appreciated the gift and that it would mean a lot to me to get it back. I suggested that she could use the money to get something she really wanted instead. Jenna was shocked and said that she was actually really happy with the necklace, but she hadn‚Äôt been wearing it as much lately because she was worried it might get damaged.

Despite her explanation, I insisted that she return it. I told her that if she wasn‚Äôt going to wear it, it was better for me to have it back. Jenna eventually agreed, but she seemed upset and hurt by my request.

Since then, our friendship has been strained. Jenna has been distant, and I‚Äôm starting to feel like I might have overstepped. I was just hurt that she wasn‚Äôt wearing the necklace I picked out and thought it might be better for her to get something she would actually use.

Here‚Äôs the deal: she still lives at home with their mom. She doesn‚Äôt have a job. No career plans, no real goals from what I can tell.

But like, am I crazy for thinking this? I thought I was just trying to help. Someone needed to tell her the truth. I feel like they‚Äôre overreacting.

There‚Äôs a lot more that I didn‚Äôt include because this is already long, but part of me feels I‚Äôm being too sensitive; the other part of me feels like I need to keep protecting my space and just let Ali go. Idk but I need some advice or someone to say snap tf out of it and don‚Äôt let Gia bother you. Thank you in advance for any sort of advice. ",0.0,0.1063791811466217,0,1
34,1evitlg,AITA for letting my kid play at a wedding,"Teo weeks ago my sister (Jenni F29) got married to (Jordon M31). Their ceremony was outdoors with around 20 tables, each sitting 6 guests. I (F26)was the maid of honor and my husband (Santi F27) a groomsman. 

A couple months back when I received the official wedding invite my sister had left a note on the back of the invite stating that she had no problem with my daughter (F2) attending the wedding. Originally my husband and I were going to have her stay home with a sitter but unfortunately the sitter canceled last minute and we had no choice but to take her with us. 

On our way to the wedding we informed the bride, groom, and my mother about the last minute change. Both the bride and groom liking the text but not replying. My mother however asked what your plane were now that the babysitter had canceled. At the time we told her that we weren‚Äôt sure. 

Once at the wedding though, before I had to go get ready I found my younger cousin Dani (F15) and asked her if she could watch my daughter for the majority of the ceremony in exchange for money. She agreed and my daughter was handed off. 

During the ceremony I noticed that during the exchanging of the vows Dani and my daughter were gone. I didn‚Äôt learn until after the ceremony that my daughter had gotten restless and bored resulting in Danny taking her over to the playground nearby. 

The wedding went off without a hitch to my knowledge but earlier today I got a text from Jenni saying ‚ÄúJordon and I were looking back at the wedding video and I noticed that Dani and (my daughter) weren‚Äôt in the photo. Them missing from the video is messing up the image I wanted my wedding to give. Mom told me that Dani took (my daunter) to the playground, which can be seen in the footage. I am just telling you this to let you know that I will be having the photographer crop Dani and (my daughter) out of the final photo so that no one notices any inconsistencies with the guests‚Äù.

I am very upset by this but I do sort of u understand where my sister is coming from. She‚Äôs always dreamed of having the fairytale wedding and in her eyes my daughters and cousins disappearance messed with her vision. But I also know that my daughter is 2 and it was better for her to be removed from the setting then stay and potentially start crying.

We live directly next-door to his mother (52f) stepfather (49m). My husband and I both work very demanding jobs, but because I have more normal hours, I am responsible for picking up the kids at the end of the day. At the beginning of the year, my husband and his mother unilaterally decided to pull my kids out of the daycare they going to because ‚Äúthey didn‚Äôt think it was safe. ‚Äú. I still have yet to see any evidence that the daycare was unsafe, but they gave me the flexibility I needed to pick up my kids around 6 PM every night. So my mother-in-law found a daycare, and because she‚Äôs a real estate agent who owns her own brokerage, she took it upon herself to pick up my kids when the daycare closes at 4 PM.

She often asked to keep the kids overnight as well, which I‚Äôm happy to oblige because they also have a waterfront property and bring my kids there to go swimming and kayaking often. 

This past Tuesday, I was struggling to leave work on time and let my mother-in-law know that I was going to be late. Her response was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just going to keep them overnight. You picking them up this late is going to disturb their bedtime routine‚Äù

I proceeded to call my husband and tell him how upset I was that my mother-in-law was keeping the kids without even asking me. I used the term hostage because she‚Äôs extremely overbearing and controlling at times. 

My husband asked me what my alternative was to the current arrangement, and I suggested that the kids switch to a different daycare and school that‚Äôs closer to my work so that I can pick them up at the end of the day. My husband, then insinuated that I was doing this just to spite his mother, and that I needed to go see a doctor and get medicated.

Then proceeded to conference call in his mother without telling me he was going to do that, so that I could tell her exactly how I feel. His mother was sobbing to me on the phone that she didn‚Äôt mean to upset me or hurt my feelings and she is easy-going and if I have a problem with something, I should just tell her directly. 

By this point, it felt like I was getting ganged up on, so I let them both have it. I told them they were making all the parenting decisions without really involving me, that these were my kids, not her kids, and my husband was a piece of shit for not supporting me, and backing me up.

My mother-in-law and I have not spoken since that interaction, and my husband and I are on very thin ice. I‚Äôm not going to insinuate that I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, because I know there are things that I could‚Äôve done better and handled differently in the situation, but, am I the asshole for handling this the way I did?

ETA: I‚Äôve had ongoing issues with MIL and her disrespect of boundaries. I trust her completely with my kiddos, and I am extremely grateful to have her around my kids, but she does not know when she‚Äôs stepping over the line. She‚Äôs cut my son‚Äôs hair without asking, chastised me for feeding my kids spaghetti-os, she gives me tons of unsolicited parenting advice. When my son was first born, she would barge into mg house unannounced and grab my son. It‚Äôs not just a one time scenario.

The last time she spoke to my grandmother, about something other than my grandmother asking for money was years ago. My extended family has all rallied together to make funeral arrangements, it is traditional for the oldest child to plan the funeral, hence my uncle planning the funeral on my birthday.
However that's not all, the funeral is planned the week of my birthday and the following week. When I was informed, I was disappointed as I have been looking forward to this birthday since I was younger.
However in my dad's words ""My birthday is not important. This (funeral) is important"". One solution was offered to me being staying with my dad's girlfriend while they both travel abroad. The catch being my mom is not okay with that and is pushing me to join her. She has acknowledged that it's dangerous for me to go to Nigeria, but that I have to do, what I have to do. My mom has also mention that my aunt (61) also has her birthday the week after mine, the day before funeral festivities end. I've talked to friends and get mixed reactions some saying | can celebrate on a different day, and some agreeing it's not fair.

My doctors so shocked, l've already had three reach out for use of my story, interviews, and medical papers recoding this 'phenomenon' as l'm the youngest person with my underlying conditions to go through this surgery.

47,1evgzq7,AITAH because my friends bike got stolen after I parked it,"I'm  26M and I have a friend 28M we both does BMX. Recently we were doing an off-road BMX  in a nearby place with some friends  and he had an accident and he broke his leg. He was moved to the hospital in an ambulance he had to leave his bike behind. His bike is an expensive one which costs something close to 3000 EUR.  The place of the accident was little far from the our city and we (all friends) didn't want to leave the bike behind. We asked him and he said that he can't ride the bike for a while so it's not good to leave the bike there.  

So two days later, I went there with a car and I brought the bike back to our town. He has  a bike parking place  adjacent to his apartment which can be accessed without the key. We locked the bike there with his lock and left and I kept the key.  The plan was that we will move it to his bike storage when he comes back from the hospital as we didn't have the key to access it.
He went to his girlfriend's apartment from the hospital and he was still staying there.

We left the bike there one night and the next day when he came the bike was stolen with the chain cut behind.

He is now arguing that I should bear the cost of the stolen bike because it was stolen because I parked it outside instead of parking it in an internal bike storage. 

I refused because it was anyway parked outside at the place of the accident and there is an equal probability of it getting stolen from there as well. 

The other people are refusing to get involved and they said this should be discussed and fixed with me and him.

I know it's annoying to be in there that long as our house only has 2 full baths. Which is why I think it would be beneficial to everyone if I'm allowed to have the sink because its really all I need.

I got the ok from my parents and moved all my stuff in yesterday. After I was done my parents said they are giving the room to my brother 12m

I was upset because they had let me move all my stuff and then told me this. My brother has his own room, so he is gonna get TWO rooms. He sleeps everywhere but his room.

My parents said it would be fine and that I can still use the bathroom. However my brother has already started telling me that he is still gonna use my sink. That he is gonna move his stuff in too. The sink it self is very very small. I don't have that much stuff but both of our things isn't gonna fit comfortably. On top of that he is a total slob.

I tried to explain to him why I should get to use the sink but he is being his usual difficult self.

Also, I myself can't move into my sister's room because I have too much stuff and the rooms are small. The only way my stuff fits in my room is because I have a loft bed and my room has the highest ceiling.

We are on a team and another team member invited some of us to their birthday party. They messaged us the invitation earlier this week and I never said I would go for sure. My best friend did. 

The day of the party my best friend messaged us and asked if we were going to which me and our other teammate said we didn't know but we will see how we feel since the party was from 9pm-2am. My best friend said they would go after work so most likely around 10 or 11pm. I told my best friend to message me when they were done with work so I could decide.

9:30pm rolls around and my sister needed a ride home from work so I picked her up and during that time my friend got off work and messaged. I said I was planning to go but I was picking my sister up and it would take time. My friend headed to the party straight from work.

When I got home it was already 11pm and I had a stomach ache. I probably could have still gone, but I was tired and socially drained from work all week. My tail light was still out on my car so I would've needed to borrow one of my parent's cars to go (I used my dads car to get my sister) and the party was 45 minutes away.

My friend messaged around when I got home  to ask if I was coming. I said my stomach hurt but I would see if I could get it to go away and would update them. 11:30 pm they messaged again to ask if I was coming and I was starting to make myself get ready but told them I was debating. They messaged back and said ""don't come. I don't want to force you to go."" I replied with ,""you're not forcing me. Part of me wants to go."" No reply from my friend after that.

I sat there for 20 minutes trying to decide whether to go or not. It would have been 12:30 by the time I got there and then I would have to come all the way back at 2am when it ended. My mom was also encouraging me not to go. With all these factors in mind I messaged my friend, ""ok I'm gonna be lame and stay."" No reply after that either. 

The next day I checked my calendar and there was a concert we had known about for at least 3 months that we talked about going to so I messaged by best friend and other friend to ask if they wanted to go that evening. My best friend messaged back and was upset that now we wanted to make plans to go out when we could have gone last night and it would have been free instead of spending money for dinner and a concert. I honestly hadn't thought of the perspective of spending money or not so I apologized for that but tried to explain some of the factors that influenced my decision not to go in hoped they would understand.

I have been around for a large part of the kids lives so we are no strangers and when they are here they are treated no differently.Most of the time we have no issues (yes small arguments here and there but nothing major).We do regularly get calls from mother to help defuse situations at her home as kids don‚Äôt seem to have a lot of respect for rules over at hers & a handful of times I‚Äôve had to go and collect one of the kids to live with us (this has only been temporary as I have had to move things around so I can get them to school but still get myself to work and Robyn to childminder - so it‚Äôs a lot on me as John works a lot! But within a week or 2 all emotions have calmed down & able to return). 
Enough back story, now let‚Äôs decide if I‚Äôm the A**hole.

I (34f) and my husband John (36m) have 4 children - 3 (Stacey 13f, Amy 12f, Oscar 10m) from his previous relationship and 1 (Robyn 3f) together. my husband have been together 8yrs and married for 5.Johns kids stay with us every fortnight, 2 weeks during summer, week at Easter & Xmas period this has been the set up from before I was in the picture. I have been around for a large part of the kids lives so we are no strangers and when they are here they are treated no differently.Most of the time we have no issues (yes small arguments here and there but nothing major).We do regularly get calls from mother to help defuse situations at her home as kids don‚Äôt seem to have a lot of respect for rules over at hers & a handful of times I‚Äôve had to go and collect one of the kids to live with us (this has only been temporary as I have had to move things around so I can get them to school but still get myself to work and Robyn to childminder - so it‚Äôs a lot on me as John works a lot! But within a week or 2 all emotions have calmed down & able to return).

I'm planning on furthering my education in the Navy and going to C school for X ray tech. I already have a Bachelors in medical Psychology and 3 years in the field. However, I bought a house 3 years ago and would like to be paid a little better than what I am now (17/hr for mental health Counseling) and talked to a recruiter and can potentially join the Navy and become an officer. 

The only problem is that I have a house and am single. Since I don't have any friends in the area, I asked my mom if she would be able to keep up with my bills when I'm in boot camp (yes I'll give her the money) and once a week check on my house since it will sit empty. 

I asked her to empty the dehumidifiers in the summer and run hot water through the pipes in the winter. Maybe drive my car every now and then. Since she lives 30 minutes away, I thought maybe once a week would be enough. 

I'm going to be paying her for doing this. I got a buddy that said he will mow a few times a month for me. 

Am I asking my mom for too much? She's part time at her job right now and retiring in the next 4 years. I would ask my neighbors but I don't really trust telling them that I won't be home for the next 4 years lol.

52,1evgid3,AITA for forcing my friend to pay for car damage after I sold it? ,"I (35M) rented one of my extra cars to one of my best friends, BB (25F). It‚Äôs like a 2014 Ford Taurus, 80k miles, valued around 10k-12k. The plan was for her to rent it until she could secure financing to purchase it. She ended up getting into a car accident which did damage to the entire back end of the vehicle, deployed the airbags, and the vehicle was unable to be driven. 
After a cluster-F with the insurance claims being denied, she promised she would pay for everything out of pocket, even if she had to slow pay me payments, but her plan was to still buy it and pay for the repairs herself. 
My mechanic said for the cost of all the airbags, new trunk, bumper, lights, labor etc., the cost would be like $6,000. But he could get it drivable for around $2000. 

The options I gave BB: 
1. Buy it for 10k and repair at your leisure. 
2. Fix it for 6k (which is the cost of the damage). 

Well we decided on the 3rd and worst option: pay $2000 for the minimum repair to get it drivable and ‚Äúeventually‚Äù buy it for 10k. 
So BB paid the 2k even though the overall value of the car was diminished and there were no airbags and the truck wouldn‚Äôt open and close, it still drove fine. üôà

One year goes by and BB has yet to come up with the 10k to purchase it, and has zero dollars to put towards it. So I trade it in for another car. Because of the damage, the dealership only gave me 2500 for it. 

After hearing what I traded it in for, BB is angry that I‚Äôm still wanting to charge her $4000, the cost of the damage minus what she already paid, since I took such a big loss on the trade in. 
She‚Äôs also super pissed that I didn‚Äôt give her the option to buy the car for $2500, since that‚Äôs what I traded it for. üò≥

So I asked her if she wanted to come hang out, and she said no, she was tired from work and just wanted to go home.

Now to today, it was an already planned outing with both my siblings and my mom just gave us a stink eye and said,""Thanks for inviting.""

AITA for not making this sibling outing into a family outing??",0.0,-0.0015925469342619,0,1
58,1evgaq4,AITA for asking my bf to go another direction,"My bf & I planned to meet after my work ended @ 5pm He‚Äôs still in uni & was coming to meet me after his classes. Omw, he mentioned wanting to watch a football match that night but said he was low on cash & asked if I could buy the tickets. He absolutely loves football & even though I don‚Äôt know much about it, I wanted to make him happy so I got the tickets. He said he‚Äôd be late and ended up arriving almost 2 hours late.. I didn‚Äôt mind waiting, though I was just happy to see him. I even got us both pizza while I waited because he said he‚Äôd be hungry.

When he arrived I was overjoyed. He went to the washroom first I was waiting outside, when he came out I literally ran to him & hugged him, my way of showing care. But then he mentioned that he saw his ex fwb earlier that day at uni & she had offered to drop him off at the stadium, but she kept making wrong turns which caused him to be late. He said she was a bad driver. I didn‚Äôt like that he accepted a ride from her, but I didn‚Äôt say anything because I knew he‚Äôd probably get upset, accuse me of not trusting him, and lecture me about trust. I didn‚Äôt want to ruin our date, so I let it go & i trusted him too. 

He explained the match to me which was nice. When we were exiting the match, we could either go straight or turn to take an escalator toward the train. I suggested going straight but he insisted on turning. I agreed to go his way, but then he kept asking, ‚ÄúWhy did you want to go straight?‚Äù I honestly had no reason, but he kept pressing me, so I repeated that I didn‚Äôt have a specific reason. Since the stadium was crowded, I thought maybe he couldn‚Äôt hear me, so I said it louder. That‚Äôs when he got really angry, accusing me of making a scene and causing a commotion in public. I didn‚Äôt understand why he was so upset and when I tried to explain, he got even more furious which scared me & I started crying.

The argument escalated & security guards came over asking if I needed help. I told them to leave us alone &walked with my bf in silence to the train station. But even there, he was still angry, saying I was lying & hiding the real reason I wanted to walk a certain way. I told him again that I had no particular reason, but he refused to believe me. At that point, a station worker approached me & asked if I needed help, which made him even more upset. He said they assumed he was the problem just because he‚Äôs a ‚Äúbig black guy‚Äù and he felt like they were treating me as the innocent victim.

She delayed it because of me but now because the property taxes on the house increased a lot, she told me I have until she finished renoing her house and selling her house to take Junior. It caused a lot of fights with her because I cannot find a single spot that will let me take Junior. 

Junior even though he is a mix is very obviously a pitbull and now most landlord do not allow dogs and when they do they always request to meet them. All of them say no as soon as they know he is a pitbull. I have literally tried with hundreds of landlords and even mom and pop and no one will let him. The housing market is very expensive and never competitive and no one wants to rent to a dog owner. Even my friend‚Äôs corgi had a lot of issues and most people don‚Äôt have prejudices against corgis. When I first moved out I found a place that didn‚Äôt care about Junior but the landlord was sketchy and the place was falling apart. Any place that decent won‚Äôt take my dog. I‚Äôm terrified I‚Äôll be forced to put Junior in a shelter where that will likely be his last stop given his age and breed. All the no k*ll shelters are all over capacity and none of them will take him. I also reached out to friends and social media if they will adopt him and no one wants him. The only people who responds looks sketchy and pit bulls are often exploited so I won‚Äôt let him go to a stranger.

My bf has a good job and so do I, together we would qualify for a home. He even says he wants to be a homeowner and has saved a lot of for a downpayment. I‚Äôve talked to him a lot about getting a house because that‚Äôs the easiest way to ensure Junior will have a place, especially with a yard that he needs. But he says he doesn‚Äôt want to buy a house now together we are not married and we already agreed to date a year or 2 longer before getting engaged. That‚Äôs before I knew my dog wouldn‚Äôt be welcomed in any rental. He refused and last week told me to stop asking because he used his would be downpayment to pay off his student loans. He says my dog isn‚Äôt important enough for him to risk years of savings on buying a house before we are ready. I yelled at him that I was ready and he clearly wasn‚Äôt sure about our relationship if he would take away the option of buying a house without discussing with me. He got mad and yelled back it‚Äôs his money and I yelled he cares more about money than my dog and he clearly hates him and wants him to die! He left and hasn‚Äôt come back all weekend and ignored all my texts and calls.

But then he started saying that his schedule isn't going to be interfered with by anyone, even if it's family.

My purse had some of my identification (Student ID, expired Learner's Permit) and money. Yesterday, I didn't notice because I just needed my phone for verification during another event.

That night, I checked the house and my parents' cars for my purse and didn't find it. I figured I would check on-campus for my purse on Monday because I would be there already for a club event I was running. I've done the walk of shame around campus before for other things I've forgotten (I try to prevent myself from losing things by patting myself down for things I'm supposed to have, scanning the area I was sitting in to make sure I didn't forget anything, even checking as I walk away from a building just in case the previous two didn't work, but sometimes it happens).

The event was held at the same building all day, so I knew which rooms to check.

My parents were upset last night that I forgot my purse and told me they'll take me on-campus to look for it today. I understand why because identity theft would suck, and I knew this was an inconvenience for them as well. They explained anyway because I guess my reaction wasn't harried enough -- I've had the ""don't panick"" lecture enough in my developmental years to have a decent poker face when things go wrong, but c'est la vie.

However, after she explained why losing my purse was a problem, my mom paused, then said that this was a   
""\[insert ex's name\] all over again"" and walked off. The relationship she referred to was in my freshman year of college, and I ended it at the end of spring semester that same school year: it was two years ago.

When she found out it was abusive last year when I was working through it with Title IX, she didn't take it well, and she occasionally brings it up when she notices I don't come to her for things.

I am not angry at my parents for being upset that I lost my purse. I am just upset that my mom keeps bringing my ex up when she thinks I'm not communicating enough. I want to work through the mental habits that kept me in that relationship in the Title IX-recommended, school-paid therapy I got into and just...only have to think about him when we're working through how to avoid encountering each other at the start of the semester.

I argued that If I were to be a legitimate employee of his business legitimately working part time, learning the business, and actually performing tasks for the business then my compensation should not be considered him paying his half of the rent. I argued that if I were to do this I would be helping him out because he would get the benefits and he did not know about that when he signed the lease. He argued that it doesn‚Äôt matter how his half gets paid and he‚Äôs doing me a favor because I get to learn how his business works and can continue to do it after I graduate if I so desire.

When I told him I may not want to work part time at his business because I am already working 20 hours a week at a different part time job, and I‚Äôm taking 15 credit hours, he got really mad and said if I don‚Äôt want to take his help by being an employee, then I can figure out how to pay for my tuition and rent for the rest of my college.

67,1eve4jq,AITA- for making husband skip work trip?,"Husbands a pilot (42), I work from home (43), married for 12 years with two kids. 
I‚Äôve been coughing for 4 months now- and have been through a barrage of doctors and exams including X-rays and chest CT‚Äôs and the thing where they put a scope up your nose, the final one is in a month for an endoscopy to see if there‚Äôs an issue in esophagus. One of the possibilities (though uncommon) is cancer. I do have GERD and have been on 80mg omeprozole for about 6 weeks but it hasn‚Äôt eliminated the coughing. 

Husband works full time with a ‚Äúon demand schedule‚Äù so is often gone (for instance he‚Äôs gone for two weeks now), and is usually home for less than 10 days in a month, in addition to that, he also takes contract trips to make extra money to fund an airplane that he purchased (about 150k), he does between 1-4 trips a month for that. 

I‚Äôm not sure that it matters because I support him having his own hobbies- but I don‚Äôt love to fly- and the plane he has is cost prohibitive to take for fun. Meaning it‚Äôs more convenient but it‚Äôs much more expensive to fly somewhere in it than to drive or fly commercially. Just mentioning that because the plane he pays for isn‚Äôt really a family purchase. Its benefits are really for my husband. 

I asked my husband if he can take off for the date of my endoscopy, he said yes. Then a week later, I notice that he has a contract trip planned (which is an ‚Äúon the side‚Äù job- that money goes towards the plane he purchased) on the day of my appointment and checked in with him. He‚Äôs upset with me for not checking the schedule when I booked it (this was a cancellation I squeezed into- the next normal opening is in an additional 3 months, since my cough is 4 months old - I‚Äôm very excited for answers and treatment- whatever it might be.)

He said that the trip is worth 4k to him (each day trip is 1k, and he frequently books these- 1-4 a month), and he‚Äôs not canceling it. 

Because the only appointment available is for 6am, and I‚Äôd need to leave at 5am, I‚Äôd need to book a babysitter for 5am on to get our kids to school, and find a friend to bring to an appointment at 5am (they‚Äôll need to take off of work to do that). 

For clarity- the money for the trip during the appointment goes directly to his airplane hobby- not the budget and doesn‚Äôt benefit the family in any way. 

From my perspective- he has to cancel the trip, or find a replacement pilot,  and take me to my appointment.

From his perspective- I‚Äôm overreacting and it‚Äôs up to me to figure out my appointment. 

Am I the asshole for making him cancel? 

(Updated: I just wanted to say thanks- I‚Äôve never posted here before but I found this a strangely cathartic experience. My husband and I talked for a long time‚Ä¶ and he‚Äôs coming with me now, but more importantly‚Ä¶ he understands why this was such a big deal to me and it‚Äôs opened up deeper conversations about ways to make me feel more supported at home.)

69,1evdvp0,AITA for not helping or supporting my mom financially when I have a lot of things to pay? ,"Hi, I'm currently 19F. Currently working student, and I live with my family. For context, my mom and dad got divorced. My dad supports us, but not enough since we are a lot in the family, which led me to work, and last year I started working in June 2023, and I also stopped school for a year. At that time, I was able to give freely (financially) to support my mom, even though I'm not happy with it because hard-earned money should be for my school, but she told me that she'd pay me back. But guess what? That never happened. A lot of things happened at my work, and I stopped working at my previous company in January 2024, so I was unemployed and doing nothing and kind of helping my mom with her eatery for like 3 months until my mom pressured me so much to get work, and until May 2024, I tried to apply, and fortunately I succeeded. I'm still giving my mom a part of my salary, but not that much since I'm preparing for school this year. There was this one time when my mom told me not to go to school and just provide my money to my siblings (22M, 17M, and 13F) who are currently enrolled. Well, I said no and still enrolled myself. I provide my tuition fee, school uniform, school supplies, and everything about my school and work. I'm also forced by my mom to pay for my sister's (13F) tuition fee. Then again, I slightly felt good because I was able to help my sister, but I wanted to pay my school first so that I have no problems in the future. Right now, this August My mom kept on shouting at me that it's affecting my mental health because I wasn't able to give money to her (when in fact she said that I don't have to give her anything for a month.). The reason I wasn't able to give it to my mom is that I paid my debt to my sister's and brother in law, who my BIL fixed my computer. I have to pay for my books (my book costs at least 500 PHP per book, or 25 USD), my ID (it's not included in my tuition fee). I also have to buy my PE uniform. Which makes my money to 2000 PHP or 107 USD, and I have 15 days for my next paycheck to come, and I still have to go to school and my work.

Note: It feels like I'm not being transparent. I have four other siblings. (27F, 22M, 17M, and 13F). My BIL (26M) is the one who fixes my computer. My sister is married and has a daughter (1F). She is supporting our finances, but not all the time. Since she doesn't have work and is a stay-at-home mom for my niece, she helps our family when she can. My mom wanted her to be obligated when helping with our finances and to get a job since my BIL is only giving allowances to my sister, but since my sister already had a family on her own, a house on their own, she has to prioritize her family first.¬†",Not the A-hole,2024-08-18,"AITA for not helping or supporting my mom financially when I have a lot of things to pay?

My boyfriend (M36) let‚Äôs call him Joe, and I (F27) work in the same store (it‚Äôs a franchise) I‚Äôve worked for this company (and owner) for four years and my goal is to work my way up and eventually own one of these stores myself. 

A year ago Joe and I moved to a new city when the owner I work for was moving to a bigger store and asked me to come with her. He started working for this store when we moved here because it was easier for scheduling as we also have a daughter together.

Our store is currently undergoing a huge expansion, we are both apart of the team that is setting up this new portion of the store. We both have our own small crew that we are in charge of, then we have a project manager, let‚Äôs call him Paul, that comes from corporate that oversees the whole project and makes sure we meet our deadlines and directs what we do. We work Monday to Fridays from 6am to 2:30pm. Our project manager doesn‚Äôt usually come in until around 7am. That usually leaves Joe and I completely in charge for the first hour of the day. Which is no problem at all as the three of us have usually discussed the day prior what the priorities for the next day of work are, and in addition to that Paul will text Joe a list of tasks to get done for the day and he then passes the info to me.

With all that in mind our problem starts here. Our crews are mostly made up of younger school/university kids, from 15 years old to 18, most of them already worked in the store previously part time. Joe had been having trouble with the kids on his crew as they didn‚Äôt really follow his direction or when they did they did a half assed job and he had to finish what they started. He got upset to the point where he decided on Thursday he just wasn‚Äôt going to come to work the next day (Friday) because he didn‚Äôt want to deal with them. 

This leaves me in a tough spot because I am now responsible to instruct his crew on what to do the next morning and I have no idea what they had been working on previously. On Thursday, Joe left work for the day, I stayed late to try and finish up what I was working on, but before I left I went to do a walk around with Paul to see what the plan was for the next day and asked that he tell me what to do with the kids on Joe‚Äôs crew as he decided he wasn‚Äôt coming in the next day, Paul then asked me for my phone number so that he could just text me the To Do list instead.

I ended up telling Joe Saturday night that I had told Paul he wasn‚Äôt coming in and he‚Äôs now mad at me for being a snitch and saying that I‚Äôve betrayed him and have made him look stupid to our boss and he can no longer tell me anything because he doesn‚Äôt trust me.

72,1evcnit,AITA for not driving?,"Bob and I made plans to go to a drive thru branded caf√© and go back home.

Dod instead said something along the lines of ""we will go."" 

While we were having fun in the car, I told Dod to drive, in a half joking manner so as to not appear mean. To which he half-joked with me and said no. (The reason why I joked is because I'm not used to asking for favors). 

I then stopped the car and told him that I don't want to, as I didnt plan to. To which they responded with something along the lines of ""you are already driving. If you don't want to, then get out of the car, and don't come with us to the shop."" To which I said ""that isn't fair, because I originally didn't plan to, and we didn't discuss this."" I then decided to drive regardless because I'm not used to discussions like these, but since I couldn't find the location, they decided to drive instead (almost had an accident as they were angry). 

Later, whilst returning home, Dod said that its not about keeping ""score"" of who drives and who doesn't, as families dont work that way, and that its similar to monkey scratch me ill scratch you. And that they are tired of speaking and having a discussion and to just go (our family has histories of mental stuff, so its understandable?) 

I now understand, and I told them that the reason I did this is because I originally told them that i dont want to, and that I've already made a plan, and they didn't give me a reason as to why I should drive, so I opted to act based on how I feel instead of reasoning, as I assumed that's what they were doing.

Bob and I made plans to go to a drive thru branded caf√© and go back home. But then Dod decided to come along and said ""we are going to a vape shop afterwards,"" to which I said something along the lines of ""I don't want to."" Bob also said that they didn't want to. Dod instead said something along the lines of ""we will go."" 

While we were having fun in the car, I told Dod to drive, in a half joking manner so as to not appear mean. To which he half-joked with me and said no. (The reason why I joked is because I'm not used to asking for favors). 

I then stopped the car and told him that I don't want to, as I didnt plan to. To which they responded with something along the lines of ""you are already driving. If you don't want to, then get out of the car, and don't come with us to the shop."" To which I said ""that isn't fair, because I originally didn't plan to, and we didn't discuss this."" I then decided to drive regardless because I'm not used to discussions like these, but since I couldn't find the location, they decided to drive instead (almost had an accident as they were angry). 

Later, whilst returning home, Dod said that its not about keeping ""score"" of who drives and who doesn't, as families dont work that way, and that its similar to monkey scratch me ill scratch you. And that they are tired of speaking and having a discussion and to just go (our family has histories of mental stuff, so its understandable?) 

I now understand, and I told them that the reason I did this is because I originally told them that i dont want to, and that I've already made a plan, and they didn't give me a reason as to why I should drive, so I opted to act based on how I feel instead of reasoning, as I assumed that's what they were doing.

73,1evcbtt,AITA for blaming a girl in our friend group that she may have caused me to be ostracized in our friend group?,"During our middleschool and highschool years our friend group was really close and used to hangout a lot and even eat lunch together. But during our senior years we kind of drifted a bit apart. But despite that we would still keep in touch and even celebrated my friend's bday party at his house. One of my friend's girlfriend which was also part of the group started being cold to everyone when prior to that she was kind of a happy personality (albeit more on the feisty side). Me and that girl were classmates and we often had group works in school, and every time we interacted it felt like she had a strong hatred for me.

 Later on I found out she was having mental problems and didnt feel comfortable with any guy as she stated. I understood of course and just kept my distance and didnt bother her as much. All of us shared a discord server where we would post memes, watch movies, post art and generally chill in the server. There was also another server where it was mainly for minecraft stuff and gaming. Slowly, the first server died down and only a few people were chatting, then eventually most of them left. . After school ended, I started applying for a Japanese school abroad so I could get the desired level in order to enter a University. At this point we still kind of kept contact, sometimes some would accompany me when I attended a convention to compete in cosplay competitions. When it was the week I was planned to leave for Japan, I wanted to meet all of them one last time, so I planned a hangout session either at a local go-cart area or an amusement park whichI would have paid for. They all sadly declined, but of course, I understood, we're adults now. 

When I settled in Japan I could occasionally talk with some of them in the first discord server, although it was just maybe one or two of them because most of them had already left that one.

 At that moment all I could think of was they had some sort of prior hate for me, or the girlfriend may have talked bad about me in someway.

74,1evc0yo,WIBTA for Keeping my Makeup in the Bathroom?,"I (21M) have been sharing a room with my roommate (23M) for about 5 months. It is a tiny space, as we eat at a mess hall and work outside the space - it's just a bunk bed, some storage for clothes, and a washroom so small I can touch each end with my hands while my arms are bent. 

I wear makeup, and my roommate doesn't. When we first moved in I bought some little magnetic  shelves to hold my stuff, mainly in my bunk but I also got two for my makeup/accessories. The storage space provided in the washroom is basically nonexistent, so I thought it'd be smart to add my own.

80,1evbbf0,AITA for ignoring a friend after she gave me $100,"


I (29F) lent my friend & her boyfriend outfits to wear to an Indian wedding.For context:I am white,my husband is Indian & we had outfits from a previous Indian wedding, probably around $200 per outfit. I had no problem letting her borrow them for the event. Fast forward about 4 months: I haven't really seen or heard from this friend. To be honest, didn't think twice about her having the clothes, since we live in the US and don't wear Indian formal wear frequently lol. At this point, my husband and I are actually going to India for a few weeks & we have a formal event where we would love to wear the outfits. We are packing for our trip, can't find them & we then realize, Friend has them and never reached out to return. I contact Friend and she responds frantically, saying she feels bad but she won't have time to meet up prior to our trip. Oh well, my husband and I use it as an excuse to buy stuff while we are there.

When we come back home, a few months pass, & we've made some attempts to meet up with Friend (both in group and 1 on 1 settings). Each time she does not come. Finally, I explicitly ask when she will return the outfits.She says she is happy to just ship them to me. At this point, I'm annoyed that she can't sacrifice a few hours of her day to meet up and spend time together. I respond if that's whats easiest for her, then sure. Fast forward weeks, haven't heard from Friend, and haven't received anything. 

Now, out of precedent, I decide that I shouldn't be the one who has to pester her to return clothes that I've lent her. I'd rather just be done with it & accept that I'm not going to be getting the clothes back & the friendship seems as good as done.

A few weeks later, I invite a group over, and she is in that group chat. Perfect opportunity for her to hang out, and return the clothes. Everyone else in the chat responds that they're coming, she is radio silent.Finally on the day of the event, my husband explicitly texts her on the side asking if she will be coming & reminds her that she still has our clothes. She responds one hour before the event that she will be there. I am actually MORE annoyed at this point that she decided to come only when she was explicitly reminded that she still needs to return the clothes. I reached out to her & told her I was quite frankly annoyed that she decided to come so last minute & it seemed like she was only doing so because she was called out. She was shocked at my response, and when she finally came over she returned my clothes, and gave me a $100 gift card with a thank you note. 

This final act pissed me off the most, because it felt like hush money in a weird way? Like, take 100$, absolve me from all blame in how I handled this situation.

All in all, I might be the asshole for being petty and waiting for her to reach out & return my own clothes, & then getting annoyed when she gave me money to make amends. What do you think, Reddit. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-18,"AITA for ignoring a friend after she gave me $100

To be honest, didn't think twice about her having the clothes, since we live in the US and don't wear Indian formal wear frequently lol. At this point, my husband and I are actually going to India for a few weeks & we have a formal event where we would love to wear the outfits. We are packing for our trip, can't find them & we then realize, Friend has them and never reached out to return. I contact Friend and she responds frantically, saying she feels bad but she won't have time to meet up prior to our trip. Oh well, my husband and I use it as an excuse to buy stuff while we are there.

When we come back home, a few months pass, & we've made some attempts to meet up with Friend (both in group and 1 on 1 settings). Each time she does not come. Finally, I explicitly ask when she will return the outfits.She says she is happy to just ship them to me. At this point, I'm annoyed that she can't sacrifice a few hours of her day to meet up and spend time together. I respond if that's whats easiest for her, then sure. Fast forward weeks, haven't heard from Friend, and haven't received anything. 

Now, out of precedent, I decide that I shouldn't be the one who has to pester her to return clothes that I've lent her. I'd rather just be done with it & accept that I'm not going to be getting the clothes back & the friendship seems as good as done.

A few weeks later, I invite a group over, and she is in that group chat. Perfect opportunity for her to hang out, and return the clothes. Everyone else in the chat responds that they're coming, she is radio silent.Finally on the day of the event, my husband explicitly texts her on the side asking if she will be coming & reminds her that she still has our clothes. She responds one hour before the event that she will be there. I am actually MORE annoyed at this point that she decided to come only when she was explicitly reminded that she still needs to return the clothes. I reached out to her & told her I was quite frankly annoyed that she decided to come so last minute & it seemed like she was only doing so because she was called out. She was shocked at my response, and when she finally came over she returned my clothes, and gave me a $100 gift card with a thank you note. 

This final act pissed me off the most, because it felt like hush money in a weird way? Like, take 100$, absolve me from all blame in how I handled this situation.

All in all, I might be the asshole for being petty and waiting for her to reach out & return my own clothes, & then getting annoyed when she gave me money to make amends. What do you think, Reddit. AITA?",0.0,0.0851318687200546,0,1
81,1evax96,AITA for not apologising to my family ,"Well go back to the start In COVID. I hadn‚Äôt really spoken to my family a great deal pre Covid. I had a relationship breakdown, and they all sided with my ex. So when COVID hit, my sister Louise started to ring me multiple times a day as she was struggling as a single mother. She didn‚Äôt live far from our father‚Äôs house, who also, only started to speak to me during COVID. 
Sadly, our father passed away. After the funeral, we all had a lot of personal things going on. They decided they wanted to go on holiday. But due to my partners poor health, didn‚Äôt want to go. This led to many arguments caused by my Aunt, we will call her Claire. Lies that my partner was manipulating and controlling.
The next summer, my siblings decided to go on holiday again. This time I decided I would go, and my partner stayed home with our puppy.
Day one. I get there late afternoon. They haven‚Äôt set up the tents, so I help out. Then before we can do mine, older brother decided that we would all go out for food, and do mine after. Annoying. But I went along. 
Then came day two. William has a gf, who‚Äôs as manipulative as W is. So she decides to start making snide comments throughout the day about my appearance, how I‚Äôm treating my nephews and her son, which Ignore. Then after our meal,  Claire makes comments ‚Äúhalf brother‚Äù, and nasty comments as to why my child isn‚Äôt with us.
So after W refused to stop her, I left and drove home in the middle of the night.
18m later, I‚Äôve still not spoke to my W. L ignored me, my partner and child at her youngest‚Äôs birthday party due to C being there.
Now it‚Äôs just over two years after I‚Äôve spoke to my brother. I have some health issues, and discover I have cancer. I get In touch with my family, and let them know. But ask them not to tell my brother. They agreed at the time. 
But C is a controlling puppet master, and doesn‚Äôt like no. 
I have my first surgery, and all seems to go well. 6 days later, due to complications I‚Äôm sent back to theatre and spend several weeks in an induced coma due to sepsis. 
When I‚Äôm awake, I find out that not only did my sister and aunt plot to send my brother to see me when I nearly died, but she refused to come see me when they were warned I might not live past 24 hours. C had a huge argument with my partner that she is controlling, and never liked her, because she only wanted to come visit me when I was awake and not in an induced coma, and because she respected my wishes and didn‚Äôt let W in to see me.

I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything so I had assumed it was just delivered to the wrong door. He asked me if I had any evidence of it not being in my house, or else he was going to make a police report against me for theft.

The postal worker seems excited and angry at this point and asks me if I can provide him with this footage.

I wasn‚Äôt really assuming any wrong doing from any parties but I‚Äôve never heard of postal workers coming to investigate missing packages so I‚Äôm curious.

I have a cook and a cleaning lady.
My work schedule is very irregular where I 36M work in operations have to sometimes work during the day and or at night and sometimes I am away for a few days on a stretch. I have a cook who comes in at her convenience and makes meals for the day for me. I cook myself so usually I leave instructions for doing most of the heavy lifting of making bread and chopping veggies etc and I usually finish it according to my taste, sometimes I just let the cook make complete meals if I know I will be too exhausted to cook. I trust this cook to do the work and keep my kitchen clean whether I am home or not and have made arrangements for her access. It is convenient because she is tech savvy and able to follow instructions well she is not a cook who's food you would find delectable but she does her job farely okay. 
My wife 29F who works in another city comes every now and then for a couple of days a month or I go to hers.
Last week she decided she would take some remote work and decided to stay for a week. I had some days off so I cooked for her during those. During the week the cook had planned to take her paid days off, she also could not make the food according to how my wife likes when I was not home for a work day as my wife was deciding the menu. The next day she took a sick day and caused inconvenience to my wife(it was a busy work day for her). My wife also disliked the food prep because she is used to a very strict diet and very picky about it's preperation. 
Where my wife lives, the cook makes delicious food although for me I find it too oily and spicy. I on the other hand am particular about the amount of oil, salt and spices in my food. I did reprimand the cook for this but my wife wanted me to fire her outright. Even though I told her I will take care of it the next time she comes over or will replace her when she moves permanently (in a month) or for a longer duration.
My wife who was leaving the next day, went ahead without asking me and made arrangements to hire another cook.
It is a small community and my cook found out and now is acting strange and fears for her job security and it is affecting the quality of work and now I feel there is no scope for her improve the cooking.
I told my wife off and was upset that she went behind my back, I told her it was not her place to do this and she has overstepped, that it adds to my work of now finding another cook who is able to take instructions and cook according to my needs and my timings and can be trusted with my kitchen and it's cleanliness. It takes a few weeks for anyone new to actually start work according to my requisites.

87,1ev8y49,AITA For telling my grandparents my honest opinion about their behaviour ,"Me (15F), my siblings (2M and 10M) and my Parents (40M and 43F), have been living with my grandparents ever since I was little, because they had a big house, and begged us to stay with them since they didn‚Äôt wanna give it up but also weren‚Äôt able to take care of it alone, we live in a small upper apartment that has 2 rooms, a bathroom, and a kitchen connected to the living room, and since there‚Äôs 5 of us its very small to fit all of our stuff, and I‚Äôm the only one who has a room on her own, since both my brothers share a room with my parents, last year we wanted to renovate the attic, and make rooms for my brothers, since it‚Äôs pointless for me as I am leaving this September for school, as we started to clean the attic my grandparents started to get involved, telling us it‚Äôs pointless to renovate it, and we should just give up our belongings so we would all fit, they‚Äôve always been like this, they invaded our privacy (visiting our half of the house while we were gone, and went as far as snooping thru our things) in 2008 before I was born my grandparents wanted to renovate THEIR part of the house, so they asked my dad to borrow money from the bank and give it to them, to which he did because they promised they‚Äôll pay it off, we thought it was for the whole house renovation, but they only renovated their part (got a new kitchen, a new bedroom, and even bought a small garden tractor). A year later my grandpa made my dad pay it off for them, since they didn‚Äôt wanna loose all their money, a few months ago I had a big panic attack around Finals, which resulted in me getting hospitalised for 3 days, to which my grandma said and I quote ‚Äúit‚Äôs pointless to get stressed, over something you‚Äôll never achieve anyway‚Äù. Which caused a big fight between them and my parents, and they told us we have time till September to move out, otherwise we will be kicked, it‚Äôs been a few months and they pretend like nothing happened, they visit our half of the house, invite us for dinners, and try to act like nothing happened, yesterday they were with us and my grandma said something along the lines ‚ÄúElizabeth (me) I can‚Äôt believe you actually got in and are draining your parents to pay for school, you will never finish, sometimes it‚Äôs good to admit you can‚Äôt do something and just give up‚Äù.

Those being our cooks, while the three other servers have cars. 

I started a year ago and ever since I got my car, they've been non stop asking for rides home when we close the store at around 10:30 PM. It'll be 1-2 people per ride everytime and they use to ask hours in advance before we clocked out and were ready to go home.

I would reluctantly agree because I have a ""keyholder like"" position and I have to stay and lock up the store and set the alarm and watch everyone leave. It's either we clock out in time after they ask me for a ride home or we're waiting about 20 minutes past close for some ride they called.

Over time I thought this would go away but our boss continues to hire more and more international students without a car. And I think the others tell them I give rides and it's become ""expected of me"" from the coworkers, to the point they won't even ask me for a ride until we clocked out and I thought they're other ride was here because they didn't mention it AT ALL to me.

PSA NOBODY has ever offered me gas money or any compensation for driving them home. Even if it's on MY way home, it's still gas, time, and I have to force conversation when I'm extremely tired.

One of our other servers mentioned they probably don't even understand to give me gas money because they're from India and they didn't even know until recently you're supposed to tip servers and food delivery people.

But a few weeks ago I went on a three week trip to Japan and I have no idea how these people have been getting home. First day I come back, me and this other girl clock out and we're walking to the door ans she asks ""can you drive me home?""

and I just flat out lied and said I moved forty minutes away and I need to go home. she was SHOCKED I said no and started calling everyone she knew and nobody got her. and then begged me to drive her home saying it's only 10 minutes away. 

*I had to drive her home. No gas money compensation. nothing.*

All the other servers know I'm lying and they fully agree but I think some of the cooks caught on and they're really upset with me because I'm known as like the ""really nice one"" to work with. Quiet, does their job, doesn't really manage that much even if I'm a little more in charge than most people.

I graduated last year and started working in September, and worked two jobs until I quit the lower paying one in April. I'm currently working full time, remotely, and am close to finishing my Masters. 

I've been sitting on the idea of moving out since May, when my probationary period at my job was completed but didn't say anything out of fear. But yesterday, I brought up the idea of moving out next spring to my mum and she lost her shit.

I said that I would be able to look after myself and I would have saved enough to cover costs over the next few months before moving out so I would have a safety net. There's just not enough room in our house and there's no sense of privacy. I've taken on caring responsibilities since I was 12 and I'm just so tired of doing it. 

She's saying that she had so many expectations for when I would start working and if I move out, who's going to pay the mortgage (I've been paying this since December)? and that she's given me so many freedoms but it's my fault that I don't have much of a social life (I'm not sure I agree with this). I don't have any plans to ever get married and she essentially said that if I'm not marrying, then I shouldn't need to move out. More things were said but I can't include them because of word count. 

She's been acting off with me since and she's told my step-dad and I can't read his reaction as he's not spoken to me yet but I think he argued with her, blaming her for me wanting to move.

Recently there was a regional photo contest near my area, however I wasn‚Äôt a part of the community that put it on and therefore wasn‚Äôt eligible to enter. I was completely okay with this as I like to enter other photo contests in my communities but I digress. I have a family member in that community who asked (repeatedly) to enter a couple of my pictures from grand Tetons national park into the contest under her name so it would be eligible for prizes. I refused because I didn‚Äôt know the terms of the contest and whether or not the picture became their IP when entered so I couldn‚Äôt use it in my own contest. 

The rest of my family seems to think I‚Äôm selfish and that I have dozens of pictures good enough for these contests, and that this family member is just trying to be helpful by putting my photos in more contests.

96,1ev80jq,AITA for not letting my brother vent at me about his family troubles again?,"My brother is on the way to getting divorced and he's also opening his eyes to the problems in his family. I let him vent a couple of times but it felt like I was being vented at instead of to, and it also felt like there was a layer of blame being put on me that I didn't like.

My brother was in this complicated relationship for like 10 years with Grace. They had a daughter together Milly (8). When Milly was 5 Grace died in a car accident. My brother was used to relying on Grace for all the day to day things with Milly so he asked if I'd step in and help him and I did. She was at my house most of the time. I mentioned to my brother on a few occasions that Milly was having trouble coping with her moms death. But he ignored me. About 16 months after Grace died my brother told me he was dating someone else. He wanted me to tell Milly and I told him he needed to be the one to tell her. He waited three or four months and then he decided it would be easier to have Steph move in with them. Of course Milly didn't cope well with that either. Then Steph became pregnant so my brother and Steph got married at the courthouse.

Steph tried really hard to reach out to Milly and act as a parent to her. But Milly was angry and lashed out at Steph a lot. My brother decided Milly shouldn't spend as much time with me because it would prevent her and Steph getting closer. During Steph's pregnancy, she tried to get Milly excited about the baby and I think she was truly hoping Milly could accept her and the baby. I don't think she handled things perfectly but I also think she was very unsupported by my brother just like Milly was. Steph confided in me during the later stages of the pregnancy that she regretted getting involved with my brother and moving in because Milly hated her and was so mean.

Once baby Lily was born it was just a matter of time before Steph had enough. My brother was still leaving everything to Steph. Milly was still angry and lashing out and rejecting Steph and Lily. It took Steph telling my brother she was so close to done for him to do anything and they started therapy together. But the longer they are in therapy, the more Steph wants to divorce. But my brother doesn't want that. He's now realizing how much Milly is suffering too. How angry and sad she is. He's paying attention to all the times she yells at Steph that she's not her mom and she wants her mom back. Or the times she says she feels like her mom was forgotten by almost everyone, because she knows I haven't.

My brother has vented about this to me a couple of times and like I said, I feel vented at and like some blame is being put on me. Thursday he called and tried to start that shit again after therapy and I cut him off and told him I wasn't going to listen to this again. I told him I'm not his therapist and I refuse to take any blame for what happened. He told me I'm supposed to be his sister and I should care about his feelings too. He accused me of abandoning him.

People in our friend group tend to be more nice to her because she gets sad easily.This has never been a problem before, but in recent years, there are some serious issues in her family.

Samy has changed a lot. When someone disagrees with her, she would fall out with them. She wasn‚Äôt like that before the mental issues. One friend pointed out her selfish behaviour and got told to never speak to her again.

She gets what she wants now. She is often prioritised for having some sort of mental illness. She can skip lessons if she wanted to and I would have to finish the group projects on my own and she will still get credits. She would give people an ‚Äúimagine going to lessons‚Äù look through windows.

99,1ev6hs4,AITA for deciding not to use my favorite girl name for my daughter like I always wanted because my husbands sister decided to use it for hers?,"My husband and I (30m&f) welcomed our second baby into the world a few weeks ago. We had originally planned to give her a name that I have adored since childhood. But then my husbands sister had a baby girl and she decided to give her daughter this name. It came from nowhere because she always preferred timeless names like Elizabeth, Emily, Emma, Katherine, and so on. The name she ended up going for/my favorite girl name is Seraphina. A lot of people knew it was my favorite and it was our girl name. When I was expecting our son we had mentioned it would be our girl name. Even before having kids friends and family knew that was the name I adored. But I was never fond of family members sharing the same first name. I know it happens. I know it's not the end of the world. Nobody owns a name. I also know that in some families it is very common for relatives to have the same first name. But I personally don't love it. So after SIL had her baby we came up with another name for our daughter.

My ILs had been surprised when SIL had her daughter and announced the name. Most people had expected her daughter to be Emily because she talked about that name a lot. Seraphina came from nowhere with her. When we announced our daughters name, the actual name, after she was born, we did get asked why we had chosen not to use Seraphina and my husband told them we had decided to go with something else during the pregnancy because we felt it was for the best. No specific reason given, at least not that he brought up around me. But his mom and his other sister and one of his brothers did make comments to SIL about it being her fault. They said it was pretty clear our change came because she used the name we intended to use. SIL ended up fighting with her mom because it was always clear I was never SILs favorite person and she accused her of doing it spitefully.

This has come back around to me because SIL has now come for me, saying I should have used the name too, I shouldn't have let her get blamed for stealing a name when nobody can steal a name. I told her I never accused her of anything like that. She told me I didn't need to because the name Seraphina was something everyone knew for years that I loved and then all of a sudden I finally have a girl and use a different name. And it happens just after she also decides to use the name for her daughter. I told her we're entitled to change our minds just like she is. I also told her I don't have to answer to her. She told me I created drama for no reason and there is no way the change idea came from her brother, that it was clearly me who got butt hurt over it. She told me to get over it and there could have been two Seraphina's. She also accidentally admitted she had been waiting for me to confront her on the name. She caught herself before finishing and just went on about how I had changed the name to stir shit and make her family turn on her. She also accused me of using the girls as pawns in this whole thing.

I take care of her, I‚Äôm loyal, and I‚Äôve always been there when she needs me. So, when it came to planning the wedding, I didn‚Äôt think writing vows was a big deal.

We‚Äôre busy people, and between work, wedding planning, and just life in general, I didn‚Äôt really have the time (or honestly, the interest) to sit down and write some long, sappy speech.

I mean, we were about to get married! Why stress over some words when the whole point is that we‚Äôre making a lifelong commitment?

But when I looked at Sarah, she had this crushed look on her face. Like, I didn‚Äôt understand what the big deal was‚Äîshe‚Äôs getting the commitment, right? That‚Äôs what matters.

After the ceremony, she was quiet, and I could tell she was upset, but I didn‚Äôt get why.

It is important to note that we are in college and living at ‚Äúhome‚Äù and our summer break is April to September. 

So recently, as in the past month and a half, I have noticed her mom making little ‚Äújokes‚Äù about me being there. Last month I sat her down to ask her something important and out off the blue her mom goes ‚Äúoh are you moving back home?‚Äù That was the first time. The second was yesterday around 3PM. She started off yelling at my gf about our dog then saying that she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt mind me here because I have no where else to go, but wouldn‚Äôt care if I moved out.‚Äù That to me said enough. My gf was angry but at this point I already knew it was going to happen. 

I called my mom later that day around 5PM to bring up the idea of me moving back home. My moms house is 25 mins from my gfs so not too far. My mom said I was always welcome to and even offered to get me a new bed and accessories for my room again to make it easier however, my gf is not happy. My gf is the type to be upset, but wont stop you from doing what you want to do. I do love her but I also really miss having my own space away from her mother and chaos. She is pretty upset about it but is also kind of understanding? Keep in mind we both go to school and work together and would be able to stay over at each other‚Äôs house regardless.

104,1ev5u7g,AITA for wanting my friend to fix my cloak after they accidentally broke it?,"Almost a year ago, I went to ren faire with a few of my friends. It was my first ren faire ever and something I had wanted to do ever since I was a kid. One of my favorite parts is the costumes, as I'm pretty into fashion. So of course, I spent a long time and spent a lot of money (for a poor person) to create the perfect outfit.  

As we were leaving, I followed my friend out the door. Unfortunately she didn't realize that my hands were full, aka that I couldn't open the door for myself. One of the chains on the cape caught on the door handle and got ripped out. (Annoying that it would break so easily considering how expensive it was, but whatever).

I froze and didn't know what to do. I didn't have anything else to wear costume-wise and I loved the outfit in itself. Plus the cloak wasn't something easily replaced either.

I ended up whispering, ""You broke my outfit."" to my friend while sadly staring at the dangling chain. When my friend saw what happened, she also froze. There was awkward silence for a bit and then she grabbed some sewing items and managed to fix it. I thanked her and left for the event, happy that the problem had been resolved, and didn't think about it again.

A few days later she tells me she was mad at me for blaming her for breaking my cloak. She said that it was an accident and that because of that, she shouldn't be blamed for it. She said specifically that my statement of ""you broke my jacket"" really irked her. And she wanted me to apologize for this.

I told her that I recognized it was an accident and he wasn't at fault for deliberately compromising my cloak. But when you make a mistake, you have to take responsibility for it. If you're holding someone's drink for them while they go to the bathroom and you drop it, you apologize for your mistake and offer to buy them a replacement. It's not anything personal and it's not like a moral failing happened. Mistakes happen, but they're still your responsibility to take care of.

She reiterated her points and said that my PTSD (from the emotional abuse I received as a child) was messing with my perception. She shouldn't be blamed for it and the fact that I was blaming her was my PTSD making me act in a non-acceptable way. I needed to apologize to her and work with my therapist to ensure something like this never happened again.

I ended up apologizing to her and admitted that my PTSD likely had a hand in the way that I handled the situation. I also promised to bring this up to my therapist so we could try and figure out/solve this issue with me.

Looking back on it, though, something just doesn't sit right with me. Was I really the asshole?

105,1ev5sag,"AITA because I enraged my boyfriend by saying ""mice-mousse"" sounds mean? ","This sounds absolutely stupid and I am very upset and confused. 
I had a very bad dream friday night, so I texted my (long distance) bf at 1am to ask for a little bit of company to calm me down again. Since he has trouble sleeping, we have talked prior to this about whether I could call/text him at night when I had a bad dream, panic attack or similar issues, and he always stated he wanted me to wake him up in these situations.

So I texted him. He usually calls me ""Mouse"", but this time he answered with ""Mousse"". It caught me very off guard and made me think of mice in mousse consistency. So I wrote back ""Mice-Mousse? That sounds kinda mean :<"". We texted a little bit about him protecting me and staying with me, when he suddenly told me I was saying weird stuff. I reiterated that I was scared because of my nightmare and apologized for waking him up so late. He continued to tell me that if I wake him up, he does not want to read weird stuff, and that me not being able to differ between dream and reality was my problem and that he wants to be kept out of it. I just wrote back ""ok, sorry for waking you up, sleep well üíï"" because I didn't want to fight.

In the morning I apologized again for waking him, he told me again if I can't differ between dream and reality he wants nothing to do with it. I asked what he meant with that, since I was simply scared after I literally shot up in my bed after a nasty dream.
He got annoyed and told me I can wake him anytime, but when I make everything he says sound bad he doesn't wanna help anymore, and it aggravates him when I ""complain"" about what he says, that I torpedo everything he does. 

Mind you, I didn't complain a single time. I thought mice-mousse sounded mean, so I told him that to hold a conversation. That's it. I told him that it's alright and I wont wake him up again. He didn't like that either. It spiraled way out of hand, he told me I couldn't admit my mistakes, that no normal person would think of blended mice, that I always aggravate him and can't stop for 2 seconds to think if what I say would make him angry. 

We had some fights before, about topics that I now really try to steer away from. I am trying really hard to not fall into habits that annoy him. There is always something new he gets upset about. I told him It's impossible to tell what would make him upset anymore, and that him exploding over everything is a problem for me.

He thinks a normal person who knows how to communicate would always know what would make him upset. He thinks I make him angry on purpose. He broke up with me last night because of it.
 

Would the text ""Mice-Mousse sounds mean :<"" make you upset? It sounded like a rather safe thing to say. Am I actually just really bad at communicating? I am doing fine with family and people at work, but he is the closest relationship I have.

currently, she is trying to keep our thermostat at around 75 degrees in the apartment. shes a small girl, and suffers from an ED, so she prefers things as close to boiling as she can get them. unfortunately, this has only gotten worse over the past week, and she‚Äôs keeping it anywhere from 75 to 78 degrees. 

i am politely losing my shit over it. heat stroke is no joke here, and i‚Äôm NOT used to this heat. i cannot sleep, and have essentially begged her multiple times to PLEASE keep the thermostat at what i feel is a very sensible 72. every time i leave the apartment, or if i dare to fall asleep, she sneaks over and changes the thermostat to as high as she can possibly get it, and its caused me to end up nauseous and dizzy multiple times. i work very early mornings, and its causing me to fall asleep at work because i‚Äôm struggling to get proper rest at home. 

her argument is that she is doing this for her health, because her ED makes her immune system weaker, and makes her get sick often. normally, the second she mentions her ED as part of the issue, i try my best to accommodate her, and i have offered her my winter clothes, and all the vitamins i currently keep on stock, which she refuses. but respectfully, she can wear sweaters and bundle up, i literally cannot remove my skin.

I don't have a great relationship with my in-laws, they're quite intrusive to their son's life. They have strong ideas of how things should be done and think they know better than anyone. My MIL also has the habit to make hurtful comments and if I react to it she pretends it was just a joke. So I'm a bit biased, but I try to make it work for my man's sake, cause he loves them very much.

We recently moved in our new house and his parents wanted to come and help. I felt uncomfortable because, every time they visit, my MIL takes it upon herself to clean and tidy our apartment (we are both messy and fell behind in our chores multiples times so I can understand even if I don't approve the entitlement of doing as she pleases). I was ""scared"" that she would decide where things should go in our new house. So I asked that they wouldn't come, and they were understandably upset about it. She called her son crying multiple times, insisting to come, saying I didn't want her there. It was a bit true but, isn't it my right to move into my new house without unnecessary stress ?

Anyway, we moved a month ago and in a week they're supposed to come visit for ten days. I just learned that my boyfriend will be working that night so I'm all alone to greet them, after my day of work, and collect all the potential comments about what we did wrong. I asked my boyfriend that they come a day later, because it is more convenient for us the next day as he will be there to show them around the house. 

He told them on the phone and they got very upset, my MIL cried on the phone saying we don't want to see them, that it's my fault. I feel like they're overreacting. They ended up having a pretty bad argument on the phone, because apparently she often talks about me, complaining that I never call her, implying that the money I ask of him every month to pay his share of our rent is suspicious, falsely stating that I decided everything in our new house.

At the end she hung up on him, with the threat that they won't come at all. I offered my boyfriend to call her back tomorrow once she calmed down. I won't grovel and beg for her to come either, but I don't want my boyfriend to hurt if they don't come at all. I feel guilty that they argued over the phone so badly because I wanted to postpone for one day. We even offered to pay them a hotel for the night so that they can still leave when they planned to but they refused.

110,1ev4oyb,AITAH for calling my SIL crazy for stealing my baby names,"So I really would like some advice just to know if I am really overreacting or if this whole situation is as aggravating as I find it to be. So I (F 42) and my husband, Oliver (M 44) got married when we were 26 and 24 and we have four children, together. My husband has a little brother, Mason (M 39) who married Jane (F 34), they have three children together but are expecting a baby.

Me and Jane get along pretty well, her and her kids come over to my house a lot while our husbands are at work so we spend a lot of time together. However there has been one thing that has always bothered me about Jane. A couple years ago when Jane‚Äôs son was being born, she told me that she wanted to name her son Oliver after my husband. Here‚Äôs the problem my son, who was two years old at the time, was already named Oliver after my husband. I expressed this to her, and she then acted like she understood but when her son was born she named him Oliver. 

Mason told me and my husband that they would only call their son by his middle name or by the initials of his first and middle name (ex/ OJ). However for the past ten years, Jane and her kids have only called their son by Oliver. Jane also tries to get her son and my husband to be really close, going as far as to just bring him over to the house by himself a lot, even when she knows my husband and son are trying to spend quality time together. This has always rubbed me and my husband the wrong way but for the sake of his family we chose to just not make it a big deal. 

But flash forward to now, a couple of days ago Jane and me were talking about baby names for her and Mason‚Äôs new baby. For more context, my daughter Annabelle actually doesn‚Äôt get called Annabelle and instead goes by her middle name Lilly. And everyone has been calling her Lilly since childhood not Annabelle.

Well when me and Jane were talking about girl baby names, she said she was already set on a name for a girl and said Lilly. I asked her the reason why, and she stated it‚Äôs the only name that she liked for a girl and that she genuinely didn‚Äôt like any other name. I said to her that she knows my daughter goes by Lilly and that that is basically her name. She instantly got very defensive and tried to say that Lilly wasn‚Äôt my daughters actual name so it didn‚Äôt matter and that I was being ridiculous. I then said, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the ridiculous one and crazy at that.‚Äù This got Jane really mad and she immediately said she couldn‚Äôt believe I called her crazy and then she rounded up her kids and left. 

Honestly I feel like if Jane hadn‚Äôt already done this before, I wouldn‚Äôt have minded her wanting to name her daughter Lilly as much. But twice? It just feels intentional at this point.

However I have been thinking about how I might be overdramatizing this whole situation. I am hestitant because I don‚Äôt want to ruin my husband and children‚Äôs familial relationships with their cousins and brother with this issue.

112,1ev47k1,AITA for yelling at my ungrateful stepson?,"
I‚Äôve been stepmom to my stepson (17M) for the last 4 years. My stepson (who I will call Nick for the post) is a good kid. I love him. As much as I love him we don‚Äôt have the best relationship.

At first, it was easy, I was his Dad‚Äôs new bride and he respected me. We played video games together, cooked together, and went to church together. However, as he grew our relationship soured. The A average he maintained the first 2 years of high school dropped to a B-C average his junior year. He lived with my husband and I 5 days out of the week and I helped him with his school work so this pissed me off especially as someone who is big on grades and college. I asked Nick what was going on and he said he‚Äôs losing his passion for education. I then asked him what he was going to do with his life. To my surprise, he told me he wants to join the USMC infantry. Hell no I said. God forbid he goes to war.

Then there is his mom. I never talked to her all that much except for family gatherings. She isn‚Äôt a pleasant woman to talk to. Recovering alcoholic, emotionless, and uneducated. I can honestly see why Nick lost his passion for school. Nick only sees her on weekends. And she has always talked down on me to Nick. I know because he tells me and says he doesn‚Äôt believe anything she says. Recently though, he has been getting closer with her and I now know he asked her if he could move in with her. This isn‚Äôt a good idea. She‚Äôs a recovering alcoholic with little education and relatively low income. Nicholas has also insulted me a few times. Sometimes repeating the nonsense his mom has said about me. 

Sucks to say it but our relationship has been shitty lately. I was thinking of ways to improve it. His birthday was yesterday. I thought that if I surprised him with a nice new pair of shoes, perhaps he‚Äôd sit down and talk with me. Discuss his feelings with me and our relationship would improve. I did just that but he didn‚Äôt accept my gift. He says he‚Äôs to upset with me to accept anything from me. My husband yelled at him for that. He snapped a bit. Saying that he‚Äôs felt like he‚Äôs ignored at home and that he doesn‚Äôt even consider me family anymore. I nearly cried. My husband then apologized to him for making him feel that way and promised things would change. He then told Nick to go lay down in his room and that he would be there, WITHOUT me to talk about it more. 

I asked Nick to explain himself more to me but he refused. I then asked if we could at least take a family photo together. Him, my husband, my daughter, and myself. He said no. Here is where I yelled at him. I‚Äôve always been fair with him, I bought him shoes and he‚Äôs been treating me like dirt lately. Nick got a visibly sad look on his face and went into his room.

114,1ev40bc,AITA: Pet payments to ex after breakup?,"My ex and I had gotten a cat when we were together. Or he surprised me with the cat - there had been some contemplation of getting a kitten, and I was excited about the idea. So it probably seemed like I was on board, so he surprised me by going out and getting the cat without me knowing.

I loved having the cat. But then long story short my Dad passed and I ended up moving out (my ex and I were living together at the time) and moving home to help with family stuff. We never really discussed pet expenses, I helped out with vet bills that came up, cleaned up and bought food and fed the cat when around, but I was living far away for almost two years. We were in a long distance relationship and the cat stayed with them.

When i moved back to the same city I continued to help out here and there but the cat was still living with them and I wasn't.

About 3 years after we got the cat we broke up. At the time my ex owed me about $600 from a recent trip we'd been on where I covered their expenses - it was obviously a loan and expected to be paid back. And while I don't think there's any easy way to bring up money during a break up, I waited a couple of weeks and then asked about it. 

They got really mad, said money was all I cared about, and then said they shouldn't owe me anything and maybe I should be paying half of the cat's expenses for the next 10 years (or however long).

They never ended up paying me back. To be honest I was so distraught that I just let it go because I thought they were using the money as a way to keep in touch with me (as soon as I said they didn't have to pay me they changed their tune and said of course they would).

Should I have paid for more of the pet expenses? The cat always lived with them and tbh I think I was young and naive about the responsibility of having a pet and it was too late when I realized I did not actually want to own a cat. Which sounds horrible. I pitched in when I was around, but I wasn't around much, for the various reasons above.

I (21F) have a very close group of best friends consisting of Michael (22M) and Lisa (20F), but we also used to have Jonas (21M), Lisa's brother, with us.

We were always very close and did everything together since high school; they know me better than anyone and always support me through the best and worst times. We are truly inseparable. Two years ago, Jonas started dating, and we were all happy for him. We made an effort to get to know his girlfriend, Jessica, and even though she didn‚Äôt seem very interested in us, we tried to include her in the group and in conversations because we knew it would be best for our interactions, and we genuinely wanted to get to know the woman Jonas talked about so much. However, things started to go awry when I started dating, and Jonas began to exhibit behaviors that made me extremely uncomfortable, as well as some comments from his girlfriend that upset me.

We began to have conflicts, but at the time I didn‚Äôt address the issue directly, thinking it was clear why I was upset, given our long history of being inseparable. However, Jonas started distancing himself more and more, treating everyone in our friend group rudely and harshly, especially Lisa, his sister. I understand that relationships can create some distance, but as time went on, he became increasingly distant, to the point of becoming a stranger within his own family.

Since then, two years have passed and our lives have changed completely; Jonas now lives with his girlfriend and they are expecting a child, I have finally graduated from college, and Michael and Lisa practically live together as well. However, Jonas‚Äôs absence from our group has created a void that we have been unable to fill, and we all agree on how much he is missed.

Recently, I‚Äôve tried to find ways to reconnect with him, but I‚Äôve been met with silence. When asked about me, the only things said were that ""he preferred to keep his distance"" and that ""no girlfriend would want her boyfriend to be best friends with someone who had a romantic interest in him,"" even though I am a lesbian and in a wonderful relationship with a woman I plan to marry.

My girlfriend constantly tells me to give up trying to reach out to him, but every time I hear Lisa talk about him, it‚Äôs always stories of how he is depressed and apparently in an abusive relationship, where his girlfriend is constantly rude and passive-aggressive with him, even in front of others. Despite everything, I find myself feeling empathy for him and, even with all his mistakes, I still want to try to help him and at least attempt to address his problems.

Currently, everything about me has a piece of Jonas in it; the language quirks, favorite games, cherished memories, and even movie choices, just as I carry pieces of Michael and Lisa that make me who I am today.

I said absolutely not. I don't know him well enough and I suspect this more about my paying your boyfriend to watch our kid than finding a proper sitter. I don't know how he drives. I don't feel comfortable with him giving him a bath. I don't know how reliable he is. I don't even know if he wants to do it. There are other things about him that I'm not comfortable with. And I pay our sitter good money because he's worth it and has a good relationship with our son. Plus he and I have known each other for like 30 years (we met in middle school!) and would NEVER start a sitter off at $28 an hour.

Also I'm not cool with anyone getting paid to watch my kid while on the clock for another job. The whole idea pissed me off. We got into an argument about it. She insisted that they weren't trying to double-dip on me (they both think I'm rich and they are having money issues). 

We've been fighting over it so I said that I'll take over babysitting stuff. I too WFH and will make it work. She said she didn't want me in her house and then accused me for trying to save money. I said no, this is about you trying to make money off watching our kid. I told her I'm not discussing this until November because it got heated and we have a sitter for another four months. 

Just yesterday she asked if I'd be open to a compromise of her being the ""sitter"" on days or times when I have Sean but need a sitter. I said are you to expect me to pay you? She said yes. I told her no and she's has to drop this ambition of getting paid to watch her own kid. She said could take unpaid time off work and that's why she was suggesting it.

TODAY at 10pm she walked in our house with my nephew and walked out later texting not to lecture her and that she‚Äôd be right back my nephew had no diapers no pants no shoes or socks. just a shirt and a soiled diaper. i called her about 30 times all met with declined calls and her location says shes at home. so i sent her a few texts chewing her out and she said ‚Äúi asked you to babysit and you said no and i have things to do‚Äù her deadbeat boyfriend stays home all day smoking pot and playing games i asked about him and she said ‚Äúi asked one thing stop being selfish ill come back in an hour‚Äù it‚Äôs currently 3am and im tired and my nephew just fell asleep and im wondering if i am being selfish or Exploited. so AITA?

J helped me move on from an abusive and toxic relationship which happened to be the first relationship I ever had. About 3 months after we became friends, we started dating. That didn't last long because we were constantly fighting and he cheated on me more than once in the few months we were together. After some time apart, we decided to be friends again. We were friends for a while before we decided to try dating again. It was hard to be together because we couldn't meet in person until I turned 18 and in my opinion, he couldn't keep it in his pants to save his life. So, we broke up and went back to being just friends.

I wasn't perfect, I'll admit that a lot of our fighting was because I was a jealous 17 year old who knew nothing about healthy relationships let alone how a relationship should go. Anyways, we were both at fault for all of our problems when we dated. I know that I can't blame him for everything not working out because that just wouldn't be true.

Anyways, over the past 4 almost 5 years, we've gone between being just friends and being friends with benefits. Haven't gotten back together or anything.

However, I feel like he only wants to be friends with me for the sex. Anytime I try to talk to him or hang out with him outside of hooking up, he has some excuse not to. I've told him that if I'm just a fuck buddy then he should say that so I can quit putting so much effort into our friendship. He'll tell me how he cares for me and how he doesn't want to lose our friendship and that he won't constantly ask for just hooking up and I stupidly fall for it every time.

122,1ev2gf0,AITA for not inviting my moms side of the family to my wedding?,"I (26F) am getting married in November. We are eloping in california with my parents, sister + bf, and 5 of our close friends. I grew up with my dad‚Äôs side of the family, every holiday, every birthday. we all lived in the same town, so i saw my aunts and uncles, cousins and grandparents regularly. 2 of my dads siblings (who i was extremely close with) died of addiction, and my grandparents have also passed away. we decided to do this elopement style of wedding and have a reception next summer with way more people. our invite list is 150 which literally includes 10 family members combined for both my fianc√® and I. 

my parents 
my sister
my aunt
3 of my cousins 
my finac√®s dad+ brother & sister

i grew up with a lot of ‚Äúfamily friends‚Äù that became family to me. i also have a lot of good friends, from school, college, multiple jobs, and i‚Äôve lived in 3 different states. so we have a large list that is 95% friends. 

my moms brothers have been absolutely horrible to me my whole life. even worse to my dad, and my dads family. my mom is the sweetest, kindest, most caring person on the planet. they bullied her, her whole life. but she will never stand up to them for how they treat us. i ALWAYS have‚Ä¶ my sister is also very passive. i am not‚Ä¶ LOL (i get that from my dads side obviously) 

recently there has been more drama with my uncles because they both live in different states from my parents/ moms mom (who also has treated me like shit my whole life but she‚Äôs in her 80s and not in good health) anyways, my one uncle came to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù my mom clean my grandmas house which needs A LOT of cleaning. my mom can‚Äôt do it all herself, and my dad works full time. my uncle was in town for 15 days and all he did was go golfing with friends and mow the lawn‚Ä¶ my grandma has 2 houses in my home state. the one she lives in currently is about 10 minutes away from my parents house. the PLAN has been for my sister & her boyfriend to get the house when my grandma dies. but my uncle has different plans. anyways that‚Äôs probably a rant for another page BUT back to my original point ‚Ä¶

i told my mom that my fianc√© and i had a rule that we weren‚Äôt meeting anyone for the first time at our wedding. my fianc√© has even less family than i do, because he cut off a lot of them. he hasn‚Äôt met either of my uncles or their families. so i think it‚Äôs wrong to invite them when i literally don‚Äôt even LIKE them.. (well i didn‚Äôt tell her that but she knows i don‚Äôt LOL.) but a few weeks ago she texted me saying my uncle (the one who came to scout out his assets instead of help my mom clean) offered to be my photographer for the wedding. my first thought was, he‚Äôs not even a photographer????? and my second was, why tf did she tell him about the wedding when i told her he isn‚Äôt INVITED?? she replied ‚Äúit‚Äôs my brother i‚Äôll pay for him to be there‚Äù like no no no it‚Äôs not about money it‚Äôs about principle!!!! 

so basically, am i the asshole for not inviting them? it‚Äôs messed up but i legit don‚Äôt even care but i don‚Äôt want to fight with my mom. but i have to set boundaries. i could go on and on about all the vile things they‚Äôve said to me over the years. including im gonna end up just like my aunt and uncle (addicted to drugs and dead) ??? like thanks! 

also maybe 6-8 months ago i posted a tiktok saying we had been pushing off getting married cause we have no family and it makes us sad. then underneath it i said ‚Äúall my family is dead and ******‚Äôs is just sus‚Äù my cousin saw the tiktok (again no relationship with her) and my uncle texted my mom ‚Äúwe dont want to be invited to her wedding anyway‚Äù and got really reallly mad about it.

if im being dramatic and an asshole please tell me. but it‚Äôs not gonna change my mind and invite them‚Ä¶ LOL it‚Äôs more on how do i do this without being an asshole to the women who gave me life and i love more than anything!!! 

ok thanks byeeee

I grew up with my dad‚Äôs side of the family, every holiday, every birthday. we all lived in the same town, so i saw my aunts and uncles, cousins and grandparents regularly. 2 of my dads siblings (who i was extremely close with) died of addiction, and my grandparents have also passed away. we decided to do this elopement style of wedding and have a reception next summer with way more people. our invite list is 150 which literally includes 10 family members combined for both my fianc√® and I. 

my parents 
my sister
my aunt
3 of my cousins 
my finac√®s dad+ brother & sister

i grew up with a lot of ‚Äúfamily friends‚Äù that became family to me. i also have a lot of good friends, from school, college, multiple jobs, and i‚Äôve lived in 3 different states. so we have a large list that is 95% friends. 

my moms brothers have been absolutely horrible to me my whole life. even worse to my dad, and my dads family. my mom is the sweetest, kindest, most caring person on the planet. they bullied her, her whole life. but she will never stand up to them for how they treat us. i ALWAYS have‚Ä¶ my sister is also very passive. i am not‚Ä¶ LOL (i get that from my dads side obviously) 

recently there has been more drama with my uncles because they both live in different states from my parents/ moms mom (who also has treated me like shit my whole life but she‚Äôs in her 80s and not in good health) anyways, my one uncle came to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù my mom clean my grandmas house which needs A LOT of cleaning. my mom can‚Äôt do it all herself, and my dad works full time. my uncle was in town for 15 days and all he did was go golfing with friends and mow the lawn‚Ä¶ my grandma has 2 houses in my home state. the one she lives in currently is about 10 minutes away from my parents house. the PLAN has been for my sister & her boyfriend to get the house when my grandma dies. but my uncle has different plans. anyways that‚Äôs probably a rant for another page BUT back to my original point ‚Ä¶

i told my mom that my fianc√© and i had a rule that we weren‚Äôt meeting anyone for the first time at our wedding. my fianc√© has even less family than i do, because he cut off a lot of them. he hasn‚Äôt met either of my uncles or their families. so i think it‚Äôs wrong to invite them when i literally don‚Äôt even LIKE them.. (well i didn‚Äôt tell her that but she knows i don‚Äôt LOL.) but a few weeks ago she texted me saying my uncle (the one who came to scout out his assets instead of help my mom clean) offered to be my photographer for the wedding. my first thought was, he‚Äôs not even a photographer????? and my second was, why tf did she tell him about the wedding when i told her he isn‚Äôt INVITED?? she replied ‚Äúit‚Äôs my brother i‚Äôll pay for him to be there‚Äù like no no no it‚Äôs not about money it‚Äôs about principle!!!! 

so basically, am i the asshole for not inviting them? it‚Äôs messed up but i legit don‚Äôt even care but i don‚Äôt want to fight with my mom. but i have to set boundaries. i could go on and on about all the vile things they‚Äôve said to me over the years. including im gonna end up just like my aunt and uncle (addicted to drugs and dead) ??? like thanks! 

also maybe 6-8 months ago i posted a tiktok saying we had been pushing off getting married cause we have no family and it makes us sad. then underneath it i said ‚Äúall my family is dead and ******‚Äôs is just sus‚Äù my cousin saw the tiktok (again no relationship with her) and my uncle texted my mom ‚Äúwe dont want to be invited to her wedding anyway‚Äù and got really reallly mad about it.

if im being dramatic and an asshole please tell me. but it‚Äôs not gonna change my mind and invite them‚Ä¶ LOL it‚Äôs more on how do i do this without being an asshole to the women who gave me life and i love more than anything!!! 

ok thanks byeeee

125,1ev23d2,AITA? Neighbor won't turn the music off,"Hi everyone, 

I moved into my apartment complex back in December of 22', and my downstairs neighbor (two story apartment complex) moved in the month after. As far as I can tell, he lives alone and rarely ever leaves his unit. Hes not much older than myself, and I'm in my early-mid twenties. Ever since that first January he moved in, he's constantly playing his music. All his music preferences have heavy basslines, and that mixed with his volume and sound setup make his music constantly shake the floor beneath my feet. I'm not exaggerating either, as I can see water in a glass ripple on my kitchen counter when he plays it. Moreover, it goes on forever. He has left it playing overnight, and through the following day, several times over. 18/24/36 hours straight with no stop. I think he somehow sleeps through it. He also tends to occasionally start yelling incoherently, and he sounds angry, and he'll bang on walls when he does. I've never tried to confront him personally due to this.

For the first couple months I tried to ignore it, but after it continued affecting my sleep and school routines, I tried putting in noise complaints with the apartment office. They kept saying they'd ""look into it."" After a few reports, they told me to call the local private security contractors they had on-site for this. So thats what I did moving forward. When I'd call security, they'd come out, knock on his door, he wouldn't answer, and they'd leave saying there wasn't anything else they could do other than give their report to the office. I am not the only neighbor who has reported him.

 As of today, it's a few months short of two years now that I've had to consistently repeat this process. Occasionally the security contractors or myself have had to call the local pd for a noise complaint when he wouldn't answer to security. Most of the time he also refused to answer for police as well, but the times he did I was informed he was rude and confrontational. I was also informed by one of the officers that he already has several nuisance reports against him.

Today I had another occurance and had pd come out to once again try to get him to turn it off. Surprisingly this time he answered the door to the officer, and instead of being rude like before, he started to tell the officer that Recently he went through some sort of surgery, and the music somehow helps him. I am not going to be the person who denies that could be the case, but I don't understand how that could be the case for nearly two years, or how that kind of information wasn't important enough to bring up until now. He also told the officer that he didn't like how I was loud through the night, because I apparently somehow wake him up when I come home from my overnight job in the mornings. Honestly it all sounds like nitpicking and finger pointing, but the officer seemed to believe him and pity him, so now I look like the Karen in this situation.

I 17F, learned a year ago about family drama. My family, both paternal and maternal, have a lot of history and toxic past. 
My mom recently told me that when she was in college, a bit before she met my father, she had moved out of her parents house (bio mom and step dad). Nothing out of the usual in that case but my grandmother held a grudge because my mom stayed in Paris for her college instead of coming with her to a new town. So, my grandmother allowed my mom to stay at a one bedroom studio with my aunt, who didn't work at the time. She made them pay rent, didn't help with her scholarship (she didn't help any of her bio children she had with my bio grandfather, I don't know why). The problem is not that though. Because I can understand the rent or even not having money to pay for college. But my grandmother asked for an overpriced rent, only gave my mother and aunt fifty euros for both of them to eat for a month, and once the child support and the help from the government stopped coming she asked for even more money. 
My mother had depression because of it and had to work a lot between classes, which made her redo almost every college year at least once. When she met my dad, she was almost anorexic and didn't have appetite. Thank god my father helped her eat more. She had a dental infection because she couldn't afford to bail on her work both in and outside of school and had to go to the er because it was getting serious. My mother told me she already forgave my grandmother and that she is still family and she doesn't want to cut her off, and I respect it.
But now, every time my grandmother complains I can't help but think about this and feel bitter.

When I went to get my My Number card replaced (a type of social security card here in Japan), I was told it costs money so I wanted to go later when I got my cash card or a credit card back and I could do so on my own money, but when I told my husband this, he insisted I do it immediately and said he would borrow me the money to do so.

Fast forward and my cash card arrived and two of my credit cards. We went out for lunch today and he went to pay, so I asked him how much I owed him for my half.

I don‚Äôt mind that he is keeping the tally but when I asked about the 250, he says it‚Äôs for the ATM charge for the 10000¬• he borrowed me. 
I don‚Äôt mind paying that and I understand that it is expensive, but i was very surprised he was counting that closely and told him, I would never think of charging someone for the ATM fee to borrow money I insisted they borrow.
By the way, i have never borrow money from him before, and this is after years of me paying for things for the both of us and his half of meals and him saying he will pay me back later, and ultimately buying me a beer or something here and there and saying, ‚ÄúJust take 300¬• off of what I owe you.‚Äù He does acknowledge this debt and he pays it back in this way, though. I have never considered factoring tax into the things I pay for him or anything, and I cannot imagine a relationship where I would do something like that.
Anyway, when I was surprised, I asked like, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre actually charging me that?‚Äù And he got upset, ‚ÄúBecause ATM‚Äôs are expensive. It‚Äôs not about you, it‚Äôs about them!‚Äù

129,1ev1pv9,AITA for trying to sell a stereo my great uncle gave me ?,"So my great uncle retired recently from his job as news station camera man, he had been living in his mom's house but he wants to move out as he can't afford the repairs on it. So my mom has been helping clean the house and sort everything to sell off to raise money for him at a new place.

My mom wanted help and I agreed to help because I like antiques and old electronics. I worked pretty hard for no pay, until my grandma decided to start paying me, admittedly she did overpay me a little but she said it was interest from the times I worked without expecting anything as a sign of appreciation, again to reiterate I never asked to be paid. Well my mom actually stepped in to stop my grandma from paying me. I had gotten a job recently and I start class again soon so my time is even more limited now but my mom wants me to now work without payment even though my grandma was paying me voluntarily and was happy to do so.

So fast forward one day when I see a stereo(I am not going to say what it is because I don't want to risk identification) and I was looking at it and I asked my great uncle if it still worked, he said ""I think"" and then he said ""do you want it ? Take it"" so I wanted to take it. My mom would not let me, so it sat there no joke behind a door where you could open the door and damage it. It also got dusty when we were scarping carpet foam from off the floor.

I am an audiophile and I know that audiophiles are known for spending a lot of money. So I check the price and I come to find out this stereo sold for 450$ on ebay and that one was in worse condition so I might be able to get even more.

So it just sits there probably getting damaged while I don't have it despite being promised it. Anyways now my mom is mad at me for insisting I get it. She says the reason she won't let me have it is because it's ""unfair to other people in the family"" and that it's ""dishonest"", btw she thought it was worthless and without me would have just given it away to someone else who will sell it. So she wants to sell it at the estate sale, the problem is this is a small town so there are not manty audio enthusiast. What's going to happen is she is going to sell it at a bargain price and someone else will get it.

Look I could maybe understand my mom's point if this was some priceless relic that was worth huge money, but it's 500 dollars. Again he is retired and owns a house I am a neuro divergent individual who is only 20 I just need the money more.

130,1ev1jih,AITA for accepting my sister's decision not to go to hospital post-concussion?,"Good day!

I'll try to keep it brief. My sister has a concussion, circa 2 weeks plus. I want to take her to hospital. I work in healthcare.

We were arguing all day today and I let the personal aspect of our relationship get in the way of the fact she has a literal brain injury. And so, we argued. I took her home and we argued some more while sitting in my car. She asked me to leave because she didn't want me there any longer. I acquiesced and left. She made me promise to call her in a few hours and I did.

Her cognitive abilities are severely diminished and are getting worse everyday.  I am genuinely worried and want to take her to the hospital. After checking in on her she said ""I don't NEED to go ANYWHERE."" I let her know what she is at risk for by refusing to go. She said, in no uncertain terms, that she accepts that. Not wanting to argue further and refusing to beg at that point, I said ""Okay, rest well. Good night."" and hung up my phone.

My kiddo is pissed. Said that if their aunt dies that its my fault. I said, after presenting the risks, my sister made what I think is an informed decision. However, I kinda feel like a jerk due to the cognitive aspect of it all.

AITA?



EDIT: I apologize if I didnt make this more clear. I have fibromyalgia. Stress can trigger flares and I was already suffering from a flare up when my sister called to ask for my help on this day.

We mostly are good together and have the occasional fights, but they do get resolved quickly. We both work full time jobs and we have 2 kids that keep us busy driving them around to various activities after work and during weekends.  

Onto the incident. we have a 2 car garage and we have 2 EVs both new (bought within a week of each other a month ago). Today morning we both took 1 kid each to differnt activities. I reached home first. I connected the EV charger to my car as it was running low. The charger is setup on the wall next to where she parks. I park on the other spot in the garage. When I charge my car, the cable snakes on the floor across her spot to reach my car. 

My wife came back an hour later  with my other kid. I was talking to my kid and he mentioned that we ran over the charging cable. I checked the charging station and the cable was ruined. The cable is hardwired into the station and the station is hardwired into the wall. Now I have to get a new charging station and get an electrician to replace it. I  couldnt believe it and asked my wife if she ran over the charging cable. She said she did, because she did not see it on the floor because she was being careful about the mirrors touching the wall.

I was honestly very annoyed and asked her how she could not see the cable and does she not look at whats on the path in front of her car. She said its not her fault because I didnt tell her I was charging my car. It escalated into a verbal fight and we both are sulking now. 

I am always careful that I dont run over things in the garage as with kids there is always stuff lying around in the garage. What annoys me the most is that she is not even apologetic about it and seems to be believe that its my fault. She also doesnt deal with buying a new charger, scheduling an electrician. She doesnt even know how much these cost.

But I only feel this way because I already feel like we hardly ever have any alone time, anytime I see her it's some big get together with her family or church (I go to church every week with her and her family). So the last thing I wanted is the next time we see each other to be surrounded by a bunch of hedonistic, sweaty concert-goers from 2 artists that are completely out of my style. I told her I will not go and I will not drop her off, but I don't mind if she goes alone with her ""friend"" which I'm not sure who she's referring to.

After this, she begins to tell me how crazy I'm acting. She tells me I'm insecure and controlling because I don't want to go to a concert with her because it's a man. Over and over again she tells me how insecure I am. Now let me be clear, it's not exactly like this, but obviously if you're a man with a girlfriend, you're not gonna be SUPER THRILLED about ""dropping her off"" at a Chris Brown or Usher concert or something. She tells me I'm a controlling, mentally abusive boyfriend for saying no to the concert and that I'm like a ""right wing incel on Twitter who supports Elon Musk"" (not sure how that relates to this, I am not right wing and I do not use Twitter at all). 

My question is, am I the crazy one here? Am I not seeing something that I'm doing wrong here? I just wanna make it clear, I've been in a relationship with her for over 3 year nows, I do everything for this woman. Like I mentioned, I come to church with her every week with her family. I help her out financially as much as physically possible so that she doesn't have to work. I wish I could just come to a resolve about this, but she told me she's on the edge of breaking up with me because I'm mentally abusive for not dropping her off at this rap concert. And honestly, like I said we haven't had much quality alone, date time recently. Almost every single thing we do is with her family or somebody else around. All I want to do is spend some nice quiet time alone with her, so that's another reason I'm not thrilled about this. Am I the wrong one here? Thank you and I appreciate you reading.

I wouldn't say I cancel plans a lot, but there are a few times a year where a chronic illness flare up or panic attack forces me to cancel at the last minute. I take meds, am followed by a doctor, and I'm in therapy so my issues are far from uncontrolled.

My stepsister is coming to town. I wouldn't say we're super close, but she's nice and I like catching up with her. Last time she was here I had a flare up and wasn't able to attend. This time I was fully planning on going until yesterday when I sprained my back, and it left me bedridden. I could barely walk 5 feet without excruciating pain, and so I called my mom [F67] and she was not thrilled that I'd hurt myself, but acted more like it was an imposition than anything else. She kept insisting I could relax on the couch and everything, except our family are Deck People, meaning they like to sit outside so I'd be stuck inside, alone. (They wouldn't be the type to stay inside just because I can't join them on the deck)

I gave it a night to see if I would feel well enough to go if I let my back rest, but when I woke up I was feeling a little better, but not well enough for a family gathering. I called my mom and told her this, and she said ""well, you didn't come last time [stepsister] was in town, so if you cancel this time, it'll look like you're avoiding her."" 

I told her I'm not, and my mom just kept repeating ""well that's what it looks like"" no matter how hard I tried to point out that I didn't hurt my back on purpose, and it's not my fault.

I planned a quick trip to my new city to go apartment hunting. Before the trip I did a lot of research on the area, narrowed it down to my top choices, and then set up tours with those apartment complexes. I asked my mom (45F) to go with me on the trip. We were very close and I thought it would be really nice to spend some quality time together before I moved away. I booked (and paid for) our flights and hotel.

We went on the trip and toured the apartments as planned and everything was going well. After the tours, the choice was pretty easy for me so I was excited to have found an apartment and was looking forward to spending the rest of the trip just having fun. We headed to a restaurant to eat and when we got in the car, my mom jumped on her phone and started googling apartments in the area and suggesting new places to look. I patiently listened to her suggestions, thanked her for her help, and just told her that I really liked the one we already went to so I was just going to go with that one. She continued to google more places. I tried pointing out cool things about the city along the way, but she was so into her phone that she wasn‚Äôt really paying attention. 

We sat down at the table for our meal and she immediately got her phone out and was still looking at apartments in the area.

143,1euzh6p,WIBTAH if I asked my bf to rehome his pup to a family member?,"Update posted at the bottom

I just want to start by saying I don‚Äôt hate the dog, I recognize she‚Äôs only a baby. I just believe she deserves better. Sorry for spelling mistakes or weird format. I am on phone.

My (23F) bf (24M) decided to get a puppy just before he went to school. He told me he had ‚Äúresearched‚Äù the breed, wanted a very specific dog, wanted to do all the things. As someone with dog training experience I agreed and told him I‚Äôd train him to train the dog, but we were gonna need a dog walker while we were working as he works long hours at work, and I work 2 jobs and have my own dog who has far less needs (he is old) and has some pretty serious health issues. 

Bf seemed like he was all about the responsibilities of the dog, the training, its needs and all the dog related things. We get the dog and since then he has basically thrown all of its needs to the wind‚Ä¶ the poor dog is kenneled 90% of their life which drives me crazy even when he‚Äôs on days off, if he does have her out he‚Äôs gaming and not watching them so the coffee table has been chewed up. The potty training was really quite easily but the dog has been having accidents INCLUDING ON THE COUCH! 

My last straw was packing both the dogs up to go on a trip. I went to pack the kennel and bed up and it was completely drenched and smelt so foul. Idk when the dog used the bathroom in the kennel because I have been working 14 hours or more a day (my dog comes with me to work cause I don‚Äôt trust him with my dog due to his health concerns) 

We have talked about this many times before, I‚Äôve cried about, I‚Äôve yelled about, I‚Äôve brought in dog trainers, I set up the dog walker, I have bought 90% of the dog toys, even helped with the vet bills all for him and to help him out. I have even taken ample amounts of time out of my spare time to train/go swimming/camping/walks you name it I‚Äôve done it with the dog. He does barely anything‚Ä¶. Apparently he doesn‚Äôt even walk the dog when he‚Äôs not home‚Ä¶. 

I know the dog deserves so much more than what it‚Äôs getting from him, but I‚Äôm also extremely worried about where the dog goes due to the breed. I don‚Äôt want it to end up as a breeding dog or a fighting dog. Which is why I think it‚Äôd be best to send the dog 8hours away to his family member who have a yard and time and the space (if they want the dog of course) 

The dog is super smart, so willing to work (for food lol) super playful and friendly. They‚Äôre just getting so neglected by someone who gets 14 days of in a row. 

So tell me, WIBTAH? 

Edit to add; I think I WBTAH for trying to make him rehome his dog so I don‚Äôt have to bear the responsibility of it anymore. 

UPDATE!

First of all, thank you to everyone except that one guy who for some reason thinks the dog should stay in her current situation(I‚Äôll forgive you this one time assuming you didn‚Äôt read anything but the title). I appreciate all of your judgements, kind words, advice and most importantly care for the dog in question. I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the genuine concern and care for her from you all that has severely lacked from my ‚Äúpartner‚Äù.

 We talked, I asked him why he wanted the dog, what he was getting from having her here and stuff like that to start the conversation. 
Bf claims he wanted a companion, really wanted the dog and the breed and all of that. He was going on about how on one hand he could keep her and try to do better and blah blah and how on the other hand he could rehome her but I‚Äôd probably just leave him anyways. (I was letting him ramble and just listening to what he has to say) to make a long excruciating conversation that turned into him going on about how he wants to get better but he‚Äôs embarrassing, neglectful, selfish,useless you name it all the degrading words about himself to himself short; I was finally able to say he should call family member and ask if they want the dog and can give her a home. I told him how I felt about his actions towards the dogs and myself as well that I couldn‚Äôt trust him with grocery shopping let alone animal care, that he should never own another animal respectfully but he just is not cut out for it and he didn‚Äôt disagree. 

Anyways I just got to listen to a pity party for an hour about how he‚Äôs mad at himself. I‚Äôm so exhausted from this conversation and guess who has to walk the dog now because he didn‚Äôt take her out before he went to work‚Ä¶. Again :)‚Ä¶.. I would have had to anyways though since he is on nights currently. 

For now she sleeps after her long weekend of running, having fun, swimming and just being a dog. 

As for myself since many were concerned about us breeding/me needing him to care for me in a crisis; I will not be having kids with anyone, for the latter I will cross that bridge once she is safe and happy. Her spay is a month away, she will be having that done. I will be caring for her during the healing process to ensure it goes smoothly and she doesnt get any infections or complications.

Her spay is a month away, she will be having that done. I will be caring for her during the healing process to ensure it goes smoothly and she doesnt get any infections or complications.

I asked about what features she likes in a guy and she told me (tall, broad shoulders, good smile, etc.)

I asked what features she likes on a girl and her answer caught me off guard. She said she actually thinks a baby face is really cute on a girl.

I said that was suprising because most women like women with angular faces while the male gaze tends to be more round faces, etc.

Well, she said angular faces don't do anything for her, she thinks baby faces are cuter. 

I pointed out that she's basically saying she thinks baby features on her women, which is really unhealthy mindset. She clearly has some internalized misogyny. I noticed she didn't say a baby face when we were talking about men.

But yeah, I think it's really creepy to romantice a babies features and want your partner to look like that. But yeah she said I was making something out of nothing and out of line but I do think she needs to do introspection if she finds herself having more of a male gaze and liking youthful women.

145,1euz3wx,AITA for not covering for my best friend‚Äôs drunken night out ?,"This happened around a week ago. My (22F) best friend (28F) called me at 3am to tell me she‚Äôd been out all night with some of her other friends and they‚Äôd been separated. I usually go with her as a DD, but I wasn‚Äôt involved this night.  It was impromptu. They originally meant to go to one bar, but they ended up hopping and going to some of the more wild clubs in the city.

I saw her location on the phone during the call and realized that she was in one of the worst parts of town, a ways from the bars she‚Äôd said she was at. When I asked her where she was going, she said she was going home with her plug. I asked her why she didn‚Äôt just ask her boyfriend for help getting home or one of us, and she said she didn‚Äôt want to bother us. She told me explicitly not to tell her boyfriend what she was doing. 

As you can guess, this is where I am probably the asshole. I called my fianc√© and asked for some perspective. He immediately begged me not to go pick her up and told me to call her boyfriend. My friend was drunk and high on the phone in a different state with a man I didn‚Äôt know, and I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to get her as I don‚Äôt have access to my car, nor would my fianc√© allow me to drive in that area at that time to get her. I tried to find an Uber or a Lyft, but of course no one would service that area at that hour. So, I called her boyfriend hoping he would help her get home or reach out to her and convince her to come home. 

I didn‚Äôt mention that she was with a drug dealer or anything other than she‚Äôd been separated from her friend group and was resting at someone else‚Äôs place and that I couldn‚Äôt go get her. He told me he‚Äôd been trying to get ahold of her since midnight and that she‚Äôd told him she‚Äôd already headed home before then. When I sent him her last known address, he thanked me and hung up. Apparently, all he did end up doing was call her and start a shouting match and accuse her of cheating. She didn‚Äôt get home until mid-morning.

I realize had I not done anything, they may have never fought. I‚Äôve covered for her before, but it was never this serious.

She‚Äôs safe now, but I think it‚Äôs over between us. She doesn‚Äôt call or text, and our last conversation she was rightly angry at me and said she can‚Äôt trust me anymore.

The lot is a typical arrangement of multiple marked rows of cars parked two deep with most facing head-to-head.

152,1eux774,"AITA for ""targeting"" a friend of mine?","
So I (19f) went to an amusement park with friends a couple of weeks ago. This incident has been nagging me, so I thought, why not ask Reddit?

Two girls (18f & 19f), let‚Äôs call them Elsa and Anna, organized the trip. I was the only one with a car and a driver‚Äôs license. My sister (17f) and I provided drinks and dinner, and we had previously asked everyone for gas money (none of us work). Everyone had also brought some snacks.

On the day of the trip, Elsa mentioned that they invited us after another friend couldn‚Äôt make it (she also had a car). Elsa and Anna stuck together throughout the day, even when we agreed on changing who would sit alone. Oftentimes would be on their phones and the pictures taken on the rollercoasters had to ""look good"".

At one point, while standing in line on a hot day, my sister asked Elsa why she was hugging herself, joking that it might make her hotter. Elsa got defensive and accused my sister of being mean all day, which none of us had noticed except for Elsa and Anna. Elsa claimed my sister was being a hypocrite, because my sister would get mad if anyone had said the same thing to her. I tried to clarify, but Elsa wasn‚Äôt having it. Anna sarcastically told me I should be a history teacher because I was so ""knowledgeable."" (Which she told me multiple times throughout the day)

By the end of the day, I offered to buy churros for Elsa and another friend while they went on a ride. They both wanted theirs with ice cream. I bought them but said no ice cream in the car, which I worried might make a mess in the car. Elsa got mad, claiming she wouldn‚Äôt spill anything.

So I (19f) went to an amusement park with friends a couple of weeks ago. This incident has been nagging me, so I thought, why not ask Reddit?

Two girls (18f & 19f), let‚Äôs call them Elsa and Anna, organized the trip. I was the only one with a car and a driver‚Äôs license. My sister (17f) and I provided drinks and dinner, and we had previously asked everyone for gas money (none of us work). Everyone had also brought some snacks.

On the day of the trip, Elsa mentioned that they invited us after another friend couldn‚Äôt make it (she also had a car). Elsa and Anna stuck together throughout the day, even when we agreed on changing who would sit alone. Oftentimes would be on their phones and the pictures taken on the rollercoasters had to ""look good"".

At one point, while standing in line on a hot day, my sister asked Elsa why she was hugging herself, joking that it might make her hotter. Elsa got defensive and accused my sister of being mean all day, which none of us had noticed except for Elsa and Anna. Elsa claimed my sister was being a hypocrite, because my sister would get mad if anyone had said the same thing to her. I tried to clarify, but Elsa wasn‚Äôt having it. Anna sarcastically told me I should be a history teacher because I was so ""knowledgeable."" (Which she told me multiple times throughout the day)

By the end of the day, I offered to buy churros for Elsa and another friend while they went on a ride. They both wanted theirs with ice cream. I bought them but said no ice cream in the car, which I worried might make a mess in the car. Elsa got mad, claiming she wouldn‚Äôt spill anything. The other friend quickly finished hers before getting in.

She did it again anyways, since I was forced to sit with people I never really liked I tried to atleast fit in.

 mom got upset and after the guests left she fought with me and suddenly brought up mistakes I did when I was literally a kid and kept on degrading it and grounded me

I admit it might've been a shitty joke but I gave her a taste of her medicine...Im 100% she'll continue humiliating me infront of people anyways. But was my ""joke"" that bad?

I'm sorry for any grammar mistakes since English is not my first language.

During my work hours, my mother, who volunteered, helps care for my baby. I was initially planning to hire a nanny, but my mother offered to assist.

Now, my mother's sister is back in the hospital, and my other aunts want my mother to care for her. My mother is the eldest of four sisters. The second sister is sick with cancer, the third has a baby she is caring for, and the youngest had heart surgery due to a heart condition.

They all want my mother to look after their sick sister, but she is exhausted and frustrated with their attitudes. Over the years, my mother has always been the one doing everything for them‚Äîcooking during celebrations, cleaning up, and helping with their problems. However, whenever my mother needed help, they were either too busy or had their own issues.

My mother has distanced herself from them, which they have interpreted as selfishness. She just wants to rest and live her life without their interference.

The youngest sister, who is currently helping, has told my mother she can't manage the care due to her heart problems.

160,1euw9d4,AITA For Fat-Shaming & Flaming my Cousin Behind his Back?,"I, 14 Male, have a 12-year-old cousin. We‚Äôve been close since 2015, often talking and playing together. He has a 16-year-old brother whom I prefer more.



In 2019, my family moved to my grandparents' house due to space and rent issues. The move was quick, thanks to a relative with a big truck. After moving, my cousins frequently visited us, which I enjoyed.



During the pandemic, visits stopped. I later learned it was because only my uncle could drive. In 2020, we received an eviction notice because my grandpa's will left the house to my uncle. My dad and aunt spent a lot of time in court that year. By 2021, things were oddly quiet.



In 2024, my parents wanted to visit my uncle, and I was scared. We visited their apartment, greeted by two dogs. My 12-year-old cousin had gained a lot of weight, and their room was a filthy mess. We played Uno, and my cousin kept farting, trying to hide it. Later, he made himself tea and an egg sandwich with ""zaatar.""I'm Arab & I hate my country's language and grammar, so I learned English.



After playing for seven hours, we went home, questioning my cousin's weight gain. Turns out, my uncle started smoking heavily, and my cousin‚Äôs weight gain began during the pandemic due to lack of movement. They visited us recently But Only My Cousins, Not Their Parents. 



Suddenly, My Cousin mishandled my kittens And Kept Loosing Them Outside, claiming my dad gave him permission. I was livid but tried to handle it.



I have three kittens: Choco, Shiro, and Vino. My cousin repeatedly tried to let them outside, so I locked them in a room. He still managed to get them out, so my sister hid the key.



In my room, my cousin farted loudly, so we went outside. We played for a while, then my cousin wanted watermelon. He messed up the kitchen looking for it. I accidentally cut my finger while preparing it for him. Instead of thanking me, he complained it wasn‚Äôt enough.



Back in my room, he farted again for a long time while bouncing on my brother‚Äôs bed to hide the Fart Sounds. The smell was unbearable. We played Hangman, then he went to get water but ended up rummaging through the fridge. I stopped him, but he mocked me, so I locked the kitchen door.



When his family left, I was relieved. While they were here, I made fun of my cousin's weight in English, which he didn‚Äôt understand. I joked about his size because he's very overweight for his age.



This is most of the story, and I‚Äôm tired now. So, am I the asshole for fat-shaming and mocking my 12-year-old cousin behind his back?

162,1euw70h,AITA for calling the police to do a welfare check on my daughter after she said I shouldn't?,"I received a text from my daughter's (25F) ex-fiance (26NB) earlier this evening, saying they were worried for my daughter. That my daughter's wife (30F) had a parental lock on my daughter's phone, was limiting use of that phone and scaring my daughter with extremely controlling ways and potential psychotic breaks (which has happened previously).

My daughter has been telling me everything was fine and they were working on things, but two days ago she told me her wife had asked for three weeks to keep trying, then split if they couldn't work things out (ie, get past general unhappiness). My daughter agreed, but then yesterday texted me while she was at work she was giving me a ""one-week warning"", which meant in a week, she'd be coming back home for however long. This was something I'd offered previously, as I was worried about her welfare.

Then at 5pm today I get the message from her ex and I called and messaged my daughter several times. She finally called back at around 5:20pm saying she had her reasons for lying to me for the past couple of months, and she was just calling me to stop me from potentially coming over as ""it would end badly"". That her wife would only allow her to step outside their apartment door. No, she couldn't make a bolt for it to come to my car if I swung by. No, I shouldn't call the police as again, it would end badly. I wasn't to tell her what she needed to do (response to my saying she needed to leave NOW). Kept reiterating I was NOT to interfere.

My husband was listening to all this and said we needed to call the police. I mulled on this for a minute or so, then did so, requesting a welfare check. At the same time, I got a text from my daughter asking if she could move to my & hubby's place tomorrow, would that be okay. I of course said yes. Hubby suggested her wife may be texting me to try to put me off getting involved. After all, her wife has control of the phone and only unlocks it when she allows my daughter to use her phone.

In the end, I called, 26 minutes after getting the first text from my daughter's ex. The 911 operator said she'd get someone to call round and, as per my instructions, offer to take my daughter then and there to my place. Within 20 minutes I received a call from my daughter, VERY angry I'd called the police to check on her. That I was interfering in things I didn't understand. That she would figure it out. She texted me a little while later to say I needed to stop interfering. I said if she came here after she finished work Monday, I would abide by that.

167,1evnmmo,AITA for not allowing my partner's sister's baby in the wedding?,"For personal reasons I will not be adding sex or gender or age as people involved don't identify and I don't want to get in trouble with them.  

So for some context I am a infant teacher. I am around children for 10-12 hours a day. My partner is not around children much and is very uncomfortable with them especially very young children. 

My partner and I agreed on having a wedding with 21+ in attendance. We have told our guest that we aren't having anyone in or around the wedding who is underage (both families are heavy drinkers and some are know for üçÉ use and I don't feel comfortable with a kid being exposed to that). We also agreed to this because of the budget we set and the amount of people we would want in attendance. 

Now my partner is considering having the baby in the wedding after we had a family meet up and the sister became upset that the wedding is 21+. I may sound like a villain but I work all day with kids. That's the last thing I would want at the wedding. I'm not jealous of the child I'm more so worried about the activities that would be going on around the child and as a mandated reporter I don't want to be put in a bad situation. Plus we already told others that they can't bring their children and now we allow one? What should I do?? AITA for not wanting this??

Edit: I came back on to verify some things. 

1. The parents are both very young (fresh out of college) and are known for getting out of hand at parties. They are both know for drinking and üçÉ usage. This is their first kid and as far as I know the dad is still doing both heavily. They are also known for pushing all of their issues on others and not taking responsibility. I'm afraid that the baby will be pushed off.

2. The baby will be 7 to 8 months old when the wedding comes around. 

3. The state where we reside is a legalize state however it is considered neglectful if a child is brought into this type of situation. I brought up the mandated reporter because I do not feel comfortable having children around these types of things, hence why we agreed on 21+. And if you are a reporter you should then know that if anything is suspicious or neglectful you can report it- not just abuse. 

4. We did offer to pay for a sitter for the baby as well and they told us no. So we did try an alternative instead of them bringing the baby to the wedding. And it wouldn't of been a stranger for sitting. We have cousins/relatives who are 19-20 who also work in childcare and I did offer each of them $20 an hour to watch the baby.

5. The wedding is only 1/2 a day long. Not a whole weekend or three day venture. ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-18,"AITA for not allowing my partner's sister's baby in the wedding? For personal reasons I will not be adding sex or gender or age as people involved don't identify and I don't want to get in trouble with them.  

So for some context I am a infant teacher. I am around children for 10-12 hours a day. My partner is not around children much and is very uncomfortable with them especially very young children. 

My partner and I agreed on having a wedding with 21+ in attendance. We have told our guest that we aren't having anyone in or around the wedding who is underage (both families are heavy drinkers and some are know for üçÉ use and I don't feel comfortable with a kid being exposed to that). We also agreed to this because of the budget we set and the amount of people we would want in attendance. 

Now my partner is considering having the baby in the wedding after we had a family meet up and the sister became upset that the wedding is 21+. I may sound like a villain but I work all day with kids. That's the last thing I would want at the wedding. I'm not jealous of the child I'm more so worried about the activities that would be going on around the child and as a mandated reporter I don't want to be put in a bad situation. Plus we already told others that they can't bring their children and now we allow one? What should I do?? AITA for not wanting this??

Edit: I came back on to verify some things. 

1. The parents are both very young (fresh out of college) and are known for getting out of hand at parties. They are both know for drinking and üçÉ usage. This is their first kid and as far as I know the dad is still doing both heavily. They are also known for pushing all of their issues on others and not taking responsibility. I'm afraid that the baby will be pushed off.

2. The baby will be 7 to 8 months old when the wedding comes around. 

3. The state where we reside is a legalize state however it is considered neglectful if a child is brought into this type of situation. I brought up the mandated reporter because I do not feel comfortable having children around these types of things, hence why we agreed on 21+. And if you are a reporter you should then know that if anything is suspicious or neglectful you can report it- not just abuse.
