0,1ev8b12,AITA for making my bf wear a tie to a black tie event?,"
My boyfriend and I attended my coworker/friend’s wedding last weekend where dress code was black tie. I let him know a couple weeks in advance and he expressed annoyance stating “I never wear ties…I hate wearing ties” and I told him I was very honored to be invited to this wedding as she is someone I care for and respect, and I would be embarrassed if he broke the dress code. Fast forward to the wedding, he wears the tie to the ceremony and is angry the entire time. Doesn’t speak to me and has a terrible look on his face. I cried after the ceremony because I was upset he was acting this way. He said “you care about this wedding than you do my feelings” we talked it out, had a good time at the reception, however I feel like this week he is still sour about it. It’s been a week today and I teased him about how the pictures would have turned out better if he had been in dress code. Apparently that was unacceptable because now he is just as upset as he was at the wedding. I genuinely can’t wrap my head around how he can be this upset about a tie.  AITA?!!!!

Edit: thank you for all your responses. For context, we have been together for almost 3 years (30F, 34M) and this was an isolated event. He really is a good person- very kind, generous, always goes out of his way to make sure I’m happy and taken care of, etc, which was why I was so taken aback by the whole situation. I wanted to come here to gain some perspective regarding this particular incident. Thank you all for giving me a little peace of mind.
