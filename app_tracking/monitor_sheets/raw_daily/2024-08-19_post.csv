0,1ew5x1d,AITA if I do no chores while being living with my mother.,"Obligatory ENG is not my first language.

So me 22 ftm live with my mother, ever since I can remember every time I have tried to help with chores or with anything important I get yelled at, or she gets annoyed at me. However, when I don't do any chores, she tells me that I would be a failure of a housewife and that I must learn to do household chores for my future husband. (unsure where that comes from, I find myself to be quite good at both cleaning and cooking)

The point is, I think I might be the asshole because I contribute nothing and just freeload doing homework and gaming all day.

  
Edit: I'm quite good at both cooking and cleaning because I legitimately got raised by a maid my mother hired to take care of me. I know how to clean cook do embroidery and sow. (my ability to do the chores is not part of the issue). Sorry if I worded in a weird way",POO Mode Activated ðŸ’©,2024-08-19,"AITA if I do no chores while being living with my mother.
