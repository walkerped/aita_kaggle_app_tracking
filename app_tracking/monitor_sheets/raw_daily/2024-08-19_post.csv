0,1ew5x1d,AITA if I do no chores while being living with my mother.,"Obligatory ENG is not my first language.

So me 22 ftm live with my mother, ever since I can remember every time I have tried to help with chores or with anything important I get yelled at, or she gets annoyed at me. However, when I don't do any chores, she tells me that I would be a failure of a housewife and that I must learn to do household chores for my future husband. (unsure where that comes from, I find myself to be quite good at both cleaning and cooking)

The point is, I think I might be the asshole because I contribute nothing and just freeload doing homework and gaming all day.

  
Edit: I'm quite good at both cooking and cleaning because I legitimately got raised by a maid my mother hired to take care of me. I know how to clean cook do embroidery and sow. (my ability to do the chores is not part of the issue). Sorry if I worded in a weird way",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-08-19,"AITA if I do no chores while being living with my mother.

I have been arguing with my husband because I asked him if he wanted to go to the water park for a special occasion, however our finances have been tight but I figured it would be $100 and a fun way to beat the heat.

3,1ewg7be,AITA for complaining that my bf's mum is moving into the house we were supposed to move into?,"Throwaway account because I don’t want anyone I know finding this.

I (28F) have been with my boyfriend (29M) for a year and a half. We’ve had a solid relationship so far, and we were planning to take the next step and move in together. I currently live with my best friend, who’s also my flatmate, but she’s moving back to her hometown soon. Since I’ve been made redundant from my last two jobs and can't afford the rent on my own for a 3-bedroom, 3-bathroom flat, I have to move out too.

My boyfriend’s parents aren’t exactly wealthy, but they own four properties, all of which were occupied (3 of them by friends and family -one of them by my BF's brother- and the other one is the main family home). His brother recently bought a house, and the plan was for my boyfriend and me to move into the property where we used to live, together. We had agreed to move in by July, and I’ve been really excited about it, especially since it’ll be our first time living together. 

However, my boyfriend’s family is a bit sketchy. They have some weird/funny businesses that he’s never really explained to me, and I’ve always found it a little odd that he won’t talk about it. His mum is also kind of strange with me—she’s polite but there’s this underlying tension that I can’t quite put my finger on.

Last week, my boyfriend’s dad sadly passed away after a long battle with cancer. I’ve tried to be supportive, but I haven’t been able to see my boyfriend all week. I get that he’s grieving, but with only two weeks left before we’re supposed to move in together, I think we should be planning things out. There’s so much to organize, and I’m feeling really anxious about the situation.

Today, we had lunch with his mum, and she dropped a bomb: she’s going to be moving into the house we were supposed to live in. She said she can’t bear to stay in the house where her husband died, which I get, but it still feels incredibly rude to pull the rug out from under us like this, especially so last minute.

I told my boyfriend how upset I was about this, and he completely flipped on me. He said I was being unfair and selfish, and we ended up having a huge argument. He accused me of not understanding what his mum is going through, but I feel like no one is considering how this affects me. Now, I’m left scrambling to find a new place, and I’m honestly hurt that my boyfriend doesn’t seem to care about how this impacts our plans.

5,1ewfm5v,AITA for asking my girlfriend to give me more notice before coming to my place due to my ADHD?,"I have untreated adult ADHD. While not officially diagnosed, my doctor and I came to this conclusion before I moved. My ADHD affects my time management and I'm a great procrastinator.

My girlfriend is very punctual. This has been an ongoing issue between us. She usually tells me in advance when she's coming over, sometimes even a day ahead.

Recently, she told me the night before that she had the next day off and would come over between 10-11 AM. At 10:30 AM, she texted that she was leaving. I replied, ""Hey, take your time. I still haven't picked up or gotten ready yet.""

Some context: I live alone and get messy when she's not around (laundry out, dishes in sink, pizza box left out). Usually, I clean up during her 20-minute drive, but this time I felt tight on time.

Her reaction: ""Oh, you always do this,"" ""I'm sick of this, you need to figure it out."" She ended up not coming over.

We argued back and forth. I said, ""I've always been like this, why is it fair for you to ask me to change?"" She replied, ""It's not that hard to change this one thing,"" knowing I've struggled with time management.

I asked if she could give me a same-day, one-hour notice before leaving, as I only seem to act in the moment. Future plans don't concern me until they're right there, and I often realize, ""Oh my god, 2 hours have gone by. I haven't done anything.""

She's refusing to give me more of a heads up, saying she shouldn't have to. I feel like I'm just asking her as my partner to help me out by doing this one thing.

8,1ewemar,AITA for trying to get my sister to break up with her boyfriend ,"Looking for advice and some perspective.
 
I 22nb am trying to encourage my sister 18f to break up with her boyfriend 23m. Let’s call my sister H and her boyfriend R. Sorry for any formatting issues I am on mobile. 

For my own wellbeing, I wish I could just turn a blind eye in this situation. However, I physically cant sit by and watch my sister date a creep. We come from a small rural town. When I was 18 I moved 3 hours away to the nearest big city. My sister is still at home with our mom. For the past year, my sister has been hiding from me who she is dating, and that she is dating anyone at all. I think this is because she knows I would not approve.

H met R on tinder. This is the first red flag for me. Not because I have anything against tinder, but because R lives FOUR HOURS away from H. Why did this 23 year old adult man have to crank his tinder distance THAT far just to find a freshly 18 year old girl in a town of 200? This is giving me major creeper vibes. My sister was still in high school when they started dating. This age gap is very disturbing to me. 

About a month ago, my sister told me that he was off to the military. This was surprising to me but I was very relieved that he was leaving. Apparently he was really depressed and he signed himself up for the military and “didn’t think they would take him”. I told my sister this was a great opportunity to break up and find someone her age. She has been receptive to my concerns and has told me she appreciates that I care about her so much, but stands firm in her stance that this is a perfectly normal relationship. I totally disagree. 

They have been writing letters back and forth ever since he left. Today, H sent me a message and told me she was going to drive to Oklahoma (a 14 hour trip) BY HERSELF to go visit him. She asked me to be supportive but I just can’t be. I told her that I will always be there for her, but that’s not the same thing as being a yes-man. I love her and I don’t want anything bad to happen to her. I feel like this goes beyond my normal protective older sibling duties. I feel like this this a potentially dangerous situation that my sister is in and I want to get her out.

I went to my sisters high school graduation this spring and I was sick to my stomach. As a 22 year old I looked around at these 18 year olds and they looked like literal babies to me. I could never imagine myself looking at them in that way, and the fact that this 23 year old man found one four hours away from the big city he lives in is GROSS to me. 

I’ve been trying to convince her to not take the trip and break up with him. She thinks I am an asshole for not seeing her as “adult enough” to be in a relationship. That is not the case at all! In my opinion, there’s no amount of maturity in the world that would make this relationship okay. But maybe I am meddling too much in her life, I’m just so worried about her. What do you think, Reddit? Am I the asshole here? 

Edit :

A lot of people have asked for more of a reason why I dislike him aside from the age gap alone. Here is more context.

When they first started dating, my sister lied to me and told me he was 20. I found out he was 23 and asked her why she lied to me. She told me she lied because she knew it was weird and she didn’t want me to worry. She said that because they were only talking and not in a committed relationship that it was okay. Me and my sister and best friends, lying is not normal for us. 

My sister told me that when they first started dating he would say things like “you’re so mature for your age”, “I feel like a predator dating a girl so young, but you’re different, you’re so mature” etc. He would make her reassure him that he isn’t a predator. If that doesn’t send a shiver down your spine I don’t know what will. He hasn’t met any of my family. He made my sister drive the full 4 hours to see him, (across state lines) every time they would see each other. He told her that he doesn’t want to meet us because “they’ll be judgmental, they won’t understand us”. This is grooming language. Whether that’s what he’s trying to do or not. 

I admit that he hasn’t done anything besides this, and yes I haven’t met him, because he won’t meet me or any of my family. I don’t have any respect for a man who would peruse a young girl still in high school at the time. It is always the responsibility of the older participant in any older/younger dynamic to shut it down. The fact that he would make comments about it to her and that he won’t show his face to my family proves to me that he knows he is being slimy. There are clear red flags when it comes to his behavior and some of you people in the comments who are rushing to defend him need to have your hard drives checked. 

I have been accused of being judgmental and jealous of my sister. This is not the case at all. I trust that my sister will make the right decision in a dangerous situation, I just don’t want her to have to be in the dangerous situation at all. I don’t look down at her, I just know what it’s like to be 18 and naive. That’s not to say there’s anything wrong with that. Everyone can be naive. I’m still naive to things that people older than me have lived through and experienced. If I got advice from a worried older cousin I wouldn’t think I was being looked down upon. 

I did read the level headed comments, though. I understand that I should not push her into breaking up. Our mom doesn’t really do the job of “mom”. I took the reins a lot growing up. I care for my sister a lot, but I know I can’t make decisions for her. Sometimes I get so caught up as a 3rd party watching my sister get no help or guidance from my mom and my instincts to step in kick in. While I will never approve of the relationship, I will hold my tongue. I won’t say I told you so if things end badly. I will be there for her no matter what. I don’t want to push her so far into his arms that she feels like she doesn’t have anyone to go to besides him. 

I understand that I am the asshole for pushing, I won’t do that anymore. But I will never quit being worried for her and keeping tabs on this guy. You’ll will never convince me that he doesn’t have any red flags. And if you believe that his behavior is normal, I don’t trust you around my young cousins…",No A-holes here,2024-08-19,"AITA for trying to get my sister to break up with her boyfriend  Looking for advice and some perspective.

My sister told me that when they first started dating he would say things like “you’re so mature for your age”, “I feel like a predator dating a girl so young, but you’re different, you’re so mature” etc. He would make her reassure him that he isn’t a predator. If that doesn’t send a shiver down your spine I don’t know what will. He hasn’t met any of my family. He made my sister drive the full 4 hours to see him, (across state lines) every time they would see each other. He told her that he doesn’t want to meet us because “they’ll be judgmental, they won’t understand us”. This is grooming language. Whether that’s what he’s trying to do or not. 

I admit that he hasn’t done anything besides this, and yes I haven’t met him, because he won’t meet me or any of my family. I don’t have any respect for a man who would peruse a young girl still in high school at the time. It is always the responsibility of the older participant in any older/younger dynamic to shut it down. The fact that he would make comments about it to her and that he won’t show his face to my family proves to me that he knows he is being slimy. There are clear red flags when it comes to his behavior and some of you people in the comments who are rushing to defend him need to have your hard drives checked. 

I have been accused of being judgmental and jealous of my sister. This is not the case at all. I trust that my sister will make the right decision in a dangerous situation, I just don’t want her to have to be in the dangerous situation at all. I don’t look down at her, I just know what it’s like to be 18 and naive. That’s not to say there’s anything wrong with that. Everyone can be naive. I’m still naive to things that people older than me have lived through and experienced. If I got advice from a worried older cousin I wouldn’t think I was being looked down upon. 

I did read the level headed comments, though. I understand that I should not push her into breaking up. Our mom doesn’t really do the job of “mom”. I took the reins a lot growing up. I care for my sister a lot, but I know I can’t make decisions for her. Sometimes I get so caught up as a 3rd party watching my sister get no help or guidance from my mom and my instincts to step in kick in. While I will never approve of the relationship, I will hold my tongue. I won’t say I told you so if things end badly. I will be there for her no matter what. I don’t want to push her so far into his arms that she feels like she doesn’t have anyone to go to besides him. 

I understand that I am the asshole for pushing, I won’t do that anymore. But I will never quit being worried for her and keeping tabs on this guy. You’ll will never convince me that he doesn’t have any red flags. And if you believe that his behavior is normal, I don’t trust you around my young cousins…",4.0,1.0624223947525024,1,0

I know that she already smokes, so it probably wouldn't be *that* bad, but still, it just felt wrong to me.

11,1ewdtt1,AITA for skipping my boss’ Labor Day Cookout?,"My boss has a very nice beach house on Lake Michigan and every year he invites the management (including me) and his friends to a cookout on the Saturday of Labor Day weekend. It’s a nice gesture, but it’s also about an hour away from our work and home (on a normal day) and more like 2 hours with Labor Day weekend traffic. Worst of all, it’s smack in the middle of a long weekend, and I truly value my family time (I have 3 kids under age 10). I am allowed to bring my wife, but not the children, so it’s even more of an imposition to find childcare.

I feel somewhat obligated to attend. He’s usually pretty insensitive about throwing get togethers near holiday schedules. Case in point, last year he had a party on the day before Thanksgiving, and routinely invites people to Christmas Eve at his house (I actually showed up my first year with the company). I think it’s because he genuinely likes hosting parties and doesn’t have a family or kids of his own. It’s nice of him, but I’d honestly rather be with my own family instead. Even if I do something lame like trimming the bushes or yard work, I’d enjoy it more than this cookout.

Finally the crowd at the parties/cookout is usually a bunch of my boss’ wealthy friends from his gated community. I find most of these people to be annoying/insufferable with a few exceptions.

They met a year later and became ""widowed parent friends"" which I always believe they started dating like a year after my mom/stepsister's dad died but they don't want to be honest and say they moved on so fast, especially when they had kids. So we'd all hang out together during the day and we'd have late nights at each other's houses for a couple of years. Even back then I struggled to get along with my stepsister. She was always a sensitive kid. She was shy, quiet, very delicate to any kind of negativity or being corrected. I'm quiet and introverted so similar. But I was supposed to be her best friend (said my dad) and to be gentle with her, be there for her, help her with stuff, make her laugh. It was annoying back then and when my dad and stepmom admitted they were dating I really hated that I was now stuck with her. She stuck to me in school and would track me down and follow me around. My dad told me I should love having a sister my age. I told him I didn't. He told me to think about how great it could be. I told him I wanted to spend time with friends without her. He said she was my best friend.

She never could make her own friends. She's very hard to get close to. She hardly talks. She'll talk if it's just us but it's so painful. She never wants to do anything and just follows me around.

Then our half siblings were born and it was a shitshow. I love my half siblings. It was clear I loved them but not my stepsister. My stepmom made that a very big deal and told me I shouldn't love some siblings more than others, I should love everyone. She also accused me of turning my half siblings against my stepsister.

18,1ewc1tb,AITA for getting involved in a fight between my dad and his wife and making it worse?,"My dad and his wife of 2 years got into a fight last week. His wife told him he wasn't being a good father to her son (6) and that she was tired of him spending time with him and then dropping him for me. That he should be consistent with her son who already lost one dad and didn't need to lose the dad he'd remember. Dad argued that he was juggling two kids and that I (17m) needed him more than ever right now because my mom was never going to get better. Mom was in an accident and she's got severe brain damage. They said she will need around the clock care for the rest of her life. Dad's wife said none of that was an excuse to make her son question if he still loved him.

She told dad I already make him feel unwanted because I have never wanted to be his brother. That I have shown *so much jealousy* that dad has taken responsibility for another kid. And now dad is making all of that so much worse. She's not wrong that I have never wanted to be her son's brother.

My parents broke up when I was 3. My mom was the parent I spent the most time with. I saw dad on weekends. He was not a consistent dad. Sometimes he was fine, other times he sucked, he let me down a lot, but he also told me he never wanted to lose me a lot. When I was younger I opened up to dad one time that I was scared he would just stop being a good dad to me, that he'd replace me like some of my friends were replaced by their remarried parents. I told him I never wanted him to be a better dad to some other kid over me. Dad assured me it would never happen and I'd always be his number one. Three years ago that conversation was stupid in my head because I realized he'd never be a good dad for real.

He started dating his wife 4 years ago, moved her in because Covid, and I didn't see him for over a year because of Covid. My mom had her accident a few months ago and I moved in with them which was the first time I really spent any time with his wife or her son. My dad was real weird after I moved in. At first it was like he didn't even remember I was there and then when I spent a few days at a friends house he freaked out and told me he'd thought I wasn't coming home. I told him I didn't see a point in being there. So he spent a bunch of time with me and now he flip flops between me and his wife's son.

Dad told me a month and a half ago that if I ever wanted him to choose between me and his wife's son, he'd always pick me, he'd forget the other kid existed. I rolled my eyes at him because I found it crazy and I didn't really believe him.

During the fight she said all this shit about me and mom. She told dad he was a better dad before I moved in. So I told her what he said about choosing me if I made him choose. Shit hit the fan and of course she got so loud her son heard and I was blamed for that. She called me a monster, told my dad he said he loved her son and how could he do that to her boy. Now every time I pass her in the house she tells me I'm a monster.

When I was younger I opened up to dad one time that I was scared he would just stop being a good dad to me, that he'd replace me like some of my friends were replaced by their remarried parents. I told him I never wanted him to be a better dad to some other kid over me. Dad assured me it would never happen and I'd always be his number one. Three years ago that conversation was stupid in my head because I realized he'd never be a good dad for real.

He started dating his wife 4 years ago, moved her in because Covid, and I didn't see him for over a year because of Covid. My mom had her accident a few months ago and I moved in with them which was the first time I really spent any time with his wife or her son. My dad was real weird after I moved in. At first it was like he didn't even remember I was there and then when I spent a few days at a friends house he freaked out and told me he'd thought I wasn't coming home. I told him I didn't see a point in being there. So he spent a bunch of time with me and now he flip flops between me and his wife's son.

Dad told me a month and a half ago that if I ever wanted him to choose between me and his wife's son, he'd always pick me, he'd forget the other kid existed. I rolled my eyes at him because I found it crazy and I didn't really believe him.

During the fight she said all this shit about me and mom. She told dad he was a better dad before I moved in. So I told her what he said about choosing me if I made him choose. Shit hit the fan and of course she got so loud her son heard and I was blamed for that. She called me a monster, told my dad he said he loved her son and how could he do that to her boy. Now every time I pass her in the house she tells me I'm a monster.

19,1ewbved,AITA for not telling my friends about my other friends grandmother?,"My friend Kira and I are both part of two friend groups in college. A few days ago Kira texted the friend group we're both closest with that she was in the hospital with her grandmother that was dying.

Today, our friend Lila from our other friend group texted me and our friends Annie and Zoe, not Kira, that her grandmother had passed. She was trying to make plans with Kira and she had told her she was busy with funeral plans. Annie asked when, and I mentioned that Kira told me she was in the hospital with her the other day but I don't know when exactly she passed. I got no response.

Annie texted me separately a few minutes later asking why I didn't say anything about Kira's grandmother. I told her that I didn't think it was my place to tell other people about something Kira didn't even want to talk about herself, and Annie said that just because Kira and I are in both friend groups doesn't mean I'm allowed to gatekeep (she used that word) things from one group to another.

I told her it wasn't my intention, I just wasn't the type of person to air out other peoples problems unprompted. Annie called me rude for basically implying that Lila did something wrong for telling us Kira's grandmother died, and I said that wasn't what I meant at all.

20,1ewbqg7,WIBTA for not taking my friend’s shift? ,"I (F18) work at a restaurant with my friend Olivia (F18). 

Olivia and I went out this past Saturday night and I paid for the uber there and back, which she said she’d pay me back half for. (We don’t live in the downtown city where the bars are so it’s pretty pricy.) 

The next day she had to leave early because she was going to a country concert three hours away with her family but had a shift on Monday so she’d only be spending a day there. 

Yesterday I texted her reminding her if she could please send the money, she said she was too drunk and she’d send it later which was fine. Then Olivia sent me a text asking if I could take her monday shift because she won’t be back in time the day of. 

I agreed if she swapped a shift with me and sent me the money she owes me. She said yes and we made a deal.

Although she literally still hasn’t sent the money yet at all and I’m supposed to work for her in a few hours. I’m refusing to accept the shift in the scheduling app unless she sends me the money she owes me. 

She ended up taking a nap and hasn’t replied all day to me today. I’m not planning on showing up unless she sends me it — which literally takes seconds to do. 

My other friend says I’m being cheap but I know she hasn’t paid a friend of mine back for money either. I know she could possibly get in big trouble for missing it and I did technically agree to swap with her.

Edit : I also forgot to mention Monday (today) was my only day off this entire week.

With two young kids and both of us working full-time, we obviously don't get a lot of time for ourselves and even less for the two of us as a couple.  We've had maybe 2 ""dates"" since our youngest was born. My wife has at least been able to attend a couple of her friends' weddings, but I haven't had social time just for myself in probably 6-months.  

My wife has been lamenting our lack of social lives and asked me to plan something for us to do as a couple because she doesn't have the mental energy for it.  A few weeks ago I saw that one of her favorite bands is playing a show in a town we used to live in before we got married. We still have friends there so I reached out to them to see if they would want to attend the show with us.  They agreed and even offered for my wife and I to stay with them for a night so we wouldn't have to drive home after the show.  

I told my wife about it and instead of being happy or excited, she immediately went off about how we have no one to watch the kids, we've never both been away from them for a night, etc.  I told her that I had already asked my parents to come stay with the kids for a night and they were excited for it.  But my wife kept going off about how our kids haven't been sleeping well, what if X, Y, or Z happens, etc.  

I did my best to calm her down and asked her if I should just cancel the whole thing because it doesn't sound like she's on board with my idea.  She said she wants to do it, but she's just worried about leaving the kids for a night.  I told her that this plan is literally exactly what she asked me to do but if she doesn't want to do it, then we can cancel.  She again said she didn't want to cancel.

Well, the concert was this past Saturday.  My parents arrived Friday so that they could have a night with us and the kids at home to get familiar with our routine.  Everything went fine that night.  But, the next day as we were getting things packed up and ready to go, my wife became hesitant.  Instead of packing, she was running around asking my mom and dad a bunch of questions related to the kids.  I tried to get her to focus on the concert and seeing friends, but I couldn't do it.

Eventually, I asked her if she still wanted to go.  She said she wasn't sure.  She told me she was feeling guilty about leaving the kids overnight.  I told her that we both need to have time for us to behave like adults, and this is our chance.  She then told me that I should just go by myself because she doesn't think she will enjoy herself.  

So, that's what I did.  I went and saw friends and spent the night and had a great time.  When I got home the next day, my wife was upset with me.

33M here, and I’m caught in the middle of a family conflict involving my sister (28F) and my brother (36M).

My sister is getting married next year and wants a lavish wedding. However, she doesn’t have enough savings to cover all the expenses. She recently asked (more like insisted/expected) that our brother pay for a significant portion of her wedding, arguing that he has a well-paying job and can afford it. (N.B. My brother  made some good investments and cofounded a business which has really kicked off).

When I heard about this, I intervened and told my sister that it’s unfair to expect our brother to pay for her wedding. I suggested that she either scale down her plans or find other ways to finance it. This led to a huge argument. My sister accused me of not supporting her and being selfish. My mom sided with her, saying that family should help each other out and stick together. 

As I was so frustrated I then started an additional argument accusing my mom of spoiling my sister and always taking her side, caving into whatever she asks for and this is why she feels its ok to ask my brother to pay for the wedding.

My parents know I stayed with him at his apartment for almost a week before I came home for the summer and had no qualms about it. Which is why when he told me he wanted to come visit (which my parents both offered him when they met him), I thought it would be a given that he would stay in my room with me. (I want to make it clear even before all this was brought up we had no intention of getting intimate with my parents around) I had never gotten the impression from my parents that they felt strongly about traditional approaches to dating (I knew they had lived together before marriage and all that) but apparently I was wrong about that.  

At lunch the other day my dad (56M) broached the topic saying my boyfriend would have to stay in my brother's room while he is here with us. He said that otherwise it would be ""disrespectful to him (my dad)"", that even though he ""knows we are together"", ""he doesn't want to see that"" and that it would make him uncomfortable. I was a irritated with this and asked what part of two adults in a committed relationship wanting to stay together was disrespectful to him. After that he took the tone he saves for when he lays down the law and said that ""it just isn't how things are done"" and ended the conversation.

But last year I told dad I was only going to visit for a week vacation and come back home again. He was upset but he said he was fine with it, but he wanted me to spend some time with his partner and her son. When I got to dad's house, his girlfriends son was in the hospital so I didn't meet them. Dad was upset and wanted me to stay but I wanted to get back home and get back to work. I went to visit for one weekend again this year. This year he married his girlfriend... who's now his wife I guess. So he asked me to change the date I was planning to come. I visited the second week of June. But his stepson's birthday is in July and he wanted me to be here. I already had plans made for July and told dad. Then his mother in-law died the day before I was due to fly out so dad had the choice of me cancelling so he could be with his wife and her son or whether he would stay behind and I'd fly out. He decided to stay so he could see me. He was disappointed I still didn't meet his wife or her son, but especially her son, who turned 8 in July.

My dad brought up his stepson's birthday to me after I flew back. I asked him why he kept talking about it and he said he'd love to fly me out for the day, so I could come to the party, meet his family, get to know my sibling. I told my dad his stepson isn't my sibling. We're still strangers. And we'll never be close. I told him I'm not going to move closer to them when I finish school. I told him I'm not going to invite them all to stay with me. We'll see each other occasionally but they won't be a big part of my life. I reminded him he chose to move and not be a big part of my life. Dad said he had his reasons and I should embrace the chance to have a sibling. I said no thanks.

He bought a plane ticket for me for the day of the birthday party. Sent it two days before. He told me to please come. I told him I wasn't coming. He even showed up to the airport with his stepson to wait for me. His wife joined them. I didn't come.

Ever since dad has been really pissy when we talk on the phone. He told me he can't understand me not making the effort. He said it would have meant the world to them. He also told me I had no real reason not to come, other than I don't want to make an effort for us to be a family and it makes him sad. He also said his stepson and wife had been so excited to meet me.

Ever since dad has been really pissy when we talk on the phone. He told me he can't understand me not making the effort. He said it would have meant the world to them. He also told me I had no real reason not to come, other than I don't want to make an effort for us to be a family and it makes him sad. He also said his stepson and wife had been so excited to meet me.

27,1ewb2qe,AITA for Not Inviting Certain Relatives to Our Wedding?,"
I (37F) recently married my amazing husband (26M), and I’m still on cloud nine. He’s everything I could’ve ever asked for—kind, supportive, and he treats me like a goddess. We’ve been together for over two years, and even though I initially hesitated to date him because of our age difference, he never gave up. He’s always loved older women and made it clear that he was serious about me from the start.

One night, while we were cuddling in bed, he jokingly said, “We should just get married.” I looked at him and said, “Let’s do it.” It wasn’t a grand proposal, but it was perfect for us. The next day, we went out and bought our rings together, making it official right then and there. Neither of us wanted a big wedding—we just wanted to be husband and wife.

So, we kept the ceremony small and intimate, inviting only our closest friends and family members who had always supported our relationship. However, there were a few relatives who had made it clear they thought our relationship was ""weird"" because of the age difference. We decided not to invite them because we didn’t want any negativity on our special day.

Now, those relatives have found out about the wedding and are upset that they weren’t invited. They’ve accused us of being disrespectful and hurtful for excluding them. I’m starting to wonder if we were wrong to leave them out. Maybe we were being petty by not inviting them, but I just wanted the day to be perfect for both of us.

29,1ewaueb,AITA for chastising my friend for not supporting his wife and child?,"I, 22 F, have been friends with this couple for over six years. Let's call them Jack and Jill. In high school, I knew them both separately and had important friendships with them both individually. Eventually, they started dating, got married, and a year ago had a little boy, whom I love so so much. I am his godmother, and I view Jack and Jill as family. 

Neither Jack or Jill went to college, but Jill works as a hairstylist, and Jack works in construction. Or should be working in construction. As such, their financial situation isn't great. They got married very young and currently live in a one bedroom basement apartment. They are on WIC and other government support. It has been hard for me to watch.

Jack grew up in a very disjointed household, and this has affected the way he responds to emotional conflict, which is important to note as we go forward. Recently, I've noticed more and more laziness on his end. He games with his friends constantly, quit his job because he didn't like it, and works only occasionally with family on various projects. Nothing steady. He helps with the baby, but sleeps a lot and is pretty casual about helping with household chores. Jill has had to pick up a lot of slack.

Two months ago, Jill called me up to tell me how frustrated she was with Jack and their financial situation. She told me that Jack isn't putting in effort to work for their family, and that her parents and other confidants have advised divorce, or at least the threat of it to get him off of his ass. The conversation didn't really take me by surprise, but it was the last straw. I know they love each other more than anything, and a divorce seems rash to me, so I decided to call him.

Before calling, I told Jill of what I was planning, and she told me she was totally fine with whatever I decided to do. It should also be noted that I try very hard to stay out of marital issues between the two. It's really none of my business. Until now. I called him and told him he needed to start working his ass off and get a true 9-5 job. I told him that he was going to lose Jill and his baby if he didn't start putting in the effort, and that I was disappointed in him. I told him I loved him and his family very much, and I really didn't want to see anything bad happen to them. 

The conversation was brief, and he didn't really respond to anything. I told him to take his time to process, and call me back when he was ready. He has since refused contact with me for two months. I still have a great relationship with Jill and speak with her frequently, but she has stayed out of my conflict with Jack. At this point, I'm feeling incredibly frustrated. I only called him because I care about both him and Jill, and my godson.  After being reassured by Jack throughout our friendship that I was family, it seems particularly childish to cut me off because of one conversation that didn't go as he liked.

I've never used Reddit before, so I'm sorry if this is worded weird or anything and sorry if this is overly long. So, for context, I am 15 F and most people in my friend group are around the same age. We live in a small town in which most of us grew up in. Most of us have known eachother since kindergarten, we're now in high school. So, my one friend, who we will call Robyn changed her name around 3-4 years ago. Robyn comes from a pretty conservative family, and she's struggled with gender and sexuality for a while. She isn't transgender or anything, but she just isn't comfortable with her old name. She doesn't expect everyone to use her 'new' name, she just tells friends and family. She uses her 'new' name on all of her social media's. I've known Robyn since I was in first grade, and personally I've had no problem adjusting to calling her by her preferred name (as it's been 3-4 years now since she's changed it.) Some of our other friends completely disregard her 'new' name. Robyn never makes a fuss about it, she just lets it slide but she tells me that it really hurts her, and that she doesn't understand why our close friends can't use her name but other acquaintances and classmates have no issue. It breaks my heart to see Robyn go through this. I've been trying to correct them, but they really do not care. She told me when next school year starts, (as it's currently summer) she's going to be distancing herself from a lot of people, which I think is fair, but I also don't want our friend group to fall apart. There was an instance today which provoked me to write this post. My friends were spam calling this group chat we have, so I asked them why they were spam calling. My friend who I'll call Mason said it's not us and *insert Robyn's old name* kept leaving and rejoining the call and told me to cry about it. I said I will, but I asked him why he calls Robyn by *insert old name* because I thought she went by Robyn. Mason responded with ""Because *insert old name* is her name."" Robyn didn't say anything in the group chat, but I texted her about it and said that it pissed me off that people couldn't respect her, she agreed but said that she just learned to accept it and is going to distance herself from Mason and our other friends next year. I just feel so bad. I want to stick up for her more but Mason just doesn't listen, he isn't known for changing his mind, and he can be really mean.

31,1ewaqys,AITA for telling my dad that I’m worried about his partner at my grandmother’s funeral?,"My parents divorced when I was young. My dad has a long-term (12 years plus) girlfriend, who he never married or moved in with but would see every weekend. We always got on well initially but several years ago she decided to end all contact with me for reasons unknown to me at the time. As I lived primarily with my mum growing up and only stayed with my dad every other weekend, my dad would spend every other weekend with me and the other weekend with her. This arrangement worked well for years until we crossed paths at a family event where she falsely accused me of secretly taking photos of her and sending them to my mother to laugh at. Even after allowing her to see my camera roll and my messages to my mother to prove my innocence, she continued to accuse me of doing this for 2 years until she reluctantly agreed to seek counselling. She has since apologised in writing but I don’t totally believe it was sincere. I also learnt at this point that she only cut contact with me all those years ago due to jealously over the fact that I had a more privileged upbringing than she was able to provide to her own daughter. My dad has fully taken my side in all of this, even coming close to breaking up with her several times over the matter, but they’re still together. It affected me quite a lot at the time but I just sort of got on with it and carried on with my life after the dust settled.

He now thinks I’m being selfish for creating family drama when he’s also obviously shaken up over his mother’s death.

34,1ewadc8,AITA for asking my sisters boyfriend to apologise?,"I (22m) recently celebrated my birthday. For this I specifically requested that nobody buy me any presents or give me any money, only that they turn up to my birthday party (a dinner at the house) in black tie as my girlfriend (22f) had never been to a black tie dinner before. 

I made formal invitations and sent multiple messages in the family group chat that all made the dress code very clear.

We have hosted black tie dinners in the past and my sisters boyfriend (36m) has often 'dressed up' for the occasion but never put full black tie on- I assumed this is because he does not own it. Knowing this I messaged him privately a month prior to the dinner offering to help him find a suit that would fit & that I would pay for. I found one that was reasonably priced and that I suspected may fit him in a local charity shop. I sent him a photo of this and he said (something along the lines of) 'thank you but it's not my sort of thing'.
I thought this meant he would not be interested in coming (as he did not reply to my following message). I still gave him a formal invite anyway in case he changed his mind.

On the day all of the guests arrived in dress code and we had a drinks party before the dinner and played some garden games - midway though one of the garden games my sister and her boyfriend arrived both dressed in t shirt and shorts. Seeing this I went over to them to ask him privately why they had not put on his black tie as it was the one wish I had for my birthday and my sister boyfriend  replied with 'what are you talking about'. Obviously annoyed I walked away and did not mention it for the rest of the night. Later in the night people were asking eachother to do speeches and he asked me to do a speech saying 'I want to hear what you have to say'. Throughout the night they littered the conversation with snide remarks about how ridiculous the whole thing was and how silly we all looked. This really annoyed me but I still did not give either of them a reaction.

I enjoyed my birthday dinner but couldn't help feel disappointed in my sisters boyfriend and my sister for not showing up with the single request I had- especially since the rest of us dressed up for it.
I told my mother the following morning I would not be speaking to either of them until they apologise for their comments.


2 weeks pass and I still hadn't seen  them (they had been abroad on holiday) and the first time I saw them they said hello and I said to them 'I am not interacting with you until you apologise for the behaviour you exhibited at my birthday party'.
My mother became furious with me over the issue and will not speak to me or even acknowledge my perspective, she is now demanding that I apologise to both my sister and her boyfriend and that we will never dress up for dinner again.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-19,"AITA for asking my sisters boyfriend to apologise? I (22m) recently celebrated my birthday. For this I specifically requested that nobody buy me any presents or give me any money, only that they turn up to my birthday party (a dinner at the house) in black tie as my girlfriend (22f) had never been to a black tie dinner before. 

I made formal invitations and sent multiple messages in the family group chat that all made the dress code very clear.

We have hosted black tie dinners in the past and my sisters boyfriend (36m) has often 'dressed up' for the occasion but never put full black tie on- I assumed this is because he does not own it. Knowing this I messaged him privately a month prior to the dinner offering to help him find a suit that would fit & that I would pay for. I found one that was reasonably priced and that I suspected may fit him in a local charity shop. I sent him a photo of this and he said (something along the lines of) 'thank you but it's not my sort of thing'.
I thought this meant he would not be interested in coming (as he did not reply to my following message). I still gave him a formal invite anyway in case he changed his mind.

On the day all of the guests arrived in dress code and we had a drinks party before the dinner and played some garden games - midway though one of the garden games my sister and her boyfriend arrived both dressed in t shirt and shorts. Seeing this I went over to them to ask him privately why they had not put on his black tie as it was the one wish I had for my birthday and my sister boyfriend  replied with 'what are you talking about'. Obviously annoyed I walked away and did not mention it for the rest of the night. Later in the night people were asking eachother to do speeches and he asked me to do a speech saying 'I want to hear what you have to say'. Throughout the night they littered the conversation with snide remarks about how ridiculous the whole thing was and how silly we all looked. This really annoyed me but I still did not give either of them a reaction.

35,1ewabwe,AITA for calling my gf selfish for backing out of moving in with me? ,"My gf(25F) and I(28M) have been dating for about 2.5 years. We met right after college and have been very serious except we don’t live together. I wanted to move in together after year but she didn’t want to because her landlady/roommate gives her a good deal on rent. Her roommate’s family is rich and bought her an apartment because she has a lot of serious food allergies. She had roommates before but some would forget and bring home the allergens so she lived alone for a while. My gf always remembers not to and she is also a nurse which makes the roommates parents like her as she knows how to use an epi pen and respond to emergencies. She pays $700 all inclusive on rent for a 2 bed 2 bath whereas a studio in their area is like $1800 not including utilities. So I feel like the relationship is not going anywhere because she doesn’t want to leave the cheap rent but she could afford to pay more for rent but won’t as long as her roommate doesn’t kick her out. 

A few months ago her roommate was laid off and was talking about moving cities if she couldn’t find another job in this one. My gf and I began talking about moving in together as she would also need to leave in this case. We found the right place after looking for a while but she refused to sign as her roommate found another job. I was pissed because we had spent a lot of time looking at apartments and now she won’t sign. The place would have been $2100 plus utilities which means she would need to pay $1200-1300 a month which isn’t that bad given her salary. It’s more than what she is paying with her roommate but I don’t know I just feel like if she cared about our relationship she would pay it as we agreed we can’t process without living together. 

She also recently paid off all her student loans from saving money from paying low rent and is now indulging herself. I have bought up moving in or maybe getting engaged and buying property together but she says she has worked hard her whole life and now that her student loans are gone she deserves some nice stuff. She has bought a lot of clothes and recently bought AirPods. She was showing them to me and I just said under my breath that she was choosing fancy headphones over us. She got mad and told me I was being ridiculous and that if I could pay what she does for her rent I would never want to leave either. I told her if would because I care about the relationship and I’m not selfish enough to choose clothes or AirPods over moving in. She left my apartment and hasn’t talked to me all weekend.

36,1ew9wmq,AITA for Refusing to let my Daughter have a Play date at my Friends Daughters House?,"Okay so I(43F) have never used Reddit before but I love listening to these stories on YouTube and podcasts so excuse me if I miss some steps.

My 8 year old daughter has been doing gymnastics for 3 years and this is her first year on a competitive team. We moved this past year and switched gyms. Her team is her and 12 other girls. I and a lot of the parents like to watch the practices whenever I can and I’ve gotten pretty close to the other parents from traveling to comps as well.

I got close with one mother in particular, I’ll call her Anna. Anna and I’s daughters are the only 2 black girls on the team and I think that’s why we bonded initially especially since she told me last year she was the only mom of color on her daughters team.

Anna often vents to me about the drama going on in her life and it sounds like a lot. She has a lot of kids and a lot of stuff going on but the most striking thing is that her sons father keeps showing up to her house trying to see his son and they’ve had to get the police involved. 

I grew up in a big family similar to hers so I relate a lot. I had many scary experiences growing up in a dangerous area and I worked my a** off to ensure my kids would never have to go through things like that and I think I can be a little too protective.

Our daughters have gotten pretty close and have started having playdates and I want them to be at my house. I am very busy with my 2 other kids who are involved in sports as well so it’s hard to plan. Anna has suggested hosting play dates at her house and I kinda talk around the subject and I think it hurts her feelings and is a little btchy of me.

 It’s definitely not personal, she’s watched my daughter while traveling at comps and I definitely trust her but with how crazy her life and house is I’m just not sure about her going there alone. I wouldn’t mind going there with her to chat with Anna while the girls do their thing but as I said im very busy and when I’m not I think it’s still easier to do things at my place. So Reddit, AITA?

37,1ew9l39,AITA for not changing my weddings seating plan for my mother?,"Hey guys, very excited to be getting married to my fiance (27f) this Saturday.

There has been a lot of drama regarding our guest list. It began with the fact that I (26m) have a much smaller family than my fiance. Our venue is capped at 150 people, and the split between her family vs mine is probably about 70/30. She prioritizes her family very heavily - for me, honestly I’m not super close with them but I still care for them deeply. This split in guest list was a compromise that at first I didn’t feel 100% about but after a few days, I just realized it was the reality and it eas important for my fiance.

Because of this, we both have very few friends coming. Outside the wedding party, we both have less than 10 people between both of us who aren’t related to us in some way coming to the wedding.

After the initial guest list was made and invitations were sent, I got a very intense phone call from my mom about this. She is not very close with her family and thought it was unfair to her that we didn’t get to invite as many guests. She says because she is closer to her friends, she would like to invite her friends as she considers them more “family”. 

She was extremely upset about this and she also spoke to me in a very hurtful way. To try to come to a compromise, I told her I would prioritize her friends as RSVPs for declined. This ended up being 12 people that are solely her friends - I have little to no relationship with any of them. My fiancés mom has only 3 friends coming - once again, trying to prioritize family over friends. I obviously would’ve liked to invite more of my own friends, but once again, I prioritized my own/fiances family as we both believe that’s most important.

Fast forward to our seating chart. We ended up putting her friends in the back of the room - once again, prioritizing family over friends. My/my fiances friends are all sitting in the same back row as them. My mom is furious about this and wants them to be moved up closer. This would involve moving our own cousins into the back row, which makes me fee uncomfortable, as I feel it is disrespectful to my cousins, and also I don’t know my moms friends at all.

I’m kind of at a loss for words at this point. I feel like I gave my mom an inch and now she is trying to take a mile. I understand her not being close with her family, but I’ve already prioritized her friends over my own for my own wedding. I’m not exactly sure if there’s anything more I can do.

If it helps, my finances family is covering the majority of the cost for the wedding, while my parents are covering probably 20% - however, both families are quite well off and could both have paid in full. My family has also helped my pay for my house, which I am extremely grateful for.

So, AITA? Do I conceded and move my moms friends closer to the front? Or stand my ground?

Edit: just to try to clear things up, I didn’t mentioned the financial aspect to insinuate that my parents should have less influence because they paid less - I just thought it was an important detail as in other posts who was paying became something to consider.

38,1ew9kiy,AITA for kicking my friend out over a scratched pool stick?,"I like to play pool so last year I bought a proper 3 piece slate Connelly table and had it professionally installed. I've got a cue stick rack with 3 bar/house generic pool cues mainly to use for breaking and then 2 other playing cues. One is mine that only I use, and the other is a cheaper cue that friends use when they come over. I don't really care about the value of the friend cue but I care about leaving things in the same condition as you found them when at a friend's house.

I had a friend and his gf over last night to play pool, only he played pool with me, not his gf, and towards the end of the night I noticed scratches on the handle of the friend cue, which he was using. When I looked at his hands I noticed he had long, jagged fingernails, so in typical guy fashion I brought the pool stick over to him to show the scratches and just gave him shit. I didn't ask him to pay for it or anything like that, only gave him a little shit to mess around.

At this point I should mention that we've had a couple drinks but I wasn't being aggressive, just trying to banter, but I guess my friend took it personally and started getting angry and in my face saying that I was lying and that he didn't scratch the handle. I'm pretty observant about the condition and state of things in my house and I know for a fact that the handle wasn't scratched before he came over. So things get heated and his gf was trying to stop him arguing, but in the end I had to tell him to leave. I admit I did dig at him a bit and told him to go home, sober up, get some sleep and look at his lady fingernails in the morning and call me after he's calmed down (probably what makes me the asshole in this situation), but he cursed at me and said he wasn't going to call and left with his gf in a fit.

39,1ew9hxe,AITA for yelling at my friend for being too high at my birthday party?,"I (34) have a friend, “Kelsey” (32), who struggles with a severe ketamine addiction. Her partner is also an addict and alcoholic but denies addiction is real. She switched from cocaine to ketamine, downplaying its severity and claiming it’s just her “thing.” Despite a high income and low expenses, she often begs for money for her pets' vet bills due to spending hundreds weekly on ketamine. Her behaviour has worsened over the past two years, and she frequently lies about her drug use, blaming her disconnection on diabetes, even though there’s clear ketamine residue around her nose.

In the past year, Kelsey has had several alarming incidents, including going into a k-hole while holding a butcher knife, screaming at her partner in front of me, and having drugs delivered to my house while claiming sobriety. When I voice concerns, she either dismisses or gets angry with me. She equates ketamine use with smoking or drinking. At her last birthday party, she was so impaired that she flailed on the dance floor and accidentally hit people. Her dad asked me about her drug use, but I lied because she had requested I not disclose it.

For my birthday party, I invited Kelsey despite my reservations, making it clear that it was a family-friendly event where drug use was unacceptable. However, she got excessively drunk and high, leading to inappropriate actions like insulting a 7-year-old and making disturbing comments about dog training. Some guests chose not to stay for the later BBQ due to her behaviour, and others suspected her of drug dealing or an overdose.

Towards the end of the evening, I suggested playing Telestrations, but Kelsey and her partner were disruptive. She insulted me, saying my ""autism was fucking autisming"" and I was ruining the fun. Frustrated, I yelled at her, saying it wasn’t about my autism but that she and her boyfriend were too high. I pointed out it was the third consecutive year she had been too messed up at my party and mentioned the visible ketamine on her face. They left, and I apologized to my guests for my outburst, explaining it wasn’t isolated. Over the next few days, guests reached out to support me, saying they understood why I acted the way I did.

I later sent Kelsey a letter apologizing for how I yelled but making it clear that her behaviour was unacceptable and hurtful. I told her I needed to step away for now but hoped she could turn her life around. She responded with a letter obsessively praising my husband and making personal attacks against me. She accused me of being terrible and claimed several guests apologized to her for my behaviour, saying everyone was too afraid to be honest with me.

42,1ew963q,AITA for telling my dad in front of his ILs that I'd rather live with my grandparents?,"After my mom died my dad relied on her parents for 3 years to take care of me. I (15m) was 3 when mom died. They would pick me up at 7am from dad's house and take me to their house and dad would pick me up at 8pm after he was finished work/errands. They were more like parents to me than he was. He worked 6 days a week and typically most Sunday's I spent at least 4 or 5 hours with them too. They took me to my first day of school, picked me up early if I was sick, they were there when I was sick. My earliest memories are of my time with them. I don't really remember dad from back then.

This changed when my dad met Beth. One minute it was me going to my grandparents every day and then Beth lived with us and suddenly I was home with her instead. My dad and grandparents fought about it a lot and he ended up telling me when I was 7 that I wasn't going to see then anymore and he and Beth were getting married. A month before the wedding I was sitting in front of a judge and being asked questions about my dad, my grandparents and stuff. The judge was nice. I don't remember a lot of our talk. But afterward I did get to see my grandparents again. My dad wasn't happy. I was 10 when my grandparents admitted they had to take dad to court to see me again.

My dad hates that I see my grandparents as much as I do (three days a month, one overnight a month and for a day around my birthday and Christmas). He hates that I leave my half siblings behind to go and see them. There are times he has talked about going back to court and has asked me if I'd say I don't like going without my siblings, and I always tell him I wouldn't say that.

Beth hates my grandparents too, but for a different reason. She blames them for me rejecting a closer relationship with her because they never allowed me to feel like I didn't have a mom. And I do feel that way kinda. It's hard to describe. I know she's not here. I can't speak to her. But I still don't feel 'motherless'. I don't want to have that kind of relationship with Beth and it upsets her. I don't think it's cool for her to want that so badly, because I'm sure she'd hate to be forgotten by my half siblings. So I don't like her much for that.

My dad bitches more about my grandparents now than he did when I was younger. My half siblings are old enough to know I go to grandparents and they can't come. He also knows I prefer being with my grandparents and he hates it. Beth's parents and siblings and their spouses were at our house Saturday night for a dinner party and dad was bitching about my grandparents to them and everyone was acting like my grandparents were bad people for taking dad to court and for not letting me forget mom. Dad said during the party that he'll never understand why I want to go there so badly still. I said I'd rather live with my grandparents than him. Everyone went quiet and dad made me go to my room. He was so mad yesterday and he told me I should know better than to try and humiliate him like that.

He will hover over you until whatever you said you were doing that made him have to wait is finished. Dinner, work, going to the bathroom. It doesn't matter. ""You're done? Good, I need X.""

I've made it clear that I'm tired of his BS and that he's on notice. We had it out earlier this summer when he decided to tell me to fuck off. I told him that it's time to leave.

He's on my health insurance, eats the food that we buy, uses utilities like he's paying for them, can't do a dish, doesn't say thank you when he's given dinner that's made for him, won't say a word at the dinner table in favor of looking at his phone the whole time. 

If he's engaged by one of us during dinner, he yells and says that we're not being fair. The latest was when his mom asked how his girlfriend was and when he was going to see her. I don't understand how this wasn't fair, but I said that he was right. We have no right to ask him about his personal life and that we have no idea what he might be going through because we've lived in a vacuum until just that moment.

I said I understood and moved it immediately. I rang their doorbell to ask if it was fine where I moved it (sort of more inside the balcony, much further away from the sides, so no seeds would spill to their garden), or if they prefered that I remove it altogether. Before I could even finish my sentence, the neighbours wife yells at me that she doesn’t want to find a single bird seed in their entire garden. Obviously I now removed it entirely.

50,1ew7xzu,AITA for convincing my sister change her baby's name?,"This is my first time posting on Reddit after a long time lurking. On mobile, so sorry for any typos.
My sister (19f) announced to the family that she and her boyfriend were pregnant a few months ago. She immediately followed it up with the names she'd chosen: Tyler is it was a boy (after the father), or Savery if it was a girl (pronounced ""savory""). Apparently she liked the name Avery, but wanted to make it unique, hence the extra letter. Obviously, this is a terrible name for a baby, and I politely asked if they were considering any other names. She said no, that they'd already decided. My sister and I aren't really close, so I decided to let it be and congratulated her.
A while later, my sister announced that they were definitely having a girl, and that little Savery was healthy so far. At this point, I'd decided to become more involved with my sister, since this was going to be my first niece or nephew. But I couldn't stop thinking about the poor kid getting teased for her name.
My sister has untreated BPD and any direct challenge to her decisions always escalates to a huge blowout, so I had to play my cards carefully. I got her a specific baby name book from my mom, the very same book our mom had gotten both of our names from. She loved this gift and we spent all night eating snacks and going through it. That night, I opened up about my concerns for the name she'd chosen and the bullying that might come from it, which she was receptive to, because we'd both been bullied in school.
Over the next few weeks, I said things like, ""Oh, this would be a cute name"" or ""I saw the coolest list of names on Pinterest."" My sister loved some of the names and finally, after all of that, she announced that she had settled on the name ""Margo"" instead, taken from the baby name book. I was overjoyed at having saved my niece from a life of being named the way someone would describe a steak.
Shortly afterwards I got a text from my sister's boyfriend, who I didn't really know at all because he was never home when I was there, calling me all sorts of terrible things for getting involved in his family. I asked what he was talking about and he continued to cuss me out because he chose the name Savery and I had no right to change it. I pointed out that I was only interested in the well-being of my niece and that my sister was my family, so I had a right to an opinion. This man had the nerve to tell me that I was an idiot, that I didn't know anything about family since I was still single despite being older than both of them. I pointed out that I clearly wasn't the dumbest one in the conversation, since I didn't try to name my daughter after a literal piece of meat.

My sister (19f) announced to the family that she and her boyfriend were pregnant a few months ago. She immediately followed it up with the names she'd chosen: Tyler is it was a boy (after the father), or Savery if it was a girl (pronounced ""savory""). Apparently she liked the name Avery, but wanted to make it unique, hence the extra letter. Obviously, this is a terrible name for a baby, and I politely asked if they were considering any other names. She said no, that they'd already decided. My sister and I aren't really close, so I decided to let it be and congratulated her.
A while later, my sister announced that they were definitely having a girl, and that little Savery was healthy so far. At this point, I'd decided to become more involved with my sister, since this was going to be my first niece or nephew. But I couldn't stop thinking about the poor kid getting teased for her name.
My sister has untreated BPD and any direct challenge to her decisions always escalates to a huge blowout, so I had to play my cards carefully. I got her a specific baby name book from my mom, the very same book our mom had gotten both of our names from. She loved this gift and we spent all night eating snacks and going through it. That night, I opened up about my concerns for the name she'd chosen and the bullying that might come from it, which she was receptive to, because we'd both been bullied in school.
Over the next few weeks, I said things like, ""Oh, this would be a cute name"" or ""I saw the coolest list of names on Pinterest.""

51,1ew7qeu,AITA for not inviting my step-siblings to my wedding,"My fiance and I are getting married. We both decided we want to have a smaller wedding limited only to immediate family and a few close friends. ""Immediate family"" being defined as the family members we interact with on a regular basis, as both of us have family members we haven't spoken to in years. Were doing this because hosting a big event with large crowds really stress us out, so were keeping it small. 

Now here's the thing, I have 5 step-siblings. If you count SOs its about 8 people in that pool. Which is a significant increase to our guest size. Also every one of them came into my life after I became an adult and moved out (AKA I didn't grow up with any of them). So I didn't invite them for the reasons I mentioned above. I don't have anything ageist them and there all good people, its just we only have limited number of venue slots and we are keeping it small, and I hardly interact with them. 

And for the kicker. My dad called yesterday to give me some shit for not inviting his wife's three sons, Bill, Bob, and George. Am I the asshole for standing my ground and not inviting them? He was saying ""Well its common courtesy and expected for you to invite them"" and ""George in particular was really looking forward to it"". 

For context, I've interacted with Bill and Bob maybe 7 times total in my life. I've only seen George once in the past 5 years, and hes also never texted/called/responded to anything I've sent him. So I doubt he cares as much as my dad made it seem. 

Also If I make an exception for them, people talk so I'll hear a bunch or ""Well, you invited those step-siblings.

52,1ew7q87,AITA because my husband took our child around some man I’ve never met,"AITA because my husband took my infant daughter around some man I’ve never met? 

My  (36)f husband (41)m took our 10 month old daughter to his mother’s yesterday to visit and was gone for 3 hours. He does this once a week and she loves visiting her gamma. Today his mother came over and during conversation asked me if I had met Let’s call him Nate, and I said who? Apparently when my husband went to her house yesterday he had a man with him called Nate, and my mil was uncomfortable with this man being there and understandable unhappy that her time with her son and grandchild was interrupted by this guy being there. Also… they only visited her for an hour before leaving. My husband was gone with our child for over 3 hours . I’ve never even heard of someone called Nate and we have a limited group of people with interaction with where we live as most of our friends live all over the country. My husband didn’t mention anything to me about this guy. 

For some back ground my husband is a recovering addict. He’s had a few relapses and while he does his best he still leans more towards partying than I like. He loves our daughter very much but he has struggled with the life style change of having a baby. 

Anyway after some digging mil tells me that he apparently met this guy recently down the street from where we live. We live on a cute little block in town but not the best area and not far from a not great area of town. Again he’s never mentioned this guy to me. Mil says my husband and Nate talked about partying the entire time they were there. At this point I’m pretty livid. He took our child and had her around a strange man I didn’t know for several hours just the three of them, and and hour at his mothers hours and on top of it all didn’t say a word about it. Just let me assume he was with his mother the entire time. The biggest issue to me is this is not safe! When I asked him about it he yelled at me saying I didn’t want him to have any friends and that I am always getting on to him for everything. He stormed out and slammed the door scaring our two dogs ( Aussies). Examples of me getting on to him are asking him not to drive our daughter after drinking a few beers, asking him to take his car and not mine when he goes out to have a drink with his friend I know. 

I guess my question here is aitah for not wanting my husband to take our 10 month old daughter somewhere with a man I have never met before. 

Don’t know that this matters but I am not a sahm I’m a nurse so I work 3 days a week and I’m also in a graduate program currently.

53,1ew7p0i,AITA for telling my fiancé that him & his buddies messed up & didn’t confront a situation that should’ve been dealt with a year ago?,"Edit because people seem to be confused. 
ALL names are fake due to protection of their identity. I edited some of it to help. 

So a little background:

I  (31F) have a fiance, Devin (32M) who had an issue with someone last year. My fiance is in a band and this person he had an issue with is also in a band, Jimmy. Jimmy had been in the band for about 4 years when he out of nowhere decided to leave the band. Everyone was shocked, especially Devin. Devin asked him why he was leaving and he said he just wasn’t feeling it anymore and was burnt out. Well, his other bandmate, Edward, came to Devin and told Devin that Jimmy was talking bad about him and their drummer, Joe. Edward told Devin that Jimmy wanted Edward to throw him out of the band and that Joe and Devin are holding the band back. This was not the reason that Jimmy gave Devin. Devin was FURIOUS! He blew up on Edward about Jimmy. 

For a bit of context of Jimmy: Jimmy was not great at bass guitar playing until Devin put his heart and soul into teaching him. He helped him every chance he could. This man goofed off so much during their practices that it’d piss everyone off, yet Devin didn’t give up on him. Since he’s left, their band has been thriving so far, farther than they did with him in the band. 

Now to the issue: his buddy Edward had a party at their home with his fiance. They invited us, but we couldn’t go, BUT we noticed that he invited Jimmy and his wife. Edward knew that Devin does not feel comfortable around Jimmy after the lies he told him. When Devin tried confronting Jimmy, he denied it. Devin saw it and was extremely pissed off. He couldn’t believe that Edward invited him. Well, we couldn’t go to the party anyway because we had a previous engagement, but he felt a lot of betrayal. I told him that during that time, which it’s been a year ago, he should’ve confronted his ex friend Jimmy and told him he knew about the situation. He also said that he feels like he doesn’t have friends because of it. 

I told him he needs to confront them about it and let them know about his feelings. He says it’s not worth it but I told him they all failed to address this situation and they all didn’t properly communicate about the situation. I told him that he should’ve told his ex best friend he knew what was said. I told him he needs to tell his best friend how he feels and don’t be aggressive. He got upset with me saying I shouldn’t push him to do it but I told him he needs to either confront it or stop dwelling on it because he’s hurting himself with it. I also told him that he needs to tell his friends what they did was unacceptable and his best friend should’ve been more respectful, but he also needs to understand that you can’t force someone to not be friends with someone, even if they did you wrong. I feel like I was wrong for saying the last part, but I don’t believe I was wrong for telling him to be real with them. He’s upset a bit with me because he says it’s not my situation but also understands why I’m so hellbent on getting them to resolve this issue.

54,1ew7ei1,AITA for not telling my family about me being hospitalized?,"I (F 18yo) was hospitalized about a year ago due to an unspecified eating disorder. I have always been someone to keep things to myself, especially when I’m insecure about it. 

My eating disorder didn’t start because I was trying to be skinny but because I was very stressed and had no appetite a majority of the time. So when I started to lose weight rapidly, I became very embarrassed. My family members would always comment on how skinny I was growing up and I knew that if they were to see me at that moment, all skin and bones, that they would be disappointed. After a while my mother noticed my weight loss despite the baggie clothes I used to cover my body and got me some help. The outpatient help wasn’t working and after a while they decided it would be best for me to be admitted.

Everyone who was around me during that time knew about my situation. My parents knew, my brother knew, my close friends knew, and almost anyone who reached out to me during that time knew. I never posted anything on social media about it or went out of my way to tell people because I was embarrassed and knew many people would have their own opinions and that’s not what I needed in that moment. Fast forward a few months, I’m back home but on a strict eating schedule with minimal physical activity to gain weight. My twin cousins (F 25) reached out to check up on me as they do every few months. During casual conversation I mentioned about my eating plan forgetting I haven’t told them about me being hospitalized. After a few questions I explained everything and told them that I am on a better path now and am gaining weight. They gave me supportive words and said they wished I told them sooner but that was all. I told them I wasn’t really telling many people and felt insecure about the situation. They said they understood and the conversation ended. 

Now, almost a year later at a family gathering, one of the twins had said something to my mom in a standoff-ish manner about how it was months after my hospitalization that they were told. They blame my mother for not telling them although I told my mother not to tell anyone. I was 17 at the time almost 18 and my mother respected that I didn’t want my business to be told to everyone especially not by me.

56,1ew7afd,AITA - Photographer addition.,"I’ve been a wedding photographer for 7 years, managing it part-time alongside a full-time job. My clients have generally been fantastic, but my recent experience was quite challenging.

In fall 2023, a mutual friend connected me with a bride and groom who had a $600 budget. Despite my lowest package being $1750, I offered them a significant discount (against my better judgement) understanding the financial pressures.

The bride sent a $300 deposit, and I provided the contract and questionnaire on November 27. By April 19, I’d received only the questionnaire back.

On the wedding day, the bride was immediately confrontational, loudly arguing with her wedding party and the videographers. I managed to get through the day despite the tension, but things took a turn when I went to get the couple’s dogs for photos. They had already left for the next location.

I arrived at the new location at the same time as the couple, but the bride screamed at me for missing photos of her leaving the parking lot—a detail I hadn’t been informed about. I was so shaken that I had to step away. The bridal party later apologized for her behavior.

It started raining, and I used my own umbrella to ensure I could get photos of the couple. I reminded the couple to ensure umbrellas were packed the day before the wedding. They forgot.

I stayed 2.5 extra hours beyond the 6-hour contract to capture all key moments for free, even though the bride had already been unkind to myself, the DJ, the videographers, etc.

The following day, I reached out to offer additional photos missed due to the rain, but received no response. On August 13, seven weeks after the wedding (per my contract), the bride inquired about the photos. I informed her they were ready but would be sent once the contract was signed. She signed the contract on August 16, and I promptly sent 358 photos.

The bride then complained about 75 black-and-white photos (many of which had a color option included) saying they made her sad and reminded her of a funeral. Despite my contract stating that editing is at my discretion, I added 25 more color photos. They were still unhappy and insisted on all photos in color. Her husband called, mentioning family health issues and offering more money, but I declined, saying it wasn’t about money anymore.

The bride continued calling late at night.

I feel I’ve done more than enough to meet their expectations and am unsure if I should continue making changes or consider the matter closed.

Given that it’s peak wedding season and my other clients have been respectful, am I wrong for wanting to end further edits?

(Also I opened my door and girl Roomate was in her underwear fixing something in the hallway and to not embarrass her I just said hello and walked past, I think she thought I wasn’t home or maybe she just didn’t care to not wear pants but that’s never happened before). 

They texted in the apartment group chat that we should be considerate and respectful during “rest hours” and not put on washing in the afternoon if we were in the house all day. I was, I’m on vacation and slept in I didn’t have tutoring class this morning. 

So to me it sounds like I have to not do laundry in the afternoon because they want to come home to quiet because the machine can be loud for parts of the cycle, however laundry is something we all have to do. Whether I do it or they do it in the afternoon why should my schedule matter? 

I personally do not understand what is wrong with me doing my laundry when I want as long as it’s not in quiet hours. I can’t tell if this is them being petty or if it is in fact inconsiderate of me to do laundry during their “rest hours”. I don’t really know why I should have to cater around their schedules to do laundry, if I prefer to do it in the evening I don’t see how that should be a problem. 

We have quiet hours from 22:00-08:00. I have never done washing during that time. These “rest hours” are the first I’ve been hearing of them, I don’t personally consider free time rest hours. I also don’t care about noise too much I guess because boy Roomate will play his music not loudly but until late which I don’t complain about. 

AITA for doing my laundry during their rest hours?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-19,"AITA for doing laundry during “rest hours” So I live in a share flat with two other roommates. We’re all mid 20’s; me girl, boy Roomate and girl Roomate.  I’ve lived here a year and the two of them longer than that. 

We often have problems with one person leaving trash and dirty plates for days until they are reminded, that’s the boy Roomate. 

The girl Roomate and I are the ones who cook most often and we both typically clean up after ourselves barring forgetting here and there.

58,1ew76if,AITA for forcing my wife to remove her tattoo she got without consulting me?,"So I don’t really like tattoos on a girl (personal preference) and my wife knows this. On the other hand my wife really wanted to get one.   
  
Then one day out of the blue she gets a tattoo of my name on her collarbone to surprise me. When he showed me that, I really didn’t know how to react. On one side, I was disappointed that she got one but because it was my name, I let it slide because I didn’t want to hurt her feelings. I told her that despite me not liking tattoos I appreciate her gesture.   
  
But since I let that one slide, she kept jokingly telling me that she wants some design on her neck. I told her that tattoos really irk me and I’m not in agreement of this, and just as I also respect her opinions on something’s (for example like she hates me clean shaved so I haven’t really done a clean shave in ages), she should also respect me opinion.   
  
Now here is where the problem is. She had gone home to visit her parents, and she calls me yesterday that I have a surprise and she sends me a photo of a tattoo on her neck. When I saw that, I felt really hurt and disappointed that she couldn’t respect this wish of mine. When I confronted her, she said she is sorry she didn’t know I will be so hurt and to let it go.     
  
When I didn’t accept her apology she started telling me to stop being a kid and not make such a huge scene out of a small thing. She was making me feel like a bad guy to not immediately forgive her.   
  
But I stood my ground and really ignored her apology and I even cancelled our upcoming vacation trip because I had zero mood of travelling anymore. She is now telling me that she will get it removed if it’s such a big problem for me but she is making me feel like an asshole for this. Somehow I am the bad person here. 
  
But am I not justified for having strong preferences and opinions about what my partner should do? Why am I the bad person here when in fact she was the one who went behind my back and did the thing I don’t like.

My dad and sister are both upset with me because I told them I can’t afford to pay $500 for my sister’s birthday trip. 

I told my sister that I didn’t want to get in the way of her having the vacation she wants for her birthday so me and my husband wouldn’t go (it would actually cost  $1000 for both of us). Alternatively if we could find a way to do a cheaper vacation that would also work. The problem is my sister’s boyfriend wasn’t happy that the vacation wouldn’t be ‘all inclusive’ so my dad made the assumption that me and my husband wouldn’t go so that they could have the full all inclusive holiday experience. I was upset by jumping straight to this assumption rather than trying to find a vacation we could all afford. My dad also offered to pay 25% of my holiday costs however that would still cost me $500 which I said I couldn’t afford so he withdrew this offer. 

Rather than them going without me and my husband because we can’t afford it now no-one is going and I am being blamed for this. They are angry with me. My sister said I was being ‘selective with my finances’ and not prioritising her even though me and my husband barely have any money for ourselves let alone other people.

64,1ew59ht,AITA for not selling my house? ,"Me M(33) and my ex F(33) have been in a relationship for 7 years. We had known one another in high school and dated several times since. She eventually moved in with me and had no job or money so I covered all the bills while she looked for work. I was looking for a house when she came back into my life, she did not want the responsibility of a house, and she wasn't sure she wanted to live where we were residing. 

Eventually she decided to house shop with me, she had say in what she liked or disliked and luckily right before covid, we found one we both liked, now mind you, she didn't want ANYTHING to do with the house, just wanted her likes and dislikes to be deciding factors, she didn't want to be on the loan, she didn't want to pitch in for the down-payment, none of the Financials or paperwork was done with her because she didn't want to be part of it. Later she would cry about how she's not on the loan so the house isn't technically hers so I could just kick her out and she would have nothing; I would reassure her that we're together so it's ours and that I would never do that.

Anyhow, for nearly our entire relationship she's wanted me to quit my job, finally for medical reasons i had to leave my job, at the time she was glad for me to leave as she had finally found a job and had been working there for two years. I was very hesitant as I've never had to rely on others financially since i left my parents house but she assured me we would get through it as a team and that i had enough in savings to where i wouldn't need a job for almost a year. 

Now i have been searching for work for about 6 months but haven't had any luck, two months ago we had an argument and she told me she's tired of our relationship and doesn't want to be with me anymore. I told her I needed space to process so I took a few days and we had a discussion in which she said she didn't want to leave me with the house as she knows I'm unemployed and am making the mortgage payment by consuming my life savings. I told her i appreciate that and I'll still not kick her out and I'll respect her as a roommate and friend.

Today she told me we need to get a game plan for the mortgage because me getting a job isn't working, I didn't understand and said I'm working on it and I'll figure it out, she suggested we sell the house and split the funds, I told her i have no intention of doing so and she got super upset; saying I'm being an awful person because of the position I'm putting her in (she cut off her family like 8 months ago). She also suggested I just pay her however much money she's paid in rent over the course of our 7 year relationship, she's only paid rent 2 years and we lived in the house for 3. 

She's only just started to deposit money into our joint bank account when she got her job and even then it wasn't even half the mortgage, nor was it used for the house bills, the money always went to eating out/groceries and her pets/vet bills. AITA?




EDIT: To those asking, a friend is scheduled to move in the next few months (ex gave her blessing) and now she wants me to cancel his move in, I refuse to do so as he'll be paying the same amount as her (cheap for the area). My brother is an attorney and I've got a lease contract being written up as we speak for my friend moving in.

I'm trying to not be so nice",Not the A-hole,2024-08-19,"AITA for not selling my house?  Me M(33) and my ex F(33) have been in a relationship for 7 years. We had known one another in high school and dated several times since. She eventually moved in with me and had no job or money so I covered all the bills while she looked for work. I was looking for a house when she came back into my life, she did not want the responsibility of a house, and she wasn't sure she wanted to live where we were residing. 

Eventually she decided to house shop with me, she had say in what she liked or disliked and luckily right before covid, we found one we both liked, now mind you, she didn't want ANYTHING to do with the house, just wanted her likes and dislikes to be deciding factors, she didn't want to be on the loan, she didn't want to pitch in for the down-payment, none of the Financials or paperwork was done with her because she didn't want to be part of it. Later she would cry about how she's not on the loan so the house isn't technically hers so I could just kick her out and she would have nothing; I would reassure her that we're together so it's ours and that I would never do that.

Anyhow, for nearly our entire relationship she's wanted me to quit my job, finally for medical reasons i had to leave my job, at the time she was glad for me to leave as she had finally found a job and had been working there for two years. I was very hesitant as I've never had to rely on others financially since i left my parents house but she assured me we would get through it as a team and that i had enough in savings to where i wouldn't need a job for almost a year. 

Now i have been searching for work for about 6 months but haven't had any luck, two months ago we had an argument and she told me she's tired of our relationship and doesn't want to be with me anymore. I told her I needed space to process so I took a few days and we had a discussion in which she said she didn't want to leave me with the house as she knows I'm unemployed and am making the mortgage payment by consuming my life savings. I told her i appreciate that and I'll still not kick her out and I'll respect her as a roommate and friend.

Today she told me we need to get a game plan for the mortgage because me getting a job isn't working, I didn't understand and said I'm working on it and I'll figure it out, she suggested we sell the house and split the funds, I told her i have no intention of doing so and she got super upset; saying I'm being an awful person because of the position I'm putting her in (she cut off her family like 8 months ago). She also suggested I just pay her however much money she's paid in rent over the course of our 7 year relationship, she's only paid rent 2 years and we lived in the house for 3. 

She's only just started to deposit money into our joint bank account when she got her job and even then it wasn't even half the mortgage, nor was it used for the house bills, the money always went to eating out/groceries and her pets/vet bills. AITA?




EDIT: To those asking, a friend is scheduled to move in the next few months (ex gave her blessing) and now she wants me to cancel his move in, I refuse to do so as he'll be paying the same amount as her (cheap for the area). My brother is an attorney and I've got a lease contract being written up as we speak for my friend moving in. I'm making a lease agreement for ex too, if she refuses to sign then she's gotta find a new place.

65,1ew598i,AITA for making a suggestive joke during Jackbox?,"I (17M) was at a friends birthday party recently. It was small, a group of us who have been friends through HS, and are about to go to college. We went to a very conservative Christian school that frowned at anything even romantic amongst students. My best friend, “L” (17F) will make somewhat raunchy jokes every now and then that typically the others will laugh at due to the unexpectedness and difference to what they usually hear. I typically only make these jokes when L and I hanging out, because she’s the only one who I know will laugh. 

Anyway, we were playing Quiplash, (as you do), and the prompt was “A weird thing to say in a tickle fight.” I answered “Harder Daddy.” Not the funniest joke in the world, but I thought the absurdity of it would win me the duel. The host didn’t turn on family friendly mode (which everyone clamored for after this, even though everyone besides L and I are literal adults) so one of the first prompts revealed in the round was “The name of a sex position for ghosts” and both people just answered “No” on their cards. (one was 18 and one 19). A few prompts later, the prompt was “A fun activity that only requires three fingers” to which one of the answers was “no” again, and the other was from L, who answered “I mean you don’t need just 3…” Everyone made a weird face at that, except the host, who voted for it, and was somewhat chastised for voting for it. 

The next prompt was my tickle fight one, to which the other answer was “Too much hair gel” (which I think was a safety quip given the nonsensical nature). Everyone yelled out “L’s name” in a “not again but lighthearted” way. After the votes went it, it was revealed I wrote it. L busts out laughing because she didn’t suspect it was me at all, and was the only one who voted for it. Everyone else looks at me with varying levels of disgust. And most of them tell me to not say things like that, and then they rag on L for voting for it. I really don’t think what I said was that bad, but then again I’m autistic and a lot of social norms tend to go over my head. Another friend there, “F” (19M) told me that when every joke is suggestive, it’s not funny. I do agree with that if it goes too far, but this was the only suggestive joke I made?? The other quip I submitted was so bland I don’t even remember what it was. With everyone talking at once and all telling me that what I said was gross, I almost started crying.

67,1ew47qq,AITA for urging my friend to move out before they feel ready?,"I have a friend from college (we’ll call ‘A’) who has been dealing with family issues for a long time, and recently, ‘A’ pretty much ended up kicked out by their family and with no place to go. I already knew about their situation, and when they said they had nowhere to go, I offered to let them stay with me. Knowing how eager they have been to get their own place, I figured their stay would be a month or two. It has now been 6 months.

I have a 2 bedroom apartment where I live with me, my partner, and our dog. One room is our bedroom, the other room is my office where I work from home fulltime. ‘A’ is set up in our living room. 
Since they arrived, they were plagued with nightmares and barely slept, had regular panic attacks, and expressed lots of dark thoughts to me. I also had to regularly coax them to eat and drink. I would sit with them through their attacks and talk them down. It was very draining and led to a lot of late nights for me. For the first few weeks, I felt like a fulltime caretaker. While I’m happy to be there for them, I told them they needed professional help. After some research, I found a therapist for them in the area. They’ve been speaking with them regularly now, and were diagnosed with PTSD.

Even with a therapist, 'A' trauma dumps to me and has meltdowns daily, and it is extremely overwhelming for me since I WFH, and I'm with them 24/7.
They’ve showed no interest in getting a job or an apartment, and whenever I bring it up, it usually leads to them spiraling into a panic attack. ‘A’ has a paid off car, a savings account, and no debt. Their savings isn’t an amount where they can throw away money, but they could live comfortably without a job for several months. A month or two in, ‘A’s’ car was towed because it was in their parent’s name, which sent ‘A’ into another downward spiral. After weeks, we convinced ‘A’s’ parents to sign the car to 'A's' name, and they mailed us the papers. However, ‘A’ still hasn’t signed them. They said they feel there is something ‘holding them back,’ and they want to work on healing themselves first, since their therapist told them they shouldn’t rush the process. They wake up, watch shows on their laptop or scroll social media, and go to sleep. They’re also really frustrating as a roommate. They take up a ton of space, they constantly eavesdrop on me and my partner, they hate my dog, and they sleep till 2-3 in the afternoon and get mad if we’re too loud in the mornings.

I'd call the school I'm currently going to Old School and the one I want to go to New school.

I went to new school before and I liked it so I wouldn't mind. But that would also mean I don't have bus transportation to the school I'm not even supposed to be at. So every morning my mom either expects me to get up at like 5:30 (not a morning person at all) and walk to old school bus stop which isn't that close. I'd say bout a 5-10 minute walk. Or wake her up or my sister at abt 6:10 to drop me off at old school bus stop. 

Old school bus stop comes at 6:20. I know we won't make it cuz they aren't exactly reliable people. They too aren't exactly morning ppl and won't get up immediately. I hate having to rely on them and already i haven't even been to first period at all. Today is also school but im at home. 

I want my mom to switch my school so that it's easier on me but she and my sister are finding a way to make it abt her. Because she has to take off work to unenroll me from new school and enroll me into the new school. And the thing is they're acting like that is a lot. It's a lot for ME to do this crap every day.

71,1ew3vo3,AITA for banning my roommate from using my fridge?,"Now, for a context: I (24F) live in a student campus. My dorm is a corridor-type one and it only has one kitchen per floor. On each kitchen there are two fridges for common use, but there aren\`t many people who keep their food in there, for these fridges are tiny, and there are approximately 70 tenants on each floor. Another reason (and a kind of a brutal unspoken rule) is that whatever food you put in there is as good as gone, because anyone can easily steal it. So, most of the tenants, me included, have their own fridges in their rooms.

I\`ve bought my fridge 5 years ago, when I first moved to the campus and had always let my roommates, whom I had four, use it as long as they could keep it in order. I never used to have any problems until I\`ve met my current roommate (25F). She isn\`t much into cleaning, even after herself, which really pisses me off, but I can put up with it as long as it doesn\`t concern my stuff. However, a couple of times I had to ask her to mind what she stocks in the fridge, because some of her food started to rot and stink.

This summer, after the semester was over, I went to my parents for 3 weeks time and told her that if she were going to leave, too, she needed to get rid of all her perishables in the fridge (I always do this with mine, when going to be away for a long time), and she promised to do so. However, when I went back to dorm a week agp, I found my fridge full of rotten veggies and rotten raw meat, and though I threw this abomination away, it\`s still hard to get rid of the reek. The problem was, that the roommate didn\`t go away for holidays, she was there, in this room, all the time and chose to turn my fridge into a mess. This wasn\`t the first time she\`d done it, but the most serious one, so I banned her from using my fridge, saying that from now on if I found any of her foods in it, I\`d threw it away or put into public fridge and won\`t be concerned about what would happen to it next.

I guess, she complained about it to our mutual friends, for now I\`m getting angry messages, saying that I am an AH and being cruel to her and now she may be left without any food because she\`s afraid of it being stolen from the public fridge. So, AITA?

UPD. Guys, I want to thank you all just so much for your support and your advices (I'll start to try them today to get rid if the smell). As many of you wrote, it appeared that what my roommate told our friends wasn't the truth, but when I started receiving these messages I felt so miserable and was so disturbed (and stupid, too) to check it all up.

Now, one of the friends dm'ed me a screenshot of the chat, where my roommate complained about me not letting her use my fridge just because of ""some smelly fish dish"" she had put there (btw, there was no fish in the fridge unless it's  already turned into liquid...). So, I've sent them photoes of what really was there in the fridge at the time I went back to campus and, as you can guess, most of the friends really changed their minds.

Now, you also asked whether she could have ADHD or depression. Afaik, she isn't, at least she doesn't behave like that, and all the things apart from cleaning, like cooking, washing her clothes (we don't have a washing machine there) and so on, she does often and relatively well. She hasn't been diagnosed and, anyway, we can only guess.

75,1ew3bre,AITA for using the Teams reaction emojis ,"I (F31) started seeing a new guy, Tim (M38) about nine months ago. We're both European if it matters. I've been keeping it extremely casual at first because there are kids involved. 

He's a mature man who has a lot of responsibilities, is smart and open to new things and legitimately a very kind person who helps others in need. We met through mutual friends. 

We've been sleeping over at each other's places more regularly now and are officially dating, which is why I'm comfortable working from his home occasionally as well (we both wfh so it took a bit getting used to). 

I did so today. For my work I stay in constant communication with my team through Microsoft Teams. It's a requirement. We write and are in meetings with each other pretty much the entire day and rely heavily on teamwork. In Teams you can send little reaction emojis to other people's messages and my teams does so very often. 

We send each other thumbs up when we get an answer we needed or a good suggestion and if someone solves an issue or comes in with a great idea, they get hearts. 

Tim saw and has a huge issue with it bc he feels it sends the wrong impression and is altogether too flirty. I showed him everyone in my team uses it, from the team lead, to our senior most employee (who's in his late 50s).

I haven't dated men in a while and I find this extremely immature and stupid. Tim says I'm invalidating his feelings by saying so and is put off by it. My best friend is telling me her boyfriend doesn't like it either and my mom thinks it's extremely silly and to just stop.

77,1ew3417,AITA for not giving the role of father of the bride to both my dad and stepdad?,"My parents divorced when my siblings (32m, 30f, 29m) and I (27f) were young. I was a newborn when they separated for context. My dad never remarried but he had two long term relationships since then. One when we were younger kids. His current partner he met when we were in our teens. Mom and my stepdad married when I was 5.

Our parents shared equal custody of my siblings and me. We were closer to our dad than our mom or our stepdad. Not because dad was a Disney parent or because he didn't have rules. But dad was more of a nurturer and we had a closer relationship with him. We still loved mom but it wasn't the same. I believe at times my stepdad had trouble coming to terms with us being so close to dad and not as close to mom or him. There were times we felt some jealousy and maybe even resentment about it. As an adult I can sort of understand, especially if he loved us like we were his, though I also think it should always be a positive when kids have good biological parents and a stepparent isn't needed to fill that role for a missing parent. It's less trauma for the kids.

Anyway, when I was 10 dad was involved in a bad accident. For a year we couldn't live with him because he was on life support, then in rehab working on recovery. During that year my stepdad really did try to fill the role of ""only dad"". He and mom already had a child together at this point but he focused more on my siblings and me. He was really good to us and I told him a few years ago I appreciated that he didn't resent us being there all the time. But he resented that, at the end of that year, he hadn't solidified himself as dad to any of us. We all still called him by his first name. None of us saw him as more of a dad afterward. We weren't magically so much closer. Dad was still our #1. When most of my siblings were in college but I was still at home, my stepdad became a little more angry and a lot more resentful of dad because dad was their go to person to call. I also chose to live full time with dad at that point.

So the problem today. I'm the last of my siblings getting married. My sister had dad as only father of the bride for her wedding. Now I asked just dad too. My stepdad was quiet about my sister's wedding. But he has spoken up this time and he told me he couldn't understand why I didn't ask them both. He said he did just as much as my dad, and for an entire year he was the only father any of us had. My mom, who weighed in a couple of times, said I was so young when my stepdad and her got married, that it made no sense to see him as less of a father. They told me that even if I asked now it wouldn't hold the same genuine recognition and appreciation for my stepdad. But my stepdad wanted me to know how thoughtless he considered my choice.

So me and my friends work at the same hospital, it happened because we spend so much time here (and therefore with each other) that we eventually became friends and started hanging out outside of the hospital as well. 

We are quite a big group but there's five of us who are closer to each other, mostly because we are like the ""original"" group, and the others started working there later. I'm gonna name them Sarah, Jessica, Kate and Lilly for the sake of this post. 

Sarah works on weekdays as well as weekends, while the rest of us only work M-F. This is important for the post, since because of this, Sarah can't come to all the plans we make. We always invite her, but she sometimes has to say no because of work, and she has complaint before about feeling left out, but we don't think it's our fault we have a different schedule. 

So last weekend, it was Kate's birthday and she threw a little party/get-together at her place. We are very open and comfortable with each other, so we knew Kate wouldn't have a problem if someone needed to sleep over as long as there were free spots to sleep at. 

Lilly and I went together to the party, we planned to go back home after that because we didn""t want to bother Kate, but when we got there we found out that Jessica was sleeping over, so since Kate was having guests anyway, Lilly asked me if I cared to stay so she could drink, I said no, I didn't mind. 

Kate said multiple times throughout the party that if anyone wanted to sleep at her place, we could. No one else accepted her offer. 

When it was time to leave, Sarah was upset that she was ""left out"" from the sleepover, we all told her that she could stay, but she said that we should've told her ""sooner"" because she didn""t have her stuff with her. We told Sarah that it was a last-minute thing, there was no way we could've told her sooner. Also, she very well knew that Kate's doors are open to all of us, she could've asked or bring her stuff with me just in case. 

So, AWTA?? 

Extra info if it matters: we are all mid-twenties/early 30's, me being the youngest (25) and Sarah being the oldest (34). Also, Sarah wasn't the only one leaving, only us three slept there, the rest of the group left.

79,1ew2nre,AITA for clipping the lock on my neighbor's trashcan?,"I (29f) live in an apartment building with my partner(29m). There are 4 units in total but we don't know our neighbors or interact with them besides in passing. They're young, female college students, not exactly sure of their age. When they first moved in, they locked a trashcan to the front gate, which happens to be directly next to my bedroom window. I told my partner that I was upset by it next to my window and that if they didn't take it out we'd have issues. I didn't talk to the girls at the time because my partner told me I was overreacting. Occasionally, they would forget to unhook the lock on trash day. I'd vocalize my frustrations to my partner but never talked to the girls because it was never left there more than a week and he was still telling me it wasn't a big deal.

This week, I've reached my boiling point. These girls seem to have gone home for the summer and left their trashcan chained to the front of the apartment. My window is directly to the left of the can, I'm in a basement unit. I haven't even opened my bedroom window this entire summer due to the trash smell but this got completely out of hand and was starting to overflow into the window well.

Two weeks go by before my partner leaves the first note. The next week trash is out. Great. Maybe 2 or 3 days after trash day, the power goes out in our building and I can tell they aren't home because their alarm is going off non-stop. 1 week goes by, trash isn't taken out and the alarm is still going off. I message our landlord and tell him about the alarm and trash. I doubt he even reached out to them to let them know the alarm was going off. Another week goes by without taking out the trash before my partner leaves the 2nd note saying we will clip the lock if they don't take out the trash.

Finally, the night before trash day comes, their alarm was off and it looked like the can was empty. It's still chained to the gate but looks empty. I'm happy it's gone and I plan on returning the wire cutters. As I'm walking out the door, I saw something in their can. 1/4 of the can is still full of weeks old dog poop bags, water, and other trash. At this point, I'm running late for work and I'm pissed off. I clip off the chain, dropped it in the can, and pulled it to the curb.

I called my partner and he called me TA for not knocking on their door first before immediately cutting the lock. I feel like we gave them a proper warning to have the trash out at the curb on trash day and it wasn't. It was obvious that whoever emptied the can didn't have the key. He told me it's my responsibility to deal with the consequences and that's fine. I'll buy a new lock tomorrow, if I can have a copy of the key. I plan on talking to the girls and making it clear that I want a key but refuse to be responsible for unlocking their trash. If I have to unlock it, I'll be keeping the lock and putting their can in the gated backyard space where everyone else keeps their cans.

80,1ew2f2v,AITA for telling my girlfriend this ,"

So this coming weekend me (male) and my friends who are also all male are planning to go to this bar as we have in the past. My girlfriend, let’s call her Jenna, is also planning to go with her 1 friend Zoe because the rest of her friend group can’t make it. However Zoe was asked by some of her other friends to go out as well, however these friends don’t really know my girlfriend. So Zoe, my girlfriend and Zoe’s friends are going to the same bar as me and my friends but Zoe and her friends are planning to leave after a few hours to somewhere else. 

This is where the problem starts, my girlfriend sort of expected me to be with her, by her side the whole time after Zoe leaves. Keep in mind this would probably be a couple hours. Now, I love spending time with my girlfriend and I don’t mind doing this but I told her, I would prefer if you did go with Zoe and her friends to this other bar. This bar that me and my friends are going to, has a lot of people that we are distant friends with as well so you really talk to everyone in there which is what I like to do. Unfortunately my girlfriend isn’t like that, and she sort of keeps to the same crowd. She’s good friends with practically my whole friend group but it’s just the fact that they’re all boys, so she really wants me to be with her the whole time after Zoe leaves. I don’t want that responsibility of always keeping her by my side and sort of staying in the same place, I want to go talk to all my friends in there and let loose and enjoy my self. Am I the asshole for that? Just to make it clear, I’m not planning to go talk to any females in there or anything, there will be a lot of my male friends there that I just want to have a laugh and drink with. My girlfriend thinks I am selfish and being a bad partner for thinking this way though, I understand where she is coming from but I did say to her, if she plans to stay there after Zoe and her friends leave, then I will be by her side and I would still enjoy it even though it’s not my first option. 

So now my girlfriend is pretty angry with me, I have no issues with what she’s saying, I completely understand her perspective. I’m just not sure how to progress from this. ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-19,"AITA for telling my girlfriend this

82,1ew1oug,AITA for having a venting note on my phone that my girlfriend doesn't know about?,"Throwaway because my gf reads this sub and knows my main.

Tldr: I keep a diary of sorts on my phone which includes alot of me going through my feelings that I can't share with my gf. She saw the file and is angry at me for hiding this stuff. Am I the asshole for not telling her?

I'm a 20 year old male. I've been dating my girlfriend (20F) for just shy of three years now. 

I've always had problems with my emotions and mental health (I guess?). I don't have anything diagnosed but I've always had a crippling fear of failure that has caused me some trouble over the years.

I for the life of me can't talk about emotions. I don't know why but I shut down when my girlfriend tries to get me to open up. I've always dealt with what's going on in my head with jokes and comedy. This was a major problem in my last relationship aswell and was a big reason for us breaking up. I'm actively working on this. Progress is very slow since It's very difficult for me to open up even to my psychologist.

During my worst moments I've been writing my thoughts and feelings to the notes app on my phone to help me deal with them. Like a diary of sorts. I've been writing on it for a couple years now. It has stuff like ranting about my feelings torward my alcohol use, my past relationships, internal conflicts about stuff, things that have gone wrong/suck at work etc etc. Basically anything and everything that's cluttering my head and I need to get out.

Well my girlfriend had gotten her hands on this file. Yesterday she confronted me about stuff on there and demanded that I explain what I mean by some points. Some topics I've written about include but are not limited to:

Me wondering if I'm an alcoholic and how to stop it

How to deal with feelings of immense anger

Ranting about video games and the amount of them that I consume

Conflicting feelings about my ex girlfriend

Conflicting feelings about my current girlfriend I had when we started dating

Wondering if I'm autistic (sorry if this is insensitive)

Wondering if I'm depressed

During the confrontation I froze completely. She had seen something that I'd never want her to see and I had no idea how to deal with it. She kept asking why I never told her about these things and all I could say is I don't know. She went to a friends house for the night and hasn't come back yet.

I feel like I'm allowed to write about these things since they're my thoughts and I'm not sharing them with anyone. I do it for me and me only. My girlfriend feels betrayed I guess because I haven't shared this stuff with her and is propably pretty distressed about some of the topics I have on there, especially some of the heavier stuff I haven't mentioned here.

83,1ew1jfv,AITA for planning to tell my friend not to vent to me about her relationship again?,"I (f 31) have a friend (f 32, let's call her Lisa) whom I knew since Kindergarten. We were best friends when graduating High School and kept in touch until we slowly drifted apart in our mid-20s. A few weeks ago, Lisa reached out to me again which made me happy.

But very soon, all our conversations turned towards her current boyfriend (m 34, let's call him Peter) and how unhappy he makes her. I tried to be supportive but I never met Peter before and everything Lisa tells me is red flags. 

Some examples: Him shouting at her for no reason, telling her her birthday gift for him isn't good enough, accusing her of cheating, ignoring her when she wants to talk, going through her phone without permission etc. I am extremely sorry for Lisa since that really sounds like abuse to me and I want to support her, I myself had been in a similar situation as a teen without support. Unfortunately she's still wearing her rose-coloured glasses and always talks about wanting to make him happy, her future plans of what she wants to do better and her efforts to fix the relationship. So I told her right then and there Peter was toxic to her. I said there is nothing to fix and unless he changes himself on his own, there is nothing Lisa can do besides breaking up. I told her his behaviour is manipulative and some parts of his distrustful behaviour could probably be hints of him cheating. Lisa said several times she wants to give Peter a chance and when he blows it off, it will be over. In the two weeks we are talking to each other again this happend three times already, I always had her back and offered her a shoulder to cry on. And ALL THOSE THREE TIMES she texted me the next day: ""We're all good again and he promises to be better. I give him another chance.""

To me, this is frustrating. As I said, I know how that feels like and I want to support Lisa. But I just can't bear it any longer. It is like telling a toddler not to touch the hot cooking plate and she still does it, burns herself and touches it again, expecting it to be different the next time. Today, she started talking to me again – and again, the topic turned quickly towards a mean thing Peter has done. I was proud when Lisa said she blocked him so she doesn't have to deal with his BS, but in the same sentence she stressed her hopes about him being nice to her again in a few days. I almost snapped and told her that if he doesn't, he'll again show her his true colours which Lisa completely ignored and I gave up. Now I'm thinking of telling her next time she texts me to not vent to me about Peter anymore since she obviously doesn't listen to me and I can't help her that way. 

I don't want to hurt her, but I'm simply not capable of going through that discussion again anymore when I know Lisa will never dump Peter, no matter how mean he is.

I asked my friend if she wanted to bring her SO but she said no SO's until we all have SO's.  Within the last 3 years she went on 3 trips when she was in her influencer era and I did not go- and those were people I barely knew and honestly I could have cared less if I went or not I just wanted her to have fun.

My friend group always pick somewhere domestic and have a 3-4 day weekend and just explore. It consists of mostly food, nature stuff, and sometimes we go to the bars but honestly that's our least favorite part. The trip really isn't about the location but more or less to see each other again and use it as a time to catch up on the nitty gritty we don't talk about. It's a time to just be vulnerable. 

I don't think I am doing anything wrong because literally everyone I know takes trips without their SO's all the time. Then again as a 31M, I tend to be oblivious.

His friends were also treating me more like his mom and expecting me to pick him up from their houses when they needed to get on with stuff.

He fought for 50% custody of our kids which he wasn't given and for the first two or three years he had every other weekend and a two week period during the summer with them as well as alternating holidays. He started being more involved and eventually he did get 50% custody. It was at that time I found out he got some woman pregnant and he realized with three kids he needed to get his act together. He ended up with full custody of his third child. Then he met his wife. They have two more children together now. There are two kids in her life, but I don't believe they're her biological children anyway, who she is also partially supporting. Those two kids don't live with them but apparently she/they pay for stuff for this child.

Ex and I started getting along better but then his marriage was rocky. As his marriage worsened he started treating me like a co-parent to all his kids. He'd bring his other children to custody exchanges and expecting interactions between me and his other children. Then it was requests to babysit for him and his wife, which I never did. Then it was comments about our boys old clothes at my house being sent to his house for his other kids and how *we* needed to make sure they had adequate clothing. I told him there was no we in that and he said of course there is, we're co-parents. I said of our two sure, but not his other kids. It was requests for me to have his children in my home or to take them out to eat with me and our kids. And finally it has turned into back to school craziness. I bought supplies for the boys and he told me I hadn't bought nearly enough *for everyone*. I was like hold up, what's that supposed to mean and he pointed out that what I bought wouldn't be possible to share evenly between all five children. I told him we don't have five children, we have two, the two I bought those for. I told him I am responsible for our children not his three others. I told him he has a wife, they share two of those children, the other is in their home, so it's up to them. He told me that I know they don't have a lot of money and I cut him off and told him that still didn't make his children my problem. He said I can't possibly take care of just two of them, not when we're co-parenting and all five kids live together 50% of the time. He said I should be a part of the community to help raise these kids and keeping my distance like I do is *so dang cold.*

87,1ew02zb,AITA for removing spiders and bugs from our home's entryway via vacuum cleaner?,"My husband (30M) and I (28F) inherited a beautiful home a few years ago. It's quite old and the hallway/entryway of the house is beautiful and antique, but also home to many cracks and crevices that make it very easy for bugs to creep into our house.

I am a huge arachnophobe and literally can't enter our laundry room because of this hallway as I am deathly afraid of the spiders lurking there. They are on the ceiling, in nearly every corner, near the doors, totally webbing up the place. I hate it and have asked my husband on multiple occasions to remove the spiders for me however he pleases (he usually puts them in a cup and puts them outside). He refuses.

He says that the spiders contribute to keeping our house fly- and mosquito free and that they ""also need a place to stay"" when it gets cold, etc. which I understand to a degree but the hallway is quite literally covered in spiders (and other small bugs). One or two spiders I could handle, as long as they stay out of my way, but we're not a spider hotel. We argued about this and I felt very silly arguing over who has to remove the spiders because it seems so minute. Just take them outside!

Well, yesterday I took action after many weeks of hyping myself up and decided to remove them all by sucking them up and then emptying the vacuum cleaner. I simply have no other way because I can't bear the thought of touching them, putting a cup over them or anything else. I put on a face mask, a hat, gloves and other silly equipment because I was afraid the spiders might ambush me and then proceeded to suck them all up, webs included.

My husband came home and was LIVID. He instantly saw the empty corners and confronted me. ""How could you kill them all like that?"" etc. he made me feel guilty over sucking up those damn spiders! I told him that if he had consented to taking them outside via cup or anything else, this wouldn'tve happened, but I simply didn't feel comfortable in my own house anymore and had trouble taking down our laundry into the basement because of those bugs. I used to ""run"" into the house and ""run"" outside because I couldn't stand standing in the entryway for more than a few seconds. Now I finally feel comfortable again, although I must admit, in a few weeks, there's probably going to be more bugs (which I will have to suck up again).

My husband has ranted about this issue with his friends and family and is now making me out to be cruel and heartless, claiming I mindlessly ""killed animals"" simply because I dislike how they look (which is true, to a degree). I feel extremely silly for even discussing this because to me, this is totally normal and I don't see myself as a cruel animal mishandler at all. They're just spiders.

88,1evzjke,AITA for wanting my birthday party theme to be the one I want rather than what my visiting cousin supposedly wants?,"My aunt (referred to as Aunt 1) lives in the UK and came home to visit with her husband, my other aunt (her sister, referred to as Aunt 2) and my two cousins (Aunt 2’s kids, 8M and 11M). They decided to throw me a kiddie-style birthday party at a fast food chain which is popular here where I’m from. I decided to roll with it since I thought it’s fun and sweet of them since they don’t usually throw me parties (they don’t go home during this time of the year). Now these kid parties have themes to choose from. Usually a “boy theme” (like cars or racing) and a “girl theme” (think princesses very stereotypical I know). 

I’m (28M) gay and effeminate but my family knows since I came out to them way back and they’ve been accepting and supportive. They’ve met my boyfriend of five years already multiple times. Aunt 1 is more tolerant rather than accepting tho if I’m being very honest. Her husband, however, has been more vocal about his homophobia before. Nothing openly hostile has happened and Aunt 1 and her husband had already met my boyfriend during one occasion.

Well Aunt 1 and her husband personally arranged everything for the party and asked me to invite my boyfriend and my friends but they chose the boy theme for the party without asking me. At first it didn’t bother me and I even joked with Aunt 1 saying something like “awww but I wanted the princess theme” and she just laughed it off so I didn’t push anymore. I told my mom and grandmother that it bothered me a little bit but that I’d just deal for Aunt 2 and my cousins’ sakes since they rarely come home anyway. Well my mom and grandma (Aunt 1’s sister and mom for clarification) wasn’t having any of it apparently and asked Aunt 1 why she didn’t ask me first and if it could still be changed (they did this without telling me). Aunt 1 said they chose the theme for my 8yo cousin’s benefit instead. This has now resulted in Aunt 1 explaining things to me and the issue has now also reached Aunt 2 (who I love dearly and has been more supportive than Aunt 1). Now I feel bad for bringing it up at all. AITA?

EDIT: Yes, I know it sounds silly but they surprised me with the whole thing. I was perfectly content just getting together and eating out or throwing my own party. These kinds of fast food kiddie parties are practically the norm when you’re a kid where I’m from and intentionally having one as an adult is a cheeky, fun gag.

89,1evz79e,AITA for telling my mom to shut up and accept that my wife and I aren't naming our kids the way she and dad named me and my siblings?,"My wife and I (both late 20s) had our first child together in June. Before he was born there was a lot of talk about names from different family members on both sides, but the pressure to tell was on my side specifically. We didn't tell a soul what the name would be until our son was born and we had left the hospital. My parents were disappointed when we announced our sons name.

My family are very traditional in how they named us. We were each named after grandparents and that's how they feel everyone should name their kids. My wife's family don't have a tradition when it comes to naming babies. They just name them and go. No fuss or insisting on certain names. But my wife's side tends to favor more uncommon and unusual names. 

My wife's and my taste tends to lean a lot more to her side than to mine. Which is how we ended up choosing the name Hollis for our son. This was not something my parents liked because they expected our son to be either Jack (my dad) or Parker (my FIL). But I know they were expecting a little Jack to be born. So that added to their reaction. But they quizzed us on our choice to ""break tradition"" and I told them it wasn't a tradition my wife's family used and we decided we weren't going to have one either.

Over the last couple of months both parents have questioned why, have wanted to discuss other names for future babies. My mom has been the worst by far. She asked why we went with something so unlike the names we have in our family. I told her our family wasn't the only family involved, but that we also didn't take the family tastes into account. We went with what we liked. She pointed out our taste were a lot like my ILs and I said yes, but that it wasn't about my ILs and their taste, it was about my wife's and my taste. I told her I was done discussing it and since that point I now change the topic or end the conversation when she brings it up or refuses to let it go.

We had a little naming ceremony on Saturday and my mom decided she was going to dig in her heels about the name and she told me we'd picked a stupid name and she hated it, she wanted us to change it and name him Jack or Parker. She told me we had no business breaking a long held tradition in our family and there's a reason those traditions are there so foolish people can't name their babies the worst names imaginable. She also said my ILs must be so smug thinking they'll have at least two stupidly named grandkids like they had all stupidly named kids. I lost my temper. I told her to shut up and accept that we're not naming our kids like she and dad named me and my siblings and I told her she would need to leave and learn to be more respectful because I would not take those insults against my wife or her family lying down.

As the Titel reads, i play Remnant 2 with 2 friends.
Friend one is m.
Friend two is w.
We said, we will only play the game together.

Now, my Friend m. is realy angry, because i played the Map Losomn (first map for everyone who doesn't knoe) again ( we already Finished the Map) because i wanna Experience the Story and Lore of the Game. 
For better understanding, he doesn't realy care about Story and Lore of Remnant 2. Dialogs are only pushed trough so that we can Progress faster. I find the Lore and Story intresting and wanna experience them.  So, after we Finished Losomn, i got into Adventure Mode and Player it again, to fully Explore the Story and Lore of the game. I sat 3 Hours there and read some Letters and heared every Dialog in it's full length. Only in the Map we already Finished.

Today i Told him that and he is so Pi***ed at me. That i'm now much Further into the game, that i have more from that, more from this, and that i Played alone..... a Map, that we already Finished and that i Played for the Sole purpose of Lore, something he isn't intrested at all.. 

I have more Upgrade Materials than him, thats right, but it's only natural because i needed to play trough the whole Map again for Lore and Story. 

Now he is playing with friend 2 w. the game Further, maps, that we DIDN'T Played and is now, Quest wise, much Further into the game as me. He plays on Maps, that i didn't even know of. 

Now he says, i did the Same....

91,1evymif,AITA for deciding not to go to my friend’s cross-over birthday trip? ,"So my close friend invited me to New York to come out with him and his other 2 friends (I haven’t met) to celebrate his birthday. I’d be flying out of Chicago and I originally told my friend that’s fine and I’ll be there. However I somewhat don’t want to go anymore. 

The main reason I don’t want to go is because when my friend originally told me about New York he wanted to go for all 3 days. Which was fine since I knew we’d all have fun there. Well a few days ago we were all placed inside a group chat to break the ice so that we could all get along on the trip. So we arranged a FaceTime call after exchanging banned  and there were so many suggestions thrown out about how we should spend the 3 days. My friend decided to go with their suggestions, one being let’s go to New York, DC & Philadelphia in all 3 days instead. So his friends persuaded me to pay for a one way to New York and a one way back from Philadelphia since we’d be driving through these states. 

At first I was okay with this because I knew I wanted to make it a fun trip since I haven’t seen my friend in almost 3 months. However now looking back I regret agreeing to the switched plans because now we’re spending more money for foods, snacks, gas, Airbnb/ hotel and not even including entertainment. Also I should add that nothing is planned either but a concert and a dinner with my friend birthday upcoming. 

So the next day after the group FaceTime call I’m voicing my opinion to my friend and he’s getting annoyed because everyone wants do something other than what was planned. When in reality things should’ve been properly planned with just New York and not the other 2 states to begin with. We schedule another group call and this time I told them how my friend told me  the original plans being in NY for 3 days  and how I was more comfortable with that. I also gave both pros and cons to us just staying in New York and going to the other three states. Then suddenly I was cut off by one of his friends not being able to finish my point.  Eventually the call became awkward. The phone call ends and I call my friend back separately to just tell him I won’t be attending anymore but I’d be okay with us planning something for his birthday.

92,1evygjc,WIBTA to partially side with my MIL comments on my partner and their behaviour?,"Hi all, I'm looking for advices, plus English is not my first language so please forgive my mistakes. Sorry for the long post

I (30f) am in a long distance relationship with my BF (38m). The issue is his mum and his behaviour. She constantly criticise him, always telling him he is not enough etc and instead of reacting he cries. At the same time she lives over his money because she is retired and her retirement money are not enough. The economical situation in his country is not good, and despite not struggling they are not rich, they simply make the ends meet. Now he is constantly wanting revenge over his country and he is always dreaming about ""when I will be rich"", ""I'll show them what I can do because the government here doesn't appreciate me"" etc., but in reality nothing has changed since we started the relationship. I feel he is more a dreamer honestly. On the other side I am more ""on the Earth"", I work hard, I got a degree in medical research and a PhD, plus good work offers, while he is a personal trainer in his on gym and for a small volleyball team. On this note, his mum keeps on telling him he is not enough for me and putting him down. He wanted to write a book about our love, he made me read some chapters and they are not good to be published, as also his editor friend told him, so now he decided to study English and my native language, five months after still no improvement on that side either, we are still speaking in his native language and he cannot say a single word in either language. He told me he received a good job offer in another country but he doesn't know if to accept because he cannot leave his mum behind because she is old and cannot make ends meet alone. At this point I don't know what to think about it, either it is a lie or why does he care so much about a person who constantly belittle him? He keeps on speaking about the day we will be together but I feel he is all about empty promises and dreams. I don't want to be the AH telling him he should stop dreaming and start focusing on real things to improve his situation, but I am also tired of him coming to me complaining about his situation. I like him but some days I feel wasting my time with him and I see no future within this relationship because he is just a ""blablabla"" and no real action. That said, would I be the AH telling him that his mum is partially right when she tells him not to waste his time on futile stuff and to put his head on the real matters?",Asshole,2024-08-19,"WIBTA to partially side with my MIL comments on my partner and their behaviour?

93,1evycn0,AITA - gym sweat cleaning fails ,"TLDR: I sweat A LOT but I thoroughly clean up after myself at the gym.  Another person sweats a lot, drinking lots of water and only pretending to clean up after. And seems to be stalking me and getting on the equipment before me no matter when I switch my time to so I asked them to clean up properly afterwards and now the gym staff, which ignored my complaints, is threatening to cancel my membership.

AITA for calling out another heavy sweater at the gym?

I am a big boy and Im trying to get into shape and i sweat .  .  .  A LOT.

Physical injuries and emotional issues  make going to a gym difficult so I try to go when the rest of the world is busy. I have to use machines bc of physical handicaps.

Another heavy sweater seems to be trying to get there just before me and use the same equipment.  This is not a big deal with two exceptions.

1. The only recumbent stationary i can use has a lake under and all over it after they are done.

2. They make no real effort to clean up after.

As a result, the floor under the stationary stays sopping wet all day after they are done until second shift staff quickly mops around it. And it stinks horribly.

Making it worse, this person drinks at least a half gallon of water during their workout, increasing the sweat output.

I always carry extra towels with me plus I use the gym supplied sprays and paper towels to clean equipment after I use it.  Especially the stationary.  And I use the gym supplied mop to remove any sweat from around. I even regularly donate cases of cleaning supplies, including odoban, to the gym, and before this have never complained about anything 

On multiple occasions, I have tried changing my gym time to different times, but it doesn’t take long before this person seems to find me and starts showing up just early enough to get on the equipment first and pouring out sweat everywhere with only a pretend wipe down after done.

I have approached the staff and have been rebuffed.  Finally I asked the person to please clean up after themselves and stop leaving a lake. And they got offended, claiming they have a condition.  To which I responded so do I but I don’t force others to swim in the after math.  Now the gym staff is threatening to cancel my gym membership.

95,1evxtzu,AITA for dropping out of college and wasting my dad’s money?,"I 20 female have been studying abroad for 2 years now. I am continents away from my family, living with a relative I had last seen when I was a child and didn’t remember at all. My living situation isn’t bad tho. I am grateful that I have my own space because I am somewhat of an organized and clean freak. I speak English fluently and don’t have an accent at all, so there wasn’t any language barrier. I am also doing good in my classes. However, I would describe myself as a social introvert. I don’t have a hard time making friends and have made a couple from my classes in college but I mostly love to be indoors. Once I have created my comfort bubble I don’t enjoy leaving it. In high school, all my friends were school friends and I would only go places with them because I was comfortable with them, we had similar interests and cultures. As for the friends I have made so far in college, apart from our classes, we don’t have similar interests, even the ones who I share a culture with.

Here is where the problem arises. I don’t feel like this is the path I want to take anymore. I am still in my second year of college and I already knew what I wanted to major in but now it all seems like a waste of time. I feel like I could be back in my home country taking professional training courses and starting to work like a lot of people my age do. Also, the field that I was going for has a minimum of 6-8 years of school and yes I would be making a lot of money after school but I don’t want to study 8 years to then work in an office. However, as an international student with no scholarships or financial aid, my dad has already spent almost 25,000$ for 4 semesters to cover courses, insurance, and extra fees. This is a huge amount and I do feel bad even though my dad, who didn’t raise me and came back in my life while I was in high school, has been the main push toward this career choice and more of a college bank than anything else. I also feel like I was pressured by my mom and dad to make a decision for my future because I took a semester off after my senior year as I didn’t want to make the wrong decision. Now that it is made, I feel like it’s the wrong one. It just feels like I wasted two years of my life taking classes and staying quarantined in my room. I would rather go home, take a shorter vocational study, start working, and eventually pay my dad back for what he invested in me. I feel like college is for figuring out what you want to do in life so if I were to change my mind now would be the time because the path I'm on now looks like it leads to a miserable, rich life which isn’t what I want. I am scared because I don’t want to regret the decision I will make like I regret the path I'm on now.

97,1evxil7,AITA for bringing up voice recordings to my stepdaughter from her late mom during marriage counseling? ,"I (36f) have been married to my husband Nate (40m) for the last 7 years. My stepdaughter Jessie (14f) is from Nate's first marriage. Nate's first wife passed away when Jessie was 3. In her final months she recorded messages for Jessie. She put the audio on her old computer, an old MP3 for Jessie, on a couple of flash drives and Nate has backups, his late wife's parents have a backup, so do her sister and brother.

I was aware of the voice messages when Nate and I were still very new. He talked about them and how important they had become to Jessie, who was 5 when Nate and I met. He also told me he wasn't looking for a new mom/parent for Jessie. He wanted a partner to be more of a fun family member and support. This person could not force or push the relationship. That his late wife's shoes could not be filled. I agreed, and told him being a fun family member sounded great.

Nate's inconsistent about my role in Jessie's life since we married. Jessie doesn't want me to be her parent but sometimes Nate does. There are times where she's having a bad day or she's sick and if Nate's at work or not home, she doesn't come to me, she just plays the voice recordings of her mom. It makes me feel very useless because if Nate is around and stays home with her when she's sick or he's around when she's sad, she cuddles with him (in the past, when sick) or looks for comfort and reassurance from him. She still listens to her voice notes but not as much. Whereas she'll tell me she's fine. She has lied to my face and said nothing was wrong and even if I could see she wasn't and tried to offer some comfort she'd brush me off and listen to the voice notes. But Nate and his family would complain when I wasn't staying home with her. I told him I felt useless being home with her he told me it's because I wasn't her parent and she didn't need me like him.

Nate brought up concerns that after all these years Jessie and I aren't close. We started marriage counseling to talk through everything. He said his biggest concern was the fact he does not feel like I have made any progress in my relationship with Jessie and like I'm too hands off. I said I am there for Jessie as much as she wants me to be. But I'm not forcing like I was told. And there's very few things Jessie will say yes to doing with me or coming to me with. Typically she'll be fine coming to the store with me or asking me to drive her to the store. She's good watching Disney movies with me. Or playing some video games with me. But she doesn't come to me with her problems and when I offer help she doesn't want it. I told him I don't really know what he expects. And that when I'm the only person available when she's not doing good, she turns to the voice recordings. Nate accused me of being jealous and said said bringing up the voice notes in marriage counseling was wrong and made it sound like I wanted to get rid of them. I never said that. But he told me they never needed to be mentioned.

98,1evxemc,WIBTA if I asked my friend to not copy my sign idea for a concert? ,"
Howdy yall, this situation may seem simple or stupid to some, but it's causing me to overthink a lot Imao.
Some backstory:
So two of my friends and I are going to a concert in a week that we are all very excited to go to! I bought my ticket almost 9 months ago, so l've been looking forward to this since then. I have also been listening to this artist for a good few years, and have always wanted to see them live! The original plan was for my best friend and I to go to this show, but last minute we invited our other good friend to tag along with us. In prep for this concert, l've been brainstorming ideas for a sign I could bring to get this artist attention. I came up with a whole list of sign ideas, but there is one sign in particular that I thought of MONTHS ago and have my heart set on that l intend to make for the concert. I told myself I wouldn't share my sign idea to others who are also going (with the exception of my friends thinking they would want to do their own signs) so there aren't duplicate signs going around while at the concert. Little issue though.
As soon as I showed the other friend my sign idea, she was immediately on board with the sign idea and said she also wanted to make that sign uh oh. Bro! I showed you a whole list (with like 15 other ideas) and TOLD YOU which one I am doing, and you ALSO want to do that one? I'm sorry but I don't know if I can do it. I clarified to her that this is a very personal and meaningful idea that I would like to execute since it is special and sentimental to me. and either she understood the memo and is just ignoring it, or it went right over her head (I'm not sure which it is tbh) but she keeps pressing saying she wants us to both have the same sign (no, not share one, two separate ones) when I really don't want that. I also gave her the option to pick from any of the other sign ideas I thought of. Obviously, I can't stop her from making a sign, but what I can do is prevent unwanted tension throughout our whole trip. Would I be the asshole if I were to ask her a second time to not have the same sign as me (except way more firm?)

Also I know I'm going to get the ""don't bring a sign to a concert blah blah” comment. It's going to be a very small printer size sheet of paper I plan on holding in front of me, so don't get the wrong idea lmao. Also I will be deleting this within a few days or so regardless of who is and isn’t the asshole lmfao, so thank you kindly.

Obviously, I can't stop her from making a sign, but what I can do is prevent unwanted tension throughout our whole trip. Would I be the asshole if I were to ask her a second time to not have the same sign as me (except way more firm?)

Also I know I'm going to get the ""don't bring a sign to a concert blah blah” comment. It's going to be a very small printer size sheet of paper I plan on holding in front of me, so don't get the wrong idea lmao. Also I will be deleting this within a few days or so regardless of who is and isn’t the asshole lmfao, so thank you kindly. ",1.0,1.0110758543014526,1,1
99,1evxaw2,AITA for ignoring my ex when he is clearly not doing well? ,"Side note: I decided to make this second account to post this as I didn’t want to post it on my main, in case you were wondering why this account is so new. 

I (17f) dated my ex (17m) for about 4 months at the beginning of this year. We broke up in May as I felt the whole relationship was rushed but I also felt he was more ready for a serious relationship than I was.

After the breakup he texted and called non stop to the point I blocked his number (but not his socials). We are in a friend group together and everyone and I mean everyone (even my best friend) in the group has always been on his side, all my friends in this group are in relationships that have lasted for over a year so they definitely have a better grasp of relationships than I do, but I don’t agree with them about this situation. Most of our friends think I need to try to be close with him again for the sake of the group but I honestly don’t want too. 

He struggles with mental health issues as well and used to confide in me about it a lot, so I worry for his well-being but honestly, I’m getting a bit tired of this. Last night he called me 13 times (on Snapchat) completely out of the blue, but I slept through this. 

Then he showed up at my house at 1:00 AM. I was asleep and woke up to my dad freaking out on him since my window was open. He left no longer than a minute after I woke up, but my dad said he had been there for at least 10 minutes trying to get me to come outside. My parents are livid now.

I don’t know who is right here, the guy is really fragile mentally and I don’t want to hurt him but as cruel as it sounds I’m sick of dealing with this. I feel it’s important to note is diagnosed with anxiety and depression. 

My parents and sister are telling me I need to end all contact with him but the friend group we share which includes my literal best friend, say I need to remain friends with him and work things out. My friends outside of this friend group think i think to stop all contact as well and I honestly agree. 

My dad already went to his house this morning to talk to his parents and from what he told me his parents didn’t seem to think it was a big deal (they are pretty laid back). I just want him to get help but I don’t really want to be the one to help him even though I’m pretty much the reason he needs help in the first place. 

Also, he has texted me a few times today but nothing crazy. He basically just said my dad is a jerk for yelling at him and interfering with our business. 

So, AITA?

100,1evx7b1,AITA for refusing to change my birthday celebration plans after my boyfriend asked me to?,"
I (25F) will be turning 26 in September, and birthdays have always been a bit sensitive for me. In the past, they often haven't lived up to expectations, so now I usually plan small things with a few close friends. This year, I was planning to celebrate with my boyfriend (who I've been with for a year) and some friends. We were planning to go to a spa I've wanted to visit for a long time on the Friday before my birthday, and my friends and I also have plans for Saturday.

My boyfriend is Muslim, and his sister’s wedding (which I can’t attend) happens to fall on my birthday. I don’t expect him to miss the wedding at all, but when he asked me to move our plans to another weekend, I explained that I couldn’t because my friends and I have already used our last vacation days for this specific weekend. I suggested that we could still do something together on Friday and celebrate again another weekend, but he got upset and said that this was ""pointless"" and a ""waste of time."" He doesn’t want to miss out on the Saturday activities, but I don't want to miss them either—although I feel like it’s just something we’ll have to accept given the circumstances.

I even suggested going a day early, on Thursday, so that we could spend time together and he wouldn’t miss anything on Saturday. His response was, “Just do what you want” and “I wish you all the best.” Now, I’m left feeling like I might be selfish for sticking to my original plans.

101,1evx25p,AITA for not performing at my ex-friends wedding?,"A friend of mine of nearly 10 years recently got engaged and started planning a wedding for summer of 2025. 
She asked me to be her bridesmaid at the wedding and I happily said yes. 
When planning the wedding I asked if they would prefer a traditional wedding gift, or would they want some assistance with the wedding. I am a singer at a wedding band, and we have performed for free for friends and family before and we offered to play a set in exchange for food. She was very exited about the idea.

However, at the engagement party, I got into a huge fight with the fiance. To the point in which my friend kicked me out of the wedding party. And later the entire wedding. It's fine. I couldn't pretend to be happy for them at the wedding, it's their day, if they don't want me there, it's okay. 

I however assumed that since I am no longer welcome at the wedding, I am not required to give a gift either. My former friend (her words) insisted that since they had ""booked"" us, we are required to perform at her wedding. For free. I told her that we only perform for free for friends and family, and even they pay for accommodation and travel as well as provide us with food at the event. If she wants us to perform, it'll be the standard fee since we are not friends. We have an opening to take the wedding, but we are not doing for free.
Since that she has bath mouthed us to all our mutual friends. They think that in order to keep the peace, we should just do it, as we had promised.
Am I the asshole here for not wanting to give an expensive value gift to someone who no-longer consideres me to be her friend?

My bf hates light being left on for no reason because he thinks it’s a waste of electricity. This includes even if you leave for just five seconds to get something, he expects it to be turned off, or he will. He does it every time I leave the room without fail, knowing that I will be back seconds later. If I’m leaving and not returning, I’ll turn it off. But if I forgot something or need to get something, it makes no sense to turn it off if I am returning seconds later.

So one night I was in the bedroom getting ready to settle for the night. I realised I left my phone at the dining table so go to get. I return and find the bedroom light off. This had happened so many times that I decide to approach him about it.

I ask him why he turned the light off. He replied that I had left the room and was wasting electricity. I tell him I had forgotten my phone and was retrieving it. That when I returned I was getting into bed to read so the lights would need to be on. I tell him I find it frustrating that it happens every time I leave a room for a second and ask him not to do it again. He says nothing. I take it that the convo has ended and go back to the room.

He storms in 5 seconds after saying how dare I start a fight with him about this. I ask him how I was fighting with him, when all I did was request he stopped turning off the lights when he knows I’m using the room. He gets in my face and says the second I start paying for electricity I can leave the lights on for as long as I want. That until that happens leaving the lights is disrespectful to him and he cannot believe he even has to explain this to me.

103,1evwptm,AITA for going to my boyfriend house and not really feeling sorry about it?,"To preface, my boyfriend and i got into a huge argument. I had asked him why he was still following this girl on instagram whom i felt very uncomfortable with. The girl and her friends were making videos on tiktok dissing me and they would send me random weird messages on instagram. The girl had also asked him to go to a dance event for the club they are both in, to which i didnt even know she asked him personally till weeks after the event happened. He explained that he cant cut her off because she is part of his friend group and that they are in the same major at school. I got angry because it didn't make sense to me as i was simply asking him to remove her as i felt uncomfortable. (This was her ""spam"" account he was following/she was following him with, i only asked he unfollowed her ""spam"" account, not her main, cause yeah i understand the whole thing about her being part of his friend group).

Our argument spiraled and it got even more tense. In the midst of it i asked him if he could pick me up from somewhere as i didnt have my car and i wasnt up to be where i was anymore. He had said something along the lines of ""why would i pick you up"". At the moment i was annoyed and angry so l had replied saying one of my guy friends (who he was uncomfortable with) can pick me up instead. I followed up by saying it wasnt actually true. I said this to spite him and make him angry. I know this was out of pocket and wrong for me to say. My anger doesn't justify it. Due to me saying this he accused me of cheating and blocked me on everything. He continued to tell my friends, my family, and his friends that i cheated on him. He did not let me contact him for days and would constantly tell my friends/family that i was a h*e. I personally do not feel like i cheated, i definitely agree it was disrespectful and not my place to say something like that.

A couple days after, I went to his house and rang the doorbell a few times. I then knocked on the door. His mom and dad came out the house to which i told them that i needed to speak to his son. They kept on saying he didnt want to talk. They went back inside for a few minutes then came outside telling me i should leave. I told them that i needed to talk to him as he was continuously messaging my family and friends but he would not let me speak to him. I was under the impression that he would basically never speak to me again.

He proceeds to tell me days later that i ruined the whole relationship due to me cheating and due to me making his parents hate me. And for a little backstory, his dad was never a fan of me from the start. His dad would constantly tell my boyfriend to find other girls or to go on dating apps. His dad never had respect for me. He proceeds for message for days calling me a wh*re who only seeks males attention. 

Now he wants to talk everything out?? And he wants us to still be together and work it out. To add: he told me that when i came to his house, he told his parents to not interact with me as i was crazy.

I (22M) have been dating my girlfriend (21F) for about a year. I know that she went through a traumatic event in high school, and her older brother (24M), who is a big guy and a dedicated boxer, was the one who saved her during that time. Since then, she’s become extremely close to him.

Recently, she’s been spending a lot of time at his house, especially when she’s feeling unwell or stressed. I’ve noticed that she only feels comfortable wearing certain outfits—like those she would wear only at home where she feels most relaxed—when she’s at his place. She says it’s because she feels safe and at ease there, which she doesn’t feel anywhere else.

She’s also mentioned that once she finishes college and starts her career, she plans to spoil her brother as a way to thank him for everything he’s done.

Yesterday, she sent me messages but Mia told me not to read them yet since I'm not ready to properly communicate and might get into another argument. She said I should read them later when emotions aren't flying around and there's lower risk of escalation.

This morning, Kate called me an ass for not reading and replying. She said I am being cold-hearted in my approach and said that avoiding her isn't going to solve anything.",4.0,0.01625342294573784,0,0
107,1evwgmw,AITA for telling my husband it’s not ok he worked a 12 hour day on my birthday?,"It’s my birthday today. For the other 51 Mondays of the year, my husband has been home before dinner. Today he left at 6am, just home at 6pm.

For all other birthdays in our family we (I?) always make it special. Cake for breakfast, early and fun dinner out (simple yet fun to make the person feel it’s a special day).

He told me last week he’d booked this job in for today. I said “oh that’s my birthday”. He said he hadn’t looked at the date, so didn’t realise it was my birthday. He said his client was getting the keys to his new house today, so he wanted all the electrical work done (husband is an electrician) and had booked in 2 other ppl to work with him. He said “we’ll get something for dinner”.

5pm comes, the kids are hungry, toilet training 3 year old is grumpy and I literally can’t cook anything other than boiled eggs and toast safely while I have him on my hip. To add insult to injury he’s just been away for 2 days cos I told him he looked exhausted and needed a break.

He works hard to maintain the finances for our family. I had a big corporate job before kids which I had to leave when we had them (or else I’d never see them). But I have worked my a$$ off teaching myself a new profession and have just started turning a profit. I’m so mentally exhausted and my youngest is so attached to me I can’t even use the restroom without him touching me (bless his heart). Pre kids I had lots of social interaction. I loved it. I feel so isolated and I often go a full day or more without talking to someone over the age of 5. He knows I struggle with this.

AITA for being angry at my husband for working all day on my birthday? Feeling so gutted I had to take a walk when he came home and left the kids to him.

Ps. Probably could’ve prepared a better dinner but I’m too gutted and I’m all over their nutrition the other 364 days of the year. It’s all I had the energy to muster.

109,1evwfcc,WIBTA for using a baby name for my next child that I love.,"Basically this occurred a few years ago after I had my daughter. My sisters close friend at the time was doing my makeup for some photos and had asked why I named my daughter the name that I did because it was not very common. I said it was because it was special to me as my mom chose it. But the original name I wanted to use was something else. She began to pry and I told her that in the future I’d use the name if I had another girl since I loved that it rhymed with my daughters name. She had also pryed about other personal things with her father I wasn’t wanting to discuss so I was already feeling uncomfortable. 

For context my sister and I both have rhyming names and I wanted to make that a tradition. My sisters friend later got pregnant and used the baby name I had told her I loved and because of how uncommon it was I knew she got it from me because she had actually wrote it down in her phone in front of me upon me telling her saying “I like that” and saying “I’ve never heard that before how did you think of that”. 

Anyway, I mentioned in a post that if I had a daughter I’d still use the name. My thought was that my sisters friend isn’t family and a name is just a name. I heard through the grape vine how she apparently “claimed” this name and I just laughed it off because she isn’t in my intermediate circle. This situation came up in my mind recently when my partner and I have been discussing having children more heavily and he loves the name I would like to use for a girl.

110,1evwe9k,"AITA - my ex is attending my best friend’s wedding, i don’t think i’ll go","Two years ago, I dated someone and discovered a little late into the relationship that he was abusive. Mentally and psychologically abusive. He wanted a housewife - perfect, pretty, and quiet. He would say that he didn't love me if i refused to be intimate with him. I could go on. When I finally decided to leave him, I had to block his number, his social media accounts, even his email. Still, he created fake accounts to continue interacting with me. Harassing my friends. It took nearly 6 months for him to stop. I thought I could finally move on.

Now, when I dated him, I had introduced him to my best friend and her fiancé. He and her fiancé hit it off.

I found out that my ex continued his friendship with my friend and her fiancé. Later, I find out that he is attending their wedding. And if that's not enough to grapple with, my friend refused me a plus-one, and made no guarantees that my ex wouldn't have one, even though he was single when we had the conversation a few months ago. And my boyfriend of just shy of 1 year can't attend. Because she doesn't know him. He lives out of state, and I have tried to invite her to get together with us when he's visited, and she has shown no interest.

Then, I learn that not only is he attending the wedding, he is officiating it. And not from my friend, but from a girl at the bachelorette party, who I could tell realized late that she wasn't supposed to tell me. My friend was never going to tell me. I would have found out during the ceremony.

And his new girlfriend of one month, who looks eerily like me, is tagging my friend in posts online. So, I have a hunch she'll be at the wedding with my ex.

I've know my friend since 7th grade. 16 years now. And we've been through A LOT together. I considered her my best friend for years. But now I don't even want to attend her wedding.

He has also come over to our place twice with his dog just to make sure they're cool on each others turf. The last few weeks Jake has been having some people over doing improvements on his property who had a puppy. These people asked Jake if he could take their puppy cuz they couldn't care for it. He said yes. And now Jake is afraid the his dog might get overly protective of the the new puppy. (Jake's dog is a mix with German Shepherd and our is a pure border collie who is NOT dominant dog. He’s to dog that, despite being socialized, doesn’t like other dogs barking.) Since then, Jake's dog actually has gotten very protective of the puppy (even towards him), confirming his fears. While telling everyone at my husband work that he got a puppy my husband was shocked and asked if 3 dogs is too much. Jake froze and stammered (according to my husband).

112,1evwbb0,AITA for hanging out with someone alone outside of the friend group?,"To preface, this happened around a year ago but the way it ended was confusing so i’m turning to reddit for opinions. 

I (f) was living with two other females in a small dorm room on our campus. One of my roommates was my best friend and the other was a random person we found to fill the third bed in our room. From the moment we met her she had been a little inconsistent from what she described herself as but we didn’t think anything of it. 

We became relatively close and enjoyed campus events together for a little bit until things went downhill. Me and her went to the dining hall alone one day for dinner and while in line we met this boy, John, and his roommate, Chris. I asked them to sit with us for dinner and they agreed and we all sat down. We were all talking about random things when John asked me for my contact information. This sparked my roommate to pull out her phone and get his info too so it was just a group exchange. We had agreed to all hang out as a group again soon and we all left. 

Later, John texts me and asks me to hang out separately from the group and I agreed. We went to a coffee shop in our college town and talked for a while and it was kinda cute, I was really starting to like him. When I got home I was met with a pretty upset roommate. She said that i had “gone behind her back” and hung out with a boy that i “knew she liked”. I figured since i had invited him to eat with me and he had asked me for my number then it was pretty clear to her that we were relatively interested in each other. I told her that I was sorry but also wasn’t entitled to tell her where i was going at a given time. I didn’t think she was into him so it wasn’t like i was sneaking around. Also, it was kind of spur of the moment when he asked me to hang out so i wasn’t talking about it with anyone, it just happened.

Ultimately, I decided to keep seeing this boy. We had a lot of fun and we have the same music taste and interests, it was nice. But, My roommate saw us hanging out one day and lectured me when i got to the dorm about how i am a liar and i should have never continued to hang out with him after she told me she liked him. However, this boy clearly has no interest in her, as he had been texting me to hang out ever since. 

I stopped seeing him because she made such a fuss about it and even texted him and his roommate about me saying weird things. Me and my roommate never made up. We lived in the same room but we didn’t even talk. It wasn’t terrible despite her disrespectful manners regarding shared spaces. We just existed in the same room and never talked about it. A couple months after the fight, she just moved out without saying anything. 

I will admit that us never talking about it may seem silly but also i feel like there was nothing that could have been said. This boy we met was interested in me and i pursued my own interest independently from this random girl i met a month prior. So, am I the asshole?

114,1evw1r8,"AITAH for going to a ""party"" without my boyfriend because he wasn't invited?","I was invited to a ""party"", I say in quotes  because it was simply a gathering with food among friends, friends that I have known for 7-10 years before we head off to college. My boyfriend is not part of this friend group and doesn't like one specific guy who is attending. We have already discussed this guy and how I will not interact with him no matter what. He was still very adamant about me not going but I went anyways because I do not know the next time I will be able to see my friends. 
Prior to attending he asked me to not do a part of my shower routine and if i did, it would mean that I intent to cheat on him.

He continued to say how I shouldn't have gone since we both weren't invited and there was another couple at the party so it's unfair. Even though we do not share the same friend group, there are some people he knows attending, I said it's ultimately up to the host and that was his decision, he blames it on the one guy who he does not like influencing the rest of the group.

The other couple is a couple within the friend group
I have never cheated or done anything close
He says he trusts me but also says I'm going to cheat?

I was invited to a ""party"", I say in quotes  because it was simply a gathering with food among friends, friends that I have known for 7-10 years before we head off to college. My boyfriend is not part of this friend group and doesn't like one specific guy who is attending. We have already discussed this guy and how I will not interact with him no matter what. He was still very adamant about me not going but I went anyways because I do not know the next time I will be able to see my friends. 
Prior to attending he asked me to not do a part of my shower routine and if i did, it would mean that I intent to cheat on him.

She knew I applied and never said anything. Then the interview came and she was great and supportive. While she liked the job and what I said about it we never talked about her coming. I figured that it was good to interview, even if I didn’t get the job I was networking. 

After the job offer, she got mad and threw a fit. Under no circumstance was she moving to Goodland, KS. I didn’t get mad but she wanted to escalate. Telling me that if I moved to Kansas, she was leaving me. She left and went to her place. 

I tried calling her for the next few days but silence and I had to give this company an answer. I agreed to take the job and started the process of moving. I had been out of work for a month and they wanted me to start asap so it could be a quick move. After two weeks the movers picked up my furniture and my friends had a going away party. I was mad and didn’t particularly tell her I was moving in my texts. I also didn’t reach out to her friends and family to tell them. I just left. 
After a week she called to ask if we could talk. I said I was in Kansas, she replied with “what about me”?

I told her that she said if I moved to Kansas we were done and never gave me a chance to talk so I moved to Kansas and I thought she knew what that meant for her.

I called up asked for a tape review on where this money went which after 15 minutes of being wrapped up on the phone turns out (drum rolls please) SHE PUT IT AWAY IN HER CASH DRAWER!!!!!
SO I turned around and told her ""you put it away."" She then told me ""NO! not that 150 this one!!""

I pay out slots 9 K Jackpot finally. So I zip back to her and tell her you put that one away as well. And she starts to yell at me about how she's going to be off and it's all my fault and she doesn't believe me so I snapped ""You wanna start yelling? I'll yell. I found YOUR money that YOU put away.

119,1evuo79,WIBTA if I move my daughter's room when she moves away for college,"Background - My husband and I have lived together for 11 years. We have three children, two daughters Anna (F21) and Beth (F18) from his first marriage and Charlie (M14) from my first marriage. We have lived in the same house for those 11 years. Due to their mother's mental health, the girl have lived full time with us since Anna was in the middle of the 6th grade. We gave Anna first pick of rooms and she chose the largest (non-master) room in the house that is in the basement. Beth took the other large room in the basement. This left Charlie with a small room upstairs. I thought I made it clear to the house that as they left for college their rooms would be up for grab. They would always have a room in my house, just not guaranteeing it would be the one they currently occuplied.

Anna moved into campus housing her sophmore year in college. She attends a local university but lives on campus. When she did I moved my office down to her room. I work from home and the dogs were driving me crazy upstairs, barking at everyone that walked past our busy street. Before I moved furniture, I asked Beth if she wanted the large room. She declined so I took over.

Later on Beth asked if we could paint her room and I agreed. I did ask that she pick a gender neutral color so that I wouldn't have to repaint in case Charlie moved downstairs.

Here comes where I might be the asshole ... Beth is getting ready to move out to college, 2.5 hours away. And she is upset/mad that she is ""losing her room"". Charlie has asked to move to the basement as that room, particularly the closet, is a bit larger and he will have more space to store his stuff than his currently cramped room. For reference, Charlie has a twin bed, desk and bookshelf but no dresser as there isn't space to put one.

120,1evujxr,AITA For Buying A Lockable Storage Box To Prevent My Dad From Taking My Food?,"Hi everyone. I am a 22F college student in CA and i live at home with my parents 58M and 56F. 

For some context: 
I work a small part time job where I only work ~ 12-15 hours/week and as a result, only make around $9k a year. In other words, I’m still very much financially dependent on my parents. My dad in particular pays for my gas (~ $55/month), car insurance (~ $160/month), and has helped me previously with any leftover college tuition my student loans wouldn’t cover ($700-$200 per semester). 
I’m also obese (5’1 tall, 215 lbs) and even more important than exercise to lose weight is controlling my diet. And I hate cooking so I prefer to meal prep a weeks worth of food at a time (~ 10 meals).

The issue: 
A handful of times, my dad has taken one of my meal prepped meals for himself to take to work. And it really gets on my nerves. I work very hard to meal prep. I have to find low calorie recipes, find the actual calories by inputting all the ingredients into the myfitnesspal app, do the shopping, cooking (I’m an incredibly slow cook, so this takes me at least 4 hours weekly), rewashing the meal prep containers (bc apparently I’m the only one in the family that cares to deep clean them), and weighing out the food into equal servings. And I do all this for my weight loss/health/convenience of having a meal ready to eat when I come home from work. 

That being said, it’s really irritating to me when my dad just takes one of my meal prepped meals for himself without asking or anything. He did so again recently so I finally pulled the trigger and bought a lockable food storage box to put my meals in in the fridge. My mom has gotten upset with me saying that after all he does for me, which is indeed a lot, I could be so cold and rash. My opinion is that he should at least have the common courtesy to ask for permission. My parents argue that everything in the house is for everyone to use. I think that’s a BS argument because I’ve never taken anyone else’s lunch food they prepped without asking permission. I’d like the courtesy I’ve given others to be extended to me. 
No matter which way I’ve explained my irritation and reasoning to buying the lockable food storage box, my mom thinks I’m being selfish. And I admit that I am a bit selfish, but sometimes you have to be selfish in order to prioritize your well being as an obese person. I haven’t made any remarks to my dad nor has he made any remarks towards me about the lockable food storage box. But I am afraid that he will retaliate and stop paying for my gas and car insurance. In which case, I’ll just buy an E Bike on my credit card and make payments since I just drive in town and I’ll be able to get financial independence after I graduate this semester.

123,1evu76d,AITAH for asking to go to a concert in the US while my parents are away?,"
I (20F) currently live with my parents in Canada.

I never asked to go out much through my teenage years aside from occasional sleepovers 

I have horrible RSD so being invited places means a lot to me..
  
In the last month or so, I’ve gone from spending my weekends alone to being invited out all time.
I’ve been having a lot of fun and it’s been helping me start to feel like a real human being.. 

A girl I’ve become friends with, told me that she has tickets to go to a concert at a park just across the border and asked if I wanted to go with her, her husband and a couple others (both are in their early 30’s and my parent know/like them)

Here’s the issue.

This person texted on the night before my parents were planning on going away for a week.

We live in an old farmhouse and my grandparents live on the property in a trailer. If it was winter, me being here would be important since pipes bursting is not uncommon.
 
During the summer, “looking after things” is feeding the dogs.

The morning of the day they were leaving, I woke my mom up, I let her know about the invite, told her I’d let her know the details. I said goodbye and then headed off to work.
 
I was able to get the day off as well as the next morning.
I made the plans to crash at my friend’s place.

I was going to ask my grandparents to feed the dogs the one night. (Which they do all the time when we leave)
 
Then I got a message from my mom. she and  my dad talked about it and they didn’t want me to go, and that ""the timing sucked""

I brought up that I am 20 years old I have been a legal adult for 2 years.
I work a full time job, drive my own car, pay my own bills, etc. 

All of the usual stuff they would worry about was taken care of.

She told me that my dad was furious and ready to turn around and come home. 

She said that knowing the stress this is causing, out of love, I should cancel any plans I had made.

I felt like I was 14..
 
I asked if we could call and talk about it. 

She told me that it was irresponsible and selfish.

She said there would be ""consequences"" if I went anyways.

I decided it’s not worth the issues and
I messaged my friend saying it wasn't gonna work this time.

For the last 6 days I’ve been at home/work, feeling like an angry teenager who just got grounded.

But I can’t help but wonder if I’m overreacting 
 
If I’m being selfish and childish for wanting to do something like this while my parents are away..
 
Maybe they view me going to the US as a much bigger deal and I should be more understanding about their parental concerns.

Idk..I guess I’m just looking for either validation or for someone to tell me why I’m wrong for being angry..

124,1evtulv,AITA for asking bridesmaid to just attend destination wedding when she asked to just be a guest for my legal ceremony ,"I’m having two weddings to accommodate as many guests with different budgets as possible. 

Wedding 1 is a small one back in my home state for the wedding party and family on 2 months short notice due to pricing/availability reasons.

Wedding 2 is a bigger destination wedding next year. 

A friend who asked to be a bridesmaid (prior to me planning this first wedding on short notice), asked if she could just be a guest for this first one since it was short notice and she would only be there for 2 days and wants to have leisure time rather than following the wedding party schedule even though I let her know she could come late in the afternoon (She has a work event the day before the wedding where she needs to drive a few hours to another city so she would either get in late the night before or fly in first thing in the morning for the wedding) 

Since she is opting to skip day of wedding schedule to do her own vacation activities, it didn’t felt like she cared and I asked her if she would like to just attend the destination wedding instead, given this first wedding is just for the bridal party and family. 

She was offended by this, and proceeded to yell at me for 2 hours about how I didn’t ask her formally enough and it was too short notice and she felt like an afterthought so why should she be putting in all this effort, among other logistical reasons why she didn’t want to be a bridesmaid. 

I understand different people have different tolerances for what they can handle schedule/travel wise, but she also made a bunch of other excuses like she is not someone who books trips only 2 months out which is untrue because she just booked flights for another wedding that was less than a month away. It really felt like she was just trying to cover up the real reason why, which was that it wasn’t worth her time to be a bridesmaid. 

While I was let down, I never yelled or got mad. It was exhausting having to calm her down and our friendship has always been one sided with me putting in most of the effort (doesn’t text back a lot of times but will call or text when she needs something, Irish goodbyed on my 30th this year, will call a restaurant to add her bfs friends she has never met to her reservation but tell me she doesn’t have room for me), which is why I hesitated on asking her in the first place. 

This interaction was a confirmation of where our friendship stood with her, and i didn’t want any negative energy to be brought to my wedding day.

125,1evttfx,AITA for telling my mom ‘52F’ that her brother in law ’48M’ isn’t on my guest list for my ‘24F’ wedding? ,"Hello I’m ‘24F’ female and am getting married soon to my ‘30M’ fiancé, we’ve been together for 4.5 years now so it’s about time! We’re in the early stages of planning our wedding and things are already getting difficult with my mother. ‘52F’

I [24F] had a friend tell me that they wrote out their guest list for their wedding then gave each set of in-laws 10 invites each and they can invite whoever they want. I [24F] thought this was a wonderful idea so it would be fair and no fighting would occur… so I thought. I sent the list and I did not put my aunts new husband on there because we don’t get along and I’ve probably only met him maybe four times. If I’m being honest my aunt and I don’t have the best relationship either but we have a small one. He’s one of those men who thinks they are better than everyone at everything. He told me that I seemed like I was “one of those girls” in high school and he wouldn’t have been friends with me. (I was 19 at the time, overweight and extremely depressed when this happened) He stayed over at my parents house with my aunt while I was there along with my boyfriend for an entire weekend and never left the room to say hello to us or do introductions. (this was the first time my bf was meeting my aunt or him and they didn’t meet until 2 days later even though we were all under the same roof.) when they finally met he went up to my boyfriend and said “I’ve heard a lot about you”.. I had already warned my bf about him so he responded back “I heard a lot about you too” they haven’t spoken again since and this was 2 years ago. Both my aunt and him left me watching the kids for 5 hours when they said they were going to be there in a hour. It’s thing after thing and like I said I’ve only met him four times. My aunt and him have a really rocky relationship’s, they currently are separated, which is another reason I don’t really understand my mothers pov. He has tried to fight my grandfather before. My father doesn’t like him… my mom doesn’t even care for the dude that much… but she is mad that if she wants him at our wedding it’s going to take one of her 10 tickets. She thinks I’m singling him out and it’s rude and hurtful towards her because it’s her side of the family I’m “singling out”. 

I feel like she doesn’t understand where I’m coming from… I’m not saying he can’t come to the wedding all I’m saying is if she wants him there it comes out of your ten tickets bc i have zero interest in having him there. 

This is our wedding day… we get one day to have everyone we love In one room celebrating a joyous occasion. If I really wanted to do what I wanted he wouldn’t be invited at all but my mom wants him there. Should I put him on the guest list or keep him as one of her 10? Or should I just take him off completely?

I personally feel like if I give into this she will be doing this throughout the entire wedding process. I’m not sure what to do:/ Am I the asshole in this situation? 

Edit: money hasn’t really been discussed much since we are in the early stages. My parents are not extremely well off and my brother will be proposing to his gf this time next year so for a short period of time there will be two weddings to be paying for. I think at the least my parents will pay for my wedding dress at the most the rehearsal dinner too. I expect that my fiancé and I will be paying for the majority of our wedding alone.

Ever since I have been here, I have been helping my family nonstop. My dad complains, cusses, and then asks me for help. When he gets help, he gets angry and berates you as you help him. He talks me to about others in my family and I give him advice, he gets angry at my advice. 

I’ve been taking the dogs to the vet, grabbing my family food, driving my dad around, and watching my niece. 

My brother and my sister still live with my parents. My brother leaves his daughter at my parent’s house as he goes to the hookah lounge to do some work. My niece is very active and hyper. She does not listen, screams for no reason, etc. She may have severe ADHD or something else not diagnosed because my brother and her mother do not want to take her to a psychiatrist or psychologist or they don’t have the money for it. I think both.

I watched her until Saturday afternoon. Did not get time to myself today because of an all day family event. I was doing some work this evening while watching tv with my family. Through out the whole time I’ve been at the house tonight my dad has been yelling at my mom telling her she needs to be more invested in the cruise. She asks what she should do and he says f it. He keeps asking me for help with his trip and is just doing too much through it all. 

My brother comes home and we are on the couch with one of the big dogs in between us. He starts grabbing her foot and biting it softly. She tells him to stop because she doesn’t like it. He growls back at her and says she is bad then lifts his hand at her and says be quiet. I tell him to stop bothering the dog. This happens a few times. I keep telling him to stop being abusive to the dog so he does not make her a reactive dog. I am supposed to be taking the dog soon and he won’t have any responsibility for that. She also could bite him now. We already have some trouble with her with the other dogs and has bit one of them when the other gets too hyper or say they all are barking at a squirrel which is why I am taking her back with me. He does not listen to me though.

Then someone lets the dogs outside and I don’t know who. They need to be watched while outside to prevent any fighting. So, I ask as I am heading your way the stairs if anyone let the dogs out. Then my mom is standing in the kitchen taking a bit of food saying “No, you go watch them.” I assumed she had let them out. I groaned loudly and said why is no one watching the dogs.

My sister says “I’ll watch them since you clearly need to go to bed.” I said thank you. Then someone asks me why I am I upset and I say because you are all doing too much. And, my brother starts getting on my case saying that I’m doing too much and that I have been acting horrible all night.

132,1evt179,AITA to want to contact HR?,"I(26f) started working for a clinic back in June. I work up front with a girl I’ll call F(f36). When I started this position, I had just swapped from another office ran by the same corp. so I pretty much knew the ins and outs. F made several backhanded comments about me already knowing how to do everything. I would joke and laugh with F and Everything was cordial. Until about a week in I noticed f and another girl constantly messaging back and forth through our private messaging application. It was almost always after I had accidentally messed up something. F ALSO messes up the same things daily...easily correctable mistakes like forgetting to file something, or mis-hearing a patients name. I caught wind that it was me she was msging about when I walked over to the printer and saw F typing a message about how I must need a tutor. I ignored this. Maybe if I worked harder and made less mistakes things would get easier. 
That’s until F started making more slighted comments at me. (I weigh 160 on a good day, F weighs around 360-370.) I replied to something she said about gaining a ton of weight on a particular medication with “yeah, I gained a ton on that too.” And F then replied with “So you must think im a whale huh?” And I denied this and tried to laugh the awkwardness off.
A week later, F ridiculed me in front of a lobby full of pts bc I made an error that caused the system to not check in one someone. The place the pt was sitting was out of my line of sight so I didn’t even notice her waiting there for 30 minutes. F told me that I needed to pay more attention and that I needed to work harder to stop messing up. I felt stupid and even cried on the ride home.
The next day, I F pull me aside and ask if “I had a problem with her”. I denied this and said that I didn’t feel like this was the appropriate time to speak about it (middle of day, lots of patients). F rolled her eyes, rolling her chair away from me and grumbling under her breath. Later that day, I spoke w/my manager about the situation and she backed my worries w/a solution. We will all talk in the presence of her. That never happened.
Before we could have this ""meeting"" F pulled me aside and patronizingly told me that she wished I would’ve just talked to her and that she “honestly thought I had a problem with black people” as she was black herself. I can’t think of anything I did that would remotely make her think that of me. also…I’m terrible at confrontations, so I just sat and nodded and shook my head hoping it would be over already. She hugged me, said she we were cool and we went about our day. I guess she told my manager we were cool. She never apologized.




Fast forward to today. F STILL makes references to when “I was always in a mood” or when “I hated her."" She plays it off as she is joking.

133,1evsurt,"AITA for going off on a guy who called me an ""ungrateful shit""?","A year and some change ago, I(16F but at the time 15) went to a school in my freshman year where I met a guy who I'll call Adam. He always complimented me, looked at me from across the room, etc. At the end of the school year, he asked for my number. I was flabbergasted and so were his friends. His excuse for asking was so he could tell me jokes over the summer. His excuse was hella lame, but since I didn't want to embarrass him in front of his friends and was as spineless as a damn jellyfish back then, I said sure. Couldn't be that bad, right? Boy, was I wrong.

First thing was how it'd take him forever and two days to respond. I can understand being busy but 10-12 hours? Damn. Second thing was him trying to reason with weird ""hormonal"" teen boys. Told him about this weirdo I knew and he said he's sorry but when boys are around ""a pretty developed girl"" like me, they're just going to act that way. Wtf? Third thing was when he did answer, he'd reply like he didn't understand what you said. Could've asked him, ""What's your favorite color?"" and he would've answered with ""maybe"". YOU CAN'T ANSWER THAT KIND OF QUESTION WITH A MAYBE!!!

The last week of school, I was out of town. Wasn't allowed to stay in the hotel room alone so I was sitting in the lobby all day on my phone and decided to text Adam. Might as well use of one those ""summer jokes"", right? He answered and we spoke for a bit. He knew I was out of town and was incredibly bored. Perfect time for him to shoot his shot and tell me a joke. Asked him if he could entertain me. He lost his goddamn mind and said and I quote, ""Why you sounding like an ungrateful shit?""  
  
My face scrunched up so hard the people walking past me probably thought I was constipated. I asked him what the hell did he just say. When I tell you he repeated himself word for word, bar for bar, with the same exact grammatically incorrect question.... At that point, I was fed up and went off on him, telling him how rude he was and stupid he sounded. He didn't apologize so I just blocked him. Later that night, I asked him if he wanted to apologize. He put a random emoji. Alright. Blocked for good this time.

Next school year, I changed schools because that one sucked. Had to take two buses to get there and my first bus dropped me off at my old school so guess who I saw first day of school. Yep. I looked him dead in the eyes and he smiled and said hope you had a good summer. I scoffed and I asked him if that's all he had to say. He gave me a pathetic ""sorry"". Even his friends were like ""Dude, what you'd do to her?"" I just left.

This March, I was waiting for my bus. He was passing and stopped in front of me to say ""I'm so sorry"" with what I'm guessing was a straight face. I wanted to laugh so bad because he really waited nine months after being rude to genuinely apologize. I just stared at him until he walked away. Now that I'm a junior and a bit more mature, I'm wondering if maybe I was too dramatic or mean.

134,1evsrhp,AITA for blowing up at my roommate?,"A little bit of backstory first - I (25X) have two roommates, we'll call them Rae (26F) and Tess (26X). Rae suffers from anxiety, Tess suffers from depression, I suffer from bipolar. Rae and Tess are dating, and I have pretty bad abandonment issues. This effectively means I'm a third wheel in my own house, and it has a tendency to make me feel unwelcome because we argue, either of them will defend the other because they're partners.

I'm a very social human, and I can be annoying and pestilent. I try my best to keep it tempered, but I'll often interrupt what they're doing by sharing memes, talking over a video one of them was really interested in, so on and so forth. I have a difficult time knowing what they want to pay attention to, and it can be hard for me to tell when one of them is overstimulated and for what reason. I always try to be considerate.

This morning, I came out to hang out with them. Each time I came into the living room, it seemed as though my presence there made Rae feel overwhelmed. She would often retract inward and do some sort of activity alone with Tess because me also being there was too much for her to handle. It's understandable for her to need one-on-one time with her girlfriend, but that time being hosted in the living space where I socialize with them made me feel unwelcome several times. Eventually, Rae was playing a game and Tess and I were both talking about it at the same time. Rae broke down again because she was overwhelmed.

I tried, as I always do, to try to help in any way I could. In hopes of helping us understand each other better in the moment, I try to get us all communicating about our feelings, why we have them, where they come from, that sort of thing. Rae had communicated earlier that she felt like she couldn't express any negative emotion without me or Tess breaking down. That's when I spoke, and Rae cut me off before I could say anything, with a sharp ""Just don't talk, OP. I don't need to hear about how we're all feeling."" This set me off.

Earlier in the morning I'd had to remove myself from the living room several times to keep myself from making a scene because of my own mental issues, and now I was being directly targeted and effectively being told that my input wasn't respected. I responded with a dull ""Fine,"" followed by leaving, going to my room, locking my door, and kicking my chair. This may sound like a horrendous tantrum to you, but I hope you understand that this is a debilitating mental condition I deal with, and a hereditary one. This obviously set Rae off even further, and she and Tess talked it out while I was away.

Rae eventually apologized, and I explained to her how I was feeling: like I couldn't rely on anyone in my house to stand up for me when I'm in a vulnerable position, and thusly like I'm the lowest priority individual in the household by default.

Recently, however, something has come up that I find very hurtful, and she doesn’t seem to care about. Here is what’s happening.

Now I have been back home and was talking to my gf about picking her up from the airport (which I assumed I would be doing) and she said not to worry, her friend would be picking her up and they’d spend the day together. When I expressed that this hurt my feelings she didn’t understand at all. In her defense, in about a month her friend will be moving away and we will likely only see her once every few years. I have already told my gf I am fine with her spending more time with her friend than me during this month, I just really wanted to see her the day she landed and assumed I’d take priority. My girlfriend says she only has one month with the friend and the rest of her life with me, and also mentioned that she has seen me more recently than the friend. I have no problem with the friend taking priority for the rest of the month, I just thought she’d be more excited to spend her first day back with me.

When I expressed that this hurt my feelings she didn’t understand at all. In her defense, in about a month her friend will be moving away and we will likely only see her once every few years. I have already told my gf I am fine with her spending more time with her friend than me during this month, I just really wanted to see her the day she landed and assumed I’d take priority. My girlfriend says she only has one month with the friend and the rest of her life with me, and also mentioned that she has seen me more recently than the friend. I have no problem with the friend taking priority for the rest of the month, I just thought she’d be more excited to spend her first day back with me. AITA?",4.0,1.057756781578064,1,0

I was living between my place and staying at my girlfriend’s alternate weeks. It was a tough time for everyone as the kid’s mother was telling my kids I was having an affair with my new girlfriend and there was a lot of animosity. I was trying to establish a new living arrangement/life in my small, 2 bedroom place, and working in my relationship with my children and new girlfriend.

My new girlfriend’s flat was going to be sold, so she had 3 months to find a place. I did not offer her and her 3 kids to move in with me and my kids as my place was too small, it was too soon in the relationship, and I was trying to help her find a new rental she could afford. She did not get a place, and had to move into her family’s shed with her kids. She was very upset that I did not offer her a place to stay, and has resented me ever since. I explained it was not ideal for us to move in so quickly, especially while we were navigating a new relationship, issues with my divorce, and taking my children’s feelings into consideration. She tells me I don’t care her and her kids are living in a tent in a freezing shed, and made me feel terribly guilty, not supportive and not loving.

She was also upset I had offered my newly-divorced friend to stay at my place for a weekend while I wasn’t there, and my friend from interstate to stay with me for a weekend. She feels upset I would offer to my friends, and not her and her kids when I knew they were uncomfortable in their living arrangements. This happened a couple of years ago, and she brings it up whenever we have an argument, as proof I don’t care about her and never did. I felt terribly guilty, and considered all her points and offered her to live at my place, which she said I was only doing it because she was making me feel bad.

During the trip my sis frequently bossed me around making me do things she didnt wanna do herself like asking a waiter for the WiFi password or turning on devices, while she sat texting or FT her BF. Everytime I refused shed immediately text our parents complaining that I was misbehaving to get me in trouble

at the end of our trip my grandpa & I went to the store to buy snacks, candy, & food to bring back home. My sister stayed behind claiming she wasnt feeling well. Our mom had asked us to find a specific book & I managed to find it & buy it while with my grandpa. When we got back my sister quickly texted our mom in the GC claiming that “we” got the book, trying to take credit. She took the book from me, packed it in her luggage & took 95% of the candy saying she needed more bc she had to share with her bf & his family. She left only 1 pack of cookies for me/our family

Frustrated by this, I told her I didnt agree & I asked her to gimme the snacks & the book so I could put them in my luggage, wanting to personally give the book to our mom. My sister became agitated saying shed already packed it & would give it to me in the morning & stop making a big deal. I knew she was trying to distract me, hoping Id forget since we had to wake up early for our flight

The next morning I asked for the book again & predictably she said “Its already packed I’ll give it to you later” meaning when we got home. We argued,so I started unzipping her luggage to take it. She tried to push past me but I stood firm causing her to stumble back and yell at me. My grandpa intervened & I explained that she wasnt giving me the book I found. When he talked to her she insisted it was already packed, and he shrugged it off saying it was too late

I refused to drop the issue & said “Fine,you can go without me then” & went back to my room. Moments later she stormed in & slammed the book on my bed. So we left for the airport. Just 5 mins away my sister suddenly said, “I cant feel my hands” & started screaming & crying, seemingly having a panic attack. My grandpa immediately turned the car around & drove to the ER

We then arrived at the airport 3 hrs later with only an hour left before our flight forcing us to leave our checked luggage behind. We barely made the flight

Once we landed my sister immediately played the victim to our parents, who sided with her & got upset with me. She clung to my dad like a helpless child & he blamed me for our late arrival at the airport, nearly missing our flight, & told me Id have to pay for the luggage to be returned bc it was all my fault

139,1evsfi3,AITA for telling my wife she has to take care of her chores?,"My wife (29f) and I (30m) have been married for 3 years and things have for the most part been pretty great, we’ve had our arguments like any other couple but nothing serious.

3 months ago my wife told me she wants to dropout of her grad program and just go back to working. I was supportive and told her I’ll support whatever decision she makes. She did end up deciding to drop out and began applying for jobs. She has had a few interviews in the past few months but unfortunately nothing has really panned out. It’s not her fault, just a tough job market in our area. Over the past few weeks she’s started to slack on her household chores. For reference, I cook, do the landscaping, take out the trash, and we do laundry together. She handles everything else mopping,sweeping, dishes, and just overall upkeep of the houses cleanliness. 

We have a dog that sheds like crazy so sweeping/vacuuming is really important. Mid July I noticed that the floors hadn’t been vacuumed in a while so I took it upon myself to pull out the vacuum and just vacuum the house. She noticed and said she’s sorry she’s just been busy and she’ll get around to “deep cleaning the house” I told her it was no big deal.

The other day I walked into the house after work and noticed a horrible odor, I made a comment about it and said it’s possibly coming from the huge stack of dishes that need to be done. She said she’ll get to them eventually she’s just been really busy. So I ended up doing the dishes because the odor was in fact from there and I can’t stand bad odors. After I finished I looked at my wife and said “Could you possibly start contributing to the chores, you’ve been talking about deep cleaning for a while but haven’t really done anything other than lounge around” this really seemed to upset her, she stormed off into the guest bedroom and slammed the door shut and hasn’t talked to me since. 

I understand I may have come off as rude but it’s been frustrating considering she’s been at home doing nothing. So AITA?


Edit/info:
A lot of people have asked about the division of chores. It has always been like this. When we first got married my wife had a full time remote position. It was really an ideal job, it didn’t require much of her time and that’s why she was able to handle all the other household tasks while I was at work. When she began her grad program she went to class twice a week and I volunteered to her help her out but she said “I left streaks when I mop” so she wanted everything to stay the same. 

Also, I feel a need to defend the landscaping lol we live in FL on half an acre. Yes it’s not a lot of land but grass and weeds grow like crazy, so although it is not a daily chore, it is a weekly chore that takes me about 3-4 hours just depending. The heat is also not a great addition.

Finally, I feel like I may have posted this because I had a feeling it could be depression I just needed others to reiterate it. After reading the comments I think it’s time to have a discussion. I’ll try to find the best way to broach the subject, if anyone has any suggestions on how to proceed with that, it would be greatly appreciated.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-19,"AITA for telling my wife she has to take care of her chores?

141,1evs7r3,AITA: for asking why by boyfriend’s family doesn’t call me “mija” like they do the other girlfriends?,"I (23F, white) have been with my boyfriend (24M, Mexican) for nearly 9 years. We currently live together and are very open with both of our families about wanting to marry and have children in the near future. I do not speak fluent Spanish, but I try my best to build relationships with his non-English speaking family, which includes both of his parents. I have never been given a nickname (which I have come to realize that a nickname is given almost to every family member) or been called mija. This never really bothered me as I assumed they just didn’t because I am not a blood family member and have not shared a child with my bf yet (the other girlfriends all share a child with their respective partner). However, recently, one of his cousins and his new girlfriend moved into their (my bf’s parents) home. They quickly began calling her mija. This caused some sort of feelings (possibly jealousy, insecurity, or outcast maybe?) so I decided to bring it up to my bf. As soon as I mentioned that his family does not call me mija and I was wondering why. He quickly became angry and said it was a “respect thing.” I asked, “if it is a respect thing then why does everyone else get called it?” Like essentially, in my head, it was like he was saying they don’t respect anyone but me which is just plain nonsense. He then said that they do all respect each other, which made me feel like he disproved his own rebuttal. Anyways, we went in circles and he finally called his mom to ask (which I did not want him to do) and she said because she is “more comfortable” calling me by my name than by mija. It kind if hurt my feelings that a girl they barely know is being called “my daughter” but their potential daughter in law (they have no daughters btw) isn’t called that. I think it also hurts because I know it is said in an endearing way to her and everyone else. After he called his mom, he called me ungrateful and accused me of saying his parents/family didn’t respect me even though this is not what I meant at all and was just trying to express my worries. Like do they not like me enough to call me that? Is it because I am white? Is it truly out of respect? Should I have kept this to myself? Am I the asshole? 

TL;DR- my boyfriend’s family does not call me “mija” like they do all the other girlfriends. AITA for asking my bf why they don’t and feeling ~insecure~ about not having a nickname? 

EDIT: I would like to address some concerns that keep arising in the comments. 1) I have learned some Spanish, which is why I said I am not fluent instead of “I don’t know any.” I can handle general conversation topics and greet them in Spanish. When we play family games like loteria, I speak primarily in Spanish, even when calling out the cards. I practice Spanish when we go out to eat by trying to order our food. 2) Our relationship began when we were barely 15. This was not a “we are seriously committed and want to marry” relationship until we grew older together. When we made this decision is when I became serious about investing time into appreciating not just the language, but the history and religion of his heritage and culture. 3) My bf has never made me feel like an outcast for not knowing Spanish. Even when I confide in him for not picking it up as quickly as others may, he reassures me that it’s okay and that I’ll get there. So there is not a sense of not belonging that stems from him.

EDIT 2: Thank you all for your honest input. Much of the feedback has been focused around my lack of speaking fluent Spanish. I agree that this is a necessary skill I must acquire for the sake of our multi-generational connections, including his family and our future kids. I would also like to add that despite the language barrier, I know his family cares for me. Yes, as many of you have noted, this relationship would look a lot different if I shared their culture. When I confidently speak complex conversations with his family in the future, I am sure our relationship will blossom, but I love them just the same right now. 

Overall, I was having difficulty comprehending why I am known just by my first name, but that is their choice to make and I can either dwell on it or work on strengthening my bond with them. I will make more of an effort, not just through oral communication, but quality time with his mother through cooking lessons (thanks for the idea!). I will not force them to call me something and maybe it was a bit dramatic to bring this up as a concern rather than implementing some of these strategies first. This is also not a dealbreaker for my boyfriend and I (yes we also have things to continue working on) and as long as be is calling me “babe,” no other nicknames really matter.

I will make more of an effort, not just through oral communication, but quality time with his mother through cooking lessons (thanks for the idea!). I will not force them to call me something and maybe it was a bit dramatic to bring this up as a concern rather than implementing some of these strategies first. This is also not a dealbreaker for my boyfriend and I (yes we also have things to continue working on) and as long as be is calling me “babe,” no other nicknames really matter.

142,1evrzrc,WIBTA if I confront someone in my DND group chat for being rude.,"Hello! This is simple but I just need advice on how to approach this situation.
I am a DM and in my current campaign I only planned on having three of my friends but I was open to others joining. Well another person has joined and I was happy and added them to the group chat.

Here's when the thing happened. So basically (I don't really know this guy one of my friends introduced him to me for the campaign) he was spamming the group chat until like 8:50 pm image memes think Facebook memes there were 32 images in total and he got mad that no one responded 

I didn't care I like it when my players bond keep in mind I think he knows I'm the DM

Well I decided to text the group chat at 9:00 about something that happened to me in a game that was funny to me I specifically said 
-""hey guys ok it's late but blah blah *funny game screen shot*""

Now I understand if someone doesn't find a specific thing funny I just never flame them for it but this guy responds with

""It's too late for this. Your shenanigans are not welcome. Wait until 6:00 or 6:30 bro please. We're trying to go to bed""

Keep in mind he had sent 32 images in the group chat.

Now look I don't want to be a mean DM nor do I want to police the group chat however you can easily silence your phone or not look at the group chat.

I'm hoping tomorrow to pull my friend that knows this guy aside and explaining to him that I do not need any unnecessary drama over me sending a group chat message late and that the guy needs to respect me as his DM and someone he doesn't really know.

I really don't want to come off as rude or demanding but it's really grinding my gears on how none of us were rude to him about the images but he tells me this shit like I'm a toddler. I need to set those boundaries because while I want my players to have freedom I will not be flamed over a stupid text message by some guy who just joined the campaign. 

I know how I'm going to approach it I would just like some advice thank you.

143,1evrh6n,AITA for the way I introduced my boyfriend to a famous person?,"I’m (33M) on a fairly new relationship (4 months), and my boyfriend (29M) still hasn’t met many of my friends, and vice-versa. \[FYI: we’re both men, in case you haven’t noticed.\]

This Sunday one of my friends was celebrating his birthday. He’s an assisting director and one of his closest friends is a very well-known actress who was also at the party. We've met before and always had a good time.

So, while I was making the rounds and introducing my boyfriend to people he hadn’t met yet, I followed that basic introduction pattern \[i.e. “Jane, this is John, my boyfriend”; “John, this is Jane, (the birthday boy’s) friend”\].

When I got to this ‘famous’ person, however, I only introduced my boyfriend to her, because I thought it would be silly to go the other way around – he knew who she was after all. \[A hypothetical example even though the 'levels of fame' here are not comparable: it would be like saying ""Madonna, this is John, my boyfriend""; ""John, this is Madonna, (the birthday boy’s) friend”\].

Yet I could tell he was acting weird during the party, and when I got the chance to ask him if something was bothering him, he said he felt undermined by the way I conducted this interaction, as if he was less important. Honestly it wasn’t my intention, but I wonder if I could have acted like an asshole here.",Asshole,2024-08-19,"AITA for the way I introduced my boyfriend to a famous person?

To keep it short about a year ago my dad had an episode that revealed that he had diabetes type 2. Basically he was in bed for almost 2 weeks straight, going to the bathroom a lot , and his blood sugar was so high he legit forgot who me and my siblings were at his worst. 

  
Fast forward to today he has gotten better and they even told him he could switch to the pill. About 2 weeks ago he started to feel sluggish and in bed with no energy throughout the week. My mom started buying his stuff with electrolytes but when I came in I asked her if she had checked his blood sugar( I had come by to help cut the grass to help out.) She said he didnt want to do it and even got mad when she set up a doctors appointment for him. Hes always been the type that hates going and figures he can just sleep/walk stuff off. I slightly called him out then and told him he should get it checked he agreed and today a week later I find out he said he didnt check it because he was ""feeling better"".(hes still kinda weak and going to the bathroom a lot)

Today I called him out but really focused on you should check your blood sugar and while no one will call you out for not doing it I will at least say something. I then told him I cant be apart of it taking his help on things(we were supposed install new brakes on my car together) when hes not even helping himself. I just feel complicit if I just sit by while his health declines due to neglect. Hes not even taking his pills likes hes supposed to because they make him tired he says. My mom doesnt want to confront him because he gets angry and got angry when I did. But at the end I grabbed the brakes I brought over and  told I love him but I cant sit by while he does it. I always said if he has to hate me for calling him out it is what it is.

145,1evq51v,AITA: Guilt “Trip” - Attention-seeking neighbors ,"I’ll try to keep this brief. I am a single female, 29 and I live in an apartment. An older couple (50-60ish) lives upstairs with 2 dogs and they have made a point to talk with me whenever the chance arises. That’s fine. 

One day the woman knocks on my door, all beat up and bruised saying her dog drug her down the stairs. She asks me to walk her dog while she recovers. I agree.

She begins calling, texting, knocking more frequently asking for additional favors at a moments notice. I start feeling uncomfortable, like I am being taken advantage of.

I stop responding and attempt to keep passing conversations short to send the message that I would like to set some boundaries.

I do my best to avoid interacting with them. I’m walking to my apartment talking on the phone with a friend, when the man is walking his dogs and suddenly drops to his knees making a scene. To me, this appeared very intentional… there was no obvious reason why he “tripped”. In attempt to resist engaging, I give a “you okay?” And once he stands up I carry on.

Today I get a text from the woman calling me a “detached snot ball” and shaming me for not helping him. It honestly felt like some kind of trap.

If it was a genuine fall and he was actually hurt, of course I feel bad. But I can’t help but feel like they are trying to get my attention with these “accidents”.

Me and my husband both work for my family’s business and he works super late on sundays so i stay with my parents (they have a nursery guest room with everything we could need in it) that way im not stuck alone with my newborn for 12+ hours. so i can have time to eat,shower, or just sit down and relax.  my mom is naturally good with babies and she is so calm when my mom holds her to help me. we spend the night and my husband comes over to sleep when he gets off work and the next day we go home when he wakes up. we see my in laws any random day through the week usually for at least 2 hours a visit. 
obviously i know it’s not as long as staying the night with my parents and sisters but i wouldn’t feel comfortable staying the night and day at their house alone. my husband and i can tell it’s pissing my mil off, but i make all the plans with my side of the family and my husband never plans anything and i feel he’s expecting me to plan things for his side too. i don’t have much motivation to plan anything since anytime we do see his parents my husband goes off with his dad and my mil keeps the baby the whole time (the baby screams the entire time) and she doesn’t want to give her back, even when the baby is giving hunger queues she keeps her. i feel uncomfortable asking to see my own baby when we are around them because mil has made it clear she’s upset with me and doesn’t feel she gets to see the baby enough. 
it’s been causing a lot of fights between my husband and i , and i really don’t want to argue with him. he says he sees both sides but doesn’t think his mom has a right to be mad about anything? i think his mom being so upset about it is stressing him out.  i don’t feel like im keeping the baby from her, considering we see mil every week? i just don’t plan anything extra. but it’s honestly already not a good time for baby or me when we go over there every week. aita?

151,1evpn18,AITA for going behind my grandmothers back to get my mom’s ashes?,"
I'm a 15-year-old girl. My mom died when I was eight from a heart attack (though I was lied to about the cause). Both of my parents struggled with addiction, so I lived with my grandparents. They took custody of us after claiming my mom left us at dealers houses , which I do remember. I believed this until I spoke with my aunt, who said my mom missed her custody hearing due to a mix-up, not neglect. A month later, my mom died. I didn’t know about her death until years later when I saw a memorial video on YouTube. My grandmother and dad knew she had died but never told me.

I was also told my mom overdosed, but my aunt insists she was sober and provided autopsy reports I can access when I turn 18. Recently, I secretly met my mom’s family with my sisters and got small urns with her ashes. We lied to our grandparents, who are currently in Italy, about where we were going. Now, I feel immense guilt.

My grandmother has always cared for me, and I feel conflicted. My grandmother is genuinely one of my favorite people , without her I don’t know where I would be.I don’t know if I should tell her the truth, especially since she believes my mom’s family is unstable due to mental health and addiction issues. I’m also scared that if she finds out, she’ll stop my sister from seeing her boyfriend, who drove us to meet our aunt. Am I the asshole for wanting closure?

152,1evpibo,AITA For Telling A Friend To Get out of a bad relationship?,"So Nick (19M) and I (19F) have been loose friends with benefits for about two years. We were both very clear from the beginning that we have no romantic interest in each other and if someone else came along we’d easily resume a fully platonic friendship.

Nick started dating this girl Anna (19F)(bi-polar I think?) about eight months ago. I was really supportive of it. Two months into their relationship, Anna told Nick that she didn’t want us hanging out or talking. I'd never make a move on a partnered person (and also generally don’t believe in spouses telling one another who they can and can’t see), but Nick agreed with Anna and cut me off. I was a little sour but whatever. 

Six months later, Nick texts he had a dream about me in bed. I ask how Anna's doing. Nick calls and we catch up. He tells me that his relationship with Anna has turned increasingly toxic. I told Nick that was a messed up relationship. Nick agreed and asked if I wanted to hang out. We made plans to see each other.

I guess the night before Nick and I had plans, Nick told Anna he was going to see me and she flipped out, which instigated him breaking up with her. Nick said they were up all night arguing and it ended pretty poorly.

I tend to believe if a guy calls a girl 'crazy' her behavior usually spawns from his poor treatment beforehand, and I have no doubt in my mind that Nick disregarded some crucial aspects of the story when he told me. We hung out the next day as planned and after a few hours ended up hooking up. It just kind of happened.

My friend says I clearly broke them up and am an asshole, but I feel like I only played as big a role as each of them wanted me to.

154,1evpd6h,AITA for not watching Deadpool 3 with my boyfriend,"Edit 3: I feel like I need to add some clarification for the people saying I should just go and answer questions he has - I had to pause episode 1 of Loki last week to explain the “blue cube” to him, which is in plenty of movies he’s seen, in the first 2 minutes of the show. And then I had to hear him complain because he hasn’t seen infinity wars or endgame, but they’re kind of referenced in this too, he was like “see this is why i didn’t watch to watch this, I haven’t seen that part” even though I’ve tried to watch them many times and they’ve been out for years. I know how he is, I don’t “not like him” but I’d rather not stop every time something is spoiled or he has a question since I’d be watching it for the first time too. 



I can’t even believe this is a problem but my boyfriend randomly brought up going to see Deadpool 3 this week since it’s out of theatres after Wednesday.  He’s never seen 1 and 2 but I have. I basically said “sure we’d have to watch 1 and 2 this week” which he said he doesn’t want to. I have no desire to sit in a movie theatre with someone who has no idea what’s going on so I said I don’t want to go, which he’s annoyed about now. He said that he heard it’s a good movie and he doesn’t care that he doesn’t know what’s going on. I don’t want to have to answer questions and if anything comes up in the movie that relates to 1 or 2 I can’t even talk about it since he has no idea what’s going on at all. That doesn’t seem like a fun time and I don’t feel like going to a movie theatre when I could just watch it alone in bed, I’d basically be watching it alone anyway. It’s the same thing if someone wanted to read book 3 of a series without 1 and 2, that makes no sense to me if you have no idea what led up to that. I told him to go himself then, I don’t want to waste a trip to the movie theatre for this. 
He thinks I’m an asshole and it’s not normal to think this way and I just don’t even know why it’s an issue to begin with. I feel like it’s probably pretty common so I figured I’d see how Reddit felt. 

Edit: I feel like I need to clarify the fact the he wants to go because his friends keep telling him about it, not for me. I’ve been asking him to watch marvel movies with me for years, specifically the ones that already are out so he can catch up and he never does. It’s quite literally only because his friends keep mentioning it. 

Edit 2: based on the comments, it doesn’t really seem like 1 and 2 are necessary so I’ll just go see it with him. Also, love the “gatekeeping” comments. I haven’t seen this movie yet and I was waiting for him to catch up anyway (with 1 and 2 which obviously isn’t needed). I’ve been trying to get him into marvel for years.

Normally that won't throw me off, I find a lot of designers at thrifts & have been gifted designer items in the past. They were all huddled together around each pile of clothes & digging through talking about how much each item would be worth

These people were also taking items from children's hands. They were grabbing baby & toddler clothes & anything Levi or Columbia. They were discussing how much they planned to sell everything for

I didnt get pissed until I saw them yank a childrens dress from a toddler's hands cuz ""Oh my god I could get like $50 for this"". The kid started crying & ran to find their mom because she was upset. I ended up going to the volunteers who were navigating the event and told them about the group, and they kicked out the resellers, saying ""you can come back after a majority of the people leave & go through what is left"". They got all huffy & left, not before grabbing several pairs of shoes that were by the entrance of the place

They ended up posting on the Facebook group that had announced the event and were calling the church out for kicking them out. (I knew it was one of the people in the reselling posse because i checked the profile and recognized the person).

I replied I did not want her contacting me again for anything to do with her personal affairs. I have heard nothing since. The other employees and some of the people we know are upset with me for setting a limit on this woman in midst of her terrible loss. I should just stop being petty and forget the money. I should be more understanding. I should help her. They make me feel guilty for being happy to be rid of her. Am I the asshole here?",0.0,0.011282139457762241,0,1
158,1evp4mi,AITAH for “copying” my friend’s music taste?,"Hi. This might be a stupid post, but I feel really shitty right now.

So basically, I made friends with this one girl online who listened to a bunch of different bands and who I thought was really cool. We listened to primarily the same bands, yet I was getting out of a phase mostly and listening to the bands she was listening to, and when she started to mention other bands, I decided to take a listen to them, and I ended up really liking them. I love music a lot, so I always have a personal connection with it, and I connected with that music a lot more than any other. So, I also listened to them.

We were friends for a good few months. Recently, she started to listen to some other bands, and since I was jsut interested to see and was hoping to expand my taste. I started to play them, and I ended up really liking them (also, one of the bands my dad used to play in the car for me when I was a kid, and I even told my friend that!).

Today, though, I ended up getting two DMs from her two friends, one calling me a ""poser"" and another just calling me a ""loser"" and good luck for ""liking (genre of music) more than (friend)"" which I found really weird. I didn't find it a competition about who liked music more. I don't care about that. Yet, that jsut got on my nerves.

So, I sent the messages to my friend as asked her about it, and she was basically cheering on the one that called me a ""loser"". I first was like ""uh"" and didn't really speak to her. Literally a few minutes ago, she sent me a DM saying that two of the bands I was listening to, or ""getting into"", were ""hers"". She's done this before with two of my favorite bands, and I didn't really question it.

I feel really shitty since basically I was getting into every band she did, and in honesty, I just thought she was really cool and I looked up to her in that. Another reason is because this has happened before. I had a friend I knew since I was in elementary who was basically the first one to introduce me into the genre of music I listen to today. I got into it, started to go by that style, and I was pretty happy since I started to feel like myself. Yet, she also claimed that I copied her. I didn't really understand since she was more ""goth"" and I was more ""grunge"". She made some posts online about it directed towards me and also another one of how she didn't like the friends, which she deleted. I felt like I had to apologize a million times, yet I never felt truly forgiven. That friendship fell apart eventually after that.

So, because this has happened twice, I feel like I'm the asshole with this.

Secondly, they got in some kind of domestic dispute at 6 in the morning the other morning and were screaming at each other. At 6 in the god damn morning. (It didn’t sound like anything serious; just a couple loudly arguing). 
Lastly, the power went out in our building for a night the other night and it was deathly quiet. Then all you could hear was their bed squeaking. Like do what you want and everything, but really? Right after the power goes out and it’s literally silent in the whole building?

160,1evotqp,AITA for telling my coworker that she is horrible and will probably end up alone?,"I (32M) have worked with Emily (25F) for the past two years. If I’m being honest, me and Emily have not always had the best relationship because she has a problem with respecting boundaries and she consistently comes to me for life advice. 

For the last year, Emily has been dating Jon (30M). I’ve met Jon once before and he seems to be a very nice guy. Ever since they’ve been dating, Emily has consistently raved about Jon and how she feels this  is the best relationship she’s ever had.

She would always brag about the fact that he would take her on expensive vacations or shopping sprees , and even though they didn’t live together, he paid for her rent and most of her other bills. She was also always bragging about their sex life and how good it was. 

A couple of weeks ago Emily came to me at work almost hysterical. I asked her what was wrong and she told me that the day prior Jon had asked her to pick something up from his apartment and bring it to him at work.  She said that while she was at his house, she decided she wanted to start snooping through his stuff, and she found out that he had been taking Viagra.

Apparently, her finding out that he was on Viagra made her extremely insecure, and she was panicking.  I explained to her that there are a number reasons why he might be on it but the best thing for her to do would be to have a conversation with him about it. I was able to calm her down and she told me that she would talk to him.

Three weeks later, she came to me crying and hysterical. I  found out that she actually did not take my advice. Instead of talking to him about it she decided to talk to his mother, and when that didn’t get the results she wanted, she then called his sisters. And to make matters worse, apparently she had made a post on social media about him being on Viagra and accusing him of being gay and using her as a beard.

Needless to say that didn’t well for her, and she has been receiving a lot of backlash from his family and friends, as well as her family and friends.  Apparently, Jon had reached out to her and explained to her that he was on that medication due to an illness that he has and then he broke up with her. 

The whole time she was telling me this she kept making excuses for her actions and trying to blame Jon for the fact that she went to social media and that if he would’ve just told her in the very beginning, she wouldn’t of assumed he was gay.

I’ll admit hearing her say that really irritated me. And I ended up telling her that she was a horrible person for what she did and that she will probably end up being alone if she continues with this kind of behavior. 

She walked away, crying and telling me that I was an asshole and that I was too harsh.

163,1evo3bz,AITA for taking back a genshin account i gave to my ex-bestfriend,"Not quite sure how to start this, but basically for context me and my bestfriend at the time who I'll call Manny were both 12 or 13 have been besties since preschool, we had a falling out in second grade but rebuilt our friendship a year before this story took place. Before reconnecting with Manny, I was really interested in the game Genshin Impact and although having good characters my account was absolute dog shit. With that in mind I was already planning on getting a new account. I managed to get a new account a couple months after befriending Manny and still was fortunate enough to have my old one, I decided to give my old account to Manny so we could play together. 

Fast foward about 6 months and its halloween, me and Manny already planned to have matching costumes about a month ahead so we were both looking foward to it. That was until she cancelled a couple days before halloween saying she couldn't go anymore cause she was going to her dads to trick or treat with the kids in her dads neighborhood. Ngl I was pretty upset and probably acted like an asshole since during this arguement I was pushing her for answers and explanations that I thought I deserved to know at the time. After a while of back and forth we dropped the conversation and didnt speak much of it after like 2 days. 

Now I thought things were going to go back to normal after this small arguement we had espically since no hard words were exchanged or feelings hurt, I just thought of it as a small altercation we could forget about. I think she thought differently tho cause for the next couple weeks Manny began ghosting me and only texting me whenever she needed help with her genshin account. It was like I was there for her but she wasn't for me, I even got kicked out of her friendgroup that she introduced me too. This type of ghosting behaivor went on for a month and I was tired of it, seeing as she only reached to me about an account I gave to her this was when I decided to take it back. I admit it was very childish of me and I really only did it to be petty. My whole mindset towards this situation was ""if this bitch only wants to talk to me about an account I gave her I might as well take away that reason."" and just overall being sour about this. And so I did just that, I took the account.

Which by the way the server aspect is important too since I wanted an account in America since my other friends were beginning to play. But yeah, it was mainly because I just wanted to take it back, i felt like i had some sort of right too and that she didn't deserve it which is pretty shitty of me.

164,1evo183,AITA for telling my FIL the truth?,"I think this year has finally broke me after everything that has already happened and it's only August but I finally caved and told my ex FIL about the 12K credit card my husband racked up behind their back.

We have been separated/living separately for roughly 2 years but during our marriage, he left so many of the bills that were either his portion of the shared ones or that he was supposed to cover... completely unpaid. When I first moved out into my own apartment (as a single mom with no family) I was stressing to not only catch up on bills but also get my vehicle back. 

Back story about the car: I had no idea he hadn't paid for it in over 6 months so they repo'd it on Christmas Eve. (thanks guys) Part of his bills was both car payments. I got a low-cost car and he got a used truck he couldn't afford... he would also end up using my car for almost a full year leaving me/my young son without one because he decided to buy this truck that I told him would breakdown and we couldn't afford to fix. Which is what happened. His dad stepped in and bought him an older car so my son and would have a car again. Not only for emergencies but for groceries or to even just take him somewhere fun after I was done with work.

Well.....he didn't pay my car payment but he kept paying on his truck that was sitting idle the entire time.....while also racking up my CC behind my back that his parents helped us pay off along with all of his other debt which I was EXTREMELY grateful for but he made the whole deal behind my back and now had to pay them an amount we couldn't afford BUT it was better than paying interest. So I was beyond grateful his parents offered to help me when they didn't have to. My CC debt was just below (2K).

We are still married (only because I can't afford a divorce) and I am worried this credit will come back on me. 

He would never talk to me about finances, he worked 2 jobs and yet I never saw any extra income (so there is a huge part of me that thinks he purposely kept my car and cheated but I have no proof) but then again he didn't talk to me about much.

165,1evnx5j,AITA for telling off my dad when he didn't call my daughter,"So for some back story: my dad has a history of not being the greatest. He makes poor decisions, has no social skills and just generally causes problems. Recently his life choices have caused some issues financially, and contact has been almost non existent(it's mid August, I haven't heard from him since the end of June.). 
My daughters 6th birthday was yesterday, and my dad didn't call her, didn't acknowledge it at all. She is his only grandchild, and he's not getting any more. I don't care about a gift. I care that my six year old asked me when her papa was going to call and he never did. 
When I had a moment without my daughter today I called him and asked wtf he was doing that he couldn't take 5 minutes to call his granddaughter. He told me he just ""forgot to do it"". I told him this was the final straw. I had given him a lot of chances and he's managed to screw up and disappoint every time. 
He fired back and told me if I thought it was important than I should have called HIM and had him talk to her. I said it wasn't the point, I was mad he didn't take the effort to call her when he was off work and it was her birthday. I told him that as her grandparent he should want to be involved and I wasn't going to force her relationship with him if all he's going to do it let her down. I told him we would take a break from talking to him, and he can decide if he wants to be a grandparent or not, and hung up the phone. 
So am I the asshole for telling my dad off?


Edit for clarity: my kid asked me about him calling because she had just gotten off the phone with her other grandpa, and it was still only 8:30 in the morning. I told her I didn't know but I was sure he would call her. She didn't bring it back up the rest of the day.
Also for clarity my dad has backed out of things with her before, and left her disappointed on more than one occasion. 
Backed out of a fishing trip day of, leaving me to try and explain. Skipped her preschool graduation(doesn't sound that important but was actually a big deal due to my daughter starting school nonverbal). She was hospitalized at 2 and he didn't visit her at all.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-19,"AITA for telling off my dad when he didn't call my daughter So for some back story: my dad has a history of not being the greatest. He makes poor decisions, has no social skills and just generally causes problems. Recently his life choices have caused some issues financially, and contact has been almost non existent(it's mid August, I haven't heard from him since the end of June.). 
My daughters 6th birthday was yesterday, and my dad didn't call her, didn't acknowledge it at all. She is his only grandchild, and he's not getting any more. I don't care about a gift. I care that my six year old asked me when her papa was going to call and he never did. 
When I had a moment without my daughter today I called him and asked wtf he was doing that he couldn't take 5 minutes to call his granddaughter. He told me he just ""forgot to do it"". I told him this was the final straw. I had given him a lot of chances and he's managed to screw up and disappoint every time. 
He fired back and told me if I thought it was important than I should have called HIM and had him talk to her. I said it wasn't the point, I was mad he didn't take the effort to call her when he was off work and it was her birthday. I told him that as her grandparent he should want to be involved and I wasn't going to force her relationship with him if all he's going to do it let her down. I told him we would take a break from talking to him, and he can decide if he wants to be a grandparent or not, and hung up the phone. 
So am I the asshole for telling my dad off?

166,1evnwpk,AITA for having to ask my gf who she is talking about?,"Just recently, my girlfriend received news from her friends that one of her old managers who she considered a good friend passed away. She sent me the screenshot of her friend’s text that informed her of his death. In the screenshot though, there was no mention of her managers name. Only references to “him”. 

I asked her to clarify by name who it was that died and she was immediately upset at me, telling me I don’t ever pay attention and never know anything. It turns out though, that she forgot to capture his name in the screen shot and she even acknowledged this, but persisted that I should’ve known who she was talking about regardless, and grew even more angry when I didn’t apologize. 

Maybe it’s worth noting that of all her managers from her previous jobs, this one was by far her favorite. However, she has had other managers in the past that she liked, even if only a little. And I figured that even if it happened to be one of them, she would still be upset at the news. And so, to me at least, asking for clarification doesn’t mean I don’t pay attention. AITA?

TLDR: Gfs prior manager who was a friend to her passed away, gf sent me a screenshot to notify me that didn’t mention a name, I asked for clarification who it was talking about, gf is mad at me now saying I don’t listen.
