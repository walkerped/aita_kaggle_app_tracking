0,1eww3wj,WIBTA if I decide not to name my baby after my mum?,"TLDR at the bottom.

Myself and my husband have been trying for a baby for a few years, and I am finally pregnant. Both of our mums were single parents, and are both thrilled about a new grandchild.

My husband and I have been discussing names for a while now, and decided that while we don't want to use a family name as a first name, we would like to for a middle name. For a boy, it would be his uncle who was basically a father to him. For a girl, it would be a version of my mum's name.

Because of how involved our families have been in our journey, we've been open and honest about the middle names we liked. My mum was over the moon about it. She really has done everything she could for me, and she still continues to do everything possible to help us. But the problem I'm having is she's been making some really hateful comments and sharing horrible opinions about trans people and gender queer people. I've made it clear her ""jokes"" aren't funny but she will die on the hill of ""I am allowed my opinion"".

So WIBTA if I go back on what I said? As it was my name suggestion, my husband is on my side whatever I choose.

1,1ewisjy,AITA for not apologizing to my friend after she screamed at me and my kid at her wedding?,"Obligatory this is a throwaway

Two weeks ago, I (F29), Hubby (M31), and Son (M4) attended my BFF's (F28) wedding. It was a beautiful ceremony, and everything was going great, until BFF and her husband cut the cake. 

Important context, BFF did speak to me during her wedding planning about being unsure on whether or not to allow kids at her wedding. Her 2 sisters both have kids around son's age, and she sees him as her nephew, too. But, she wanted to be able to let loose and enjoy her wedding without worrying about any kids messing things up. I gave her my opinion, saying me and hubby allowed kids at our wedding and wouldn't have it any other way. The kids were still family and deserved to be included. After that, and speaking with her sisters, she and her husband OKed kids for the wedding. 

Now, the ceremony went swimmingly. BFF's nieces sat with me, hubby, and son, as her sisters were in the bridal party. I brought quiet activities to keep them entertained and everybody behaved. I even cried from how lovely it was.

When we got to the reception, nieces were returned to their parents, so it was now just me, Hubby, and Son. Dinner went fine, and then the couple took to the dance floor for their first dance. Afterwards, everybody was welcomed to the floor to dance for a bit before cake cutting. At this point, the kids were running around and playing with each other and it was a fairly secure space and I knew almost everybody there, so I felt comfortable with Son playing with the other kids while Hubby and I had fun dancing. Important to mention now, Hubby offered to DD so I could enjoy myself, so I had had a couple glasses of wine at this point. BFF had also been drinking and celebrating.

BFF and her husband go to do cake cutting, and hubby and I are a little slow getting there, so there was a crowd blocking our view. Suddenly, I hear BFF SCREAM Son's name. Hubby and I push forward to see what's wrong. I see my son with frosting around his mouth and on his fingers. The cake had a small chunk taken out of it. I try to apologize, but BFF turns around and yells, ""This is YOUR FAULT. Your son RUINED my cake. He's only here because YOU told me it would be worth it to include the kids!"" I yelled back, telling her that it was just an accident and the rest of the cake was still edible. That this was her nephew she was screaming about. She told me I was no friend of hers and he wasn't her nephew, in front of everyone. She told me to leave or she'd call security. Son and I were crying atp and the 3 of us left. 

One of the bride's sisters reached out to me after and apologized for her sister's reaction, but said I needed to apologize. I think sorries are out the window now after her outburst. I told her sister so and said I expect an apology first before I'd say anything to her. Not only did she blow up at me in front of everyone, but at my son. I'm humiliated but even more angry on his behalf. So, AITA if I refuse to apologize first?

2,1exb3j1,AITA not allowing my MIL to stay with us,"I'll try to keep this brief, but it's a complicated situation.

First, my MIL (63) is terrible with money. At 55, she received a £50,000 pension lump sum and decided to buy a house. She lived there until early 2021, when she put it on the market. She confided in me that she was selling because she had accumulated too much debt from renovating the house and was struggling financially. The house was a new build in the UK, meaning it was like a blank canvas.

She then insisted I keep this secret from my husband, her son. However, my husband already suspected she was in debt due to her behavior. A few days after our conversation, I told him because I didn't want to keep secrets. This confirmed his concerns.

My husband calmly approached her about her finances, offering to help if she was open about her situation so we could create a debt management plan. She refused, sold the house at a significant loss, and lost the entire lump sum.

Since 2021, she has been ""sofa surfing""—staying with various people until she outstays her welcome. 

- Aug 2021 - May 2022: She stayed with her ex-boss and his wife, who eventually asked her to leave. They haven't spoken since, suggesting a fallout.
- May 2022 - Dec 2022: She stayed with a friend, but they no longer speak.
- Jan 2023 - Nov 2023: She lived with a work colleague but is no longer in contact with them either.
- Dec 2023 - present: She's staying with my husband's best friend's mother.

During these stays, the most she's paid for rent and bills is around £400-£600 per month, despite earning about £3,500 monthly.

We've tried multiple times since 2021 to discuss her financial situation and offer help in getting her own place, but she has consistently declined, insisting on doing things ""her way."" We stopped trying around December 2023.

Her current host told her in June that she must leave by the first week of September. Now she's asking us to let her stay in our spare room. We asked about her long-term plan, whether she's cleared her debts, and how long she plans to stay. We set a maximum stay of six weeks.

She admitted she has no long-term plan and said six weeks is too short to find a place that allows dogs. We offered to take care of her dog until she finds suitable housing.

My husband fully agrees with this approach. We've tried continuously to help her before, but she's always declined.

With all that said… Let’s get into it.

My gf and I have a great relationship most of the time but our cat has just had kittens. Her mum and dad are crazy over cats and think they’re experts.

But, it’s not just her mother coming in either. Her little brother is also getting a kitten and comes in a lot to see it. I don’t get along with any of the brothers because they like to stir the pot and they’ve found a new target (me because we’ve been raised very differently).

8,1exafpx,AITA for telling my mom about my grandmother’s secret affair with different men behind my grandfather?,"
So I 14(f) is really close with my mother 38(f) . Growing up she would always say how her family favoured her sister , my aunt 36(f) more than my mother and her brother, my uncle 29(m). She would say how she had to give up mostly everything to my aunt the “golden child” as she pulled of many tantrums and be a “good sister” by just doing as she asked this led to my aunt being entitled. After having me my mom discovered how my father turned abusive towards her because of her in laws . When my mom told my grandmother about this and asking if she could file for divorce as my mom being only 24 at the time it would have been easy . My grandmother not only refused but host a family gathering telling how bad of a wife and mother my mom was to think about divorce as in our family women must suffer. After the gathering my mom was forced to stay in the relationship and five years later my brother was born and now in the starting of September 2023 my mom gave birth to 2 babies both girls and my father with the help of therapy overtime changed and is now a loving dad and husband. Well my dad being a total gentleman pissed of my “gold child” aunt because her marriage and life has suffering and my mom has it “easy”. So she starts a new blown drama on how my mom did not raise me well and blah blah basically some bs . Me and mom did not mind it and fully ignored it . During this as my grandparents started visiting more often my grandmother gave me her phone look and see through some problems. While fixing her phone I stumbled across a message from a person a near relative of my grandfather 61(m) looked so suspicious so being the trouble maker teen I am went to her chats and what I found there was just plain disgust and disbelief. My grandmother 57(f) and a long distance relative of my grandfather were SEXTING and send nudes and to remind the man my grandmother has an affair with is only 39 years old. I was just in shock by what I just saw and sat there for a couple of minutes before giving back the phone to grandmother. Just to be clear my grandfather is not abusive or toxic  towards my grandmother rather than the opposite loving and caring and Worship her as if she is some kind of a goddess. Well back to the story before my grandmother left I kinda hinted about me knowing her affair but she didn’t get it fully after they left I started making a plan to dig more into this relationship before telling my mom. So after a few a days of collecting evidence I approached my mom and told her about not only one but two affairs one with the relative and one with a mutual friend of both my grandparents the dude will be around 59 I guess . It was the same with him SEXTING and sending nudes.my mom was traumatised and since this was sensitive topic to about to my grandmother we decided to as a cousin of my mother also a therapist to ask and tell my grandmother to stop this dirty relationship and we also asked him to specifically say I was the one who found it . Well after he confronted my grandmother it isn’t really could she being the Karen witch denied and started guilt tripping me saying I am trying to tear upart the family but only my mom her cousin and I know about unless she wants to expose herself . Well the last few days she has been texting and calling me non stop saying or basically threatening me that if I dare to tell anyone about this I will  be tearing upart the happy families….. now I am confused so AITA for exposing my grandmother to my mom? I need y’all help and support as I need suggestions on what to do now?
",TL;DR,2024-08-20,"AITA for telling my mom about my grandmother’s secret affair with different men behind my grandfather? 
So I 14(f) is really close with my mother 38(f) . Growing up she would always say how her family favoured her sister , my aunt 36(f) more than my mother and her brother, my uncle 29(m). She would say how she had to give up mostly everything to my aunt the “golden child” as she pulled of many tantrums and be a “good sister” by just doing as she asked this led to my aunt being entitled. After having me my mom discovered how my father turned abusive towards her because of her in laws . When my mom told my grandmother about this and asking if she could file for divorce as my mom being only 24 at the time it would have been easy . My grandmother not only refused but host a family gathering telling how bad of a wife and mother my mom was to think about divorce as in our family women must suffer. After the gathering my mom was forced to stay in the relationship and five years later my brother was born and now in the starting of September 2023 my mom gave birth to 2 babies both girls and my father with the help of therapy overtime changed and is now a loving dad and husband. Well my dad being a total gentleman pissed of my “gold child” aunt because her marriage and life has suffering and my mom has it “easy”. So she starts a new blown drama on how my mom did not raise me well and blah blah basically some bs . Me and mom did not mind it and fully ignored it . During this as my grandparents started visiting more often my grandmother gave me her phone look and see through some problems.

11,1ex9xsy,"WIBTA if I quit my high-pay, high stress job?","I have a senior job at a well-known US tech company. It sounds cool, pays well (mid six figures), but it’s stressful, with long hours and late nights. The CEO is difficult and infantile, and honestly, I don’t care about the product area.

In my previous career, I worked on start-ups and freelance projects. The pay was maybe 1/3rd of my current, but I loved the work. We rented a nice house in a city we liked with great schools.  But about six years ago, my wife became obsessed with owning a home. She grew up with a lot of moving trauma and insecurity because her family never owned a house, and for her, owning meant stability.

We agreed that if my start-up didn’t take off in six months, I’d get a “real job” so we could buy a house.  This meant moving to another expensive city that had more jobs with higher pay. I got a job in Silicon Valley, and we eventually bought a house in a nice suburban neighborhood.  This was about 5 years ago.

At first, she was happy, but after a while, she became unhappy again. She now complains about where we live, saying it’s boring, that she can’t make friends (she didn’t have many before either), and that maintaining a house is stressful. She talks about how much easier it would be to rent a small apartment downtown.  (note that we have maids and such, so my wife does not do any household chores, so this is not about housework).

She’s also unhappy with my workload, saying I work too much and have no life, which is partly true. While we still travel and enjoy some things together, I admit I work too much due to the instability in my industry.

Lately, she’s accused me of being selfish and gaslighting her, claiming I would rather pursue my high-status job at the expense of the life she loved in our previous city. In reality, she was the one who wanted this change. It feels like she’s rewritten the past.

So, here’s my question: WIBTA if I just quit? We could sell the house, move back, and return to a lower-income but comfortable life. Selling the house would leave us with a good chunk of cash, although not enough to buy a place where we used to live. I’m exhausted by the arguments and think, maybe this would teach her a lesson. She’s unhappy now anyway, and at least I’d be happier without this job. Is there really a downside for me?  Is that an a-hole move?

14,1ex950j,"AITA for breaking up with my ex boyfriend, or just needing space? Strap in, this’ll be a long one.","
So, a little context: I (22F) and he (23M) have dated on and off for, give or take, six years. We met in high school, went out for a little while, and then he left me for another girl, which I eventually forgave. I guess I was seeking validation and ended up being somewhat foolish.

We talked a bit more in high school (not dating at that point, but he was inching closer to wanting to date again). The next day, he had a new girlfriend, with whom he dated for about a year and a half. At that time, I was in a relationship with another guy. Eventually, he ended his relationship with that girlfriend, and I ended mine with my guy.

Fast forward a few months: we started talking again, but as friends, deciding we were best suited to each other as friends only. About six months later, he asked if we could try again. I said yes, thinking we were a little more grown up now and it might work out. About a month into the relationship, everything was going well until one day he decided to break up with me out of nowhere. He later told me his reasoning was, he wasn’t used to someone being kind to him or treating him properly in a relationship.

We didn’t talk for about two weeks, and then he randomly called me, telling me he got a new girlfriend and talked about her throughout the call. They stayed together for about two years. During that time, we remained friends, and I even became friends with his girlfriend, to the point where she would invite me over. We all ended up being good friends, and by then, I had zero romantic interest in him and just saw him as one of my best friends. I decided to put our history behind us and move on.

A few days before they broke up, he started making inappropriate advances toward me (trying to touch me, and so on). I told him that was unacceptable and reminded him of the wonderful girlfriend he wanted to have a future with. It seemed he understood. A few days later, they broke up, and he began leaning on me for advice and comfort. A few months later, we decided to have a purely sexual relationship, as we were both single and thought we could handle that with no strings attached—at least I could.

A few months later, he admitted to having feelings for me and said he loved me. I told him that I didn’t feel the same way and had buried those feelings a long time ago. He kept pushing, insisting that I would change my mind in the future, which was definitely not going to happen. I simply didn’t see a future with him. His constant pushing made me very irritated and felt disrespectful. I told him we should stop sleeping together and go back to just being friends, as it was confusing him and complicating our friendship, and frankly, making me uncomfortable.

Before I continue, I should mention that I’m a huge people pleaser, so I tend to say yes to avoid upsetting others and to make them feel better, even at my own expense. I’d rather suffer in silence than see others unhappy because of my actions. Fast forward to a work party of his: he invited me, and we were both drinking. He eventually asked me to be his girlfriend, and I responded, “How about we talk about this when we are both sober?” He took it hurtfully, saying things like, “Oh, you don’t love me or care about me. Am I so bad?” So, in that moment, I felt bad and said yes to avoid hurting his feelings.

The few weeks after that night were fine, and I was actually staying with him during that time. He has a lot of issues with emotional dependency and has many highs and lows that leave me confused. One day he would love-bomb me with nice texts and in-person affection, and the next, he’d be silent, annoyed, and distant. If I tried to talk to him, he’d give very short, rude responses and act like I was the last person he wanted around. The next day, he’d switch back to love-bombing. This inconsistency left me walking on eggshells, not knowing which version of him I’d get.

I always encouraged him to communicate and keep me in the loop about his feelings so I could understand and help. But it felt like he expected me to read his mind, which I couldn’t do. He tended to project his emotions onto me, so if he was having a bad day, he made sure I had one too. It was exhausting, and I was constantly regulating his emotions while dealing with my own mental struggles. We’d had conversations about effective communication, but every time I tried to express my feelings, he either didn’t care or changed the subject. For example, if I didn’t give him constant attention or if I didn’t see him for more than two days, he’d get very upset, call in sick to work, and neglect to take care of himself until I stepped in to make him feel better. This behavior was very draining for me.

I felt like it went in one ear and out the other. In the moment, he’d say, “I’m going to work on it, I want to be better for you and treat you better,” but nothing would change. For me, actions speak louder than words, so I stopped talking about anything and didn’t share what was going on with me or how I was feeling.

I decided to leave and go back to my place to get some space and recharge. I needed that time alone because at work, I deal with clients and have a tough home life where my family constantly yells at me and makes me feel horrible. I needed to retreat to my room and drown out all the noise without someone breathing down my neck and without having to tend to others’ needs for a little while. I expressed this to him multiple times, explaining how I rely on alone time to stay sane. He seemed to understand at the time. I told him I wouldn’t be texting or seeing him as much. After just two days, he was upset with me for not communicating enough. I went to see him in person to talk, and he was very aggressive and angry. I was at a loss for words, not knowing what to say.

He said things like, “This made me question if you really love me or care about me. It makes me feel like I don’t even have a girlfriend.” I told him I did love and care about him, but I needed space. During the argument, he mentioned that he felt I hesitated in saying yes to being his girlfriend and that I actually wanted to say no. I admitted that was true and I agreed just to avoid upsetting him. I then asked, “If you knew I wanted to say no, why did you keep pushing?” He responded, “It’s a guy thing, we’re always going to chase.” I don’t think someone who truly cares would put someone they care about in that position, knowing how the other person would react.

It went on for a little while longer, though we eventually “made up.” After that, I was considering telling him how I really felt and breaking up with him because he was stressing me out even more and wasn’t good for my mental health. He always said he could be my safe space, but it never felt that way—just hostile.

Whenever I brought up that we needed to talk, he’d start love-bombing me, saying how much he loved me and how beautiful I am. I felt he was trying to keep me in the relationship with these comments. One night, I decided enough was enough. I told him everything he was doing that hurt me, why I had been distant, and that I needed space to work on things. He seemed to understand and agreed on many of the points I brought up.

Two days later, he called me, very upset, saying he didn’t want to talk to me at all because the thought of me made him sad and upset. He expressed insecurities about me and felt I hated him or was always annoyed with him, which wasn’t true. He compared himself to me, saying he was envious and felt it was a competition, which I didn’t understand since I’m not materialistic and care more about people than things.

I went to talk to him in person because I still wanted to help. He felt better when I talked to him. The next day, he started love-bombing me again over text, sending long messages that felt disrespectful of the space I’d asked for. I let him do his thing until the end of the day, when I responded that I needed space and hoped he could understand. He said he understood and still loved me.

Days went by, and he kept love-bombing me, so I gave short responses as I still needed time to myself. I believe he thought if he kept sending nice messages, I’d come back, but it only pushed me away more. The next day, he asked me to pick up all my stuff and return his. When I asked if he was angry, he said yes and sent long paragraphs about how I was pushing him away, not sharing my feelings, and how he felt I didn’t want to be around. It seemed he didn’t respect the space I needed and was now angry at me for actually taking it.

That’s where I am now. This is a very peculiar situation, and I honestly have no idea what to do. I haven’t responded yet but plan to see him later with all his stuff, hoping to calm the situation a bit. 
I just feel so used, and disrespected, and naive, and feel like I’m just being taken advantage of in every way.

 Any advice from anyone here? I would love to hear a different perspective as my mind is just so foggy from all of this. Thanks! ",TL;DR,2024-08-20,"AITA for breaking up with my ex boyfriend, or just needing space? Strap in, this’ll be a long one. 
So, a little context: I (22F) and he (23M) have dated on and off for, give or take, six years. We met in high school, went out for a little while, and then he left me for another girl, which I eventually forgave. I guess I was seeking validation and ended up being somewhat foolish.

We talked a bit more in high school (not dating at that point, but he was inching closer to wanting to date again). The next day, he had a new girlfriend, with whom he dated for about a year and a half. At that time, I was in a relationship with another guy. Eventually, he ended his relationship with that girlfriend, and I ended mine with my guy.

Fast forward a few months: we started talking again, but as friends, deciding we were best suited to each other as friends only. About six months later, he asked if we could try again. I said yes, thinking we were a little more grown up now and it might work out. About a month into the relationship, everything was going well until one day he decided to break up with me out of nowhere. He later told me his reasoning was, he wasn’t used to someone being kind to him or treating him properly in a relationship.

We didn’t talk for about two weeks, and then he randomly called me, telling me he got a new girlfriend and talked about her throughout the call. They stayed together for about two years. During that time, we remained friends, and I even became friends with his girlfriend, to the point where she would invite me over. We all ended up being good friends, and by then, I had zero romantic interest in him and just saw him as one of my best friends. I decided to put our history behind us and move on.

A few days before they broke up, he started making inappropriate advances toward me (trying to touch me, and so on). I told him that was unacceptable and reminded him of the wonderful girlfriend he wanted to have a future with. It seemed he understood. A few days later, they broke up, and he began leaning on me for advice and comfort. A few months later, we decided to have a purely sexual relationship, as we were both single and thought we could handle that with no strings attached—at least I could.

A few months later, he admitted to having feelings for me and said he loved me. I told him that I didn’t feel the same way and had buried those feelings a long time ago. He kept pushing, insisting that I would change my mind in the future, which was definitely not going to happen. I simply didn’t see a future with him. His constant pushing made me very irritated and felt disrespectful. I told him we should stop sleeping together and go back to just being friends, as it was confusing him and complicating our friendship, and frankly, making me uncomfortable.

Before I continue, I should mention that I’m a huge people pleaser, so I tend to say yes to avoid upsetting others and to make them feel better, even at my own expense. I’d rather suffer in silence than see others unhappy because of my actions. Fast forward to a work party of his: he invited me, and we were both drinking. He eventually asked me to be his girlfriend, and I responded, “How about we talk about this when we are both sober?” He took it hurtfully, saying things like, “Oh, you don’t love me or care about me. Am I so bad?” So, in that moment, I felt bad and said yes to avoid hurting his feelings.

The few weeks after that night were fine, and I was actually staying with him during that time. He has a lot of issues with emotional dependency and has many highs and lows that leave me confused. One day he would love-bomb me with nice texts and in-person affection, and the next, he’d be silent, annoyed, and distant. If I tried to talk to him, he’d give very short, rude responses and act like I was the last person he wanted around. The next day, he’d switch back to love-bombing. This inconsistency left me walking on eggshells, not knowing which version of him I’d get.

I always encouraged him to communicate and keep me in the loop about his feelings so I could understand and help. But it felt like he expected me to read his mind, which I couldn’t do. He tended to project his emotions onto me, so if he was having a bad day, he made sure I had one too. It was exhausting, and I was constantly regulating his emotions while dealing with my own mental struggles. We’d had conversations about effective communication, but every time I tried to express my feelings, he either didn’t care or changed the subject. For example, if I didn’t give him constant attention or if I didn’t see him for more than two days, he’d get very upset, call in sick to work, and neglect to take care of himself until I stepped in to make him feel better. This behavior was very draining for me.

I felt like it went in one ear and out the other. In the moment, he’d say, “I’m going to work on it, I want to be better for you and treat you better,” but nothing would change. For me, actions speak louder than words, so I stopped talking about anything and didn’t share what was going on with me or how I was feeling.

I decided to leave and go back to my place to get some space and recharge. I needed that time alone because at work, I deal with clients and have a tough home life where my family constantly yells at me and makes me feel horrible. I needed to retreat to my room and drown out all the noise without someone breathing down my neck and without having to tend to others’ needs for a little while. I expressed this to him multiple times, explaining how I rely on alone time to stay sane. He seemed to understand at the time. I told him I wouldn’t be texting or seeing him as much. After just two days, he was upset with me for not communicating enough. I went to see him in person to talk, and he was very aggressive and angry. I was at a loss for words, not knowing what to say.

He said things like, “This made me question if you really love me or care about me. It makes me feel like I don’t even have a girlfriend.” I told him I did love and care about him, but I needed space. During the argument, he mentioned that he felt I hesitated in saying yes to being his girlfriend and that I actually wanted to say no. I admitted that was true and I agreed just to avoid upsetting him. I then asked, “If you knew I wanted to say no, why did you keep pushing?” He responded, “It’s a guy thing, we’re always going to chase.” I don’t think someone who truly cares would put someone they care about in that position, knowing how the other person would react.

It went on for a little while longer, though we eventually “made up.” After that, I was considering telling him how I really felt and breaking up with him because he was stressing me out even more and wasn’t good for my mental health. He always said he could be my safe space, but it never felt that way—just hostile.

Whenever I brought up that we needed to talk, he’d start love-bombing me, saying how much he loved me and how beautiful I am. I felt he was trying to keep me in the relationship with these comments. One night, I decided enough was enough. I told him everything he was doing that hurt me, why I had been distant, and that I needed space to work on things. He seemed to understand and agreed on many of the points I brought up.

Two days later, he called me, very upset, saying he didn’t want to talk to me at all because the thought of me made him sad and upset.

15,1ex90ab,"AITA for calling my boyfriends dogs ""stupid fucks""?","Yesterday, I (26F) had an argument with my boyfriend (29M) via txt about cleaning. I thought I was expressing my frustrations without scolding, but he felt differently. I live at his apartment, he likes reminding me it's his place during arguments. This frustration stems from him moving things around, like weights from the garage to the living room, which adds unnecessary work for me. We both have ADHD, complicating our efforts to keep things tidy.

He has two big dogs that shed a lot, and I’m the only one who does deep cleaning in his one-bedroom apartment. I also take care of his dogs while he’s at work. This is not an issue if he doesn’t add too much to my workload. However, he often fails to tidy up after himself, which I’ve addressed multiple times. Yesterday, while trying to vent, I called the dogs “stupid fucks” in frustration after they pulled on the leash during a walk.

I care for his dogs daily, pet/play least two hours w each. I lack a bond with his dogs but we're all chill. I didn’t expect calling his dogs names would upset him so much. When he came home, he focused on how overwhelmed he felt and claimed I called the dogs names to hurt him. His reaction wasn’t new; he tends to lash out when angry, a recurring issue in our relationship over the past two years.

Despite my apologies, he dismissed them and said they didn’t matter. He suggested I get up earlier to clean more and complain less, which hurt because I’m severely depressed and managing daily tasks is a struggle. He implied my depression is a privilege since I don’t work or pay bills, not acknowledging that I don’t have a job due to visa issues. We were supposed to marry in January, but he procrastinated, and now we’re waiting for October.

He also suggested exercise as a solution to my depression, which felt dismissive. Telling me to go on runs seemed like “just exercise and you’ll be fine.” Finally, he told me to “SSHHT” while I was crying and talking to him. I told him this would be the last time I asked him not to teat me like that. He doubled down by yelling at me to go to the bedroom and making gestures like I was a dog.

I’ve expressed feeling that he treats the dogs better than me, which he dismisses by saying dogs don’t give him trouble. This frustrates me as it seems he doesn’t understand why I’m hurt. He said calling the dogs names was a big issue, despite my respectful care for them.

I don’t appreciate being responsible for cleaning up and he prefers if I don’t clean because I complain, but this would mean living in filth.

I’ve apologized multiple times but it doesn’t matter. I feels like he’s emotionally punishing me by delaying resolution. This seems abusive, especially with our differing attachment styles. My response was to leave until he was ready to talk, but he called me immature and manipulative. He claims to understand my feelings but his actions suggest otherwise.

17,1ex8zgp,AITA for not returning my friend’s jacket after he disrespected me?,"I'm a 28-year-old woman, and my friend Jeff, who is 37 male, was introduced to me by another friend I met at a party. Although we were on good terms, it was primarily because I was avoiding the fact that he was trying to sleep with me. On multiple occasions, he tried to get me high, likely hoping it would make me more relaxed and receptive to his advances, but it never worked. He never directly said it, but I’m confident those were his intentions. I kept him around because I wanted friends, and he kept me around thinking he might eventually succeed.

One day, Jeff joined me and my brother at the mall. We decided to have dinner at 7 PM, even though I had a date scheduled for 8 PM. I mentioned my date and that we needed to hurry, but Jeff started lecturing me about how making the guy wait at the restaurant was inappropriate and that I should let him know. Whether he was right or wrong, it wasn’t his place to say. I got the sense that he was jealous because he asked to see a picture of the guy and then started making fun of his appearance.

The next day, I was invited to a BBQ at Jeff’s brother’s house. While I was out picking up some items for the BBQ, Jeff called and told me he’d be at my house in 8 minutes and would only wait for 5 minutes before leaving if I wasn’t ready. His tone irritated me, but I told him I needed 10 minutes. He repeated that he would leave if I took more than 5 minutes, so I told him it was fine, and that he could leave, even before he arrived, because I didn’t appreciate the disrespectful way he spoke to me. He then said, ""I’m not like the stupid guy who waited in the restaurant for an hour. I’m not going to wait more than 5 minutes."" It felt like he was trying to assert his dominance, but I told him to go ahead and leave, as I no longer felt like going, especially since I’d just gotten a speeding ticket with 2 points on my license while rushing home.

Before this argument, Jeff had forgotten his jacket with me. I immediately called him to come pick it up, but he said it was fine and that he’d get it later, which I then forgot about. A week after our argument, Jeff reached out asking if I still had his jacket, and I confirmed that I did. He contacted me again, saying he wanted to pick it up the next day. I told him I’d be busy and suggested we find a time that worked for both of us, but he insisted on picking it up the next day or said he’d ask my brother or our mutual friend to get it for him. I told him he could do whatever he wanted, but that I wasn’t going to bend to his demands. He then said he would tell everyone I stole his jacket. I didn’t steal it; I simply didn’t want to return it on his terms, as if he were the center of the universe.

Jeff then spoke to my brother and our mutual friend, claiming that he left on the day of the BBQ because I had been late to a group outing before, which supposedly created tension in the group—none of which was true! The only person I was late meeting was my date that night. Ironically, Jeff had been late when we were supposed to go to the beach the previous Sunday, but I didn’t make a fuss about it.

After I explained the situation to my brother, he laughed, but when I told my friend, she insisted I bring her the jacket so she could give it to Jeff. I was annoyed because I had clearly explained my feelings, and when she continued to insist, I told her to stay out of it. I didn’t want to fight with her over something so trivial.

As of now, I still haven’t given Jeff his jacket back because I want to teach him a lesson in respecting people.

19,1ex8ryk,AITA for complaining that by brother in law does not buy food for me?,"
My husband and I see my brother-in-law (BIL) and his family (his new partner and 2 girls from 2 previous relationships) approximately once every 2-3 months for the last 2 years (before that we lived very far away). We don’t have any kids, and each family earns almost the same. 

Sometimes we meet at their home, and we always bring something (food or dessert, and also a gift for their daughters).

When we go to restaurants, my husband has paid for the meal for all 6 of us on 5 occasions. Once, all the family put their orders in a McDonald vending machine for my husband to pay for everything by credit card, and I considered that very rude…My BIL paid only once, but it was a very awkward situation and in the end he did it reluctantly. When we go out and it is only a drink, it is my husband again who always pays. 

Every time we see the girls, we bring something for them (cologne, make-up kits, books, plushies, art crafts… ). Also, we have taken the girls to musicals twice, with dinner and snacks included.

Finally, this week we have seen each other twice since we are all on vacation. We went to a restaurant one day and my BIL ordered everything he wanted and my husband paid for everything. My BIL in the way out said that he could have paid, as he doesn’t care about money. 

The next day, we met in the afternoon and my BIL mentioned that we should go to a rather expensive restaurant, and we told him that it would be no problem if he paid for it, since we had already used up our vacation budget. Upon hearing this, they started to suggest having dinner at home or going out for a drink.

But, since the girls were in the mood to party, we ended up at a Mexican place. My BIL suggested ordering something to share. While he was ordering, my husband was in the bathroom and I was talking to the girls. Finally, some nachos arrived, for the 6 of us to share. Then, 4 tacos arrived, which he put aside on his side of the table, and gave one to his partner, one to each girl, and one for himself. He hadn't ordered anything for us.

My husband and I started to feel uncomfortable. As we were leaving, I said that I had eaten a lot (the irony in my tone was noticeable) and my BIL’s partner took it the wrong way. My husband interceded saying that i had eaten a lot throughout the day, and that was what I meant. Seeing that the situation was not going to improve, we each went home.

Now, I'm not sure how I should have handled that situation. My husband is kind of angry at me because my attitude could harm his relationship with his brother. for me it was a huge disrespect that he didn't order food for us after we had almost always paid and behaved very well with his daughters on every occasion.

I told him that if he wants, I will ask his brother for forgiveness. Even so, I believe that the relationship is not healthy and I can no longer look the other way.

Once, all the family put their orders in a McDonald vending machine for my husband to pay for everything by credit card, and I considered that very rude…My BIL paid only once, but it was a very awkward situation and in the end he did it reluctantly. When we go out and it is only a drink, it is my husband again who always pays. 

Every time we see the girls, we bring something for them (cologne, make-up kits, books, plushies, art crafts… ). Also, we have taken the girls to musicals twice, with dinner and snacks included.

Finally, this week we have seen each other twice since we are all on vacation. We went to a restaurant one day and my BIL ordered everything he wanted and my husband paid for everything. My BIL in the way out said that he could have paid, as he doesn’t care about money. 

The next day, we met in the afternoon and my BIL mentioned that we should go to a rather expensive restaurant, and we told him that it would be no problem if he paid for it, since we had already used up our vacation budget. Upon hearing this, they started to suggest having dinner at home or going out for a drink.

But, since the girls were in the mood to party, we ended up at a Mexican place. My BIL suggested ordering something to share. While he was ordering, my husband was in the bathroom and I was talking to the girls. Finally, some nachos arrived, for the 6 of us to share. Then, 4 tacos arrived, which he put aside on his side of the table, and gave one to his partner, one to each girl, and one for himself. He hadn't ordered anything for us.

My husband and I started to feel uncomfortable. As we were leaving, I said that I had eaten a lot (the irony in my tone was noticeable) and my BIL’s partner took it the wrong way. My husband interceded saying that i had eaten a lot throughout the day, and that was what I meant. Seeing that the situation was not going to improve, we each went home.

Now, I'm not sure how I should have handled that situation. My husband is kind of angry at me because my attitude could harm his relationship with his brother. for me it was a huge disrespect that he didn't order food for us after we had almost always paid and behaved very well with his daughters on every occasion.

I told him that if he wants, I will ask his brother for forgiveness. Even so, I believe that the relationship is not healthy and I can no longer look the other way.

Okay, so I'm (24F), working two jobs to save up and move out, and currently living with my mom (46F). She's always been a bit...overbearing, but things escalated way too far. 

A few days ago, she decided to do a ""deep clean"" of my room. I asked her to please not touch my stuff because she's, let's just say, not the most careful person. Can you believe she actually got mad at me for that? She started yelling about how I should clean better, but my room was actually tidy. She just has this weird obsession with everything being her way.

Anyway, she kicked me and my siblings out while she ""cleaned."" Can you imagine? When we came back, she casually drops this bomb that she threw away a bunch of my clothes because they were ""moldy."" They weren't. They were perfectly fine! And she didn't even ask me first.

I was in shock. I mean, who does that? I looked through the mess she left and realized she'd thrown away like 90% of my clothes, including stuff I need for work. Then she has the nerve to tell me to pick five outfits and throw the rest away! I told her no way, because she destroyed most of my stuff and I need clothes for work. She threatened to throw away the rest if I didn't do it myself.
The worst part? She threw everything she tossed into the trash compactor. Like, completely destroyed. So I told her if she did, I'd make her pay me back for everything she threw away. It's like, $600-$700 worth of clothes. Now she's mad at me for wanting her to pay for the stuff she ruined. AITAH?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-20,"AITAH for making my mom pay for my clothes?

A few days ago, Friend 1, who we’ll call Anna, called me around 10 o’clock asking if I could talk. She explains to me that, that day at 12h, Friend 2, who we’ll call Paola, was acting “touchy” around her such as putting her arm around her waist, being visibly close and shit. Anna explains to me that she felt uncomfortable and that she doesn’t see Paola that way at all.
I give her a bit of advise and Anna tells me that she’ll send a message to Paola like I suggested and hung up.

That is when call number 2 happened. Seconds after hanging up, Friend 3, who we’ll call Pat, calls me.
She tells me she “has some tea” and that Anna and Paola might be secretly dating. Clueless, I tell her that Anna just called me to explain the situation and that she felt uncomfortable around Paola and wasn’t acting as if she was hiding a relationship or something. Pat asks again and I tell her again, although I specify that them being together could be a possibility, that it was highly unlikely.

I did think it was weird since Pat and Anna are best friends and wondered why she would prefer asking me for advise rather than Pat. But I ignored my gut feeling.

Then I receive a message from Paola asking to talk. I talk to her and she tells me she thinks she’s gay and has a crush on Anna. She then really underlines that since I’m the only gay person in the group that wasn’t involved that I was just the right person to talk to. In the end, I tell her to go talk to Anna about it and she hangs up.

Paola calls me and tells me Anna and her are together. I can’t help but feel like something is off. She explains that they just talked and decided on the call to be together and stuff and I said congratulations, feeling a little weird, and asked her if I was really the first person she told. She said yes and asked me to tell Pat about it for her since she just couldn’t. I hang up and call Pat.

I immediately knew something was wrong when I heard Pat’s “yes”. Because it wasn’t Pat’s voice. It was Anna’s.
So I ask :..Anna..?

And that’s when they burst out laughing . All three of them. They were together the whole time.
They started explaining that this was a prank and that they weren’t planning on it going this far but since I believed them so easily, they just kept going. After hearing them say those words, I hung up, turned off my phone and started to cry when I realised that they just decided to bother me, making me believe that I was useful in any way, that I was part of our group for once in my fucking life instead of invisible, just for shits and giggles cause they were bored.  It seemed so obvious when I looked back at it, that they were messing with me since I’m an easy target. Stupid gullible me who believe everything they said.

Plans changed when we found out Hannah's bf's friends also wanted to go, but did not have a ride. My boyfriend was hesitant to take them, but agreed when they offered gas money. We split the people up, and two of his friends rode with me and my boyfriend in my Prius. It took us about 15-20 minutes to get to the pick up spot, and 30 minutes to get to the amusement park. At the park, I was even able to give one of the friends a cheaper ticket offer because of my season pass benefits. It was another 30 minutes back and also 15-20 minutes back home. Off the top of my head, I told them it was $10 each. They then got upset and tried being super specific about the pricing (they looked up my car model and tried calculating the cost of the trip online). In the end, they only paid me $10 dollars in total. They told me if I was too broke to pay for my gas, I should get a job (they both don't have cars or jobs). I feel kind of awful because I would have compromised with a cheaper price (I also did the math after they paid me, and the trip would have came to about $15 dollars in total).

32,1ex5yvy,AITA for ditching my friends on a hike,"I went on a roadtrip with some friends and planned the entire thing myself. I gave them the ability to give feedback, but got very little. There were a few things that I really wanted to do and the rest was pretty flexible. One thing I REALLY wanted to do was a sunrise hike at a spot near our camp. You need to take a boat to get there and everyone online said to take the earliest one to make it onto the boat (it gets busy) and for the best experience. 

I struggled to get two of the people to get up and ready on time most days (yes, they could put an alarm on but chose not to). They ruined a few plans and it was frustrating, but again, I was pretty flexible. 

The night before the hike I told everyone that this hike at sunrise is something that I really wanted to do and would do whether they came or not. I told them the latest i would leave camp and that if they weren’t ready by then, I would leave. That morning the two of them were still sleeping. To be nice, I woke the two up with a 5 min warning. They then got up slowly but took long to get ready. 10 mins later (I waited an extra 5 minutes) I decided to leave them. At that point they were up but not ready. I told them i was leaving and left with the others that were ready. 

When we got to the boat, a line was already forming. 20 minutes later, the others show up. At this time, the line has gotten really long and we are near the front. The two then choose to cut the line (which makes it so two people that got there before them cant make it onto the boat) to join us. At this point im absolutely fuming but Im trying to just keep it together. 

We get off the boat on the other side and start our hike. I have long legs and can be a pretty fast walker. Going into this trip we knew that could be an issue as one of the girls (one of the late ones) struggles to keep up. She is slower and loves to stop to take pictures a little too much. She always gets upset at me and the others and tells us to walk slower (which is hard to change my pace for her constantly). We started the trip saying that we all walk at different speeds and that we will meet back up at points if we get separated. 

We start our hike and not 5 mins in, she stops to “readjust the stuff in her backpack” we stop for a few minutes and shes still not done. Im close to losing it, so i walk ahead a bit. Some of the others that were with me join. We then stop again to see if they can catch up, but at this point I am not happy and i tell the others that I need some time to hike by myself and walk off. They all understand and one comes with me because they are also not thrilled. 

We then have an amazing hike where we are able to do everything we wanted. When heading back, the trail is packed but we don’t find them. 
Apparently they couldn’t do the whole hike because of one of the girls and turned around.

33,1ex5ljv,"AITA for telling my friend that she should reconsider her career options
","LThe school district I live in is facing a teacher shortage. My friend Cynthia (25f) decided to go back to school to get certified as a special ed teacher because she said it will be a guarantee hire. Previously, she had retail and commission jobs and hadn’t worked with kids except a stint volunteering at a library in high school.

I was skeptical because I have a younger sister, Bryce, who is autistic and Cynthia is always annoyed whenever she hangs out with us. Bryce is high functioning, is in mainstream classes and has an IEP. But she also has a few niche interests that she has almost encyclopedic knowledge on. 

One of which is Harry Potter. Specifically, there’s a character who is coded as autistic in the movies. It was never confirmed by anyone except the actor who plays him that way. 

Last month, I look her and our brother to Comic Con. Bryce went as her comfort character and stayed in character, talking to the other con goers about her props and riffing off their cosplays. For example, asking an Elsa cosplayer about the trolls and if there were other magical creatures in Arendale.  

Over the weekend, I was at a party and showing some friends the pictures and video I got from the event. I was showing some video of Bryce chatting with a guy dressed as Deadpool. 

Cynthia saw it and asked why we let Bryce go to Comic Con in that outfit and why doesn’t she get into something “age appropriate” (she is 16) and isn’t she too old for Harry Potter, even going so far as to say we baby her.

First off, we don’t. We indulge in her interests but we do the same with everyone in our family. Besides, she can handle herself in public. 

I told Cynthia off and that if that’s how she acts with my autistic sister, then maybe she should consider a different field of work. Because she was Bryce’s teacher, our mom would have gone straight to the school district and ask she be assigned to someone else.  

Cynthia got defensive and said that she is only doing what’s best for the students and that the real world won’t coddle them that way before she left. Some of our friends think I was being too harsh on Cynthia while a couple others, including a friend whose brother has Downs, noted that she always acts a little weird around kids with disabilities and that she’s in for a wake up call since she’s only doing this to get a guarantee paycheck and benefits.

34,1ex5d1r,AITA for screaming at my mom and lashing out because she refuses to stop ranting to me about her marriage?,"My (20F) parents (55M and 55F) have been going through a rough patch in their marriage for some time now. It’s been almost a year since my grandfather passed away which has led my dad to spend more and more time with my grandma. He has also been through stress at work and usually decides to spend his day silently doing work or playing squash. My mom and dad have been arguing almost everyday because she feels neglected and wants him to go back to his lively self.

In the past year, I have been subjected to various conversations about their marriage and cracks in their relationship in general. My dad tries to convince me that he doesn’t have time to spend with us because he’s busy (this upsets me equally if not more than my mom because i’m very very close to both of them) and my mom has a long monologue about my dad and how he has no time for her, thinks she is boring and would rather spend all his time with my grandma.

I have heard both of their statements and tried to maintain an empathetic bond with both of them throughout. Both by lending an ear as well as trying to offer them advice.

Today, I told my mom how done I am with hearing the same story again and again, how I don’t have the emotional capacity anymore or handle any of this. I told her how i’m not involved in the situation and don’t want to talk about it anymore because it’s getting too much for me. My mom told me that i’m trying to escape the situation, she said “you’re a copy of your dad and grandpa.” My mom disliked my grandfather because he was always cruel towards her and said some nasty things to her. This hurt me very much because I have done nothing but tried to offer them some respite from their lives and listening and listening and listening to the same goddamn thing everyday. I slammed the door and screamed at her that I don't care about her marriage and don't give a shit about the situation anymore. 

AITA for screaming at her? 

TLDR: Lashed out at my mother after an argument about my parents marriage and her feelings of neglect.

I’m sorry if this is hard to read, english is not my first language.

Update: I wrote to my mom about what happened and even apologised for lashing out because speaking calmly is clearly not my family’s strongest suit. She has chosen to not reply to me at all and hasn’t even acknowledged what I wrote. I’m giving up and will no longer try to initiate conversation or apologise.

35,1ex5b11,AITA excluding a friend from my other friend group?,"Throwaway for privacy.

I (23F) have always been very quiet. I'm quite introverted. Big social situations stress me out as much as I want to partake in them. As a result, I never had many friends in highschool. All my friends have always had more friends than me and a big friend group is something I always wish I had.

I have 3 friends who I met in highschool and we all stay in touch and make plans still - Maya, Laura and Casey. They're the only friendship group I'm a part of whereas I know those guys are part of multiple bigger ones. They're really cool friends, very kind and very outgoing. They're living the highschool experience I wanted now. They have a busy social life all the time. Their phones never stop going off, they go on holidays with friends, host dinner parties at their flats etc.

I met a colleague at work (Chris, 26) who shares my hobby - running. He has a lot of friends who run and he invited me to join them one time after work and we all hit it off. I'm a part of their groupchat and we regularly run together. I will go with them all sometimes or just with whoever is free. It's exactly the experience I wanted so badly in highschool but could never bring myself to have. 

A few weeks ago, my highschool friendship group broached the idea of going hiking. I told them about how I couldn't go because I'd already planned to run that day with one of mine/Chris's friends. Casey asked if she could join because she runs too so I brought her along and they all got on really well. But I would find she always talked over me and would talk louder and cut me off and it took me back to how I felt in highschool, pushed aside for my louder more outgoing friends. So I made a mental note not to invite her next time. 

Casey kept asking me after that day about when I would see the running guys again. I'll admit, I lied and said I wasn't sure and it was more of a spontaneous meet up but she kept persisting. Telling her that was stressing me out so I confided in Laura about it. I guess I should have known that she would tell Casey because she did and now Casey refuses to talk to me because she thinks I'm ashamed of her.

She ended up talking to their mutual friend while also telling my brother that he did something wrong when he said that. She said that he “made her feel like a kid” and made her feel dumb. She ends up telling my brother they should stop whatever they’re doing as it’s “for the best” and ends up going back to her ex boyfriend saying she loves him still and always on the phone with him.

She even told my brother that she still loves her ex so she couldn’t get into a relationship with him until she was completely out of love with her ex. 
They stop talking for a month and somehow they’re texting and calling until 3am every night. My brother, at this point is always telling me about her actions and sometimes even complaining that she can’t make up her mind and giving him “mixed signals” when she clearly stated that she:
1 still loves her ex
2 doesn’t want to date until a few years from now
Yesterday I called my brother dumb because he’s planning to drive 5 hours to go on a date with her in the following weeks. He got mad at me for that because he thinks i’m in the wrong, but I’ve heard about everything she has said to him.

42,1ex4kjz,AITA for keeping an old ex as a friend?,"

Hi!

Long story short, when I was 18 I had my first girlfriend (both girls). 
We were best friends for years and dated for about 5 months.
I don't really consider that relationship as serious since we never kissed or told ""i love you"". 
I know it sounds weird, but at that time of my life I was really depressed and immature and she was the first person to say something nice to me. I wasn't physically attracted to her, but at that time I thought that I wasn't able to choose people from their appearance since I was the most ugly person on earth. So I was really confused. I thought I was in love but then I realized in therapy that I was in that relationship just because it was comforting my insecurities.  

When we broke up, we talked after two years for the first time and both agreed that we destroyed a great friendship in vain. So we talked about being friends again. We both clarified that we wanted to be friends several time through the years.  (I don't feel like that was a relationship since we didn't even kiss, hold hands or even tell each other ILY). 
I just wanted to be friends again, she was really important to me, again, as a friend.

I was in a serious relationship at the time we talked again, my partner knew everything about it and was even happy with us talking again as friends. 
Just to add, in those two years I started therapy and I wasn't the same person I was before. 

Now a few years later, I am in a new relationship and my current partner doesn't like the idea of me and this ""ex"" being friends. We got into a discussion about it and now I am not sure how to feel. 
I love this person but I don't like the idea of choosing between them, I just don't get it. I told her everything that happened, my mental problems at that time and how that relationship was.

I don't feel like choosing one or another, I find it unnecessary. I feel like it's even unfair, that I can't keep the friendship just because we ""dated"" years ago. 

Please tell me if I'm wrong, I want to do things right for all of us. Any advice will be appreciated also. Thanks for reading:)",Not the A-hole,2024-08-20,"AITA for keeping an old ex as a friend?

43,1ex4gzx,AITA for complaining about my neighbors children?,"I will make this as short as I can. I (25F) live with my roommate, Jenny (24F) and we moved to the bottom unit of a duplex home. When we moved in there was nobody staying in the upstairs unit. About 5 months after we moved in, our landlord rented the upstairs unit to a couple with 3 children (9M, 12F and 13M). 

My roommate and I work full time and also go to school. Needless to say, we were already apprehensive about a family with young children living upstairs but obviously there was nothing we could do. We noticed rather quickly that the family is very closed off and the only one who speaks to us is the mom, who is very nice for the most part. We thought it may not be so bad after all. 

Over time the children started being children of course and have been running up and down the halls and screaming as they’re playing,for hours on end. Not only this but we also have a shared backyard that they have completely over took with all their toys and balls just scattered around the yard never to be cleaned up. 

The last straw was when we went outside to see the backyard covered in baby things (cribs, play structures, toys etc…) just scattered around covering the entire yard. To make matters worse, we saw they had placed a baby gate to cover out stair case leading to the yard. The mom explained this was to keep her children away from our unit, I was immediately ticked off as to me her children are old enough to understand not to come downstairs to our unit as that is no longer part of the shared backyard. Then I found out all the baby stuff is things she bought to open a daycare and will be storing them there in the meantime. 

I will be honest, I don’t mind children, but I will not sacrifice my own personal confort for someone else’s children. I don’t want to constantly complain about the noise, I just want them to be mindful without me asking. Well I reached out to my landlord who is trying to get me to be understanding of their situation as they are “nice” and “kind”. Well to be honest when I moved houses the main thing I did not want is to deal with any children. I don’t want to have to be understanding towards children I don’t even want to be around. I just want to live about my life like an adult. So I have been complaining about this to my landlord, because the times I have asked the family to be quiet, they act shocked and don’t know what “noises we are talking about”.

44,1ex480e,AITA for asking my wife to speak English when having family dinner,"My wife is from Belarus and her primary language is Russian/Belarusian. When we first met she had very broken English but could understand everything I said. I decided to start learning basic Russian phrases right away to speak with her and because I was excited for the opportunity to learn her language. It was a love at first site kinda deal and 9 years later we’re 6 years into marriage and 3 kids deep. She now can speak perfect English.

Since having kids I’ve been fully on board and supportive of them learning and speaking Russian. As one should be. I think it’s amazing, and I try my best to learn with them and even encourage opportunities for us to engage in very basic conversations. I’ve been a sole provider for 6+ years now so my wife spends the bulk of her day with our kids speaking Russian…our oldest is 6 and the only one old enough to be in school at the moment.

My issue is when we do get to spend time together it is often our time to converse as a family. Even though my kids understand and speak Russian they primarily only speak English…even to my wife who is speaking Russian to them 99% of the time. When we’re having dinner for example, everyone is speaking English except for my wife. So I have very little understanding of what she’s saying which often includes directions/guidance or things parents typically discuss together either with their kids or as a couple. Say she wants one of the kids to do something…she speaks in Russian and then my kids ask me if they can do the opposite without me knowing what their mother said. When my wife loses her cool and starts yelling at them in Russian, I have no idea what’s being said or how I can support/redirect or possibly provide a different perspective to my wife. Often if I’m verbally disciplining or providing guidance to our kiddos she’ll quickly pop in the room with her 2 cents…which I don’t have that same opportunity to do with her when she’s talking to our kids in Russian.

This topic has caused a lot of negative experiences within our family and I’ve suggested we speak English when having dinner and especially when we’re talking to our kids together as parents. She refuses to do it and makes comparisons to other couples who speak a foreign language in their household and that it’s “never” a problem for them. AITA?

Edit: My wife has known English her whole life. English is a 3rd language in Belarus. Russian, Belarusian, and English. It is taught in school from age 4 to college.

45,1ex3qmk,AITA if i talk to my roommates?,"i currently live in a house with 4 other people. i am not a very confrontational person. these girls are nice but we are not super close friends or anything, so it feels awkward to bring this stuff up sometimes. i have two points of concern that have been bothering me thus far.

1. there are 5 of us there but only 4 on the lease (ig the lease can only legally have 4 but we have a 5th person and the landlord knows this). with the house, we got 3 parking passes and 1 visitor pass. myself and two other girls are on the lease and have passes, and the girl who is not on the lease has the visitor pass. (important to note was she asked/preferred to be the one off of the lease, it wasn't decided at random.) we have two reserved parking spots, and the rest is street parking in the neighborhood.

the roommate with the visitor pass CONSISTENTLY parks in one of the two spots. it feels silly, but i feel like if we r gonna have four people and two spots, the one with the visitor pass should not get one. the street parking is pretty available and also close.

1. there are 5 of us there but only 4 on the lease (ig the lease can only legally have 4 but we have a 5th person and the landlord knows this). with the house, we got 3 parking passes and 1 visitor pass. myself and two other girls are on the lease and have passes, and the girl who is not on the lease has the visitor pass.

47,1ex3e7d,AITA My (26F) boyfriend (22M) will go on vacation with his gay friend ,"BEFORE YOU ALL COME AT ME PLEASE READ FIRST!!! 
     My boyfriend has recently started hanging out with a guy who after a few days told him that he was gay. My boyfriend already kinda knew it so it wasn't a big surprise. He didn't really care anyways.  That day he came to me and told me that ""I think 'X' might flirt with me or try to make a move while on vacation"" because he saw some ""signs"" (idk). They still hadn't bought the tickets though so I just told him ""don't go if you think that there's this possibility"". 
       Now here's where I'm uncomfortable. I really don't give a flying fck if it's a man or a woman. But I DO care that my boyfriend still ended up buying the tickets (aka making the trip official) with someone that HE (I never said anything about his friend. I didn't mind) thought was being/gonna be inappropriate. I know that my boyfriend would never do anything with a man because he is 100% straight so i don't worry of him cheating. 
      But let me tell you a few details about his friend. He is in an open relationship with his boyfriend. They both like doing threesomes with married man, so they don't really care if someone is in a relationship to respect it. And that's why i now don't want him to go. I feel disrespected if my bf goes when he knows there's a big possibility (his words not mine) that his friend is gonna find an opportunity while he's there and flirt/make a move. It's all about respect. And then I asked him ""what are you gonna do is he actually does flirt or make a move?"" And he said ""just say no and continue with the trip"" AND. I. FLIPPED. Please DO correct me if I'm wrong but if I was in his shoes I wouldn't continue the trip like nothing happened. I would avoid that person until the last day because it would be disrespectful to my boyfriend to continue and hang out with him. I don't care if he's a man and that my boyfriend would never go with him. He is still SOMEONE that's probably gonna flirt with him while knowing he is in a relationship. And yes I know nothing happened. Yet. 

EDIT: Stop saying that my boyfriend is gay or might be one because he wants to go on this trip besides the signs he's seen. The reason he still wants to go is because he's afraid his friend might think he's homophobic if he cancels plans now that he knows he is gay. But still, if I was in my bfs shoes I would make sure that my friend would 100% not try to make a move on me while we are there and then book the tickets, out of respect to my boyfriend and to myself

I’m Gen X mom is a Boomer. We have a rocky relationship but as a person in therapy I’m trying hard to mend it. She’s been a typical Boomer(not all Boomers neglected their kids she did). I’m the oldest of 5 (10 yrs older than the next sibling) I wasn’t parentified but she was a better parent to my brothers. My sister did not get very good treatment from her either. I have physical health issues that she ignored. She’s told me when she was postpartum that she could’ve gone to college and been something if it weren’t for me. I once had to move back after I was downsized. My brother who’s never left home was there and I would give her my entire unemployment benefits for the household. I wasn’t allowed to use the tv, cook, or wash my clothes there. My brother never lost his job but she said her baby didn’t have to give her money to be there because he was struggling. I didn’t stay long.
Here’s where I may be TAH. 
She was in a bad car wreck. Since the accident she’s had a serious cognitive decline. I live far away now and the last time I came home her house looked like a hoarder starter kit. She rents and has a new landlord (SLUMLORD) There’s mold and mildew everywhere. I told her I would move back and buy a home there so she could have a safe place to live. I work away from home 200+ days a year so the house would be essentially hers. BUT she could not hoard, I refuse to come home every 4 months to a disgusting house. She needs to throw away all the things that were molded and mildewed. When I told her my 38 year old brother can’t live there, she lost it! She told me I didn’t have any rite to tell her how to live and that she never wanted to speak to me again. She got in my face and doesn’t want anything to do with me again! Her cellphone has been on my plan since I moved in 2019. 2 days ago the phone bill was due. She has a phone, home internet, and a tablet on my plan. I’m paying $200+ for her services. I paid the bill, and had all of her services terminated. My golden child brother called and yelled that the internet was out and mom’s phone wasn’t working. I told him that I had terminated the services. He berated me and called me an AH. 
She called all my other siblings and told them I hate her and cut her phone off to get back at her, luckily they all told her they didn’t believe that but are all telling me I should’ve at least given them a warning.

We told both our parents around week 6-7 and they are over the moon (this is the first grandchild on my side, the first biological grandchild for her dad (Her mom died, FIL remarried and we currently have 4 step neices/nephews with another 2 coming before us). At this point in time, the people closest to us already know so we don't care too much if people let it slip to their close friends.

My parents were ok with that as long as they could tell the aunts and uncles they have close relationships with (which we were ok with). My FIL was struggling with waiting. He would call/talk with us every week or so to tell us how it was killing him to not share the news. We told him that we know it sucks to wait for 2 months since they knew but we were adamant to tell him no social media.

They basically want me to apologize for my behavior and my actions but I feel like if I do I won't get one back thus repeating my doormat cycle. So am I the asshole for wanting my apology first? ",,0.939629316329956,1,0

 My son and I were planning on hitting Monaco this year but we switched to Italy because of their request. I asked my wife about it, and she said she was ok with it. 

 Last weekend my wife came up to me and said she didn't want us to go anymore. She said that we could just go to Italy next summer as a faaaamilyyy.

I told her that wasn't going to happen, since I that means I had to cancel flights,  cancel hotels, and sell our tickets for an event that's literally in less than two weeks. I'm sure I'll be able to cancel the flight, but the hotel and tickets I'm not too sure of. Didn't even bother to check since we're still fucking going.

56,1ex201i,AITA For Refusing to Co-sign for an Auto Loan for my Older Brother ,"I (38 F) have a (45 M) brother named Jack who asked me to co-sign an auto loan.  

Some background: Jack is absolutely terrible with money, he’s currently on his 3rd marriage and has two kids: (M-10 from 1st Wife) and (F-7 from 2nd Wife) Jack has always been kind of lost per say, and he has always quit anything that is to hard for him our entire life: Boy Scouts, Sports, College, Marriages, and Jobs. His ability to get and keep a job is difficult for him because of his attitude and he’s always thinks he’s the smartest guy there.  Despite all this, I do love him dearly.  Back in February he told me and our parents that he was laid off from his oil field job, but we all know that is utter bullshit and he quit.  His wife has a good job but it’s not enough to keep them afloat forever, he is currently working, but it’s not great money and of course he has back child support on child #1 to get caught up on.   

He called me not long ago and let me know that his older truck is having a lot of problems and it’s becoming costly to keep fixing it and he and his wife plan on getting rid of it and getting something gently preowned. They do have another working vehicle. He asked me if needed, if I’d co-sign for the loan. I told him, I wasn’t comfortable doing that because it’ll impact my credit and probably end up being my problem eventually.  He got upset, and said he needs my help and he promised he’ll make the payments and it’ll be ok.  I told him no again and he got all pissy and we ended the conversation.  

I’m absolutely torn here.  I’m married and we are child free by choice, I’ve always been career driven and I’m very established in my field and I just finished my PhD.  Since I was young I’ve worked very hard to build my credit and keep it clean, we have no debt at this time nor want any.  I know it’s a matter of time before we’d end up having to make the payments which would probably be huge since his credit is so shitty and probably nothing for a down payment.  I’ve done a lot for him and his kids to ensure they don’t go without, I’m not asking for a parade or anything in my honor, but I feel like I have to draw the line somewhere.

58,1ex1p99,AITAH for leaving my friends to sleep in the station.,"Hi everyone first time poster long time reader. I just wanted to know if I am the asshole in this situation. All names have been changed.

 I (30f) have a small group of friends since the age of 17  we get along well.  Their is Katie 29 f, Dan 30 m and kirsty 29 f all are unemployed and expect myself , Jo 30m,  jack 30 m and Sophie 29 f to pay for them every time we go out. 

Katie also has adopted an akita with aggressive tendencys. I have met the dog and each time the dog was aggressive and growling  the dog has previously bitten twice. Katie refuses to put ""her baby"" in a separate room because ""it's his house"" .The dog has to come everywhere with us.

Dan lost his job due to having a lot of time off.

Kirsty is unemployed and refuses to go anywhere unless anyone else is driving/paying etc. 

The last time we planned a meal  with some other friends. When the bill came round  we all rounded up and left a tip. Kirsty felt sick and went home before paying . Katie went to the toilet and said that the tip everyone left covers her meal  and that she ""will just buy someone a drink"" Katie then said she couldn't afford it and against better judgement me, sophie jack and joe split katie and kirstys bill.

Dan then left us to try to chat up girls and kept downing a shot whenever he got rejected. By the end of the night Dan had been kicked out as he was really drunk. He insisted I drive him home as I was parked in the car park. His reason was I only had 2 drinks and if he threw up in my car it was better then a fine for vomiting in a taxi. I am against drink driving and I refused and made my own way home via a taxi. The next morning I woke up to missed calls and messages of how Dan had vomited in a taxi and it had cost £80 fine  plus fair and it was my fault for leaving him eaven though he was with katie. 

As a group we planned to attended a gig and needed to book hotels and go on a train ride Jack and joe shared and so did Sophie and partner. 

Katie suggested we all book a dog friendly hotel wich we did. We got to the hotel  before Dan and katie. We then receive a group message asking us to meet outside. Their was Dan and Katie with the Dog.Dan and Katie said they couldn't afford a hotel room and they were hoping they could sneak into mine  with the dog. katie would need the bed and they had brought me a sleeping bag to use.

This is where I may be the AH
At this point i had had enough and refused wich caused an argument leeding to Katie having a panic attack and Dan screaming at me how they couldn't afford it and I should do this for them as Katie is ill and cant be without  the dog (it Is not a service animal). Dan expected me to pay for a room for them and the dog I had distressed katie so much. I then refused and said if the dog bites me I will press charges.

My mom died when I was 8 so it was always dad's details only that were given for this stuff. The reason this is now a big deal is because my dad got married 10 months ago and my dad got the confirmation email but his wife didn't. They asked me why and I said because I only gave dad's email. They wanted to know why I didn't put both and I said it was for the parents and dad's my parent. That he has been my only parent since I was 8.

3 person house share. One has a cat. All it does is sleep, but is super needy and whiny when the owner is away. It’s also advancing in years so does need keeping an eye on apart from needing some generic cat attention. 
Myself and the other housemate aren’t here very often due to work and social commitments and although the other housemate is happy to check in on the cat when possible, I have asked that the cat be taken out of the house and to stay with a friend/cattery so it can receive more of the care and attention it needs. She was planning to get it taken to a friends house after I first raised the issue but has now decided to buy some automatic water and feeder gadgets and is now saying the cat will be staying at home. 
I really don’t want the responsibility of dealing with it, especially if something were to happen to it while she’s away, and I feel this is something neither of the housemates staying should have to deal with. If we wanted that responsibility, we’d have pets of our own. It’s a shared house, not a shared cat. If the owner isn’t here for an extended period, then neither should the cat. We’re not a super close household, and if the shoe was on the other foot, I wouldn’t dream of leaving a pet at home for them to take care of.

64,1ex0nib,WIBTA If I break my word and tell my fiancé his friend lied to him?,"I am a 32F, my fiance is 33M, and the friend in question is around our age M.  John is my fiance Mark's long time friend and John comes by once a week to work out with Mark and hang out.  John has a long history with a woman, June, who he has been in and out of a relationship with.  By all parties accounts, June is very toxic, an alcoholic, and makes John miserable every time they get back together.  Mark has expressed that he is fed up with watching John get mixed up with June time and again only for John to come vent to Mark when she inevitably makes John miserable.

Yesterday, John arrived before Mark came home from work.  I greeted him at the door and I could immediately see he was weathered.  When I asked what was wrong, he asked that if he told me that I not tell Mark.  I agreed.  He told me he had fucked up and reached out to June again and she had been trying to manipulate him into day drinking with her.  He expressed he didn't want Mark to know, because he knew Mark would give him a verbal lashing for getting back in contact with her.  I understood and was happy to keep this to myself and give emotional support, as I have been in many toxic relationships in the past and know how hard it is to get out of them.  Mark also has a very tough love style and doesn't beat around the bush when it comes to his opinions (personally, I adore this about him, but I've observed it can push away some people).

However, to my shock, as soon as Mark got home from work John went to him and instantly told him that June had ""messaged him out of the blue"" and was harassing him and wouldn't leave him alone.  I continued to overhear during their work out John spin a version of events to Mark where they could bash on June together and John was 100% innocent of the situation.

I am very conflicted now.  I was fine keeping John's situation private, but I don't like being a secret party to a lie where John can pretend he's being chased by a crazy woman instead of having a problem with continuing to return to the same poisoned watering hole and actively encouraging the bad relationship.

So reddit, would I be in the asshole if I told Mark the truth?

  
EDIT:  Thank you all so much for your thoughts.  I honestly didn't think I'd get more than a few responses.  After listening to you all, I first decided to talk to Mark.  

I talked to him about his boundaries concerning if someone we both knew asked one of us to keep something from the other.  He said ""I guess it depends on if it affects the other person"".  I decided for certain then those of you who said I should tell him were right and I did.  He wasn't upset with me, but is unhappy John would put me in a position like that.  He also realized that being so hard on John concerning June was pushing John deeper into her clutches.  We decided not to tell John about our conversation.  We also discussed further what either of us should do if the other person is asked to keep something a secret and decided we will do as many of you suggested and say ""I can't do that"".

I've also sent the following text to John:  ""I need to put down a boundary.  Don't confide something to me if you're going to turn around and sell Mark a false version. That doesn't sit right with me.  I'll keep your business private until your ready to open to another party, but I'm not willing to participate in a lie.""

Maybe in the past, prior to like 1.5-2 years ago, I did less, but even my wife acknowledges I have stepped it up a lot. Both my wife and I work full time at very good jobs. I do all the laundry once a week, I cook occasionally (my wife does not cook) and clean up after myself every time, I clean the house and take care of various household maintenance items, I manage our finances with advisors, I spend my middle of the week day off with my daughter one on one, and I would do more if I was allowed to. I would take both kids on my day off but was told “no it’s too much for one person.” I have offered multiple times to give them a bath but my wife refuses saying that “oh the kids aren’t used to you doing that stuff.” I sometimes feed them and change diapers but probably not as much as I should. I always “eat first” because I’m rushing through it so that I can take over from her and her parents to feed the kids. My wife and her parents are especially slow eaters and take 1-2 hours for every meal. I eat in 5-10 minutes and then take over so that everyone can eat but they complain that I don’t help feed the kids first.

She has cancer, has about the same.

Brother and his wife retired in their 50’s after selling her family’s business (inherited when her parents died), and they travel, and have 2 houses in the US and 1 in Italy. They have 3 kids.

Next sister’s husband is an exec for a big company. They travel with my brother a lot, and have 2 homes. Two kids.

Last sister is widowed. Her husband made over $1 million/yr. When he died, she told us he left her with about $10 million. She volunteers, chairs a running club, and audits college classes to keep busy. She has 2 kids.

I’ve struggled. In 2014 I got promoted. Then, in 2015, the company I was at got bought, and I was let go. I found a lower job with a pay cut. I was close to my 2015 salary when the pandemic shut down the new employer.

I found a FT job that was horrible, and was lucky to then find another job. I’m employed, but making less than 9 years ago. I contribute to my 401K, and I’m frugal. I drive a 2015 car, and I have some savings. This company is being bought, so my position will likely go away in 12-18 mos.

My oldest sis made me executor of their estate, and I’m happy to do it. Their will says everything’s split between her siblings. I think about how $500,000 won’t change my brothers and sisters lives; just a little windfall to toss in with the rest. For me? Life changing, but the full amount would mean that I can stress a whole lot less about money. I could live the life I’ve always watched them live.

I know I sound entitled and selfish. I’m grateful to be in the will at all, and I know I’m so, so much more fortunate than so many. It’s very hard to be so much younger and so much less successful than my sibs are/were.

I’ll watch my nieces and nephews inherit their parents’ money, and I’ll just live my modest life. Jealousy is horrible.

I’m thinking of asking my sister about the will, and if she’s thought of any of this. I am scared to be too blunt, and I might even chicken out. It feels wrong to ask her to exclude the others, but the money just won’t mean very much to them – they’re all wealthier than she is!

69,1ex08pp,AITA asking for reimbursement?,"AITA asking for reimbursement?

My group of friends (10 people+) went on a cabin trip. Our friend wanted to plan it out so we let her. She gave us the total amount each person had to pay, breaking it down to $200 per person. Give or take. 

Anyway she ended up buying a bunch of snacks that none of us ended up eating. Nor did she ask any of us what we wanted as snacks. She ended up taking all the snacks home with her after asking if anyone wanted them. (Clearly no one wanted to take them home.) 

After the trip I asked her if there was “leftover” money because I knew the total for the place itself was less than half the total we all pitched in for. & it just felt like we didn’t really have anything for the trip. 

The money was only spent on the place, food, & small amount of booze. 

She said “yeah but everyone will only get about $25 back.” I asked for my refund and she sent it saying “here’s $25 lol” 

I mean… that’s $250+ she’s keeping to herself?? I just felt like it was wrong of her to keep it considering she bought over $100 of snacks no one wanted nor asked for. 

Anyway it must’ve been a big deal for her bc she insinuated in a later trip that “she don’t want to host anymore because people don’t understand how stressful it is” 

None of us ever said it wasn’t stressful. She offered and literally demanded to host the trip. The problem is she kept inviting people who were outside the group and they would fall through and make the individual price go up more and more as the date got closer.

At work, my colleagues and I have this ongoing game where we use face-swapping apps to put each other's faces on famous people or characters from TV shows and movies. It's been a fun and lighthearted competition to see who can come up with the most creative or funny swap.

One day, I swapped my boss's face with Osama bin Laden. The result was a picture that had us all laughing for a good while. However, since that day, my boss has been noticeably distant. He’s withdrawn from our social group at work, often eating lunch alone, and the atmosphere has become awkward. This has also impacted our work, making it harder to meet our KPIs since we usually collaborate closely.

76,1ewyxkl,AITA for making my roommates ex contribute towards rent?,"I (27 F) live in an apartment with 3 other women. About 1 month ago, one of my roommates we’ll call Anya (32 F) moved her ex gf we’ll call Mel into our apartment without any sort of communication prior. I don’t know much about Mel, we met maybe 1.5 years ago with a quick introduction of her being Anya’s gf and kept it brief/cordial if we ran into each other after.

I started noticing Mel would be over A LOT more than usual. I didn’t know they broke up so just assumed they were still dating and spent a lot of time at ours. But then it got to a point where Mel would be there on her own, got a key, had guests over, slowly started bringing belongings in and storing them in our cabinets, and I heard her on the phone referring to Anya as someone she used to date and the apt as “where I’m calling home now.”

My other roommates and I called a meeting to discuss what the heck was actually going on. Anya told us that Mel was having problems at her apartment. Apparently one of Mel’s roommates is a squatter, the cops have been called on Mel more than once there, and there was some sort of physical altercation btwn the roommates. Mel and the other roommates left but are still on the hook for rent so their landlord is asking for $10k+ in back rent. Anya said that Mel has been living at our apartment since the beginning of last month and plans to be out around October (assuming things work out on her court date in Sept). 

My roommates and I said that we would feel more comfortable with her being here if she was contributing to our bills including rent. Anya pushed back and said that while she’ll collect some bills from Mel, she doesn’t agree with getting rent money from her bc she’s in a tough place. According to Anya, since Mel is only staying for a few months and our rent doesn’t increase with her being there, it’s unlawful for us to have her contribute to rent. My other roommates and myself believe that if someone is going to be fully living in our apartment for 1/4 of the year, they should be contributing to the household during that time. 

We’re only asking that she pay a few hundred in rent a month and split the other bills with us 5 ways. Anya is pretty insistent in telling us that we just have to be ok with Mel living at ours rent free and that Mel will split utilities “out of the kindness of her heart” 

We don’t have a super large apartment or much storage space at all so adding a 5th person to the mix has become a lot. I’m sympathetic towards Mel’s situation but me and my roommates don’t actually know Mel and didn’t agree to her living here in the first place.

My other roommates and myself believe that if someone is going to be fully living in our apartment for 1/4 of the year, they should be contributing to the household during that time. 

We’re only asking that she pay a few hundred in rent a month and split the other bills with us 5 ways. Anya is pretty insistent in telling us that we just have to be ok with Mel living at ours rent free and that Mel will split utilities “out of the kindness of her heart” 

We don’t have a super large apartment or much storage space at all so adding a 5th person to the mix has become a lot. I’m sympathetic towards Mel’s situation but me and my roommates don’t actually know Mel and didn’t agree to her living here in the first place. My other roommates wanna go to the landlord, I’d rather it not come to that but we’re now stuck in a living situation that we didn’t agree to and have no say in. I don’t wanna kick someone when they’re down but AITA for telling my roommate her ex needs to contribute to rent if she’s going to be living with us?",0.0,0.09777572751045227,0,1
77,1ewytht,AITA for not sharing a bed with my 8-year-old cousin?,"I(18F) have lived with my aunt(38F) and her son(8M) since I was 15 because of lots of drama surrounding my parents' divorce and the proximity of her house to my school. I graduated high school in June and went to live with my mom who told me I'd have to go back and stay with my aunt, so she's not left alone and to watch my cousin for her as well as help around the house as she had no helper.

At the start of summer, my cousin travelled, and my aunt moved in temporarily with her boyfriend until my cousin returned. Once he came back, my aunt said we'd head back to her home eventually. My cousin has not yet learnt how to be in a room by himself, he shares a room with his mom at her home and at her boyfriend's, I share a room with him so my aunt can stay with her bf.

Yesterday, we discovered my cousin has lice. I had just come back from a weekend at my mum's and found my aunt hadn't returned home yet. She said she found a treatment that could kill all the lice immediately, but I don't believe it. I didn't want to share a room with him and risk getting lice.

Later that night, I waited till he'd gone to bed and slept in the living room of the apartment. At about 3am, he woke up crying and woke up his mum who woke me up to go sleep with him in the bedroom. I tied my hair with a towel and placed a pillow to separate the two of us. I always put the pillow between us because my cousin is not very gentle in his sleep and has hit me multiple times in very sensitive places.

My aunt is very upset with me currently and is not the nicest when she's upset, she's giving me the silent treatment, she refuses to let me help out with cooking, she wouldn't let my cousin have me check his homework until she realized she needed me to do it.

79,1ewyb0x,WIBTA for putting up a doorbell camera to avoid my neighbour?,"I've got dogs and my neighbour recently got cats. My dogs don't like cats in general, and my dogs bark like mad when I open the front door and there's one of the cats outside.
Long story short, my neighbour has a go at me everyday for my dogs barking at the cats ""because it stresses them/my dogs are being aggressive/I'm a bad person etc"" and will come out/open the front door when she sees me leave with them for walks (they're always on a leash) and will sometimes actively bring a cat out with her. She won't come out or open the door when it's just me.

I do my best to ignore the shouting but I'm thinking it's time to install a camera to monitor if a) there's a cat outside and b) to avoid times when she might be in.
Potential problem is that it's a shared path to the road and I'm not sure if that might aggravate matters further or if it'll send a message.

Would putting a camera up make me an asshole?

82,1ewxkok,AITA for not letting my bf grieve?,"

Backstory: My boyfriend’s grandpa passed away 4 days ago. When he passed we met all of his family at a small ER to say our goodbyes. The ER made everyone wear masks. Due to a sickness going around the hospital. 

So 2 days ago I started to feel really bad body aches, sore throat etc. Keep in mind I’m 18 weeks pregnant. I told him how I felt and he basically said he doesn’t want to get sick because his grandpas funeral is coming up. I told him I was feeling weak as well as hungry and didn’t want to drive myself home then be hungry once I got there. I asked him if he was okay with helping me for the night and I’ll leave in the morning. Basically just bring me some food to the room so I wouldn’t contaminate any other areas of the house. He told me he had a lot on his mind and wasn’t in the right head space to help me. So I told him I understand and left. 

When I got home I made something small to eat then went to sleep. Yesterday morning he calls and checks on me. I tell him how I feel more sick than when I left. He just says okay. The rest of the day he has family over until about 3am just offering their condolences and keeping his family company. Around 4pm I called and asked him for help to see if he could bring me something to eat because all I had the strength to get myself were just snacks like chips, cereal. No real meals and I wanted to make sure I had enough in me for the baby. He basically brushed me off saying he has no idea how he could help and said I was selfish for not thinking about him grieving and how he was stressed and had a million things on his mind. He also told me that I was being evil because I said he wasn’t helping me at all. After that I just hung up. He called me at 3am when everyone left to sleep on the phone with me but hung up 20 mins later said he would call back but didn’t. Now I don’t want to speak to him at all. But don’t want to cause him more stress when he’s already sad about his grandpa. 

I want to know if I’m an AH for not respecting his time for grieving. Also would I be an AH for not talking to him today. I know how It feels to lose your grandpa when you’re so close with him. But at the same time I just asked for a little bit of help and don’t feel like I was asking him for a lot. Most medications you can’t take during pregnancy because they have bad side effects for the fetus. So I’ve just been waiting It out and he knows that as well. 

Update: It’s been decided I am the AH here and that is fine. But for the ones wondering about DoorDash and other options. I recently just paid my bills and I made groceries for his place since I would be there with him during this time. So unfortunately I cannot afford DoorDash at the moment but that would’ve been my first option. I didn’t bring any food with me because all of the groceries really have to be cooked besides snacks. Also I know he is grieving and would’ve never said anything but if he was okay enough to do favors for others yesterday he could’ve picked up some food and left It at my door step. Didn’t even have to come inside. Also I have family and friends but getting them to do things for me is a bit of a challenge and I learned a while ago to stop asking. It’s really just been me and him caring for one another. But after reading some of your comments I understand how I came off as needy. Thank You for your responses 🫶🏾🫶🏾

Edit: I speak to my family everyday we are close in that way. I see them every week as well. No bad blood between us. My friends don’t live close to me to where it’s easy to just drop off food and go. My parents on the other hand do. But now that I’m an adult and since my other siblings have had children my parents tend to them. I have two siblings who aren’t in their kids lives atm due to their own faults so my parents step in. When I ask for help where they have to physically do something since I was a kid It was always I’m tired this or I do t feel like going here that. But when they ask me they feel like im just supposed to do whatever It is they ask. So yea I never call on them first. I call on my boyfriend we’ve been together 3 years.

83,1ewxg15,AITA for uninviting my family to my wedding ,"Bear with me, this is my first post!

I (30F) have never really gotten along well with my uncle (married into the family), his wife is my aunt and sadly I think he's rubbed off on her and they've raised their kids with their mindset and values. Naturally. Largely this stems to his political views which are gross but, he also has this demeanor of being better than everyone and if you've been to Tenerife he's been to Elevenerife. 

Anyway, over the years I've had plenty of pointed remarks from my uncle about my perceived alcohol intake. I did party a lot during college but, having grown up whilst I still like to party I leave it to special occasions. He has implied I am an alcoholic before. 
My aunt has also made pointed remarks independently. 
My eldest cousin from that set has made pointed remarks. He was too young to remember my college days but it appears his parents have said something. 

Fast forward to now, we went out for a family birthday dinner and my youngest cousin from that set said ""you've always got a drink in your hand, haven't you?"" To which I replied to say I only ever saw them at celebrations, we see each other less than twice a year. He then called me an alcoholic to my face. I called him out for it and he looked absolutely mortified. He did actually then call me and apologize and it was a very good apology. 

I am not fond of this part of the family for many reasons but, having had it from all angles I am truly fed up. The fact that the two cousins are so confortabke talking about what they think I drink tells me his parents have spoken about it at home. Whilst the youngest has apologized, none of the others ever have. I had invited them to my wedding reception to keep the peace with my dad and grandparents but, they can go and whistle IMO.

My husband (33m) and I had already been together for 6 years so the next step was to get married and we talked about the move before it.  I moved, settled in, got an apartment, then went back and got married and brought him along. We had talked about how he was going to make a living in the new country before and agreed that he would get a year to try and make a music career happen. This was always his dream. At the time, my salary was enough to give both of us a comfortable living situation, although it left no room for savings and barely any room for emergencies. 

He moved, we started going to jam sessions for him to meet musicians, something that would help him start bringing in money. We purchased stuff that allowed him to record for YT.

First he refused to go out anywhere on his own. jam sessions were happening on several days of the week, either I had to go to every one of them with him or he wouldnt go. 

He started spending most of his time playing ps or smoking weed. 

He asked that I take care of 50% of the housework as he didn't have any time to work. At the time he said this, we were doing big house cleanings on the weekends together. I was doing all the shopping, dinner cooking. We did laundry and dishes together. He only had to make and eat his own breakfast, clean the litter box every morning and vacuum the floor for 20 mins because of the litter. I tried to meet in the middle on that one and told him we can do the vacuuming after I get home from work. He refused. I was already tapped out. 

He complained that I stopped taking care of myself. He saw some hairs, he thought I was fat (which I was, but trying to lose weight too, successfully, I lost 30 kgs since I met him), he didnt like the way I dressed around him, said my pyjamas looked like they were a villager's.

Meanwhile, there was no YT, no jam sessions, no independency. He was just at home waiting for me to feed and entertain him. It made me feel like I was being used. 

So I decided to say something when 9 months had passed. We have not stopped fighting since. He announced to our parents that he wanted a divorce 2 times already. Both times he backed out. He says he still had time and that I am doing his head in while his time hasnt even lapsed. I told him I wouldve loved to keep my mouth shut if I saw effort but he wasnt doing anything and if anything were to happen to me, we would be out on the street in a foreign country, unable to pay the bills and would have to go back . I told him I did not believe he understood the urgency. Just because he had 1 year, did not mean he had to wait until day 364 to make his first dollar. He had to try from day 1. He called me selfish and obsessed with money. He also said I was acting like the man in the house and was walking manly.

",Not the A-hole,2024-08-20,"AITA for asking my husband to earn money before our deal ended? I (32f) moved to a different country with a job offer about 1,5 years ago. My husband (33m) and I had already been together for 6 years so the next step was to get married and we talked about the move before it.  I moved, settled in, got an apartment, then went back and got married and brought him along. We had talked about how he was going to make a living in the new country before and agreed that he would get a year to try and make a music career happen. This was always his dream. At the time, my salary was enough to give both of us a comfortable living situation, although it left no room for savings and barely any room for emergencies. 

He moved, we started going to jam sessions for him to meet musicians, something that would help him start bringing in money. We purchased stuff that allowed him to record for YT.

86,1ewxcr5,AITA for confronting my husband for double booking our date? ,"So here is some background for reference: husband and I have been married for almost 15 years, no children. We moved into a home and were unprepared for about $25,000 worth of repairs after we closed on our home about a year ago. We both have multiple jobs to offset this (we both have one full time job and then we both have a part-time job to address the added costs). Because of this, our time together has been very limited. I miss him. So, as part of my birthday weekend (because my real birthday fell on a Monday) we decided to make sure we’re both off on Saturday where we can go to our favorite winery and eat some oysters that we love at the local oyster bar. Then we would get to spend the evening together. We planned this about a month in advance. Yesterday was my birthday and my husband informs me that he has fantasy football on the day we have planned. I was a little shocked by this so I didn’t make a fuss about it. But the more I thought about it over the night, the more upset I became by it. So this morning I told him that I was really looking forward to our day together and I’m hurt that our day is going to be impacted by fantasy football. The winery and oyster bar we like to go to is about 2 hours away from our home, so being back in time for his fantasy football get together will impact how much time we have there. Moreover, if we do go to the winery and oyster bar my focus now on this day will be about how much time we have left before we have to leave rather than having no time constraints at all. Overall, I’m just really disappointed. This day was not only supposed to be to celebrate my birthday (last year of my 30’s), but more importantly, this was an opportunity to spend some much needed quality time together without any other distractions. When I told my husband about my feelings this morning, he became defensive citing his limited schedule to do things (which he is correct). I acknowledged this, but also pointed out that we had these plans in advance.  Maybe it wasn’t fair for me to say, but I did tell him that I would have put him as a priority and that I was always taught that once you make plans, you stick with them, not making new plans if they end up popping up. Well, that comment didn’t go over very well. Anyway, at this point (and not out of hate) I feel like we should just wait to reschedule the day all together. But on a side note, he took off another day in which there is a Nirvana cover band playing in September on a Friday in which I can’t go because I’m working but he will go to that with his friends. To be fair, he offered me one of the seats to the table he reserved on that date, but I turned it down because I’m working, and I’m fee-for-service and I’m trying to make up for time lost when I had Covid. 

I guess I just need guidance and maybe some clarity… AITA for confronting him that I’m feeling upset that he didn’t make me a priority on this day we had planned in advance?

87,1ewxbqx,AITA for sending my husband’s clothes in a cab after he asked me to come over? ,"
I (24f) and my husband (30m) have been together for 6 years and married for less than 1. We have mutual friends, mostly his friends that became mine. We hang out at each others houses and go out monthly on double/ triple dates. 

So, today I had to see doctor because I was having a fever and was diagnosed with a virus causing me to have flu, cough, fever. I also have headaches on and off. My husband left to go to one of his friends (30m) house at about 1pm. I left for the doctors at 3pm and  I came home at about 4pm. My husband gave me a call at 8pm asking me if I am coming over to the friends house. 
*Context: before he left, he did ask me if I will be going over and I told him “most likely no but least likely yes”. 

I took a 4 hour ‘nap’ after eating my medications. And at that moment was feeling better. So I told him yes. Then 4 mins later he called me again asking me if I could bring extra clothes for him so he could sleep over at the friends house. When I asked, “what about me” his reply was, “you can stay over if you want too or go back home”. I was quite taken aback because first of all I’m sick. Second of all, I have to take a cab to travel all the way to the other side of town, pass him some clothes and hang out with our friends for a few hours before taking another cab back home. Each cab ride costs about $30. 

So I told him I would send the clothes over to him in the cab and he can collect it. He called me an asshole for not coming. 

I messaged him telling him “Just so you know, if i was feeling well I wouldn’t have mind that you went to friend’s place and hang out with him or staying over. I’m sick so I didn’t come. I have to respect their family and not get anyone there sick. I have a virus and it could be infectious. Friend’s parents are old and her mum is already sick, I don’t want her to get more sick because of me putting her at risk” 

He apologised by saying “No im not angry for you not coming. I was just trying my luck to see if you would come. So sorry for asking you to come. This won’t happen in the future again”. 

He FaceTimed me 10 minutes after sending me the apology message to remind me to eat my medicines. After a while of two of us not talking (just awkward silence) I said bye. He told me I had an attitude, I just said ok and cut the line. 
*in my defence he wasn’t talking to me and I had nothing to say to him. So what’s the point of the phone call?* 

Him calling me an asshole reminded me of this thread, and I want to know if I actually was in the wrong for not going over? 

I think I might have been the asshole because I could have just gone over to hang out with all of our friends especially since I was feeling better and said I would come (before he told me he was staying over) and also I could have said something in the FaceTime call instead of just saying “ok” and hanging up. It did kinda seem like an asshole move especially since he apologised. 

Edit *thank you everyone for your comments. I see what wrong I’ve done here and shouldn’t have even thought about going to see my friends while I’m sick. I used the excuse of having to bring the clothes over as an excuse to be angry at my husband for not coming home and I should have better communication that. Moving forward, I’ll take better responsibility for both myself and others around me and I will do better to communicate with my husband. Thank you again!

89,1ewx73c,AITA For reporting one of my room mates as racist to our housing staff?,"So, I stay within a shared housing development for “Unhoused Young Adults” and while here it’s not often I get into confrontational or argumentative situations with the other residents or even staff, this is sadly one of those exceptions.

We’ve mandatory cleaning every Sunday, which I’m genuinely glad we do, with groups of people assigned to different jobs, some even assigned towards the bathroom as we’ve no custodians of our own. So about a month ago on chore day I ended up in an argument with one of the other residents, we can call Kai, over when I should or shouldn’t be using the bathroom as there where already two people in there cleaning and not as an excuse but as an clarification to be honest it’s the only bathroom on the male side and only one of them was actually cleaning. 

Long story short we went our separate ways with me over hearing Kai talking shit about me as my room isn’t too far from the bathroom. I really am not the confrontational type though and most insults don’t get to me, let alone the fact of my living situation, so It’s been easier for me to put a lot of things into perspective of importance over the past few months and I’d been wiling to let it slide. Until the chiding went to racial territory.



So, as another clarification I live in Hawai’i, where it’s a common cultural normalcy here of chiding each other and joking over race due to how mixed and diverse the populace is. I’m West Papuan and Black so it’s always a surprise with family visiting from out of state and their reactions towards all of the jokes referencing people’s phenotypes or race but I think I may be desensitized to it. You might be able to see why it was hard for me to make distinction at first, as to when it’s good old ripping on someone and when do they mean it…

I only started to think they meant it when they open with the gossiping by saying “I’ve plenty of dirt on you/negative shit to say, coming at me like that” with some of the stuff being said like “My hair is so nappy, and your so dark”. Kai on the regular (cause it’s also common that a lot of people here do) says and calls my n-word as a form of way to address me on the regular, and yelling things like “Wakanda forever” and shouting things like “HOHOHO!”.



It doesn’t one hundred percent matter, but he is very much not black, so I go to staff within the shelter to report about the incident, and it’s blown off by him, just reportedly going around saying “I ain’t/didn’t say shit” and every interaction between me and others here has this tension over it because I can passively hear, outwardly see, or are sometimes just told by others of his constant asking and mentioning over what we’ve going on, and that tension between me and Kai never went away.

But I’m to scared to say anything directly to him due to company of guys he keeps and not wanting to seem like the singled out person/ a Karen, I can’t even tell if whether or not I’d anything to complain about or if it was that deep about to begin with… AITA?

91,1ewwvll,AITA for not responding to my best friend's texts after all that she told me ? ,"So this morning I was telling my best friend about a small interaction with my office ""crush"". And after she was like what are you doing with you life ? I was like why ? She referred to my past fling where I got hurt and asked me if I didn't want to settle with only one and also told me that she understands this is the age for fun and sexual pleasure but I should also concentrate on building my life so I don't grow old in my current company where I have been for 3 years now.

But what she didn't know and what I told her today was that I had got 200+ rejection mails in the past few months and calls from unknown companies. I told her that I am desperately looking for a job change for the past year but can't seem to find one. I told her that I have lost all motivation and confidence and don't want to live anymore and that I was looking and interacting with the guy at work as a distraction and that I actually wouldn't get him because I never the men I want. And she's asked me if I believed in God and i responded by saying not anymore since I lost my mom and I'm not ahead in my career nor my love life no matter how much I pray and try to land one. 

It hurt me that she thinks I am only interested in having flings and I'm not worried about my life. I am extremely worried about my career and my love life as I'll turn 25 this December but I don't share with everyone and I'm ashamed to share this with my best friend because she's already on her second job and bought a car. All my friends have landed their second jobs and I'm still stuck with the first. She's also never had any relationship or fling and is constantly working.

So I told her in anger that I wouldn't tell her anything and she wouldn't understand me. And I felt annoyed that just because she is always working and isn't dating or trying to date or have fun that doesn't mean I have to do the same. She texted me later but I'm still feeling defensive and annoyed to text her back. I know she's looking out for me but still I cannot help but not talk right now. AITA here ?

So this morning I was telling my best friend about a small interaction with my office ""crush"". And after she was like what are you doing with you life ? I was like why ? She referred to my past fling where I got hurt and asked me if I didn't want to settle with only one and also told me that she understands this is the age for fun and sexual pleasure but I should also concentrate on building my life so I don't grow old in my current company where I have been for 3 years now.

But what she didn't know and what I told her today was that I had got 200+ rejection mails in the past few months and calls from unknown companies. I told her that I am desperately looking for a job change for the past year but can't seem to find one. I told her that I have lost all motivation and confidence and don't want to live anymore and that I was looking and interacting with the guy at work as a distraction and that I actually wouldn't get him because I never the men I want. And she's asked me if I believed in God and i responded by saying not anymore since I lost my mom and I'm not ahead in my career nor my love life no matter how much I pray and try to land one. 

It hurt me that she thinks I am only interested in having flings and I'm not worried about my life. I am extremely worried about my career and my love life as I'll turn 25 this December but I don't share with everyone and I'm ashamed to share this with my best friend because she's already on her second job and bought a car. All my friends have landed their second jobs and I'm still stuck with the first. She's also never had any relationship or fling and is constantly working.

So I told her in anger that I wouldn't tell her anything and she wouldn't understand me. And I felt annoyed that just because she is always working and isn't dating or trying to date or have fun that doesn't mean I have to do the same. She texted me later but I'm still feeling defensive and annoyed to text her back. I know she's looking out for me but still I cannot help but not talk right now. AITA here ?

93,1ewwefw,AITA for making a formal complaint to my school?,"Hi there, NB21 here. I feel really bad about this so I thought I'd see what everyone thinks. So, for context, I live on campus in a small college that honestly doesn't really have great facilities and such when it comes to housing anyway. The bathrooms and halls are usually pretty gross and not cleaned for a while, along with repairs which usually take a long time. (I once only had half a dresser and it took facilities a little over three weeks to fix it.) 


Anyway, I've recently been using the disabled bathrooms as they've been the ones closed to me, but I quickly realized a problem that I kind of already knew about already. The bathrooms themselves are fine, whatever, but the showers inside are just awful. They're borderline completely unusable, and it actually made me feel worse than I did before just taking a shower because it took so much out of me. 

To explain: I am quite physically weak and have been suffering from fatigue as well, and in order to just turn the shower on, I had to use all the force I had within me and more. It took a lot out of me, and along with that, the shower curtain broke and I had to take the whole shower without one. I was pretty pissed and upset and I've already been through this situation before. The last time I used one I had the same physical problems and it caused me distress, but also I had problems with the detachable shower head, which kept detaching and I ended up having to just hold it over my head as I showered. So, by now, I was pretty upset by all of this and wanted something to be done about it. 

I found the formal complaints form and went through the process, but I feel I may have been too harsh because I was pretty angry when I did it and I called the bathrooms horrible, and that they made disabled bathrooms worse for disabled people (true) and such. But I didn't go through the school or anything with this to try and fix it because I kind of assumed they couldn't do anything about it as we don't really have the financial aid or facilities required to deal with it. I guess I was wrong and I'm working with some people at the school to fix it, but I didn't do that before I submitted the complaint, and I heard back from the school saying they received my complaint and I feel kinda bad about the things I said now.

Or if I'm too gay for them. But my parents are shitty parents to me. They are the worst. I know teenagers say that all the time but I am positive my parents despise me.

They're short tempered with me, they have no patience for anything I do. If my sister does something wrong, like she breaks something or does her chores badly I get yelled at. Not her, me. They blame me for her making mistakes and if I make mistakes I get yelled at and punished. They berate me for getting Bs and Cs. They call me stupid. They tell me my sister was more intelligent at 2 than I ever was. They display her grades on the fridge. They even framed some of them. They'll boast about us to other people and then tell me I'm am embarrassment when people leave. If I want to do something it's an automatic no while they say yes to my sister most of the time.

My parents started calling me stupid a few years ago and my sister copied them. She tells me all the time they're great parents and I should be nicer. She scolds me for complaining about them. She had the nerve to tell me I should be nicer after she broke one of mom's vases and mom yelled at me.

97,1ewvoe9,AITA for refusing to spend time with my boyfriend’s mom and her new girlfriend?,"My (25F) boyfriend (24M) and I have been together for 3 years now, and I originally thought his mom (59F, I will call her Mary) liked me, but ever since she initiated her divorce, there is always tension when she's around.



Basically, this all started around christmas last year when Mary started fighting with bf's other mom (63F, will call her Jane)and insisting Jane has always been emotionally distant and my boyfriend and Mary start getting upset and excluding her from family time because she’s causing their marriage to fall apart. By February, they decided to seperate and then divorce, and then it came out that Mary fell in love with a woman who had rented out their house while the family was on vacation and that she ALSO divorced her spouse. Mary and her girlfriend are now living together and the divorce hasn't actually started yet. 



Honestly, not my circus, not my monkeys, but my bf is much closer to Mary than he is to Jane, so when Mary rants about the latest inconvenience in the divorce, regardless of how valid Jane’s concerns or demands are, he's very quick to defend her while refusing to speak to Jane at all. It’s his own relationship with his parents, so I’m not getting involved but I’m often shocked at the current dynamic.



My boyfriend and I had an unrelated fight, and Mary took the opportunity to tell him how much she doesn’t like me. She told him that I have too many needs and, I quote, that I “should find a proper job first and won’t find anyone who will date me properly until \[I’ve\] figured out how to have fewer needs”. By needs, she’s referring to the fact that I’m not in contact with my parents and that I often need to send my sister money while being in a phd program rather than working full time (plus I am actively in treatment for an autoimmune disease at the moment), which I just thought was extremely weird because it’s not like my boyfriend is involved in those problems. On top of that, she’s developed this habit of asking me questions and then talking over me before I can answer, and when she wants to have coffee with me, all she talks about is my boyfriend when he was a kid and when he was a baby. So I just stopped hanging out with her because it felt more like she was initiating some kind of contest with me than building a relationship.



My boyfriend told me that for Christmas this year, we will probably spend it with Mary’s family, which is fine, Mary and I are cordial enough. But I told him that if Mary’s girlfriend is there that I will not be attending, and that I will not be attending any kind of event or dinner where she’s there.



I think it’s too much emotional energy for me and not my business to get to know her, especially with the drama attached. Second of all, I feel like Mary has been incredibly unhinged lately.

100,1ewu9ym,AITA for not financially helping in our household at 16,"PS: English is not my first language so I apologize for the errors.  
  
I (16M) have always been independent. Growing up as a middle child, oftentimes ignored, I always did my homework by myself. Never asked for any help from my brothers, sisters, and from my parents. My mother had no work and my father worked abroad, I don't talk to my father that much because he never really initiated them in the first place, to be honest, I am not that comfortable talking to him like a friend. Despite really needing a father figure in my life, I just accepted that he had to do it for our family to survive.  
  
Everyone had high expectations of me, graduating from elementary as a Valedictorian, I was tasked with the burden of being successful for my family. The first ""Latin Honors"", they said. Those expectations overwhelmed me, as cliched as it may sound, I was just a kid.  
  
Back to the pandemic, two years ago, I saw my family struggling. So as an independent, intelligent, always-knowing teenager, I stepped up. I had a freelancing gig and had my first payout, I was so happy to know that I could help in our household and not seem useless. I paid for our bills, this went on for at least 3 months. After that, I stopped since classes were starting.  
  
Months came by and I took on another freelancing job—a long-term one. This time though, I did not tell my mother directly. Since I still went to school, the money I received from my job was the only thing I relied on. I did not rely on my family anymore because I thought they already had enough on their plate. They were always ""Sorry, I already used our money for our food."" and I would always say ""It's okay,"" but it wasn't, deep inside I wished they were there not just financially but mentally, and physically they were there for me.

Suddenly, my mother took notice that I could finally buy things for myself and do things by myself. This is when we got more disconnected. Every time there was an occasion or every time I went out, she would always expect that I would have something for her. Now my job wasn't that stable, and sometimes my money would be lacking. Recently, my sister got into an accident and it was quite expensive, I understood that we would have to cut corners. 

Now, my mother always complains about our bills, about us having no food on the table, seemingly insinuating that since I have a job, and receive money from that job, I should be paying for our bills (again) and helping with the groceries. My father still gives us money but most of the time it is not enough. What pissed me off is when my mother still asked my father for a new watch, but still ironically complain about our lifestyle here.  
  
However, I never gave in to that, Up until now, I still minded my own business, even though my family was slowly deteriorating, even though my parent rubbed it in my face that they had always supported me, given me a roof to live in, prepared food for me to digest, and guilt-tripped me.

101,1ewu5k0,WIBTA for being honest about the real reason I'm moving out after my friend ignored me while I was grieving?,"A few months ago I lost an immediate family member very suddenly & unexpectedly. The day I got the call I went to my roommate “R” & told him what happened. I was of course very upset & while he said ""I'm sorry,"" I could feel how uncomfortable he was w/ my emotions, so I quickly excused myself to my room to be alone. He continued to watch tv & never came to check on me, which at the time I brushed off as him wanting to give me space, but that ""I'm sorry"" turned out to be the first & only time he acknowledged he knows/cares about what I'm going through.

It was clear to me after two weeks of barely seeing him when he usually camped out in the shared spaces that he was intentionally avoiding being in the same room w/ me. The longer it went on the more I started to feel hurt & resentful. It would be one thing if he were only a roommate, but here's a guy I've known since high school ignoring me & not even asking me the bare minimum ""How are you doing?"" It's been almost 3 months now & he's yet to even ONCE ask me that. I've followed his cues & have just completely avoided the subject, going so far as to not tell him that I wasn't going to be home for a week to attend the funeral. A part of me did it to be petty/as a kind of experiment to see if he would ever ask me where I was. It took him 4 DAYS to shoot a text asking if I was gonna be home that night & when I said no there were no follow up questions. When I came home 3 days later he barely acknowledged me & I took it as the final sign our friendship was over.

I started looking for other places to live but w/ housing the way it is I've yet to be successful. During this time, though, my dynamic w/ R has slowly been improving, at least on the surface. I've always been someone who defaults to being polite/civil even w/ someone I can't stand, so when he slowly started to acknowledge my presence again I was willing to be conversational/even joke around a bit when he initiated it. I still don't think our friendship can go back to how it was, but at least we’re speaking.

I'm also at a place where I don't really feel the need to confront him about his behavior anymore. It feels like the time for acknowledging/discussing all that has passed. The only thing I'm debating on now is how honest I'm going to be about my reasons for moving out. I've finally heard back from a couple places so this is probably my last few weeks on the lease (we're month to month). I'm not sure how much of a surprise it’s going to come to him & I'm not sure what to say if he asks me why I'm leaving. A small part of me still wants to tell him how fucked up his behavior was, but the less asshole-ish part of me wants to give him another excuse & just leave it at that. I've had enough negativity in my life recently & while it might be cathartic to speak my mind, it also might not be worth it to dig all that up again. So I guess my question is less WIBTA & more would it be WORTH IT to be TA?

102,1ewu51s,AITA for expecting my bridesmaids to not invoice me for my hen party two weeks before my wedding ? ,"I have two friends from school. One of them (bridesmaid a) is married and two years ago I organised her hen party which was a weekend away for 14 people. Our other friend (bridesmaid b) was supposed to help and did nothing.

18 months ago I got engaged and asked bridesmaid a and b to be my bridesmaids and for bridesmaid a to organise my hen party. I asked for this to be a day in London as I didn't want it to cost lots or be too tricky to organise. I also sent them a liberty beauty advent calendar to ask them to be bridesmaids and agreed to pay for two nights accommodation, their hair and makeup and dresses. 

Bridesmaid A then got pregnant and had a baby. Four months before my hen she messaged saying she couldn't organise the hen party anymore because of the baby. She is on mat leave for a year and doesn't have postnatal depression. Bridesmaid b didn't step up so I then had to plan and organise my own hen party for 16 people in London. 

On the Day I organised and paid for all the transport and also heavily subsidised the hen party. In total the hen party cost 150-260 pounds for atandees depending on what they opted in for and including everything bar drinks at lunch.  At the lunch Bridesmaid B said I shouldn't pay for the lunch and so settled up the bill which was 500 pounds. This was two months ago. I made it clear to both bridesmaids at the time I was upset they hadn't stepped up and I had to organise my own hen party. 

I'm getting married in two weeks time and bridesmaid b has now decided to message me about the bill and ask me to sort it out as she has a credit card bill in 48 hours. She's also lost the receipt and said I should have chased her on the bill. I'm so upset! I've paid her and now gone out to the attendees to ask them for 15 extra pounds two months later to cover the lunch drinks. I completely lost my head over this as I have so much to organise for the wedding in 10 days time. AITA?

105,1ewtr6c,AITA for refusing to let my boyfriend’s friend move in with us?,"
Hi, Reddit. I’m Sofia (28F), and I’ve been with my boyfriend, Jake (30M), for about two years. We’ve been living together in my apartment for the past year, and while things have been mostly good, we’ve hit a bit of a bump.

Jake has a close friend, Mark (30M), who recently went through a rough breakup and lost his apartment in the process. Mark has been couch-surfing with various friends, and now Jake wants him to move in with us “for a little while” until Mark can get back on his feet.

I’ve met Mark a few times, and while he’s nice enough, I’m not comfortable with the idea of him moving in. For one, our apartment is small—a one-bedroom—and having a third person here would make things cramped. Also, I value my privacy and the time Jake and I have together. I’m also worried that “a little while” might turn into a long time, especially since Mark doesn’t have a solid plan for getting a new place.

I told Jake how I felt, and he got really upset. He said that Mark is his best friend and that if the roles were reversed, he’d expect Mark to help him out. Jake thinks I’m being selfish and unsupportive. He even offered to let Mark sleep on the couch and promised it wouldn’t be for long, but I’m still not okay with it.

Now, Jake is distant and cold, and it’s making things really tense between us. My friends are divided—some think I should just let Mark stay because it’s the right thing to do, while others agree that it’s my home too and I shouldn’t have to compromise my comfort.

My assistant manager told me that she has severe neck pain. She ended up taking a leave for 3 weeks, and came back with a neck brace. She proceeded to tell the whole office about how she’s going for physiotherapy, and she needs to go to back to her home country for treatment. Since we sit next to each other, i waited for her to get back to her seat so that I could ask her about it in private. I then asked her if she requires surgery, and the woman just started yelling at me. She said it was a horrible for me to say and i had to hear that rubbish in front of so many other colleagues.

Another colleague backed her by saying that I did a similar thing before by telling her that she’s lucky that she hasn’t had a wisdom tooth extraction (For context: One day, we were sent a flier from some company about the dental services they offer, and we started discussing  the procedures we’ve had like braces or teeth whitening and so on, and I told them I had a wisdom tooth removal a few months ago and it was very painful, and she’s lucky it she hasn’t had to get it removed).

I don’t understand how it’s a bad thing to ask someone if they require a surgery to have a medical problem fixed. I only asked her because I was concerned for her, not because I want her to have to go through something so painful.

Btw this manager sits next to me and we have chill conversations all the time. Was what I said really that bad?

While inspecting the house, I noticed the poor state of the wiring and called my dad for advice. He confirmed it’s a serious safety hazard. My partner overheard and got upset, accusing me of being intrusive and saying it was none of my dad’s business. I argued that safety should come first and suggested everyone pitch in an extra 15€ to install a protection relay and fix the sockets.

My partner overheard and got upset, accusing me of being intrusive and saying it was none of my dad’s business. I argued that safety should come first and suggested everyone pitch in an extra 15€ to install a protection relay and fix the sockets.

Think of like a normal garage at a normal house but they are wider to fit two cars.  We each are allotted 8 feet 1 inch of space. My neighbor drives a large 4runner. She parks 9 inches over the space and it prevents me from parking my car in the garage. I usually manage but she sometimes parks further and I literally cannot fit into the garage.

  
If I street park I get a ticket. So first time this happened I called, texted, and knocked on her door to move her car over.

110,1ews2gy,AITA (27F) for keeping my friend (27F) in the loop about the tour charges?,"
My friend and I were supposed to go to a Cornwall tour on the bank holiday weekend and we’d already paid for the advance. 

She unfortunately cannot make it and the company is not allowing us to cancel the trip as the booking is confirmed.
The friend got a cancer scare and she’s figuring out what her options are in terms of getting tested and that’s why she’s cancelling. 

I’m leaving the country forever the next weekend and I’m also coping up with the packing, couriering, saying bye to friends, and stuff like that. I barely have any money left because I spent a lot on all of the packing and couriering and I was also hesitant about the Cornwall trip since I have to spend a lot but I barely had any savings left. 


Since the booking is in my name, the company has been asking me for money everyday and I simply don’t have double the amount to pay them. I am looking for a replacement for her for the tour but it’s difficult since the weekend is almost here. I asked her politely yesterday if it could be possible for her to send me the money but she said she wants to prioritise her options for medical stuff first which I understand. I felt very shitty yesterday about the whole situation and apologised to her since for bringing up the payment, but I genuinely have a lot on my plate as well that I’m struggling to cope up with. 

Now the company called me again today, and even keeps calling my emergency contact, they’re being very rude and I decided to borrow money from my dad to pay them the amount. I just looped her in and told her that I’m paying the entire amount today and she can pay me back when she can, that there’s no rush. She immediately sent me the money and said ‘I know it’s been a hassle for you as well, I’m sorry about this. Just wanted to end this subject.’

Now I feel like an asshole again for being inconsiderate when she’s going through so much. So, AITA?

111,1ewrrpw,AITA for telling my parents they became liars the second they started fostering their adopted daughter?,"My parents started fostering when I (19f) was 6. My younger brother was 3 at the time. I never had a problem with it. It was normal and I got along with a lot of the foster siblings who came to live with us. This then changed with Amy.

I met Amy in second grade. She was new to my class and we just did not get along. I remember other kids saying she was mad at me and I had no idea why. We only knew each other for a few days at that point. I remember thinking if she was mad at me for nothing then I was mad at her. We clashed a lot. Then in third grade she started bullying me. She'd throw my lunch on the floor and step on it, she'd make up lies about me farting to get other kids to make fun of me, she told the teacher she wouldn't sit/work with ""freaky eye"", I have a scar across my left eye. She'd also say I was evil like Scar from The Lion King. The scar gave her plenty of ammunition and eventually I became very self-conscious of this. My parents knew about the bullying and they were called in to speak to teachers and the principal over the bullying.

Turns out Amy was a foster kid. Guess who decided to take her in? My parents. We were 10. My parents decided to adopt her. My parents were asked how I felt about it by a lot of people. They lied and said I was good with it and I was excited to help Amy and get along with her better. It was a lie. I screamed the house down when I found out and begged my parents not to.

My brother didn't like Amy either. She had used him against me so many times at school and he knew about it. My parents blamed me for my brother and Amy not getting closer. When I was 15 we had this really big fight. My parents told me Amy was as much my sibling as my brother was and they weren't happy that I didn't acknowledge her as such. I told them I never would. That they could adopt her 100 times and I still wouldn't call her my sister. I told them they chose helping her over protecting me. I told them I wish she had stayed in foster care forever and that nobody had ever loved her, because she was a bully and I was tired of being her target. I told them she had won though. She had them and I would never see them the same way again.

A year later Amy and I got into a fight and I was allowed to go and live with my grandparents. My parents tried to keep in touch with me but I made no effort. And eventually I started telling people my parents had lied about me wanting them to foster and adopt Amy. People treat my parents differently as a result and they confronted me about this a three weeks ago. They showed up at my grandparents and said we needed to talk. They mentioned me calling them liars and I said they were and they became liars the second they started fostering Amy. My parents told me I had such a selfish outlook of the situation. I told them they chose Amy. So I didn't owe them or her a selfless outlook.

112,1ewrceq,AITA for telling my parents I don't want to go back to the way things were when my half siblings lived with us?,"I had this fight with my parents the other night. My mom had been working on convincing her older kids, who are my half siblings, to come to our house for Christmas this year. When they were talking about it they were telling me how nice it would be for things to go back to the way they were when my half siblings lived here and we were all together as a family. I told them I don't want to go back to the way things were back then and I told them it actually sounded like a nightmare. My parents were so surprised I'd say something like that. They told me it was hard to imagine I didn't miss my older siblings. I told them it was never exactly happy when they were living here.

To explain what I mean. My half siblings are 24 and 22. I'm 17M and I have two younger sisters who are 14 and 12. My mom and her ex-husband shared custody of my half siblings but they only wanted to live with their dad. They never wanted a stepfamily and they sure as hell made sure they said it all the time. Between that and always saying they wanted to live with their dad, they hated my dad, they hated me and my sisters, we weren't a family, mom should never have gotten married again. I was never under any illusion that my half siblings actually loved me or that they were happy with us. They were like 13/15 when it got worse because they found out their dad had been dating someone after he and mom divorced and he broke up with the woman to get back together with mom but she chose my dad instead. That really pissed them off.

They always made a point of saying my sisters and I weren't their real siblings, that we had a different dad and that meant we weren't actual siblings. They said siblings share both parents and not just one. They were corrected that half siblings were still siblings and they said no. They had to keep coming here until they were 18. Mom wouldn't agree to let them live with their dad. They didn't get to have any influence when mom and her ex fought about custody in court and they even told me they would make our lives miserable for every day they had to come here.

I was so glad when my half brother turned 18 and he stopped coming. I don't think I can explain how much happiness it brought. I don't miss them. I'm not sad they're not here. Hell, after everything I don't give a fuck about them any more than they give a fuck about me. But my parents love them. Even my dad loves them and they can't say it more clearly how he's not ever going to be anything to them.

My parents told me after I said what I did, that we're still a family, and I should leave room for them to grow. And I shouldn't look at only the bad from before. I asked them to share any happy or positive memories of them being in my life. I said I would accept just one. They couldn't answer.

Obviously this was a shock to the entire friendship group especially given the short length of their relationship, the fact none of us have met her and the fact they’d be leaving in just over a month.

For context, our lives have been going in different directions for the last few years but contact has stayed somewhat consistent, however it’s really dropped off this year since he’s been with new GF. He’s had several relationships break-down over the last couple of years which I have supported him through, despite him making the same mistakes in every one. Irrelevant - he is very impulsive & I fear he’s making the same mistakes again (on a far larger scale) with this move, however we’re big boys & he’s free to make his own mistakes. 

Not long after the announcement of the move, best friend mentions a leaving party of sorts & invites us all. Some of us (me included) can’t make it, with it being such short notice. I had a prior engagement with my GF & her family which could not be rearranged. Best friend says he understands given its such short notice. I attempt to make plans to see him some other time before he leaves, whether that be just the two of us or others who weren’t able to attend. He then proceeds to tell the friendship group that we either attend the leaving party, or we don’t get to see him at all before he leaves.

I have tried so many times to arrange to see him on another date, all of which were met with claims of being far too busy to see me, or sometimes just flat out ignoring my messages. This was quite hurtful & majorly disappointing behaviour in my mind. I’m then informed of social media posts showint him at other social events with other people. The one that took the cake for me was the gym selfie bragging how he still had time to train despite “moving across the world in 2 weeks”. 

The leaving party was just over a week ago, I obviously did not feel good about missing it but I had no choice. I messaged him the following morning trying for the third or fourth time to arrange to see him before he leaves, offering any hour of the day to him. I still have not had a reply after over a week.

I placed a J and an 8, making it my turn again, said ‘Last card’ and then placed a K which is not a special card. then my family started calling me a cheater and barraging me because, since i placed 2 specials, the entire turn becomes special and therefore i must place another card. i disagreed because the 8 didn’t make it a continuation of my turn, it made it a seperatly turn of my own, therefore i didn’t place the specials in the same turn and that means that i win. I have autism and the fact that everyone was shouting at me made it hard to get my words out and i started crying and just stormed off. now i’m sitting in my room alone and i hear people saying that i ‘ruined game night’ and that i always argue and cheat for no reason. so AITA?

117,1ewqo85,AITA for my fashion sense? ,"So, I(23F) often visit my bf (23M) who works at a grocery store after work, to buy the groceries of the day, see him and catch a ride home on my days off. 

I wear a lot of mushroom themed clothing items, mushroom earrings, knit cardigans, bandanas, maxi skirts, knit socks, doc martens, etc…you know the type. Sometimes, I wear other styles of clothing. For example, I’ll wear striped stockings, a black maxi skirt, boots, an antique style pendant and an Edwardian blouse with my hair in a Gibson bun.

I do like dressing the way I want to dress. Now, my bf does not particularly like this. He doesn’t openly hate it most of the time, but he will sometimes just look at me like I’m weird, or give me that “look”. 

Last week, I was wearing a pink plaid dress, a pink cardigan, a red beret, white stockings, a pink purse and Mary Jane shoes. I got a few compliments on my outfit that day, and those made me feel confident.

I came down to visit him as usual and he looked at me extra long with that “look”. He kind of sighed, and told me that he wishes I dressed normally and said that I’m generally too much with my outfits.  He was openly irritated with me. 

This has been a repeated sentiment. He’ll ask me how I’m not boiling in so many layers, and make silly faces eyeballing my outfits. I try to laugh it off but it makes me feel bad. He’ll side eye me sometimes before I leave the house with him if I’m wearing something that seems too eccentric to him to be seen in public with me. 

Lately I’ve been dressing in graphic tees and jeans and he’s told me it’s so much better because he likes the naturalness/non high-effortness of it, but it’s got me a bit down to be honest.

118,1ewqgdq,AITA for getting drunk instead of babysitting my cousins?,"I (17F) am on holiday at a family reunion. Every year we rent out a big house as a whole family. We are currently in a rural town in Germany so the house is connected to feilds. 

So obviously you don’t want my cousins 3-13 to get lost. Ever since I was 12 I’ve been in charge of looking after my cousins in the night at family reunions because I’m the most responsible and all the adults get wasted so I’m in charge of keeping them safe. I had older cousins who were 13-17 but I was the most responsible. 

Usually there’s a tradition in my family that once you’re 17 you get to join the family in getting drunk. All my older cousins got the opportunity to. 

I’m now 17 so I assumed I’d be allowed to join the adults but no yesterday I was told not to drink by my family (not my parents but my extended family?). I wasn’t babysitting at the time and never agreed to babysit. So I took some anyway and got drunk on my own. Then my cousins come to be asking to play with me and I said go back to your parents together. They said they told them to come be with me I said I’m not well go back to them. So I go back with them. The family then see I’m drunk and get pissed off im drunk around their kids. (I was not acting in any erratic way and they have seen several drunk people before including my older cousins) 

This morning they were saying I neglected them and they could’ve ran off into the feilds and stuff. So today they have been keeping the kids away from me even though I’m sober now obviously but they are keeping me away from them and saying that my 14 year old sister and 13 year old cousin are now responsible for them because I can’t be trusted. But I come to find out that my 13 year old cousin has been GIVEN ALCOHOL. BY THOSE EXACT SAME FAMILY MEMBERS. Because my sister doesn’t drink so she can look after them for tonight. I feel like the whole family hate me but idk. Maybe I might be the asshole because I knew they usually make me babysit but got drunk anyway. Am I The Asshole? 

TL;DR I’m usually expected to babysit my cousins but wasn’t asked so just got drunk but it turned out I was expected to babysit.

119,1ewq87d,AITA for disregarding my dad’s advice after a scary situation? ,"I (22F) am working at the mall for the summer before I go to graduate school abroad. I have a week and a half left at the job and I mostly work alone. A little over a month ago, a guy came into my place of work. I wasn’t threatened, but the whole thing was really creepy. I called my dad to escort me to my car. 

My dad wanted me to file a police report, but I didn’t think the situation warranted it at the time. He got extremely mad at me. 

He came back to my place of work today. The interaction lasted maybe 5 minutes, but he made it clear he had been looking for me. My dad didn’t pick up the phone. I filed a report with mall security and had security escort me to my car. An hour later, as I am driving home, my dad returns my call. 

He tells me that I am not to return to my job—that I am going to quit with no notice and work as a clerk for his office. I told him that—while I am scared about this whole situation—I really don’t want to do that for a multitude of reasons—including the fact that I am in the running for a very well paying virtual position while in grad school.

He told me that it was unfair to him that I got to make this decision on my own. He then told me that there are going to be ground rules for when I am abroad because, since I won’t quit my job, I can’t be trusted—I must text him a password every 8 hours. I must answer every text/call from immediately (he’ll give me a 20-minute grace period for classes) and my ring tone should be loud enough that I can hear it no matter what I’m doing. I am not to travel alone.

I told him no. I will respond to his texts of course, but if I am sleeping or in the shower or out at a show, I can’t be expected to respond instantly. I told him I am an adult woman—not a teenager—and that having that many timed check-ins is not appropriate or realistic.

I might be the asshole for shooting down all of his ideas. I know it comes from a place of concern, and I probably should have filed a report sooner. But I also feel like I am being treated like a child when I am an adult. I am also upset that his concern is coming out as anger towards me rather than the situation. I feel like I am being punished for something that was done to me.

Me and my friend bought some food and were sitting down at the tables. Two people came over and sat next to us so we ended up talking to them for a while.

123,1ewpioz,AITA for being hard on my son because he doesn't want to go to church anymore?,"

I (45M) have always been deeply religious, and it's been important to me that my family shares those values. I’ve raised my son, Ben (19M), from my first marriage to respect our faith and attend church every Sunday. My current wife, Mary (42F), who is Ben’s stepmom, is very devout as well, and we've always made church a cornerstone of our family life.

Ben has always been a good kid, though in the past few years, he's developed his own style. He started dressing in all black, wearing heavy eyeliner, and listening to goth music. I didn’t love it, but I figured it was just a phase and didn’t interfere as long as he kept up with his responsibilities.

But recently, Ben came home from his first year of college and told us he doesn't want to go to church anymore. He said he’s been questioning his faith and feels like he needs to explore his beliefs in his own way. He even mentioned that church makes him feel uncomfortable now, like it’s more of a chore than a spiritual experience.

This didn’t sit well with Mary at all. She’s always been stricter with Ben than I have, and when he brought this up, she immediately laid down the law. She told him that as long as he’s living in our house, he has to go to church. Ben tried to explain his feelings, but Mary wasn’t having it. She accused him of being disrespectful and said that his new look and attitude were signs he was straying from the right path.

Things escalated when Mary told Ben that if he didn’t want to follow the rules of our house, he could find somewhere else to live. She said that his behavior was a bad influence on his younger step-siblings and that he was being selfish by rejecting the values we’ve tried to instill in him. Ben was visibly upset and just walked out of the room without saying another word.

Since then, things have been really tense. Ben has been distant, and I can tell he’s angry and hurt. He’s stopped talking about the church thing altogether, and I feel like there’s a wall between us now. I’m torn because, while I understand why Mary reacted the way she did, I also feel like maybe we pushed Ben too hard.

125,1ewpanf,AITA for blaming my friend and saying her mother has every right to ground her?,"This can be quite long, but please stay with me.
I (19f) have a best friend(18f) that I'm going to call A. A and I have been friends for about 8 years. She lost her father when she was 13 and now lives with her mother and brother. Her mother can be strict, but she's a nice woman. 
A changed her school about three years ago, and the kids there were more 'laid back', drinking, staying out late, not caring about school..
I didn't mind her new friend group at all, but after some time, I could see how they were affecting her. I didn't say anything at the time because I didn't think it was my place to do so.
Now, She's out until very late almost evey night. She has failed 8 of her subjects on her last report card and lied to her mother about it. Her mother cares about her a lot, but being a single parent, she's busy working, and she really trusts A, so she doesn't question her.
A few days ago, I received a call from A asking me to let her stay the night because she didn't want to go back home.
Unfortunately I couldn't as I wasn't even in the city. I told her she needed to go back, but she brushed me off.
Today, we spoke about it again, and she told me about how she got into an argument with her brother and left her house. She turned off her phone and didn't inform any family members where she was. Later, when she finally turned it on, she saw a lot of miscalls from her mother. Apparently, they also get into an argument after she calls her back, and that's when she called me. A ends up spending the night at a friend's house without informing anyone. Her mother had to work a late shift until 2 a.m., so she wasn't aware of it, and after she got home, she tried calling her, but A had her phone off again.
In the morning, when A got home, they got into another huge argument, and now she's grounded. (Her mother was up almost all night, calling her friends and trying to see where she was.)
A told me all of this in a group chat we had with another friend (20f, I'm calling her B). In response, I told her that her mother had every right to be angry with her. I went on to explain that everywhere in the world, young women could be in danger, and our parents have every right to be worried. It took less than 5 minutes to text or call her mother and inform her of what happened.
A went on to say that she was an adult and she had every right to do whatever she wanted, and B started backing her up.
I tried explaining to them why they were wrong, but they ganged up on me, saying that they don't need my opinion and I was being ridiculous. At some point, they began to ignore me, throwing insults, and making fun of me like I wasn't there. I called them childish and immature for not saying what they wanted to my face and left the group chat, but I'm well aware that they're talking about me behind my back. I don't think I'm in the wrong, but they got to me.
(By grounding, I mean that now she has to inform her mother wherever she goes. I said, grounding because she called it that)

129,1ewoqso,AITA for telling my roommate I don't want to renew the lease after he has been disrespectful ,"I (26F) moved into a new flat 3 months ago with my flatmate (26M). We knew for a month or two we were going to be moving. 

On the day the deposit was due, he said he didn't have the money and asked to borrow £500 (his part of the deposit) until he got paid. Baring in mind he earns more than I do, and he did not give me any warning. I was upset, but took the hit and paid the depsosit. He did not say thank you or sorry. He paid to have his bike fixed that same week and then he went on holiday that next week. He has been unreliable since then, having to chase him up to pay bills which he will pay and not responding to messages about important matters like flat inspections and rent for multiple days.


Since then he has been continuously disrespectful, some examples being that before I moved in (i moved in a week or two after him) he left a bin bag on the hallway carpet rather than taking it out. I ended up taking the bin bag out, and it had left a stain which he did not care about and I had to clean that up too. Another example is that I mopped then came home from work the next day to find that they had stomped berries into the floor without cleaning it up and they had taken things out of my cupboard without permission and returned it dirty. There are far more examples that I won't go into.

It is a 6 month lease, which I have said I don't want to renew with him and would rather if he leaves. Here is where I may be an asshole, I put all of the work into finding the flat. He has not lifted one finger, come to one viewing, searched one flat, etc. I would like to keep the flat, and for him to move out. I have let him know, with 3 months notice. The landlord may say no anyway and I have said at that point I will find a new place. I have a car (he does not) so the car parking space is handy and it is pet friendly which is hard to come by where I live, I also pay more rent for a room which is less than half the size of his because I have my pets here. He does not have any dependents. 

He is very angry with me for asking him to move out so soon. I was not unnecessarily mean or angry towards him, just calmly explained that I thought the situation was incompatible and that he should start looking for somewhere else to live.

I am friends with N since a whole year now, we met through the internet but eventually found out lived in the same country (Canada, it's not my home country but I had to moved in here some time ago because of family) So N, another friend of mine called A we all hangout very frequently. But these days N has been throwing shades at me for about no reason.

Yesterday N was insulting a favorite game of mine, comparing it with his favourite game since they are of the same genre and all that. I had politely asked him to stop insulting my fav game since I'm emotionally attached to the game as it helped me get over a very rough patch in my life. While I understand people can't like the same things as me, I'd atleast appreciate my close friends to understand that insulting something dear to me hurts in more ways than one.

So as I asked him to not insult the game, he said ""Why are you mad? Oh forgot you are Indian."" And this is where I snapped, I don't see why mentioning my nationality with a condescending time was necessary and when I scolded him, telling him how racist it felt to me, he just asked me why ik being moody. That's where I was done with N. Even in the past he has been very disrespectful of my home country, of my religion, of practically anything I like that includes celebrity crushes.

133,1ewo8ak,WIBTA for confronting my cousin when he called me out for not buying an iPad for my sister's gift? ,"I guess I'm just trying to understand why someone would do this and if it's an ok thing to do?

Context: 
We are at a celebration party for myself and my sister because of our excellent grades.

There are family relatives at our party. 

The person in question Is my cousin who is alot older than me. He is married and makes alot of money (£60,000+ salary).

Me and my sister are opening gifts given to us mainly by our parents and some other relatives.

I bought my sister an android tablet which is an android device for roughly £270, it's the same device I use myself. 

I should add that I wasn't initially planning on buying it for my sister but i had the option to add it as a bundle with my android phone so I thought I might as well.. 

I don't work and I am starting university next month, I have also been on vacation recently so it's not like I just had spare cash lying around. 

After the gifts have been given my cousin (despite not getting a gift for anyone himself) calls me out loudly Infront of everyone shouting ""why didn't you go all out and buy an iPad"".

He said this in a demeaning way meant to embarrass me Infront of everyone (what other explanation could there be??) 

I shook it off and laughed saying ""we are now team android"" 

But I can't help but ask myself why he would say that Infront of everyone? Infront of my sister when I have just given it to her? 

Is this a normal thing to do? These days I don't even clapback or confront this kind of stuff because I prefer to maintain good relations but stuff like this makes me think i should.  

I could have easily said what gift did you bring? Or something else.. 

I don't think my cousin hates me or anything or has something against me which is why I am confused at this kind of behaviour.

So WIBTA if I confront behaviour like this in the future or clapback? ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-20,"WIBTA for confronting my cousin when he called me out for not buying an iPad for my sister's gift?  I guess I'm just trying to understand why someone would do this and if it's an ok thing to do?

We are at a celebration party for myself and my sister because of our excellent grades.

There are family relatives at our party. 

The person in question Is my cousin who is alot older than me. He is married and makes alot of money (£60,000+ salary).

Me and my sister are opening gifts given to us mainly by our parents and some other relatives.

Due to this, it's made it difficult for her to walk without feeling pain. Also due to this, I've tried to be more helpful/available to help (carrying heavy bags, buying stuff from the store, etc.)

The day after we came back home, I just did my normal routine. But when she came back from work she got mad that I hadn't checked in with her to see if she was okay getting to work. She seemed upset that I had forgotten that she was injured.

In all honesty, it did slip my mind. I guess once we came back home, my mind just slipped back into doing what I normally do. And I can see how that can come off as not caring even though I don't personally empathize with it (for more context, I'm in an immigrant culture where prioritizing family is important).

But I don't really know what to do now about her being upset.

135,1ewo2jw,AITA for identifying differently?,"I was born and raised in another country but my family originally comes from another country. Growing up my family friends pretty much only consisted of people from that country of origin and the only time I communicated with people outside that group was with my school friends. I visited that country of Origin every year throughout my childhood and still have that country's citizenship. However, I never really identified with that country of origin due to factors such as:

* Not speaking the language fluently.
* Not agreeing with common viewpoints/values held in the country.
* Difference in religious beliefs of said country (I'm an atheist and in that country of origin atheism is a massive taboo with people being disowned for it).
* Never really connecting with that country's origins media/music and entertainment (Trust me I still try at times lol).

Because of that, I tend to identify as a person from the country I was born and raised in and never as someone from my country of origin. Some of my family members haven't fully accepted this, to say the least. In particular, one of my siblings, Who despite having a similar upbringing as me does not see eye to eye with me at all in the situation. My sibling seems to secretly hate the fact I don't have any connection to that country of origin and has lectured me on it quite a few times. In one instance, I was with them in a restaurant with my uncle and auntie and I started telling them about how I didn't identify as someone from my country of origin. She got angry with me later on about that conversation and lectured me about how I was harming my side of the family's image for it and how it would hurt my parents because I was simply flipping open about connecting with my roots. It wouldn't help that she was also a high-ranking member of that country's student association at her university as well. She also doesn't like the fact that I don't have an interest in taking up learning my language even though it wouldn't exactly benefit me much. Lastly, I never became a citizen of the country I was born and raised in (Citizenship policies are different there) which has led to the counter-argument of: This country won't accept you as one of them so you should identify with your roots as well (Which I feel is a stupid counter as I still spent my childhood in said country).

From all of this, I get the impression that my sibling seems to be implying that I'm an asshole for not being closer to my roots and someone causing a stain on my family name because of it. In my point of view, I feel this should not even be a topic for arguing as I'm not forcing my family or anyone else to identify differently and don't care how they identify and don't see why it's such a big deal considering my country of origin is highly populated as well.

137,1ewnu2f,AITA for telling my dad he doesn’t consider me family?,"I (40F) have always had a complicated relationship with my dad. My sister (38F) and I are from his marriage to my mom. They divorced when I was 4 and were both remarried by the time I was 9. My dad and stepmom had my brother (26M) a while later. 
Because it’s relevant, my stepdad came with my 2 older brothers (50M and 48M) and he and mom had my other brother (32M) a few years after they got married.
My childhood was spending weekends with my dad, who was very involved and unquestionably had me and my sister’s best interests at heart. 
On my mom and stepdad’s side, the blended family was of course not without hiccups but went great; in fact I just got back from a family reunion with them. It’s uncommon for all 7 of us to be in the same place at the same time since we grew up and scattered across the US, so we planned one. 
On my dad and stepmom’s side it was a different story. I’ll spare you all the details but at one point when my sister was about 16, my stepmom explained to her in no uncertain terms that she and I were not part of their family unit. And it showed. They would cancel plans with me to be with their friends, which I always thought was weird since I only came back to visit about every other year. In the fairly recent past, my dad said grace at Thanksgiving and named every family member (aunts, uncles, dead grandparents included) in his prayer but forgot my sister and I, who were awkwardly sitting at the very same table. 
Things completely blew up when my dad and stepmom called and wanted to come visit me for my 40th birthday. I was touched; they don’t often afford me that kind of attention and I’m literally 1000 miles away from them. I’ve had a rough year, on my last birthday I was transferred from a hospital to a nursing home for rehab because of nerve damage in my legs that means I have had to relearn how to walk, have chronic pain, and have to switch careers because I can’t be on my feet for very long. 
They cancelled 2 weeks before and wanted to reschedule, vaguely citing my dad’s health (which granted, is fragile with a poorly understood autoimmune disorder and has landed him in the ICU more than once) and a packed weekend of birthday parties with their friends.
Ngl, I lost my shit. I asked them if they were aware of the message they were sending by rescheduling my birthday to celebrate someone else’s, and pointed out that they do this frequently. They claim to have had no idea they were doing this, though my sister feels the same way and has brought it up with them before. 
The only conclusion I can come to is that if they really didn’t know they were doing it, that means it came naturally, and therefore they were dead serious about not considering me family. 
I’m hurt, I’m angry, and I don’t see the point of trying to mend a relationship that is so fundamentally absent. 
They just keep saying “I hope we can get past this someday” to which I say “get past what? Reality?”

I'm privileged - I was able to attend college, get a degree, and come out with no debt. I did a few internships in college, but never really thought I would make much money. After I started college,  I was the child my parents didn't worry about much.

At a family event on mom's side, a different family member was grilling a cousin about what they wanted to study in college. The topic of other career fields came up and I spoke to my experience about being in the tech industry and how I didn't expect to make 6-figures at my first job out of college.

Two weeks later, I'm on the phone with my dad asking him about something else and towards the end of the conversation, he brings this up. He tells me that I upset some of the family when I spoke about my job and when I asked him for details on who I offended and how, all I got was a metaphor about ""stones on your bridge"" (mean to be similar to ""don't burn bridges"" metaphor).

I asked my mom if I had offended her or if other family members and she mentioned she hadn't heard anything. If family members were upset, she would have been one of the first people told since it was her side of the family.  Mom's best guess? My dad was the one I upset.

Unless my dad can tell me how I attacked or minimized others, I don't feel I owe him an apology.

I want to help her and proposed a different option of her coming to work under my partners business, 9-5 M-F and I'll provide free childcare + he'd pay her for working under us because she'd help our business and I can eat off the back end without tripping.

I have multiple appointments this week plus I'm 32 weeks pregnant so 12 hour days are tiring me out.

141,1ewn9o4,AITA for not texting my GF back when I have been feeling sick all day?,"GF & I have been together since April. Things started really well, but we started spending a ton of time together. Like she would spend the night every night, but I honestly enjoyed spending time with her.

After a month or so I felt like I wasn't getting my own space and she would become very insecure (accuse me of talking to other girls, cheating). 100% transparency, I was not talking to any other girls as I have failed in all my relationships, and I wanted to give 100% in this one. So naturally being accused of something when I have done nothing wrong was beginning to turn me off. One thing I did do wrong, was after about 3 months when we would argue, I would raise my voice and yell, because despite me being honest with her, it felt like she didn't understand me, and I was always in the wrong.

One day after we had a talk about our relationship and our goals for the relationship, she came over gave me my key and said she was done. I let her go, but we met up the next day and talked about it. She even gave me her notebook to read her boundaries and insecurities, and I actually took the time to sit down, read it, and write my notes on her notebook. So we agreed we would take things slowly this time and truly get to know each other.

Fast forward to yesterday. I felt terribly ill and didn't want to talk to anyone. She mentioned in the past texting was big to her (let's be honest, a lot of people feel the need to text) but texting is whatever to me. I'm more of a lets hangout in person and talk kinda guy. But anyways she texted me, and I replied & we went back and forth, but her last text I didn't reply to. Figured i'd just talk to her when she gets off work, not a big deal. So hours go by and i'm just dying in my bed the whole day. She calls me, crying saying she was worried about me because I didn't text back and that she felt like I ghosted her (even though I have never ghosted her or disappeared for long periods from her in the past ) & It felt like she didn't care how I felt, and solely was just feeling anxious. So I say I don't know what to say, because I have been home sick all day and if she was really that worried she could have texted or called. She got angry saying she's not going to text again because she already did. So now I'm getting angry because I feel like it doesn't matter how I feel, I'm obligated to reply. So she once again says she's done and that I need to stay single and to leave her the F\*CK alone. So I said, ""you're acting like a psycho"" and she hung-up on me. AITA???

142,1ewn6hm,AITAH for no longer pulling my brothers weight,"(Sorry for the long post. I wanted to give a lot of context for this.)

I’m a 23f and my brother is 18. I still live at home while I get my degree and work. I am the oldest of our 3 siblings, our other sister just moved away for college, so I end up doing a lot of the bigger picture cleaning around the house. Like cleaning out vents, cleaning out clogged piping, sweeping, mopping, cleaning out the fridge(because everyone leaves their left overs in the fridge until I clean them out) cleaning out the pantry(the same happens in the pantry). I wash all the blankets/pillows/rugs, majority of the time i clean our bathroom. 

Now that my sister is gone we are going to have to spilt her half of the chores, which were washing half the dishes and washing towels. I washed the towels for this week and washed my sisters half of the dishes because my brother had worked a lot this weekend( He works two days a week and every other weekend). so I thought I’d take on that part for this week. 

My brothers only chores are to take out the trash and wash half of the dishes. His half of the dishes have been sitting in the sink since sometime early last week. It is a running theme that my brother will push off washing the dishes for a week or a week and a half, causing the whole house to smell. He also doesn’t take the trash out often either. I would say the trash is full at least once a day and he only takes it out maybe once or twice a week(the other times it’s me or my step father) at one time he was helping wash the towels but stopped because he “washes his own” meaning he throws 2 in with his clothes to wash and then uses the towels I washed when he runs out. 

I have spoken to my mother about how it really stresses me out that he isn’t pulling his weight. I don’t mind doing the things I already do because that makes up for me not paying rent while in school but I would like for him to at least wash the dishes when the sink is full. I have been met with “well when I want something done I just do it myself” and “You should really figure out how to cope with things like this.” And “He washes his own towels anyways”

I have also talked with my brother on many occasions pleading with him to help me because I can’t do school, work and clean the whole house in my own. I am met with “yeah whatever” and eyes rolls as he ignores me. Tonight was the same with me begging him to help me and him just rolling his eyes. I will admit I got upset and slammed his door because he was just staring at me rolling his eyes. 

I freshly washed the towels today. I just took them all to my room. This is what he does with his 2 towels if he washes them. I don’t believe he has any towels washed at the moment and won’t have one clean tomorrow.

143,1ewmy9p,AITA for wanting more photos of me from my school production?,"I am a senior in High School and was recently in my final High School production. The show has a pretty ensemble cast, but everyone (including the director) agreed that there were only really 5 characters who mattered to the plot. I was lucky enough to be cast as one of them. I was in both acts, but my part was almost entirely in the second half of the first act. Within this chunk I was in two large scenes, Three songs as a soloist (two of which I led for the majority of the songs) and two other songs as part of a featured ensemble group (still as the character). In the second act, however, I was in three scenes for very small portions of time, largely in the background with a line here or there (essentially ensemble).

This week, we got the photos back (in the form of a $25 dollar photo book) and I found out I was only in 9 of the 80+ photos. Turns out the photographer had conveniently left for the exact half an hour my character spent on stage in the first act and there is no photo record of it happening at all. In most of the photos that actually feature me I am in the background (one has my back in it) and only two actually have me as a subject of the photo. The other four main characters had at least 20 photos with them in it for reference. This error doesn't just affect me though, there is also a group of the ensemble who only appear when I do (in fact they appear less in the second act than I do), so these people have also been screwed over. 

I don’t feel that I am more important than the other cast members, but this was something I’d been looking forward to since before I started attending the school five years ago. Professional photos have always been my favourite form of memorabilia as I enjoy seeing facial expressions and specific moments as well as them being a cool keepsake. I also planned on using the photos for my resume as they would have been pretty cool and now I have nothing I could use. These productions are my livelihood and I tend to get a little depressed when they end, so these photos would also help with that. 

As I mentioned I was a little upset when I found out, so I said one or two throwaway comments that were something along the lines of ""damn they missed all of my scenes?"" and “where’d he go for so long?” I tried to be very light-hearted about it and not at all accusatory, but several friends and the teacher who directed told me to calm down and that I was being dramatic as there were still photos of me.

Previous productions have never had this happen (I know this as I have been in some of them, but never a lead role) and they even recorded them for cast members to see (which also didn't happen for whatever reason this year). My teacher was under a lot of stress and I don't blame him for it. I also understand that there is nothing I can do to change that this happened, but I feel I still have the right to be a little upset.

144,1ewmvwa,AITA for canceling my family x-mas trip ,"the past 8 years, my mom & her hubs have driven 6-7 hrs with their RV to visit us before Christmas, they see me, hubs & 3 kids plus my step sister & her son. They stay for 2-3 days at a RV park (not a campground) about 1.5 hours from our house. They rent the “clubhouse” actually the employee break room that they still use while rented.  we’re not allowed to stay in their 6-bed RV, and tents aren’t permitted at the park. So We visit for a day, and they usually come to our apartment the next.

Last year, after the clubhouse rental, we left because it was raining & they wouldn’t let us stay in the RV. The next day, I asked if they’d visit as usual, but my mom avoided answering until almost 3 PM, leaving the kids wondering all day. She said they were thinking of leaving early the next morning like 3am. I tried  to get them to come for dinner and games but she ghosted me until they left around 7 AM.
That entire situation made me disappointed. I feel like with each trip it seems more like a just get it over with trip. 

for the last three years, I’ve suggested we go to a real campground for a better experience for the kids, hiking trails, a lake something more than a parking lot with a park. I told my husband after last years trip that it was the last time I’d go to the RV lot. I’ve offered to pay for camping spots, pick closer spots to them but it all falls on deaf ears. 
So this  year, my mom asked for campground suggestion but ended up finding one herself that was perfect—activities for the kids, grass, trees, trails, and rock climbing. Excited, I agreed to camp there and said “we will camp anywhere like this”

But then, she texted me the next day saying, “This is where we decided to pick, let me know if I should rent you a tent spot.” I saw the campground name and quickly agreed, thinking it was the same one she’d found. But when I checked the map, I realized she had booked a different campground ran by the same organization hence the confusion—it’s a dirt parking lot in the desert, four hours away, with no trees, no trails, no activities, and a prison nearby. When I confronted her, that maybe she booked the wrong site she claimed it was the right one and sent a picture of the receipt with a “you’re welcome.”
she went on and offered to find another spot an hour further away. This area isn’t even known for camping; it’s in a dead town between our 2 states known for  bad  weather, I don’t want to get rained out in a tent while we’re not allowed in her RV. 

I feel like she bait and switched me. She sent a zoomed in picture of the map so I couldn’t see the name of the campground, no heads up she switched the location,Just booked and this is where we decided and it’s nowhere like what we discussed. When I continued to say it wasnt what I agreed to she said, “You told me you’d camp anywhere,” listing reasons why she HAD to pick that one.

I’ve ghosted her since. 
Am I  asshole for canceling this trip?

ETA: 
Reasons she had to pick the spot: 
With her weight and age it’s hard for her to travel more than hour, she has to stop for 20-30 min cause of her “traveling anxiety” she is over weight but not obese, she still walks her dog and works. 
Place she booked is 5 hours away from her vs 8 hours at original place 

The club house rental was more than $500 or not available; she didn’t explain which it was. 

She wants to bring my step brothers baby (2 years old); doesn’t know how the well the baby will do traveling long hours but hasn’t even told my step brothers her plan to take his baby.

She'll typically stay up really late each night and get herself all worked up. (I have made her mom and our school aware of these tendencies). I would stay up with her and talk with her through text or over FaceTime. I tried all kinds of thing to distract her and I found the thing that would distract her the most is me complimenting her. I'd call her cute and compliment her personality. After awhile it became clear she had feelings for me. I tried my hardest to ignore it, mostly for selfish reasons. I saw her as a really good friend and if she saw me just as a crush then once it's gone she's going to forget about me. It was an inner debate, have her be hurt physically or be hurt mentally and then get over it. I chose the latter.

Because of so I tried to do things to set the record that I'm straight, which would usually get pushed back against. It was mostly our other friend (F14), let's call her Jasmine, who would egg her on. Jasmine would make jokes about how we should date and I would respond that I'm straight. She'd laugh and say things along the lines of 'There's no way that you're straight', and Jane would laugh along with her. It did get to a point where I started questioning my own sexuality, being repeatedly told that. I would do things like try to have boy talk but they would quickly switch it to talking about how hot girls are (They're both bisexual). I would personally tell Jasmine about a guy I was talking to, knowing the news would eventually make its way to Jane and once it did she'd get mad and snippy with me. 

Eventually she did confess her feelings for me over FaceTime and I said I didn't like her in that way. She got mad and started cursing at me and hung up. I sent her a huge paragraph apologizing and after an hour or so she replied back it's okay, but it's obvious she's still pissed.

I would do things like try to have boy talk but they would quickly switch it to talking about how hot girls are (They're both bisexual). I would personally tell Jasmine about a guy I was talking to, knowing the news would eventually make its way to Jane and once it did she'd get mad and snippy with me. 

Eventually she did confess her feelings for me over FaceTime and I said I didn't like her in that way. She got mad and started cursing at me and hung up. I sent her a huge paragraph apologizing and after an hour or so she replied back it's okay, but it's obvious she's still pissed. 

AITA? I thought I made it pretty clear I wasn't interested in her, but I did give her constant compliments. ",,0.08758482336997986,0,0
147,1ewmf0r,AITA for telling my husband he needs to confront his mother?,"I need to know if I'm the a-hole here. Yesterday we had my in-laws over for some family time. MIL brought dinner and brownies for dessert. I (F39) have 4 daughters 19 (Livy), almost 4 (Charlotte), 2 (Rose) and an infant (Sadie). Most of us were eating in the living room except my MIL and Charlotte (MIL's very obvious favorite). Charlotte is very silly. She was joking with MIL saying she was going to eat 1 brownie; no, 2 brownies; actually 3 brownies. MIL responded ""you can't do that, you're going to get fat!"" Immediately Livy looked at me, mouth gaping open and eyes wide like ""did you just hear that?"" I was so frustrated because she's still a toddler, she's rail thin and we struggle to put weight on her, we don't say things like that to anyone and I grew up with a very negative body image and disordered eating. 

I messaged my husband what she said and asked him to address it because I was way too upset in that moment. I said ""well girls, it's bedtime"" then I grabbed both of my toddlers and hauled them up to bed, hoping my husband would say something because it was wildly inappropriate. When I came down, they were gone and husband said he didn't address it because he didn't hear it. So he doesn't know what to say. Both my teenager and I explained exactly what was said and why it was so upsetting. I wanted it done right away because MIL has a history of saying shitty things and acting like she didn't mean it the way it was taken or pretending she never said it at all. Out of her 3 daughters in-law, I'm the only one that has any semblance of a relationship with her. Husband knows this, so when I bring up something against her, he takes it personally because he wants me to like her. He also knows I don't not like her, like my SILs. Husband also knows I try to keep the peace and am not comfortable confronting his mother because I can be more emotional than him. Also, if it were my own mother, I would have spoken directly to her because I'm more comfortable with her, but she would never say something like that to my kids. 

Husband thinks I'm the AH because he thinks I'm looking for a reason to not like his mom or that I should have just confronted her myself because I was upset about it. He does agree that it was very wrong and says he will bring it up next time he talks to her. But AITA here?

ETA: Husband was there, he just wasn't paying attention to her. He just thinks if I had a problem with it, I should have been the one to say it, not him. I was just too upset in that moment to be the one to say it. Normally I do address things with her, but she tends to ignore it. I also figured she'd take it more seriously coming from her son. 

ETA: additional context, MIL is always commenting on what people eat or letting people know she deprives herself in an attempt to stay thin. Our state fair is known for its food. She was asking SIL if she attends the fair and why. SIL replied ""we go to enjoy the food and see the sights"". MIL replied ""oh I don't enjoy eating"".

148,1ewm7dg,AITA for what I told my brother,"To start, the problem began when I (27F) was early in college. Around 7-9 years ago, but I can't remember exactly. My brother (now 24M) was in high school and him and his friends gambled. Well my brother ended up getting into debt (about a few thousand dollars at the time). We were very close at the time, and he confided in me about the situation. I did not know what to do, so I told my parents about the situation. They bailed him out of his debt, which I told them would be a mistake because his addiction would come back even worse. My brother also knew I told them since I was the only person he told, which strained our relationship immensely to the point that I felt I had lost my brother for a number of years. 

It is now present day (August 2024). In the time frame, I went $60,000 into debt. My parents gave me money through my mother and my fathers retirement to help me get out of debt, but part of getting me to that much debt was because I took out a $15,000 bank loan that I had to pay back. My younger brother has also been gambling again, but this time it has gotten much worse. He has borrowed thousands of dollars from my parents, asked the girl he is with for money, borrowed over $10,000 from his friends, and also asked me for money. I have not given it to him every time, but I have given him $500 periodically because I feel that if my parents keep giving him money, I need to because I am scared that if I don't I will lose my relationship with my brother (I have told my parents this). At one point my brother also asked me how to take out the $15,000 bank loan that I did, to which I told him how to do it. 

My brother has gone even farther into debt and is close to losing his job, being evicted, and is pressuring my mom for more money. My mom is crying and in tears, while my dad is telling me about the situation. I called my older brother to tell him about the situation, and he throws out some ideas on what to do. I tell my older brother that I think the only way my younger brother will realize he has a problem is if he reaches rock bottom, which has been when I've made my significant life changes to better myself. My brother challenges this and says my younger brother is already there, but we also shouldn't help him get there by helping him get a $15,000 loan. I told him that I didn't help my younger brother get the loan, I just told him how I got it, which is information that my younger brother could also find online if he wanted to. I then told my older brother that he should not be criticizing me because that is not why I called. I then told him that maybe the only reason my younger brother has never gone to my older brother and only gone to me and my parents for money is for a reason and I told my older brother he should think about that. I then was so angry I just hung up the phone without letting my older brother say anything else because of how hurt I was. AITA

149,1ewm71g,AITA Advice for keeping or getting rid of a friend,"AITA for feeling abandoned by a friend who is currently living in my house (renting a room) 
Ok so me and my friend have been friends for three years and has basically was like a sister to me. 
She had been there from 2021- now and I lost a lot of family members during that time and she was so loveing and compassionate I was very hesitant to be her friend because she’s a beautiful blonde who is kinda like a popular girl. In the past year she had a break up with her previous bf because she emotionally cheated on him with another guy so he broke up with her. Then the next day she gets with this new guy. 
Mind you he’s psycho 
He has abused her in every what possible it’s the classic DV situation and me being a forensics student didnt want to find my friend dead. I was always to the rescue helping when ever she called. However she told him where we lived which i made a clear boundary between us when she moved in saying he’ll never find out but he started picking her up from my house (yes i know i can’t control it unless i get a restraining order). But I was hurt but I still helped for a year right before their one year aniversary he breaks her property and tries to not let her get to her car by blocking her (lawful kidnapping) and she calls me crying and saying she’s done wanting to finally get the police involved. So we did, and I mind you am stressed the hell out. I’m somone who put friends first because that’s kinda how I show love. So we did I helped call the cops I had all the information on him she needed plate full name adress residence ect. (Creepy ik but i care a bit to much incase she went missing) 
So that was put in place. I was her Sponsor to try and keep her away for as much as I could, turns out after 4 weeks she started seeing him in secret and I eventually found out when I cought him on my ring camera. I felt betrayed and scared. He’s very physical and will do sketchy shit. I told her I couldn’t take anymore after this but I still want to be her friend. After a year of trying I had to eventually put myself first. I was missing college and work to save her and lossjng a lot of sleep. But I told her beside him I’ll be there for her. I offered to go to luch, dinner, road trips, just talking and she’s constantly is denying me. 
(She’s also miserable to live with cuz she’s a slob and makes the house full of tension with me so trying to have a happy house hold and try and be supportive when she’s ignoring me and just treating me like a landlord it pissed me off) I don’t rent to anyone and I don’t like living with people but the whole reason I had her move in was to save her from her other ex, and because she’s a friend. she has constantly told me before “nothing will ever break us apart” “ I know others have hurt you but that’s not me”
“Just because I’m a Gemini doesn’t mean I’m going to switch on you” (she believes in star stuff so she says stuff like that I’m a Virgo) 
So like I feel hurt. After all the years we’ve been through and everything I’ve helped her with she tosses me out like that. I mean that guy threated to kill me my dog and my fiancée. 
I care for her deeply and I’m hurt. Ive met her family and we’ve seen a lot of the world together. I helped her with her college trade school and everything. 
I helped her if she needed food or anything i basically was under her thumb but I knew that’s what friends were supposed to do. But she’s been giveing me the cold shoulder. She does this thing where her eyes glaze over when she talks to me like I’m a horrible person for not wanting him and her together. But it’s not even that it’s the fact she involved him in my life on a personal legal level. I even had him trespassed which I forgot to mention previously. Which neither of them followed he would stay in the side walk just to get a rise out of me. 
I just want my friend back and I want her out of harms way. 

Trust me I’ve also tried convincing her to do therapy or even just me talking to her and what not knowing she deserves someone better, but it goes in one ear and out the other. 

Now she won’t even talk to me because as she texted me “she has no emotional availability for anyone extra in her life at all”
But her being off and on with him doesn’t count I guess. 
So I kinda just have to walk on eggshells in my own home with the shell of a girl who was my best friend 

My fiancée said I need to just focus on our relationship our dog and college and just put myself first for once and let her ride out here lease. 
So I figured I’d ask people on the interwebs their thoughts 
But I guess I kinda also just realized she’s always put men first

I sent the message about 2 minutes ago telling him that he is no longer able to stay with me. I said it is not negotiable and then I blocked him on everything without even waiting for his reply.

Maybe later I will give you a little more backstory now that my head is clearer. The anxiety is still there and I have an emotional hangover, but I feel much better. 

AITA if I back out of letting someone move in my house to rent a room because they keep saying and doing things that make me uncomfortable? I have a friend who is in a bad living situation. I am a female and I have a 3 bedroom house. My friend is a guy, and that is all I see him as. He asked me several weeks ago if he could rent my couch from me and I told him no. I thought about it for a while and then on Friday I told him maybe we could do a trial run.

 Now he thinks he's going to be staying here permanently and is trying to tell me what is going to happen with certain things. 

Then earlier today he told me he loves me with a kissy face. It's not the first time he's sent me one either. I just don't see him like that. I got a divorce last year and have been alone since and have come to value my peace. I'm not interested in a relationship at all and I am in therapy for things that happened in the past. My mother also says it is a bad idea.

 For some background, I am in my 40s, but I am on the autism spectrum. I tend to be a people pleaser and get taken advantage of quite a bit. I have been working on boundaries, though. 

Anyway, I have made it perfectly clear that I am not interested in him as more than a friend, but he keeps insisting that he likes me and I will eventually feel the same way. I told him to be honest I don't ever want to be in another relationship again. 

I know I told him ok, but wibta if I changed my mind since he makes me uncomfortable? I've known him for almost a year but we've only met and hung out in person twice.
 he's also saying that he would like to share my bed instead of sleeping on the couch. It just doesn't feel right. How should I tell him I don't want him to move into my house?

Then earlier today he told me he loves me with a kissy face. It's not the first time he's sent me one either. I just don't see him like that. I got a divorce last year and have been alone since and have come to value my peace. I'm not interested in a relationship at all and I am in therapy for things that happened in the past. My mother also says it is a bad idea.

 For some background, I am in my 40s, but I am on the autism spectrum. I tend to be a people pleaser and get taken advantage of quite a bit. I have been working on boundaries, though. 

Anyway, I have made it perfectly clear that I am not interested in him as more than a friend, but he keeps insisting that he likes me and I will eventually feel the same way. I told him to be honest I don't ever want to be in another relationship again. 

I know I told him ok, but wibta if I changed my mind since he makes me uncomfortable? I've known him for almost a year but we've only met and hung out in person twice.
 he's also saying that he would like to share my bed instead of sleeping on the couch. It just doesn't feel right. How should I tell him I don't want him to move into my house? He's really pushing to move in on Wednesday (today is Monday). ",0.0,0.07375006377696991,0,1

156,1ewkq3g,AITA for giving financial help to one friend but not the other?,"I (28M) have two friends who I met online. I live in America and they live in the same foreign country but don't know each other.

I met my first friend, ""Steve"" (30M), in 2022. This past March, Steve told me that his mother required heart surgery. He doesn't make very much money and asked me if I was able to send him some money through Western Union. Since I'd known him for over two years and considered him a good friend, I sent him a total of $3,000 USD over the past five months.

I met my second friend, ""Joe"" (40M) in April of this year. He and I became very close very quickly. When we had met, he had recently lost his job because his boss ordered him to purchase a device for work. This device was only able to be purchased on Amazon and shipped into his country because it's not manufactured in his country. He couldn't purchase it because he doesn't own a credit card and doesn't have that much money. He asked me during the first week of our friendship if I was able to purchase it for him and he'd pay me back after he started working again. I declined because at that point, I hardly knew him and the device costs $1,500 USD. Instead, I sent him $300 USD.

Two weeks ago, I was speaking to Joe and told him about Steve and how I had helped him with his mother's operation. He became extremely angry and hung up on me. He later sent me a voice message stating ""I'm very upset that you declined to purchase the device I needed for work meanwhile you helped this other guy 10x more than you ever helped me.""

I responded: ""Well, I've known him for close to three years and you for only three months. Also, I sent you $300 within a week of knowing you.""

He stated that he was offended that I was measuring our friendship based on length and not on ""closeness"" and decided to end our friendship. He blocked me on every social media platform.

160,1ewjdwg,AITA for telling my girlfriend she should wash her stuffed animal?,"So I (M/30) recently got into a disagreement with my girlfriend (F/24) over a stuffed animal she keeps while she sleeps. I’ll clear up right away that I have no issue with the fact that she sleeps with one and I personally have many stuffed toys from otaku hobbies (fumos and stuff) but that I have never regularly had a stuffed animal or comfort object that I sleep with, so my perspective is definitely skewed compared to hers (or people that regularly use a comfort object to sleep).

The issue arose from a conversation we had via text earlier today; she’s been sick during our travels recently and I’ve just been trying to go down the checklist of things that can help her get better faster, taking medicine regularly and drinking lots of fluids, bedrest and such. One thing I’ve noted is she sleeps with the same stuffed animal every night that she brought with us on our travels; we’ve only been together and sharing a bed for about a month so this is also relatively new to me, but according to her it’s a stuffed animal that’s likely never been washed and she’s had it since her childhood; so maybe going on 15+ years of something that she’s never washed. The appearance of it is what you’d expect, somewhat grimy and brown, I’m trying to remain neutral in my wording so I wouldn’t exactly call it “filthy” but it’s definitely been well loved over the years. 

My argument or perspective was such: I think that the stuffed animal could be getting her sick more often, and especially during times like right now it should be common sense to hand wash it and let it dry without putting it in a drier (or just however according to Google says to wash it so it doesn’t get ruined), as to avoid letting it become a host of germs / sickness inducing dust or mites. To this point I was met with pushback from her saying “Literally nobody has ever gotten sick from an unwashed stuffed animal” and that “My mom is a nurse and if the stuffed animal was an actual issue she would have done something about it”. She got very offended by the mere suggestion that her stuffed animal could be at all unhygienic. I was trying to avoid starting a fight over this but I simply couldn’t (still cannot) see the reasoning as to why she doesn’t want to wash it, other than an attachment to the “smell of home” it probably carries. At the moment she’s gone back to sleep to rest more from the sickness but we’ve left the disagreement on hold in that probably anything I say further is just going to agitate her but I still don’t feel like I’ve said anything in the wrong.

A group of 6 friends and I recently went on a trip together to attend a 4 day event.  The event was kind of in the middle of nowhere so there were any nearby hotels.  My friend Keisha booked an Airbnb for everyone, and the plan was that we’d all Venmo her for 1/7 of the price.   The place seemed great except it did not provide towels, so some people were stressed about bringing their own due to limited space in the cars.  We all had to work the day before the first day of the event so we’d be arriving late at night.

In the week leading up to the stay, there was some drama about how was sleeping were within the AirBnb.  I got moved out of the room I was expecting to be in.  I wanted to know what to expect in the new space I was to sleep in.  I therefore clicked on the link Keisha had previously sent me to view the listing.  The link did not work and instead brought me to a page that said the listing had been deleted.  Keisha was very stressed and busy with work and had told people not to bother her leading up to our departure.  I therefore did not immediately reach out to her about this.

I know ppl who’ve been scammed on Airbnb and arrived at their destination to find they have nowhere to stay.  I was concerned that we had been scammed.  It would be bad for us to arrive in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night and have nowhere to stay.  On Airbnb and VRBO, I searched the area where our place should have been.  The place we were expecting to stay was listed as available for the dates we had already paid to stay there.  The listing also said there would be towels in the home for us to use.

Again, I had been told that Keisha was very stressed and did not have time to talk to anyone.   I reached out to the host of the listing to try to see whether they had been aware of the other listing we’d responded to that was now deleted.  They said they still had our reservation and those dates were listed as available in error.  They made a new listing because of some upgrades to the place including the towels.

I was unsure if I should mention any of this to the group.  Since ppl had been stressed about fitting towels into the cars with all the luggage etc, I decided to mention it.  I was told that I’m an asshole for reaching out to the host instead of letting Keisha know about the issue.  I explained that I was trying to spare her the extra stress.  Keisha is mad at me for not trusting, and 5 of the other 6 people in the group say what I did was wrong.  I don’t get it.  I thought I was helping the group out.

Again, I had been told that Keisha was very stressed and did not have time to talk to anyone.   I reached out to the host of the listing to try to see whether they had been aware of the other listing we’d responded to that was now deleted.  They said they still had our reservation and those dates were listed as available in error.  They made a new listing because of some upgrades to the place including the towels.

I was unsure if I should mention any of this to the group.  Since ppl had been stressed about fitting towels into the cars with all the luggage etc, I decided to mention it.  I was told that I’m an asshole for reaching out to the host instead of letting Keisha know about the issue.  I explained that I was trying to spare her the extra stress.  Keisha is mad at me for not trusting, and 5 of the other 6 people in the group say what I did was wrong.  I don’t get it.  I thought I was helping the group out.

162,1ewiyo3,AITA for supporting my daughter's sports preference against her mom's opinion?,"I just had a fight with my ex-wife, who I unfortunately still live with until we sell our house, over sports. Our daughter is 12 very soon, she's 5'2 and skinny and entering 6th grade. She has celiacs, so diet and nutrition are a concern and we've been working for a couple years to get her weight up and she actually had an appointment today with her GI and they were really happy with her weight gain and said she doesn't need to be seen every 6 months anymore. But she is a healthy, tall, beautiful, amazing kid and she plays rough.

This evening we were talking to her about picking sports. She's been playing girls soccer off and on through different recs for a few years but she's not great at it and she wanted to try something new. She was interested immediately in girls volleyball because her PE teacher had told her she was good at it and we also both think she would be fantastic at it. However she asked what crosscountry was and when I explained it she was really interested in that and wanted to do that. My ex immediately became adamant that she could not do CC. She said that CC requires a specific diet and because my daughter is a picky eater and already has celiacs she was afraid it would be bad for her health because she wouldn't keep up with the carbs and that it was bad for her joints. This upset my daughter because she is very sensitive about the things that she is prevented from doing because of her celiacs and started crying. Then my ex brought up that running and high impact running can affect periods and that my daughter is showing signs of starting her period soon and she doesn't want that to be rough for her or be delayed because of running. I had a really hard time understanding the logic of this. Despite this and trying to keep the peace I tried to help my daughter come around by suggesting that I think she would be really great at VB and she's also interested in VB so maybe she should just do that, and try track in the spring instead. That pissed off my ex again saying that no she feels very strongly that it wouldn't be good for her health to be in a running sport and then of them kept arguing. She said you can play soccer or volleyball or whatever but I don't want you doing cross country or track. I made the comment ""you know a soccer player on average runs more than 2 miles in a game, same as CC"". She flipped out and yelled about me trying to get my way and stormed out. I went and talked to her and we argued. I told her she was being manipulative and hurting our dhtrs feelings by bringing up celiacs and that it was completely illogical that she couldn't do CC if she could do the other sports and that other girls can play all these sports. She was upset and crying and wanted me to leave so I left.

My parents do not ask her for money and in fact have told her they don't want her money. They just want a safe place for the child to call home.

I don't talk to my cousin anymore because she's a narcissist that likes to make me feel like crap but she sucks up to my siblings. Also, I don't like that she is using her child as a meal ticket for a roof over her head.

165,1ewhwee,AITA for wanting my partner to contribute more to our household rather than blow his money on an expensive trip for himself?,"Several months ago my partner moved across the country to live with me after years of maintaining a long distance relationship. He makes far less money than I do, so I recognized that I would need to shoulder the majority of the financial responsibility - house, food, utilities, etc., and that he would contribute what he could. He already owed me money from the long distance years and I've rarely brought it up. Since living together, household costs have gone up three or four times more than I was paying before - far more than I originally thought we would be spending when he moved here; and I also pay for the majority of the food for both of our dogs, so dog expenses have doubled as well. It is now to the point that I have wracked up a fair amount of credit card debt to compensate for the additional costs, of which he is aware. He consumes a lot more electricity (leaves lights on, etc.) and eats at least three times as much as I do, to the point that when I go to make breakfast or lunch, the food is gone and I have to dine out or pick up even more groceries. He always seems to have money for booze, vapes and fast food when he's on his way home from his part-time job, but is unable to commit to a monthly amount to contribute to bills, etc. When I have brought up the idea of a regular monthly household contribution, or cost cutting measures such as turning out the lights when not in a room or leaving me half of whatever food may be in the fridge rather than finishing it all off (leftovers, for example), he gets upset and it almost always results in some sort of argument.   
So here's the thing - he has recently discovered that he is going to be getting a considerable tax return and has started to plan to use the money on a vacation for himself, without me. While I recognize that he should be able to treat himself to something fun or nice, I also feel that he should be at least offering to pay me back for a portion of the debt I've incurred these past few months. However, he hasn't offered to do so and doesn't seem to understand why I don't like the idea of him choosing to blow the majority of his tax refund on a trip when our household costs are so high and he is in debt (both to me and to others).

I took two AP tests at the end of May this year and got high scores, so I received $200. I don't really spend money unless I really want something, so I've saved it up.

Neither of my parents have real jobs, but they would do different food deliveries for money; well we don't have a car anymore so imagine how that works. Before my mom lost her job, she gave me a card and every 2 weeks would put $15 on it. Like I said, I don't really spend money so I had saved a good amount of it so I could buy gifts for holidays. This led to my parents ""borrowing"" my money all the time so they could buy stuff and would either take literal months to pay me back or just never pay me back at all. I ended up just canceling the card all together because I was tired of it, so now all I have is paper money.

Now the issue: My parents got into some stupid fight about 3 days ago because my mom (49) walked all the way to the store, alone at night, in Texas heat just to get my dad (47) some cigarettes. Apparently on the walk back as my mom was walking close to our house a skunk with it's tail all the way up walked by, so she didn't want to cross its path. A dude driving passed by and she asked him for a ride home. When she got home my dad saw her being dropped off and thanking the guy, and immediately started calling her a whore after she just bought him cigarettes with the money we barely had. As a result of this, for the past few days my house has been tense and every now and then my dad will start screaming at my mom and slamming doors hard enough to break them (which he's done before).
