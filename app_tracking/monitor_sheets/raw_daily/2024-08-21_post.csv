0,1ext197,AITA for telling my friend she can't change her name?,"My(19F) friend (19F), who we will call El, and I grew up closely. Our moms met at college and always wanted to have kids at the same time so we were pushed to be best friends.


El got bullied at middle school, causing severe anxiety.


El would text the guys I was with, and said it was because she couldn't believe a guy would choose me over her and it ruined her confidence. As soon as she got validation that they would cheat for her she would stop, she wasn't interested in the guys.


We still hang out a lot but we have never really had a deep connection, but still have lots of love for her because she can't help the way she is and I've known her forever.


I feel worried for whatever untreated issues she has going on (I have tried to talk to her and her mom but just get a hard response back).


When we hangout she cannot deal with a second of silence because she is worried the other person will think she is being awkward.


If we meet up with her friends together she will give me dirty looks or jab me in the side if she thinks I'm not talking enough, sometimes whispering ""You're embarrassing me, they are going to wonder why you don't talk."" Even if I am already being social. It is very hurtful and makes me more reserved.


She wants to change her name to something more charming, so people like her more based on first impressions. She also said she associates her deadname with being bullied. I was supportive in this.


Last week she told me she is going to legally change her name to the shortening of mine. My name is Lilian. She told me she is changing her name to Lily, which is my nickname and what my mom calls me. Even El calls me it instead of Lilian. She said it so casually, like pretending the two names are completely different.


I was very confused and started asking why she would choose the name but she acted confused as to why it bothered me so much, and even got rude about it.


Her mom is defending her saying it's a lovely name and not even my name so there's nothing weird about it at all. Her mom adores me and is so nice so I just don't understand how she would defend the name.


Our moms have fallen out over it as my mom thinks it's really creepy and unfair.


I have told her she can't use my name as it's creepy and there are so many better names out there she could have picked. She keeps saying it's just a name and not even my name.


She sent me a video today, which was ""What your name would be in a historical ficton""


your birth month = Darling, Miss, Princess, Damsel, followed by your first name.


She texted, ""I'm Darling Lily! What's yours?"" And I responded with ""Princess Lily too of course."" And she said ""Um. You can't be Lily as well. I'm Lily. Just use your middle name?"" She knows I have an ugly middle name, but yeah that was just her trying to force her new name onto me and it felt horrible.
