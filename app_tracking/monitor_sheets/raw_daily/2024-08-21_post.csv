0,1ext197,AITA for telling my friend she can't change her name?,"My(19F) friend (19F), who we will call El, and I grew up closely. Our moms met at college and always wanted to have kids at the same time so we were pushed to be best friends.


El got bullied at middle school, causing severe anxiety.


El would text the guys I was with, and said it was because she couldn't believe a guy would choose me over her and it ruined her confidence. As soon as she got validation that they would cheat for her she would stop, she wasn't interested in the guys.


We still hang out a lot but we have never really had a deep connection, but still have lots of love for her because she can't help the way she is and I've known her forever.


I feel worried for whatever untreated issues she has going on (I have tried to talk to her and her mom but just get a hard response back).


When we hangout she cannot deal with a second of silence because she is worried the other person will think she is being awkward.


If we meet up with her friends together she will give me dirty looks or jab me in the side if she thinks I'm not talking enough, sometimes whispering ""You're embarrassing me, they are going to wonder why you don't talk."" Even if I am already being social. It is very hurtful and makes me more reserved.


She wants to change her name to something more charming, so people like her more based on first impressions. She also said she associates her deadname with being bullied. I was supportive in this.


Last week she told me she is going to legally change her name to the shortening of mine. My name is Lilian. She told me she is changing her name to Lily, which is my nickname and what my mom calls me. Even El calls me it instead of Lilian. She said it so casually, like pretending the two names are completely different.


I was very confused and started asking why she would choose the name but she acted confused as to why it bothered me so much, and even got rude about it.


Her mom is defending her saying it's a lovely name and not even my name so there's nothing weird about it at all. Her mom adores me and is so nice so I just don't understand how she would defend the name.


Our moms have fallen out over it as my mom thinks it's really creepy and unfair.


I have told her she can't use my name as it's creepy and there are so many better names out there she could have picked. She keeps saying it's just a name and not even my name.


She sent me a video today, which was ""What your name would be in a historical ficton""


your birth month = Darling, Miss, Princess, Damsel, followed by your first name.


She texted, ""I'm Darling Lily! What's yours?"" And I responded with ""Princess Lily too of course."" And she said ""Um. You can't be Lily as well. I'm Lily. Just use your middle name?"" She knows I have an ugly middle name, but yeah that was just her trying to force her new name onto me and it felt horrible.

1,1ey4255,AITA for wanting my own room?,"So I‚Äôve shared a room with my sister for my whole life. She constantly complained about having to share a room with me. Not being able to turn on the lights because I‚Äôm sleeping, me snoring, etc. I felt bad because I‚Äôm a people pleaser but there was really nothing I could do. Well, about a year ago my sister got Covid and I wasn‚Äôt allowed to sleep in the same room as her. I slept in the office area (which had a pullout bed) until her sickness went away. After that I went up to her and I kid you not the first thing she says is ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not going to sleep in here right?‚Äú I was really annoyed but I just left it at that and slept in the office for a year.  
Now a few weeks ago my brother went off to college and I get his room. I was super excited because I haven‚Äôt had my own room my whole life. Well I‚Äôve gotten to sleep in his/my room. I asked to take down the posters in the room because I didn‚Äôt like them but for some reason I was told no with no reason. Then I finally just got told that it‚Äôs still his room and I‚Äôm just living in it so I get out of the office. I was LIVID. I asked what I even could do because ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt my room‚Äù even though HES IN COLLEGE AND IS ONLY HERE 2 MONTHS IN A YEAR, Yet its not my room.

3,1ey3n36,WIBTA if I move back with parents after moving in with grandma?,"I (24, F) recently moved in with my grandma (83) about a year after my aunt and grandpa passed away back-to-back, in which they both lived with her. I was living at an apartment at that time for my own freedom and space and my grandma suggested me moving in with her. I gave it some thought and my parents really liked the idea, bc they didn't want her living alone nor did they want to force her to move in with us into our slightly smaller house. She's very healthy and can take care of herself. We have surveillance cameras in her hours and we live on the street right over from hers, literally 1 minute drive.

I moved back with my parents after we thought our family dog was going to die. I'm not financially burdened in any way; I've had a full time job for 3 years and I'm currently applying to grad school. I moved into my aunt's room, and I'm not spooked, but I'm extremely sad and uncomfortable. I feel a lot of anxiety being here. I grew up sleeping over at my grandma's house every weekend, but now I don't feel any freedom or comfort here at all. My grandma is a sweet little lady and she minds her own business and lets me do whatever I want, whether it's rearranging things in the kitchen as I please or going out all day. She literally told me to pretend that it's my house now and that she's even not there.

I work second shift, so I'm not home all day regardless, but I am a night owl so I stay up quite late and sleep until 11-noon. I made a compromise to sleep at my parents' on my days off work and at my grandma's house on my work days, and that I would reconsider living there if I still feel uncomfortable after a month or two, bc I know things take time to get used to.

4,1ey3mqy,AITA for going to dinner with my father and his new girlfriend?,"My (25f) parents have been divorced for almost two years. My mother (45f) left my dad (48m) for one of her coworkers. It was a horrible situation that left my dad heartbroken and almost giving up on life. 

My dad told me the only things that kept him going were me and my sister. Needless to say my sister and I both sided with our dad which left my mom angry with both of us. I made it clear to her that a I really hate the guy she left my dad for and will never, ever meet him or have any type of relationship with him. I just thinks he‚Äôs a real scumbag. 

Well now two years after the divorce my sister and I have discovered that our dad is dating someone! She is someone he went to high school with and dated for a while back then. He reconnected with her at a reunion for his high school class back in December last year.

I guess they started messaging and then dating. My sister and I went to my dad‚Äôs place on Sunday morning to bring coffee and donuts which is something we do occasionally. When we got there this lady was there with my dad and it was apparent that she had spent the night. They both were surprised we showed up and my dad started to explain to us but we are both happy that he‚Äôs moving on.

Anyway my dad called us both on Monday and asked if we‚Äôd like to go to dinner with them this Saturday evening so we can get to know her a little better. We both said yes.

That‚Äôs where the problem starts. Our mother found out from my sister what‚Äôs going on and is really mad that two years on we have yet to meet the person she‚Äôs with but here we are going to dinner with my dad‚Äôs new girlfriend. My answer to this is that my dad‚Äôs girlfriend didn‚Äôt help destroy his marriage and the person my mother is with did. 

We have both made it clear to her that we will not have a relationship with that man. We both try to have a relationship with our mother and our dad has always said we should forgive her and have a good relationship with her. But with that man? Forget it.

7,1ey31tb,AITAH for being cold and short with my sister after she chose her friend over me on my Birthday ,"My sister and I are both teenagers with me being 2 years older than her, I am the eldest daughter. Throughout our childhood it has been very emphasized that being at a friend's house or anywhere that you don't have to be on a siblings birthday is completely unacceptable. There was many times I wanted to go places with friends but I wasn't allowed because it was her birthday. I always found this rule fair because it's a day to celebrate the life of your loved ones and why would we want to miss it anyways? 
My sister has recently been very angry due to personal reasons but she has been letting it out on me. She constantly yells at me, gives me the cold shoulder, insults me, and tries everything in her power to hurt me then cries and says she's a horrible person and I should hate her. I end up having to comfort her and it's exhausting and to be honest, a little irritating. 

Today one of her best friends (Lily) mom said a friend (Jane) of her and her best friend was visiting for a while and was wondering if she wanted to stay at her house so she, Lily and Jane can all hang out. Jane is staying from Friday-Sunday, my birthday is on Sunday. My sister said she wanted to stay the whole time so she can hang out with her friends, I brought it up that my birthday is on the Sunday and she said ""Well Jane is gonna be here"" and completely shrugged me off. To be honest it hurt a little bit especially because I take such priority to be there on her birthday and it feels like she's choosing her friend over me. Another thing that makes me a little more upset is that I had planned a day for me and my family that I knew that she and everyone else would love and she knows my plan and told me she was ecstatic and couldn't wait. Not only that but she previously promised that she would not miss my birthday for the world. I know this seems so miniscule and insignificant but it is very important she is here and she is well aware of that.
 
After this happened I was kind of cold and gave her short responses as I was frustrated and hurt by her actions.

8,1ey2zhk,AITA for texting a stranger to stfu?,"I (24M) was speaking to my friend Ryan (Fake Name 24M) about potentially having him come help move some heavy items. We initially spoke over instagram. He asked me to text his phone number the details of what was needed. I went to check if i still had his number and I apparently still had it. I texted him the details of what was needed thinking it was him. Boy was I wrong

It turns out he changed his number because a father texted back saying that it wasn‚Äôt Ryan and it was his 13 year old daughter‚Äôs phone. I was caught off guard and profusely apologized by saying ‚Äúoh I am very sorry!! This used to be my friends number and I thought it still was. Sorry for any confusion‚Äù thinking it was the end of that conversation 

Well it wasn‚Äôt. The dude proceeded to ask why I was texting his 13 year old daughter‚Äôs phone at 9 pm on a Tuesday. I, politely, explained that I was trying to text my friend some info and the number was his contact info in my phone. I, again, apologized.

Well that wasn‚Äôt good enough for him, and he proceeded to tell me that this had been his daughter‚Äôs phone number for the last 2 years. Having some annoyance, I replied that this was my friends number at least 4 years ago. I promised him that I would lose the number and leave it at that

This is where I may be the AH. This guy ends up CALLING me and states how I am such a creep for calling his 13 year old daughter and that he has half a mind to call the cops.

I (24M) was speaking to my friend Ryan (Fake Name 24M) about potentially having him come help move some heavy items. We initially spoke over instagram. He asked me to text his phone number the details of what was needed. I went to check if i still had his number and I apparently still had it. I texted him the details of what was needed thinking it was him. Boy was I wrong

It turns out he changed his number because a father texted back saying that it wasn‚Äôt Ryan and it was his 13 year old daughter‚Äôs phone. I was caught off guard and profusely apologized by saying ‚Äúoh I am very sorry!! This used to be my friends number and I thought it still was. Sorry for any confusion‚Äù thinking it was the end of that conversation 

Well it wasn‚Äôt. The dude proceeded to ask why I was texting his 13 year old daughter‚Äôs phone at 9 pm on a Tuesday. I, politely, explained that I was trying to text my friend some info and the number was his contact info in my phone. I, again, apologized.

Well that wasn‚Äôt good enough for him, and he proceeded to tell me that this had been his daughter‚Äôs phone number for the last 2 years. Having some annoyance, I replied that this was my friends number at least 4 years ago. I promised him that I would lose the number and leave it at that

This is where I may be the AH. This guy ends up CALLING me and states how I am such a creep for calling his 13 year old daughter and that he has half a mind to call the cops.

We are each having a maid of honor, and our two respective siblings stand with us. My two sisters, her two brothers. Here is the problem: Her brothers went to buy suits last week, and I only just found out what they bought. LIGHT grey suits, and coloured shirts to match our wedding colours. I had no idea about any of this. I assumed black suits and ties to match the colours was the ONLY choice, but, when they argued that they were BUYING suits, not renting, we agreed they could buy grey, just not blue or brown as it would clash with the wedding colours.

She did not know that my fiances older brother would be bringing his wife.

They did not even show her the suits they bought AFTER the fact. They only sent the photos to their mother.         
Her younger brother is quiet and shy, and I understand him just going along with what his brother and sister in law said, and apparently, the older brothers wife just LOVED the light grey suit.

I just don‚Äôt like the idea of lending her $ again while her husband has gold/silver/etc. just sitting there when they could use it now. This worries me as our mom also got involved and I‚Äôd rather help my sister than having mom help her, as she is on a low, fixed income.

18,1ey0owu,AITA for Refusing to Let My Wife Hang Her Childhood Blanket in Our Living Room?,"Sooo My wife (34F) and I (36M) recently moved into our first home together after saving up for years.

My wife has this old, tattered blanket that she‚Äôs had since she was a baby. It‚Äôs clearly been well-loved‚Äîmeaning, it‚Äôs falling apart, faded, and covered in stains that have probably been there for decades. I get that it holds a lot of sentimental value for her, and I‚Äôm totally cool with her keeping it in the house.

However, she wants to hang it on the wall in our living room as ‚Äúart.‚Äù I was pretty shocked when she brought it up because, to be honest, the blanket looks more like something that belongs in a storage box than on display in our main living area. The living room is the first thing people see when they walk into our house, and I was hoping to keep it looking somewhat stylish and presentable.

I suggested that we could hang it in our bedroom or maybe in her home office instead, where it would still be visible and special, but not as front-and-center. But she‚Äôs adamant that the living room is where she wants it because that‚Äôs where she spends the most time, and she says it makes her feel safe and happy.

21,1ey07tg,AITA for resenting my disabled sister,"Growing up, people have often told me that I am the most understanding, caring, and loving girl in the world and that I would make an excellent mother someday because of how well I take care of my sister. When I Was younger, I took these comments as the highest praise. However, now that I'm 14 years old, I don't think I feel the same way anymore.

My sister, F17, was born with down syndrome. It was detected before birth but my parents decided against terminating the pregnancy and my sister was born. She didn't have any MAJOR health issues but there are a lot of things she is incapable of doing. She can't get dressed by herself, she often soils her clothes (yes including poo), she can't speak clearly or really express herself, she can't make food for herself. There are more things but basically what i'm trying to say is she will never be able to depend on just herself, somebody will always have to take care of her and unfortunately one day when my parents die that person will be me.

A few days ago, my parents found an old journal entry in my room. It was me wishing my sister was born ‚Äúnormal‚Äù They confronted me the next morning,demanding to know how I could feel that way about my own sister. My mom said it was ""wrong"" and ""unacceptable"" for me to have such thoughts, insisting that my sister  is a ""blessing"" that I should be grateful for. My dad angrily told me that caring for my sister is my ""responsibility"" and that it would be ""selfish"" of me to not devote my life to her. I tried to explain that as I've gotten older, my feelings have become more complicated. The cute sibling bond we once shared feels different now that I'm facing the reality of having to be sisters primary caretaker when our parents are gone. I admitted to resenting how much time and energy goes into managing sisters needs, and how ashamed I sometimes feel about her disability. But my parents refused to listen, insisting that any negative feelings are inherently wrong.

I guess they're right in a way, I do feel incredibly selfish for feeling this way. I stay up for hours watching tiktok's of people that have such close bonds with their older sisters and it makes me cry at night. I feel awful whenever people stare at her or make fun of her in public because with a mindset like this, truly am no different from them. I feel embarassed to show my friends family photos because I don't want people to say anything about her. I never let my friends come to my room because I share a room with my sister and it's filled with childish stuff that she likes. The room is often messy because she just throws stuff on the floor rather than actually putting it away. As I said before, my sister wets the bed sometimes which makes my room smell horrible and i'm so ashamed to have people come over. The house is always messy even when me and my mom spend all day cleaning because my sister can never clean up after herself, I spend hours everyday cleaning just to feel normal but she messes it up within an hour. Sometimes I get mad and I yell at her, my parents say I'm too harsh and mean to her.

I feel like a horrible person because how can I hate someone for something they can't control, I know she didn't ask to be born the way she was but sometimes I look at her and I feel such genuine resentment and hate in my heart. I sometimes pray to God to make me stop feeling this way about her and make me be able to love her unconditionally but it never works.

I, F(17), was in a situationship with this guy, also 17, for around 3 years. We had first started talking for almost 9 months and then would send explicit photos to each other on and off for almost 2 years. My then best friend, Katie, knew about my huge crush on this guy and what we had done with each other. However a few months after us meeting, she also began liking him. He was, unknowingly to us both, entertaining both of us at the same time. Since I really liked him, I told her that we were talking and hoped she would give up on him so I could keep him. She told me she didn't like him that much and would leave him alone. I admit this was wrong of me, because I probably just should've left him alone.

25,1exzjgt,AITA for not outing my serial cheater of a friend?,"I (25F) have been friends with Elliot (25M) for around 3 years. We get along great, he is funny and easy going.
Almost 2 years ago Elliot started to date Sarah. I met Sarah only 3-4 times, and immediately saw she is a very sweet and nice girl.

However only a few month after they started dating, Elliot told me he cheated on her. Of course I do not condone cheating and scolded him, he seemed genuinely sorry. But over the whole course of their relationship, everytime I saw Elliot every few months, he had more stories about him cheating with multiple girls. Sometimes he seemed genuinely sorry, sometimes he was laughing about it. We had multiple conversation where basically I told Elliot he is wrong, he is the asshole, and he said he knows and would try to stop. But he kept going. He is even in therapy for it but won't stop and won't dump Sarah. He even admitted it to his girlfriend a few times, she caught him a few times, but he would always promised to stop cheating and she always decided to stay with him. I am really against it and told Elliot that she should dump his ass, but am still friends with him. I am not close to Sarah and live in another country, so the few times I am home I only see Elliott.

Onto what happened. We went abroad last month with a few friends to celebrate my birthday. Elliott was there a day earlier, when the rest arrived he announced he met a girl at a club and spent the day and night with her. He then proceeds to spend the whole trip with this girl. We barely saw him the whole trip and when we did he brought her and acted like they were in a relationship. He asked us not to mention Sarah to her. We complied, but it has been tormenting me a lot.

The worst is that he previously told Sarah it was my birthday trip, and apparently she said she was reassured he won't cheat on her because I will be there and she trusts me. This broke my heart.
I am also mad he missed out on most of my bday trip. It also made my own boyfriend insecure to see my friend cheat so openly and easily and none of us doing much about it, and caused tension in my own relationship. 
We told Eliott he is an asshole but that's it. I didn't want to ruin the trip over this.

I feel really morally conflicted but I don't want to cause drama and ruin the friendship. So AITA for not doing anything and not outing him to Sarah?


Edit:
I talked with Elliot today with the intention of telling him to either tell Sarah or I will.
And he told me they finally broke up!!!
They commonly agreed that they cannot keep going and that he is not going to change. So I guess this is a happy ending  for Sarah.",Asshole,2024-08-21,"AITA for not outing my serial cheater of a friend? I (25F) have been friends with Elliot (25M) for around 3 years. We get along great, he is funny and easy going.
Almost 2 years ago Elliot started to date Sarah. I met Sarah only 3-4 times, and immediately saw she is a very sweet and nice girl.

However only a few month after they started dating, Elliot told me he cheated on her. Of course I do not condone cheating and scolded him, he seemed genuinely sorry. But over the whole course of their relationship, everytime I saw Elliot every few months, he had more stories about him cheating with multiple girls. Sometimes he seemed genuinely sorry, sometimes he was laughing about it. We had multiple conversation where basically I told Elliot he is wrong, he is the asshole, and he said he knows and would try to stop. But he kept going. He is even in therapy for it but won't stop and won't dump Sarah. He even admitted it to his girlfriend a few times, she caught him a few times, but he would always promised to stop cheating and she always decided to stay with him. I am really against it and told Elliot that she should dump his ass, but am still friends with him. I am not close to Sarah and live in another country, so the few times I am home I only see Elliott.

29,1exxops,AITA for asking to be consulted before having people over?,"
My BF (30M) and I (35F) have been in a relationship for 12 years, moved in together 6 years ago. 

We live in his house, but everything in it is mine, except for a couple of things which he bought. He has paid for the renovation of the house, so it was only fair I paid for the furniture and other things. This is to say that I have contributed to this house and I am not just living off his back. 

On to the problem:

I haven't been feeling great lately, I'm having a really rough time with everything and the last thing I need is having people over, especially people I do not particularly like. 

My BF wanted to invite his friend over for lunch (actually she suggested that herself, he just agreed to it), and he asked me if I would be OK with it. Obviously, I said no, I'm not in the mood for people or making small talk and pretending things are great. I expressed that to him and it caused a huge argument. 

He claims that I would not even have to be there for lunch if I didn't want to, they would just stay in the kitchen and mind their own business (the house is pretty big, so I'd have my space if I wanted to eat in the living room for instance). I said I would like to have lunch in the kitchen because I want a break from work (I work from home and I hate eating in front of my PC, it feels like it's not really a break) and it's also not fair to me to have to isolate myself because he's having his friend over. 

He accused me of conditioning him not to have people over, said he can do that whenever he wants and I don't have to be there and socialise if I'm not feeling it. He said that he would not have any problem if it were the opposite, I can bring over friends whenever I like, he only wants a heads up and not a request for permission to do that. 

I do not have any issue whatsoever with him going out with friends, whether male or female. In fact, the same issue arose when he invited over a guy friend. He has gone out with the same female friend out for breakfast lots of time and I did not say a thing. And no, they are not romantically involved. 

I feel severely hurt and disrespected. I would not even consider bringing people over if he told me he does not want to see them, as I would find it unfair to him. He says it's unfair to him that he is not able to invite his friends over because of me.

My bf planned it as he knows how much I love the Cheesecake Factory. I REALLY love their cheesecake (this becomes important later)

Well everything was going fine and we were having a good time until an elderly man at the next table scooted his chair out just as our server was approaching, causing him to stumble and spill hot coffee on me( down my back). It was obviously burning and startled me so I instinctively screamed and pulled my shirt up. 

I‚Äôm pretty small chested so I don‚Äôt typically wear a bra and obviously I wasn‚Äôt thinking about that when something hot was running down my back burning me so I basically flashed all those at the tables around us. Yes I was embarrassed but at the same time it‚Äôs just boobs. I pulled my shirt back down right after realizing what happened but it was up for about 15 seconds. The server apologized over and over but it wasn‚Äôt their fault it was all just an accident. 

Well anyway after this my bf wanted to leave, like immediately leave. He said that I was being overdramatic for the way I reacted in the situation and maybe I was but it did startle me really bad and it did burn. He told me I had put on a show for everyone in the restaurant especially since I screamed when it happened and that we need to leave. 

I told him it‚Äôs not that big a deal and that I really want to stay to get cheesecake because it‚Äôs my favorite, I eventually even offered to try to get some to go and he was dead set that we need to leave and didn‚Äôt understand why I wasn‚Äôt mortified. 

We ended up staying but for the rest of the date he kept saying that the men at tables near us were staring at me and probably thinking about me inappropriately but I said it wasn‚Äôt my problem if they‚Äôre being gross. 

When we got in the car he told me i ruined our anniversary for making him sit through that and we should have just left and that he can‚Äôt believe I would choose a piece of cheesecake over his comfortability.

THIS IS A LONG ONE SORRYYYYYYY
Backstory: I 28F have known this guy for a while and there was never anything romantic between us, just a neighbour and friend. He‚Äôs 26. I lived in my hometown for 10 years before moving and growing up in different state and most holidays go back to my hometown as my family has a holiday house there, which is where he lives, on the same street. 

I recently needed a break from life and went back to stay at my families house, I was all alone in a big house and the neighbours all checked up on me every now and then. He became a good friend, going to the shops with me, helping me around the house. All normal stuff. We became really close and hung out a lot. This went on for about a month or two before people started saying we would be great together and joking about us getting married (by people I mean his family who he lived with). After a few months of being home, I really wanted to just live my life there, get a job and start fresh again, I loved everything about being home. I felt like myself again, I was happy but I always knew it wasn‚Äôt going to be the best route for me. My family all live in the state I grew up in and low key was trying to get away from them. 
We started getting a bit flirty and relationship like. I had made my intentions clear from then that we were not official because I was unsure what my future would actually be like, would I stay in my hometown or would I be going back to my family state.   

We eventually started a situationship and honestly it was such a nice summer holiday, we went to the beach, my friends came to visit and it was like living in a movie. He basically stayed at my house, as my family weren‚Äôt there. Everything just was going smooth. But I always had it in the back of my mind that this wouldn‚Äôt be a forever thing. 
Eventually I had to put my adult boots on ultimately made the decision that staying there wouldn‚Äôt work for me, I have plans and goals I want to accomplish and being in my small hometown wasn‚Äôt going to help me achieve them. So I made the decision, said my goodbyes and flew back to my family. (Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I cried a lot over this). 

We chatted and called everyday after I left, however I soon found a really good job and started working and this is where things went down hill between us. I was super busy, working 12/14 hour days, exhausted as I was still trying to get into a routine. He became obsessive and super clingy. If I didn‚Äôt respond to his messages in 5 minutes he would call me nonstop. The one day I finished work and had 25 long paragraph messages and 15 missed calls from him, all within an hour. He would want to call me and message me 24/7 and I‚Äôm just not like that, which I had told him multiple times. I started to work more and started living my life, going out with friends and he would comment on everything I did. If I wasn‚Äôt giving him attention he was going to my Facebook or Instagram and liking EVERY SINGLE picture or post (some from 2010 even). I eventually got frustrated and spoke to him about how he needs to live his life and I‚Äôm really busy and this was all too much for me. Everytime his response was the same ‚ÄúI will do anything for you, I will move to your state, you  are my everything‚Äù which put me off even more. So I bit my tongue and ignored it. 
Reality is I really just wanted to tell him to stop being so obsessive and clingy but I never ever wanted to hurt him, he‚Äôs a really sweet guy and honestly someone would be lucky to have him, but he‚Äôs just not the right guy for me, so I always let him down nicely by saying he needs to find himself and travel the world (he‚Äôs never left my hometown) and find himself because he‚Äôs still young and there‚Äôs so much more in the world right now. 

To make a long story a bit shorter, he never stopped, he carried on messaging and calling. I would wake up to long messages from him talking about how much he loves me and he carried on being clingy and super needy. So I just started ignoring him. I know it‚Äôs mean but I tried to explain in every nice way possible how I was feeling about everything and he always made it about him and how he will fight for me. Apart of me feels bad, because I know I did hurt him, and he‚Äôll message me and tell me how‚Äôs he‚Äôs heartbroken and just not the same anymore, but another part of me just wants to scream because I tried every single way to let him down nicely but he always made it about his wants and how he will never give up on me, I just didn‚Äôt want to be horrible and take my frustrations out on him and how he was being so I chose to just ignore him. 

It‚Äôs been 3 months now and he unfollowed me on Instagram but every week sends me a follow request/then deletes it/ then sends it again. I don‚Äôt want to accept his request because I feel like he‚Äôs just being so childish and I don‚Äôt want that in my life.

Reality is I really just wanted to tell him to stop being so obsessive and clingy but I never ever wanted to hurt him, he‚Äôs a really sweet guy and honestly someone would be lucky to have him, but he‚Äôs just not the right guy for me, so I always let him down nicely by saying he needs to find himself and travel the world (he‚Äôs never left my hometown) and find himself because he‚Äôs still young and there‚Äôs so much more in the world right now. 

To make a long story a bit shorter, he never stopped, he carried on messaging and calling. I would wake up to long messages from him talking about how much he loves me and he carried on being clingy and super needy. So I just started ignoring him. I know it‚Äôs mean but I tried to explain in every nice way possible how I was feeling about everything and he always made it about him and how he will fight for me. Apart of me feels bad, because I know I did hurt him, and he‚Äôll message me and tell me how‚Äôs he‚Äôs heartbroken and just not the same anymore, but another part of me just wants to scream because I tried every single way to let him down nicely but he always made it about his wants and how he will never give up on me, I just didn‚Äôt want to be horrible and take my frustrations out on him and how he was being so I chose to just ignore him. 

It‚Äôs been 3 months now and he unfollowed me on Instagram but every week sends me a follow request/then deletes it/ then sends it again. I don‚Äôt want to accept his request because I feel like he‚Äôs just being so childish and I don‚Äôt want that in my life. 

So Am I the asshole for ignoring him?",,0.022427817806601524,0,0
32,1exx6ey,AITA for complaining about the food my ex makes?,"For some context I (40) and my ex wife (35F) got divorced five years ago. While we were together we had twin girls. We maintain a healthy co-parent relationship and she‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt prefer to communicate outside of that.

When my wife and I were together she enjoyed making things from scratch. Mostly food but clothes as well. She would always tell me she wanted to live on a farm. I always thought that it was all a waste of money, but let it be.

Now that we‚Äôre divorced, she moved onto the farm she always wanted and grows various kinds of fruits and vegetables. She has also continued to make even more food from scratch but now feeds this food to our daughters. Apparently it makes up most of their diet.

The problem comes in when it is mealtime when I have custody of our daughters. The girls refuse to eat anything I make. I usually use store bought pasta, bread, jam, cheese, yogurt etc, all things their mother makes for scratch. They often complain about the taste and say they can taste the difference if I try and lie to them.

I talked to my ex about this a few times. Her solution was to send over a few things to give them. But I really don‚Äôt see the point in not just giving them regular food. It seems like they are developing a snobbish attitude from this. I communicated this to my ex but she keeps saying it‚Äôs healthier and that she isn‚Äôt going to keep arguing with me.

40,1exw2ct,AITA? He dumped me because I didn't post him on Instagram on his birthday.,"My boyfriend(M40) and I(M26) have been together for a year. As his 40th birthday approached, I agreed to plan his party and buy him a MacBook Pro M3, but I couldn't afford such an expensive gift. Despite that, I worked hard on planning the party, arranging venue viewings, and coordinating with caterers. I even bought him a $1000 iPad, which was a significant financial strain for me.

When his birthday arrived, we went out for dinner with his friends, but my card didn't work, so he paid the bill. The night ended quietly. The next day, I told him I needed some time alone before the party, as I often need space to recharge. He called me selfish for not being there the night before his party, which I found confusing but tried to brush off.

The party itself went well, and he appreciated the iPad. After the party, he chose to go to bed while I went out with his friends. The next day, we had a relaxing morning together, but when he dropped me off at home, he broke up with me. He was upset that I hadn't posted about him on social media on his actual birthday, accusing me of hiding him and cheating.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-21,"AITA? He dumped me because I didn't post him on Instagram on his birthday. My boyfriend(M40) and I(M26) have been together for a year. As his 40th birthday approached, I agreed to plan his party and buy him a MacBook Pro M3, but I couldn't afford such an expensive gift. Despite that, I worked hard on planning the party, arranging venue viewings, and coordinating with caterers. I even bought him a $1000 iPad, which was a significant financial strain for me.

When his birthday arrived, we went out for dinner with his friends, but my card didn't work, so he paid the bill. The night ended quietly. The next day, I told him I needed some time alone before the party, as I often need space to recharge. He called me selfish for not being there the night before his party, which I found confusing but tried to brush off.

The party itself went well, and he appreciated the iPad. After the party, he chose to go to bed while I went out with his friends. The next day, we had a relaxing morning together, but when he dropped me off at home, he broke up with me. He was upset that I hadn't posted about him on social media on his actual birthday, accusing me of hiding him and cheating. I explained that I don't care much for social media and didn't realize it mattered to him.

Now, I'm left feeling frustrated and wondering if I was wrong for how I handled everything, especially considering the effort I put into his birthday and the financial burden it placed on me.

41,1exw1g5,WIBTA if I took a detour by myself in a trip I organized?,"Last June, I (28M) told my friends (Ivy, Lea, Jay, we‚Äôre all around the same age) that I‚Äôm planning to have a vacation for myself later this August.

I told them I‚Äôm visiting an art gallery located at a popular tourist destination in our country (the destination is an entire city that‚Äôs about a 5-hour drive from us). When they learned that I‚Äôm going to the tourist destination, they asked if they could tag along since they wanted to vacation as well. I agreed since they‚Äôre my closest friend group, and we‚Äôre all excited. My overnight trip turned into a 3D2N hangout with my friends.

In our group, I‚Äôve always been the default ‚Äúplanner‚Äù (I‚Äôm happy to do so!) plus I‚Äôm also the only one who has been to the tourist destination multiple times (I‚Äôve gone like 10 times already. Ivy and Lea have only been there once, and Jay has never been).

When I was creating the itinerary, I asked for their inputs if there are any places they‚Äôd like to visit. Jay listed a lot of the usual ‚Äútouristy‚Äù places, Lea listed some restaurants we could try, and Ivy listed several shopping areas. I tried to cram everything into the schedule, but since the art gallery I‚Äôd like to visit was so out of the way from the main tourist spot, we had to make some compromises. We then put it into a vote, where any stop that didn‚Äôt get at least 2 votes might be dropped from the itinerary if necessary. Unfortunately, the art gallery was the only one that got one vote. I made the necessary adjustments, but then I found a window in our schedule that could work.

I told them that while the three of them are shopping, I could go to the art gallery by myself. After all, Ivy and Lea are really looking forward to thrift store-hopping for clothes and trinkets, but I‚Äôm really not into that since I‚Äôm not a fashion and crafts guy. That way, we don‚Äôt have to drop anything from the itinerary and I could still stick to my original plan. I told them I‚Äôd drop them off at the shopping centers, drive to the art gallery, then I‚Äôll pick them up again after 2 hours, then we‚Äôll go to dinner together.

When I told them this suggestion, Ivy and Lea got so pissed at me for planning to take a detour by myself and splitting from the group. Jay was kinda neutral on everything since he's more looking forward to the usual tourist spots. I told them that since they don‚Äôt want to go to the art gallery and I don‚Äôt like to go shopping, it seemed like a fair and harmless compromise. I also reminded them that it was actually my original plan for my supposed solo trip. They still insisted that I‚Äôm the AH for not honoring the group‚Äôs vote and that I took advantage of the fact that I planned everything and that I‚Äôll be driving.

Just for additional context, the hotel has already been booked and reservations have been made, so canceling the trip is not an option.

For the past year and a half, I have been creating a DnD campaign.

Most politely declined. Fast forward to about a week ago. I am having a conversation with one of the friends, and DnD was brought up. I mentioned that the campaign was finished, and they asked if they could play. 3 of her other friends also were interested (I was friends with one, and had met the other 2). I said that yes, they could play.

Please note: asking them to join was an in the moment thing. It wasn't planned out before hand.

Her answer: ""No thanks, I'm not interested in playing. I just wanted to tell you that it was rude for you not to invite me and that I still think it is.""

I originally thought my reasoning for not inviting her was solid, and that she was just being ridiculous, especially since she didn't actually want to join. After the argument though, I don't know if I was in the right or not.

We've been close since childhood, but three years ago, Lexi‚Äôs family moved to another country. Since then, we‚Äôve relied on Discord and Facetime to stay in touch despite the time difference. A year ago, Lexi started dating someone she met online named Shawn (M20). Given Lexi's history with a controlling ex, Kelly and I were hesitant but wanted her to be happy, so we agreed to meet Shawn. Shawn introduced some of his own friends, and we all clicked. Shawn lives in the same country as Kelly and me, so I asked if they were in a long-distance relationship. Lexi confirmed but mentioned she was planning to move back for college. We marked the date on our calendars, excited for her return.

But then, Lexi‚Äôs parents decided not to move back and wouldn‚Äôt allow Lexi to move on her own. Lexi was devastated, and despite our efforts to help her convince her parents, nothing changed. Afterward, Lexi became noticeably meaner, especially toward Shawn. Once, Shawn introduced Lexi to another online group, hoping to help her make new friends. Lexi fixated on a girl in the group who interacted more with Shawn and later told us she asked Shawn to stay away from the girl because she ""seemed too into him."" Lexi continued sending us screenshots of their interactions, insisting the girl was flirting, though the messages were harmless.

Now, here‚Äôs where we might have been in the wrong. Initially, we agreed to meet up when Lexi returned, but when it became clear she wouldn‚Äôt, we stopped discussing it to avoid upsetting her. Then, two months ago, Jonah's (M20) birthday came up. Originally, Kelly and I planned to hang out alone, but I mentioned it to Shawn, who invited us to celebrate Jonah's birthday together. We hesitated, knowing Lexi would react badly, but ultimately decided not to tell her. Shawn even suggested we keep the outing quiet to avoid Lexi‚Äôs wrath.

Two additional moments where I might have been in the wrong: After Jonah's birthday, Shawn helped me with college enrollment (we attend the same college, another sore subject, because she was supposed to attend this college), and we got ice cream afterward. Lexi knew about this and was passive-aggressive with me for a week. Later, a fan screening of a movie I liked was announced in another city. I mentioned in the group chat that I wasn't sure if my parents would let me go alone. Shawn offered to come with me since he lived in the city, and I accepted. After the movie, we went to a barcade.

But then, Lexi‚Äôs parents decided not to move back and wouldn‚Äôt allow Lexi to move on her own. Lexi was devastated, and despite our efforts to help her convince her parents, nothing changed. Afterward, Lexi became noticeably meaner, especially toward Shawn. Once, Shawn introduced Lexi to another online group, hoping to help her make new friends. Lexi fixated on a girl in the group who interacted more with Shawn and later told us she asked Shawn to stay away from the girl because she ""seemed too into him."" Lexi continued sending us screenshots of their interactions, insisting the girl was flirting, though the messages were harmless.

Now, here‚Äôs where we might have been in the wrong. Initially, we agreed to meet up when Lexi returned, but when it became clear she wouldn‚Äôt, we stopped discussing it to avoid upsetting her. Then, two months ago, Jonah's (M20) birthday came up. Originally, Kelly and I planned to hang out alone, but I mentioned it to Shawn, who invited us to celebrate Jonah's birthday together. We hesitated, knowing Lexi would react badly, but ultimately decided not to tell her. Shawn even suggested we keep the outing quiet to avoid Lexi‚Äôs wrath.

Two additional moments where I might have been in the wrong: After Jonah's birthday, Shawn helped me with college enrollment (we attend the same college, another sore subject, because she was supposed to attend this college), and we got ice cream afterward. Lexi knew about this and was passive-aggressive with me for a week. Later, a fan screening of a movie I liked was announced in another city. I mentioned in the group chat that I wasn't sure if my parents would let me go alone. Shawn offered to come with me since he lived in the city, and I accepted. After the movie, we went to a barcade. Lexi doesn‚Äôt know about this, and I already feel guilty. Shawn disagrees, but I‚Äôd like a second opinion.",1.0,0.9202098250389099,1,1

 I allocate a good amount of my funds to things I need such as transportation and education savings. I was not aware I would need to allocate things like haircuts or my other needs, if I did I would pay for it myself and not buy things I want.

51,1exu3r7,AITA for going on outings with my friend's boyfriend? ,"I (F18) have these two friends, Kelly (F18) and Lexi (F18), we've been friends since diapers and lived in the same suburbs together up until three years ago when Lexi's family moved to a different country. Now the three of us have been stuck to discord messages and facetimes at odd hours of the day because of the time differences. 
A year ago, Lexi told us that she had been seeing someone on the internet and that she wanted us to meet him. This was Lexi's first relationship after \[Horrible Guy\] (who turned out to be a controlling, cheating asshole), so Kelly and I were a bit hesitant because we saw how bad Lexi got after \[Horrible Guy\], but we wanted Lexi to be happy so we went along with it and agreed to meet the guy. 
So Lexi adds her new boyfriend, Shawn (M20), to the group chat and we started talking and we all hit it off right away. Shawn even brought in a few of his own friends into the new friend group. Shawn tells us that he lives in the same country as Kelly and I, so I asked if they're doing long distance, and Lexi says yes, but not for long, because she's moving back to our country the next year for college. So we all celebrate and mark the date on our calendars. 
Flash forward to this year and Lexi's parents drops the bombshell that they wouldn't be moving back and they wouldn't be letting Lexi move back on her own either. Lexi called us crying over this and we all tried to comfort her and think of ways to convince her parents to let her move back (Spoiler: we failed and she wasn't able to move back). 
After the news, Lexi became noticably sulkier and meaner to all of us, especially to Shawn. 
One time that stuck with me was when Shawn introduced Lexi to an online friend group (not ours) he had, because he wanted Lexi to be more socialised (Lexi had a hard time making friends and mostly stuck to us when she lived in our country). Lexi then honed onto this one girl who didn't interact with Lexi much and talked more to Shawn. Lexi later tells Kelly and I that she told Shawn to stay away from the girl because ""she seemed way too into him"". This happened a few more times with the same girl, with Lexi sending us screenshots of the group chat with Shawn and the other girl's ""flirty messages"" (they weren't flirty in the slightest, the girl barely even talked to Shawn compared to her other friends in the group). 
Now comes the part we were probably assholes. 
So we all had agreed that we wanted our first meet up to be when Lexi returns to the country, but then the bombshell about Lexi not moving back dropped and we kind of stopped talking about meeting up in our group chat because we didn't want Lexi to start sending passive aggressive messages and acting sulky. 
Then Jonah's (M20) birthday rolled around two months ago. Originally it was only me and Kelly planning on going out, but I off-handedly mentioned it to Shawn in dms and he told me that it was Jonah's birthday on that day and asked if we wanted to get together and celebrate with him. I asked Kelly if it was fine with her and she agreed. Then we started planning where we wanted to go in each other's dms. I brought up to Shawn the elephant in the room that was Lexi, and Shawn just told me that I just keep quiet and not mention the outing to Lexi because she would throw a massive fit and give all of us the silent treatment if she found out. Kelly and I reluctantly agreed because we knew how Lexi was when mad. 
And now two additional asshole moments from me specifically.
After Jonah's birthday, Shawn went with me to enroll for my college classes (we're going to the same college, another sore spot for Lexi because she was supposed to be enrolled in this college) because this was my first time on campus and didn't know where was what and didn't want to waste time with being lost. After enrolling, Shawn and I went for ice cream because I just got braces and my teeth hurt. This outing Lexi knew about and acted catty with me for about a week. 
A few weeks later a fans screening of a movie I liked was announced and I basically raved about it and ranted because it was in a different city and I wasn't sure if my parents would let me go alone in our group chat. Shawn then dms me that he could come with me if I wanted because my parents already knew him and he lived in the same city as the fans screening and I agreed because I really wanted to go because there was an art book and poster for those who went to the fans screening instead of the regular movie.

52,1extga5,AITA for not going to my sister's birthday dinner with the rest of our family?,"My older sister turned 20 a week ago and she celebrated with dinner Saturday night. I (16m) didn't go with my parents and my brother (15m). I have another sister (23) who went and so did both sets of grandparents and our aunt and uncle. I'm the only family member who didn't show and my paternal grandparents are so pissed about it because she was upset.

I need to give some background. I'm adopted. My bio mother didn't want to be a parent and I was supposed to be raised by my first dad. But when I was 3 he got sick and after a few months he was told it was terminal. He didn't have family, being a former foster kid, my bio mother didn't want to take me and her family weren't interested either. So my first dad wanted to find a home for me. He wanted to be a part of picking the people who would raise me. He wanted to be sure I'd be okay. So he worked with a social worker and after so many different families he found my parents. They already had three kids, my two sisters and brother, and they were open to fostering or adopting. They really clicked and dad knew they were people who would give me a good life. All three of my parents grew close before my first dad died. He made a box of letters, videos and other little things for me, like his watch and that was supposed to keep me connected to him. My parents always let me access that stuff and I kept some of the letters in my room.

18 months ago a few of the letters went missing and I thought I'd lost them. I freaked but my parents had copies. Then 6 months ago I found my sister (20) destroying the copies. We fought and she admitted she did the same thing before too. She said she hated that I held onto them so much and clung to that part of my life. She said I was meant to be their son/brother and instead I chased after a dead guy. I screamed that I wouldn't exist without that dead guy and if it wasn't for him, I never would have ended up with him. My parents weren't home but dad came home to us screaming at each other. He stepped in and he kicked my sister out when he learned what she'd done. When my mom got home my parents admitted to me that they only ever gave me copies of the letters and stuff and the originals were all kept safe by them. They said a houseful of kids never felt like the safest place to have them out in the open and copies felt safest. Knowing the original ones my first dad actually wrote and made were still there was the best feeling. My parents were furious with my sister. I'm still not speaking to her. They're still mad but she's their daughter and I told them they don't need to stop talking to her too but to please respect I can't be around her, which they do.

My parents got a lot of crap for letting me stay home but my grandparents also told me how wrong I was. They said I'm not giving my sister a chance to make things right and I should be more understanding given the emotions involved in adoptive families. They said what I did was worse than what my sister did.

My Shanghai businessman father has more money than my husband can ever have. When my parents died they leave me inheritance. Including a house in China. I do not want to work because I have my Shanghai businessman father inheritance money.

And if my husband drop his pride and ego and would let me use my inheritance money to help his mom, but No, the ""man"" him must do it ALL without the need of a woman penny.

I didn't come here for a job question, I come here for the MIL question.

=================

Sorry, English is my third language. Married 12 years, no kids.

I have a complicate situation, so please read all this so you can get a FAIR picture on all parties (my husband, me and his mom).

AITA for want my husband to balance between me and his mom? And want my husband to spend more time with me?

Situation is his mom whom old and had a stroke 4 years ago that leave her paralyze. For the past 4 years he use majority of his income to pay for her Private Nursing home so she can get the best quality care as well as a team of nurses care for her around the clock full time.

It NOT about the money, but it about he has to work 80 hours a week. He gone 12 hours a day at work. Which means less time to spend with me.

Also this is what bother me the most.

First of all his mom has a team of nurses that care for her, he pay load of money for that, the nurses can take her to her Dialysis 4x times a week. But No, his mom wants it must be her son, as his mom want to spend more time with her son.

Understandable, but each time Dialysis process is 5 hours, and 4x times a week that means 20 hours a week he gives to his mom. In ADDITION to him work 80 hours a week. So that 100 hours a week of his time total gone from me.

Let me show you his schedule so you see what I mean.

He work 8PM to 8AM, that is 12 hours a day.  
Home he take a quick shower and eat a bit, then he sleeps from 9AM to 1PM that is 4 hours sleep, and I do sleep with him.  
Then 1PM to 6PM he takes his paralyze mother to Dialysis process.  
6PM back he barely has 2 hours rest then 8PM he off to work again.  
Rise repeat.

In all fairness, he only take her to Dialysis 4x times a week, so he does have 3 days where he not take her so he will have that 5 hours from not take her, and I do let him sleep more on those days as I know he tired.

What do I want? I want him not to take her to Dialysis, but let the nurses does. I want him to say No to his mom on the Dialysis.  
He can visit her everyday at Nursing home if that what she wish, but he CANNOT just sit with her for FIVE hours straight of Dialysis, and it 4x times per week. While he has to work 80 HOURS a week.

Also, in addition, 2 days per month is she in our home where my husband care for her 24/7 on that 2 days she with us, so he also take out 2 more days give to her, in addition to all of that above.

In all fairness, doctors said his mom estimate to have 2 years left to live. BUT this has been going on for 4 years already since she had her stroke, so 2 more years it be 6 years total.

I endure this for the past 4 years already, he not spending enough time with me. I will continue endure for 2 more years out of love him.

No, I Not want his mom  to die, but I ask myself the question, what if 2 more years she still here, and 2 more years, and another 2 more years. How long will this go on, when is enough? When will he find a balance between me and his mom, and also take care of his health too.",No A-holes here,2024-08-21,"AITA for want my husband to spend more time with me? Complicate situation regarding his mom. OK since I was ask the job question. I didn't come here for a job AITA question, I come here for a MIL question. But I will answer here.

Lol Now I will answer the job question, I didn't see the need to answer as I did not come here for that.

My Shanghai businessman father has more money than my husband can ever have. When my parents died they leave me inheritance. Including a house in China. I do not want to work because I have my Shanghai businessman father inheritance money.

And if my husband drop his pride and ego and would let me use my inheritance money to help his mom, but No, the ""man"" him must do it ALL without the need of a woman penny.

I didn't come here for a job question, I come here for the MIL question.

=================

Sorry, English is my third language. Married 12 years, no kids.

I have a complicate situation, so please read all this so you can get a FAIR picture on all parties (my husband, me and his mom).

AITA for want my husband to balance between me and his mom? And want my husband to spend more time with me?

Situation is his mom whom old and had a stroke 4 years ago that leave her paralyze. For the past 4 years he use majority of his income to pay for her Private Nursing home so she can get the best quality care as well as a team of nurses care for her around the clock full time.

It NOT about the money, but it about he has to work 80 hours a week. He gone 12 hours a day at work. Which means less time to spend with me.

Also this is what bother me the most.

First of all his mom has a team of nurses that care for her, he pay load of money for that, the nurses can take her to her Dialysis 4x times a week. But No, his mom wants it must be her son, as his mom want to spend more time with her son.

Understandable, but each time Dialysis process is 5 hours, and 4x times a week that means 20 hours a week he gives to his mom. In ADDITION to him work 80 hours a week. So that 100 hours a week of his time total gone from me.

My younger brother (20m) moved in with me around thanksgiving. I told him not to worry about rent or bills for the first couple months as he was still finding a job and trying to get back on his feet after dropping out of school. Months go by and he finally finds a job. It takes awhile but he eventually starts paying me for the bills and rent. He‚Äôs been late to pay me or won‚Äôt pay me at all multiple times due to him being fired or quitting jobs. He‚Äôs been through 5 jobs in 7 months and can‚Äôt seem to hang on to one.

My brother had lost yet another job and didn‚Äôt tell me for three weeks. He was completely avoiding me or would straight up leave me on opened when I asked about the money for the bills. This is extremely frustrating because I was never home enough to talk to him in person. I had assumed since he wasn‚Äôt working and couldn‚Äôt pay me for the bills he would at least use his time to look for another job or clean up around the house. That unfortunately is not the case. I come home to dishes all in the sink, dirty pans still on the stove, trash everywhere and plates and cups all over the house from when he has friends over while I‚Äôm working.

 It feels wrong to yell at him about getting his shit together since I‚Äôm not his mom and I shouldn‚Äôt have to tell a grown man to clean up after himself and to get a job instead of smoking in the basement with his friends all day. I had finally had enough and told him that event though he‚Äôs family no one other than me would put up with constantly being lied to about money and straight up not paying bills.

I am still working (as a cleaner) and the customers I have left are very understanding and have no issues if I have to take some days off. This job is not great for my body, but as my body right now is very unreliable most jobs are out of the question. I'm slowly trying to set up as a freelance translator (which is what I studied), but this is taking time to build up. 
Then there's my mom (58), most times she seems to understand perfectly well, as she also has chronic issues, but sometimes she is so unempathetic that just genuenly makes me angry. 
Sometimes I will tell her that I did nothing that day as I was in a flare up and she responds dismisibly with a ""yeah, right"", as if I'm using an excuse and that the infernal pain I'm in is nothing. Last time she did this was on Saturday. 
Today I told her that one of my cleans has dropped me, as they are moving to another country, but that is okey as is a very small clean, and doesn't provide that much money and she responded with ""time to find another job"". Maybe I overreacted, but I phoned her, and I asked her in what world she lives in, what job could I possibly find that would be okey with me potentially not coming. 
She then tells me to find a different kind of job, to which I answer that it is the same, no boss is going to hire me (or keep me) if I keep calling in sick. She asked what will I do then? So I reminded her that I already have the goverment's institution backing me up in stand by in case I get worse or lose my jobs, that this particular job doesn't affect me much and I can take the hit. She doesn't say anything, so I vent out (and maybe this is were I should've shut up?) and I tell her that it hurts me when she dissmises my condition and when she makes comments like today without thinking. That I'd give anytging to be able to go out and do a normal job like I used to. She doesn't respond at all, at least she turned off the TV, props to her, she often leaves it in the background while we talk.

He went back upstairs and stared at us while recording us I think (his phone is pointed towards us).

Me, I‚Äôd rather let it slide and add coffee to it at work since there was no time to replace/fix it that morning. I‚Äôve worked in food service, and not being able to fix it right away/see the issue makes it hard on the employees trying to make the customer happy. 

My partner was then telling me how I was making them feel invalidated since I didn‚Äôt want to call the main store for them, because when I asked if they could do it (cut out me being the middle man?),  they didn‚Äôt have enough mental spoons to do it themselves. They are under a lot of stress at work so I understand how aggravating it is to order coffee and not taste it.

Later they said they added extra coffee and still couldn‚Äôt taste it in their drink. Very odd.

Our money situation is okay, but we do have bigger expenses coming within a year or so and I know my partner is always worried about money too so they feel they wasted money on the coffee which isn‚Äôt helping anything.

We don't talk at all tbh, the apartment has a cold feeling.

 The worst thing is they don't communicate.

No clue who he was. He stayed for 2 weeks which she didn't mention at all. Myself and the brother talked a bit but not much. Months later, he's here again but this time, he's been here a month and completely ignoring me. Definitely bc he heard some things from his sister and the other roommate I'm sure.

  
Now, I'm being told that one of my roommates wants to move out in 3 weeks (yay) but the brother who is currently here wants to stay and live here with his sister. I have some rules about roommates and one was that I woud NEVER live with siblings bc of prior reasons.

We don't talk at all tbh, the apartment has a cold feeling.

 The worst thing is they don't communicate. The first time one of my roommate's brother came, I just randomly ran into him in the hallway which startled me bc I work remotely from home during the day and I'm typically alone. No clue who he was. He stayed for 2 weeks which she didn't mention at all. Myself and the brother talked a bit but not much. Months later, he's here again but this time, he's been here a month and completely ignoring me. Definitely bc he heard some things from his sister and the other roommate I'm sure.

  
Now, I'm being told that one of my roommates wants to move out in 3 weeks (yay) but the brother who is currently here wants to stay and live here with his sister. I have some rules about roommates and one was that I woud NEVER live with siblings bc of prior reasons. 

WIBTA to veto her brother living there? They clearly planned this because he came with all of his stuff but I do not want to live with siblings and another version of her. Is that a valid reason to veto?

64,1exq7vk,AITA For telling my SIL that I love my nibblings because they are my brothers Kids?,"Hi.

Last weekend we were having coffee with my SIL and 3 of the my nieces classmates moms. We are all kind of ""friends"". While I don't have kids normally is me the one that take my niece to dance classes and her performance/presentation and all the dance related things while my SIL stay at home with my nephew because he is still a baby and is kind of disruptive in these situations (the dance teacher is really strict). One of my niece classmate (actually her BBF) goes to dance classes with her and that's how I got close with that mom (lets calls her Laura) . And even if we are not like close friends we hang out some times and when the 4 moms reunite they includes me or invites me.

While we were having coffee one of the moms (let call her Olivia) actually mentioned a story she read on reddit about how a widow doesn't allow her kids aunt (the dead husbands sister) to see the kids because she doesn't treat the kids of her new marriage the same way. And she asked me as an aunt my opinion.

Well the first thing I says was please to apologize me because as I am not a mom I cant sympathize at all with the mom of the story but that I feel really sorry for that aunt because the other kids are not her family. Then I say lets put an example if my brother and SIL get a divorce or my brother die, in that moment my SIL put a face like OMG!!! (here I can also be TA) and look directly at my SIL and says: I know you tents to misunderstood words so I am NOT saying I want or wish that to happens I am just setting an example. The other mom (Nella) laugh and says something like: We know how she is don't worries this is just an example.

Then I continue saying that in a case like that if she remarries and have more kids then they wont be my problem at all and is not my responsibility at all to take care of them or provide for them or love them. Because my niblings are my niblings because they are my brother kids not hers.

Then my SIL ask me with a strait face: If its the opposite? Well if my brother have kids with another woman they are my brother kids they will be my niblings. So of course I will treat them like that. And I asked her: Like you mentioned if its the opposite do you expect your 3 sisters to love or provide or whatever for the kids my brother has with another woman? If looks could k\*ll I would be in funeral right now. Since my SIL sisters don't even care for my niblings right now.

And then all the other 3 moms agree with me Olivia even says that her sister is married with a man with 2 kids and since in 5 years she had only met them like twice a year she doesn't even consider them niblings. And we just stayed for like an extra hour. But the rest of the time you could see my SIL was upset.

So AITA?

65,1exq20g,AITA for refusing to make my dad a sandwich?,"For context: I (F19) currently live with my parents, and am on my way out for college, in search of an apartment. Since I live in Germany, dorms are not a very common thing.
My mother found an apartment near my school and has made a viewing appointment with the landlord to take a look at the property. I didn't ask her to search for an apartment for me, since I do that myself already, but I appreciate the help nonetheless.

My mother insisted she'd join me for the viewing since it's my very first, and suggested my dad to come as well. My dad works all day and is generally very busy, so I told her that that wouldn't be necessary, yet my dad agreed later this week to come as well.

Fast forward to today (day of the viewing) and me sitting in my room working on some freelance commissions I do for side-cash here and there as a ""job"". My mother enters my room unannounced and demands I make my father a sandwich because, quote: ""He hadn't had lunch yet and is rushing to make it for the viewing"".
I get fairly annoyed at that for three reasons:
1) I know for a fact my dad didn't ask for a sandwich, my mother just assumes he wants one. He never asked my mom for a sandwich nor me.
2) She walked up to the third floor of our house (kitchen is down in the first) just to tell me to make him a sandwich??
3) last time I made him a sandwich for lunch after work, he didn't eat it and made one himself.

Now don't get me wrong, I'd gladly make him lunch if he himself had asked me beforehand, it's the principle of my mom asking me without him even asking in the first place.

So I tell her that he is a grown man and is perfectly capable of making himself a sandwich if he wants one. 
Big mistake. 
She starts insulting and screaming at me, calling me an entitled ungrateful brat who wouldn't make her dear old dad a sandwich, after he got himself into such a hurry just for ME and MY viewing. Remind you, I specifically told both of them that he shouldn't rush himself for this viewing, it was his choice to come (which I also appreciate tho).
I get more pissy at that and blurt out a ""fine, I'll make him his damn sandwich"", to which she blows up in my face and threatens to cancel the viewing with the landlord.
I have no way of contacting the landlord myself, so she basically cornered me with that.

After that she demanded an apology and wouldn't accept any of my reasons for my reaction to her request, also not accepting any apology. 

She still treats me like a child and won't have a normal discussion with me as to why exactly I won't make a grown man his sandwich.

I still feel like crap tho, since I kinda feel like an entitled brat now.
Am I in the wrong?

Bg stuff. My mom was a single mom most of my early childhood. She lied about my dad, found out she lied when I was 7 which really hurt.

My dad died before he could get parental rights to me but he had filed with the courts. He was only 20 but he'd wanted to be my dad. Mom wouldn't let his family see me either. Then the guy she was dating was over the kid part and he left. So then, instead of saying my dad died, she told me he ran once he found out she was pregnant with me.

There are a few other people in our friendship circle including my now partner, who we‚Äôll call Alex. 

About a month ago, I finally managed to ask Alex out, and it took a few days but he accepted. As someone who has struggled a lot with dating for identity reasons, I felt hesitant to tell anyone in case I got cold feet and decided to leave. Another reason was because a few days before that Libby dumped Ella for a boy in her new circle. Ella was very unhappy for a while, and although she doesn‚Äôt seem it, I can tell. 

Last week, me, Ella and a friend where gossiping on WhatsApp when I remembered I should probably tell them I was going out with Alex, before it gets awkward. I had forgotten however, that Ella may still be sore after Libby, and told her anyway.

72,1exojb6,AITA For refusing to change my baby's name? ,"My Partner (M34) and I (F32) recently welcomed our son Liam Alexander into the world. My partner's sister (Katie) has 2 kids (James 6 and William 4) with her husband (Mike), and he has a daughter (10) with his EX. 

My partner and I didn't settle on a name for our son until the day of his birth. I have always loved the name Liam, for its sound and meaning,  and was over the moon when my partner finally agreed to one of the names on my list.
24 hours after Liam was born our families came to meet him,  his sister being one of the first. We announced his name to her and her immediate response was ""Oh, I've always loved the name Liam, but Mike wouldn't let me use it for our first son! Could you change it? Maybe call him Alexander as his first name? Its sounds nicer!"" I firmly said I loved the name too, and while I empathise with her, we would not be changing his name, or the order of his names.

 I thought that was the end of it until she visited us at home, a week later, and brought it up again. The reason Mike didn't let her use the name is because his EX has a son with that name. I told that shouldn't have stopped her from using the name she loved. Those boys do not know each other, do not go to the same school, don't have the same last name and basically live separate existences outside of their shared half-sister. I also said she could still use the name in future, it's common in my culture and tends to serve as a bond between the kids.

For clarification, Katie and I have never discussed baby names, and we have no name pacts. 
The only reason I feel like TA is because Mike and his EX have a toxic coparenting relationship, and this understandably affects Katie. Katie and I have a good relationship but she doesn't talk about Mike's ex, so this is as much as I know.

73,1exo9sf,AITA for wanting a push present?,"Yes I also hate the term ‚Äòpush present‚Äô and find it cringe but I figured if I used it people would instantly know what I meant. 

I‚Äôm pregnant with my third and last baby, and I‚Äôve been thinking that I would like a token to commemorate the birth of my children and as a nod to huge physical and emotional transition that becoming a mother is. 

I don‚Äôt think that giving birth should necessarily be ‚Äòrewarded‚Äô by the giving of gifts (I am so incredibly grateful for my two healthy children and for this third pregnancy as it is), but for me, having a child has been by far the biggest transition in my life: more so than getting married for example, which we do traditionally celebrate with the exchange of at least an engagement ring. 

My husband, horrified by the idea of a push present didn‚Äôt get me anything after our first baby was born, which I was a bit disappointed with. Even a bunch of flowers would have been a nice gesture. After my second baby he did gift me a modest pair of earrings (they would‚Äôve cost no more than a couple of hundred dollars) which I was thrilled with. 

This time around, I have been looking at aquamarine rings in around the $3k-$5k price range. I was thinking I‚Äôd get it for myself rather than expecting my husband to ‚Äògift‚Äô it to me (we share our finances anyway). 
We don‚Äôt usually spend anywhere near this sort of money on gifts, so a spend like this requires a discussion, but it is definitely well and truly affordable to us - so it‚Äôs more of a question of where values are placed rather than a discussion of if we can afford it. 

When I showed my husband a $5k ring I‚Äôve been looking at, he was not impressed, saying that we never spend this amount of money on anything optional like this and that the next biggest expense would be our car. I don‚Äôt think this is true, he recently spent $5-6k on completely upgrading his computer setup (which in fairness her needs to use for work), but even more recently spent $5k to fly to Liverpool in the UK to watch the football team‚Äôs last match of the season. I stayed home and watched the kids (which I was happy to do). 

So basically the question lies on the value we put on this gift - he thinks $5k is too much for this sort of thing, whereas I purposely want it to be expensive and extravagant such that it feels special and unique to the occasion that I want to celebrate. It‚Äôs the sort of thing I want to wear every day and then pass down to my children and yes, I could spend $300 on a more simple ring and it still be sentimental but that‚Äôs not really the point of what I‚Äôm trying to achieve here.

74,1exo09j,AITA/WITAH For not going to a party for my stepdad who just beat cancer,"So my (41f) mom (61f) and sister (31f) had a party to celebrate my stepdad who is beating cancer. I was unable to attend due to a prior engagement with my boyfriend. Now everyone is hurt and upset that I didn't come. 

My mom had told me a couple months ago that they wanted to have a dinner with the family since my brother who lives out of state would be around and the date she told me was the date we had plans for (it was a fundraiser event and it was quite expensive.) When my mom initially brought it up to me, I told her we had plans already and could we do it a different day, the following day I already planned to be in the area for a reunion on my dads side of the family that had been planned months prior. I live a few hours away in the summer time with my boyfriend.

 I had spoken with my mom a few times and suggested we do dinner another night, and she told me she'd let me know. And then a couple days later my sister creates an event on Facebook and its an actual party. I called my mom and again told her I couldn't come that day, she reassured me that they understood and it was fine. It wasn't fine.

 We had dinner the night after when I was in the area and everyone was very icy and cold, my sister was mean and left early. My boyfriend noticed it too, but no one mentioned anything to me.

75,1exnxpw,AITA for suggesting my (F25) mother (F55) wears headphones while I'm driving on our roadtrip? ,"For context, my mum and I are on a family holiday in Canada (my brother M22 will be meeting us in a few days). We will be doing quite a few hours of driving over the next few weeks as we travel between cities. Most of the lengthy driving will be just my mum and I in the car, some will be with my brother as well. 

It's well established that my mum is very sensitive to sound and doesn't like a lot of my music - in her words, it actually aggravates her and makes her angry. She won't tolerate anything she considers ""rock"" (which is basically just anything with an electric guitar and drums) or anything with a bass beat. For more info, her sensitivity also extends to things like sport on TV. She hates the sound of the crowd and the sport itself (whistles in AFL or the cars in F1) so I've never been allowed to watch sport outside my bedroom when I was living at home.  

This morning, before our 7 hour drive, I asked that she charge her noise-cancelling headphones to wear them in the periods that I'm driving, so that I can put my own music on without bothering her. She flipped out (for lack of a better term) and said that my request was completely unreasonable, she couldn't believe I would ask that, and that she shouldn't be expected to ""isolate herself for the entire drive"". She wouldn't listen when I re-iterated that I never asked her to wear them the whole drive, just when I wanted to play music that she doesn't like. To be clear, it wouldn't always be music she hates, but I don't want to listen to the same 100 songs that we both like for the next 4 weeks. When the situation is reversed, I'm always happy to put my earphones in and listen to my own thing. 

She insists that I'm trying to dictate the car, and that for the next 4 weeks, we can only play music that we all agree on (that venndiagram is very small). I see my request as a compromise - if she doesn't like the playlist when I'm driving, she can listen to her own stuff. I believe it's insane to think that 3 people will agree on the same music for the next 4 weeks and that we need to plan for the fact that there will be disagreements. 

Why I think I might be the asshole: my mum feels that it's isolating to wear noise cancelling earphones and we could theoretically just listen to music we both like, I just think will be boring to do for the entire time. 

So tldr, AITA for asking my mum to wear earphones on our 7 hour roadtrip so that we can both listen to music that we like?

We have an agreement, if one of us ""make it"", and get rich or famous with our work, we're gonna share everything. Get a house together and start working together (right now we're living in separate countries).

Just now he sent me 3 messages back to back, saying :

> - Zoom?
> - Now he's gonna be afk for 8 hours because I asked him to come on zoom
> - And then he'll lie, saying he didn't see my message lol

It's 14:00 on a Wednesday.. I know what comes next when I say I can't, because we've had this talk about a hundred times before.

When I tell him that I can't and I'm working on my project, he always says ""my project is gonna make us both rich, yours is moving too slowly"" and things like that. Then whatever I respond with, he starts guilt tripping me. I really don't know how to deal with this behavior.

# // UPDATE :

I responded, and it went exactly as I thought it would. I said one thing and my notification bar immediately filled up with 20 messages lol 

Me : I'm working too, do you really expect me to sit down and watch you work on Zoom on a Wednesday at 2pm  

Him :  

> - Oh fuuuuuck offffffff
> - You haven't done any one of 200 things I asked you
> - You didn't edit my photos (I tried but he didn't like the results)
> - You didn't check out my IG stories (I definitely did)
> - You didn't hop on a zoom call (I did when he asked at reasonable times, but for some reason he always asks this at 2am when I'm already in bed)
> - You never once supported me
> - You said you've been watching a show for the past 2 days (I watched 5 episodes of a mini series last night, 20 mins each, definitely not for the past 2 days lmao)
> - And you say you're working when I ask you to come on Zoom 
> - I told you 1000 times that it motivates me
> - A friend would say okay
> - To at least one of these
> - When I ask you to come on Zoom all your excuses are lies
> - Power is out, internet is out
> - They're all lies (no they're not, I just live in a crappy city)
> - He's working he says
> - Yeah today of all days is your working day
> - He says ""do you really expect me to sit down and watch you work on Zoom""
> - You haven't once supported me
> - Seriously just fuck off

79,1exn7z3,AITA for telling my aunt about my depression?,"I'm (19F)  and I lost my father (43M) in a car accident a year ago. Since then, I've been struggling with depression. My mom (41F) was also deeply affected, and her way of coping has been through  the church. She‚Äôs almost always there, really involved in all their activities.  
  
I don‚Äôt have a good relationship with religion. I‚Äôm bisexual and felt really unwelcome the one time I went to her church. The discussion there was borderline hate speech, not just against LGBTQ+ people but also other religions. My mom keeps trying to convert me, which has led to fights, and my depression has only gotten worse.  
  
  
Earlier this month, my aunt G. (my dad‚Äôs sister) came to visit. We went out to dinner, and when I wasn‚Äôt drinking, she asked why. I explained that I was starting a new medication and didn‚Äôt want to mix it with alcohol. My mom was clearly uncomfortable and tried to change the subject. My aunt said it‚Äôs normal to feel depressed after such a loss and suggested I make a change to help me move forward. That‚Äôs when she invited me to stay with her as long as I wanted. G. lives in a neighboring country, that speaks the same language as us. I saw it as an opportunity, and we talked a lot about it over dinner.

  
When we got home, my mom was furious. She yelled at me, saying I shouldn‚Äôt tell people I‚Äôm depressed because ‚Äúnobody cares‚Äù and accused me of just trying to get sympathy points from my aunt making her look like a bad mother. After that, I started to withdraw even more, just going to work and then staying in bed. I didn‚Äôt want to eat, and I felt completely misunderstood and out of place.  
  
  
My aunt invited me again one week ago, and I decided to take the risk. I‚Äôm leaving this Friday to stay with her for two months. My mom hasn‚Äôt been happy about it. We‚Äôve had more arguments, with her accusing me of rejecting her solution (church) but accepting my aunt‚Äôs (making a change).  
  
  
Yesterday, just three days before I leave, I found out she‚Äôs trying to rent out my room. She posted about it in a Facebook group and has been talking to girls from her church. Legally, the house is ours‚Äî50% hers and 50% mine. The bills aren‚Äôt that high, and I could cover half if she wanted, but she hasn‚Äôt even asked. I guess it‚Äôs not about money; it feels like she‚Äôs just trying to make me feel bad.  
  
  
I tried to talk with her, but she refuses to talk about it. She told me she‚Äôs going to do whatever she wants because I‚Äôm doing whatever I want. She‚Äôs still saying I shouldn‚Äôt have told my aunt in the first place and that I‚Äôm an a-hole for that.

However, there's a side to Jill that has always concerned me. When things are good, she's amazing, but when someone crosses her, offends her, or calls her out, she sees them as the enemy.

88,1exk159,AITA calling my cousin a bitch and being mad that she didn‚Äôt smile at my wedding?,"There is a-lot of information to the story so I will structure it as best as I can. 

Background: I 21(F) live in a different country to my cousins, and my family goes to visit them every 3-4 years. My now husband 22(M) and I were in a long distance relationship for the majority of our relationship.

Part 1: Christmas
18 months ago my family went to visit our cousins, and I was very excited as my cousin 17(F) lets call her Anne. Anne and I have always been very close, from the time we arrived Anne was being very distant with all of us and hardly talked to me, which I found quite upsetting, so I tried my best to start conversations and interact with her. 

Due to my partner and I being in a LDR we liked to call each other every night before bed, and he will read me a bed-time story (yes I know I‚Äôm 21, but its just something we do) all the stories he reads are child appropriate, for example Cinderella, Bell, ect. Because I would be sharing a room with my 2 cousins, Anne and 12(F), I told my partner I would not be able to talk much, so every night we would say we love each other, and then go to sleep.

Now to the part where I call Anne a bitch, on the last morning we are packing our bags to go home, and I am getting death stares from my Aunt, Anne‚Äôs mom, I was very confused but went on packing. Later that evening my mother gets a text from my aunt saying that I am a disgusting human being and should never be allowed in their home again, and proceeds to tell my mom that I was having phone sex with my partner in front of her daughters?? We went back to their home and spoke with my Aunt and Uncle explaining the whole situation, where a told my aunt that her daughter Anne is a ‚Äúsneaky lying little bitch‚Äù, loud enough for the whole neighbourhood to hear.

In attempts to mend the relationship between Anne and myself, I asked her in January to be a bridesmaid at my wedding, and expected nothing from her on the day. I planned the whole wedding myself and had my bridesmaids pay for nothing and all they really had to do was take some pictures on the day and enjoy themselves.

Leading up the wedding Anne and I spent a-lot of time on the phone, and all seemed to be going great. On the day of the wedding while we were getting ready, she didn‚Äôt look at me or speak to me once. And had a frown on her face the entire day. The next day she complained to my Aunt saying how horrible the wedding was as she knew no-one there ( I had a small wedding with only close family and friends 50 people )

Now to the part where I think I am the AH, I have got my wedding photos back, and she is glaring at me in every single photo, I was absolutely horrified!! So I proceeded to crop her out of all of the wedding photos before sending them on to people. My whole family is now mad at me for removing her from the photos, back the really do look better without her!

So AITA for being mad at her in the first place and cropping her out the pictures??

Edit: The phone calls were 5 - 10 mins every night, saying goodnight, that is it. Baring in mind, there was a 12 year old in the room, absolutely disgusting if I said anything else, and inconsiderate. I think what of upset her was me asking her about her ‚Äúfriend‚Äù, she was 17 at the time and she would sneak out the house to see her 24(M) friend, and I asked her about it, and if she liked him, she got very defensive and said they are just friends.. the day she turned 18 they started dating - one week before the wedding :). There is a-lot of other small instances other than this that I left out because I would have had to type a whole book. With regard to the bridesmaid thing, the whole family was genuinely convinced it would be the best way to mend the relationship, but it seems that is not the case. I also did not pressure her into it and when I asked her she was very excited and glad to be included. I feel maybe she was grumpy the whole day because she still feels guilty for making up lies about me?
",Asshole,2024-08-21,"AITA calling my cousin a bitch and being mad that she didn‚Äôt smile at my wedding? There is a-lot of information to the story so I will structure it as best as I can. 

Background: I 21(F) live in a different country to my cousins, and my family goes to visit them every 3-4 years. My now husband 22(M) and I were in a long distance relationship for the majority of our relationship.

Part 1: Christmas
18 months ago my family went to visit our cousins, and I was very excited as my cousin 17(F) lets call her Anne. Anne and I have always been very close, from the time we arrived Anne was being very distant with all of us and hardly talked to me, which I found quite upsetting, so I tried my best to start conversations and interact with her. 

Due to my partner and I being in a LDR we liked to call each other every night before bed, and he will read me a bed-time story (yes I know I‚Äôm 21, but its just something we do) all the stories he reads are child appropriate, for example Cinderella, Bell, ect. Because I would be sharing a room with my 2 cousins, Anne and 12(F), I told my partner I would not be able to talk much, so every night we would say we love each other, and then go to sleep.

Now to the part where I call Anne a bitch, on the last morning we are packing our bags to go home, and I am getting death stares from my Aunt, Anne‚Äôs mom, I was very confused but went on packing. Later that evening my mother gets a text from my aunt saying that I am a disgusting human being and should never be allowed in their home again, and proceeds to tell my mom that I was having phone sex with my partner in front of her daughters?? We went back to their home and spoke with my Aunt and Uncle explaining the whole situation, where a told my aunt that her daughter Anne is a ‚Äúsneaky lying little bitch‚Äù, loud enough for the whole neighbourhood to hear.

She lived with my parents and I had my own apartment with my friend from high school. We lived an hour apart from each other. 

She wanted to take classes to become a CNA, but the classes were in the city I was living in. The class was for 3 months and my mother had the idea of her staying with me during that time. I thought it made sense and was a good idea, my sister even offered to pay my utilities which was great. I let my roommate know and soon she was all moved in. She stayed in my room and brought an air mattress. All I asked was that she clean up after herself and put the air mattress under my bed when she got up in the mornings. My room was quite small and the mattress took up a lot of space. 

She agreed and all was well for a little over a week until I started noticing she was missing class and sleeping in. I asked her what was the point of her staying here if she wasn‚Äôt going to go. We got into an argument but at the end of of it, she said she would start trying to wake up in the mornings. It eventually got to the point where I had to wake her up every morning because she would sleep through her alarms. She would also leave her trash on my desk, clothes on my floor, and leave the air mattress out. At first I didn‚Äôt say anything because I didn‚Äôt want to make her mad and I understand she suffers from depression. But a couple of days later, I saw more trash and an open chip bag.

I lost my CPR and first aid card so I scheduled a time to do that but informed them. I'll admit a lot of things were annoying on my end.

I got my background check and they cleared me to work which I was excited about it.. My first(and only) day they were supposed to meet me there but had other plans and were 3 hours late. I was put to work with children which I was happy to do but there were some glaring issues with the management. The paperwork for my employment hadn't been turned in, I wasn't in the system to clock in, my medical requirements for the position were not confirmed, my pay hadn't been established and I didn't know what my hours would be. I started working without having any sort of orientation or meeting before being put into a room with the kids. Staff tried to catch me up on things but they were trying to do their jobs at the same time. 
I expected a brief rundown of care for the kids but no. I didn't know allergies, behavioral concerns, disabilities.. Then one of the staff left but legally I wasn't allowed to be alone with the kids as I didn't have my CPR certificate. When a child needed to have their diaper changed we had to stop what the kids were doing to be near the other staff.

I recently became a game developer in around March of 2024, so this year. I have been enjoying it so far, but recently a Leadership member ended up joining our server and telling our staff tho ignore them and that they were just checking something.

For a little background I have recently had some drama with am old place that I used to work at. I had began working at WashPro about 3-4 months prior to the drama. When I began working, I almost immediately became an Intern Executive for the Communications Department. I had began to get sick for the week of my Internship, so I was struggling to complete things within my Internship. For my first event, I accidently leaked the format to claim it for under 30 seconds. I immediately corrected it, hoped that no one saw, and I got back to my day. I woke up in the morning to a Termination notice. I wasn't really mad, just a little upset. I don't like to argue back and forth unless I feel like I have to. In this point in time, it was too early, and there was no point in arguing.

For my second employment I was determined to not mess it up. I completed the phases within a few hours, so 1-2 My Leadership for Communications was one of my friends. During the end of my Internship she ended up resigning because of the presidential team. In the end of the day, 2 Leadership members ended up resigning because they were pushing them to complete requirements by Wednesday instead of Sunday. Eventually that friend began to ignore me, and now has completely ignored me. When she began to ignore me, it took a toll on my mental health. She had done this before, but this one has taken longer. Anyways I ended up not doing requirements, and was unaware that they would have let me go on an extended Leave of Absence as we were not told that we xould request for that during that time period. While some of you might tell me to just resign, that was not possible as they had a rule that I needed to stay within the departments for 2 months in order to resign. So I once again ended up being terminated once again.

Come to about 3 days ago, I got accepted to Communications as an Intern Executive once again. I had began to work on Introduction slides since I would have to introduce myself the next day. Not even 30 minutes later I was terminated due to the Presidential Teams decision. For some clarification, I hadn't shared the slides with anyone, and it wasn't going to talk about my WashPro experience. Once I got told that I am being removed from my internship, I opened a ticket and I put in my status that they should resign and to DM me for reasons to get them to respond quickly. I had also added my slides to my About Me.

After that, The Owner DMs me and tells me to remove both my slides and my status. I remove my status and I tell them that I won't remove my slides. Eventually I am told by another President Team member that they were willing to give me an internship if I removed my slides. I then ended up removing them.

Yesterday, the recently promoted Chief Staffing Officer joined that server and told my staff to ignore them and that they were just checking something.

94,1exhydy,AITAH for confronting a creep at the park?,"I feel strongly I am not the AH here, but as a survivor of childhood s*x*al ab*se I am aware I can be overly ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù to this topic.

I took my daughter to the spray park today. We got there a bit early so we were sitting in the car when I noticed a man (50-60) videotaping the children in their bathing suits at the spray park. Once in a while he would pan around to capture the rest of the scenery, but would always stop at the spray park, and I am fairly certain I saw him zoom in and capture some photos while taking the video as well.

When he got back in the car with the window down I approached him. At first I tried to be nice. I asked him if he needed help or was lost. He said no. I said, can I ask why you are taking video of these kids in their bathing suits? Do you have a child here? And his response was ‚Äúno no, don‚Äôt worry about it, don‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù I then got really short and said ‚Äúwell I am worried about it because if you don‚Äôt have a kid here, taking videos and pictures of other people‚Äôs children is never okay, and to be frank it makes you look like a p*dophile.‚Äù He then said he was just trying to ‚Äúcapture what was around,‚Äù and I told him I was taking a picture of his license plate in case anything happened.

I returned to my car and called my husband. We decided I should call non-emergency when I noticed the man on his phone gesticulating at me. A minute or two later, a woman his age came and talked to him, and then both of them came towards me and my daughter in our car. She came over apologizing profusely, but the man was way too close so I said very firmly ‚Äúget away from my child and put your phone away. You need to stay far away from my kid.‚Äù And then I said to the woman, ‚Äúdo you know he‚Äôs filming other people‚Äôs children in their bathing suits?‚Äù She proceeded to say they were evacuees from a nearby town that burned down (pretty big story here) and that they were trying to take videos to send to their kids about what they were doing. I said you have to understand that filming in this way makes him look like a predator and he needs to never do that. I also said that I asked him if he had a good reason for filming, and he couldn‚Äôt give me one earlier. She then proceeded to tell me he doesn‚Äôt speak English, but he was communicating just fine with me before.

I told them that I no longer felt safe having my daughter there. She then said they would delete the video, and they did so in front of me while she continued to apologize profusely.

It ended with them saying sorry and leaving, and me reminding them that they were very close to having the police called on them. The thing is, I have a people-pleasing personality, and now I‚Äôm thinking, what if this was innocent and I accosted an older man who has just experienced the trauma of a fire evacuation, and I am waffling back and forth between feeling really bad, and feeling totally justified because that behaviour is so out of line.

So everyone, AITAH?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-21,"AITAH for confronting a creep at the park? I feel strongly I am not the AH here, but as a survivor of childhood s*x*al ab*se I am aware I can be overly ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù to this topic.

I took my daughter to the spray park today. We got there a bit early so we were sitting in the car when I noticed a man (50-60) videotaping the children in their bathing suits at the spray park. Once in a while he would pan around to capture the rest of the scenery, but would always stop at the spray park, and I am fairly certain I saw him zoom in and capture some photos while taking the video as well.

When he got back in the car with the window down I approached him. At first I tried to be nice. I asked him if he needed help or was lost. He said no. I said, can I ask why you are taking video of these kids in their bathing suits? Do you have a child here? And his response was ‚Äúno no, don‚Äôt worry about it, don‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù I then got really short and said ‚Äúwell I am worried about it because if you don‚Äôt have a kid here, taking videos and pictures of other people‚Äôs children is never okay, and to be frank it makes you look like a p*dophile.‚Äù He then said he was just trying to ‚Äúcapture what was around,‚Äù and I told him I was taking a picture of his license plate in case anything happened.

I returned to my car and called my husband. We decided I should call non-emergency when I noticed the man on his phone gesticulating at me. A minute or two later, a woman his age came and talked to him, and then both of them came towards me and my daughter in our car. She came over apologizing profusely, but the man was way too close so I said very firmly ‚Äúget away from my child and put your phone away.

This question came from an argument I had with my gf, I was waiting for her for **12 hours** so we could play Fortnite or she give me an update saying we can't, I didn't play anything else as I didn't want to be in the middle of something when she texts me but I eventually decide to boot up MCC (Master Chief Collection) and finish Reach's story.

I finished it and a while later she FINALLY starts talking to me and I say what I said above, however she doesn't know that I was playing Reach and assumes I was playing some other random games with reach in the name that I never heard of until now. I am very confused and baffled at this because I thought since both of us are Halo fans and I have been playing a lot of it recently while trying to convince her to join me that I would not have to specify one of the most popular Halo games to another Halo fan, but she tries to make it sound like I'M the asshole in this situation because I didn't think about 2 random games that I never heard of until now which also have reach in their names. I try and explain how I'm not at fault for expecting a Halo fan to know a very popular Halo game but she is very stubborn with insisting that I fucked up by not thinking about other *""""popular games""""* and eventually tells me to shut up about Halo or she'll leave (go to bed), so I do and she says sorry (probably begrudgingly or not meaning it) for playing Gmod for 11 hours with her friends and not telling me when she sent me a screenshot of Gmod (no text) and now here we are.

* She always sends me random stuff so I assumed that's what the Gmod one was.
* I do not hide the fact I have been playing a **lot** of Halo recently and she knows that.

I (32M) recently allowed my younger sister (30F) to borrow my car without consulting my wife (32F), and it's caused a significant issue. My sister and her 2-year-old daughter came to visit us and our parents for a few days before she starts a new job. She drove from Phoenix to Albuquerque, about a 6-hour drive, but as she arrived, her car started making a grinding noise, and her AC compressor went out. Her car, a 2012 Jetta with 150k miles, is otherwise in good condition, and she‚Äôs always taken great care of it.

My sister asked if she could borrow my car for a few weeks until she got established at her new job. I drive a 2023 Kia Forte with only 3k miles. Since I work from home and only use the car to drop off and pick up my son from daycare‚Äîa total of about 10 miles a day‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt see an issue. I make the payments, and I‚Äôm the only one who drives it, so I figured it was my decision to make. My sister even joked about taking over the payments if she liked it, and I didn‚Äôt mind.

However, I didn‚Äôt discuss this with my wife before agreeing, and she‚Äôs furious. She just got a brand-new EV a few days ago, which she makes the payments on. Here are her concerns:

1. **What if her car runs out of charge and she needs to go somewhere?** My response was that she should keep it charged, just as I would keep my car fueled. 

2. **She thinks I‚Äôm giving away something I worked hard for.** I pointed out that it‚Äôs my car, and I have the right to decide what to do with it. I didn‚Äôt question her choice to upgrade her car, even though it increased her payments.

3. **She worries about our son needing air conditioning.** I countered that we only drive short distances, and I can roll the windows down.

4. **She believes my sister should get a new car instead of borrowing mine.** My sister recently survived brain cancer, which destroyed her credit due to medical bills. I even had to cosign her apartment lease two years ago, but she‚Äôs always paid her bills on time, so I trust she would handle car payments responsibly.

Two years ago, I lent my old car to my wife‚Äôs brother when his was in the shop, and she didn‚Äôt complain. But now, when my family needs help, it‚Äôs a problem. My siblings and I had a rough childhood, and we‚Äôve always looked out for each other. I‚Äôve always helped my in-laws without hesitation, but when my family needs something, it‚Äôs a different story.

After a few hours of arguing, my wife tried to get me to change my mind, saying, ‚Äúwe‚Äù need a nice car, and that my sister isn‚Äôt insured to drive it. I told her to get insurance before she leaves, which wasn‚Äôt the answer my wife wanted to hear. The argument escalated, and my wife eventually packed some bags and took our son to her mom‚Äôs place, saying she‚Äôd return the next day for the rest of her things.

When we gave the dog back there was no apology or concern aside from saying they would fix the fence that weekend.
This week the dog came over once again and at the advice of animal control, who we called after the previous incident, we called animal control and scheduled a pickup for the morning. 
When the neighbors called and asked if we had seen their dog, we notified them that animal control would pick up the dog when they resumed business hours, and they could pick her up at the animal control facility in the morning.

Then the police showed up at our door and told us to give the dog back. We believed we had contacted the proper authorities but the policeman said we should have called them right when we found the dog? He said that what we were doing is theft.
We ended up giving the dog back over the fence but not sure what we can do the next time this happens.

My sister (21) and I (30) (and 2 of my friends) attended an open air concert. Late in the evening we were siting at a table just talking and having fun. 
After a while we noticed a jacket on the floor, that the people from the other end of the table apparrently forgot. 
We looked around but couldn't find them anymore and at this point they had been gone for a while. To be honest I am also not entirely sure I would have reconised them since I did not really pay attention to them earlier. 

My sister picked up the jacket with the intention to give it to someone from security or a staff member before we leave. 

Shortly after, it started to rain heavily so we all decided to leave and go home. 
However we still hat to exchange our chips and get the money back... (at the beginning of the event you had to by chips at the cash table. The chips were then used to buy drinks and food). Since we all had around 20 ‚Ç¨of chips left we all wanted to exchange the remaining ones and get the money back. 
Due to the rain it got pretty crouded at the cash register so it took a while before it was our turn. 
Since the rain was pretty heavy my sister used the jacket as some kind of umbrella and held it over her head. At some point we all just forgot that we still had it and we ended up taking it home. Most of us were entirely soaked at this point. 
We only noticed it after we all arrived home and unpacked our car.
To be honest I did not think much of it since it was 2.00 am in the morning and i was just tired. 
And truth be told.. Only my sister would find a jacket with the intention to give it to someone from the lost and found and the forget entirely that she even has it. 

In the end I found it quite funny since this is really the kind of thing that can only happen to my sister.

The day after on Sunday we had a small family gathering at my aunts. We were around 11 people incl. my mother.

I did not think much of it and told the story to the rest of my family. My sister even chimed in and said how bad she felt about it. 
Everyone had a good laugh and said this is just so typical for my sister... 
My other aunt even jokingly asked if it was at least a cool jacket. (it was not. I think it's a man jacket and at least 2 sizes to big for me and her. I did not really get a good look at it and was also not really interested)


I have not thought about it since but tonight (2 days later) my mother called to tell me how disappointing she is that I told that story. Now everyone must think my sister is some kind of thief and how she has raised some horrible children. 
Then she apparently had it out with my sister who then called me crying because our mother told her she is a thief and bad person for taking the jacket.

Last year he started a new job & became friends with his coworker FF. I never saw any red flags. But then her boyfriend passed away from cancer & BF wanted to befriend her so she wasn‚Äôt alone. I warned him not to get too close. He promised it wasn‚Äôt like that.

One night they went to the park to play board games. Hours went by & I was getting anxious. I took a D8 gummy for anxiety & was accidentally high as balls. I was sitting in my car because I couldn‚Äôt be in our home alone. They pulled up & suddenly I was paralyzed. I was forced to watch as he leaned in & tried to kiss her. I flew out of the car, she left, he came behind me shitfaced, told me he felt confused, & I swore I would fight for us.

He continued hanging w/ her, promising me nothing would happen. One night I had to track him down & of course he was w/ her. They swore nothing happened. I asked how I was supposed to know, all I could imaging was them off f***ing somewhere. She swore she‚Äôd NEVER do that. A few days later BF & I got into a fight about it & he left to stay w/ family for the week. Guess where he actually stayed.

I was a wreck. I texted her out of desperation & I told her how much he meant to me, that I loved him, & begged her not to take him. It was pathetic. She never responded. A week later he broke up w/ me. Said I needed to focus on myself, learn to love myself, & he needed to be by himself to get sober. A few days later I found out he‚Äôd been sleeping with her. I was throwing up, crying, & my family had to come get me.

Now he‚Äôs gone to rehab & is completely sober. I stood by him as a friend & brought him things when needed, checked in w/ his family, gave them updates, & even spoke to FF sometimes. All that love, commitment & support, just for her to swoop in & take everything I loved.

He told me not to hate her, it‚Äôs not her fault, he‚Äôs the bad guy, she's a good person, etc. I‚Äôve tried to feel any kind of sympathy for her & can‚Äôt. She knew what she was doing & did it anyway. I know it‚Äôs shitty to hate her, she‚Äôs grieving. But I f***ing hate her. I‚Äôve been through grief & know how it fucks w/ you. However my brain is not communicating w/ my heart right now. Maybe strangers on the internet showing me other ways to look at it might help me not hate her so much.

We were catching up, as old friends do, but then he told me he wouldn‚Äôt live a normal life. At first, I didn‚Äôt think too much of this. However, he then proceeded to tell me how he had been struggling with severe depression and anxiety and was unable to continue his original desired career path in consulting as a result. He graduated college in 2022, and by his account, he only managed to do so because of the leniency that COVID-19 provided. Since the pandemic, he said he has been unable to interact with the public. He has worked some serving jobs as a waiter for very short periods but otherwise has been unemployed. He has been living in a tiny apartment in the city and has isolated himself. He says that he experiences actual pain from his anxiety in the form of sore muscles, which make it painful to run and even walk. He also stated having his muscles shake every couple of weeks or so, which he attributes to anxiety. Ultimately, what has me most worried is that he is continuing to isolate himself until his anxiety leaves his system completely.

103,1exf5he,AITA for Completely Redecorating Our Apartment After Moving In?,"
Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm (F29) looking for some perspective on a situation with my fianc√© (M31). We‚Äôve been together for a year and a half, and things moved pretty fast between us, but it felt natural because we both were clear about what we wanted in a relationship. Around the 8-month mark, he asked me to move in, and by the time we hit a year, we were engaged.

When I first moved in, he made the process incredibly comfortable for me‚Äîhe even bought me a dresser and other things I needed to make the space feel like home. However, despite his efforts and referring to the apartment as ‚Äúours,‚Äù I still felt like I had moved into his man cave. The walls were covered in Scarface, Jay Z, and anime posters, there were empty bottles lined up in the kitchen, and two entire walls were dedicated to his sneaker collection. It just didn‚Äôt feel like home to me.

I didn‚Äôt immediately feel comfortable with redecorating, even though he encouraged me to do so. But recently, after getting engaged, I started to feel more at ease and began making changes. I threw out, sold, and replaced a bunch of furniture. I also started getting rid of bedsheets, towels, and other miscellaneous things that he had before I moved in. I know it might sound petty, but his previous relationship (a 9-year on-and-off situation) made me uncomfortable with keeping some of those things around. While his ex never lived in this apartment, I just couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that these were things they shared.

He hasn‚Äôt given me any reason to believe he misses her‚Äîshe never comes up in conversation‚Äîso these insecurities are purely mine. I suspect he would be okay with the changes I‚Äôve made, but I‚Äôm starting to worry if I‚Äôve gone too far.

Tonight, after a conversation sparked by him putting the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù bedsheets on the bed, he said that I only want to throw out what‚Äôs his and that I forget this is his apartment that we‚Äôre turning into ours.

So, AITA for completely changing the apartment to make it feel like ours, instead of just moving into his space?

Edit: I want to clarify that the issue with the ""wrong"" sheets was simply because we‚Äôre going camping this weekend, and I had set aside an older pair of sheets for the trip but didn't get a chance to pack them before he put them on the bed. 

I would never throw out anything without talking to him first, and he didn‚Äôt seem bothered until today. I love him very much and see now that my approach may have come off as inconsiderate. I appreciate everyone's feedback and will work on finding a better balance.

My MIL can be difficult and overbearing, speaking over me and butting into parenting moments. Still, she cares a lot and has driven 3 hours here to help us. She has made meals, taken our kids on outings, and even gone grocery shopping. I am truly, deeply grateful for her help.

We have a 7 month old pup who‚Äôs mostly my responsibility. I have worked in animalcare forever and have is well trained; people never believe me when I say he is only 7mo old. He‚Äôs almost always with me. With my MIL taking care of pretty much everything else our pup has gotten the short end of the stick and has had little exercise or stimulation for days. I don‚Äôt blame my MIL for this at all, but his behavior has become a little more wild because of it.

MIL has resorted to yelling at him, tying him up or locking him up. He has been having stress accidents in the house and barking which is abnormal. We live in a very rural area and don‚Äôt have close neighbors, dog daycares, or walking services. My closest friends and family are an hour away. My sister will come up once a week to help. I‚Äôve mostly kept my mouth shut about MIL‚Äôs decisions on handling our pup since she‚Äôs helping us out, but I‚Äôve been getting really upset by her calling him ‚Äúpsychotic‚Äù, ‚Äúout of control‚Äù, ‚Äúnothing but trouble‚Äù, ‚Äúnever calms down‚Äù and other names. I started saying things like, ‚Äúplease try to remember he‚Äôs only 7 months old, everything has changed for him and he‚Äôs gotten no exercise in days‚Äù. 

My husband came home tonight and 10min later we had zoom counseling. My MIL insisted the puppy stay with her while we went down to our meeting. My husband heard me saying to MIL, ‚Äúthis is the time of night I would usually take him for a walk or play fetch, he probably won‚Äôt settle down without it. If you‚Äôre having a hard time with him please send him downstairs.‚Äù She called him a spaz and I made a comment like I mentioned above.

My husband later said I had been a major AH for correcting his mom and insinuating that she needed to take him for a walk after everything she had done for us already. I think it‚Äôs cruel to be yelling at a puppy who‚Äôs not getting its needs met. The whole counseling session I could hear him barking, her yelling at him, and it turns out she just locked him up the whole time rather than send him down like I asked.

He‚Äôs almost always with me. With my MIL taking care of pretty much everything else our pup has gotten the short end of the stick and has had little exercise or stimulation for days. I don‚Äôt blame my MIL for this at all, but his behavior has become a little more wild because of it.

MIL has resorted to yelling at him, tying him up or locking him up. He has been having stress accidents in the house and barking which is abnormal. We live in a very rural area and don‚Äôt have close neighbors, dog daycares, or walking services. My closest friends and family are an hour away. My sister will come up once a week to help. I‚Äôve mostly kept my mouth shut about MIL‚Äôs decisions on handling our pup since she‚Äôs helping us out, but I‚Äôve been getting really upset by her calling him ‚Äúpsychotic‚Äù, ‚Äúout of control‚Äù, ‚Äúnothing but trouble‚Äù, ‚Äúnever calms down‚Äù and other names. I started saying things like, ‚Äúplease try to remember he‚Äôs only 7 months old, everything has changed for him and he‚Äôs gotten no exercise in days‚Äù. 

My husband came home tonight and 10min later we had zoom counseling. My MIL insisted the puppy stay with her while we went down to our meeting. My husband heard me saying to MIL, ‚Äúthis is the time of night I would usually take him for a walk or play fetch, he probably won‚Äôt settle down without it. If you‚Äôre having a hard time with him please send him downstairs.‚Äù She called him a spaz and I made a comment like I mentioned above.

My husband later said I had been a major AH for correcting his mom and insinuating that she needed to take him for a walk after everything she had done for us already. I think it‚Äôs cruel to be yelling at a puppy who‚Äôs not getting its needs met. The whole counseling session I could hear him barking, her yelling at him, and it turns out she just locked him up the whole time rather than send him down like I asked.  

So, AITH for correcting my MIL?",2.0,0.0942317545413971,0,0
108,1exdx6b,AITA for telling my boyfriend he should get abs,"I and my bf (both 36yo) have been together for 4 years. My boyfriend and I met while traveling and he admitted that he was attracted to me at first sight because he found me sexy. At that time, I was not really looking for anything serious so just went along with it. I used to surf which he found attractive. He is also very sporty himself and works as a carpenter. So he is strong, however, he has a big beer belly which I dont really mind. He is healthy, he is strong, and can do pretty much anything. 
I have known from the beginning that he prefers girls who are on the thinner side. My weight swings from 118-124. Im 5‚Äô1. But im in perfect health and pretty much can do physical labor too. We both dont go to the gym but we love hiking and my bf considers his job as a carpenter a form of workout.

Recently, since i moved to his country to be with him, i found it difficult to do any exercises (ive been procrastinating a lot). Ive been down as well from having left everything behind with non of my original social support. He‚Äôs not also here often because of work (he spends a month away for his job and 14 days at home and so on). So im mostly alone in the house doing my remote work. 

A few hours ago, I told my boyfriend that im getting fat and that my belly is getting bigger, and my weight is at 123lbs. Ive been stress eating lately. His reply was: ¬´¬†you know i don‚Äôt like fat girls¬†¬ª. He added that it‚Äôs no surprise im getting fat because i have not been doing exercises. So i told him it‚Äôs rich of him to tell me that. and i said, ¬´¬†why don‚Äôt you get abs?¬†¬ª. 

I eventually sent him a message telling him that I feel hurt that it seemed like it‚Äôs easy for him to get rid of me if i got fat. I told him that his body was never an issue for me as long as he‚Äôs healthy.. That i actually love his belly and I will never replace even if he changed his body.

I understand his preference and he did tell me that in the beginning but i feel like he could‚Äôve said something different if he wants me to lose weight.

111,1exczb1,AITAH for not refusing my brother's visit?,"This is a throwaway account. English isn't my native language, so please excuse any mistakes.

Last Wednesday, my (29f) family's cat died. She had been ill for weeks & despite every effort, it was clear she wouldn‚Äôt make it. My mom and my brother (14) were in denial until the end, so her passing came as a shock to them.

I never had a close bond with her & wasn't as affected by her death. She was very close to my brother, though & losing her meant losing his only friend. 

My mom asked me to visit asap to help them (mostly my brother) through the first week of mourning as this also was the first time without a pet in nearly 30 years for her & a trauma trigger. 
While I love my family & want to be there for them, the thought of dealing with this gave me a lot of anxiety as I struggle with handling intense emotions (autist here).
I'm also not in a good place myself. Money & time have been really tight. I didn't have any time to decompress so far.

I suggested they visit us instead, & stay in a nearby BnB as my mom had been planning for the last year anyway since we don't have much space, but she declined. It would've been overall cheaper than me buying last minute train tickets & more flexible to plan.
Despite everything, I agreed to visit by Tuesday, even though it would exhaust my last savings & require about 10 hours of traveling (I live across the country).

Then last night, my mom texted me it might be better if I stayed home, as my brother had a really hard time saying goodbye last summer after staying with us for a month & becoming depressed bc of it. 
I thought that was the end of it. Nope.

Later today, I get a text from her just saying, ""I'll bring him over now."" I call her & she explains since I offered for them to visit, they decided to bring my brother over instead. They'd left an hour ago & planned to pick him up in two weeks. BUT if I didn't want to, they'd turn around.

I agreed to let him stay because I don't want him to suffer more. But I'm upset, confused, and feel like my boundaries have been violated severely. My mom has never done anything like this before. It's 3 am now, and my brother is sleeping on the hard couch since we don't have anywhere else for him to sleep.
The whole evening was a disaster & we couldn't sleep because of it. My hubby has to leave for work in an hour.
I despise last-minute changes, unannounced visits, or calls. Anything unpredictable gives me a meltdown, resulting in paralysis & high anxiety. But I can't release the pressure since my brother is here. I can't unmask, and the stress just keeps building up. I don't know what to do or how to act. I love my brother dearly but as a fellow autist he can be a lot to handle even without already struggling to keep my composure.

I'm at a loss and don't know if I did the right thing. Talking about how I feel only resulted in evasive responses. I don‚Äôt have the energy to start an argument  to enforce my boundaries, which I'm usually very strict about.

112,1excret,WIBTA if I inquire about something that I feel to be an exclusion?,"Throwaway - This might sound dumb but it's been really bothering me.

While trying to be vague as I can, there's a ""festival"" I went to a year ago which ended up being amazing and one of the best things I've ever done, I won't identify it because it's very niche - but it was very therapeutic in a way and despite a few hurdles and having no idea what I was getting myself into, it also gave me a warm feeling of belonging which I struggle with. I put it in quotes because while it calls itself that, it's more of a smaller group than what you'd normally associate that with and tends to get somewhat closer-knit. NOT a cult though lol I promise, take my word for it.

Fast forward to today, this year's thing is coming which I again plan on attending and I couldn't be more psyched. Well, aside from this one little thing.

So they have a social media group for attendees prior to the event, where you can introduce yourself and discuss logistics and stuff. As of right now most of the comments are just introductions, sharing a little about yourself and saying whether it's your first time, returning, talking about experiences, and so forth.

I do fondly remember a lot of them and see some new faces as well, so likewise I made a similar introduction post saying it was my second time, talking about my experience and the impact it had on me and what I'm looking forward to (similar to the others).

Now, there's one person I remember from last year - just like everyone she was very nice, I wouldn't say I connected super closely with her like I did with some others, but we talked a few times and partook in a lot of the same activities and as far as I know there was no negative interaction ever (there was almost zero negative energy at this thing honestly).

Now, while she was very active in the social media group - I noticed she had commented on literally **every single intro post but mine**. Like something along the lines of ""looking forward to meeting you"" if they were new or someone she hadn't met, or ""look forward to seeing you again!"" if they were returning (all genuine wildly varying comments, not like copypasted). Not a word on mine which I thought was odd, since she clearly would remember me. Also according to social media she did see my post.

And yes I know this is just one person and I shouldn't let this get to me, but it does feel a little bit sus - and this is generally a community that encourages inclusion and love, so I'd be lying if I said it didn't hurt a bit.

Now I also don't know if it's worth opening up and I'm sure in most cases it would be said to leave it alone, but another thing that's heavily encouraged here is emotional vulnerability and transparency, even if it's something that's bothering you, like if you feel violated or excluded or something - so part of me feels like I should address this in some way. Obviously not publicly, but I am considering it.

So in 2022, I was having the worst year of my life. Marie and my other best friend, we'll name her Becca, were there for me in ways I couldn't thank them enough for. 

Our relationships grew immensely during this time being each others support. 

2023 comes and I now live an hour from Marie and Becca is 30-40min ish away. Being separated obviously makes the friendship a little more difficult. 

February 2023 comes and Marie and I help celebrate Becca's birthday. Mine comes along and I planned for Marie, Becca, and more to show up for brunch, have a girls day, and stay the night at me and my boyfriend's house. (He would be visiting his parents so we had the house to ourselves)
Birthdays are very important to me especially this one because it was my golden birthday. At first everyone was in saying how excited we all were to see each other! The morning of my birthday, I got a bunch of phone calls and text messages saying that they cannot make it. I had this planned months in advanced because i wanted everyone to be available. 

This obviously hurts my feelings but more so because the two people who i was for sure would show up did not come. I kinda let it go but get to August of 2023, I had hit a boiling point. 

I sent Marie and Becca a text about how they had both been acting like we aren't friends anymore between the missed birthday party and just not texting or talking to me anymore even after i've reached out. I got a quick response from Marie and she apologized for her actions. However, Becca never responded. 

Becca and I are closer than me and Marie are so this hurt like a legit breakup. She ghosted me and when i tried to call her to talk she didn't pick up. HER MOTHER TEXTED ME and said ""Hey Becca was so heartbroken by your text and I just want to give you context"" She legit had a lot of stuff going on at the time so i'm sure the last thing she wanted to hear was me bitching about how she hurt my feelings the past few months. 

I sent her another message apologizing and that I didn't want to seem shallow or make her feel worse. ...still no response. 

Sept. '23, my boyfriend proposed to me! I SAID YES! The first person I wanted to tell was Becca and ask her to be my MOH. She told me ""Congratulations:)"" and this was the last time I heard from her. 

Look, I know not everyone has to stay in your life forever but when you meet a best friend after not having one who felt like your person, and they talk about how my kids will call her auntie, to just disappearing is incredibly disappointing.

I (F30) got home from work -8 hours- and my boyfriend (M30) was in the shower after work -12 hours-. We talked about dinner plans earlier in the day (nothing fancy just burgers & some leftover dip). I get home, do a couple things, he gets out of the shower, he lays down, I lay down. I laid down for probably 20 minutes & I told him I wanted to work on one of my hobbies tonight. In the meantime he fell asleep. So I got up, did some chores, worked on my hobbies & before I knew it it was 7:30 PM. Burgers were ready at 8.


This is where I might be the asshole. BF has to be up for work at 2AM. I lost track of time doing chores & hobbies instead of making dinner first. Now he is upset because I didn‚Äôt make dinner before doing house chores & my hobbies. & that I forgot about the leftover dip we talked about. 


AITA for not making dinner (correctly) before doing other things?

115,1exbwhd,AITA for demanding my(23M) sister‚Äôs(23M) boyfriend(26M) to pay rent? ,"
I live with my sister and have for a bit over a year. We moved together after college in a pretty high COLA area (San Francisco). We were able to make ends meet but we weren‚Äôt exactly doing great. Her boyfriend is pretty well off, he was living off his parents rent and didn‚Äôt even have a job until recently and when his parents cut him off.

This was a few months ago, since then he was going to crash at our place until he was back on his feet, however after he got a job, he just stayed here. Which is fine. I‚Äôm fine with him living here. However, he doesn‚Äôt contribute towards rent for the house. He covers half of my sisters rent.

He‚Äôs making slightly less than I am making and around the same my sister is. When I found out they were splitting rent it got to me. I think it‚Äôs unfair that we have an entire person in the house that‚Äôs only contributing half the rent for another person. I think we should be splitting 3 ways if he‚Äôs going to live with us.

When I first brought this up it started a fight, they got mad at me and said that they‚Äôre only taking up one of the rooms in the house so they didn‚Äôt need to pay rent for 2. They also turned it around on me.

So I‚Äôm a bit promiscuous, I have guys over pretty regularly, but they‚Äôre often there for at most a few hours before they leave. And really only on weekends. They think that since I‚Äôm having people over consistently every weekend I should shut up about them unless the guy I have over that time is gonna fork up money. 

I thought I was losing my mind because obviously it‚Äôs very different to fuck a guy in my room and have him out of the house before the sun rises than it is to have a new person living for an extended time in our home. 

I talked to my parents about it and they said I was out of line to ask them to pay more. I really don‚Äôt know if I am.

We are a large family of 9 living in the US, recently we have run into issues with having enough money to pay the credit card bills by the end of the month. I am the eldest son, and said that we should have our the other siblings buy something simple and reliable like a Honda Accord or Civic or Prius.

My sister is insisting on a Tesla, and said it‚Äôs unfair that I was able to get one given to me. I understand her point but when my car was bought money was by no means an issue.

My mom also insists on having all the kids go to a private religious school despite it being a strain on finances because she is insistent on teaching them the religion and that it would be better than what goes on in a public school. I informed her that things happen no matter where you go and it doesn‚Äôt make sense when the choice of completely free schooling is right there.

Essentially my mom and sister are both upset at me now because they say i‚Äôm trying to butt in when I have no say in this. And though yes it‚Äôs not my money I feel like our issues would at least be mitigated by following those two suggestions. 

Especially since I am trying to think long term, all the kids are planning on attending college as well as med school and the cost is unfathomable to support that many kids if the goal is debt free graduation.

118,1exboar,AITA for leaving someone who was mentally unstable?,"Hi

About 2 months ago I broke things off with my ex-bf. He has massive self-esteem problems among other things, probably caused by how shittily his family treats him, which have made him not eat or sleep well enough, argue with people, even strangers, about how he's a bad person, not accept his own achievements no matter what; I could go on.

I was trying to help him with this stuff as best I could (which mostly constituted of talking him away from times when he hated himself so much or asking him to get therapy or go into voluntary admission) even before we started dating, but it never worked and I felt like I was punching a brick wall. He always said how he didn't need it, or how he couldn't afford it, or how he couldn't leave his mum and sister by themselves, or some other reason that made sense.

A while before we broke up my feelings for him started to fade and I felt like shit for it, because he had told me how I was his everything and his reason for living and he needed my help to get out of emotional slumps almost every day. I tried to break up with him a few times, but it absolutely destroyed him and he begged me to stay every time and I caved.

After the natural stages of 999 calls and crying to my parents it got to the point where I started vomiting from stress over worrying about him and how I didn't want to be with him, and I managed to convince myself the next time I saw him to leave him on unambiguous terms and then legged it away from his house.

I still try and help him feel better about himself and try to be his friend, but he's gotten worse, not wanting to leave his house or meet up with his friends for fear of 'making someone sad', and every other conversation involves him apologising for no reason for 20 minutes while I try to calm him down and/or him crying at me, and I feel like I've really badly hurt him.

I definitely didn't deal with his self-hating thoughts perfectly, with consolation devolving into arguments often because I couldn't get him to see that he was wrong, so I'm pretty sure at least a good chunk of this is my fault.

AITA for leaving him when he was in such a vulnerable state whilst being the only person who could help?

119,1exbefx,AITA for assuming my dad thought I use heroin?,"I (18) just had a conversation with my dad (mid 40s) after he got home from work. For a little context, my dad can get very hot headed and when he is mad he typically takes it out on us, not physically just yells alot. So he got home and I was in my room when I heard him yelling at my brother (20) to clean his room (this was all I gathered from their conversation as I didn't listen to the whole thing). My dad then came to my room asking where all the large spoons went (I had just washed the dishes) and I said I didn't know because I seriously don't.
