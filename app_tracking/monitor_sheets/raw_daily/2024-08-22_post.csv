0,1ey8xor,AITA for being mad that my friend got my art tattooed without asking?,"Hello, I, (21, nonbinary) have a friend (Male, 40), who just recently decided to “surprise” me, by getting an art piece of mine tattooed on his leg.

I want to start out by saying I’m flattered that he cares enough about me to do it. Him and I have been friends for probably a couple years now. We’ve only ever talked online, and it was made clear as soon as we started talking, I was not romantically interested in him. We message each other maybe a few times a week, just to check in on each other, let each other know we are there for each other, and then continue on with the day. 

The only time it was ever more than that was when he lost his father, and his sister both, in which we got a little more chatty with each other, just so I could help him through the hard time. 

I am an artist, I’ve been drawing since I was 14, but I am BY NO MEANS a professional. I don’t sell my work, and don’t believe it’s anywhere NEAR good enough to be on someone’s body permanently. He’s made jokes before about getting my art tattooed on him, and I always told him not to, because I didn’t like the idea. If he INSISTED, I have a couple pieces that I would have recommended for him to be able to get tattooed. 

However, here’s the problem. The piece he got tattooed, was a piece of a personal character of mine. This character is what people would consider a “fursona” or “persona”. I use this character A LOT, but more specifically for vent art, when I’m having a difficult emotional time. 

The artist that did his tattoo, not only agreed to put my artwork on someone’s body without asking, but absolutely butchered my character as well. It looks….horrible. 

I’m upset because the character has a lot of meaning to me, and I don’t want a stranger I haven’t actually MET flaunting it around like it was some sort of tacky flash design.

3,1eyy97o,AITA for getting another cat against my family’s wishes?,"AITA For Doing This? (Repost because apparently this title wasn’t “creative” enough)

I’m getting a cat. My friend has kittens she needs to give away and I told her I would take one. I have one cat currently, but have wanted another one for quite some time. I struggle with anxiety and depression, and I got my first cat when I was in a dark place. She lights up my life. I guess you could say I’m chasing that serotonin. Kittens are very therapeutic for me. But… my family doesn’t want another cat. My mom is just against getting another animal altogether. We have three that pee around the house and she’s tired of cleaning the messes. My little brother doesn’t want another cat because the kitten happens to look like our family cat that passed away last November. He buried the cat and to be honest neither of us are recovered from his loss. He was 17 and we grew up with him. No cat will ever replace him. However I feel it would be very comforting to have another. My brother is not on the same page. 

Not taking my mom seriously, I committed to getting the kitten. I figured I’d be moving out soon and that even if she didn’t like it she would be able to tolerate it. Now, with my little brother calling me selfish and inconsiderate, I am starting to realize he may be right. I really want the cat, but I fear I’ll be an awful sister if I do.   

Edit: For everyone assuming I have three cats, that’s false. I have two dogs and a cat. This does make a difference. My dogs are untrained and my family refuses to take part in walking them. Yes, the problem is still there. However, my cat rarely pees where she’s not supposed to. ",Asshole,2024-08-22,"AITA for getting another cat against my family’s wishes? AITA For Doing This?

Hi all, Going to try and add as much information as i can without it being super long and without giving specifics.
I have a son. I coparent with his father. Father and I both have partners who are “ new “ to my son’s life. 
My son has experienced a lot for his age and we believe some therapy may suite him well. My outlook on it is that therapy is a lot and especially as a kid it’s a lot. I believe me and his father should go with our child alone to the first appointment, express our concerns, tell them about our coparent experience ( our time share history , how we go about certain things for him ext) tell them about my household, and allow his father to tell them about his household. After that initial appointment, then maybe bring in the step parents if the therapist sees fit. I mean, me and his father have been here his whole life and both step parents are fairly new. 
Me and my husband and others i’ve asked think what me and my husband suggested works best for the child so they won’t be so intimidated at first. His father and his wife however, are viewing it completely different.. made a weird remark about it isn’t therapy for us . Which never made sense as all i ever suggested was we go alone  with our child to the appointment at first to explain how we parent / the households  then we can proceed with separate appointments where whoever has him, takes him. So AITAH for thinking that it should just be us at first or should the step parents also be involved from the start?

5,1eyxx5k,AITAH for quitting a game after my husband interrupted me?,"So long story short, my husband has been trying to convince me to play Ghosts of Tsushima for a while (pretty much since it came out) and I finally agreed to play it.

However, while playing the game tonight, he interrupted me during a standoff and I missed a game guide tip that came on screen. To be clear, I was in the middle of a stand off while he was watching me play, and as I'm fighting he asked me a question (not related to the game) and I got distracted answering him while trying not to die at the same time. I'm not great at processing multiple sources of sensory input at the same time, which is why I don't normally play games like this, since they require the player to keep track of lots of different moving pieces simultaneously. That's very stressful for me, and I typically game to reduce stress, so I just don't gravitate towards games that I find difficult to play.

Well, while I was fighting the enemy and trying to answer my husband's question at the same time, I missed a tutorial tip that came on screen and wasn't able to read it before it vanished. I honestly didn't even know I missed it at first, until my husband asked me if I had seen what it said.

I told him no, and asked what it was I missed, but he refused to tell me. I got a little frustrated, but it's not the first time I've gotten distracted from something right in front of my face while trying to process other sensory input, so I asked him if it was something important I needed to know to play the game, to which he said, ""Yes.""

So then I explained to him that I had missed that the tip even came on screen because I was talking to him, and asked again what the guide said. He smirked and said no again with this smug, teasing expression. 

""Are you really not gonna tell me even though I missed it because I was talking to you? Can you at least tell me what it was about so I can try to Google it?"" I asked.

""Nope."" He answered. 

So I closed the game, put the controller down, and left to watch tv in our room. Now he's texting me that I'm overreacting by quitting and telling me to just play the game and I'll be eventually figure it out. Thing is, what little interest I had in playing the game is completely gone now. I didn't really want to play it in the first place, but I knew my husband wanted me too, and at least the gameplay was beautiful and the story sounded interesting. But again, I play games to relieve stress, so now that I've missed important information I need to play the game, and I don't even know how to find what I missed, I'm just over it.

6,1eyxeje,AITA for not making enough smoothie for my sister’s boyfriend?,"My sister has been dating a guy for almost a year now and they live pretty close by so they sometimes come over to our parents' house to eat. He's a bigger guy and he himself has explained this is the reason why he loves to eat. I'm cooking the meals now since my mother had a little car accident and can't move around the house as much. Now my sister is staying over to help take care of mom and he decided he'll stay over too because he wants to help...needless to say he's just been eating, not helping.

He'll try anything and everything in the house so if I really don't want hands digging into something I bought for myself, I'll take it upstairs to my room.

At about 3 in the morning I'll hear him get up and go search through the freezer for ice cream (that we specifically left for my mom because chewing harder stuff hurts her jaw) or look through the fridge for leftovers. 
Last night I made dinner for everyone and also my mom's favorite dish: lasagna. 

Everyone in the house was aware that it was a surprise for her. When I leave the food down to cool and go check on my mom I hear someone go into the kitchen. And I know it's him because he has a very distinct heavy walk and is the only one who runs up and down the stairs. I go back downstairs and find both meals with a big ass dent in the middle. AND HE DIDNT EVEN WASH THE SPOON. 

Of course I'm pissed and go to my sister's room to ask if anyone's eaten the food. He denies it of course and even suggests that ""the heat in the oven probably made it sink.""

So after this point I tell my sister, who insists it was an accident and he didn't know. Again...everyone in the house but my mother knew. In fact, there was a whole joke that I wasn't going to be able to make it right.

7,1eyxcef,WIBTA for fiance wanting to not invite his dad and brother to our wedding / reception?,"My fiancé (35M) - let’s call him Ted - and I (36F) have been engaged for a little over two years and together for four years. 

Ted and his dad (let’s call him Matt) are not close. Their communication is a text around each other’s birthdays and the occasional holiday. Ted’s parents have not been together for many, many years and did not end on an amicable note. They have zero contact.

During the breakup, Ted was on his mother’s side and his brother, let’s call him Eric, was on his dad’s side. 

All these years later and this is still the case. The amount of comm between Ted and Eric is next to nonexistent.

When Ted and I got engaged, Eric did send a message to say congratulations when he was informed (months after). Matt on the other hand barely acknowledged the news (also was only told months after we got engaged). He never asked my name or anything about us or our relationship or plans for the wedding. I was hurt by the cold shoulder and Ted also wasn’t happy with the lack of a reaction. 

To this day, I have not met Matt or Eric. Nor have there been any plans to do so. They live 4 hours away from us. Ted’s mother, on the other hand, lives nearby.

Due to family issues on both sides (mine as well as Ted’s), we are leaning towards eloping or doing a destination micro wedding with only Ted’s mom and my father (my mom passed away some time ago). We do still consider having a wedding locally, but at this point seems unlikely.

Ted feels if we have a more traditional wedding within a 20 hour drive of Matt and Eric, then we must invite them. This has lead to us leaning towards the elopement or micro wedding idea mentioned above. 

We did want to have a reception where we live upon our return to celebrate with friends and family. Maybe 30 people. 

Now, Ted is wondering if we should even do that because he will feel forced to invite Matt and Eric.

So, the questions are..

Is Ted the asshole if he doesn’t invite Matt and Eric to our wedding if we do decide to have a local (to us, not them) wedding?

Is Ted the asshole if he doesn’t invite Matt and Eric to the micro wedding or something to that route?

My (19M) little brother Carson (15M) has been dating this kid Ken (16M) that he met at a wrestling meet a few months now. Ken has been pretty much out his whole life  even to his wrestling teammates and is a bit fem. 
Carson only  officially came out at school and to our parents when school started. Its been a bit tougher on Carson cause he's more into sports and we live in rural Missouri. He's kinda been getting a bit of shit at school especially from football teammates. Plus our dad isn't being the greatest about it as much as I try to help.

They were supposed to hangout Saturday after Carson got done with practice. I get this frantic text from Carson to come get him and I was nearby so I got there pretty quick and I walk into the middle of argument between Carson and Ken. Carson just comes rushing to the car and gets in all huffy. On the way home I ask what that was about and he tells me they got into a fight about Ken bringing him flowers.

I was a bit confused because normally he loves Ken bringing him flowers and seedlings because he actually has this whole love of gardening. Carson explains that Ken embarrassed him in front of his teammates that no one was supposed to see him getting flowers. He says he's already getting enough shit from them because Ken picks him up on his motorcycle and usually buys whenever they're out. Calling him Ken's ""old lady"" or calling him ""the girl"".

I was just like well Ken has his license and a job. He gets mad and says that's not the point. I call him an idiot and tell he's lucky to be dating a guy like Ken. I yelled at him that he doesnt get to treat his boyfriend like shit just because he cared to much what some assholes think. He yells at me that I wouldn't get it that I'm all artsy fartsy and never played sports. He tears up and just kinda shuts down and he's been hiding in his room all week.

10,1eywqqm,AITA for looking away when my boyfriend wanted me to watch him play a game?,"My boyfriend (m 25) and I (f 24) have been having a lot of issues lately.

Last night when I came home from work he was on the couch playing a video game that he loves and has played through over 10 times. I find the cut scenes entertaining so I enjoy watching them. 

He asked me to watch this one cut scene while I was removing my makeup and getting ready for bed, so I came to the living room. I brought my hairbrush so I could multitask, and brush my hair while watching.

After the cut scene was over he got really upset because he says that he saw me looking away. 

In the moment, I was defensive and told him I didn’t look away. But I probably did glance down for a quick second. I’d like to clarify, I did not have my phone out or anything. 

If I looked away for a moment, it wasn’t due to a conscious choice to ignore what he was excited to show me. 

We got in a huge argument over it, because I told him I think he is overreacting. He thinks I minimize his feelings (if you look at my post history there are more examples of this type of disagreement)

He asked me to tell him exactly what happened in that cut scene and apparently I was pretty off, or missed a significant detail. This of course proves his point. 

He slept on the couch instead of coming to bed, and now doesn’t want to speak to me (we live together).

My (24M) friend (24F) was in the hospital because she had high fevers and she always ask for money in the past, but sometimes I do it just to be courteous, but sometimes I deny because I'm broke and currently paying bills.

Today, she asked me if I can get her medicine while I was on break (WFH) and I told her I can't because of me being busy. She asked again with money and I refused due to the previous paragraph mentioned above. Then she asked me to asked my parents and I still refused, since I'm getting paid by them, but they asked me for loan, which I know that wouldn't work regardless. I did asked and as expected, they said no.

This where I fell like TA.

She told the nurse that she put my name under the care for her which set me off. I didn't agree to be her carer nor that I said I would agree to do it for her. I blew up at her on text because she took advantage of me by putting my name down for her. Idk what she was thinking because I need to relax and sleep early because I have things to do tomorrow at 7 a.m. and I need to rest.

I told her that she doesn't care about me and she took advantage of me for doing that. She brushed it off saying she does care and to stop being dramatic. I know the part about caring foe me is a lie because I either think she's either clueless or manipulative because if she did, she wouldn't have done that. I just put my phone on do not disturb and kept working.

I feel bad because she is in bad health right now and I feel like TA, but I never thought she would've gone to extreme measures to do something like this.

14,1eyvyag,AITAH for purposely leaving out my younger sister,"Me and my younger sister never got along. Anything I got she got the better version of. When I broke my first phone I had to work to buy a new one, but when she broke her phone her parents bought her a brand new one. Even on her birthday she got it better she got lots of gifts and a huge party applied by our parents, they decorated for her and because they said that they couldn't get her birthday gift they gave her $50 and from all of her friend she ended up with 90 something by the end of the party but with my most recent birthday. I was not allowed to invite as many people as her she was allowed five I was barely allowed three and just like the year before only one person showed up. 

And unlike my little sister I have to decorate fully for my birthday. And buy my own gifts/pick out and wrap them a poster that I had gotten with a friend and a sketchbook that I picked out at the dollar store with my mom. Even on my first day of high school the night before she had gone to her mom after our oldest sister said that she breathed in her ear like a dog she brings very heavily which annoys us but we ignore it. I made that night all about her when it was supposed to be about me she had done this on multiple of my special events so that there was a small chance I would be able to go.

 The worst part is we're not allowed to get matter we have a little brother who is autistic and at the table he choose with his mouth open we try to remind him nicely but when my little sister does it she yells at him any chance she gets she yells at everyone it's something doesn't go her way. Or she says cute whatever and snarky remarks like that when we ask her to do small things like unload the dishwasher. 

I have had some mental issues in the past and she knows this but she brings it up lonely asking random questions that I've already answered for her past that she knows for a fact send me into a spiral. So at this point we have stopped including her in Hangouts and had to keep our voice as low cuz she listens in on everything. Last week when I caught her eavesdropping about some new art supplies I wanted I got mad at her and told her not to eavesdrop. A couple days after that when I woke up the art supplies I had talked about wanting was in her hands at the table when I questioned her about it she said oh yeah I asked Mom to buy them for me even though she knew I wanted them really badly.

 This made me snap on her I said""are you kidding me you know those are the one art supplies I wanted but you don't care do you you only care about yourself you are a narcissist you don't care about other people and you only care about what you want and what you need in that moment"" after I said that she freaked out and went crying to her mom like always I wound up grounded and not able to go to my best friend's birthday this was important to me because my best friend was moving out of state the following week.


For the last couple days I ignored her at all costs even if she had asked me to help her with something I pretended like I didn't hear her and walked away because this really hurt me knowing that I probably wouldn't be able to see her until she was able to come back.

16,1eyv909,AITA for “making fun” of a friend who said that I discriminated against male doctors by being self conscious in front of them as a girl? ,"
I (18f) recently ended up in the hospital because I woke up in the middle of the night with chest pains and difficulty breathing.

I met up with my friends a few days ago, and they asked me how I was. I told them I’m feeling much better, but that I’m too embarrassed to go back to that hospital (it was a joke). They asked me why I was embarrassed.

Explanation: because it was the middle of the night, I was in my PJs, which consisted of a tshirt, pyjama shorts and no bra. I was in so much pain I didn’t care but after the pain meds started to kick in my brain started going “huh”.

I was in various stages of undress during my hospital stay - shirt pulled up so the very nice male nurse could put those sticky things on me for an ECG, and shirt fully off and transducer pushing on my left breast so the cardiologist could do a bedside echo (he saw how uncomfortable I was and tried to make me feel better) etc. Everyone was really professional and very nice but I started feeling super self conscious afterwards because at least  3 different men saw me without a bra on. 

One of my guy friends asked me if it had been a female doctor or nurse if I would’ve felt self conscious. I told him I would, but probably to a lesser extent. He then starts ranting about how that’s unfair to the male doctors and nurses that tried to help me so I shouldn’t “discriminate” like that. He kept going on a tangent about how men in the medical field live in fear of their female patients lodging complaints against them and so on. At this point I interrupt him and go “are you speaking from personal experience? We’re still in school, are you some sort of secret boy genius doctor?” 

The rest of the group laughs after I said that, and he gets really quiet. Later on he texts me to say he doesn’t appreciate me making fun of him when he was trying to talk about a serious topic. He hasn’t spoken to me since, so I’m wondering whether I should apologise for hurting his feelings.

17,1eyv8qm,AITA for getting into an argument with my best friend?,"For context I (16M) and my friend who we will call H (also 16M) have been best friends for years now and we have never had a proper argument before.

H and I have always did everything together, basically inseparable. But H really wants to be a ""cute"" model and wants me to follow him in that pathway. H suggested for me to crossdress in order to be cuter, yet I really don't like that so I disagreed with him thinking he would be fine with it like normal. However, H was pretty stubborn about this whole thing and got angry at me for not wanting to do it.

I got shocked by his sudden yelling and H immediately apologised. However, I was still overwhelmed from his outburst and got upset with him for just apologising rather than standing his ground.

H and I have always did everything together, basically inseparable. But H really wants to be a ""cute"" model and wants me to follow him in that pathway. H suggested for me to crossdress in order to be cuter, yet I really don't like that so I disagreed with him thinking he would be fine with it like normal. However, H was pretty stubborn about this whole thing and got angry at me for not wanting to do it.

I got shocked by his sudden yelling and H immediately apologised. However, I was still overwhelmed from his outburst and got upset with him for just apologising rather than standing his ground.

19,1eyuyzj,AITA for not allowing my aunt to see my grandmother in the hospital,"Last week my grandmother (66) suffered a severe allergic reaction to the medicine she was taking that caused her entire body to swell and was rushed to the emergency room. While there, my grandfather, cousins, and my mom and I have been visiting her daily and taking turns staying the night with her because she likes the company. Last night was my turn to stay with her overnight. 

Around 2 in the morning I get a text from my mom saying that my aunt and her boyfriend (45F and 32M) were heading over to the hospital to visit. This was a huge surprise because no one in our family has heard from my aunt in over 5 years. The last time we've all been together was thanksgiving 2018. At that thanksgiving my aunt's boyfriend and my grandfather got into a huge blowout argument that he instigated and entirely ruined our thanksgiving and the boyfriend stormed out of our home with my aunt cursing all of us out. Since then he nor my aunt have refused to apologize for that incident and cut themselves off from the family entirely, so to suddenly hear from them was a shock. We don't even know how they found out my grandma was in the hospital.

I let my grandmother know and she said my aunt is fine to come see her as long as she doesn't bring the boyfriend. I meet my aunt in the parking lot and tell her what my grandma said and immediately she starts acting defensive, saying she needs her boyfriend to be there to help carry the flowers and gifts she brought. I told her I can't let her in and the boyfriend starts cursing me out; my aunt starts crying about how she drove all the way from LA to see her mom and called me terrible for doing this. Apparently she planned on apologizing tonight with the gifts.

However, a few months before the wedding, Julia called me with some news.

Julia seemed upset but understood. She said she hoped I would still come and celebrate with her, even if I wasn't a bridesmaid. I took some time to think about it and eventually decided not to attend. I felt like my presence as a guest would just highlight my exclusion from the bridal party, and I didn’t want to feel like an afterthought.

22,1eyuobl,AITA for refusing to let my dad walk me down the aisle at my wedding?,"I (26F) am getting married in a few months to my fiance Alex (29M), and one major issue is causing significant stress: I don’t want my dad to walk me down the aisle.

My dad has struggled with alcoholism my entire life. Growing up, he was unreliable and often absent, which led to a childhood of broken promises and instability. My parents divorced when I was 13, largely because my mom couldn’t handle the situation anymore. After the divorce, I took it upon myself to try to help him get sober, believing that if I tried hard enough, he’d change. But despite my efforts, he never stayed sober for long. The emotional scars from those years are profound, and I’ve spent years in therapy working through the pain. Part of my healing process has been accepting that he wasn’t the father I needed.

Because of this, I’ve decided that I want my mom to walk me down the aisle. She has been my unwavering support, especially when my dad’s alcoholism caused our family so much turmoil. My mom made countless sacrifices to provide stability and support, attending every important event and ensuring I had opportunities despite the chaos at home. Her consistent love and dedication have been the foundation of my life, and honoring her in this way feels deeply right and fitting.

However, Alex’s parents are very traditional and religious, and they’ve offered to pay for a significant portion of our wedding. When they learned I didn’t want my dad to walk me down the aisle, they were shocked and didn’t understand my decision. They believe that tradition dictates a father should walk his daughter down the aisle, regardless of past issues. They also see this as a chance for my dad to show his care and make amends in front of everyone. They’ve suggested that allowing him this role could ""heal old wounds"" and bring our families closer together. They think I’m being too unforgiving and missing an opportunity for reconciliation.

Alex has been incredibly supportive and understands why this decision is so important to me. He’s been trying to explain my perspective to his parents, but they are firm in their views. They’ve made it clear that if my dad doesn’t walk me down the aisle, they will withdraw their financial support. He’s worried about how we’ll manage the wedding expenses without their help.

I feel conflicted. I don’t want to compromise on something that feels so significant to me. The thought of my dad walking me down the aisle feels wrong on so many levels. At the same time, I understand Alex’s concern about the financial implications. I’ve tried to explain my feelings to his parents, but they seem unable to grasp the depth of my pain, viewing my stance as ""stubborn and unforgiving.""

23,1eyuij0,AITA for being mad that my ex-roommate won’t pay the full price for a TV I left behind?,"I 26F recently moved out of an apartment I shared for 2.5 years with a college roommate. Early on, I bought a TV for $370 plus $30 for a wall-mount (unsure if we split the $120 install fee). I paid bc she had just bought an expensive couch. We agreed we’d each keep anything we bought individually that was expensive. We both used the TV & couch a lot.
We had a decent relationship, but she did things that bothered me: snarky comments, not cleaning the kitchen or taking out the trash, complaining about my friends, seemingly intentionally disagreeing with me in front of friends. To be fair, I wasn’t the best roommate all the time either, but I do think I kept my cool for the most part & didn’t retaliate much for those slights she made on me. Overall, we were definitely pretty close, but I don’t think we’ll be great friends now that I’ve left.
The new roommate that is replacing me is a mutual friend, but is much closer with my roommate. When the new roommate & I were discussing the move over text, she said 
Me: “… You mentioned purchasing the TV from me, which was $370 … let me know if you’re cool with that!”
New roommate: “… I don’t think we’d have any issue buying the TV upstairs from you, thanks!”
Additionally, my old roommate also said she'd “definitely take the TV” from as I was moving out, but we’d figure out logistics after the move.
From all this, I was under the impression that she'd be paying full price. Now, fully moved out, I get this text: “Hey! Can I give you $200? I found a new fire TV the same size for $280 & TVs really depreciate in value over the years.”
Another factor is that I just hosted her birthday at my mom’s beach house, clearly spent $$ on decorations (~$80), & never got more than a few snarky comments in return. While I don’t expect anything for being a good friend, I do expect fair treatment. Offering $170 less at this point feels cheap & not how a friend should act. Neither of us is struggling financially, so it’s not about the money.
One last detail is that I paid for the full month’s rent even though the new roommate moved in only a week into the month. The new roommate was moving out of an apartment with her ex-boyfriend, & I didn't see an issue with her moving in early since I'd be gone most of the month anyway, especially bc my ex-roommate could offer emotional support.
AITA for being annoyed about the situation & believing what they did was rude? Also, I haven’t responded yet, but don’t know what to do. Part of me is pissed & just wants to ask for the full amount since we’ve both been using it for years & been extremely accommodating throughout the move.

My brother agrees with me but thinks I should just ask for $280 at this point since that’s the price of a new TV, & she doesn’t have to pay for the wall-mount or installation of a new TV.

24,1eyuig5,AITA for having a problem with my partner smoking weed?,"My (35f) partner (48m) has recently rediscovered smoking weed as a way to wind down. He was a heavy smoker in his early 20s, then quit cold turkey.

My partner has been sober from alcohol for 3 months now. He wasn’t a ‘classic’ alcoholic in the sense that he didn’t drink every day, but he is unable to have just a few drinks and stop. Any time he drank, it would turn into a binge drinking session with him blackout drunk and unable to get home by himself. In addition, his reasons for drinking are indicative of an addictive nature; he drinks as a means of escaping his insecurities. He’s always said his favorite time to drink is when he’s alone, so he can feel good and confident when by himself. His drinking behaviour led to many arguments and was a huge recurring issue in our relationship. After many fights and failed attempts to take it down a notch, a bicycling accident finally led him to quit.

We’ve been great since he quit and he’s been super strong and certain about it. I’m extremely proud of him and our relationship has really benefited.

Recently, he has rediscovered smoking weed as a way to unwind and relax. Whereas I enjoy spending time with friends and going out, social interactions cost him a lot of energy and so he prefers being by himself. After I returned from a 3-day music festival, he told me he had spent the weekend smoking weed and relaxing, listening to music. I didn’t see any problem with it, since it was a weekend and I was content to know that he had enjoyed his time by himself (he tends to miss me a lot when I’m gone).

Since then, he has smoked weed a few more times whenever I have been away on weekend nights. There was one time I asked him if he had smoked while I was gone and he said no, but I later saw an empty wrapper in the bin and confronted him, after which he admitted that he had lied about not smoking. When I asked him why he lied, he said that he felt embarassed about doing it. I didn’t make a big deal about it, just told him not to lie to me again. He told me he just was planning on smoking weed on weekend nights whenever I was away, not on any weekdays or whenever he has any plans after.

Since that night, he has been smoking more regularly, including on week nights when he has to work the next day. Whenever I mention it, he gets agitated and tells me it’s not a big deal and to get off his back. I am having major flashbacks to when he was still drinking; it reminds me of all the times he said he was going to quit, only for his drinking to increase in frequency until some sort of breaking point/argument was reached. 

I am well aware weed and alcohol are not the same and I am not at all against either of them. However, I am worried that this is going to be just his newest addiction and that he will just start smoking more and more. I am worried for his psychological/mental health, but he gets so pissed off when I bring it up. Is my being triggered unfair? AITA?

25,1eyub8y,AITA for telling my bsf that my other bsf wanted to be her friend to keep his secrets ,"Backstory:I was in a trio with a girl(A) and a boy (P) they were friends since first grade but in 5th grade we started hanging out and everything was fine. Until they started leaving out a bit. Anyway that's a dif story 

P had a girl cousin (S) and when A met her they had a great time together and became really good friends. A, P and S were rll good friends. At some point A and S started leaving out P. He was right.
At some point they fought and didn't speak to each other for maybe 2 weeks.

Thats when P started talking bad abt A and S. He was into girls and boys. And he didn't want people to know bc he would get judged. A knew that and while they were fighting in the class gc she called him a ""little girl"".

He told me that we had to get her out of the way and that HE NECESSARILY HAD TO BE FRIENDS WITH HER so she doesn't spread his secrets.

I also had another bsf(E)and they were friends with her too.

Me and P fought and E also defended me and he called her my ""lawyer"".

I'm feeling betrayed ",TL;DR,2024-08-22,"AITA for telling my bsf that my other bsf wanted to be her friend to keep his secrets  Backstory:I was in a trio with a girl(A) and a boy (P) they were friends since first grade but in 5th grade we started hanging out and everything was fine. Until they started leaving out a bit. Anyway that's a dif story 

P had a girl cousin (S) and when A met her they had a great time together and became really good friends. A, P and S were rll good friends. At some point A and S started leaving out P. He was right.
At some point they fought and didn't speak to each other for maybe 2 weeks.

Thats when P started talking bad abt A and S. He was into girls and boys. And he didn't want people to know bc he would get judged. A knew that and while they were fighting in the class gc she called him a ""little girl"".

He told me that we had to get her out of the way and that HE NECESSARILY HAD TO BE FRIENDS WITH HER so she doesn't spread his secrets.

I also had another bsf(E)and they were friends with her too.

Me and P fought and E also defended me and he called her my ""lawyer"".

30,1eytflg,AITAH For not being close with my family? ,"
I’ve tried over the years to connect with my family. I’ve always found it difficult. From an early age I always felt different. I was very sensitive and it’s still something I work on to this day. 

Me and my sister have different dads and the same mum. I remember feeling jealous that my mum and sister looked-a-like. I come from an Indian background and was the only one with a Muslim surname and olive skin whilst my mum and sister are both white.

My sister connected more with my mum’s side of the family, given that our cousin and her were much closer in ages. They would go on family holidays together. 

In adult life, I have made family out of friends; moved cities; went to uni; started a career; got into reckless relationships and behaviours and now I’m starting over again. 

I’ve made changes since lockdown and for years tried to make a better connection with them. I do this mostly through the children (my younger brother, 3 nephews and niece) 

My mum remarried to a guy I caught her having an affair with when I was 11 - I was dismissed and laughed at by both my mum and sister, only to find out 3 years later that I was going to be moving in with a stranger (my mum made it out that it was just going to be her and I before my stuff was moved) 

This has obviously had an impact on our relationship. Plus with our family having that old army vibe still influencing us from generations past (Emotionally constipated) it’s kind of hard to be vulnerable with them. 

I try not to let it get to me but when I see families doing things together I do feel a loss. 

My sister and I are getting a bit better after I have spent a lot of effort trying to connect with her kids despite living in different cities. 

She suggested we go somewhere for my 30 next year and I thought that was a good idea. I created a group chat with my mum and sister a few months ago that helps when I’m visiting cos I often plan between them both. 

I decided to make plans for London. My mum has seen the messages and ignored. She also ignored my efforts to generate some support for my new business. It’s made me feel pretty shit. 

I dont have a connection with my dad’s side of the family either as he is estranged with them. Me and my cousin make attempts, but it’s hard to generate connection in adulthood. My dad is an old school ex-army, functional alcoholic/workaholic - he means well but I tend to keep him at a safe distance.

I feel really lonely as my friends are moving on with their lives. I live in a new city and stopped relying on drunk for socialising. 

I feel guilt for not making the effort with my family when I was younger. But at the same time I also didn’t feel very included either. Is it my fault? How did I fix it? ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-22,"AITAH For not being close with my family?

31,1eytbr6,AITA for fighting with my friend in front of her daughter?,"

I have posted about this friend in the past, but our friendship has come to an abrupt head this weekend. 

My (25f) friend Emily (25f) and I have had some issues in the past and I have had to set some ground rules with her because of the addictions that she has. She is not allowed to smoke in my car, both tobacco and marijuana, and I will not take her to procure these vices. She has shown that these two things are more important to her than anything else, so I refuse to be around it. A couple of months ago, Emily’s daughter Emma (6f) requested swim lessons but Emily refused due to funds. After arguing with her (and posting here), I ended up footing the bill for the swim lessons. While this made Emma happy, which was the whole point, it has become a problem with Emily and I, as Emily has made it MY responsibility to make sure Emma can attend the lessons I paid for. 

For the first three lessons, I was able to drive Emma to her lessons after Emily asked me to. She called and said she had an appointment (the lessons were originally moved to Wednesdays due to a weekend event at the pool, I have Wednesdays off from work) and I agreed. Last week, we were informed the lessons were moved back to Saturday. I work on Saturdays, as does my husband, so I informed Emily that I would not be able to drive Emma to her lessons anymore. She said that was fine, and everything seemed to be solidified that she would take Emma via public transit. 

This past Friday, I had a short shift at work and Emily asked if I could take her grocery shopping while Emma stayed with her grandfather. I said that was fine, and we left, but on the way back, we had to go pick up Emma before heading home. With Emma in the car, Emily asked me what time I would be picking up Emma for her swim lessons the next day. I asked her what she was talking about, and Emily said that she needed me to take Emma for her. I explained, calmly, that I had to work and I was not able to get time off on a Saturday to drive Emma and we had discussed this already. Emily, very upset by this, said “this is why I didn’t want you to even pay for the effing lessons because I knew you’d bail,” and proceeded to light a cigarette as I was stopping at a red light. I took her cigarette out of her mouth and threw it out the window before telling her to “get her own priorities in line,” and that I was not a chauffeur or responsible for this task. Emily yelled at me that I was a horrible friend to her, which I didn’t respond to, and the entire car stayed silent until I dropped them back off at home, where Emily slammed my car door, my trunk, and wouldn’t allow Emma to say goodbye. 

I recounted the ordeal with my husband, who said I should have not spoken about this while Emma was in my back seat. I just couldn’t help myself, and while it was not a great thing to yell at my friend in front of her child, I think I was justified in my response.

32,1eysynv,AITA for refusing to take in my grandmother?,"My grandmother is in her nineties and her memory is failing. She had a series of falls about two years ago and had to move in with my aunt, who is her eldest daughter.

Since then, my aunt was diagnosed with terminal cancel. She's undergoing chemo, but she's very sick herself and hasn't been able to look after another person, so they eventually moved my grandmother into a residential care home.

They sold her old house to pay for her care, but the cost of said care quickly burned through the proceeds, and she isn't going to be able to stay there past the end of this year at this rate.

Discussion of what to do next has largely excluded me, taking place mostly between her three daughters, but the options were as follows:

* Government-sponsored care home. 
* My mother or another aunt takes her in. My mother has large, untrained dogs that would probably hurt my grandmother. My other aunt lives in another country, and the logistics would be innavigable.
* My cousins take her in. They have children however.
* Me. I have a spare room in the house I rent.

Problem is, I work full-time, and I wouldn't be able to look after her and still pay the bills. I'm also the youngest cousin, the least financially secure, I'm neurodivergent and struggle to look after myself as it is, I'm currently in a relatively new relationship, I've just started a new job that suits me really well, and I'm basically still trying to get my life off the ground.

My mother recently brought some of the options up with me and suggested I volunteer to take care of my grandmother. She says the rest of the family that it would be the best option because I have the least to lose if I lose my job, relationship, etc. because of this. I've been told they would pay for her expenses, which I'll admit is generous, and they'd discuss also pooling money to pay for my rent and other essential costs if I'd consider quitting my job to look after her.

I've told her that I'm not willing to put myself in that position. I love my grandmother, but there's a reason why I don't have children and why it's taken my until my 30s to finally get my life together. I'm not fit for looking after another person. I can barely take care of myself. I didn't even get diagnosed until recently because my family didn't 'believe' in mental health issues and as far as they're still concerned, psychiatry is quackery.

Since giving her my answer, my entire family have dragged my name to hell and back, calling me ungrateful, selfish, and worse.

33,1eysyb9,AITA for telling my aunt she is no longer invited to the wedding that she payed for. ,"EDIT: My aunt, whom we were very close with, offered to help us financially with our wedding. She helped plan and fund our engagement party and paid for our wedding venue.
Things took a turn when my younger sibling got engaged and planned a wedding right before ours.(I want to make it clear that my sister and I are TIGHT) we are literally BFF’s and no one was hurt. She genuinely asked if we were okay with it. We said yes ultimately, but of course mentioned feelings of concern. She understood and we were all mature and moved on! 
The real issue arose with my aunt, who became extremely upset about the second wedding, even though no one had asked her to get involved.
She started acting out, cornering and berating my sister, even making her cry in public.

She genuinely asked if we were okay with it. We said yes ultimately, but of course mentioned feelings of concern. She understood and we were all mature and moved on!

My brother had a small birthday party for her at his home. I got her a bunch of things she’d specifically asked for (a puzzle, books, a squishmallow) and I also got her some stuff from ulta. I got her a sol de janeiro body set, 2 lip glosses in her favorite colors, and a mascara. I thought nothing of it and added it to the bag with all her other gifts. Especially since she’s talked about makeup to me in the past and expressed interest in it. 

Skip to the party and she’s opening gifts. She loved everything I got her and hugged me after opening them, she specifically commented on the lipglosses and the colors and how excited she was to use them. It was a nice party. 

After the party, my brother pulled me aside and told me my gift was inappropriate. I asked what he meant and he said giving a 12 year old makeup was ridiculous and he would be taking it away from her. I told him this child has a phone, social media, and is now in middle school and you’re worried about some mascara and lipgloss? He got pissed and told me to stop trying to parent his kid.

After one incredibly explosive argument I decied to end the relationship, however at the time I stated I would still be their for him no matter what but strictly as friends and we still kept in touch through out the years until 2 year old agos when you just lost contact and full on started to move in different cycles.

The high school lacked teachers badly and as soon as they found out she had a math degree people began asking her to get a teaching certificate. The science teacher who was retiring also taught math but wasn’t really qualified. I think they weren’t as well off then so she did went to do the extra education to teach. This is in a poor area without a lot of other jobs so it was probably her only good choice. 

There was a lot of drama between her and the other teachers mainly because she demanded what a teacher who had been working for like 10 years would normally got. People said she was privileged because her husband was a doctor and she knew there wasn’t any one else who would do it. She complained about cattiness from the other teachers due to this.

This year her daughter graduated and is heading to college and she told the school she wasn’t coming back. My son is going to high school next year and honestly I’m really sad because now even the science teacher is retired and she actually covered for the science teacher and there is no math and science teacher now and that means someone unqualified will probably be filling in.

I pointed out my child isn’t going to get the same and she just shrugged and said the school district would figure it out. I know that’s not going to happen and she just doesn’t want to think about it.

After trying to explain our perspective for about 20 minutes, (during which we were insulted with implications about our  morals and values) the fine was waived in favour of writing an apology letter, which we eventually did just to get out of the situation.

I don't know how he convinced my sister to finally give him the time of day but that's a story for a different day. Anyway, they've been married for 4 years and have a 3 year-old daughter together. 

I'm convinced that the only reason they even had a kid is because my sister has always wanted kids and she would've left his ass if he didn't agree to having one. The reason I think this is because he's outright said my sister is the most important person to him (even after their daughter had been born) and when their daughter was in the hospital he only came home because my sister told him she was scared and not because he was worried about their daughter (he admitted this himself).

I think my niece and sister both deserve better but I usually bite my tongue to keep the peace and because he has a way of always making the other person look like the bad guy in front of others so I knew I would get a lot of backlash if I said anything to him. BUT recently he missed his daughter's birthday because he went on a work trip that he could've moved or cancelled so since my niece is so young my sister celebrated her birthday twice since she wouldn't really know the difference. During her second birthday party he was completely unbothered and wasn't giving his daughter any attention (he was too busy watching my sister the entire time). I felt so bad for her because she's a complete daddy's girl and just wanted him to play with her on her ""birthday"" and he wasn't encouraging her at all. The only time he bothered to give her attention was when my sister was around.

Eventually it was just me and my brother-in-law and I told him he should give his daughter more attention and he just scoffed and claimed he did (he absolutely doesn't). I asked him if it had been my sister's birthday would he have went on that trip and he wouldn't answer because we both know the answer is no. I can't remember exactly what else was said but he told me to mind my own business and I was feeling pretty angry on my niece's behalf so I told him that he shouldn't be surprised when one day she was all grown up and hated his guts. I also said that my sister would catch on and she would hate him too which I think got to him more than the comment about my niece.

I can't remember exactly what else was said but he told me to mind my own business and I was feeling pretty angry on my niece's behalf so I told him that he shouldn't be surprised when one day she was all grown up and hated his guts. I also said that my sister would catch on and she would hate him too which I think got to him more than the comment about my niece.

As I mentioned before he has a way of making the other person look bad so he spun a story to my sister and now she's upset with me because I won't apologise to him.

the next day we went out to eat dumplings at a place id wanted to bring them for months. on the way there, my mother got upset at a ""tone"" in my fathers voice and spent the entire evening sulking and moping like a depressed teenager. it was uncomfortable and embarrassing, she ruined the night. 

now today is the only night in the foreseeable future that I can go to the movies with my parents due to my work schedule. its an added bonus that my bestfriend can tag along so for the past few days we've agreed Thursday night we are going to the movies. this morning she even asked me if my bff will be joining us. 

but now, hours before were supposed to go she says we cant tonight (because the movie is at 10 instead of 9)  the accumulation of the past few days made me blow up on her. my dad took her side and said he cant go if she cant make it which made me even more upset. but I REFUSE to let her fuck up another night for me this week so im going without them.

43,1eyqjf2,AITA for bailing on a vacation with my flatmates?,"I (25f) have lived with my 2 flatmates, we’ll call them Lindsey (27f) and Grace (24f), for almost a year, and we didn’t have any problems until about 2 months ago.

We were planning to visit Grace’s hometown in Macedonia to go to a festival in July for a while. Grace and Lindsey decided to expand on the trip and invited maybe 10 of their friends to rent a villa all together outside of Barcelona before the festival, which I was also invited to.

The day after I bought my plane tickets in June, I found out I got into an acting class I’d auditioned for, and I was so excited because I recently left my job to pursue more creative work and I felt like this was a breakthrough. Unfortunately, the first week of the course conflicted with our holiday plans.

I texted our group chat immediately to let them know, and asked if I it was okay if I only did the Macedonia leg of the trip, and I got extremely passive aggressive responses. “You do what you gotta do” they texted back, and Lindsey in particular gave me the silent treatment when I got home, not even looking at me when I apologized in person. I tried to apologize but she just said, “that’s not gonna change anything, at this point we just need numbers for the trip.” (They were really worried about how expensive the trip was gonna be because, let’s be real, none of us have super high paying jobs as I’m a freelance teacher and they work in publishing/are doing a PHD)

I ended up decided to cancel my tickets and not go at all, because (especially since I quit my job) I realized I couldn’t afford a vacation and a course, but I decided to prioritize my work over my plans with my friends.

But things in the flat haven’t been the same since. Lindsey was cold to me for weeks, and we never hang out anymore. She was upset with me because a lot of other people dropped out of the trip and only 7 people ended up going. They also said that if they knew less people were going, they would have chosen a villa in a less expensive country like Greece or Croatia because they didn’t initially find any villas that they liked that were big enough to host everyone.

When I dropped out, they hadn’t reserved a villa yet. If they had, I would have sucked it up and paid my share because that’s only fair! But they hadn’t…

Now they’re about to move out to be with their partners, and I don’t know if I want to reconcile/keep in touch. I’m honestly really hurt that they refused to talk to me for so long (idk if I want to be friends with people I can’t talk through conflicts with, I feel like we’re too old for that) and that they were my only friends who didn’t congratulate my on my course, which makes me feel like they don’t support me or understand why I made my decision. I feel like I could have communicated better, and they have every right to be upset with me for backing out, but I feel like their treatment was maybe harsher than I deserved?

44,1eyqf7h,AITA for reacting to a remark on my look from a friend?,"Ok so I need help and honesty on this one as my self-esteem has taken a bit of a knock.

Last night I was at a televised wrestling event. I managed to get ringside and even ended up on tv a few times. The atmosphere was amazing and I was buzzing. After the event I saw some clips with me in and also a gif - I sent them to my friend.

His response - ""you don't look good"". I was confused, re-watched them and think I look fine. Just happy. I asked what made him think that. His reply - ""bro seriously....moobs"". 

I left it a few hours and then let him know that tbh that kind of response isn't right. I didn't ask for an opinion. Its taken the shine off the night. I can't turn back time and change t-shirts. 

I explained that reacting like that can lose you friends - no one wants their memories tarnished and to become self-conscious. Especially over a 2 second gif. Logically I don't see the reason to say something like that unless you're trying to hurt someone. Because theres logically no other outcome possible. 

Anyway he thinks I am being an ass and over reacting. I think I need some space from the negative. Am I being over-reactive here?

But more seriously - I don't see it. Like I wear larger loose t-shirts for comfort but I've never thought I look ""bad"". I know theres some shadows from the hands of the guy behind me but I don't think it should have caused that remark.

46,1eyq5pv,WIBTA if I shut off the utilities at a former friend’s house?,"Well that’s kind of a long story and English isn’t my first language so bear with me.

I have a friend, let’s call her Anna. Some months ago she was staying with a friend of hers and they got really mad with her and kicked her out and I offered her to stay with me and my former roommate, we were moving and going out separate ways but I offered to transfer that house to her name so she could stay there and rent the other rooms. She wanted me to stay and be her roommate but I got a bad feeling  and declined. Turned out I was right, because Anna became really annoying about household stuff. 

After one month I found a place for myself and so did my previous roommate and we both scheduled moving out on the same week. We agreed on paying the upcoming month’s rent and bills so Anna would have 30 days to find some people to rent the other rooms. This, however, really pissed her off. When the rent was due, she still didn’t sent me her share, so I have to cover her share so we didn’t have a 10% bill because of delays. This annoyed me very much and I had to ask her for her share 3 days because I really needed the money to move and she hesitantly send it to me. I think all of this annoyed her she started saying she wanted the rent contract to remain under my name and I wouldn’t let it be like that, specially after she was late with her very first share of the rent.

I said I wouldn’t keep it under my name and asked her for some documents to transfer the contract and she delayed it and I had to ask multiple times about it and the last time she went off on me saying she wasn’t having time to put the documents together and I was a selfish person that wanted anything handed to me on a silver plate. She was being rude since she moved and this really pissed me off because I opened my home to her when she needed and I was tying to help her by transferring the renting contract to her. Long story short, she sent me the documents and everything took a lot more time than it should and I got increasingly annoyed because she continued to be a bitch every step on the way.

Now for the current situation. The electric bill and water bill are still tied to my name, because in my country they are separate from the rent. I don’t want to keep it tied to me because I don’t trust her and I don’t want my credit score fucked. It’s been 12 days since the contract was transferred and I already gave her the information on how to transfer the other bills to her name (you can do it all on an app and it takes less than 15 minutes each) and she still haven’t done it. She started ignoring my texts. There’s one way I can get rid of my name on the bills that is finishing the contract and this would result in the utilities being shut off from her house and she would have to make a new contract and it can take days and she would be left without water and electricity in this time with her new roommate and this could make me an asshole.

47,1eyq5nh,AITA for getting into an argument with my husband after he booked tickets for his mom to come on a two week trip with us without asking me first? ,"So my husband and I live in the United States, but we’re digital nomads so we like to spend six month periods traveling abroad we traveled last year to Thailand and now this year we’re in Brazil exploring the northeast then going south. We are Brazilians so our whole family lives in this country. 

We’re doing different periods of time in different cities. We already did Fortaleza (1 month), and now we’re doing São Luiz (10 days), then Maceió (2 weeks), then other cities in the south then each of us are going our separate ways to be in our hometowns for 2 months. It’s just me, him, and our baby dog, enjoying our mighty time as couples. However, just last night during dinner I found out that him and his mom decided BY THEMSELVES that she should come the entire two week trip to Maceió. Two weeks, with my mother in law, in a tiny apartment. There is no going back, the decision has been made, flights booked and everything. 

Now i understand that him and his mom live in different countries, and they miss each other… but he is going to spend 2 MONTHS with her in his hometown at the end of the trip anyways, so that’s plenty of time to enjoy her company. 

My point is: I was completely left out of the decision. I believe as a married couple you should consult each other first before making decisions like this. Maybe asking “babe, would you be ok if i brought my mom along to Maceió? For the whole two weeks?” 

I would probably try to negotiate it down to one week, but he didn’t even give me an opportunity to share my input or whether I would be OK with it. This is a huge lack of respect for me because it shows that my opinion doesn’t matter and that he’s gonna do whatever he wants regardless of what I think and how I feel. As if I just had to suck it up and accept it.

So this is what happened when I found out: Immediately I got into an argument with him during dinner (I was very discreet) where I was clearly angry. I was telling him how upset and offended I am that I was completely left out of the decision. He got extremely offended that I wasn’t 100% happy and excited that his mom is spending the two weeks with us (he believes I should be, even though it was a surprise to me), and he even went as far as physically removing his wedding band as a way of showing “either you accept my mom or we can go our separate ways”. Later after dinner he even said things like “if you and I get divorced we’re sharing Penny (our dog)”. LIKE???!!!! Excuse me, sir?!

48,1eypw15,AITA for criticizing my dad for buying tickets for his wife to see Hamilton?,"(Don't know if any of my family uses reddit, so this is a throwaway account)

For some context I am a 21 (almost 22) year old man. My dad is 51 and his wife, who I will refer to as Debbie (fake name for privacy's sake), is 58. 

I grew up pretty poor until my biological mother passed away from cancer in September, 2018, when I was 15 years old. She and my dad had still been married at the time, and I was very close with my mother, so it hit the family hard. Well— most of us. 

To sum up, dad met Debbie on a dating app in December, 2018. Dad proposed to Debbie in June, 2019, and they were married by December, 2019.

Without my mom's medical bills, my dad is now pretty well-off with a good paying job (over 100k/year), and he and Debbie have a lot saved up from insurance and inheritance from my mom and a relative of Debbie's. Meanwhile i've been working any job i can get to keep up with car repair bills, plus paying for all my own personal items since I refuse to ask my dad for money unless I have no other option. I plan to go no contact as soon as I'm able to move out.

My dad, however, complains a lot about being short on money, and insists I— a university student who has been struggling to find work and lost all my savings to fix my car and pay for my own gender transition— pay him since he's ""put food on the table and a roof over my head all these years."" Then recently, he brought up that he was surprising Debbie with tickets to see the musical Hamilton live for her birthday this year, and plans to take her on a European cruise in December for their 5-year anniversary.

Here's where i may be the AH. I got angry when I heard his plans and said how it feels kinda weird to one minute have him complain to me and my sibling (24 nb) about not having enough money and have us pay him for things, and the next brag about the expensive gifts and trips he gets for his wife. He got angry back and said it's because they work hard and save their money (out of the two of them, he's the only one with a job) and that it's his decision what they spend that money on. He also called me entitled because I still rely on him for a lot right now, and do make use of the nice things he and Debbie buy for the household, like the pool and streaming services.

I'm honestly conflicted about this. Every time they bring up their trips or expensive gifts for each other, I just boil inside. Maybe I am taking advantage of them taking care of me but sometimes it just feels so... weird. There's no other word I can think of to describe it.

They haven't even mentioned Hamilton since I criticized my dad about it, and Debbie has been cold and touchy since then. My sibling also sided with my dad and told me I was just irresponsible. I know I'm useless on my own right now since everything is so expensive. Maybe I should be more grateful. 

Am I the AH?

Edit: To clarify some common things I'm seeing in the comments, yes I do live with my dad for the 3 months I'm not living on my college campus. I have a job, and have been working since I was 15, but recent price increases without wage increases (as well as a couple periods without a job once due to the pandemic in 2020 and later due to mental health issues) has made it very very difficult for me to move out. 

I would love nothing more than to move out and provide for myself, I want so so badly to be independant, but it's not financially possible for me right now. I do try to support myself in other ways. I pay rent when I am home, and contribute to groceries and other amenities around the house, as well as paying my own way on vacations we take as a family. I'm trying my hardest to have nothing to owe my dad by the time I am able to leave.

Also, another clarification, the inheritance is Debbie's from a late family member. The money my family got from my mom was the life insurance payout after her death.

There are other grievances I have with both my dad and Debbie that probably contribute to my reaction to all this, but I don't think they are necessary to air on the internet, as they are very personal.

Edit 2: I'm reading through all the comments and so many are saying I'm the AH so i think I'm going to just take some time to reevaluate some things in my life. I think I'm making excuses to justify being angry and lashing out and holding grudges, and I need to fix that about myself. I'll be moving back to school in a few days so the distance might help me sort out my head. 

Thank you for your responses.",Asshole,2024-08-22,"AITA for criticizing my dad for buying tickets for his wife to see Hamilton? (Don't know if any of my family uses reddit, so this is a throwaway account)

For some context I am a 21 (almost 22) year old man. My dad is 51 and his wife, who I will refer to as Debbie (fake name for privacy's sake), is 58. 

I grew up pretty poor until my biological mother passed away from cancer in September, 2018, when I was 15 years old. She and my dad had still been married at the time, and I was very close with my mother, so it hit the family hard. Well— most of us. 

To sum up, dad met Debbie on a dating app in December, 2018. Dad proposed to Debbie in June, 2019, and they were married by December, 2019.

Without my mom's medical bills, my dad is now pretty well-off with a good paying job (over 100k/year), and he and Debbie have a lot saved up from insurance and inheritance from my mom and a relative of Debbie's. Meanwhile i've been working any job i can get to keep up with car repair bills, plus paying for all my own personal items since I refuse to ask my dad for money unless I have no other option. I plan to go no contact as soon as I'm able to move out.

My dad, however, complains a lot about being short on money, and insists I— a university student who has been struggling to find work and lost all my savings to fix my car and pay for my own gender transition— pay him since he's ""put food on the table and a roof over my head all these years."" Then recently, he brought up that he was surprising Debbie with tickets to see the musical Hamilton live for her birthday this year, and plans to take her on a European cruise in December for their 5-year anniversary.

Here's where i may be the AH. I got angry when I heard his plans and said how it feels kinda weird to one minute have him complain to me and my sibling (24 nb) about not having enough money and have us pay him for things, and the next brag about the expensive gifts and trips he gets for his wife. He got angry back and said it's because they work hard and save their money (out of the two of them, he's the only one with a job) and that it's his decision what they spend that money on. He also called me entitled because I still rely on him for a lot right now, and do make use of the nice things he and Debbie buy for the household, like the pool and streaming services.

I'm honestly conflicted about this. Every time they bring up their trips or expensive gifts for each other, I just boil inside. Maybe I am taking advantage of them taking care of me but sometimes it just feels so... weird. There's no other word I can think of to describe it.

49,1eypg37,AITA - Youth Soccer Snacks,"I’ve been a youth sports parent for over eight years now between two kids. 

Recently, my daughter’s 8-10yo soccer team made the assertion to assign a “snack parent” to each family every week there is a game. 

When we met as a team, the mom in charge of snacks asked if there are dietary restrictions and of course there were several. 

Our daughter has none, and likes snacks that others can’t have. 

Other challenges include having to get snacks for siblings, kids not liking what we bring, etc. In years past, my daughter has ended up wasting food half the time because she doesn’t like what she was provided. 

I sent a note suggesting maybe we should just scrap the shared snack program and go on our own based on the dietary needs and the difficulty in keeping everyone happy / safe. I know the girls love it but it would be all the same to just bring your kid a snack for every game.

50,1eypfy5,AITA for agreeing with wife when she called my mom a POS parent? ,"My birth family never respected me.

No one from my side of the family came to my graduation or acted like they cared, while my wife’s family threw me a huge party. 

I don't know if it stems from me being a weird emo kid when I was a teen because my family still says dumb things like, “Remember when you had green hair?” like that was a defining moment of my life. I had green hair for three months when I was 14. It's an odd thing for my family to be hung up on. 

My SIL was pregnant, and I share the name “Larry” with her father, who passed away last year. She named her baby after both of us because I helped her out financially and and encouraged her to finish her degree. 

I saw my mother, and we (my wife and I) was babysitting Little Larry because my SIL was working. My mom said we should dye Little Larry’s hair green. This set my wife off, and she yelled at my mom, saying how pathetic it was that with all of my achievements, my mom still was upset that I dyed my hair green as a teenager. She called my mom pathetic POS parent. My wife asked my mom to leave the house because my SIL wouldn’t want Little Larry around such judgmental trash. I stood there for a few seconds and was like, “She’s right. You should leave.”

52,1eyocsc,AITA for telling by friend not to bring her brother when we hang out?," Yeah, hi, so everyime I (20f) hang out with my friend (21f), she always brings her brother (20m) with her. I feel like I'm a horrible person because every time I'm disappointed that I can't just spend time with just my friend.
 I'm always the driver for us, so I go and pick them up and drive them home. There are times when I have to pay for both of their lunch, even though me and my friend had previously agreed that her brother would pay for his own stuff. I don't mind paying for one extra meal (meaning mine and my friend's meal), but I can't afford to keep paying for her brother's stuff too. So in total I pay for gas, food, and activities (like when we went to the water park, for example, I paid for all three tickets.) 
 I like hanging out with my friend, and she is my only friend because I work too much to be able to work, hang out with her, AND make new friends. It just feels like her brother is using me to get free food and do fun stuff for free. He doesn't have a job or go to school, but he is always talking about how he has plans and will be doing something soon. And I don't wanna sound mean, but he smells bad... like he doesn't smell like he showers and he is in my car a lot, so now I have to air out my car a lot. 
 I recently talk with her about this and she said that I was a bad person because he's her brother and I should just let him come with us. She didn't really give any actual reasons as why I need to let him come with us. She told me that if he can't come, then she can't come either. I understand that's her brother, but they argue all the time when we are out (often making a scene) and her brother is also just kinda a downer. He is always complaining about what we do or where we go to eat, even though he is getting it all for free. He never says thank you, but I never say anything to him because my friend doesn't say thank you either. 
 I just kinda feel used. It's just a lot of money and headaches. I just wanna spend time with my friend.

She’s mentioned before that she’s never really been into learning languages and considers herself bad at them. No problem—everyone’s got their strengths and interests.

During this trip, I’ve been trying to use some basic French phrases here and there, especially when asking for directions or ordering at restaurants. I know I’m far from fluent, but I enjoy learning new languages and wanted to make an effort. We’ve been here for three days now, and today my wife finally asked me to stop. She said I’m being pretentious and trying to show her up, especially since most people in Montreal are bilingual and can speak English just fine.

We tried introducing her to the paci fairy and she was actually willing to give them to the fairy. 

Before bed we put all of her pacifiers under her pillow and she woke up to a new bluey stuffed animal. Her favorite things in the world are bluey and stuffed animals so we thought she’d like it but when she checked under her pillow and saw that all of her pacifiers were gone she was distraught. She kept putting her new toy under her pillow and checking to see if her pacifiers came back. She was crying all day, didn’t want to eat, and was refusing to nap so that night I took her to Walmart and let her pick out some new pacifiers since my boyfriend had already thrown them away. 

My boyfriend got home that night and saw her with a pacifier in her mouth. I told him I got them for her and that we can talk about it later. After I got her in bed he asked what I was thinking getting her new ones after she just gave them up. I explained how she was crying all day, trying to give the toy back, and wouldn’t eat so at this point we should follow her lead on giving them up. She usually only uses them at night unless she’s really upset so it’s not like she constantly has them in her mouth, she just likes having them available. 

He’s upset with me for spoiling her and thinks I should’ve let her cry it out for a few days. I don’t want to leave her to cry for days on end but he’s refusing to be involved with bedtime when she has her pacifier. I’m worried this will hurt her more than losing the pacifiers will.

Before bed we put all of her pacifiers under her pillow and she woke up to a new bluey stuffed animal. Her favorite things in the world are bluey and stuffed animals so we thought she’d like it but when she checked under her pillow and saw that all of her pacifiers were gone she was distraught. She kept putting her new toy under her pillow and checking to see if her pacifiers came back. She was crying all day, didn’t want to eat, and was refusing to nap so that night I took her to Walmart and let her pick out some new pacifiers since my boyfriend had already thrown them away. 

My boyfriend got home that night and saw her with a pacifier in her mouth. I told him I got them for her and that we can talk about it later. After I got her in bed he asked what I was thinking getting her new ones after she just gave them up. I explained how she was crying all day, trying to give the toy back, and wouldn’t eat so at this point we should follow her lead on giving them up. She usually only uses them at night unless she’s really upset so it’s not like she constantly has them in her mouth, she just likes having them available. 

He’s upset with me for spoiling her and thinks I should’ve let her cry it out for a few days. I don’t want to leave her to cry for days on end but he’s refusing to be involved with bedtime when she has her pacifier. I’m worried this will hurt her more than losing the pacifiers will.

","


My (28F) fiancé, Alex (30M), and I are getting married in a few months. We've been together for five years, and he's the love of my life. Alex is a talented artist who works as a freelance illustrator. He doesn't make a ton of money, but he's passionate about what he does, and I support him fully.

My sister, Emily (32F), has always had a more traditional outlook on careers. She works in finance and has been quite successful. Over the years, she's made several snide comments about Alex's job, calling it a ""hobby"" and implying that he's not ambitious enough. I usually let it slide because I know how she is, but it hurts both of us.

A few weeks ago, during a family dinner, Emily made a particularly harsh comment. She said, ""I can't believe you're marrying a starving artist. Are you sure you want to spend your life supporting someone who can't even afford to buy you nice things?"" 

Alex was visibly upset, and I was furious. I told Emily that her comments were out of line and that she needed to respect our relationship. She shrugged it off as a joke, but I didn't find it funny at all.

After that, I started to reconsider inviting Emily to our wedding. I don't want any negativity on our special day, and I know she'll probably say something rude or judgmental. So, I decided not to invite her. 

When Emily found out, she was livid. She accused me of overreacting and said that I was choosing a man over my own sister. My parents are upset too and think I'm being too harsh, but they don't understand how hurtful her words have been.

After the surgery my mother was visiting and I tried to have a conversation with her about how we were trying to be really calm and peaceful in his room and let him rest and focus on healing. As soon as I started speaking she seemed to interpret this as me telling her she was doing something wrong or incorrectly. I continued to try and explain that I wasn't upset about anything she had done I just wanted to communicate what we were trying to do to make sure my child was healing. She left the hospital and I ended up telling her that if she wasn't going to listen to what I had to say in regards to my child's care that she would not be welcome at the hospital. This then turned into a variety of personal attacks and mean text messages and a full blown argument. I have told her multiple times that she is not removed from the visitation list or banned from the hospital but she has to listen to what I say about his care. 
Then she started telling me how everything I was doing was wrong and I needed to do this and that differently. Mainly in regard to how I choose to let him rest and give him space instead of holding his hand and talking the entire time. 
I told her that she was welcome to disagree but that it is my child and I would make the final decisions and I expected her to abide by them. 
Now she is refusing to come to the hospital insisting that i told her she is not allowed. 
So my question is really. AITAH for trying to get her to follow my rules while visiting my child and should I have done something different

61,1eymfsd,AITA for texting my male neighbor?,"I (30F) moved into a neighborhood about three and a half years ago. In the first few months, I often had my parents over to help with yard work as the backyard was a huge undertaking. A neighbor (50+) down the street would often pop by while we were out to talk and even gave me his number if I needed anything (I was living alone at the time). During the landscaping overhaul, I was getting rid of a ton of river rocks that were scattered throughout the backyard and said neighbor mentioned he wanted them. So I would text him when we had another load of river rocks to get rid of and then he would come pick them up. He is a very nice guy and made me feel super welcome in the neighborhood. He would always stop and say hello when he drove past me in his car, and I was out walking my dogs. 

A few months into living here, I noticed there were cops at his house, so I texted him something along the lines of “Hey, saw the cops at your place. Hope everything is okay.” He responded that he was out of the country, but it was good to know, and he would check in with his wife. 

Since living here, we would do the occasional pleasantries when he would walk or drive by. Up until today, I’ve never met his wife or even seen her. I was out walking my dogs and happened to pass my neighbor and who I assume is his wife. When I walk the dogs, I typically have my airpods in listening to music. I didn’t think much of it when I walked by them, did the neighborly smile and kept walking until I heard my name. My neighbor yelled my name, asked about my dogs, I answered then kept walking.

All was fine until I get a visitor at my front door about 30 minutes later. I go outside to chat as my dogs were barking, and the lady introduces herself as my neighbor’s wife. She then goes in talking about how I “called” (not true) her husband while he was out of town about the police being at her house. Truth be told, I completely forgot about it until she detailed a little bit more. She goes on to tell me she’s been ""angry for the past three years"" about this and wanted to clear the air. Confused, I explained that my intent in the text was to just say that I hoped everything was okay and was not done in a prying manner. She said regardless, if I really cared, I should have come up to their house and knocked on the door to check on them. My neighbor’s wife then goes on to say that “as a woman” I should have gone to her and not her husband. Again, I’ve never talked to or seen her and only had her husband’s number at the time. I explained that, but she said it was still inappropriate that I reached out to her husband as I’m a woman.

I thought I was doing the right thing to check on someone who had been super nice to me, but the way she talked about it and the fact that she has been “angry for the past three years” is really making me think I did something wrong.

64,1eylq6o,AITA - Should my roommate have to clean her room?,"So I’m the sole homeowner of a house and have rented out three rooms in the house and we all split the rent and bills evenly to make it cheap for everyone. We have a rotating chore list. I pay for all the bills and repairs up front and then my roommates pay me back for their equal portions when they can.

I feel like I’m super fair about it and the repairs can be huge ($2k for the new water heater, $1k for the new washing machine, $750 for plumbing, etc.) I let them pay me when they can.

I’ve asked everyone to respect the house and treat it as if they owned it. I’m a very organized person and have anxiety with major messes. I don’t expect everything to be put away all the time but just have a general consensus of where things go and ask that there’s no piles of unattended things lying around.

Am I the asshole? ",Asshole,2024-08-22,"AITA - Should my roommate have to clean her room? So I’m the sole homeowner of a house and have rented out three rooms in the house and we all split the rent and bills evenly to make it cheap for everyone. We have a rotating chore list. I pay for all the bills and repairs up front and then my roommates pay me back for their equal portions when they can.

I feel like I’m super fair about it and the repairs can be huge ($2k for the new water heater, $1k for the new washing machine, $750 for plumbing, etc.) I let them pay me when they can.

I’ve asked everyone to respect the house and treat it as if they owned it. I’m a very organized person and have anxiety with major messes. I don’t expect everything to be put away all the time but just have a general consensus of where things go and ask that there’s no piles of unattended things lying around.

I (26NB) and “Sam” (23F) had been “friends” for about 6 years. “Friends” in the way that I was driving an hr one way to see her for 20m or feed her pets while she was on vacation, doing full-on photoshoots at her request every time we hung out outside her parents house, and swallowing my upset that she made us late to see my favorite band open for a concert when I paid for her ticket…where she refused to drive to me, got annoyed when I asked for a few pictures of my own, and was more concerned about getting weed than getting to the venue on time. If I dared mention to her how her actions/words hurt me, she’d tell me that I need to “get over it” and that it was all my fault (regardless of the issue. She told me it was my fault we got to the venue late cause I was driving, despite us leaving 15 minutes late so she could make a tiktok - she’s considered a member of the creator fund there due to her high following and insisted she \*needed\* to make it, despite the video not going up until several weeks later).

\*Everything\* I did was scrutinized; how I dressed, what I ate, even who I talked to. She hated my supervisor “Rich” for no legitimate reason other than \*I\* disliked him, but she failed to acknowledge that he was the closest thing I had to a friend nearby. (She met him twice - once for about 5 minutes, and the second at brunch on my birthday. Mind you, she and I had made plans for after brunch \*months\* in advance that she ended up flaking on because she wanted to hang out with her bf that she sees near daily). Anytime I mentioned him in any way, even just talking about my day at work, she’d get into a sour mood and start telling me I was dumb for talking to him.

Anyway, I decided that I want to get a tattoo as a reference to a musical that I love, had introduced her to, and she also loved. I brought it up to her as a “semi-matching tattoo”, the plan being that we get the same letters (WWSJD) in different fonts. I wanted mine to have a post-apocalyptic feel, like something you'd see spray painted in an abandoned subway tunnel after the aliens descend, and couldn’t find a font online that I liked. Day before, I asked Rich to write it out for me, as his hand-writing is exactly what I was looking for.

So Sam picked me up (my car was not an option, I still ended up doing the majority of the driving in her car) and asked what font I chose. I showed her the piece of paper that it was scrawled on, and she asked if I wrote it. I knew if I told her Rich wrote it, I’d get reemed for it, and assuming it wasn’t a big deal, lied and said I had written it. Again, the \*plan\* was to get different fonts, so I didn’t see the harm.

I haven't lived with her since 2014, and the cat has been with her ever since. He was somewhat old at 12, but I've heard some cats live to 17.

Still, he was extremely obese, as my mom had the habit of feeding him with those supermarket pastes.

Today at 8:00 am she sent me an image of the cat, dead.

I called her to console her. She told me the cat was in pain yesterday and that she, in order to calm the cat's pain, gave him 1/4 of a Paracetamol tablet.

Paracetamol, for those who don't know, is extremely toxic for cats. Their digestive system just can't handle it, and even small doses can be lethal. For a cat that was already suffering from stomach issues, that might've been the final straw.

So I told her, calmly, that she shouldn't have done that and explained her why. I didn't blame her, I just told her the effects of the drug because I remembered.

She started crying, telling me the vet had told her to...

So either the vet is a complete incompetent fraud that should quit, or my mom is lying.

Either way, I feel like complete trash because there was nothing to be gained from making my mom feel bad for a mistake like that...

Though not annoying at first, one of the calls was us sitting in silence and listening to him talking to his friends for 5-10 mins. They eventually hung up. 10-20 minutes go by and she calls him again, and I get up and go take a walk around the park. She called me 15 min later. We walked home in silence for 30 min then back to normal. 

A few days after the trip, something she said made the upset resurface and I told her this and that I don't feel like talking atm. She said we’ll talk about it f2f and I agreed. I kept sending her memes, as usual, to keep things normal. She left me on delivered for 2 weeks. When I finally told her I don't like being ghosted, she told me she was pondering cutting me off because to her, leaving her alone on a bench in an unknown town is unforgivable. Some other things bothered her related to her bf. 

For a bit of context, she has encouraged us to get along, we’d all hang out. We frequently replied to each other stories (common interests, not selfies), he'd call to ask stuff ab college or advice on my friend and we were encouraged to share personal stories etc. One time, he got her a sack of lavender and he also got me one. I found it a bit random, but she didn't mind. They were broken up when me&her met, but she wanted to introduce him to me and I encouraged them to make up because they still had feelings for each other. 

The interactions are: 1. They were on call months ago while we were having a sleepover. They kept congratulating each other and I asked what for, ""our one month anniversary"". I don’t remember this happening and all I know is from her telling me now. Allegedly, I angrily replied ""I don't care it happened to you, it should've happened to me"". I find it hard to believe that was the only thing I said. In case any of you doesn't know, that is a meme reference. 2.

If you take it out of context, it sounds like I was asking him to fuck ME, but I obviously wasn’t.

She found it weird that I asked him that.

After apologising for any discomfort I created and explaining everything, she said we are OK and proposed hanging out soon and resumed our usual dynamic. For three days.

For back story, my friend stays in a different city and we  occasionally see each other. She has been going through a relationship issue for the past few years mainly because her man is t*xic. I was always available for her and would be her shoulder to cry on whenever she needed me. At first, I realized this was odd and would offer advice to break up with this man but she never listened and will come back to tell me they reconciled.

On my honeymoon trip, after I had my civil wedding, my best friend called me to complain about her relationship and how heart broken she was. I left my husband at home and traveled three hours to see her and made sure she was alright. I spent a two days at her place. 

Back to recently, when I was preparing to have my church wedding, I sent her an invitation and was really looking forward to having her at my intimate wedding (40 guests). Fast forward to the day of the wedding, my best friend sent me a text message to congratulate me and that was it. She actually didn’t show up at my wedding at all. I was very sad as I wanted to be surprised by my her and honestly would have done same for her. Anyways, I made this slide and posted my beautiful pictures on social media and on my stories. I was very disheartened when I realized that she never liked any of my wedding pictures even though she was very active and would send me messages all day everyday on all the social media platforms. 

So I questioned her why she never showed any interest in the important events in my life and she blamed it on the emotional str*ss she is always going through with her man. I made her understand that I will not be a party to her relationship anymore and will not let that affect our relationship. If she genuinely wants this friendship to work, she should be invested as much as I am. And told her to contact me when she is in a good headspace to have a friendship with me. 

Since then, I hardly contact her or share anything with her anymore. So am I the asshole for ignoring her?

73,1eyjru6,WIBTA for moving out of roommates place after this interaction?,"Me, Austin (25M) & her, Annie (49F) are having a uh..'middle school fued'?

I moved in bc I knew her, she had a good rep & our interactions were nice. I needed a spot, & she had a room open. Over 1yr, there's been tedious issues that I've experienced. Ik it comes w/ the territory, but these are like.. a kitchen table moved 2 inches & it's a big deal

We used to spend a good chunk of time together, be it hanging out/working together. We're both in the same career field. Except now, I've made a lot of friends & I'm dating, things change but we still find time to hang/work.

My original last straw, were issues with the AC temp. We live in a hot state, she keeps inside temp so uncomfortable. I've mentioned how hot I am many times, so I turn it down when I can.

But NOW to add ontop of that, she called me today (knowing i'm in therapy) I ignored it. she texted me: ""--I was thinking about u & wanted to talk. It’s not an emergency. We can chat whenever."" I asked if everything was OK, she said ""Yes!! Totally.""

She sidetracked & texted like normal. I told her that I ""would be home at X time and we can chat then."" She followed up: ""I will be leaving around that time, I'm doing \_\_\_!!"" THEN I followed up with push, saying: ""Is it anything to do with (her own current conflicts?) I might be home in time, and we can chat before you have to leave."" She responded: ""-No it is all is fine, don’t worry! It's just my over active brain, always thinking about everyone & taking care of them! Please do not rush to get home. It is not a big deal.""

Imo it's rude to tell someone you want to talk to them ab something & not give them any clue as to what?

I replied: ""I'm headed home now.(insert positive comments/questions about her night here-) You can text me when ur free, since it’s not a big deal, that would be awesome. I get paranoid when people say they want to talk but don’t tell me about what. text me whenever, or I’ll see you later!""

She got home about 5 mins before I did, & she was already upstairs. She shut the stair lights off? She has never done that. It gave me ""I'm going into my room, leave me alone"" vibes. She's normally chatty, happy & sweet BUT can be rude or passive-aggressive. It was odd. I feel like her ""talk"" will be her concerned about me moving, as I have a long-term GF. she gets so upset thinking about it & even cries. Or maybe it's just an AC convo? I won't assume anymore lmao. I appreciate her but she's hard to live with. This was the icing on the cake, I feel disrespected & I take that very seriously

**WIBTA** if I told her this interaction was my push to begin moving out, even if she attempts compromise?

74,1eyjm2g,AITA for accepting things from my girlfriend?,"So, i've been living with my girlfriend for 6 months and our financial situations are pretty different. i live in her house, which is paid for and we share all the costs of living(house expenses and food). The problem is with food delivery and going out. for the first two months i still had some money left and we split those in half, like it should be. then my money started to end and for about the last 3 months everytime she orders food for the both of us(which might be 15% of the time she orders food for herself) she pays for my half. mind you i rarely asked her to buy something(like 2 times in these 3 months), i was always very clear that i did not have money to contribute and was fine not sharing the food. a few times also she bought us food without even consulting with me, if i wanted of if i could pay for it. 

this month i got a job in sales and have been doing well so next month i'll start getting comissions and my financial situation is going to be alright, i'll be able to pay my bills, eat out and still have some money left. 

the problem came a few days back when she said i spent 3 months unemployed, that i was not sharing things equally with her and she felt i was taking advantage of her. 

The total of what she spent with me is about 400 reais(we're from brazil) over these 3 months(mind you she spends around 2000 monthly with eating out) and i'm thinking of just paying her this money back and be done with it. 

so, am i the asshole? and should i pay her back that money even though i was always clear that i could not afford? (she is not asking me to pay her back of anything, i just think that would solve the problem without that situation ever being thrown in my face again)

75,1eyjj5a,AITA for not standing up for my coworker?,"I (22F) work as a barista at an independent coffee shop. Recently there's been a staff shortage, so we've been having baristas from an agency come to help us out some days. One barista (25F) came along last week after having worked a shift here before, and we were the only two there that day. 

It was pretty busy, and a middle-aged lady with some older relatives came along and ordered some coffees. In our shop, we call out the order after it's made, and the people come to collect it. We let all the customers know that so there's no confusion. As usual, I let the group know and the lady said ""okay"". Sometimes groups sit down at their tables while waiting, and this group did that - I thought nothing of it and continued with other orders. I was behind the scenes that day making coffee, and the other barista was front of house, taking orders and calling them out. With it being a summer day in a tourist spot, we were particularly busy.

About fifteen minutes later I heard raised voices from the counter. I recognised one as my co-worker, and the other as the lady from the group. I went out to find both of them yelling at each other, while other customers awkwardly watched on. It turns out my co-worker had called their order several times, and the group had watched her do it, but had not come to collect their order and seemingly expected table service, despite my telling them otherwise. The lady was yelling that her drinks were now cold and that my co-worker had never called them out. My co-worker was shouting back that they had made direct eye contact as she called them several times but didn't move. 

I've had rude, difficult customers here before, but I'd never dealt with people shouting at each other like this. I sought to immediately diffuse the situation, by moving between them and gently asking the lady what the problem was. She was still pissed off but instantly stopped shouting and explained. I told her we'd definitely called out her order, but we'd make them again for her. She seemed annoyed but did calm down and agreed, and this time collected her coffees.

I was a bit shaken, so I couldn't imagine how my co-worker felt. After they'd gone I went into the back with her and asked if she wanted to take her break and have some extra time. She simply nodded and left, and when she came back I realised she was angry with me. She said I should have defended her more and not ""pandered"" to the woman who was being unreasonable. I tried explaining that I had always been on her side, and had just wanted to diffuse things and get them out the door, but she didn't agree. The rest of the shift was tense and she left at the end without saying goodbye.

76,1eyiy8y,AITA for blaming my husband after an accident I made,"My husband (26 M) and I (21 F) have been married for a little over a year, together in total for 3. Today we had an argument, it was mainly petty, I made a stew and it was too full to put on the pressure cooker mode on our pressure cooker/slow cooker that he has had since he was 18 when he started university. So my husband decided it would be better to put it on the slow cooker mode, I offered to pour some out so we could get it down to the full line. However, he said no and that it would be fine. We put it on and left it for a little while and then I heard a mass amount of sizzling so I went to check it with him following behind, I quickly turned it off and took the pot out however the stew over flowed over the side and onto the plate that heats up the cooker (in the instructions it advises never to let food or water onto said plate). 

This is when all hell broke loose, he started screaming at me telling me I am stupid and all other kinds of horrid words. I recently got fired from my job over something very trival and he started using that against me telling me I suck at everything and can never do anything right. He slammed the kitchen door really hard that I thought it would come off its hinges, he screamed at me so loud that my ears started ringing. 

After he finished shouting at me, I basically blamed him, I advised I was sorry but he told me this was the best idea to put it on for slow cook instead of pouring a bit out to allow for us to use the mode we are comfortable with, I know I shouted back at him which isn't a good idea but I was really mad, it took me an hour to make this stew ready for it to be left on cook and I've taken over all the household chores since I have become unemployed. 

He treats me like a stupid child sometimes just because I want to make nice meals for him, like recently I have started to make bread and pasta etc. I'd never made this stew before and I wanted to make it so we can freeze it and have it for after we go for long hikes.

At first they knew each other as parents of kids in the same class, they started dating two years ago and they got engaged 6 months ago. My sister's daughter is Lily (14) and Mark's daughter is Gemma (14). The girls weren't big fans of each other before my sister and Mark started dating. There was no bullying or serious bad blood before but they weren't friends and they didn't want to be.

Once my sister and Mark started dating? Oh boy did things change. Fighting at school, fighting when they'd all meet up to spend time together, fighting at home after they moved in together, they fought at the engagement party and again at the engagement dinner, which was just for family.

My sister asked me to be her maid of honor and I said yes. At the time I wasn't aware my sister and Mark were forcing the girls to be bridesmaids and when I learned this, my sister told me one of my maid of honor jobs was to keep on top of the girls during wedding prep and on the wedding day. She wated me to make sure they were smiling for photos, to make sure they don't argue and to make sure they didn't ruin their dresses or anything out of spite at the wedding.

I told her that was a big ask and she told me it's the duty of a maid of honor to ensure things go perfectly. And it won't be perfect if the girls look angry in photos or start yelling at each other. She said it also won't be any good if they refuse to stand near each other. I told her that's an impossible task given they fight all the time. She told me I can figure something out and as the young, cool aunt I could find a way. I tried once. We went dress shopping for the wedding dress and the girls were fighting the whole time. Gemma told my sister she looked disgusting in every dress which made her and Lily's fighting worse. It was crazy and even when I sorta got them separated it was clear they were ready to fight some more.

So I stepped down as maid of honor and told my sister it was not a job I would do. She became angry and told me I need to step up here as her sister and who else will do it. I told her nobody in their right mind would and just because I'm her sister it doesn't mean I'm willing to be miserable like that for her.

Then my neighbour said: can they go inside the house to see how it looks right now? 
I said; everything has changed, but no, sorry. I don't feel comfortable with that, I don't know you.

I was quite shocked, but politely told her I am not comfortable with it, if I had a house that I sold I would look it from the road and continue where I was going in the first place. 
She told me a lot of things more while 3 daughters were also visibly angry. 

This left me thinking am I the asshole for not letting them see inside and make a tour for them in yard etc. ?

I was quite shocked, but politely told her I am not comfortable with it, if I had a house that I sold I would look it from the road and continue where I was going in the first place. 
She told me a lot of things more while 3 daughters were also visibly angry. 

This left me thinking am I the asshole for not letting them see inside and make a tour for them in yard etc. ? 


Edit: Mom just got from work. After I told her what happend, she told me that alredy happend 10 years ago. She was also confused but she let them in, because she didn't want to fight with our neighbour. So they have seen the house alredy... :O",0.0,0.989696204662323,1,0

80,1eyi5o0,AITA For Reducing Rent For One Roommate Instead of the Others?,"Title: And Not the Others\*

I (F19) live in a condo my parents bought for me to live in while I'm in school. Still on summer break as i type this by the way.

The condo is 4bd 4ba, so I have one room and rent out the other three. I rent to F20, M20, and M20. The F20 roommate became pregnant in April. I knew she was scrambling for money since she was working two jobs to cover rent and baby stuff. Since everyone rents on a month-to-month lease, I told her in May that I would half her rent. My parents pay everything toward the condo anyways so I'm always making a profit. She seemed really happy that her probably biggest expense was reduced, and I was happy to do that.

Guess she told M20 and M20 and a week or so later they started complaining to me about ""unfairness.' I just told them they could always get pregnant and get their rent reduced too. That ended the conversation quickly, and I'm posting about it now.

84,1eyfqtw,AITA for what I said when my parents announced they were having another baby?,"My parents have 7 kids. There's me (16m), Cayla (13f), Robin (12m), Sam (10m), Laci (8f), Zoe (6f) and Robbie (4m). They only ever intended to have two kids and even with me and Cayla alone, they'd still struggle. My parents don't have great jobs. We never had much space in our house to begin with and now we're all crammed in. I started working at 13 to get money so I could pay for stuff I needed, like a laptop, which I didn't have access to when my school first shut down. We didn't even have internet then. My parents swore they were done with Robbie and they'd get us back on track and that I wouldn't need to work just to pay for stuff I needed for school. The weight of being the oldest is already a lot and I have paid for stuff before. I babysit so my parents can work nights or get a break. I take care of the house most days so they can focus on earning money. But it's a lot and we're really too big of a family for what we can actually afford. My parents get help from the government but it doesn't go far because they're not good with money or with buying groceries.

When no baby came right after Robbie I thought they were serious and I started to think about my future. I'd love to learn to cook better and work in a restaurant. Not college exactly because we could never afford it and my grades aren't good enough but something.

Then Monday my parents sat us down and told us they're having another baby and mom is like 14 weeks pregnant. They knew for 7 weeks and didn't want to tell us until they were ready. My siblings were mostly surprised but me? I said not again. I think I even cried a little which caught me off guard because I'm not a crier usually. This was apparently enough to break me though. My parents got so angry at me and told me to check my attitude. I told them they gave me this attitude by being so reckless and putting so much on me and now they've broken their promise and we're going to struggle even more than before. They told me to stop acting like they're doing something to me, that accidents happen and they'd never abort, even if they could. They told me to focus on making things okay and less on being so negative.

I know people say that having money isn't as important as long as you have a loving family and maybe that's true for some people.

He left our mom while she was pregnant with me. They were both 24 by that point, having my brother when they were 22, and so still young but not like 18 or 19 young, you know? But I know that excuse has always been made for him, that he was young and dumb, etc. We didn't ever know him or want to know him. Our mom died when we were still young (7 and 9) so our aunt and uncle, mom's sister and her husband, finished raising us. All without any help from our father. He evaded child support for 18 years because we had no idea where he was.

Our father actually left the country and moved back 5 months ago with his wife. We found out because she contacted us on social media. We ignored her the first time. Then she reached out again. The first time she was like hi, I'm married to your dad, we just moved here, we're expecting a child together and we want you to know your new brother. The second time it touched on the move and the expecting a baby together thing but also went into how important family is and how we might be mad at our father but we have an innocent sibling who would love to grow up with his older brother and sister in his life. There was such a deep attempt to shame us into responding. All the mentions of her child being innocent, using the word brother and not even half, talking about generational mistakes, etc. We again didn't respond and she tried to send us individual messages after that. Which angered my brother. He met her once and he told her he hoped our father left her son the way he left us and then she'd understand why she was such a fucking bitch trying to shame us or claim we had any obligation to her kid, that he hoped she knew her kid was nothing to him and would never be his real sibling and he didn't give a flying fuck if it hurt her kids feelings or not because they're not family. He also brought up the fact our father owed tens of thousands in child support and he hoped they wouldn't need that money because if she made contact one more time he'd chase after it and he didn't care if it made them homeless or not.

My brother told me he'd met her but didn't give details about how it went and I didn't ask. Then suddenly she shows up at my aunt and uncles house and she ""wanted to talk"" or whatever but she basically tried putting what my brother said on me and also tried to add more shame for not showing an interest in her son. She was also looking for me to berate my brother for what he said to her. I told her I wasn't going to turn against my brother in favor of her or her child. I also told her I am not responsible for my brother and I refuse to take any because she wants me to. Then I closed the door in her face (I didn't let her inside even though she's heavily pregnant now). She created another social media account and told me how rude I was to her. That she just wanted me to say I didn't agree with all the disgusting things my brother said to her.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-22,"AITA for telling my deadbeat father's wife that I'm not responsible for my older brother? My brother (20m) and I (18f) share the same deadbeat father. He left our mom while she was pregnant with me. They were both 24 by that point, having my brother when they were 22, and so still young but not like 18 or 19 young, you know? But I know that excuse has always been made for him, that he was young and dumb, etc. We didn't ever know him or want to know him. Our mom died when we were still young (7 and 9) so our aunt and uncle, mom's sister and her husband, finished raising us. All without any help from our father. He evaded child support for 18 years because we had no idea where he was.

Our father actually left the country and moved back 5 months ago with his wife. We found out because she contacted us on social media. We ignored her the first time. Then she reached out again. The first time she was like hi, I'm married to your dad, we just moved here, we're expecting a child together and we want you to know your new brother.

89,1eye30x,AITA for telling my friend he’s the typical idiot girls use for money,"I’ve got a friend Jay (both 21M) I’ve known for 8 years. We’re in the same friend group since high school. Jay is rich (relatively speaking) and has over 80k in the bank!

Here’s the problem. Jay uses his money as a method to attract girls. He’s a bit douchey because he flexes is money, how he travels, his designer products and even carries receipts to show people! (Lmao). But hey we’re happy for him. He doesn’t flaunt it in OUR faces, just other girls…

So he’s told us stories about girls using him for money. He doesn’t realize this himself, he thinks they’re interested in him. He told us how he spends between 200-500 on dates but the girls are special and worth it. But a lot of the time, it seems to me the girls lead him on to go on the dates but never actually want to be in a relationship.

Yesterday, we went clubbing. Jay got drunk and spent a lot on alcohol, especially for other girls. He ended up spending nearly a grand before we took him home. A lotta girls flirted with him, got him to buy them expensive drinks and left straight away.

He ended up with no girls, got very drunk and upset. One of our friends left the club with a girl that was “flirting” with Jay. Jay was angry and said that the friend broke bro code and stole a girl from him. He was angry and said he’s a fake friend, he’s tired of US using HIM for money and that no one cares.

He was having a bit of a stinker. I felt bad of course, he’s my friend. But he’s also an idiot at times. Example: this night.

When taking him home, he sobered up a little on the train. He was still complaining about the friend taking his girl and I told him outright that he’s an idiot if he thinks the girl was gna sleep with him. I told him that all the girls that “flirted” were just using him to get alcohol, and that this happens because he flaunts his money.

I said he’s a typical idiot that girls will prey on to use for their money because he’s so desperate he’s willing to blow away money for some attention. I said the friend who took the girl didn’t even buy her a drink, he just flirted with her. And he didn’t have to flaunt money either.

I thought it was high time Jay heard this. It wasn’t coming from a place of anger, jealousy or malice. I think it’s the truth and my friends had thought so too, but no one ever told him. Anyway, that kinda shut him up. We dropped him, went home and I’ve yet to check up on him. I’m going to call him soon but thought it’d be helpful to get some advice on if I was being an ass to him last night or not. He seemed pretty upset after what I said and I’ve been feeling guilty for being unsympathetic.

90,1eyduxd,AITA for calling out our unborn’s self-appointed God mother? ,"Ok, so my fiancé and I are expecting. We both decided we weren’t naming God parents, however, his sister’s best friend has taken it upon herself to call herself our child’s Godmother. My fiancé told her where we stood, yet she continues to say it. When I asked him why he’s stopped correcting her he claims “It’s just silly and cutesy. It really doesn’t matter because if something were to happen our kid would go to one of our parents.” I see his point, yet it grinds my gears every time I hear her say it. My thing is, he’s corrected her yet she’s completely disregarded what he said. So I sent her a DM on IG (I thought it was as nice as I could get it) and he had a fit. Told me to unsend the message because she’s having a hard life and just wants to be included. So I’m supposed to just let her call herself our kid’s Godmother after we said no? I told him it’s not just some cute thing for her, she’s getting attached to it. We had a baby shower and she wrote “from your godmother” in the dang guestbook. He’s so concerned with hurting her feelings it’s making me mad. He wants me to sit down with her and ask her why she wants the title so bad but I literally do not care to do so because nothing she says will change how I feel.

UPDATE: Thank you all for your insights! I ended up sending her a more direct message and what do you know, she wasn’t playing around.

91,1eydt8b,AITA For Asking My Friend To Stop Smoking In Their Own Home While I'm There?,"This happened a couple weeks ago.

Whenever I hang out with my friend they usually smoke one or two cigarettes while I'm there. I absolutely detest smoking and especially the smell it leaves. Not to mention how bad second hand smoke is for your health. Anyway in the past I haven't said anything about as I'm generally pretty conflict avoidant, but whenever I hang out there and they've smoked I hate it and when I get home I essentially need to wash all my clothes and myself just to get rid of the smell. This is especially annoying if I'd just picked out a new outfit I was planning on wearing later or the next day or just washed my hair, as I feel the smell just lingers forever especially in the type of hair that I have (tightly coiled hair) pretty much forcing me to take a shower and wash my hair again. It's a bit irrational sure, but the smell and the feeling it gives me is also just plain disgusting.

Anyway this leads us to a couple of weeks ago where I finally said something as I was chilling there. I hadn't even been there for an hour closer to 45 minutes, when they grabbed a cigarette and I asked them to please not, because it smells and I've just put on new clothes washed my hair and I can't stand the smell and also it's bad for my lungs. They said: ""well it's my house so no."" So I said: ""alright I'll just leave then"" and they said: ""alright cool see you later"" and also added that I was being ""disrespectful"" for even mentioning this in the first place. Now this is what kinda really pissed me off, because wtf? It's just a simple question, I'm not telling them, I didn't yell or ask in a passive agressive tone. Just said, yo can you not while I'm here or I'ma dip, essentially. And somehow that's disrespectful? If a friend asked me to stop doing something that costs me nothing because it makes them uncomfortable not to mention is ADVERSE TO THEIR HEALTH. I wouldn't hesitate for a moment, hell I might even apologise for making them uncomfortable in the first place. If anything I think it's disrespectful to care so little about a friend's wishes. I didn't say any of this or anything at all, I just dabbed them up and walked out. They didn't even wait for me to leave and had already lit their cigarrete before I was proper out the door.

Anyway was I in the wrong here or disrespectful in anyway? I don't think I am, but maybe I've missed something. Would love to hear other opinions.",Asshole,2024-08-22,"AITA For Asking My Friend To Stop Smoking In Their Own Home While I'm There? This happened a couple weeks ago.

I don’t blame her for her choices, I know she worked hard to improve herself and to get to a place where she would have the means to raise me right, but it wasn’t until I was 11 or 12 that she was stable enough to get me to live with her (bio dad was never in the picture).

I’ve naturally been stressed to all hell. I even needed to go to the doctor because it’s been affecting my physical health (stress induced ibs etc.)

I have been trying to fix it while keeping up with my daily responsibilities and making sure it doesn’t affect my family or friends but sometimes I get in a low mood and really just need to be alone.

Now, my mother(37f) has recently been sick (slowly getting better). Unlike my father and I, she‘s very much a ‘tell me your feelings’ type of person. And it shows even more when she’s sick. She gets extra irritable, sad, etc. I know this so I try my best to be positive and more cuddly or saying ‘i love you’ more.

Last night though, I was really struggling. Just with insecurities and what not about my intelligence. I really wanted to confide in my father and was waiting for my mother to go to bed because I knew if I went out while crying she’d start constantly asking what was bothering me. Which I know is normal and shows she cares but it wasn’t what I needed and besides, she was sick and I knew she was struggling with some other things. (She cried while eating dinner about two days ago.)  
Eventually she comes into my room to say goodnight but notices i’m more quiet and asks me whats wrong a few times. I say ’nothing’, ‘I don’t wanna talk about it right now’ and ‘im fine’. To be fair I did get a bit snappy when she came into my room for the third time to ask. Mainly my tone.  
I got comforted by father after that and I thought it was done.

This morning, she still seems mad. I asked if she’s mad at me and she says no, irritated with me.

96,1eyc8sx,AITA for giving my roommate and ultimatum about their cat?,"My fiancee and I are cat parents with 2 fuzzy potatoes of our own, we have a roommate who also has 2 cats (an aggressive black cat and sweet tortie). Our own babies are a chill orange tabby and a rambunctious grey 1 year old. We have worked with our babies for years to get good about acclimating new feline friends into the family, and due to lack of action from her owner, we have worked to socialize the tortie with our older orange tabby and that has gone well so far. Minus a bit of trauma hissing at the orange loaf, but she's used to getting attacked by the black cat, so we're taking it slow with letting them get used to each other in the same space. The problem lies with the aggressive black cat, he's the type of cat that would do better in a house with no other pets, this cat has attacked our roommate's other cat, forced a spat with our 1 yr old kitten, scratched my fiancee and even their own owner. 

Now, I know having a multi-cat household can be stressful for fuzz butts and we've been doing our best to ease that stress for them, but this is also requiring us to alternate locking up our own cats for hours at a time, so the problem cat can roam at night and let their owner sleep. We've tried closing him into their bedroom when our kitties need to roam, but this void rattles their doorknob nonstop along with screams in their face if he does not get free reign of the house. We have no hopes of socializing this angry cat and I'm tired of fighting a cat back into their room to perform the cat switch. 

He will not be handled without a fight, and I mean this cat hisses, bites, charges and swipes at us. I've gotten in the habit of just blanket charging him while hissing to scare him back into the room to avoid scrapping with this feline demon. We just want to let the babies that can get along roam without risking one of them getting hurt by this one singular cat. I don't want to wait until severe harm comes to one of the other babies to deal with this rising issue.

From the moment i was born i have suffered with extreme anxiety and It gets even worse when i feel physically stuck or mentally stuck, I have struggled with wanting to die and other things i can’t say on here

Yesterday, I was supposed to get on a flight back to my hometown and I had a huge panic attack, I was taking deep breaths, I took magnesium, I took cbd, And i took my medication that i’m supposed to take when i have extreme panic attacks. none of it worked. 
So I freak the fuck out, but not making a scene because we’re in the middle of an airport and i try to be as respectful as i can, my siblings and other family were already back in my hometown so it was just me and my parents, 
Im having the biggest panic attack i have ever had and i feel so uncomfortable i can’t stop crying and I feel so unbelievably ucomfortable.

My mother walks away to go talk to the baggage people to see if she can get a refund for my ticket and get ny bag back. I was left with my dad.

I’m crying, crying, and crying that’s all i’m not wailing i’m not screaming i’m standing off to the side crying, and my father broke my heart in a way no one else possibly could, He said

“You’re the reason this family is fucking ruined and i will never forgive you for this.” 

 “you’re so fucking unreal”

 “you need to be in a fucking mental hospital, you don’t deserve to live in a house”

 “fuck you” 

“fuck this” 

“i don’t know what the fuck you want me to do with you” 


I tried to defend myself, i told him that I am able to understand that it’s not fair to him but he doesn’t care that it’s not fair to me, the way he looked at me i will never forget. He looked so ashamed to have me as a daughter. When i needed him the most, Strangers came up to me and hugged me and told me everything was okay, well he stared at me in disgust, my own father 

I’m a teenage girl, i can’t even drive yet, I had to walk out of the airport and call everyone i know to take me home, he said i get no more privileges and I fucked everything up and i’m a horrible daughter for this

99,1eybd28,AITA for snitching on my boyfriend?,"This is being posted on a burner for obvious reasons.

Me (22M) and my now ex-boyfriend (24M, whom I'll call B) lived not-so-good lives. We were commonly involved in some dodgy business. We had a group of others we would do that stuff with, but B took on more of a leadership role. After leading such a life with him for a while, he started to see me as an equal and someone to rely on. I really liked this because I always looked up to him and just wanted someone like him to be beside.



I, personally, wanted a chill life. He wanted a fun life full of thrill. The issue arises when he starts constantly getting hurt, and I'd have to take care of him. I started telling him to quit being so reckless, and told him the way he was living life wasn't really safe. He'd brush it off, and at some points almost got himself killed. I couldn't stand this cycle, and it constantly distressed me GREATLY. At that point in time, I was only in his group to make sure B stayed alive. 



Here's where I may be the asshole: I ultimately ended up sick and tired of having to make sure he stayed alive, sick of picking up the pieces. I ended up having a meeting arranged with B, but I tipped off to the police that he'd be there. I (obviously) left the group, and went on the run. I'm somewhere quite far away from where this all went down, and I've cut absolutely all contact with B.



I feel bad about what I did, but some of my friends are telling me I did the right thing. All I wanted was for him to live.

100,1eyb3f7,AITA if I walk out during my sisters wedding ceremony?,"So my sister 23F is getting married in like a week. She technically is already married and already had a ceremony, but they only had immediate family come to that one so they wanted to have another wedding ceremony for all the family and friends to witness, as well as a dinner at a nice restaurant and a backyard bbq afterwards. 

My sister and her fiancé (husband) are EXTREMELY religious. They are Christians. She started going to church with her husband (he was her boyfriend at the time) when she was 16 years old. She got really into it all really fast. I don’t have a problem with them being religious.

They do, however, have a problem with me being a lesbian. They are super sweet people and they never bring it up anymore, but they are homophobic and do not support me or the lgbtq community. 

At their previous ceremony, the pastor of their church was the one marrying them. He said a bunch of things I don’t agree with but to each their own. Unfortunately, he also nearly went into a negative speech about lgbtq people. I forget his exact words, but I know he was leading towards saying something like that because my mom said she was afraid he was going into that too. Thankfully the pastor stopped himself because I was the one videoing her wedding (I’m a professional videographer), and it would’ve been unfortunate for me to have to leave instead of recording the rest.

He is going to be the pastor at this upcoming ceremony as well. And I’m recording this ceremony also. Me and my mother are nervous the pastor will say something negative about lgbtq people. If it does come down to that, my mom said she will be leaving the ceremony, and so will I. AITA for leaving for that reason?


EDIT:
I forgot to put that I am 3 years younger than my sister. Not that it matters much, just more info and backstory.

I am NOT being paid for videoing and editing their wedding ceremony. I did the last one and was asked to do it again. I should have said no but I didn’t. If I do decide to leave the ceremony, I would leave my cameras on and recording. I would never be unprofessional like that, even if it’s my own sister and I’m not getting paid. I’d just give her the files unedited after. 

Also, after reading everyone responses, I have decided to talk to her about this whole thing before the wedding. I don’t want to cause a scene at my sisters wedding, that is not my intention in the slightest. I just see this as the final straw to everything she’s put me through over the years mentally regarding me being a lgbtq person.

I think that her wedding ceremony is not the time or place to be making comments about the lgbtq community. I have been to many wedding ceremonies as a professional videographer and photographer, none of which said anything about lgbtq people. I am just confused as to why the pastor finds it necessary to speak about this topic so frequently (lgbtq being a sin is a huge part of all of his Sunday speeches as well as all over his social media).

102,1eyaq29,AITA My fiance and I want to break the lease ,"My fiance (F23) and I (M26) want to break the lease with our roommates who are my sister(F20) and her boyfriend(M21). We moved in together in the middle of May this year into a spacious townhome. Prior to the move, we all laid out our own expectations for rules and how we should behave as housemates. The most important of those would be : 1. No use of marijuana in the house, dabs are fine as it doesn't stink up the place nor does it stain the walls. 2. Communicate whenever we are to have company over. And 3. Clean up after yourself.

The main points of contention would be as follows

Firstly, I work very long hours so I'm not around as much as I have to provide for my fiance as she is at home all the time as she is on break before attending college courses. She first brought to my attention the strange behavior my sisters boyfriend would exhibit such as: never leaving the home to work, paying rent in cash LATE so we have to spot him every month, he always comes back from his fathers house with a wad of cash to pay us back what we spotted him for rent.

Secondly, Her boyfriend would ASK us to have a brother (he has multiple and we will discuss that soon) over for the night with the added stipulation that it would only be for one night, but they'd be over for upwards of four days at a time. The main issue here is that we only have one shared living space that their guest would take over for the duration of their stay.

The third point of contention would be that one of his brothers is an addict. There was an occasion were my fiance went downstairs and found him FENT LEANING in our kitchen with the fridge wide open and him hunched over with his hands in the air and his face toward the ground. Obviously she wasn't comfortable with the situation and we pulled M(my sisters BF) aside to ask him about it and explain that we were uncomfortable with an addict in our shared home.

It's gotten so bad that we have to light candles and spray febreeze and wash the pillows and blankets that he uses.

Both of them have been lying to both me, my fiance, and my mother about his job situation for months. Recently my sister quit her job as well and they both stay in their room all day smoking weed and playing videogames. Rent is coming up and I have no clue what is going to happen this month. If I break the lease and buy my fiance and I out of the lease it would leave my sister and her boyfriend possibly in financial ruin as this is their first time renting, I've tried talking to my sister and her boyfriend separately many times but they continue to lie for each other. I'm at my wits end. I've considered moving forward and not looking back many times. Of course I love my sister and want the best for her but in a situation like this AITA for wanting to break the lease to save my sanity?

  
Edit:

For some more context, all four of us are on the lease.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-22,"AITA My fiance and I want to break the lease  My fiance (F23) and I (M26) want to break the lease with our roommates who are my sister(F20) and her boyfriend(M21). We moved in together in the middle of May this year into a spacious townhome. Prior to the move, we all laid out our own expectations for rules and how we should behave as housemates. The most important of those would be : 1. No use of marijuana in the house, dabs are fine as it doesn't stink up the place nor does it stain the walls. 2. Communicate whenever we are to have company over. And 3. Clean up after yourself.

The main points of contention would be as follows

Firstly, I work very long hours so I'm not around as much as I have to provide for my fiance as she is at home all the time as she is on break before attending college courses. She first brought to my attention the strange behavior my sisters boyfriend would exhibit such as: never leaving the home to work, paying rent in cash LATE so we have to spot him every month, he always comes back from his fathers house with a wad of cash to pay us back what we spotted him for rent.

Secondly, Her boyfriend would ASK us to have a brother (he has multiple and we will discuss that soon) over for the night with the added stipulation that it would only be for one night, but they'd be over for upwards of four days at a time. The main issue here is that we only have one shared living space that their guest would take over for the duration of their stay.

The third point of contention would be that one of his brothers is an addict. There was an occasion were my fiance went downstairs and found him FENT LEANING in our kitchen with the fridge wide open and him hunched over with his hands in the air and his face toward the ground. Obviously she wasn't comfortable with the situation and we pulled M(my sisters BF) aside to ask him about it and explain that we were uncomfortable with an addict in our shared home. His brother has been over many times since this incident and my fiance and I are convinced he is homeless as he has a very foul stench to him that lingers in the home even if he doesn't spend the night. It's gotten so bad that we have to light candles and spray febreeze and wash the pillows and blankets that he uses.

Just recently he cheated on her a second time and she finally broke up with him. This is when I found out that he was freeloading off of her and that we are soon to be evicted on the 5th of September. She apologizes profusely for how she acted to me and my friends for the past few months. We each sat her down and told her all of the awful things she has done to us and that she should take accountability for once and really truly apologize. She ended up apologizing.

A few days pass after the breakup and it seems like everything is going to be ok, we have a plan to catch up on the late payments that her ex-fiance owes and we are even planning to sue him for damages and money he owes to countless people. We both agreed to pay this large payment and be frugal for the next 2-3 weeks. It's like we were finally friends again.

Let it be known that I have a cat (3m) who I cherish dearly and he lives in the apartment with me. While I was at work today, I get a text from her saying that her friend found 2 stray kittens and that she will be immediately taking one in. As soon as she texted me this I was furious because we made a prior agreement that no animal is to be adopted until AFTER we pay off this debt that we owe.

I was worried about how my boyfriend would take the news because this last year his cat passed away due to complications with FeLV. When he heard the news he was furious because she invited this stray cat with no vaccination records or immunizations into the house.

When we got to the apartment tonight I knocked on her door and was immediately greeted with ""I don't see what the big f*cking deal is"" to which I unloaded on her and practically screamed in her face that she is putting my cats life at risk because she doesn't even know what this cat could have.

I (31F) am getting married on September 28th, and a friend (31F) has agreed to make the cake in payment for a few times I helped her out with babysitting, a few years back...I have told her repeatedly that I don't need any payment but she says that she HAS to give me something, and she enjoys baking.

My wedding is themed after Up and originally, I was just going to have a 2-tier and use my Up topper...but being ever concerned about being a burden, as well as a craft loving individual, I changed my request to a single tier with 3-dozen balloon cupcakes as I felt like it would make things easier for her, and give me the opportunity to build a display to show  off the in theme cake and cupcakes.

BUT...prior to the wedding I am extremely busy and have a bunch of crafts to finish, and am worried that I won't have time to finish all of them and my display in time... I have a Disneyland vacation and a cruise within just two weeks of each other and then my wedding a little over a week after I returned from the second trip I'm very tightly scheduled.

I am aware that the wedding timing was poorly arranged, but due to family health deteriorating and other circumstances...later in the next few months just wasn't feasible either.

I have a few friends who are telling me that I would be a bit asshole-ish to ask her to change plans AGAIN, but others who are saying that since she offered to make the cake she should expect ""bride brain"" and for me to change my mind.

107,1eya1f9,AITA for telling my brother I don't want other people to know he is my brother in high school,"Hi. I am 17F and I have a brother that is 12 and we will be going to the same high school soon.

The other day, I told him I don't want people to know we're siblings.

My brother is an iPad kid who always plays mobile games like Roblox. He also plays on his laptop, watches YouTube, and other activities. However, he does this excessively; he would play games the whole day, and I mean 5-8 hours a day.

This has been happening for at least 3 years now. My parents have tried everything they can to stop my brother from literally being addicted to games. They have scolded him, taken his devices away, and even severely shouted at him, but nothing works. He ignores everything my parents say, and when my parents take the devices away, he either takes them back or annoys them during their work hours (they work at home) until they give the devices back to him. Furthermore, he has a severe case of spoiled brat attitude, and since he is entering puberty, he has a stuck-up, ""nobody cares about me,"" and ""you guys are all against me attitude"" around all of us. Additionally, my brother has horrible grades, and with the current trajectory he is going, he will be failing all his classes or getting C's and D's. Worst of all, he has nothing else in his life; no sports, no hobbies, no passions, no social skills, literally nothing.

Since he is entering the same school I am, I do not want to be associated with him. In my current high school, all the teachers like me, I have good leadership positions, and my GPA is decently high. However, once he enters, I feel like he will be horrible in his classes. Although he won't directly insult the teachers, he probably won't do his homework, fail most of his tests, and if the teachers are strict, he is the type to purposely hand in a black test paper because he doesn't like them. Worst case, if he really doesn't like the teacher, he will talk back at them and give them the look that pisses all teachers off.

I worry that if it's known I’m his sister, I'll be obligated to help him, especially if my teacher makes a comments about it. Furthermore, if he does become rude to the teachers, they will have a subconscious negative perception of me, which in some cases hurts my recommendation letters and my grades. If my brother becomes infamously rude and annoying, I feel like my friends will always mention it like ""oh hey why is your brother Steve so unlike you"" or ""hey did you hear what your brother did today,"" and I will suddenly become responsible cleaning up my brother's every actions and its consequences. I don't want my brother's reputation to stain what I have built for four years. I guess I am selfishly asking him not to be associated with me because he is, in my eyes, an embarrassment both to society and to my family. In my heart, he is still my brother, but I see him as a lost cause that isn't willing to help himself, and I don't want to be pressured to help him.

WIBTA if I choose to not associate with him in high school?

Edit:

I see a lot of comments saying I'm the AH and it's quite a reality check. I appreciate it.

I wrote this in a fit of rage because my parents got into an argument again over my brother and I also got shouted at so I was just really mad at him and I felt the need to blow off some steam.

I think I should clarify some things: I just don't want to be around him in high school, but I won't bully him. I want to help him, and I've tried in the past but it never worked out. My parents work a lot of over time so they sometimes don't have the time or energy to help my brother, and I'm guessing they're basing off how I came out so they expect my brother to be more responsible.

I know a lot of the issues for my brother is more complex and I don't want to expose that in a Reddit post since that's more for therapists. But I suppose more of my main problem is that I don't want him to keep on acting like this, but he isn't willing to change no matter what method we tried. And this isn't just affecting him, but it's also affecting how our family functions because now a lot of times my parents argue a lot and I also get entangled into it. So I'm hoping that ppl on Reddit will help with that because I really don't know what to do.

Edit #2: I wanted to clarify our ages. I am born 2007 and my brother is born 2011. So when he is in grade 8, I will be in grade 12. I think I should also clarify that these are more of my internal thoughts. I've never said these words to him because we don't really talk much.

Edit #3: I've been reading the comments for an hour or two and I've also been replying to some. It's getting quite late and I don't want to stay up too late so yeah. I'll just say some last thoughts:

I'll try talking to my parents about just letting me take the devices. It's summer right now so there isn't homework, but I'll try help my brother with homework but I hope he can gain some new friends that will study with him instead of having me. I actually never said ""I don't want other people to know you are my brother,"" but because AITA doesn't allow non-action things so I made it so I did. I just wanted to see the general opinion of my potential future actions. I realized that yeah, I'm a pretty asshole of a sister, and I'll try to change by following some of the advice on Reddit. But I think that the situation is too complicated for people on Reddit to really understand and there are too many details that can't really be written out on a Reddit post, so I might ask some of my friends because they understand my family situation a bit better.

I think there is a lot of serious underlying issues with my family, and I acknowledge that. I understand some of the things my brother is going through because I also went through that-- after all we live in the same household. I guess that also makes me more of an asshole knowing what he is going through but not helping.

I always thought the methods my parents use will be useful to him since it was useful against me, but I think Reddit gave me a new perception on that. I also never really thought being 12 is that young, but the comments allowed more insight into that. 

I'll try my best to be a better sister from now on. Our relationship isn't negative per-say, it's just stagnant, kind of like roommates with occasional fights. But I'll try to talk to him about life in general. 

Thanks for the comments. Some of them were mean, some were brutally honest, and some were both. But I think that they helped me a bit on at least what my next steps should be.

I'm also the type to delete Reddit accounts in a day or two so this post will likely be gone soon, but thanks for the advice.

109,1ey9omr,AITA For not attending my friends wedding ,"I (30F) have been very close with a friend of a friend, Sasha (35F), for the past 10 years. We've shared countless experiences—dinners, concerts, trips, family gatherings—you name it. We've supported each other through break-ups and various life challenges. About two years ago, Sasha met David (39M). Although I didn't get a great vibe from him and found him to be manipulative and controlling, I tried to be supportive because she loves him. Now, they’re engaged and planning a destination wedding in Tulum for February 2025.

I was initially excited for Sasha and began making plans to attend. However, my financial and living situation has changed since the announcement, making it difficult for me to afford the trip. I tried to explain my situation to Sasha in advance, but this led to a heated argument. She told me I should try harder to save money, even though I’ve exhausted all possible options. This disagreement has caused us not to speak for several months.

I feel terrible about potentially missing such a significant event in Sasha's life, especially since I’ve been present for everything up to now. I even considered using a financing option like Affirm to cover the costs but am hesitant to incur more debt. What should I do? Am I the asshole in this situation?

111,1ey9n66,WIBTA because I(M18) want to tell my white roommate(M19) that his food smells horrible,"I know how that title sounds so hear me out please. So here's some really important context: I'm a freshman in college of a more chubby build, and my roommate Josh is a sophomore who looks like he goes to the gym. I recently moved into my college dorm and it was rather stressful, but I have been settled in for a couple of days now. Our dorm is separated with a total of five small rooms consisting of, our bedrooms, split bathrooms(1 shower, 1 toilet) and a entry room. Also I LOVE foods from different cultures, as I have been to China, Spain, the Caribbean, and Israel for two week stays and never had a problem eating; this is not a cultural issue. My roommate Josh honestly seems like a pretty chill person. Plus he has already taken a year in college and that set me at ease for a lot of my worries.  

However, he set up his Fridge and Microwave in the entry room. I thought it a little odd, but I don't care, especially because I don't plan on staying in my dorm for excessive amounts of time and were only here for 8 months. Here is the list of problems that I have noticed over the past few days:  

* After using the microwave, he hasn't cleaned up his crumbs. I don't want to have to deal with ants in our dorm room. I cleaned them up one time, but haven't since and there was crumbs last I checked.
* He has left out whole blue berries before, and similar to the crumbs, he didn't clean it up.
* He leaves his Protein powder container open, which of course, will lead to ants.

While these are annoying and problematic long term, I feel like that conversation would not be difficult, my actual biggest issue is the food he prepares. Late in the night(around 10:30-11:15ish) he reheats this premade chicken and it smells so bad. It smells like the most decrepit thing has crawled out of its hole while being doused in six thousand piles of shit. I genuinely cannot stress enough how horrible this smells. I'm actually thinking that he's eating rotted chicken.

I would not care what kind of food he eats or when as long as it didn't impact my room. I can smell it in my room all day long, and it is making me actually hate being in my dorm room when I need to go to sleep. Even when walking by our room you can smell the food from outside and it is not appealing. I tried putting up some air-fresheners in the other four rooms but to no avail. I want to ask him to move his microwave & fridge into his room, because at least then there is a less likely chance that it spreads throughout the entire dorm. I feel like I'm being irrational with this request, but at the same time I don't want to hate the place I am going to have to live in for the next couple of months.

I know that this is me projecting my own insecurities, but I feel like people are going to quickly judge the ""fat kid"" for being the smelly one, especially if its between a fat kid and a ""gym bro"" because it has happened to me before. I talked to one of my friends and he said that I would be an asshole because its a shared living space between us and I don't have the right to tell him to move it out of the entry room into his room, since its equally ours. But I feel like because its a shared living area, I am able to ask him to move the microwave out of there and into a space where it won't affect the entire dorm.

112,1ey9fou,AITAH for taking my allotted vacation time? ,"I (40nb) work at a hospitality job and was offered a salaried management position 18 months ago, that came with two weeks paid vacation, and medical benefits. Since I was offered the position, i have routinely worked the minimum hours required (40), and a lot of times, beyond. I informed my employer my plan was to take a weeks vacation, every 6 months, which was well within my offered benefits. 

Cut to today, when I was told that my employer was frustrated and annoyed that I had taken two vacations this year (one in January, the other was last week), complaining ‘When do *I* get to take a vacation??’. I also ended up with COVID in May, and a dirty bout of gastro in September. This frustration from my employer came directly on the heels of several of my responsibilities being taken away, after the GM left, and then returned, taking the job back. 

By no means is it an excuse, but in the last year, my mental health has taken a massive hit with my previously diagnosed issues (depression/anxiety)… but also finding out I need to be assessed for both adhd AND autism, which has really added a weight on my shoulders. I find if I don’t take a break from work, I get overwhelmed, and severely burned out, hence taking a vacation every 6 months. 

Am I the Asshole for taking a weeks vacation as allotted by my employer, for what’s left of my sanity? Or was taking a vacation the wrong thing to do, since I ended up out of commission for illness for a total of 7 calendar days?

114,1ey92ip,AITA for starting a fight with my mom over brownies?,"Hey, this is my first post. I downloaded Reddit just to ask for advice on this, so I'd appreciate any help!
I'm an 18-year-old girl living with my uncle (24), grandma (61), mom (39), and great-grandma. My mom has never been one for working—she hasn't taken care of me financially or emotionally. My uncle and grandma provide for the household. 
I love baking and often make sweet treats for my family. Since they buy the ingredients, I rarely ask for help. My mom doesn't work and doesn't help around the house either. She stays in her room, often getting up only after lunch, and expects us to do everything for her because ""we're family, and family loves unconditionally.""
Today, I made brownies. While I was downstairs, I heard her on a Facetime call with her fiancé, showing off the brownies and saying, ""Look, babe, the brownies my beloved daughter made!"" She'd already eaten a piece earlier and mentioned saving some for him, which I don't mind since he often saves treats for me.
However, she eats a lot of the sweets I bake, often more than anyone else, leaving me with little of what I made. It bothers me because she has never cooked anything for me in my 18 years. I don't expect her to be a great cook, but at 39, living off her mother, she should at least try to contribute.
As she approached the platter, I told her, ""Just don't eat the whole thing like last time."" I admit my tone wasn't friendly, but I wasn't lying—she never thinks about others. She blew up, saying she never eats more than the rest of us, then stormed upstairs. A bit later, I heard her yelling on the phone to her fiancé, saying things like, ""Do you deny food to your mother? This girl needs an exorcism; she's a monster!""
It hurt, but my mom and I have never gotten along. I resent her for not being there for me, even when she had the time. My grandparents and uncle made sure I grew up happy, but now my mom tries to act friendly, and it feels fake. It’s hard to believe it when I go from being her ""beloved daughter"" to a ""monster who needs an exorcism"" so quickly. 

Anyway, I’d appreciate some advice. Am I in the wrong here?

115,1ey8rxa,WIBTAH for how I feel like I’m about to snap at my so called “friend”,"
I 14 F have a “friend”, ( he is 10 months younger than me so 13) and I put that in quotes because he doesn’t act like a friend whatsoever. ( and no I can’t just stop being friends with him our moms are best friends, and his mom lets me ride her horse) So for a little back story to why I feel like I’m about to snap at him, I have been shooting archery for about 10 month so not very long, and he’s been shooting for about 8-9 years, a lot longer than me. And we shoot together about 2 times a week, I am totally fine shooting with him and shooting with him is not what is about to make me snap. 

It’s the comments he makes and the things he does, here are some of the comments he makes and theses are almost his exact words, there are also many more but most I want add just because they were straight up sexual joke and 100% inappropriate “I should try to hit and break your 2 dollar arrows with my 20 dollar arrows just to break them. So (for the sake of this I’ll call myself E) E won’t be able to shoot at state” (we have a state competition where I need my arrows this weekend his dad said “let’s put you all on different targets so you guys don’t break arrows”) He has also said “I should tip over and break your bow” (I have a very expensive set up that all together costs around 4-5000) and I have no sense of direction so unless I’m in my house and can point to where my horse pasture is (“your horse always eats to the east” is how I remember what what way east is) and he has decided that is his favorite thing to make fun of as well as the fact that I am tone deaf, and some of the things he had done is mess with my bow when I was shooting, and when I do good and beat him, or he doesn’t do as good as he wanted, he gets super mad and won’t talk to anyone I can’t even describe how pissed off he gets it’s honestly something that you have to experience to know how bad it is, but it’s bad enough that my mom and dad even make comments about it. But today he made the comment “I want to break all of E’s arrows just so she can’t shoot at state and I’ll beat her” (and he is old enough to know these comments are wrong, as well as he also doesn’t make those comments when we’re with people that are sponsored or are really good” and that comment just pissed me off and he’s been making comments like that all the time, and I just don’t know if I can deal with it anymore.  

I was talking with my dad on the way home from shooting, and he said “I get it you have brushed it off for a long time but he’s just getting rude it’s not funny or cute anymore it’s just mean. Next time he does it snap back and say” “Are you really so scared I’m going to beat you that you have to try to get into my head so you can beat me.” And I don’t really want to but at the same time I do. (I do also realize how lucky I am to have all the opportunities with my bow set up and all the shoots I’ve been able to go to but he also has a really good set up and good coaches he is also a spokesman for the bow brand Expedition) So WIBTAH if I snapped next time he makes a comment like that?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-22,"WIBTAH for how I feel like I’m about to snap at my so called “friend”

It’s the comments he makes and the things he does, here are some of the comments he makes and theses are almost his exact words, there are also many more but most I want add just because they were straight up sexual joke and 100% inappropriate “I should try to hit and break your 2 dollar arrows with my 20 dollar arrows just to break them. So (for the sake of this I’ll call myself E) E won’t be able to shoot at state” (we have a state competition where I need my arrows this weekend his dad said “let’s put you all on different targets so you guys don’t break arrows”) He has also said “I should tip over and break your bow” (I have a very expensive set up that all together costs around 4-5000) and I have no sense of direction so unless I’m in my house and can point to where my horse pasture is (“your horse always eats to the east” is how I remember what what way east is) and he has decided that is his favorite thing to make fun of as well as the fact that I am tone deaf, and some of the things he had done is mess with my bow when I was shooting, and when I do good and beat him, or he doesn’t do as good as he wanted, he gets super mad and won’t talk to anyone I can’t even describe how pissed off he gets it’s honestly something that you have to experience to know how bad it is, but it’s bad enough that my mom and dad even make comments about it. But today he made the comment “I want to break all of E’s arrows just so she can’t shoot at state and I’ll beat her” (and he is old enough to know these comments are wrong, as well as he also doesn’t make those comments when we’re with people that are sponsored or are really good” and that comment just pissed me off and he’s been making comments like that all the time, and I just don’t know if I can deal with it anymore.  

I was talking with my dad on the way home from shooting, and he said “I get it you have brushed it off for a long time but he’s just getting rude it’s not funny or cute anymore it’s just mean. Next time he does it snap back and say” “Are you really so scared I’m going to beat you that you have to try to get into my head so you can beat me.” And I don’t really want to but at the same time I do. (I do also realize how lucky I am to have all the opportunities with my bow set up and all the shoots I’ve been able to go to but he also has a really good set up and good coaches he is also a spokesman for the bow brand Expedition) So WIBTAH if I snapped next time he makes a comment like that?",0.0,0.048256866633892,0,1

We got very close very fast and our friendship ended up getting to the point of hanging out every day, that was until about last summer when she told me she started dating a guy who bullied me. To give some context, I’ve been bullied very heavily in public school, and my freshman year was so bad that I now do online school. I almost considered ending my life around that time, and I suffer from severe ptsd and anxiety due to the bullying and torment. My friend was obviously aware that this boy bullied me along with his friends and when I confronted her on why she would date him she said “well he never did anything to me” and I just ended up staying quiet about the subject after that. They eventually broke up so it’s not a topic of conversation anymore. But now, she’s made multiple friends with other people who bullied me, some of which took pictures of me and posted them to social media. She obviously didn’t understand why I was upset about that either, and once again, I let it slide, because I didn’t want her to be upset, or make it seem like I don’t want her to have other friends. Now, about 6 months ago, she started saying really weird things to me and our other mutual friend. Saying things along the lines of “if it was the 40s I would have such a big crush on h1tler” or “I have blonde hair and blue eyes so I’m an aryan” and other things exclaiming how she idolized n@zis and obviously me and our other friend got super uncomfortable. We thought it was jokes so ONCE AGAIN, we decided not to say anything. But when this summer started I was shown something that genuinely disgusted me. One of her friends had written out a list of “funny” things she’s said and the things in this list were “why are fat people so awful?” And “I hate black people we should send them all to Africa” my friend sent me this list and I was really disgusted. Me and our mutual friend decided it would be best to not talk to her anymore because of the behavior, but I’m starting to feel bad. She has a terrible home situation, and she has always been very dependent on me and my family for a place to stay, or a place to get a home cooked meal.

117,1ey8b3b,AITA for asking my college roommate to get rid of her emotional support animal,"One of my roommates, lets call her Patty, brought her family’s dog into our college apartment where four of us college-aged girls live. For context, we live in a two bedroom, 700 sq ft, high-rise apartment. She initially said this would be for a short period before a school break. She instead brought the dog up after said break and never took her back home. The dog has severe anxiety, as well as my roommate, who told the leasing company that the dog is her “emotional support animal”.

However, after the past few months our roommate has never touched our vacuum and this dog sheds like a sheep being sheared. Similarly, she will go out usually three to four times every week from 8 p.m.-3 a.m while locking the dog in her bedroom. In the middle of the night, we can hear the dog whining and barking. While the dog is walked usually once or twice daily, we all can’t help but feel like they aren’t getting out enough to use the bathroom and get their energy out.

Our breaking point was this summer, when she decided to have her friend dog-sit and stay over without our knowledge for about two weeks. Since it was summer, none of my other roommates were staying at the apartment. I decided, knowing she was on vacation, to check in on the place, clean, and move some of my things back up. I arrived to discover someone was staying there and had keys to the place. As I was putting things away that were thrown about our living space, including dirty laundry and random bags of snacks, I noticed in Patty’s shared bedroom that my other roommate’s bed was obviously slept in. Furthermore, there were two vibrators being charged on this roommate’s (Sam’s) desk. Patty’s side of the room was a mess but seemingly untouched including her perfectly made bed.

I had the pleasure of asking Sam if she had been up to the apartment over summer break. I told her about my suspicions that someone had been using her bed. She confronted both the dog-sitter and Patty over text. The dog-sitter claimed she had been given permission by Patty to use the bed while Patty said she never told her to use her space. 

While we know this is going to be a hard request, my other roommates and I feel as though we need a break from having the dog at our apartment. Between being stuck with dog for months longer than we expected to having personal space violations, we feel like we need to work on the basics of communication and responsibility as roommates before reintroducing any animals.

my dad told me we could at least go to this resort that’s in his home town (nowhere near the taj mahal) but i figured it would still be a vacation in some sort.

today i asked again about our plans bc i wanted to book the resort today. he says my mom doesn’t want to go there and instead wants to shop and go to the beach.

119,1ey89ab,AITA for cancelling on last minute plans with my best friend? ,"My best friend and I have been friends for more than 10 years. On Sunday night we made plans for Monday after both of us got off of work in the afternoon.

She wanted the plan to be for me to drive 1hr-1hr 30 minutes each way so that we could eat at a nice restaurant in the nearest big city (Toronto) (she doesn’t drive nor would I ask her for gas money as we have been friends for so long) Initially I said no as I have a busy work week for the rest of the week and Monday afternoon would be the only afternoon I’d have to myself to get house chores and various tasks done and didn’t want to spend more than half of my day off this week driving. 

She didn’t seem happy with any other plans and basically convinced me we would come home early if we just went there to eat and come back. 

The morning rolls around (7:30), I wake up feeling tired and message her that I’m really not up for a far drive today so we should just do something nearby. 2 hours later I give her some suggestions as to what we should do that wouldn’t involve as much traffic. No reply. She was at work as well so that could’ve contributed to her inability to reply but it doesn’t take much to just sneak away and reply if the plan suggestions I made are okay with her. After I clocked out at 12:30 pm I told her that maybe it’s best if I just stay home today and plan something for another day. She was done from work at 2. 

She sends a petty message: “ Alsooo yaaa can u like lmk if u gonna cancel the night before cuzzz i already passed up other plans 😁” In my opinion this tone of this message was very petty and condescending. 

MIND YOU, we went out less than a week ago. I suggested we get our nails done and get food and we did exactly that and various other spontaneous plans the last few weeks when I’ve had time. I understand she wanted me to let her know earlier but the night before I thought sure why not.

As the afternoon rolls around, we have no idea what we’re doing and I’m anxious thinking about how I’m going to get everything done this week. I thought it would just be best to chill out and plan something for another day. 

She started writing a long paragraph about “all I do is waste her time” “I don’t prioritize her “ etc etc. Within this paragraph she also called me a “dumbass” and a “bitch” when I told her there have been times when she plans her day according to unconfirmed plans with her “friends with benefits” which he confirms the day of. I see her almost every week and call/text when we don’t. I can wholeheartedly say that I try my best to balance work, home, family, friends, school and dating and it honestly gets very exhausting at times as many people know. I have no other plans this week and had to say no to a few other people. 

Anyway, after our long argument and her stonewalling me, I check her location and lo and behold she was out and made other plans after I supposedly ruined the rest of her day since I cancelled on her. Yesterday, a day after our argument, she went to a Toronto restaurant with another friend and posted it on her story. Today, she went out with another friend. 

Now she hasn’t been talking to me, and I seriously don’t understand what I did that was so bad. Out of the hundreds of plans we’ve made, I’ve cancelled last minute on a very small percentage of them. I’m thinking of just waiting it out but being stonewalled is seriously frustrating.

My parents are swinger's and when I was 14 they fell in love with another couple and decided to move in with them. 

In the house was myself, my brother, my parents, the other couple and their 2 boys. There was a lot of fighting and overall was really toxic. 

They lived together for 15 years until the woman (let's say Eve) from the other couple passed away from bone cancer.

After Eve died everything changed in the family. Originally my mother and father were going to stay together and move out. 
However, my mom decided she didn't want to move out and leave the other man (let's say Frank). 

They decided to get a divorce, however, a month or so later they appeared to reconcile and moved out together. 
After 3 or so weeks my mom decides to go back to Frank and leave my dad. 
I found out she was still talking to Frank even though she was trying to reconcile with my father the whole time. 
Now, it's been almost 2 years since I saw the other family including Frank. 

I understand relationships don't work out for everyone. I don't hold that against her but her going behind his back really upset us.

121,1ey7ypi,AITA for not letting my friend crash at my place even though I crashed at his before?,"I (26F) have a good friend from college (26M) who moved to a different city a couple years ago. When I went to visit that city last year, I stayed at his place for a week. He recently moved in with his partner, so they have a big apartment with a spare room for me to stay in, and his partner is honestly the person who did a lot of the work to make me feel welcome (she's the one who made sure the bedroom was set up, provided me with clean sheets and a towel, etc.) I also followed all the basic rules of decency when staying as a guest at someone's place -- not being loud, cleaning up after myself, making sure I come back to their place at a reasonable hour at night so I'm not keeping them up, etc. My friend, however, is the opposite kind of guest.

My friend has come to visit my city a couple times already and crashed with me once before for a few nights. I knew from college that he can be insanely messy and inconsiderate of other people's spaces, but I figured by now he'd have learned to at least be clean as a guest. But nope, in the few days he spent with me he left piles of dirty dishes, empty takeout containers lying around, he spread all of his belongings across my apartment so that I was constantly tripping over things--you get the picture. I also stay in a tiny studio apartment in New York, so having someone stay at my place gets exhausting a lot faster since there's no place to be alone.

My friend recently asked if he could stay with me for a week, and I said no as politely as I could, mainly focusing on the fact that I live in a studio and it gets too cramped having someone else there for a whole week. He got really upset, pointing out that I'd just stayed at HIS place for a week very recently. I tried to gently tell him it was also because of the kind of mess he makes when he stays over, and he said he'd just be sure to clean up after himself this time. He's said this before though--the last time he stayed with me when I asked him to help clean up, he half-heartedly did a couple things (tossed out a bit of trash, washed a couple plates), but proceeded to let more mess pile up. I told him I didn't want to spend a week nitpicking and chasing after him to do those things, cause it would probably just end up with both of us being pissed off at each other. My friend got pissed and said he thought we were good enough friends to let the little things go, especially after I was so well taken care of when I came to visit him. At this point I got angry too and told him that HE wasn't the reason I was well taken care of, it was his girlfriend who did all the work, and that if he could just grow up and clean up after himself like an adult we wouldn't be in this situation.

I know the last part was pretty harsh and I feel bad now for being so rigid--maybe I could've just put up with this for a week since it's for a good friend?

He recently moved in with his partner, so they have a big apartment with a spare room for me to stay in, and his partner is honestly the person who did a lot of the work to make me feel welcome (she's the one who made sure the bedroom was set up, provided me with clean sheets and a towel, etc.) I also followed all the basic rules of decency when staying as a guest at someone's place -- not being loud, cleaning up after myself, making sure I come back to their place at a reasonable hour at night so I'm not keeping them up, etc. My friend, however, is the opposite kind of guest.

My friend has come to visit my city a couple times already and crashed with me once before for a few nights. I knew from college that he can be insanely messy and inconsiderate of other people's spaces, but I figured by now he'd have learned to at least be clean as a guest. But nope, in the few days he spent with me he left piles of dirty dishes, empty takeout containers lying around, he spread all of his belongings across my apartment so that I was constantly tripping over things--you get the picture. I also stay in a tiny studio apartment in New York, so having someone stay at my place gets exhausting a lot faster since there's no place to be alone.

My friend recently asked if he could stay with me for a week, and I said no as politely as I could, mainly focusing on the fact that I live in a studio and it gets too cramped having someone else there for a whole week. He got really upset, pointing out that I'd just stayed at HIS place for a week very recently. I tried to gently tell him it was also because of the kind of mess he makes when he stays over, and he said he'd just be sure to clean up after himself this time. He's said this before though--the last time he stayed with me when I asked him to help clean up, he half-heartedly did a couple things (tossed out a bit of trash, washed a couple plates), but proceeded to let more mess pile up. I told him I didn't want to spend a week nitpicking and chasing after him to do those things, cause it would probably just end up with both of us being pissed off at each other. My friend got pissed and said he thought we were good enough friends to let the little things go, especially after I was so well taken care of when I came to visit him. At this point I got angry too and told him that HE wasn't the reason I was well taken care of, it was his girlfriend who did all the work, and that if he could just grow up and clean up after himself like an adult we wouldn't be in this situation.

I know the last part was pretty harsh and I feel bad now for being so rigid--maybe I could've just put up with this for a week since it's for a good friend? So am I the asshole for being harsh and telling my friend he can't stay with me?",0.0,0.0795322880148887,0,1

To start, I don't like people coming up behind me. Whenever someone does, I have a sort of fight or flight reaction. But my fight and flight happens at the same time.

124,1ey7bmk,AITA for slipping on Sisters husband,"Throwaway account as both my sister and husband have my main account.

Background: I (27F) have been married to my husband, 'Jake' (29M) for five years and my sister, 'Anna' (32F) has beenp married to 'Cody' (36M) for seven and they have a child who's five. 

During my childhood, it's been clear Anna was jealous of me in some way or another...she has some body image issues and basically projected it onto me because I was 'younger' and I have a slimmer body and a bigger chest than her. I tried not to take her awful comments to heart because I knew she was struggling even though I was told multiple times to cover up my chest around her by our mum because it made her insecure. This also took a hit in my mental health as I wasn't able to express myself much due to having to always be careful of Anna's feelings. Eventually, Anna went to therapy in her early adulthood and I no longer felt like I had to walk around her on eggshells. After years, I truly felt that she no longer had any jealous feelings towards me.

Fast forward to this week, Our whole family (our parents, Anna and her family and my husband and I) went for a vacation to a beach and it was just an afternoon where we were having drinks before going out for a swim so we were in our swimsuits already. I decided to pass the drinks out and Cody stood up to help me as I was carrying a heavy tray, the action startled me a bit and I tripped over my own foot and I fell on top of him, both of us crashing to the ground. I immediately got up and apologised while grabbing his hand to pull him up.

Everyone was shocked, my husband standing up quickly to help. Suddenly, Anna just storms out of the room and Cody and mum follow her in confusion. I didn't think much at first, I was more focused on cleaning up. As I clean up, Jake starts making comments like ""that was really inappropriate of you"" and I was like huh? What do you mean? turns out he was on about how my chest was pressed up against Cody as we fell. I couldn't believe what I was hearing and just ignored him. Once I cleaned, I headed out to Anna to see what’s wrong and I came to see her crying. Cody and mum are trying to comfort her. I ask what's wrong and she starts screaming at me, calling me a homewrecker and a whore for the same reason my husband was angry at me earlier. I was shocked and so was Cody, he was adamant that it was nothing and he didn't even notice and I said the same. She didn't listen and just kept calling me a whore so I just lost it and started screaming at her back, spilling everything I felt from childhood and I can't believe she's still projecting on some freak accident. The whole thing was a mess and I was eventually taken out.
Jake, my mum and Anna are not talking to me while Cody and Anna keep arguing, causing their child to cry. Right now, I'm just trying to comfort their child, while feeling totally miserable. All because I tripped, it's caused the whole day to be ruined.

125,1ey75s9,AITA for not being able to deal with my bipolar mom?,"I've always had a good relationship with my mom. However, the past few weeks have been hard for me.

She's bipolar and for all of my life I've seen her have some awful episodes and 3 hospitalizations. When I was 18 she got pregnant from her good for nothing now ex-husband. I used to think he was okay, but proved himself otherwise. When they found out about the pregnancy they had just broken up, but ended up going back together because of the baby. With the news, her having to adjust her meds and the pregnancy hormones got her in a terrible mental state, specially because we were going through a tough time financially. He never showed up in that area, being supported by her since he moved in with us.   
  
During the pregnancy she had terrible episodes and started to not trust him on a really deep level, which I get, and that was when I started being her main ""caregiver"", always talking to her and being the one who would get things done whenever something happened i.e. her running away without telling anyone because she didn't feel supported.

Now, she's separated from him and couldn't get full custody of the child because he made the judges think she was not mentally able to do so. Which is a lie, she is a great mom, but has her issues. But now she has to live by herself and she's not being able to do so because she feels lonely and is demanding a lot of attention from me, but after all of these years and harsh things I've gone through because of the episodes and all of the drama envolving the break up, I kind of can't take it anymore. She wants help, but doesn't help herself, she has some unhealthy habits, says she can't eat or sleep because she's lonely. I think she has to develop some independence, and fight for herself. She stopped therapy but went back to smoking (which in the end of the month costs just as much as therapy). So it's been really hard for me to give her as much attention because I'm tired of being her emotional support. 

  
This week I told her this and she said that she doesn't demand so much of me, to which i replied that it might not be much to her, but it has been for me. 

  
AITA for no longer being able to help her anymore? I'm scared she might try to off herself for the 5th time, but I also can't keep on being like her therapist or something. It's been annoying to be by her side because it seems like nothing helps, and as a result sometimes I end up telling her off for not taking care of herself and living in self-pity, so it might be best to keep some distance rather than not being so nice to her.

I poured my heart into planning and my mom (f57) continuously made me feel like trash all week. Here are the examples: 

- she was mad because the shower wasn't what she wanted, but what my sister-in-law wanted (continued to yell at me because ""she didn't get to choose the shower she wanted and she was just grateful that people threw her a shower"", implying that SisterIn Law wouldn't have been grateful for the shower)

- she was mad because the shower date wasn't what she wanted, but it was the only date that worked for the baby mom, without the potential for the shower being after the due date 
     - my mom did not understand why she didn’t want the shower after the due date and was mad that she didn’t want the shower after the due date. 

- she yelled at ME because my brother (m40) wanted alcohol at the shower (then accused me of supporting his desire for that, which I never said I was in support. I said I didn't want to be in the middle of it.)

- she was mad because the shower wasn't what she wanted, but what my sister-in-law wanted (continued to yell at me because ""she didn't get to choose the shower she wanted and she was just grateful that people threw her a shower"", implying that SisterIn Law wouldn't have been grateful for the shower)

- she was mad because the shower date wasn't what she wanted, but it was the only date that worked for the baby mom, without the potential for the shower being after the due date 
     - my mom did not understand why she didn’t want the shower after the due date and was mad that she didn’t want the shower after the due date. 

- she yelled at ME because my brother (m40) wanted alcohol at the shower (then accused me of supporting his desire for that, which I never said I was in support. I said I didn't want to be in the middle of it.)

135,1ey5739,WIBTA for telling my mother-in-law to stop calling my 2-year-old daughter a brat and a drama queen?," 
My wife (mid 30s) and I (mid 30s) live in Canada. We have a 2-year-old daughter who, like most toddlers, is curious, active, and has her share of meltdowns. Overall, she’s just doing what toddlers do as they figure out the world around them.

My in-laws live in Asia and are currently visiting us. They’ve met our daughter before during previous visits, but this time around, my mother-in-law has been making comments that really bother me. She keeps calling our daughter a ""brat"" and a ""drama queen"" whenever she cries, throws a tantrum, or even just acts out in typical toddler fashion. It’s gotten to the point where those words are now being thrown around casually.

This rubs me the wrong way. I don’t like those labels being put on my daughter, especially since she’s so young and doesn’t even understand what’s being said. I’m also concerned about what kind of impact these negative labels could have on her if they continue, even if she’s not fully aware right now.

I spoke to my wife about it, and she agrees with me. We both believe these comments are uncalled for and inappropriate, and she told her mom to stop saying them. My mother-in-law’s response? She told my wife, ""I’ll just say it when he’s not around."" That really pissed me off. It feels like she’s being intentionally disrespectful, both to me and our parenting decisions.

My wife thinks it’s best to just let her keep handling it to avoid any family drama, but I feel like if my mother-in-law isn’t taking her seriously, I should step in and set a clear boundary myself. I don’t want these kinds of negative labels attached to my daughter, especially from her own grandmother. 

On the other hand, I know this could create tension during the rest of their visit, and I don’t want to sour the relationship between me, my wife, and her family. But honestly, I’m fed up with hearing these remarks and don’t want to stay silent anymore.

So, WIBTA if I told my mother-in-law directly to stop calling my daughter a brat and a drama queen, even if it could cause some friction, or should I just let my wife continue addressing it?
