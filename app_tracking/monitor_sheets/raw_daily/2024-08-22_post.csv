0,1ey8xor,AITA for being mad that my friend got my art tattooed without asking?,"Hello, I, (21, nonbinary) have a friend (Male, 40), who just recently decided to “surprise” me, by getting an art piece of mine tattooed on his leg.

I want to start out by saying I’m flattered that he cares enough about me to do it. Him and I have been friends for probably a couple years now. We’ve only ever talked online, and it was made clear as soon as we started talking, I was not romantically interested in him. We message each other maybe a few times a week, just to check in on each other, let each other know we are there for each other, and then continue on with the day. 

The only time it was ever more than that was when he lost his father, and his sister both, in which we got a little more chatty with each other, just so I could help him through the hard time. 

I am an artist, I’ve been drawing since I was 14, but I am BY NO MEANS a professional. I don’t sell my work, and don’t believe it’s anywhere NEAR good enough to be on someone’s body permanently. He’s made jokes before about getting my art tattooed on him, and I always told him not to, because I didn’t like the idea. If he INSISTED, I have a couple pieces that I would have recommended for him to be able to get tattooed. 

However, here’s the problem. The piece he got tattooed, was a piece of a personal character of mine. This character is what people would consider a “fursona” or “persona”. I use this character A LOT, but more specifically for vent art, when I’m having a difficult emotional time. 

The artist that did his tattoo, not only agreed to put my artwork on someone’s body without asking, but absolutely butchered my character as well. It looks….horrible. 

I’m upset because the character has a lot of meaning to me, and I don’t want a stranger I haven’t actually MET flaunting it around like it was some sort of tacky flash design.
