0,1ezeneg,AITA for refusing to get my hair cut?,"I (18f) am trans and in the process of growing out my hair. While my parents aren't against it, my dad says if I grow out my hair, he wants it to look good while I'm doing it and constantly tells me that it looks terrible and the ends are frayed, to take better care of it, etc. Yesterday I apparently unknowingly agreed to get it trimmed when he brought it up because I wasn't really paying attention to the conversation and saying yes to everything. They made an appointment for today, and when my mom told me I just flat out said that I didn't want to. My mom was disappointed and said that I was disregarding their wishes to make me look good, to which I said they were disregarding mine . Eventually, she let up and let me not go, but I kinda feel bad because the argument soured the mood. I honestly don't think my hair looks that bad and am tired of my parents telling me about it.

1,1ezd8bc,AITA for yelling at my SIL? ,"Me and my husband's family get along very well except my SIL because she always criticizes my taste and fashion and makes little comments about how my husband should divorce me, I always ignored her so I wouldn't cause a scene but this evening was the last straw for me, me and my husband have a trans daughter who we love very much, she just came out as trans a few weeks ago and made sure she knew we love her either way, we had a dinner with my husband's family and we told them because my daughter wanted to feel comfortable when talking to them, they all showed support except my SIL. 

At dinner it was all going good until my SIL started using my daughter's dead name and played dumb when me and my husband asked her to stop, she kept going until my daughter spoke up and told her to please stop because she felt uncomfortable with that name and my SIL replied with ""it's not my fault you decided to be a freak"" everyone went silent, and my daughter started crying and walked out the room, I am a very patient person but this was my breaking point because no one messes with my kid, I yelled at my SIL that she had no right to say that and that she had antagonized me enough so don't she dare start with my child she played the victim and started crying telling me I was inconsiderate but I didn't care and comforted my daughter and got her out of there. 

My husband's family has been blowing up my phone and calling me and an asshole and saying I shouldn't have said that, even my husband is telling me that what I said was inconsiderate and he had certain feelings about our daughter being trans, he is staying with his family and I'm starting to doubt myself.

2,1ez4vlk,AITAH for wanting an apology for not only taking my kid out to a birthday party without telling me but then embarrassing me in front of my roommates mother?,"So I 23f (trans if that matters) was sleeping before I had to go to work the next day, and my roommate and his mother took my baby out of her playpen and went to a birthday party. Now while I wouldn't have had a problem with this, I was never informed on the party at all. I only learned about it when I woke up and my roommate told me about it as I got dressed for work. I got on him a little about it telling him that he should have told me and that I'm not happy about the circumstances. He DID apologize initially but when his mom came in a little bit after (she gives me rides) he then began pushing at me to tell her the same right then and there, in a way a parent would to a misbehaving child. I like to keep things one on one and planned on talking to her when we got in the car so I was upset. (She ended up apologizing as well) On the car ride to work I messaged him letting him know that it was uncalled for what he did when his mother came over, which led to a couple days of gaslighting and insults. I tried again and again to try and resolve it in a civil manner but I kept getting met with ""feel how you want"" after every message and him trying every angle to turn the situation onto me. On the day we did end up resolving things was simply because he finally admitted (after calling me a self centered narcissist) that he was upset that I had told him the reason as to why he told me to tell his mother, as if it was his intention to be that way with me. I scrolled up to my first message and saw I had indeed messed up and wrote it as he said, and I admitted it to him, telling him that i had actually meant to just say that the way he went about it made me FEEL that was what he was doing. Now we are at a ""good"" place I guess but I can't help feeling like it only just went the way he wanted. With me just being dramatic or in the wrong or something, and I don't feel right about it.. so aitah?
