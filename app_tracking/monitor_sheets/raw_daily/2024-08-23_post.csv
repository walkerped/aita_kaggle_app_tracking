2,1ez4vlk,AITAH for wanting an apology for not only taking my kid out to a birthday party without telling me but then embarrassing me in front of my roommates mother?,"So I 23f (trans if that matters) was sleeping before I had to go to work the next day, and my roommate and his mother took my baby out of her playpen and went to a birthday party. Now while I wouldn't have had a problem with this, I was never informed on the party at all. I only learned about it when I woke up and my roommate told me about it as I got dressed for work. I got on him a little about it telling him that he should have told me and that I'm not happy about the circumstances. He DID apologize initially but when his mom came in a little bit after (she gives me rides) he then began pushing at me to tell her the same right then and there, in a way a parent would to a misbehaving child. I like to keep things one on one and planned on talking to her when we got in the car so I was upset. (She ended up apologizing as well) On the car ride to work I messaged him letting him know that it was uncalled for what he did when his mother came over, which led to a couple days of gaslighting and insults. I tried again and again to try and resolve it in a civil manner but I kept getting met with ""feel how you want"" after every message and him trying every angle to turn the situation onto me. On the day we did end up resolving things was simply because he finally admitted (after calling me a self centered narcissist) that he was upset that I had told him the reason as to why he told me to tell his mother, as if it was his intention to be that way with me. I scrolled up to my first message and saw I had indeed messed up and wrote it as he said, and I admitted it to him, telling him that i had actually meant to just say that the way he went about it made me FEEL that was what he was doing. Now we are at a ""good"" place I guess but I can't help feeling like it only just went the way he wanted. With me just being dramatic or in the wrong or something, and I don't feel right about it.. so aitah?

3,1ezreyi,AITA for calling my sister a snowflake?,"
I 31f have a friend who I consider to be mentally a little bit slow, but I appreciate the company and we enjoy each others time. I was on the phone to my sister telling her about the day I spent with my friend, and i mentioned he likes to go to a very immigrant heavy area to hang out. His type happens to be a certain ethnic minority which I also am a part of. 

I told her a funny story about when he went to the bathroom, he noticed a Middle Eastern man dressed as a terrorist there who was looking at him funny. He said he thought the man had Down syndrome or something like it because with middle easterners you can never tell. He also said some other weird things, such as I’m not like other people from my ethnic group etc. my sister reacted and said he was being racist and why am I friends with him. I told her that I enjoy his company and that he’s not racist, he just doesn’t understand what he’s saying, and if she would spend 1 hour with him she would see how he is and absolve him of his racism. She then said that there are people who are mentally disabled who are not racist and that saying that he doesn’t understand takes away accountability. To be clear, he isn’t diagnosed with anything, but through the time I’ve spent with him and with my background in the appropriate field I genuinely feel like he has some kind of diagnosis. 

I told her I dont understand why she needs to give her opinion when she doesn’t actually care, and that it makes me not want to share things with her. I also told her I’m not going to tell her what else he has said so as to not add fuel to the fire. 

For context I have extreme pms and am in that part of my cycle right now. She has mentioned before that when I and other family members have pms she’s usually the one to take the brunt of it. When she mentioned this I told her that it’s hard for me to relate, but that when it happens she should immediately call it out, and suggested that she use a count, for example “now you’ve done this once, twice, three times etc” 

I will admit that I got very defensive of my friend, but I admitted that while yes, he is racist, I truly believe he doesn’t understand what he’s saying. I raised my voice and got very riled up. At this point she asked me if I remember when I advised her to notify me when my pms is making me overreact and she started counting. This provoked me more and I told her that if this is what she means she feels like I take my pms out on her then she’s a snowflake and sick in the mind. She continued counting which was even more provocative. 
We ended the call but I told her while I do understand her side, that I didn’t conduct myself in the best way in the call, I don’t regret my reaction and don’t feel I owe her an apology for how I went about things.

4,1ezr3o4,AITA for telling my daughter she can't spend money on things that make her look older?,"I (50M) have a teenage daughter, Sophie ( just turned 14F), who recently got her ears pierced and now wants to add some lighter color (highlights) to her brownish hair.

I'm concerned that by letting her go ahead with this, she'll look older and might be perceived differently.

Beyond that, the cost of these changes is quite high. I’m worried that allowing her to spend money on things like this sends the wrong message about the value of money—my money—and how it should be used. I want her to understand the importance of budgeting and prioritizing her spending on things that are more essential or meaningful rather than just appearance.

I don't think a 14y old needs highlights.

I tried to explain my concerns to her, but she got upset, saying that I’m overreacting and that it’s just hair. Now I’m wondering if I’m being too strict or controlling.

5,1ezqx0i,AITA for telling my sister she can't have alcohol?,"Over the past year or so, my sister (45F) has had a bit of an obsession with hard seltzers. To others, this may not be a problem, but she's a diabetic and is what we would call ""non-compliant."" Even if those seltzers only have a gram of sugar in them, she's the type to drink 5 or 6 in a sitting- almost every weekend. Almost without fail, every two weeks on payday, she comes back home with 2 to 4 CASES of the seltzers and I (22F) shake my head at her every time. 

Because of her drinking habits and diabetes, I've had to rush her to the emergency room a few times because her sugar was extremely high. There was one night she came to my room to ask if I would take her to the ER (of course, I would) at TWO IN THE MORNING. Mind you, she didn't really have these problems when she wasn't drinking. 

When I told her and the rest of our family that her blood sugar problems are most likely because of how many of those things she has, they'd tell me that it's fine, she's an adult. Or, my other sister (43 F), would say that she was way worse when they were in their 20s. 

Like drink all night, drink beer in the morning to sober up worse. 

But I'm 22, so I never saw that side of her, and she didn't have her diabetes then (a result of a medication). And since she started drinking again, I've had to take her to the hospital at least 3 times, not including the times she asked our other sister to take her. 

Around the later half of last year, I put my foot down and told her that, if I was taking her to the store, she won't be getting alcohol and putting it in my car.

Saying that she's not as bad as she was, and that I wasn't there to experience it. But that's the issue, I WASNT there to experience it, and the issues I see now are concerning.

Everytime she asks me to go to the grocery store or the gas station, I tell her ""yeah, but you won't be putting alcohol in my car,"" and she gets an attitude with me everytime and either goes to tattle on me to either our dad or sister.

6,1ezqwri,AITA for having told my brotherI don't want to hear him insulting me again?,"Hii

I’m (f19) totally emotional right now over a fight with my brother (13). It sounds so stupid writing it, but it really just got to me. 

I had such an awesome relationship with him when he was a little younger.

And then he entered puberty. And he changed so dang much. Like so, so much. He started being incredibly self entitled. Like a lot. Claiming he knows everything better. Throwing tantrums when he didn’t get to eat another snack at 1 a.m. Then he started insulting everyone, just like that. Started with my younger brother (9). Calling him dumb. Telling him to eat less, calling him fat. Stupid. I started to step in from time to time, because it really did affect the other. Though pulled away sometimes cuz I didn’t want to ruin my relationship with him. 

Lately though, like over three months, he turned to me, too. Started saying I had “dumb shit minus IQ” or something like that. Calling me a poor blighter. Turning to me being fat. To saying I’m complicated for not liking his dark humour. That I am super sensitive. Saying I don’t know what to do with my life. He is very invested in krypto coins, in investing etc , always telling me I am doing it the wrong way, saying he’ll surpass me while I’ll stay poor my whole life, and things like that. And that really frequent, and in a really mean tone. And where I really lose it, is when he says he knows how I really am. That he has heard FACTS about me. He was referring to huge quarrels with my father I had after finishing school.

I never said anything to my brother. Just things like “mmh, of course” or what we say here like “same for you”. Never something serious. 

And he did it again today. My laptop was in his room (which is the living room at day, complicated story), he already asks me to get it out in that commanding tone and brings up the thing with him knowing facts about me. I went to the kitchen, took deep breathes to not overreact, Made myself a tea and thought about telling him how I feel about it. I did: “ Look, I am telling you this, and you do what you want to do about it. I don’t want you ever say these things to me again (dumb shit Iq etc). If you have some kind of problem with me, or feel like I am the asshole for something, tell me. I don’t want you doing this again. We are going to the  movies in three days and I don’t want to carry this with us, I am walking on eggshells to not destroy our relationship but I can’t to this anymore. Really, if you do that again, you have lost me. And I am not menacing you, but that is how I feel.” 

He said (looking at his phone) “ mhm, mhm, are you done?” (Again, insolent tone). “I see you are kinda upset, so I am not saying anything back” I was like “No, don’t decide that for me, tell me”

He went back to “nono, I want sleep, are you done” etc. I took my things , turned off the lights and walked away. And he was like “ I didn’t tell you to turn the lights off”. I ignored it. And guess what came?

7,1ezqs9b,AITA changing my personality?,"I (17f) am and have always been a quiet antisocial person (I have depression and social anxiety). I avoid groups of people like they could be the death of me and I don't even talk that often, even when I'm with my family. When at family gatherings I'm always alone in a corner and being dead silent while my family is being loud and friendly because that's the way they all are. I'm like the odd one out, not the black sheep but more of the gray one. I'm not mistreated or anything, I love them dearly- I'm just more so ignored which is my fault I'll be real. I don't voice my feelings and I don't even talk about interests, only school-related things such as grades and classes I find interesting or rough. I should try and tell them more about myself because they still get me stuff that I was interested in when I was a LOT younger (13/14) for my birthday/ Christmas lol.
Anyhow, I'm quiet. Except for when I'm with my group of friends when I'm with them I'm an extrovert. Constantly yelling and joking around with them- I don't know why I just feel lighter and less heavy when I'm with them. I truly laugh my ugly laugh. But one day I was with them all at our hangout spot which is a McDonald's funny enough, I was being a loud funny friend, teasing Jenna and giggling a LOT, I didn't even realize when a family friend walked in. I live in a small town so word got around quickly that the silent kid who rarely talks was being the loudest person in Mcdonald's- help that sounds so funny..anyway, this grew HUGE everyone in town was questioning me if I liked them because I was silent around them as I am around everyone.

I (17f) am and have always been a quiet antisocial person (I have depression and social anxiety). I avoid groups of people like they could be the death of me and I don't even talk that often, even when I'm with my family. When at family gatherings I'm always alone in a corner and being dead silent while my family is being loud and friendly because that's the way they all are. I'm like the odd one out, not the black sheep but more of the gray one. I'm not mistreated or anything, I love them dearly- I'm just more so ignored which is my fault I'll be real. I don't voice my feelings and I don't even talk about interests, only school-related things such as grades and classes I find interesting or rough. I should try and tell them more about myself because they still get me stuff that I was interested in when I was a LOT younger (13/14) for my birthday/ Christmas lol.
Anyhow, I'm quiet. Except for when I'm with my group of friends when I'm with them I'm an extrovert. Constantly yelling and joking around with them- I don't know why I just feel lighter and less heavy when I'm with them. I truly laugh my ugly laugh. But one day I was with them all at our hangout spot which is a McDonald's funny enough, I was being a loud funny friend, teasing Jenna and giggling a LOT, I didn't even realize when a family friend walked in. I live in a small town so word got around quickly that the silent kid who rarely talks was being the loudest person in Mcdonald's- help that sounds so funny..anyway, this grew HUGE everyone in town was questioning me if I liked them because I was silent around them as I am around everyone.

8,1ezqqvy,AITAH for suggesting earplugs to a couple with a colicky child?,"This happened a couple of months ago. My wife and I were at a party where we met a couple who had their 1 year old with them. During the party the child had a meltdown and screamed the place down. Its volume and stamina was incredible and it kept up a devastating din for nearly 15 minutes before it calmed down and went to sleep. The parents were obviously mortified. Nobody said anything and the party continued. 

A while later the party wound down and we were all saying our goodbyes. I found myself with the couple and they apologized to me for their child's behavior. I put them at their ease, and suggested that they get earplugs to wear during future episodes, as the noise is terrible for their ears and also it will help them keep their cool.

I should mention that my wife and I used earplugs when our kids were young... they did their share of screaming and without earplugs at the ready I would have gone stark staring mad. My wife was initially skeptical but she ultimately ended up using them as well. 

Anyway... the couple appeared to be somewhat nonplussed by my remark, but did not say anything and we parted shortly after. Later that night, our hostess received a lengthy message from the mother, who accused me of insensitivity and rudeness. The hostess (who has known us for decades) forwarded the message to my wife, and now they are both pissed off at me. 

I reminded her that we ourselves used earplugs with our kids, and how much they helped us. She said that that was completely different.

9,1ezq75g,AITA for the way I acted with my friend?,"I 21M (who lives with my parents and my Younger brother) have been chatting online and spending time together with my friend 19M (who lives with his mom and younger brother)for the last 6 or 7 years. He is an introvert wich is diagnosed with ADHD

His dad married to get out of his parents house and later showed up as homosexual. Leaving his wife (my friend's mom) behind, but at least provided money for her needs It's no surprise that, that, he needs some medicine to feel well.

Almost since the beginning of our friendship he had some type of.
territorial personality around me. Sometimes when I'm with friends he really tend to salty with me and even my friends, which majority of time, I'm presenting them to him, trying to help them become friends too, since the lack of friends he has, is part of what is making he feel so territorial around me ""his most long friendship that hadn't drifted away""

After about 1½ year of our friendship, their parents decided to move to London as a way to try and live together again. With no choice he moved to London with his parents and brother, and tried to start a new life there, Wich I was happy for him, but he was still struggling with making new friends, since everyone there according to him ""didn't caugh his interest""

He started to develop some romantic interest on me. But I was aways sincere to him, saying I don't feel the same, and that he should really save that feeling for someone else. I didn't want to lie to him

Unfortunately for both of us, I had developed some romantic interest for other people and did end up on some relationships in the meantime. And like everyone, a lot of them didn't last long.

That wasn't much a problem since the end of last year, when his mother said I could try and go travel to London to try and get a better life myself. They were offering to help me to get a start.

I accepted the offer and since at the time i was working at the military. It was easy to save money. Not much time after. he told me he was thinking about marrying me on paper, so i could get a permit to stay legally, since he's already a legal citizen. I agreed, and even tho wasn't a romantic marriage, that didn't stopped him to try and search for some rings we could use together. Resulting on the same talk I had with him before.

Sometimes i have doubts and even panick about that idea of everything going wrong and he's aways there to confort me, Wich i am grateful for

3 days ago he told me that he heard his father saying he's a headache and a hole on the wallet with all his meds necessities. And I told him that if his dad thinks that, that's his father's fault. Because his father left him when he was little and now had to deal with it.

But I think it backfired because my friend felt sad because I didn't deny it. And now he's giving me the cold shoulder. He still talk to our friends in common, but not with me.

10,1ezq2su,AITA for saying my daughter should go to a school closer to me?,"Is it weird to want to know where your daughter is? Especially if the Mother F35 is out of the country?

TLDR: My ex is a Flight Attendant/Cabin Crew, but her being away with majority custody is somehow better than me being able to actually have full custody if my daughter was in a school closer to me.

I do not know where or who my daughter is with when her mother is away, and she won't tell me because our custody agreement is based on her basically never being away, which doesn't match her job description. I was dumb to have conceded that in the first place I will admit. 

I have tried to facilitate having my daughter F4 more, I have changed my job to become a remote worker, with pretty flexible hours, I am in a stable relationship with 2 Step Children, and all I ask is to keep me informed on my daughters where abouts when my ex isn't in the country.

We have had plenty of tiffs over this matter and I feel like I am insane. Most of my friends don't even have children at my age, let alone grasping the feeling of not knowing who is caring for their child at any given time. This hasn't stopped my ex from reducing the frequency I have my daughter, nor has she stopped giving me information about major decisions involving our daughter until its too late for me to really think things through.

My daughter is now moving school for the 2nd time on short notice, and although I preliminarily thought it might work it has ended up being a worst location for me to get to so I can't take on any extra responsibility and what will proceed is a further reduction in my time.

The last time she moved my daughter, the mother applied under her last name and I had to correct the school and submit my daughters passport to prove that the name was not correct which was followed by accusations of me being a narcissist by controlling the situation.

The latest was a statement, as you are aware I have bought a house and our daughter needs to move school, the meeting is in a few days can you make it? My answer being no, because I didn't have ample time to arrange with my new job.

A few months ago she asked of she could take our daughter to France this week, I said of course. On Monday she said could I have a consent form for Turkey. How can you not mention that the holiday was not France but Turkey?

I'm essentially cut out of every decision and when I don't agree I am curtailed into agreeing as to not go against the status quo that dads don't really have a decision in their child's well being, and just merely need to be informed when it's deemed convenient by our daughters mum.

When I disagree all the key words of blackmail, gaslighting and control appear, yet it has never dawned on my ex to involve me in the process from the inception of a decision where I believe I would be quite a fair conversationalist.

So she is away a lot, and I can literally look after my daughter full time, including school runs. The only caveat being the school would have to be closer to me. But instead I am in a situation where I see my daughter at the weekends, she complains when her mum is vacant, and I do not even want to mention how the conversations go should I ever address this.

I have been told plain and simply, she is the mum and she knows what is best and I can see my daughter at the weekends. Or if she is travelling.

But I can't, because I can not get her to a school so far from me and pick her up, and cover my workload.

Not to mention we have it down to a Tee in our household with my step children's school runs.

My ex does get a lot of downtime where she is home, not working for extended periods of time. But the she is away. Just plain and simple not there, away. Where is my daughter during these times?

I would never stop my ex from seeing our daughter, but I am beginning to believe that trying to our her in a school near me and having primary responsibility whilst my ex is away is a bad idea, because of my existence persistence that a child should never be away from their mother. But yet she leaves our daughter all the time.

I am at the end of my string to put it lightly, I can't carry on with this battle but I know her plan has been to wither me down all along.

I don't want to put our daughter through court, and mediation is literally a joke. She hasn't stuck to the agreement we have now so how is it going to help the next time.

We are planning on re entering mediation but I am not hopeful.

I am just looking for any advice I can get, I just would like my daughter to have a stable life with a family that loves her, and I say that including her mum. Not a life where she sees me on weekends and sees her mum when she isn't working.

It could be she sees me when her mum is working and sees her mum when she isn't working, I just can't seem to get this through to my ex..

I found myself a bit creeped out by this. Sure, mother knows best, but it often feels like she controls a bit too much of my life. It gets to points where she’ll open the door while I say I’m changing, where she says it’s okay just because she’s a woman (“I gave birth to you, so stop being squeamish about it!”).

14,1ezpja3,WIBTA for removing the deadbolt since my partner keeps locking me out?,"My gf knows I don’t have a key for the deadbolt but still everyday locks not only the patio door that has cameras all over it that we usually leave unlocked but she also deadbolts the front door so I have to knock or yell until the dogs get going and then hope she hears me over the dogs (or call her)

I usually give about a n hours notice to when I’ll get home and still just about everyday I end up locked out. 

I always get annoyed telling her we have two big ass dogs and cameras for a reason there is no need to lock the doors; and even if she does feel unsafe at MINIMUM don’t lock the dead bolt and still she does every SINGLE day.  

I “threatened” that if it happens again I’ll just remove the deadbolt because I should be able to get into my own house without so much annoyance after 10-14 hour work days.

15,1ezp7qe,AITA for telling my (F21) friend (F21) to stop stealing from the corner store in our neighborhood?,"
I recently discovered my friend has been stealing from the local corner store. I found out when I saw a photo of camera footage of her posted on the front door. I talked to the store owner about it, but I didn’t tell him I knew her. He seemed very stressed about the situation and mentioned he’s been struggling financially. I took a photo of the front door to confront my friend.

When I asked her about it, she thought it was funny, like a trophy. I asked if she was stupid, and she said it wasn’t that serious. I was shocked by how little she cared and ended up laughing in disbelief. I didn’t mean to, but I think my laughing egged her on, so she started talking shit about the store owner and defending her actions. She joked about how he needs to watch out before she pulls up on him again, what was he expecting when he opened his shop in the hood, how “Chinese” (the owners are Vietnamese) business owners exploit black neighborhoods, so she feels justified in stealing, and how Asians are anti-black, so she doesn’t think what she’s doing is wrong.

I asked how the owner was anti-black, and she said because he always watches her, assuming she’ll steal. I was dumbfounded by her stupidity. I pointed out how she regularly does steal, so of course, he’s suspicious. She laughed it off, and I called her a dumbass and told her to stop before I report her. She got mad and called me a coon. I told her again to stop stealing since they’re struggling, but she refused and argued that Asian shop owners exploit black communities. I sarcastically commented that Asian immigrants don’t come to America just to exploit black people, but some are poor and can only afford to live in low-income neighborhoods. She called me a coon again, brought up the rooftop Koreans, the murder of Latasha Harlins, and I told her that the store owner has no connection to those events, has never murdered anyone, and is just trying to survive like the rest of us.

She wouldn’t listen and started cussing me out. I called her out for not being able to buy a $3 bag of chips and said if she needs it, I’ll buy it for her. After this, I left and told her to stop stealing. She’s stopped talking to me for a few days and began subtweeting about how she’ll never understand “black people defending non-blacks,” referring to me. I saw her Instagram story with a photo of the footage taped onto the store’s front door with laughing emojis under it.

I don’t think I’m the asshole, but this is affecting our friendship. Should I have approached this differently? AITA? Thanks to anyone who responds!

16,1ezp3lh,AITA: belated birthday celebration,"I (M29) recently celebrated my birthday over the weekend. Unfortunately, one of my close friends was unable to attend and asked if we could do something at a later date to make up for missing it. I of course agreed because the only thing I really wanted to do was spend time with friends and family.
I also work with my friend; we both work in food service. Occasionally staff from other restaurants will come in to get food and will leave coupons. The next time we worked together, she had bought me a birthday cake and gave it to me during our shift.
Later on, a server from Twin Peaks dropped off three different coupons at my store. My friend then asked if I would be willing to go to Twin Peaks after we closed at work with another close friend of ours to eat, have drinks and cut my cake. I considered it to be a good idea but I texted my girlfriend (F23) to be sure since I would be coming home later than usual. My girlfriend started becoming a bit passive aggressive about it but stated it was fine if I went so I did.
My friends and I were each able to use a coupon to cut the cost of each of our orders and enjoyed the birthday cake. I spent approximately an hour and a half there and had fun just spending time with my friends. When I got home, my girlfriend revealed that she was upset with me for going and that it was disrespectful to her that I was even there because of the type of atmosphere the establishment embodies.

My mother questioned this and asked my brother to ask the groom to add me to the list. My brother is one of the groomsmen, so his request was immediately approved and I was added to the guest list. I want to note that I was not intentionally excluded. I am over a decade younger than both the groom and my brother, so the groom simply didn't think to include me as we are not close (and have basically never spoken in my entire life). I also want to note that neither my brother nor my mother thought to ask me whether or not I even wanted to attend this wedding before having me added to the guest list. If they had, I would have refused then.

I strongly dislike large-scale events and avoid attending them at all costs, and my family knows this. My mother and I have had many arguments about attending this wedding, and I have brought this up to her every single time. During these arguments, she has acknowledged that she knew I would have said no had she asked me, but she still had my brother include me because she wanted me there. I believe my brother also knows I would have said no, but we don't talk often, so I don't have verbal confirmation of this.

My mother asked me every day to just relent and attend this wedding because it would look bad if there was an empty seat after they specifically asked for one for me. She's even cried, telling me she knows she messed up by including me and she'll never do this again if I could just do her a favor this one time. To be honest, I could've gone to the wedding, but I am just a really stubborn person and I don't feel like traveling for it.

The only thing that would've changed had I gone to the wedding is that my mother would be less embarrassed.

My mother and I disagree on a lot of things, so arguments aren't uncommon in our house, but she is really upset at me for not attending the wedding.

For some background context my sister's boyfriend is not poor at all and he doesn't struggle with money (he makes over 300K a year for sure.)

My sister's boyfriend told me before dinner that he wanted to propose that night and I wished him good luck. I was really excited to see my sister's reaction and to prepare for her engagement day. During dinner everything was going smoothly, we were having fun and having a calm conversation. I see my sister's boyfriend starting a romantic speech so I'm thinking this is were he's going to do it , he gets on his knees , he pulls out the ring and proposes to her. My sister gets teary and she says I do of course, but then I noticed the ring was made of plastic, it was a toy ring.

I asked him what was up with the ring and he told me he was going to get a real soon, because he wanted a specific one and was saving the money for it. I brushed it off and was like makes sense but then my sister started talking about her dream wedding, that it was going to be big and fancy. Her boyfriend cut her off and joked that big and fancy weddings cost and that it would be better to do a close themed wedding inviting only close family. They also talked about the wedding dress and I told my sister we could go shopping anytime she wanted. Her boyfriend suggested that she should wear our mom's old wedding dress and that it would be really touching. I thought that was boring but it wasn't my wedding, as long as my sister was fine with it I was too.

This is where it was getting ridiculous, my mom and dad were congratulating them and my dad brings up the honeymoon phase and wondered where they were thinking of doing it.

Our relationship has been amazing, ofc we had our downs and ups but we always sort it out. He gets along with all my family and has met everyone (expect my dad,he left when I was 3) but yeah, he really enjoys being with my family and my mom invited him everywhere,concert,vacations and its been amazing. And well there is Alexs family..I have only met his step mom and dad (his mother left too). And his dad is not really amazing or treats him good as far as I know and what he has told me about him. He seems really horrible and not a good father to my boyfriend. His dad  invited me to dinner with his step mom and I did not really wanna come because I do not get along with his dad but I wanted to come because he asked.


But before I went to dinner with his family, Alex told me that his dad does not like me at all, and said to alex that He doesnt know why He is with me. Because aprently im not pretty or smth like that, and he is dating a broke girl. His dad wanted him to date a rich girl because He wanted that his son could take money from me( tho im not even broke, I live a comfortable life,have food and everything I wanted). When he said that I felt hurt, I did everything I could so his dad would like me.
So when we met to dinner, I acted cold and kinda rude a bit, but I did say thank you and thanked him for inviting me but thats it. But when i got home, I GOT lecture for being disrespectful. His dad called my mom and said I was rude,cold and did not thank him for dinner even tho I did!!

Now my mom told everyone I was disrespectful to my boyfriends father? Now they are kinda mad at me and told me I should of been respectful atleast( I did told them what his dad thinks of me..)
So here I am asking AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-23,"AITA for refusing to respect my bf dad? Hello everyone! I decide to make this account just to see if I am the AITA or not. So my bf(we will call alex) had been dating for almost 2years. Our relationship has been amazing, ofc we had our downs and ups but we always sort it out. He gets along with all my family and has met everyone (expect my dad,he left when I was 3) but yeah, he really enjoys being with my family and my mom invited him everywhere,concert,vacations and its been amazing. And well there is Alexs family..I have only met his step mom and dad (his mother left too). And his dad is not really amazing or treats him good as far as I know and what he has told me about him. He seems really horrible and not a good father to my boyfriend. His dad  invited me to dinner with his step mom and I did not really wanna come because I do not get along with his dad but I wanted to come because he asked.


But before I went to dinner with his family, Alex told me that his dad does not like me at all, and said to alex that He doesnt know why He is with me. Because aprently im not pretty or smth like that, and he is dating a broke girl. His dad wanted him to date a rich girl because He wanted that his son could take money from me( tho im not even broke, I live a comfortable life,have food and everything I wanted).

23,1ezo8t4,AITA for babying my singing partner because she was new and nervous?,"Hi! I (16f) have a singing partner (16f), and we are partnered up with another duo (both 16m). Let’s call my partner Katy, and the duo Allen and Tom. So Katy is really new to singing, and I mean new. She’s incredibly talented though, and loves it a lot. Allen seems a little wary of Katy, but is warming up to her, and Tom has RBF so I can’t tell off his expression alone, but I think he likes her?
Anyways, off topic. We decided to apply for a competitive venue, and we got in. My whole team has been practicing like crazy, so I felt we were prepared for the event. Before all of our events, we all have our individual ways to get ourselves ready. Allen shakes his hands and bounces on his feet, Tom closes his eyes and thinks, and I do the choreography but smaller. But Katy worries me, because she clams up and looks like she’s seen a ghost. 
She then proceeded to yell that she wanted to sing before we went on stage. I think the large crowds are still scary to her. Anyways, we started singing and I got the crowd really hype because I was working them. But I got really far away from Katy, and she missed her cue, but I refused to let her fall, so I ran back to her and tried to back up her part, but without me leading the chorus, it fell apart more, and sounded terrible. My dad was in the crowd and said so as well afterwards. 
The crowd got quieter and it was really awkward when we walked off. 
I told Katy I would back her up when she faltered, and she just looked kind of glum. We all started blaming ourselves except for Allen, who has a HUGE EGO and told us we should just make it better next time. Katy started to blame herself and I told her not to, and she ran away to go get drinks from a vending machine so she could breathe. 
I felt bad and turned to Allen and told him I should have protected Katy better, and Allen was incredibly confused, and the two brain cells in his mind rubbed together to form a thought. 
He accused me of babying my partner and not treating her as part of the team, but treating her like she won’t be able to be good enough for the team unless I helped her. He then called me an asshole. I was stunned and just stood there, slack-jawed, and he accused me of seeing her as a “helpless dependent” in my eyes. Tom was standing there the whole time and had no expression change that I noticed. 
Katy came back then, and commented that I looked dazed, but everyone was called back on stage and we lost, as expected. 
Katy left the venue crying, and I almost started crying, and then walked home and slept the rest of the day away. I thought about what Allen said all day, and it made me think about how I don’t think I see Katy as a real member of the team. 
So, Am I the Asshole for babying my partner because she’s new to this to make her comfortable, but ultimately bringing her down because I don’t see her as an equal to me?",Asshole,2024-08-23,"AITA for babying my singing partner because she was new and nervous?

24,1ezo8qu,AITA For Making My Bandmates and Myself Cry In One Heated Session?,"
So for some backstory, I (17F) formed a band to make good music and accomplish a variety of many legendary things. There were some tensions because I am admittedly strict, but I want us to be as efficient as possible. I think that we were all caught off guard when this incident had happened today. The band members are kind of starting to become friends, which may not be a bad thing. I, personally was close friends with out bassist (17F) for our whole lives. However, during an important practice after getting a poor audience & critical reaction at a big event’s show, I felt that we had to become more serious. Friendship conversations were still happening and I thought that it would fix our band to get back on the track. Basically, I told our band’s drummer (15F), let us call her “Demon” (she has an affinity for demons, I am not being rude) that she was fooling around and was not worthy for making good music. I do not actually hate her, but I want all of us to succeed. I hate to have emotions in my band, so I tend to be blunt. This made her run out crying. I understand that she is younger and I may have been too hard on her. She wants to be like her older sister (16F), who also plays the drums for another band, which our band is kind of in a rivalry with.

Then, Demon’s best friend/our band’s keyboardist (17F), let us call her “Witch,” not to be mean, she dresses as a witch in an RPG Role-Playing-Game that she likes. started crying and scolded me for it. This is unusual because she is shy, so this must be the real deal. I feel bad. I began to feel bad and I ran out. Leaving our two other band members, the bassist (17F) and the guitarist, (16F) to just awkwardly stand there. I feel bad for our bassist, she is so sweet. This is embarrassing. I began to cry when I was going to go home. I hate to say this, and this is incredibly embarrassing, but I feel like I am in the darkness and that I am feeling loneliness. This emotion is a new aspect. I hope I told both sides of the story well enough. Am I the asshole for this. I would like to fix the band and understand ourselves, so advice is needed, either way. Sorry if this is scrambled too. I am seeing a band at a concert right now because a girl that I know (16F) invited me to her concert. I hope that I will get some inspiration.",Asshole,2024-08-23,"AITA For Making My Bandmates and Myself Cry In One Heated Session?

25,1ezo2ng,AITA for declining an invite to my partners cousins wedding after not being invited initially ,"Ive (F34) been with my partner for 8 years, and have been welcomed into his family during this time. We have chosen not to get married or have children at this stage for various reasons, but we may in the future.

Last year my partner received a save the date for his cousins wedding. As I had attended other weddings in the family we assumed I would be invited. With the wedding less than 6 months away we had plans in place to take time off work to travel to attend the wedding which is midweek.

My partner had since received a phone call from his cousin outlining that I'm not invited to the wedding due to size restrictions of the venue, but I may be able to come if someone isn't able to. Some of his other cousins also will not have partners attending, with the distinction being that unmarried partners were not invited. 

My almost sister in law will not be attending as she is travelling at the time, and now I've since been invited to take her place. 

AITA for being upset that I was not invited to this wedding initially and therefor not wanting to go as a step in guest?

My husband has an annoying habit of trolling people around him, it’s a mild annoyance for most of us adults, but it can be pretty harmful for children.

Lyra is currently having a phase when she constantly asks us whom do we love more, and I always tell her that I love them both equally.

My husband however was asked this question at the dinner table and he said “of course I love Kyra more, she doesn’t ask stupid questions”. Lyra started crying and he added “just kidding, I can’t even tell the difference between you two”. Obviously it made them both cry.

My girls were upset and I saw red, I looked at him and reprimanded him harshly, saying that it’s no way to talk to children. He said that it’s no way to talk to their father either, giving him a stern talk in front of kids, and also said that he’s “preparing them for the outside world”.

I can be an asshole because we had an agreement that we would never have arguments in front of children and this thing escalated into an argument.

27,1ezni0o,AITA for not telling my work partner I'm leaving,"First time ever posting.

Some exposition, I(m19) got a job at a doggy daycare about 3 months ago by sheer luck and not much prior experience. the staff here is all girls except me and I have no problem with that. We are small so This job requires two people per shift for the dogs, so I have a work partner(WP), we split the work half way so it's fair. All of my coworkers are experienced and are fast at their jobs unlike me. i and most of my coworkers expect this but on my first month here one of my coworkers(B) flipped out on me for not keeping up and asking about checkins for the next day. since then she has said nearly nothing to me untill last week when I told my boss about how her ignoring me is preventing me from doing my job. (we need to talk when we switch out shifts) this has annoyed me somewhat but still I have no beef with anyone.

Now my situation. I found out a couple days ago I'm getting laid off at the end of this week, a combination of my coworkers and WP coming to my boss with small nitpicking, this month being the slowest out of the year and my boss needing someone to be laid off or cutting hours. 

Me and my boss have not and do not plan to tell anyone until im gone I don't want anyone treating me any diffrent just because I'm leaving and I really don't want the half-assed sorry's and the people asking how im doing. Also a part of me wants the realization, that instead of coming and talking to me respectfully, them constantly complaining to the boss about small details has resulted in them having to do more work, for it to be a suprise. 

 I have given nothing but respect to them and still do. I have 3 days left and idk if I should tell my WP.

BTW my boss has been nothing but helpful through this she is actively helping me find another daycare to go to if I so please to. she also gave me an extra 
Week to get more hours before I go and has been checking in on me about this all.

I have stayed in very good terms with B, and we stayed good friends, and both went one to have several relationships.


Well, B had the occasion recently to take some vacation, and decided to visit my boyfriend a while ago. A lot happened since he booked his tickets, including me and my boyfriend getting together. Hence B didn't know I was going to be there, and we both thought it would be a nice surprise; since we hadn't seen each other in a while, and he was very happy to learn we had gotten together.

Only, things didn't turn out as expected. B informed us that he started dating a girl a few months ago, who happens to be very insecure and possessive (required him to stay constantly in touch to the point where she calls him for 30mn several times a day, gets mad when he doesn't have network, has breakdowns if he goes to the beach and sees other women in swimsuits...). And turns out; she hates that B stayed good friends with me, and another one of his exes. She simply can't tolerate it, can spend hours crying because of it.

B was confronted with telling her about my presence and having her absolutely break down, saying he would have no choice but to go back immediately to his place; or not mentioning I was there. He ended up deciding not to mention I was there.

Today, we went on a hike all together; and enjoyed a wonderful sunset in the mountains. My boyfriend took a really cute picture of the sunset, with both our feet next to each other in the front, and shared it on Instagram. However, B got worried that his girlfriend would stalk my bf on Instagram, see a picture with women's feet, and break down. Hence, he asked my bf if he could instead share the picture to close relatives instead.

Both me and my bf disagreed, thinking it's a bit paranoid; and disliking the idea that we have to hide our relationship because of B's girlfriend, whose behavior we find very toxic. Yet, I am thinking that maybe we are wrong here, it wouldn't cost much to just share it with close relatives, and it could avoid B a lot of trouble.

31,1ezmkf1,AITA for bathing a cat covered in piss by taking it in the pool instead of the bathtub?,"The background - my wife (31F) and I (32M) have a cat with the unfortunate problem that it pees when it gets startled - like, a \*\*LOT\*\* of piss. 

The other day, the cat was hanging out in the garage underneath the car, and it got startled by the garage door opening. It let go with absolute \*buckets\* of piss, then crawled through the piss, then crawled across the filthy garage floor underneath the car, leaving about an 8-inch wide streak of smeared dirt and piss on the floor, then ran outside.

I finally caught up to the cat in the yard and picked it up, and its entire underside, chest and belly, even its neck and front legs were \*SOAKED\* with piss that's dripping everywhere. I mean its whole body was just covered in piss. The fur on its underside was black with garage filth mixed with the piss. I was getting piss all over myself just trying to hold the cat at arm's length.

Then my wife comes out and says she'll start a bath. I tell her no way am I bringing the cat through the house like this. The swimming pool is right there, and since I'm covered in piss too, I step in (fully clothed) and bring the cat with me. The cat is just sort of resigned to the whole thing and sits there, then after a little bit it starts squirming, so I let go and it climbs out. 

My wife is upset, of course, asking what I was thinking putting a cat in the pool. I tell her how is it any different from putting the cat in the tub, its whole body is going to get wet either way. The cat honestly did not seem to mind it any more than a normal bath, and it had the added benefit of not getting cat piss all over the house. 

She still thinks I was all fucked up for doing this, but I'm like look, it's not as if I'm just torturing the cat for fun, sometimes you just kind of have to do what you need to do.

32,1ezmac3,AITA for changing the pronunciation of my last name?,"I (35F) have a non-standard last name for my country (think lots of consonants in repetition). People around me almost always have a hard time pronouncing it, and I work in a field where last names are the norm (Mrs., Dr., Captain, etc). So when I started in this field in my late teens/early 20s, I changed the pronunciation from the way my dad and mom pronounced it, to closer to the original pronunciation in the original language. I like how it sounds, and at work, it’s actually easier to explain the pronunciation in a way that people remember it (and I’ve also gotten some cute nicknames from it).

The issue is: my mom (late 50s) refuses to use the “new” pronunciation, which I’ve been using for 16 years. It ticks me off because my mom and biological father were only married a couple of years in the early 90s; I don’t have a relationship with my biological father or his side of the family (a whole other set of issues). I kept my biological last name and my mom changed her last name when she remarried in the late 90s. So it’s not her last name anymore and hasn’t been for 25+ years. 

My thought process is: this is MY name. It’s not common and I’ve never met anyone else with my name who I wasn’t already related to. I was told the correct linguistic pronunciation by someone from the name’s origin country, and I liked it so I changed it. My mom, however, refuses to use the new pronunciation because it “used to be” her name, too. And because of that, no one in my family will use it either. It’s honestly not a huge deal that my broader family doesn’t use it because I don’t see them often, but my mom and stepdad run in the same professional circles I do and STILL refuse to use my preferred pronunciation, even though it’s not their name. 

It came to a head recently when my mom was introducing me to someone and used my title, first name, and incorrect last name pronunciation. I very quickly used the pronunciation I use (with the little verbal device I always follow up with to help with pronunciation) and shook their hand. My mom pulled me aside afterwards and said I’d embarrassed her by insinuating that she doesn’t know how to pronounce her own kids name, and I reiterated that I changed the pronunciation years ago and this is how I’m now known professionally. She got offended and reminded me that it had been her name once, too. I just sort of shrugged my shoulders and moved on, but it really bothered me.

My husband (whose last name I didn’t take) said I have a right to pronounce my name however I want, and that I have a right to insist on the correct pronunciation. My stepdad says it’s not fair to ask my mom to change “after all these years” (even though I’ve now used my preferred pronunciation longer than my mother ever shared the name).

33,1ezm5va,AITA for refusing to participate in a walking excursion although I said I wasn’t doing it in the first place ,"Disclaimer: ENGLISH IS NOT MY FIRST LANGUAGE 

I (16F) my sister (15F) and my roommates (18F,17F,17F,15M,14M and 12F) are currently on vacation with our “caretakers” (55M,53F,57F and 30F). We’re on vacation at the seaside, like every year, but since a trip that we made 3 years ago, which consisted in walking from mountain to mountain for 6 days straight( we were at 5 terre,Liguria). After that vacation, we vehemently said “no more walking” in future vacations and the “caretakers” agreed especially the ones who had some physical disabilities and had remained as such till this summer, when we were discussing the vacation destination and we decided the same as the year before. However, the “caretakers” boss, who is also the summer vacation organiser, scheduled walking excursion for 3/4 days and implied that it was mandatory. At first, we were like “ no, we are not walking, we told beforehand we weren’t walking again after 5 terre” but he kept brushing us off and straight up ignoring the topic and even  tried to convince us by saying “the excursion will be simple and blah blah” total bullshit because the last time he said that must of us couldn’t make till the end and he didn’t even appear to care. Fast forward to today, fifth day of vacation for us, and third for the boss, we were still saying we won’t be doing the excursion but he blew on us and said “ you guys literally fo nothing all day but go to the beach and don’t take a swim so the least you could fo is participate in the excursion”. I must admit some of us spend all day minding our business but that doesn’t mean we don’t go to the beach  or swimming pool. He then said he didn’t spend 6000€ for nothing and it’s the bare minimum. The problem came afterwards when  the others tried  convincing us not because they geniale cared but because they wanted to go and if we don’t go they can’t go + if we don’t go the boss will have an anger attack. We considered going to keep the peace but the boss went his way to call us basically dumb in different ways, people who don’t want to fucking live and we don’t deserve to be here. After this we said “ since you wanna act like this we won’t come” and he blew up further more on us and offended us. At the end we don’t go so to of them had to be with us but they’ve been acting distant and one is badmouthing us to everyone we’ve made friends with. The moment I think I might be the AH is when we refused to go and two of them had to remain even thou one couldn’t make it due to physical disabilities and the others wanted to petty about it by saying she didn’t go for the 12 year old but in reality is because there wasn’t space for her but they could have taken the bigger car with nine seats and they were in six.


UPDATE 

So I wanna thank everyone who gave their opinions on this matter. Now let’s get to the mini update. Basically after returned from hiking, they were all bathing him with compliments for going while throwing snide remarks at us. They continued badmouthing us behind our backs but as soon as they need something from they act all nice and lovey?? I am honestly ignoring them for my mind’s health. The fact that they are literally ADULTS acting like teenagers while insulting us and befriending people we’ve made friends with so they can tear us apart is extremely CHILDISH. And to act normally in front of us knowing that we know what’s they’re doing??? I never knew people could be petty and basically have beef with minors that could be your children( they have children of their own and I don’t know how can be with parents like this) because they didn’t want to do something that you’ve could have done on your own in the first place and dragging us to the mud when we refused to go when given the chance by 1) denying access to a 2-week-worth pocket money 2) wishing that we weren’t with them the next year because you can’t us anymore. We (roommates and I) don’t really care but it’s quite embarrassing to know that adults that are suppose to take care of you are in reality the one that should be taken care for based on how they’ve been behaving. To sum up, next year they won’t be a vacation and I’m actually happy because I wouldn’t want to spend another with that man ever again in my life.

35,1ezlnmh,WIBTA if I didn't want to talk to my friends again after our polyamorous situationship ended?,"Throwaway acc. I (22M) is in a relationship with my girlfriend (F21). We're both polyamorous, and have experimented outside of our relationship (5 years together) for the last year or so. I was until recently in a situationship with my two best friends from college ""James"" and ""Ava"" (M21 and F21, who are in a relationship).
I made it clear with them both from the start that for me it wasn't just physical attraction, but it was never communicated to me if it was the same for them. James and I met up for a ""date"" and I communicated to him that I was really making myself vulnerable here and that I didn't want to ruin what we did have, but that I really liked him. He said he understood and said that he wanted to ""experiment"" with poly stuff and trusted me to experiment with. 
3 days later James broke it off with me, saying that Ava was not comfortable with what was going on. I was hurt and needed space. A few weeks later Ava and I were at the same college party and we sat down and talked about everything. She said that she hadn't been uncomfortable, but that she had felt left out. Later on in the night when we were drunk I asked if it would be okay to kiss her, she had been texting James all night and had been quite flirty with me so I thought she'd been talking with him about it. She said it was okay and we made out. 
Throughout the night it got more heated, she was still texting James and so I took that as her asking him when I was asking her. She said everything that was happening was okay. We ended up sleeping together, still the whole way through, I asked if what was happening was fine and I was told yes. We stayed over at the party that night and the next morning she wouldn't look at me properly, saying that she needed to talk to James about what happened.
5 days later she broke it off with me too, saying it could ""never happen again"". I was really hurt, not so much about the breakup itself but that I feel used? Like I was being used for a fun time and dropped when everything got too real?
I suggested to James that before college we should all talk about everything so that we can try get rid of any awkwardness and he said that he isn't ready to talk to me. We're back in college in just under a month. I don't think I did anything wrong, I was communicating with them a lot about my side of things and don't feel like I was given the same.

And I respond with “well I don’t want to be here all night” ( this is the point he says he got upset but I didn’t know that he didn’t say anything about it making him upset) and he says that I could offer to cook something for him and I tell him no basically. And then I mentioned that I feel like you don’t think I’m attractive cause you didn’t even say anything. Didn’t call me pretty didn’t grab my ass nada.

The next 2 hours are spent with me trying to ask him “why are you acting like this” “do you not see how your acting” cause by this point he is mocking me , yelling at me and saying he didn’t do anything wrong. He tells me that I’m the one wrong because I was inconsiderate when I said “I didn’t want to be here all night” he took what I said as me saying he can’t go shower or eat cause I want to have sex. That’s not at all what I was saying, he is notorious for staying in the shower for a long time so if I meant anything other than “I don’t want to be here all night” it could’ve been don’t be in the shower for hours.

37,1ezlcwz,AITA for suggesting my (girl)friend should stay home while we go out? (F22),"Hi everyone,

**For some context:** Me (22f) and 2 of my friends (let's call them Mina & Cris) of the same age are originally from France, and have formed a close trio since highschool. We used to go out a lot, go clubbing, meet boys, etc. We had lots of fun. With uni everyone has been moving around a lot (Erasmus and stuff) but we kept a close bond. Mina has kind of slipped into a ""happy stay-at-home grandma"" vibe. Even though I go out with other friends, including Cris, I miss partying with Mina and I often get the feeling that she kills the vibe for everyone because she wants to go home but also doesn't want us to go have fun without her. We never discussed it. 

**What:** Mina has been studying in Torino for the past semester. We visited her for 5 days with Cris. One evening, we were having coffee (5pm) with a new friend of hers that she met in Torino. Anyways, we were considering going out that same night, the new friend was checking out local events. One of them was starting at 9pm and was free, the other one starting at 12pm and cost 15€. Mina was advocating in favor of the 1st one, and stated ""it's cool, it's starting early so we can get home by like 11"". 

I explained that, for once, I would be really pleased if we could go dancing without worrying about a curfew. We exchanged opinions and it got quite tense, basically I was saying ""We could just go at any hour and see on the spot if we went to stay longer or go back home"", and Mina was saying ""You are sleeping at my place, so I should have the last word and state right now that we will be home by midnight"". Cris was saying ""there is no way we go to a club as early as 9pm"". I was getting frustrated and I did not want to start an argument, so I told Mina ""If you really don't wanna come, you can stay home"", but it was not at all aggressive, it was intended as conflict-solving. 

Anyway, she was like ""no no, I will come with you"" and indeed she came. But a few weeks later, she informed me that she does resent me a lot for it. Especially since it happened in front of her new friend, who, to Mina's saying, was ""very shocked by my behavior"". 

So, AITA ? I really don't know what to think, and I feel quite disturbed by the fact that she Mina is playing  ""new vs old friends"". Why would this new girl's opinion matter at all, she doesn't have all the context and background of our interaction?

But since I'm graduating high school this year and moving abroad for further education, I planned to disband our unit so that both of us can focus on our lives and learn new things.

K however is a bit dependent on me and has low self esteem. He doesn't have many aspirations of his own that don't overlap with my wishes. Which is why he only wants to continue doing art with me, so he wasn't thrilled about the idea of disbanding but accepted it for my sake nonetheless.
 Recently K had been acting dejected and off, so I asked him what was weighing him down. He told me that he knew I was trying to throw him away with my decision, which was not my intention at all. I just wanted to give him space to be an independent person and discover his own dreams. He cut me off saying he was just feeling blue because of the graduation season and started avoiding me.

After our last show as a unit in a small local venue, both of us were sitting in a fruit parlor and talking. The conversation was light hearted at first but quickly steered back to the topic of our disbandment where I tried explaining my reason for moving abroad for personal growth, and my wish for K to use this opportunity to find his own wishes as well. K told me that he didn't understand me. Which I don't blame him for, I tend to get a bit long winded with my explanations. As I mentioned earlier, K is very loyal to me and often obeys everything I tell him to without questions. So I decided to take a cruder approach and asked him to hurt me to see his reaction.

I told him that he should go back to his hometown and to never show me his face again. He asked me if I was throwing him away after all and I corrected him saying that I never owned him in the first place, and that I would drown his memories in my head, that I would forget about him and move on.

43,1ezkfia,AITA for yelling at my mother and running away?,"New account, mother found my old account on my laptop. 

I (17F) am studying to become a doctor, as per mother's wish. I also get high grades, but recently, my grades started to falter. I got concerned that mother would hear about the recent exam I had having a lower grade. I didn't want to let her down. So I lied to her about it being graded late.

I decided to call a friend, who I will call Y, that I won't be able to work with the group for a while. Me & Y work in an music group, with two others that will be called A & S. I know they are worried since they tried reaching out a few times. I just told them I needed to study for my grades to go up again & to not alert mother about work since she is NOT a huge fan of it. 

It didn't take long for A to call me up again for us to hang out (work) for me to relax since I was having a hard time focusing with my studies. I did end up joining Discord with the rest of the group being shocked except for A. We did end up working. The background noise of the group helped me to relax a bit. They asked me to join the next day. I said I probably can't so S will just DM me when the MV is up.

All seemed to be just fine until mother asked me of my exam, I just said the same thing. Only for her to say that she went to my school to ask for it. I just confessed about how I was afraid of her response. She then said I'd be rid of my phone because it was a distraction to my studies. I refused to give it to her but she tried to grab my phone and it flew into my aquarium.

A few days later, A & S found me at the park, asking me what happened to me, obviously worried since I never got to respond to the messages they sent. I told them what happened & S snapped and told me to stand up for myself.

I later got home to mother cooking, waiting for me to ask me something, but I asked first to let me work with the group & I'd make sure my grades would go up. She said that I shouldn't let any other distractions keep me from my studies, adding how the other kids around me working hard with good grades while mine was going down. To which I said I didn't want to be a doctor.

Unfortunately I was given a very disappointed look from her, which got me scared. She then asked if this was me doing this for my friends, not her happiness. I retorted & just yelled about how I feel. She looked even more disappointed. I even wanted to take back everything I said, until I remembered what A said, run away when everything feels like too much. I couldn't take it anymore, so I just ran. I ended up at Y's front door. I knocked & Y showed up. I just launched myself at them, crying. I don't know for how long, but I know Y was trying to comfort me, but I am scared. What do I do now?

I'm now currently in Y's house typing all of this, lost about what to do next. Mother is looking for me, to get me home. I don't know how father will react to this since he is at work & I still have to attend classes on Monday.

I (17F) am studying to become a doctor, as per mother's wish. I also get high grades, but recently, my grades started to falter. I got concerned that mother would hear about the recent exam I had having a lower grade. I didn't want to let her down. So I lied to her about it being graded late.

I decided to call a friend, who I will call Y, that I won't be able to work with the group for a while. Me & Y work in an music group, with two others that will be called A & S. I know they are worried since they tried reaching out a few times. I just told them I needed to study for my grades to go up again & to not alert mother about work since she is NOT a huge fan of it. 

It didn't take long for A to call me up again for us to hang out (work) for me to relax since I was having a hard time focusing with my studies. I did end up joining Discord with the rest of the group being shocked except for A. We did end up working. The background noise of the group helped me to relax a bit. They asked me to join the next day. I said I probably can't so S will just DM me when the MV is up.

All seemed to be just fine until mother asked me of my exam, I just said the same thing. Only for her to say that she went to my school to ask for it. I just confessed about how I was afraid of her response. She then said I'd be rid of my phone because it was a distraction to my studies. I refused to give it to her but she tried to grab my phone and it flew into my aquarium.

A few days later, A & S found me at the park, asking me what happened to me, obviously worried since I never got to respond to the messages they sent. I told them what happened & S snapped and told me to stand up for myself.

I later got home to mother cooking, waiting for me to ask me something, but I asked first to let me work with the group & I'd make sure my grades would go up. She said that I shouldn't let any other distractions keep me from my studies, adding how the other kids around me working hard with good grades while mine was going down. To which I said I didn't want to be a doctor.

Unfortunately I was given a very disappointed look from her, which got me scared. She then asked if this was me doing this for my friends, not her happiness. I retorted & just yelled about how I feel. She looked even more disappointed. I even wanted to take back everything I said, until I remembered what A said, run away when everything feels like too much. I couldn't take it anymore, so I just ran. I ended up at Y's front door. I knocked & Y showed up. I just launched myself at them, crying. I don't know for how long, but I know Y was trying to comfort me, but I am scared. What do I do now?

44,1ezk9yl,AITA for selling out my brother?,"I (17M) have an older brother who I'll call Ray (18M) and we used to get along well when we were young but the thing is, he's very popular anywhere he goes and I've always been negatively compared to him and over time I've become more and more fed up with being in his shadow.

Now this is where I met this guy at my school, Ethan (17M) who had a vendetta against Ray and his friends and recognized me as Ray's younger brother. After finding this out I offered to give Ethan dirt on him that he could use to mess with his reputation and I ended up telling Ethan a bunch of lies about him.

While all this was going out my brother also completely ditched me and left home multiple times without explaining anything to me which just made me more resentful towards him and was a big part of why I never stopped telling Ethan more stuff about him.

All this gossip I told turned out to be really effective, so much so that Ray and his friends ended up becoming really unpopular at school, while no one found out about what I did.

This all was a little while ago and Ray isn't nearly as disliked anymore and he's also very obnoxious towards me and pretends as if we're somehow on good terms but I don't like him at all.

So, AITA?

45,1ezjoar,AITA for not getting involved in a friends group dispute? ,"This is a LONG story, it happened just recently when all of us met up at a hotel for a pre-party before we hit the clubs. No detail left behind.

There were 9 of us that weekend, my friend who we’ll call Holly invited all of us to her hotel room for pre drinks over the Snapchat group before we hit the clubs all night. My other friend who we’ll call Jack brought our other friend who we’ll call Tray and a girl he was crushing hard on who we will call Millie to the room while Holly brought her small group and I brought my friend who we will call Byron.

They all brought drinks to the pre party, we’re having a good time and we blasted music in the hotel room like a bunch of inconsiderate jerks lol. After an hour of drinking, all 8 of us go out to the clubs and Holly had got us door list entry prior so we all got in for free. We go in and Jack already goes off to talk to some girls on the dance floor instead of hanging out with us, Holly didn’t like it too much as we all agreed previously to stay with the group but he ignored her. Tray gets drinks for us and we all go up to the top floor to talk (except for Jack). 

A few hours later we go to a different club and Jack runs into another girl who was friends with me who we’ll call Amy and they both get a cab and disappear the whole night just like that. Holly got pissed off and I tried to calm stuff down when they both smack talked each other in our snap group. I calm things down and told them we can restart tomorrow and everyone is on board. Millie was still pissed off with Jack so I pulled them aside to talk which didn’t go well. But we all end up meeting at the same club we went to again and pretty much the exact same shit happened except Millie went off with Jack and they ignored our texts. So me, Byron, Holly and her friends just brush it off and hit the clubs anyway and it was going well up until we went back to Holly’s hotel room for more drinks around 6 am and her friends go off to get an Uber at the entrance so me, her and Byron went in to the room and we find Jack and Millie in the bed while Tray was passed out on the floor. Holly loses her shit and tells them to fuck off out of her room and they got changed and disappeared into the street while me and Byron hid behind the wall. 

I remained neutral with both of them even when Jack, Tray and Millie broke off from the group and told me to choose them over Holly and her friends but I got pissed off with both of them and explained I wasn’t going to be the proxy of their conversations since both were shit talking each other directly to me and telling me to spy on both. 

I probably should’ve done more to keep the group stable but I just stayed silent and I feel like a total asshole because of it, I mean maybe it’s not my fault but idk.

47,1ezjl47,AITAH for not watching my in-laws incontinent dog at my house while I'm 32 weeks pregnant? ,"My husband and in-laws are traveling out of state in a month to BIL's wedding. They'll be gone 4-5 days. I'll be 32 weeks pregnant and have already been having a lot of back pain issues.

Additionally, I just started a new job that is more intensive than expected.I also homeschool my 3 kids, and we have livestock and many animals of our own to care for.

Initially, I said I'd go over to their house to take care of their cats and dog and they could keep their bird at our house. This was already going to be a lot on me with all the other responsibilities and being pregnant. But I also recommended having someone else come over a couple times earlier in the day to let the dog out.

Then, the other day, my FIL said we'd have to keep the dog at our house. I was in a haze of exhaustion from working all day and having a bad cold and just sort of nodded along without thinking about it. Then he started explaining that the dog is incontinent and will need cleaned off since he is peeing and having diarrhea on himself all day and that someone will need to sit with him constantly because he will whine all day (and will likely still whine all day anyway.)

After I’d had a chance to clear my mind, I told my husband I don't think this is a good idea because I'm not going to be able to do all my normal stuff, all his normal stuff, plus go to their house to care for their other animals, AND clean up dog pee and diarrhea all day. (I already can't stand smells as it is because of the pregnancy and get severe back pain and dizziness from bending over.)

My husband flipped out, said there's no other option, said I was being selfish and putting his parents in a bad situation. Then today, my husband ""broke the news"" to his parents and they started yelling about how they have no one else to watch the dog and we already said we would and how they're so stressed out (neither has held a job or tried to find one for the last 8 months, no small kids at home, and have been getting money from someone else to pay everything for them including taking them out to eat and paying off their new vehicle for them.) Considering this, I don't understand why they don't just hire a pet sitter for the time they're gone. If I weren't pregnant, I would try to make it work. But I'm already completely exhausted and barely keeping up with my regular responsibilities. I've expressed this multiple times throughout the pregnancy. They've SEEN me fall asleep at gatherings because of the exhaustion.

Also, they have known about this wedding for a year and haven't tried to find anyone to care for the animals. (The usual people they'd have are also going to the wedding.) Only recently did we propose the solution of me watching them (not them bringing the dog here though), and only a few days ago did my FIL suggest the dog coming to our house, so it's not like it's been months or anything that they have been expecting me to do this.

We're pretty close and this sort of thing isn't a big deal to either of us. So I go into his dresser to look for them and instead open his underwear drawer (unintentionally). In there I see a few pairs of briefs, which surprised me because I've only known him to wear boxer briefs before, like most of our other friends. I smile and pull out a pair of colored briefs and said: ""woah, you're a briefs guy now?"" as sort of a light hearted joke/inquiry. I really don't care what kind of underwear he wears and certainly don't judge him in any way for it so I'm not sure why I did that, other than just being surprised by learning something I didn't know about him.

He gets visibly upset and snatched his underwear from me and puts it back. He takes a pair of socks out and throw them at me. I mumble a ""I'm sorry man, it's no big deal"" but he sort of storms away from me with a scowl on his face. When we finally leave for the gym about 20 minutes later, he says: ""Dude, you really crossed a line back there."" I apologized again. During the entire gym session he sort of avoided me and I could tell it was weighing on him. 

When we got home I told him: ""Look, I'm really sorry for what I did and calling out the underwear. I really didn't mean anything by it and hope you don't think it's a big deal after this."" He admitted he was embarrassed about it being found out like that but says he finds briefs comfortable and really likes wearing them, but never wanted to show that he was wearing them around me to avoid any type of judgment. I am really surprised by this, since this is out of character and he isn't usually a modest guy at all. I assured him it wasn't a big deal at all and he was free to wear them around me without judgment and shame. That seemed to calm him down a bit but he still seems a little off and i rally hope that this doesn't sever trust or affect both our living situation and our friendship.

My not biological father has finally come out and admitted he knew my mom was pregnant when they first started dating but convinced himself and his family that he was the father. Some of his sisters were skeptical and I wasn't always treated the best and never really felt like I fit into that family. 

My biological father didn't know I existed.  My mom ghosted him  and started dating my dad. He will always be my dad. She did not know she was pregnant when she ghosted him. She realized she was pregnant right before she started dating my dad and they just went with it and never told bio father. 

She said she ghosted him because he was ""wierd"" which to her means nerdy. She preferred the bad boys which is what my dad was. They divorced when I was 7 because he was abusive to my mom.  My mom kept custody and my dad would take us when he wanted but it wasn't often. He even left me and my sister in the car downtown at night to go in a bar. We were under 10. This man is my dad but he is not a saint. 

When I tracked down my biological father and we got our results he was heartbroken that he never knew and more so that his mother didn't get to meet what would be his only child before she passed away. I'm not seeking a father/daughter relationship from him but I do want to know more about the family my dna came from. 

Now that I have the dna proof and found my biological family my dad wants me to bury it and keep it secret because it hurts him. 

I don't want to keep it a secret and that might make me the asshole? I get that it hurts him to have people to find out but how am I supposed to feel? I was lied to my whole life and missed out on what seems like a great family (my biological father's family has been very welcoming and supportive)

So would I be the asshole if I don't keep this secret? I feel like this is my story and part of who I am. I'm not even the ethnicity I was told I was. I would like to learn about it and be proud of the real ancestry.

I have noticed he does not wear a lot of different clothes. He wears the same joggers that have a small hole in the and he stopped wearing the other ones cause they also have a hole but on the bum area. He only has about 2 shorts as well. 

He doesn’t wear tops or jackets. Only jumpers or hoodies. 2 hoodies and 6 jumpers (enough tbh) but he doesn’t have at home clothes. So the clothes he wears outside are the same ones he wear inside the house. I am not a neat freak or anything but I change my going out clothes to my at home clothes for comfortability. One time when we were camping together (for a festival) the same clothes he wore for the past 2 days he slept in. I changed into my pyjamas but he never has any. I tried asking him nicely let’s go shopping cause you do need new clothes but he keeps saying how he hates clothes shopping like really badly. Even his parents think he should get new clothes. We basically got into an argument about whether he should go clothes shopping but he just sort of got annoyed and I was being persistent on the subject. We then kept quiet and talked about it so am I the asshole for pushing the matter? 

Edit: Just to add because I’ve seen quite a few comments with this in it but I have 0 issue with what he wears or anything but it just bothers me that he can wear the same trousers for 6 days straight or the same jumper/hoodie for 6 days as well. Like one time he spilled spicy noddles on his hoodie and he kept wearing it for the next 3 days (mind you he already worn it for 3days already) although he has other jumpers.

I tried asking him nicely let’s go shopping cause you do need new clothes but he keeps saying how he hates clothes shopping like really badly. Even his parents think he should get new clothes. We basically got into an argument about whether he should go clothes shopping but he just sort of got annoyed and I was being persistent on the subject. We then kept quiet and talked about it so am I the asshole for pushing the matter? 

Edit: Just to add because I’ve seen quite a few comments with this in it but I have 0 issue with what he wears or anything but it just bothers me that he can wear the same trousers for 6 days straight or the same jumper/hoodie for 6 days as well. Like one time he spilled spicy noddles on his hoodie and he kept wearing it for the next 3 days (mind you he already worn it for 3days already) although he has other jumpers. If he had other options he’ll feel better about changing his clothes more. But I’ll definitely take the advice with online shopping for him!!",0.0,0.8854300379753113,1,0
51,1ezixwp,AITA for asking my friend to pay me back?,"Me (M24) and my friend (M20, let's call him Eric) have been mates for a year now, and we met through mutual friends. I work a good job at a law firm and make a lot of money, especially for someone my age in this field. My buddy Eric is in his second year of college and works a college job at his college's Starbucks.

He recently borrowed $200 from me because he suddenly got some bills thrown in front of him by his landlord (sketchy) relating to damage his former roommate had done before he (his roommate) had moved out. The roommate didn't pay and so Eric was left to pay for it. He told me he only had 300 in his bank account and the bill was 400$, and he really needed the extra 100 + 100 for expenses for that month because he couldn't access his savings account due to a monthly withdrawal limit he had already gone over to pay another unexpected bill. I happily lent him the 200; I have more than 30k in my savings and make a lot of money monthly so it would not put me in any dire situation.

Two weeks had passed and he still could not access his savings, he said, because the month had not ended yet. He said his parent's lent him 300 for the remaining two weeks of the month and that he would pay me back the moment he could access his savings. I told him okay, that's all well and all, but that I would really appreciate it if he could pay me back with the money he had lent from his parents, or maybe even just 150 out of the 200 he owed me. You see; I don't like withdrawing money from my savings in order to make it through the month and would rather have some money sent back to my main account so I dont have to actively rip at my savings.

After I asked him this, he looked at me confused and said ""Why do you need it?"". That struck a cord with me and I told him that he's lent the money two weeks ago and that it's only fair to pay me back, and that I was planning on spending money tonight. He asked me if the amount he borrowed really was such a tear to my money, to which I told him that that shouldn't matter; even though I have 30k in savings and 400 in my main account; I have a right to get the money that I lent to a person, even if they may need to watch what they are getting for two weeks because of it. 150 dollars for two weeks is doable.

He told me that it was kind of lame of me to ask considering he offered to pay me back in two weeks, and considering our different life stages and occupations. He felt like it was out of paranoia of him not paying me back rather than convenience. I told him I had to go. We haven't spoken since.

  
EDT: In our original agreement he told me he would pay me back as soon as it was feasible for him and I told him not to worry too much and let me know when he had the money to pay me back. I just told him not to worry too much about it. No strict agreement, which made me think I could basically ask after two weeks.

I start freaking out, asking him why he was wearing OUR old cosplay even though he abandoned our group. I ended up saying some really horrible things to Nathan, calling him a traitor and telling him how cruel he was for ruining everything that we had.

55,1ezi42b,AITA for telling my brother he is to blame for our family issues?,"God this is such a freaking mess, and I’ll try to keep it as short as possible.

So my brother was with his ex for almost 10 years. High school sweet hearts, yada yada yada. They divorced in their late 20s, no children either since I know that will be a question. While my family wasn’t super fond of the ex, we tolerated her. She wasn’t a horrible person, just didn’t fit our family very well.

After about 2 years, my brother finally got enough confidence to get back out onto the dating scene and met Kayla. Now my family absolutely adored Kayla, mostly our mother. They bonded very quickly and became friends. They would see each other at least once a week to shop, grab dinner or do cross stitching, which her and my mom both love. They dated for about 2 years. 

Out of nowhere around 6-7 months ago, my brother decided to dump Kayla. Where did you go he ask? Him and his ex wife decided to get back together to give it a second shot. Kayla was obviously heartbroken, but with my mom’s support and her friends, she’s been getting through it. 

To say I was upset with my brother would be an understatement. I was already pissed at him for going back to his ex. But within the last month, he’s been telling my mother that he will go low contact with her if she keeps Kayla around as her friend. He says her being around all the time makes him uncomfortable, and she needs to reduce the friendship or he is going low contact. (For the record my mother doesn’t invite her over when he is. It is on her personal time she does this)

My father, who doesn’t want to lose contact has been trying to convince mom to do it because he’s family, but my mom is obviously upset because she doesn’t want to lose a son or her friend! Her and my dad have been arguing about it according to her.

I talked to my brother the other week and told him that all these problems stem from him and that they are his fault. Telling mom who she can be friends with is awful. He told me that he isn’t comfortable with it, and if she’s willing to give up a relationship with her son for someone she’s known only 2 years, that’s her prerogative. He hung up on me after that.

58,1ezhi0y,AITA for leaving my friend and joining another band after ours broke up?,"Throwaway account. I (18m) had a bandmate (19m) who we will call Sharon. A few years back, at school we had one of the most well respected bands in the whole school. The band was conformed by Sharon (19m) and Michael (17m). After a few changes on my voice, Sharon said that I was no longer fit for being the center of the band and basically did everything in his reach to get my voice back to normal. 

During one of our performances at school, the audio was cut. It forced us to perform our own vocals and revealed that we had been lip-syncing the entire time. After this incident, Sharon no longer showed up at school, and our band stopped its activity.

The very next year, I was with my friend William (18m) who said I should take care of one of the juniors, Tommy (16m) in school who happened to be in a band as well, and I took care of him and eventually joined his band which I've been in for a while now.

A few years back, at school we had one of the most well respected bands in the whole school. The band was conformed by Sharon (19m) and Michael (17m). After a few changes on my voice, Sharon said that I was no longer fit for being the center of the band and basically did everything in his reach to get my voice back to normal. 

During one of our performances at school, the audio was cut. It forced us to perform our own vocals and revealed that we had been lip-syncing the entire time. After this incident, Sharon no longer showed up at school, and our band stopped its activity.

The very next year, I was with my friend William (18m) who said I should take care of one of the juniors, Tommy (16m) in school who happened to be in a band as well, and I took care of him and eventually joined his band which I've been in for a while now.

59,1ezhf0v,AITA for my reaction to my sister’s crush?,"AITA for my reaction to my sister’s crush?

My (18F) sister (23F) has always had an interest in older men. Every celebrity crush she has is a guy around 40-50, and besides the occasional joke, I never have a problem with it or discourage her from those feelings. Again, I will make jokes, and us mutually making fun of each others “bad” taste is a running bit.

Yesterday my sister revealed to me that she has a crush on a coworker of hers. No relationship has been pursued but she does feel very intensely for him. She’s had this crush for over a year, it fizzled out, and now it’s back in full swing. I was happy and supportive of her at first and wanted to hear all about it, until she revealed the man is 14 years older than her. My sister is 23 and naive, when she was describing her crush she said that she believes he probably likes her back since he’s single, stares at her, and makes excuses to swing by her office. When I asked about his personality, she said he’s kind of a jerk, moody, and that her work BFF described him as a “borderline psychopath”. When I asked about him being single, she said he had asked out two other girls at work who both rejected him. When I asked her if he was kind, she muttered and said something like.“he’s nice to me.”. 

I’ve always been overprotective of the people in my life, this is a flaw I recognize and I’m trying to reign in those emotions. But when I heard about this guy, red flags were raised. I know this is just a crush, I don’t think my sister should be ashamed of her preferences in anyway, I also have no clue if this guy really is interested. But if he is, I find that extremely weird. Why would a 37 year old want anything to do with a 23 year old? I’m under the impression that those are two completely different mindsets/avenues of life. And I’ve heard horror stories about younger women being pursued by older men and getting stuck in toxic relationships.

After she told me, I let everything process and debated telling her my true feelings or feigning happiness. I could tell that after she revealed his age she was disappointed in how uncomfortable I was by it. She even asked me, “did you really expect anything better from me?” Which broke my heart when I heard it. I didn’t know what to say, so we went on with our evening. Later, I decided to send a message expressing my happiness over her telling me her feelings, but also expressing the uncomfortable aspects of this guy reciprocating her feelings. I made it clear she doesn’t have to listen to me, just hear me out. 
I sent it last night, this morning has been radio silence. I know she’s angry with me.

Should I have just kept in my lane and not been open about my mixed feelings on the subject? I’m aware my sister is an adult capable of making her own decisions, but I also know my sister, and while I love her, she is trusting of questionable people. We’re super close and I wouldn’t want this to come between us, but I’m so worried. AITA and blowing this out of proportion?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-23,"AITA for my reaction to my sister’s crush?

60,1ezh1lq,WIBTA if I make my family leave at 6 to do what I want for my birthday?,"So my birthday is Sunday. I know it’s childish my birthday is very special to me as it’s the only day people pay attention to me and do nice things for me. Basically every other day of the year and especially holidays I’m kinda put on the back burner with my family. I really love my brithday because I love sharing the thinks I love to do with my loved ones and this is the one day they’ll go and do it. Usually.

It’s been really hard trying to make plans with my mom and sister for it. Eve thing I want to do they turn down or complain about. Originally I really wanted to go to carowinds. I saved up for tickets for us and all the extra bells and whistles to make the day easy but my family said he’ll no. They don’t wanna walk around all day. I was disappointed but didn’t pout. I let it go and decided maybe going to an art museum I love would be a nice afternoon out. It’s an hour away but the drive is nice and I would pay for tickets. My sister has been complaining about going all the way there and how she hates walking around the museum and she doesn’t want it to be all day ordeal. 

This weekend there’s a book warehouse I’m obsessed with that does 70% off a warehouse full of books the last weekend of every once. I’ve been saving to do a big birthday haul. I absolutely love reading. And this lets me branch off and try new authors and genres for cheap. So I begged and begged for them to go with me. We would be home by 1 probably and I would leave them alone. The thing is that it’s an hour and a half away. And it’s incredibly popular. So I like getting there 20 minutes early to slip in before the crowds. I’m there for 2 hours and gone before people really start rolling in. Especially since people are in church. My sister has been upset about waking up so early to go. I feel selfish for asking this of them but it’s my last idea. At this point I’m ready to say fuck it leave me alone for my birthday but I know they’ll be upset. I don’t wanna spend it at home all day. Would I be the asshole to ask them to go with me early? 

Edit: forgot to mention I have offered solutions that don’t involve walking but they were shoot down immediately so I forgot to include.

61,1ezgvlc,"AITA for pointing out mother and brother's ""step-problems"" as a reason why I won't pursue another relationship after being widowed.","I (46M) lost my wife to cancer 4 years ago, when our two sons were 6 and 8 years old.  It was a difficult adjustment for all of us, and I'd be kidding if I said it doesn’t remain difficult, but I can also say that the boys and I have managed to move forward as a close-knit family.  They're doing great in school.  I'm fortunate enough to be well-off, so I have been able to afford therapy for all of us and plenty of help around the house.  We have an awesome roster of babysitters who the kids love.  And my late wife's sister and brother-in-law happen to live near us and have stepped up as additional adult family figures in my kids' lives.

I have not pursued any relationships since my wife's passing.  I want to focus on my kids.  It's not like I am a hermit or anything.  I have plenty of friends and I do get the opportunity to socialize, thanks to babysitters and my sister and BIL.  For sure, it's not the life I envisioned a decade ago, but I feel like I am making things work and I'm proud of our resilience as a family.

The problem is my mother (divorced from my dad and remarried) and my older brother (divorced and remarried).   A year or so after my wife's death, they started making comments about how I needed to start dating again, with the strong hint that my kids needed a mother figure around.  I found this annoying then and only more annoying as time has gone on.  The comments tend to wax and wane.  The irony is that both my mother and my brother ended up with step-kids.  In my mother's case, it happened just after I left for college, so I never lived with step-dad or step-siblings, but my younger brother did, and it was a shitshow for him.  He and the step-siblings never got along, he never recognized step-dad as father figure.   Our dad never remarried and he and my brother have a much better relationship than he and my mother do.  My older brother's family is a signal example of the phenomenon visible all over this sub of two people with kids remarrying in the belief that they are going to be the Brady Bunch but instead ending up as the Jerry Springer show.  The step-sibs war with each other and their respective step-parent.

Here's my potential asshole behavior.  At a recent family dinner (no kids, just mom, my two brothers and I), mom and older brother started in again on the ""you need to find a partner"" nonsense.  I tried to deflect it in a non-confrontational way.   “I guess my family is a like a wheelchair – we’re not designed to handle ‘steps.’”  It didn’t work, as they became defensive and that I was pig-headed to avoid dating for that reason.  I lost my temper and told them that they could do as they please, but personally I feel like the happiness of my kids is more important than having a full bed and someone to make me breakfast (brother’s wife is SAHM).  I can pay a maid or a cook if I need it, I said.   Younger brother said “amen”, but mom and other bro said my comments were cruel and insulting.  Did I overreact?

The living sister lets call her K has 2 sons. My mum had my elder brother before me who passed away years ago and my little sister who is 10 years old.

65,1ezg85l,AITA for ignoring my step father and mother at dinner?,"I (21F) recently went out with my family to have dinner at a public restaurant. I was raised by my grandparents after my mother gave birth to me at 18 and left me with them. Years later, she met a man whom my grandparents dislike for his bad behaviour but she eventually married him and had my half-sister (14F) whom i adore. 

During dinner, i did not speak to them at all because in the last dinner they decided to insult me by saying i was fat and that i became too arrogant just because my grandparents raised me. My step-father then insulted my grandparents by saying that i should have never been brought up by them because they raised me badly. They praise my little sister for being the best since she does sports, while my grandparents raised me to focus academically. They insult me by telling me the course (architecture) i chose was useless and that i was arrogant, just because of it. I love my course and i love studying it, so it really hurt that they would insult me just because my grandparents supported me for doing what i like and they didnt.

My grandparents also dislike my step-father because of his rude behavior to them. So my step-father insulting the people that raised me also hurt because not only do my grandparents support them financially, they even gave them jobs in their own businesses, basically paying them a generous salary while even paying for their own RENT as they do nothing but sit around on the job.

With this in mind, i decided to stay quiet and ignore them, because if i dont, i might say something that would make them angrier. Now they took me aside just to complain and force me to apologize for ignoring them and ""creating a gap"" and that if i dont apologize, i would be considered prideful and arrogant. They even threatened that i wont be able to see my half-sister anymore because i am a ""bad influence"".

I dont want to be the one to break familial ties with them, i tolerate my mother and step-father because i love my half-sister.

So my step-father insulting the people that raised me also hurt because not only do my grandparents support them financially, they even gave them jobs in their own businesses, basically paying them a generous salary while even paying for their own RENT as they do nothing but sit around on the job.

With this in mind, i decided to stay quiet and ignore them, because if i dont, i might say something that would make them angrier. Now they took me aside just to complain and force me to apologize for ignoring them and ""creating a gap"" and that if i dont apologize, i would be considered prideful and arrogant. They even threatened that i wont be able to see my half-sister anymore because i am a ""bad influence"".

I dont want to be the one to break familial ties with them, i tolerate my mother and step-father because i love my half-sister. I also love my grandparents and they dont deserve getting insulted by them. Was i rude for ignoring them just because i didn't want to make a scene in public? Or should i have done something different?",0.0,0.00047494913451373577,0,1

67,1ezg0bb,AITA for hiding food from my so called roommate? ,"I (30f) am pregnant and I live with my 21 year old  sister and her 21 year old boyfriend. I'm pregnant and struggling to make ends meet. I work at a Dollar store and I don't get paid no more than $200 weekly. I almost have enough saved for my own apartment before the baby comes. 

My sister's boyfriend's father lives here as well. I moved here in the month of May and the agreement was for us all four to split the rent and bills. We all do our job and pay our part except for her boyfriend's father, me and my sister always have to pick up his slack card which is why I still don't have anything for this baby yet and I'm due in November. 

I recently discovered his secret, he has a drug problem. Which explains why he wakes up in the morning at 6am to get on the freeway and go panhandle and doesn't come back until 10pm. He makes at least $20 to $100 a day and he lies and says he never gets paid. I saw a sketchy looking guy in a black truck pull up to this house and put something in the mailbox. I go outside and check the mailbox and it's something brown and in powder like. I didn't touch it because it was inside a envelope. A few minutes later after I witness that, he goes outside for a few seconds and comes back in so I immediately knew what was going on. 

I told my sister what happened and she immediately blew it off but she never been around drugs before so of course that would be her response. I know what they look like because my mother was heavily addicted to them in my childhood. 

I always come home and expect to eat things that I've been craving at work all day just to find out that he's ate it all. I tell my coworkers and they think I'm being petty about it. I'm not. Times are extremely hard for me and food prices have went up. Maybe I am being an asshole but I have no sympathy for a 41 year old man that spends all his money on drugs but has to steal food from a pregnant woman or rely on his son and his son's girlfriend to feed him. 

I literally have to HIDE food and sometimes he STILL finds it. My sister ordered a mini refrigerator from Amazon to keep in their room because he does the same thing to her. It must be nice. I don't even have a room in this house, I sleep on the couch. I honestly feel like he needs to be the one sleeping on the couch since he's not paying any bills but that's a story for later.

68,1ezfyyr,AITA for rejecting my juniors festival show idea?,"I (17 F) am in charge of a festival that happens every year at our school which also features a stage and show. This year a small school band was supposed to play because they recently won a local competition so I wanted to reserve the spot for them.

Now, recently someone just transferred here, someone i used to know back then, who i will call Miya (15 F). Miya was appearently looking forward to transfer to my school. For some reason she was really excited for this festival and wanted to help. Miya was determined to plan the show, but her idea was that the orchestra group that i was in would perform on the stage. She is aware of the band that was supposed to play but she insisted.

Earlier this week she personally came to my classroom to show her proposal of the festival. I dont remember how it happened it exactly but i told her that id have to decline the proposal. I was already feeling unwell that day when she stormed out of the room, almost crying, right after i said it. She hasn’t been talking to me the past week and i dont know how to apologize, but i dont think i was being too rude about it and was just telling her the truth.

Her brother (16 M) told me that Miya was really looking forward to this festival and wanted it to go perfect, despite the fact that the others were supposed to perform. She appearently worked super hard on it and really just wanted the best for me.

69,1ezfu13,AITA for wanting a clean home ,"This morning I woke up to two pools of dog piss and dog shit, diarrhea, on our couch. I’ve been trying my hardest to train them, night time is the longest they go and because they’re already older they’re more difficult to train. 

My fiancé goes to work a little after 5am, I stay at home due to an event that made me need a break from work and difficultly finding a new job, so obviously I let them them out whenever they need throughout the day because I’m home to do so.

I’ve asked that before my fiancé leaves and after he’s home, he takes them out because they are his dogs, but I do everything, I don’t mind because I’m here all day, but I think once he gets home, it’s his responsibility. 

He will not let them out before work but unless he’s leaving that stuff when he sees it in the morning(which is a huge problem, if he is, I can’t do dog shit, that’s why I personally never got myself a dog, even though I want one) they’re doing it between when he leaves and I get up.

I don’t wake up until 9:30-10 am, I could wake up earlier but I don’t need that long to clean up and stuff and it feels pointless to get up so early just to let the dogs out, when he could do it before he leaves, they only go out for like 3-5 minutes each and we only have two.

This morning when I woke up to that I was extremely mad, our couch is ruined(it’s made of like wool material almost, idk, but super absorbent) because the shit obviously soaked in, and I cannot clean it (I’ve had stomach problems for 4ish years, puking mostly, and dog shit is the biggest trigger) so he’ll have to when he gets home, but he sucks at cleaning, especially with this couch, it’ll be impossible for him. 

So I texted him and gave him 3 options. 1 I leave, 2 he steps up and lets his dogs out in the am, or 3 he gets rid of them since he can’t be bothered to take care of them. I feel guilty because I really love them so much and being engaged his problems are mine, but they were not trained properly by him and his mom and I’m the one that has to solve it? He told me I need to wake up earlier cause he works all day and doesn’t have the time, I did not go and buy them then let them grow up using the house as a litter box, I would’ve trained my dogs. And now it’s exhausting they’re already 2 and 3, I’m not a dog trainer.

They were 1 and 2 when I moved in, but I was working and my fiancé wasn’t, I let them out before I left for work everyday and once I got home sometimes, considering he wasn’t up till I got home most days.

70,1ezftbs,AITA for telling my future ILs that my decision to change my name is none of their business and to quit the insensitive comments?,"I (22f) will be getting married next year. I'm taking my fiancé's last name and with changing my last name, I will also be petition the courts to change my first name. This has been a long time coming. My name doesn't hold anything positive for me and I have been going by my almost name since I was 12. So it made sense to make the change official.

I was abandoned as a baby, grew up in foster care and nobody knows if I had a name before. But I was given the name Charlotte by someone involved in my case early on and that was the name put on my birth certificate. It never held any great meaning. Since I was never adopted I never got named by loving parents either and the name always just felt wrong, weird, and tied to nothing important. When I met my best friend she told me I looked like a Kenzie and I've been Kenzie ever since.

My fiancé thinks it's great I'm making the change. But his parents are opinionated on this. They asked me before why I would rather be something cutesy like Kenzie instead of mature and pretty like Charlotte and they told me how complicated it would be to change all my documents to reflect my new name. They told me Charlotte sounds more like a professional woman, a wife and a mother than Kenzie. I showed them that even my work ID has Kenzie on it already because we can use preferred names at my job. But they didn't want to hear it.

When they found out I got advice on if it would be possible to change both names at the same time and obtained the forms, they questioned my motives more and more. They told me Charlotte was lovely and it was their second choice for a girl.

My fiancé has told them repeatedly that this is not their decision and it's my name ultimately. He also reminded them that everyone calls me Kenzie already. 

But it wasn't the end and they bring up how names are a gift of love from a parent to a child. It's a blessing to be named by parents. And they bring up far too often how much time and effort parents put into naming their kids. They know I wasn't named by a parent, that I was abandoned and named by someone who basically never saw me again. My fiancé told them those comments needed to stop. But last weekend when some of my fiancé's extended family were at his parents house and we stopped by, they were talking about it again and I might have snapped, just a little. I told them my decision to change my name is none of their business, zip, zero business of theirs, and quit with the insensitive comments about parents naming people because I was named by a random person who was part of my original abandonment case. They told me I didn't need to be so rude in their own home and I was acting like they couldn't talk about naming children without aiming it at me. My fiancé told them they knew what they were doing and I wasn't rude, I was honest. But they said I disrespected them in their own home.

Mind you in Canada, winter are pretty rough for guys who's working in construction. So pretty rare they have jobs. So less money. And the owner of his last appartement gave him a notice of expulsion. So we took him to help. No big deal at that point. So we help him in all the way you can imagine. No paying on anything and gave him food. Normal. And he restarted to work at spring. So we started to charge him. Mind you we pay 1600$ a month. 100$-200$ for electricity and water. 68$ for wifi. So for a room we charge him 300$ only that. So now here comes the problem.

73,1ezf48k,AITA for asking my friend when she wants to pick me up?,"So, some background for you to get to know the both of us a little. My (F47) and my friend Carina (F49) got to know each other at work in 2006 and started hanging out after I quit that job in 2008. We've travelled together many times, hung out a lot as in going on hikes, going to lunch, dinner, the movies, shopping. Like friends do. Almost on a weekly basis, sometimes more often, sometimes less.

I as a person am an empath. I know my faults, I know my strengths, I can apologize when I've hurt someone, or made a mistake. I often tend to be the diplomat when others argue. I want everyone to be happy and content.

Now, my friend on the other hand, is known to be a bit difficult. She can be harsh when it comes to other people not living up to her expectations, morals, way of thinking, etc.

The prickly part has affected me many, many, many times. But I've always decided that it's not worth a fight. Carina can NOT apologize when she has hurt someone, or made a mistake. She ""doesn't make mistakes"" and ""if they're hurt, that's not my problem"". She also has almost no time management whatsoever.

Now to what happened. We hade agreed to go to lunch together. It's a bit off, and as I don't have a car, I asked the night before if we were going to commute, or take the car. ""We're taking the car.""

When I contacted her the on the morning of Saturday in order to find out how I needed to manage my time, I asked ""At what time do you want to pick me up?"".

That set her off. She ""doesn't like it when I express myself like that. It is extremely provocative. I'm not your private chauffeur. Ask me when we want to be there, fine. Ask me if we are going to meet up someplace, fine. But that's not ok.""

This was one of those ""Is it worth it"" situations for me. And I decided it was. Because I have never, ever acted as if she is my private chauffeur. That would mean I would have TOLD her when to pick me up. It would mean that I expect her to drive me to places where I have errands to take care of while she waits in the car. Even if she used the wrong word to describe how she felt, I still didn't ask with any other intent than managing my own time. If I had asked when she wants to leave, that would mean nothing to me, as she never does leave when she says she will.

Se just isn't trustworthy with time. And even if I had asked ""Where should we meet up"", she would have to actually pick me up at that location.

So for once, I stood my ground. I said that that is not what I meant and she knows it. And that if she interprets it that way, that's on her and not me.

But I need your help to answer the question.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-23,"AITA for asking my friend when she wants to pick me up? So, some background for you to get to know the both of us a little. My (F47) and my friend Carina (F49) got to know each other at work in 2006 and started hanging out after I quit that job in 2008. We've travelled together many times, hung out a lot as in going on hikes, going to lunch, dinner, the movies, shopping. Like friends do. Almost on a weekly basis, sometimes more often, sometimes less.

I as a person am an empath. I know my faults, I know my strengths, I can apologize when I've hurt someone, or made a mistake. I often tend to be the diplomat when others argue. I want everyone to be happy and content.

Now, my friend on the other hand, is known to be a bit difficult. She can be harsh when it comes to other people not living up to her expectations, morals, way of thinking, etc.

The prickly part has affected me many, many, many times. But I've always decided that it's not worth a fight. Carina can NOT apologize when she has hurt someone, or made a mistake. She ""doesn't make mistakes"" and ""if they're hurt, that's not my problem"". She also has almost no time management whatsoever.

74,1ezew9h,WIBTA for traveling to my brother’s state and not seeing him?,"I (23f) have a brother (29m) who lives in Houston with his wife (30f). He expressed recently that he’s a little upset that nobody flies down to visit them (from New York) and that they’re always the one who make the trip up. I’m still in school and working so it’s a lot for me to make the trip and I’ve said this.

Here’s the problem: I’m a massive figure skating fan and one of the biggest early season events is in Dallas. The flights and event tickets are dirt cheap and it’s on a weekend. I really would like to go and meet up with some friends there, but I’m worried that I would be the asshole if I fly all the way to their state and not see them at all. Going before or staying any later would clash with my class schedule or else I would fly to them afterwards. 

I understand that they feel alienated from the family and I do want to fix that, but this event is something I really want to go to. I feel like it may be selfish for me to choose a skating competition over visiting them, especially since I’ve expressed my tight budget and pretty heavy schedule. 

Edit: my concern is that I would have to do one or the other, as I’m aware how far apart the two cities are. I’m just worried that I’ll come across as uncaring and if I’m going to fly to Texas, it should be for them and not watching sports.

78,1ezejox,AITA for Defending My Boyfriend Because My Friend Called My Boyfriend Controlling Who Comes to My Doctor Appointments All the Time,"Hello Everybody, I think a little bit of backstory is needed for this situation. Me (24F) and my boyfriend (24M) are dating for 2.5 years and my boyfriend is studying medicine and it’s his last year. The hospital he interns is the best hospital in my city might be the best in the state so when i need to go to the doctors, I try to arrange my appointments when he is in the hospital so that he can come with me. The hospital is quite big and he helps me with that also having someone with you for your appointments is quite good overall. He actually comes into the doctor with me during the consultations ( I sometimes panic during the appointments and tend to forget what drs say, so he reminds me) and usually I don’t have any problems with that, when I don’t want him in I tell him and he waits me outside. So the issue is  I recently had a surgery on my nose ( I had septum deviation) and I had a control appointment 2 weeks after the surgery where my boyfriend also came with me. In the appointment they look into your nose with thin camera that they see from a tv to see the stitches and the overall healing process and he watched it all. After the appointment i met with my friend and I told her about the appointment and she was so shocked about my bf coming into the appointment and watching the camera footage of my nose. She said that it is very controlling of him to going into the appointment with me and listening everything the doctor says. I explained to her that I actually prefer him in there since he is also a doctor and eases my panic to that, she told me that I act like a pick me who is incapable of handling her own appointments and he is probably disgusted by me because he saw inside of my nose. She said that inside of someone’s nose is a disgusting place for a partner to see. She finally concluded that I actually I take away the time that he should spend on his patients. To that I said that they work in rotation so he comes in when his colleague is working and he is free but she didn’t budge. All she tried to talk about was this 3 topics whenever I tried to change the topic she wouldn’t let me. Throughout this conversation she spoke in a calm and sweet but demanding tone she didn’t sound mad or anything so if I snapped at her I thought I would overreact. Whole evening was weird and I left shortly after my efforts of changing the topic. Now I’m ashamed that my boyfriend saw inside of my nose lol how should I talk to my friend about how it bothered me or should I act like nothing happened?

Later, when they got a cake for Adrianne, I insisted on blowing out the candles myself, and my parents let me do it because they didn’t want to deal with another meltdown and told Adrianne she was too old to be making a fuss over her birthday anyway.

I honestly don’t remember much from that day, but apparently, it really hurt Adrianne. She wasn’t even allowed to celebrate with her friends like she wanted because she had to come on that family trip.

Fast forward to now, and I’m applying to colleges, specifically in the state where Adrianne lives. Over the years, I’ve come to realize just how toxic some of our family dynamics are, and I reached out to Adrianne to apologize for what happened when I was a kid.

82,1ezea4p,AITA for not updating my girlfriend when I was out with friends?,"Me (31M) with my girlfriend (37F). Last weekend my girlfriend was out of town on a girls trip. Since she was out of town, I planned to grab a drink with my friend at a bar on Saturday night and let her know – she just asked that I text her when I got home that night. I texted to let her know when I arrived at the bar which was at 7:30 PM. When I showed up at the bar, it turns out my friend had invited a few more people than just him, which I was fine with. But there were a few friends that I hadn’t caught up with in a bit so I stayed a little later than I otherwise might have if it were just me and my friend 1:1.

The place closed at 10, so I left right around then. On my way home, I got a text from her at 10:08 asking if I was okay and I responded at 10:16 when I pulled in the driveway that yes, everything was fine and I just made it home. She then called and let me know she was upset that I wasn’t in touch with her while I was there to let her know that there were more people there and that I might stay later because of it.

Last weekend my girlfriend was out of town on a girls trip. Since she was out of town, I planned to grab a drink with my friend at a bar on Saturday night and let her know – she just asked that I text her when I got home that night. I texted to let her know when I arrived at the bar which was at 7:30 PM. When I showed up at the bar, it turns out my friend had invited a few more people than just him, which I was fine with. But there were a few friends that I hadn’t caught up with in a bit so I stayed a little later than I otherwise might have if it were just me and my friend 1:1.

The place closed at 10, so I left right around then. On my way home, I got a text from her at 10:08 asking if I was okay and I responded at 10:16 when I pulled in the driveway that yes, everything was fine and I just made it home. She then called and let me know she was upset that I wasn’t in touch with her while I was there to let her know that there were more people there and that I might stay later because of it.

83,1eze4wy,AITA for feelin like my [28M] boyfriend is asking too much of me [25F] by pressuring me to contribute and make money in a foreign country?,"Me and my boyfriend have been together for many years now. I am from Europe and he is from North America and we recently decided to move together in his home country as we're planning to stay together long term and eventually tie the knot.

Right now I am living with him in his country on a temporary resident visa until I continue my studies here. He works in the medical field and currently is the sole breadwinner aside from money I make by selling my art or other small trinkets.

Everything has been going well except for one aspect of the relationship, he keeps talking about money and pressuring me to contribute to the rent and the expenses while we live together. 

Now I'm not against working at all, hell, if I could get a stable job here I would gladly do it and contribute as much money as I can. However, I literally cannot work at the moment because I am here on a visa. 
To compensate I try to do everything at home, cleaning, cooking, meal prepping, waking up early and packing him lunch for work, taking care of getting groceries and budgeting... Etc. I try not to spend any money on myself as I genuinely feel guilty about it especially when he keeps mentioning it. He doesn't want me to work a physical job, just find ways to make money online, but it really is not that easy.

I've told him that if he wants me to work so badly, we could simply get married as we've been together for close to 10 years so I can be allowed to work and get a decent job (I have a masters degree back home), but he says he doesn't want to do it until I prove myself and show that I can contribute financially to the relationship.

It's stressing me out so bad, and even the money that I make on the side I can't keep at all, I have to give it to him for rent and other expenses otherwise he gets upset and holds it against me.

Aside from this aspect, he is an amazing partner but this is truly taking a toll on me and I don't know if I am justified in feeling wronged or feeling like he's asking too much of me.

I may not have been clear on this, but I accept the judgment of what looks like the majority, while I appreciate all the people who agreed that the kid's father totally overreacted. Thanks everyone!>

Went to a sports event with my wife and son, and brought a friend along with her son since we had extra tickets. We had general admission seats, which were valid for the upper deck. Lower levels were reserved seating. I had been at the venue the previous evening and security had let people move down a level to the mezzanine after a while, since there were numerous empty seats.

There were empty seats again, so we decided to sit in empty seats in the mezzanine again. As some people showed up late, we simply got up and moved a couple of times, no problem. At some point the event became more crowded than the prior evening and we temporarily had to split up.

With our kids happily sitting a few rows away there was one empty seat on the aisle next to a family of four. Their son, who looked about 12, was in the second seat, so I sat next to him, and just to be sure I asked him if the seat was taken. Well, his dad took exception to that and said ""It's kind of rude to ask my son that."" I was taken aback and just said ""Rude?"" He said, ""You know it's not YOUR seat, right?"" I said, yes, so I'm just asking if it's taken. His reply was ""Don't talk to me. Don't talk to my son again."" At that I just said ok and left the bad vibes for a different location at the earliest opportunity.

Pretty soon a bunch of other people left, and I just sat next to my kids again. And then that family left too.

I felt like that guy totally overreacted to what was a pretty standard question. If someone had asked my son (who is a little younger) the same thing, there would have been no issue. I'm thinking what really upset him was that I didn't pay the same for the seat, which I could see being a bit annoying, but lots of people were moving down.

But it's bugging me because he acted like me talking to his son for a second made me into some kind of creep, and I'm a father myself.

So to get it out of my system, I'm putting it here: AITA?

85,1ezdyor,AITA for not consenting to my husband's twin brother moving in with us?,"My husband and I got married less than a year ago. For most of our relationship one of our biggest issues and cause of arguments has been his family.

My husband has a large family and including half-siblings, he is 1 of 12 children. This includes his twin brother, Sam, who has autism. One of his younger brothers also has autism but is higher functioning.

Previously, before we married, one of my husband's brothers moved in with us for 8 months. I knew going into it that it was going to be temporary and therefor okayed it. However, I made clear then that his family members staying with us wasn't really ideal for me.

Both of my husband's autistic brothers have spent most their lives living with their grandpa. However, back in 2018 they decided it was no longer appropriate for Sam to live with their grandpa due to his higher care needs. Sam moved in with their oldest sister and has lived there ever since. Sam is mostly non-verbal and although he has some independence skills, he needs help with everyday tasks and shouldn't really be left home alone for more than an hour.

My SIL's youngest child left home early last year and she's now planning to move in with her eldest son and her grandkids. She can only do this if she can find a new home for Sam.

Recently, my husband came to me and told me he wanted Sam to move in with us. He argued we have the space, and he has the time to look after Sam. He thinks as Sam's twin it's his duty to be the one to take Sam in. He also said their sister is still going to be spending a lot of time with Sam.

I feel bad but I told him I didn't want Sam to live with us. This would be a long-term living arrangement not temporary like his other brother. I told him he should have told me before marriage that he would be wanting his brother to live with us. I feel because he didn't it's my right to say no now.

This is a big change that will affect the rest of the foreseeable future and our future plans of starting a family.

Yesterday, my husband and I were at my SIL's home discussing Sam's future and I told her I didn't want Sam to move in with us. I suggested to her if she stayed in house to look after Sam, my husband and I can try to be a bigger help to her.

She became annoyed with me after that and complained she's been looking after her younger siblings since kindergarten, became a teen mom and raised 7 kids of her own, and she can finally now have the time to do what she wants. I expressed my opinion that she was being cold to Sam who is incredibly attached to her, I could see him getting very depressed living away from her. She got mad at me after that. Although my husband said he would only take Sam in with my consent, I can tell he’s going to hold it against me if I don’t.

Some year pass and my mum lives in my country again (bc her husband/my stepdad is in the military) and then my grandparents decided that i should live with her while they go on vacation, and living with her was the worst (that’s gonna be another story) so she kicked me out bc i tried committing. my dad has a newborn with a new girlfriend that doesn’t like me… my grandparents got back from their vocation and my psychiatrist decided that i should live with them, get clean, and take my medication right and try to calm down my anxiety and level down my depression (i was getting neglected at my mum’s)

When i knew that idea i got really worried/pissed, he’s mentally ill, addicted to alcohol i see him drunk all the time, my grandfather has to bring him food EVERYDAY, he also can’t clean up after himself, yk those TV shows of really dirty houses? I’M NOT OVERREACTING when i say that the house for sale looked like those… and overall i really didn’t want my recovery with him around.

87,1ezdm8j,AITA: bus stop parents are using our private drive as a playground,"I live on a private drive containing three homes on and have been dealing with parents and their children issues for over the past 3 years. Many of the issues deal with the children using the private drive as a playground and trespassing into my property, neighbors properties, and the parents allowing this behavior. 

Parents and children also block access to the private drive daily on school days in the mornings and afternoons when I am typically leaving and returning for work. It can sometimes take a few minutes for the parents and waiting children to move in order for me to enter and exit my property. Parents and children (over 12 parents and around 25 children) also typically spend 30 minutes or over an hour (more of a problem in the afternoon) using the private drive as a playground. Which I find concerning since myself and neighbors are legally responsible for the private drive and worry about possible accidents or injuries. 

Also, in years past we’ve had multiple problems with the children using our garage door as a football and soccer goal but seemed to have worked those issues out with the parents in past years. Another issue is the end of the year massive water balloon party that the parents throw for the children… 

I’ve tried talking with parents a few times over the years about not using the private drive as a standing point and playground but have been mostly ignored. Again I tried talking to parents yesterday and was told that ""I was ruining their children's childhoods"" by asking that they not use the private drive as a playground and they will continue to do as they please. 

Earlier in the week I reached out to the bus coordinator and they have moved the pickup and drop off further back but this has not fixed any of the issues. I reached out by email to school’s principal this morning. I don’t want to involve local law enforcement but after yesterday's interaction with the parents and if it continues this afternoon I will strongly be considering it.

88,1ezdi72,WIBTA if I rescind permission for In-laws to stay overnight?,"Hey reddit, posting on a throwaway as my spouse follows my main and I want to know if I'd be TA before bringing it up with them.

I (32M) and my spouse (31M/NB) were recently at a family wedding (their side) where my biggest boundary was stomped and somewhat invalidated more than once. For context I have always had and still do have a firm ""no photographs"" boundary.

Anyway their mother, my MIL was taking pictures at the hotel while we were waiting for the coach to the venue. I purposely moved out of frame each time to avoid having my picture taken, or put my back to the  camera if I couldn't move out of frame. I then clearly stated that I don't want my picture taken, and requested that she not included me in any further photographs. She laughed and said that was ridiculous, and that it's likely I'll end up in a photograph at some point through the day in the background. I reiterated that I don't want to be photographed, and will happily move out of the way to avoid being in a picture if asked.

During the drinks reception MIL is taking images of other guests, as is the professional photographer hired by the brides. The photographer seems to quickly get the gist that I don't want to be in pictures and starts framing shots without me in them or making it obvious they're about to take a picture so I have time to move or turn away. 

I notice MIL holding her phone up at the grouping I'm in with my spouse and go to move away, but she laughs and says ""Too slow, I got you already. haha"" and I'm immediately irritated because I'd told her my boundary barely two hours ago.

I go over (names changed for anonymity)
Me: ""Jan, remember I don't like being photographed, please delete that picture with me in it.""
MIL: ""Don't be daft Greg, it's just a picture. Get over yourself.""
Me: ""Do you need a reminder on the concept of consent? Don't make me drink the tea"" in a joking tone
MIL: ""I'm not posting it anywhere, it's for personal use. It's only going to be on my phone.""
Me: ""And I don't really care, I don't want to be photographed and you've taken it without my permission.""
MIL: ""I'm not posting it anywhere.""
Me: ""I still don't care, you shouldn't have it at all.""
She laughed again and walked away, and I didn't want to make a scene at the wedding so I left it that.

MIL, FIL and my spouse's younger sibling (12) are coming to our city for a concert in December and, prior to the wedding, had arranged to stay overnight at our house.

I don't feel comfortable with allowing MIL in the house I live in, especially overnight when I cannot trust her to respect my boundaries.

So, WIBTA if I rescind permission for MIL (and by extension FIL and sibling) to stay overnight when they go to their concert? It's a two yes, one no household.

I notice MIL holding her phone up at the grouping I'm in with my spouse and go to move away, but she laughs and says ""Too slow, I got you already. haha"" and I'm immediately irritated because I'd told her my boundary barely two hours ago.

I go over (names changed for anonymity)
Me: ""Jan, remember I don't like being photographed, please delete that picture with me in it.""
MIL: ""Don't be daft Greg, it's just a picture. Get over yourself.""
Me: ""Do you need a reminder on the concept of consent? Don't make me drink the tea"" in a joking tone
MIL: ""I'm not posting it anywhere, it's for personal use. It's only going to be on my phone.""
Me: ""And I don't really care, I don't want to be photographed and you've taken it without my permission.""
MIL: ""I'm not posting it anywhere.""
Me: ""I still don't care, you shouldn't have it at all.""
She laughed again and walked away, and I didn't want to make a scene at the wedding so I left it that.

MIL, FIL and my spouse's younger sibling (12) are coming to our city for a concert in December and, prior to the wedding, had arranged to stay overnight at our house.

I don't feel comfortable with allowing MIL in the house I live in, especially overnight when I cannot trust her to respect my boundaries.

So, WIBTA if I rescind permission for MIL (and by extension FIL and sibling) to stay overnight when they go to their concert? It's a two yes, one no household.

Tl;Dr MIL stomped my no photographs boundary, and I don't want her in my home, WIBTA to take back permission?",1.0,0.021501006558537483,0,0

90,1ezdbte,WIBTA if I refuse to help my dad with his job searching,"So my(23f) dad(48m) asked me to find him a job and I just don’t want to do that. He is a CFO in some company but he has been working there for the last decade and the salary hasn’t increased in a while. He is unhappy with his workplace and wants to make a change. 

I work in IT as a PM, most of my friends are software developers, some work in IT recruitment. I know something about this industry and not much about other industries. My dad asked me to review some vacancies for him so I told him what I know from my friends and experience (which is rather little). I told him that I don’t know much about his field of work (his recent background is in logistics and power) but I can look something up in mine. I referred him for some CFO vacancies in IT and warned that he has to learn more about tech management and probably start from a lower position.

After that we had a heated debate. Basically my dad doesn’t believe in any approach to product development that is not linear. I explained to him that he has to know how to budget for Agile if he wants to work there and there is no way around it. He basically said it’s dumb and Agile is the reason developers never get anything done. 

I sent him some other vacancies I found by simply googling “job search” but to be honest I was literally doing copy/paste and he didn't like them either way.

We left the topic for a while. But recently my dad texted me again and gave me a task to find him a job. I am really confused right now. I love my dad and we have a great relationship but I feel like I already did my best the last time only to hear that my job is useless.

The thing is he is basically asking me to be his assistant. I have no connections outside IT so the only thing I can do is to scroll through hiring sites copying links for him and I have no desire to do that. I have a full-time job and am getting my masters degree. I could say I have no time but honestly I just feel like it’s absolutely useless.

I don’t completely know where it stems from but I have some of an idea. I have a sister that is 6 years older than me, growing up she was the star child, straight a student, never got in trouble. Now she has twins, 3 degrees, and a fiancé. Happy home from an outside perspective. Me on the other hand I was the trouble child, maintained good grades in school but was always in some type of mess. I never got any praise for what I did right, my mother never ordered my senior pictures and all the family pictures in the house are of my sister and her family. 
In the peak of Covid my mom had 2 total hip replacements, I was only in my junior year of high school and I sacrificed my peace and experience as a teenager to take care of her. My parents are married, my dad works all the time (2 jobs) and so I was the only one home to take care of her. My mother became so dependent on me, I was her emotional support, she became attached to me. I never noticed it was a problem until the past year or so. 
I am always the one to clean up the house behind everyone, my mom babysits her grandchildren 3 days a week, almost 12hrs a day. It has been like that since they were born, another discussion though. She rarely cleans up after them, never cleans up after herself when she cooks, doesn’t even clean her bedroom. She is so lazy that she called me in the kitchen to get her food out the bag that was literally sitting on the table not even a foot from her. 
She has helped me a lot financially from the times where I’ve totaled loss my cars and was in between jobs, emotional support? None. She even called me a wh0r3 when she found out I was getting busy in highschool.
We got into a very bad verbal altercation that turned physical back in May, I had orientation for nursing school that morning I couldn’t leave the house because she wasn’t out the bed, letting my niece and nephew roam free around the home. She confronted me about my attitude and I told her she was lazy and it went from there. She did put me out of the house for a few days but she let me come back, she doesn’t feel no way towards me for that but it hasn’t been the same on my end since.

My girlfriend, friends and I have a holiday planned for later this year and we’re now booking flights. Originally, we were meant to book flights on the 29th and arrive in Bali on the 29th. My friend however has suggested we take a flight on the 28th with a stop over in Singapore and still arrive in Bali on the 29th at 9:55am and save $200+.

I told my girlfriend this idea and she is not keen for it at all as she wants to fly direct and not with a stopover. Her reasoning, she doesn’t want to fly without me (flight from my country to Bali is 6 hours),  my friends and I will miss our flights because we will be drunk, and she doesn’t want to be in a foreign country alone which is completely understandable 

I’ve already told my girlfriend that I’d  get to Bali before or around the same time as her and I’d be waiting for her right when she landed, she’d have 2 friends of hers on the flight with her. The main part is, I will be in Bali before her waiting as I’ve already shown her flights where she’ll arrive after or around the same time we arrive

I’ll also add, I’ve invited her to come with us, she doesn’t want too

She is now very angry at me and says I’m being selfish

I did invite my girlfriend to come with us but the 9 hour flight from my country to Singapore is too much

The father of the oldest has full custody of the daughter and the youngest daughter father passed away from an overdose. Well the father of the oldest has been caring for the youngest because my sister went MIA before she went MIA, child services were involved because the youngest was being dragged from house to house with my sister and wasn’t taking her to doctors appointments and PT/OT and the father that was taking care of her was providing just the basic needs (food,shelter) he was also not taking her to doctors or anything because he is not the true father. Well child services took her and placed her in our care temporarily and we agreed because its family and we love our niece. She ended up being more than what we thought and has totally turned our life upside down because now its more long term and it’s putting us in a position where we have to choose the life we love child free or giving ourselves this huge responsibility we didn’t initially want because its family. No one else in the family can take her on because they have kids and their own responsibilities but they also don’t want to see her go to strangers. Would we be the AH if we choose to not care for her long term? ",0.0,0.12498916685581207,0,1
97,1ezch5l,AITA for not telling my spouse I created an emergency fund without telling them?,"When first married I sold some personal things and put the money in an emergency fund - roof leak, job loss, emergency room visit, whatever may happen. My goal was to be able survive a large unexpected expense or a few months of no income without going under financially because of it.

For context, I had items of value I could sell (obviously) but very little cash available and she had virtually no cash available. We had plans to make enough to support ourselves with a little over the bare necessities (rent, food, utilities, etc) but not by much.

I didn't tell my spouse about doing it.
Partly because I didn't want her to feel bad I had sold things that while not critical, I wanted. Partly because I didn't want her to be considering it when making financial decisions since it was supposed to be an emergency only fund and I could see re-buying the items if we ever became financially stable and could create an emergency fund on our own later.
Partly because it never touched out joint income or expenses, normal accounts, and for all intents and purposes would not impact our shared finances if not used.

This may not need to play into your response much, but she was raised making poor financial decisions. Not necessarily her fault - you only know what you know. But I still worried about how she may feel or react knowing there was substantial money that could be quickly accessed.

Other detail: we have shared finances and try to make joint decisions for large purchases.

It came up recently. When it came up, she felt that I had kept extensive financial secrets, failed to be appropriately honest and transparent, made decisions on her behalf, showed I don't believe in her ability to make good financial choices, disrespected her, and she's generally crushed and says she can't trust me.

It was not malicious and I had no negative or bad intentions.
However, I did keep it from her and it was partly because her history prior to and since has shown poor financial choices as she claims.

99,1ezby6q,AITA For Having Second Thoughts?,"OP (56) wondering if my decision was the best one. For years it has always been kind of joked about that one day my mom would move in with me and my husband. Well, that day came on June 26th, 2024. Everything has been challenging from day one.

Our daughter lived with us up until a little over a year ago. When we moved from one state to another, she decided to stay behind a get her own place due to loving her job. My husband is retired, and I work remotely so moving was exciting. I finally get to live at the beach!

Of course, with my daughter staying behind we had an extra bedroom in our new home. Then mom moved in. While helping her setup her bedroom, she asked my husband to hang some pictures for her. My husband is very meticulous when doing any project. He's the measure twice type to insure it's perfect. She was standing there watching him and kept telling him ""That's not straight."" After hearing this several times, he went and grabbed a level to show her everything was indeed straight and exactly where she asked him to hang it. Every day is becoming a challenge for us. The only activities she wants to do is get up in the morning, get her coffee, sit down to read her paper (which my husband drives to the gas station every morning to get for her because we do not live in an area where it is delivered), and does crossword puzzles. She has no motivation to do her laundry, dust and vacuum her room, or anything out of her normal routine mentioned above. Her personal hygiene routine is non-existent. She has gone 8 days without showering or bathing. She speaks very negatively of everything. She said something to my husband about one of our neighbors the other day. My husband told her ""We have made friends with our neighbors and don't speak about them like that."" She got angry and stormed off to her room. We are animal lovers and have 3 dogs. If the dogs don't come to her when she calls she tells them they are a\*\*holes. There is a stray cat in the neighborhood that had 2 kittens. They choose to seek shelter under our house. We took some food out to them one day and she told us ""You need to get rid of them."" This turned into a major argument.

I just don't know what to do at this point. If I say anything she doesn't agree with, she gets angry and walks off.

My sister and BIL have been married for 6 years and BIL has two children (17f, 16m) with his ex. The children's mother abandoned them during the divorce and my BIL has raised them since. My sister and BIL are not as financially secure as me and there's not a lot of money for my sister's stepchildren to attend college.

103,1ezbsll,AITA for kicking my brother out after he drove me 16 hours and helped me move?,"My brother helped me move for school - I don't drive, so he drove me and all my stuff 16 hours, and then he stayed with me for about a week. This was really nice of him, especially because he has to drive back alone. He helped me with errands, and took me and my roommates out.

He does party drugs and generally just drinks and smokes weed kind of a lot, but whatever he's an adult he can make his own choices. My roommates were fine with this. i'm comparatively very straight edge - i drink sometimes and don't really smoke.

My brother said he was gonna leave around the end of the week, and the day before he was going to he took acid and was out in the sun for like 5+ hours and got pretty sunburnt. He came back to my place and was showing me how to cook something, acting erratic and drinking. He made a huge mess of the kitchen, and I was running around trying to clean up after him, but I had already been out doing school stuff and I was exhausted. I asked him if he could clean up the rest and he said sure.

I went to my room and then like an hour later my roommate knocked on my door because my brother had fallen asleep and not cleaned up. She was really nice and helped me clean up while I was apologizing.

I was really upset and texted my brother that he needed to be gone by 3pm the next day or could stay one more night, but he had to leave in the morning and had to stay sober. I also texted one of his friends, gave him brief details, and asked him to check in on him for the ride back home.

I can't tell if he's genuinely annoyed and mad or if he's just tired, but he definitely thinks I'm being unreasonable for asking him to leave.

This is kind of the last straw, because we left for the drive an entire day later than I had asked him to (I literally accounted for this - it's a 2-3 day drive and I asked if we could leave 5 days before).

104,1ezbptk,AITA for lying to my boyfriend about baby biscuits?,"My boyfriend (24/M) and I (25/F) have been together for almost a year. We come from different countries and types of families, and so there have been instances of us misunderstanding one another, but no matter the hardships we've always found strength in working through our faults to make each other happy. Our arguments, although only happened a few times, did not last long as we always mindfully communicated. That was until recently.

Now, I have had insecurities about my physical appearance throughout my  life - crooked teeth, saggy breasts, cellulite, and worst of all - heavy weight. I was bullied at school and made fun of at my own home because of it. This made my relationship with food very unhealthy and I am aware of it. I like to binge on everything sweet if there is any, and that morning I woke up to make myself a bowl of baby food.

In this country, there is a popular brand of baby biscuits called ""gigibebe"" which, once mixed with milk, is given to little kids as a form of nutritious porridge. Adults love this stuff too, including me and my boyfriend.  We always kept a box of baby biscuits in our cabinets, and when there was nothing to eat we would always make ourselves some baby food. When I looked inside the box that day I saw that there was just enough biscuits to make one bowl of sweet deliciousness. So I ate what remained and got to do my chores for the day.

When my boyfriend got up he wanted us to have some breakfast. I said that I was not hungry, but if he wanted I could make him some eggs with tomatoes. He said that since there was no bread to go with it that he would like to eat some baby food instead. When he opened the cabinet and saw no baby biscuit package he asked me if I ate it all. At that moment I felt really bad about the deal, but since I did not want to look like a glutton, I lied and told him that I threw the box away as it seemed empty. And that was my biggest mistake.

He knew how much was left, as he got to eat half of that package at night, and so me telling him that it was empty set him off. He asked me several times if I was being honest, but I kept pushing my point until he stood up and got out of the house. Upon return, he threw the empty package of baby biscuits in front of me, which he got from rummaging in our communal trash bin. He called me names, said that the little faith he had in me is now gone, and that if I was stupid enough to lie about such a minor thing that there is no way to trust me. He then told me to start packing up to move out of the house we just moved into.

I do not know what to do with myself. I feel shame and guilt over lying about something so trivial. I truly believe that if a person cares about someone they can change their ways. I am willing to do so, and I said that to him, but he refused to accept anything from me.

At that moment I felt really bad about the deal, but since I did not want to look like a glutton, I lied and told him that I threw the box away as it seemed empty. And that was my biggest mistake.

He knew how much was left, as he got to eat half of that package at night, and so me telling him that it was empty set him off. He asked me several times if I was being honest, but I kept pushing my point until he stood up and got out of the house. Upon return, he threw the empty package of baby biscuits in front of me, which he got from rummaging in our communal trash bin. He called me names, said that the little faith he had in me is now gone, and that if I was stupid enough to lie about such a minor thing that there is no way to trust me. He then told me to start packing up to move out of the house we just moved into.

I do not know what to do with myself. I feel shame and guilt over lying about something so trivial. I truly believe that if a person cares about someone they can change their ways. I am willing to do so, and I said that to him, but he refused to accept anything from me. So, did I act as an a-hole by lying about not eating baby biscuits, or is he simply exaggerating?",1.0,0.1255933791399002,0,0

I want to note that we are all under 18 and therefore there was no legal intervention, and the game was published on the Internet, not sold.

I was a member of a development team of 3 people.
The game owner and i were good friends 
for 2.5 years. We had 2 games, and he decided to make a 3rd one.
The first game contained songs that i made, which however, weren't made specifically for the game, and are released as songs on their own.
The songs are NOT bound to the game, i just gave the permission to use them in the first game. One day he decided on himself without asking that he is gonna use the old songs in the new game. I told him that I've improved and therefore don't wish for the old songs to be in the game. However, he didn't take no as an answer and started getting very mad. Even though I've made a soundtrack specifically for the second game, he wouldn't accept that. His excuse was that he asked me nicely many times and then got mad because ""if i tell you to do something you will do it"". Yes, i would've accepted it if they were ORIGINAL songs for the first game, but they're just random songs. Fast forward he made a drama about it, fired me, the other developer left and he told the server the whole story in an announcement, also adding that apparently I've been playing witcher instead of working (which was the case, because i was on vacation somewhere else with only my laptop). We were an amateur group, not a big game studio.
And i did not want the songs because i didn't want people to hear my old work, which was average at best.
Am i the asshole?

The record label that my band has recently gotten into a scandal and as a result, the upper management has been restructured and the executives have been replaced with newer faces. As a result, the company has been very eager to repair their reputation and reached out to my band with a proposal where we pretend that S and I are fighting with H and J to gather more attention from fans. 

Now S, J and I were eager to execute this plan but H refused because she sees the band as her family and didn’t want us to fight. I was aware that she had a complicated relationship with her family who emotionally neglected her for almost her entire life and preferred her older brother over her which was why she came to see us as her family and why she became a sort of overprotective older sibling figure to the band. S explained to her that it was necessary for us to compete as we couldn’t risk losing future opportunities but she still refused then ran off crying, with J following after her to comfort her. 

It turns out that H was completely boycotting any work related to the project and this meant that J had to manage everything and smooth things out for our employers. It hurt me to see her this upset so I asked S what to do and he came up with a plan where we organise a meeting without her but I felt it wasn’t very nice to leave her out so I invited her. 

On the day of the meeting, H started insulting me and saying I’m nothing more than S’ doll that he controls as well as still denying participating. I knew there was no other way to resolve this so I decided to pretend to be mad at her. I snapped at her and said I was disappointed in her for not following my orders and threatened to kick her out of the band if she continued being unprofessional and abandoning her duties. H was shocked at this and swiftly left without saying a word but she ended up cooperating. 

I never intended to actually kick her out and was going to tell her the truth when the event ended. However, S keeps on yelling at me and claimed I ruined everything because he was going to pretend to fulfill her demands and guilt trip her into participating but I didn’t want him to control her and called him out for stepping out of line. J was also complaining about how overworked he was now and H is no longer talking to me. I also feel bad for hurting her feelings because I’ve never seen her this upset even though the threat wasn’t real.

109,1ezb5hh,AITA for not inviting my parents to my fiancé's birthday party?,"Last weekend my fiance (Emma 26F) had a birthday party at our house, it was a small garden party and BBQ with close friends and family. 

Backstory: My parents are kinda assholes. They complain about food in restaurants, like arguing with strangers, and request refunds on like everything they buy. My girlfriends parents are kinda similar. 
I love Emma, she is the love of my life. We had a son (Theo 1M) a year ago. We met 4 years ago, and started dating soon after.

And ""I hardly see Theo anymore, dont you want him to see his grandparents?"" Their argument was that if my brother could come why couldn't they.

110,1ezb5bn,AITA for fighting with my friend because he refused to perform with me?,"I (M15) am part of a musical school club with four other people. Since we go to an art school & two of our club members (both M17) were seniors, I thought that it would be a good idea for me & the other two club members (both M15 as well) to thank them for all of their hard work forming the club by performing a song for them in the school venue as celebration.

I brought this idea up with the two other club members at school. One of them (Shane) was happy with this idea, but the other club member (Mike) complained & said he didn’t want to do it as it was too much work. Mike is sort of a pessimist & complains all the time. I’m okay with how he acts, but it pissed me off at how he wasn’t even willing to do this simple act.

(For further info, Mike only joined the club because one of our seniors (Charlie) pushed him to do it. He was kind of a pushover and tried motivating all of us to do our best, but Mike still stayed either way thanks to him)

I went to Mike’s house because I really wanted to do this idea and convince him. His response was the same. He didn’t want to do it.

This is where I think I messed up because I snapped at him. We got into a verbal fight. I started yelling at him saying that he was ungrateful & a brat for constantly complaining about not wanting to perform despite the kindness our seniors gave us by making this club and inviting him in the first place.

In the end though, I just wanted to know why Mike felt this way. I thought he was really good at singing & so did everyone in the club too. I told him that he should’ve quit and leave us if he was just gonna continue complaining about performing in the first place.

Mike started crying & explained his side. He works part time at a local greengrocer his family owns. The club members already knew about this though. He said he was going to focus on helping his family instead of participating in the club.

He then started explaining how in middle school, people would try befriending him because of his looks only to drop him because they thought he was boring. He thought we were gonna do the same to him, which is why he wasn’t motivated to perform the idea I had in the first place. He felt like he was unworthy of performing & didn’t deserve to pursue it.

I think it gets more complicated. The reason why Mike feels obligated to work with his family instead of performing with us is because his brother wants to become a lawyer but he keeps failing his exams despite his effort. Mike said he wants to support his brother’s dream by taking over the business so he doesn’t have to worry about it. However, he’s abandoning music & us in the process.

He regrets being pessimistic & wishes he could perform with us, but due to his family issues and his own self esteem, he doesn’t want to do it.

This happened yesterday. I feel really bad for yelling at him & I think I went too far.

The people at my sister's school who opened the car doors stopped opening our car door because of how loud the music was. 

So the issue comes up when I asked him to pause the music when I get out of the car. He got really mad and screamed at me about not liking my culture and being ashamed of it. And he refused to turn it off or lower it and actually increased it a little. I had to wait for the song to end and then I quickly ran out of the car after already grabbing my backpack and stuff.

I feel like I might be the asshole cuz it is kind because it's Indian music but even if he played ""American"" music at that volume I'd ask him to pause it when I got out of the car. I just don't want to get out of the car with blasting music cuz it's so embarrassing. And I think he knows it because last year when we carpooled with 1, then 2, then 3 other people he never played his music in the car and all of them were Indian and knew those songs.

Anyways now I'm going into 9th grade and I'm going to go on the bus or maybe on a bicycle to wake up later but the thing is that my dad might still drop me off at school on some days (not more than once or twice a year because he hates carpool).

112,1ezatjk,AITA for thinking my boyfriend’s mum has a weird relationship with him?,"i’m only going to explain this one situation that occurred in order to keep it short and sweet. but there are a couple of others on a similar level of ambiguity. 

Basically, me and my boyfriend had our one year anniversary celebrations a few days ago. we had lots planned, a super lovely restaurant and a beautiful cocktail bar. The same day of our plans, he gets a call from his mum, he leaves the room for the call and then comes back in crying his eyes out. 

he told me his dog’s dying and she’s being put down the next day at 1:30 PM, she was asking him if he could come home. i was obviously very upset for him, hugged him, held him, and told him it’s okay if he wants to go home. he didn’t want to, he said if it wasn’t such an important day for us then he would have. so anyway, he said he didn’t wanna ruin the day for us so he bottled it all inside and said he’ll mourn when he gets home. 

Next day rolls around, turns out, his dog wasn’t dying, in fact she wasn’t even close. she just fell over and couldn’t get back up, so they took her to the vets and she has osteoarthritis but is otherwise in a perfectly healthy condition (old dog). 

upon hearing this, i was obviously relieved, but later on, starting questioning some stuff. why on earth would you ring your son on arguably one of the most important days of his and my life, asking if he can come home, for a dog that you don’t even know is actually dying yet. i asked him this, and he said that she just assumed the worst and that he would do the same. but i truly don’t think he would, i know this man and whenever a terrible situation has occurred, he never has assumed the worst, he will always start by looking for answers and solutions before going “oh she cant get up after falling over, definitely dying!” 

i started asking him about the vet process. where did his mum get the whole “scheduled to be put down at 1:30” from? did the vets tell her that? if so, when did they change their mind and realise it wasn’t as serious as they thought? i have completely forgot the answers he gave to these questions now.

i expressed my dissatisfaction with her behaviour to him, and he didn’t agree but he said he definelty would have been angry at her if he did end up going home just to find out he dropped all of our plans for nothing. i just told him that if similar things start occurring on important days for us, i’ll be very annoyed. i’m aware it wasn’t a complete lie, but the exaggeration was crazy.

Now this is why I was annoyed, I have been a vegetarian now for 8 years and my friend knew this.

I want to know if I'm the a-hole here.

116,1eza8l9,AITA for trying to comfort my co-worker but ending up making him upset ? ,"The other day, I (23F) was chatting with my co-worker (26M). One topic came after another, our conversation got deeper, and then he shared something very personal with me. He said when he was 20 he had a car accident which left him paraplegic for a couple of months. He was afraid he couldn’t ever walk again and was severely depressed. 

This was his first time opening up about this. I was surprised and felt deeply for him, and I wanted to show him my sympathies. I said “I’m so sorry. It must have been so hard for you, I mean going through something like that, especially when you are already struggling so much. I can’t even imagine what it felt like. It must be horrible. But I’m glad you are recovered now.” I stroked his shoulder and told him I was proud of him.

He thanked me but asked what I mean by “when you are already struggling so much”. I was taken aback by his question. For context he is deaf , so obviously that was what I meant by struggling so much. I told him I didn’t mean anything bad, I just wanted to empathize with him and how hard going through that must have been for him as a hearing impaired person. He said he’s not hearing impaired, he’s deaf. It’s not a bad word and I can just say that. He doesn’t view his deafness as something bad, he was born this way and very proud of it. Being deaf didn’t make that accident any harder to go through than it would have been. 

In response I just said “oh okay, i see” I could tell he was waiting for an apology, because he seemed visibly upset, and the conversation just ended there, so I excused myself shortly after. I don’t think I had to apologize for what I said. I don’t want to sound judgmental, but I feel like he was being way too sensitive. He fixated on such a small thing I said and scolded me for it when all I was doing was trying to comfort him. To be honest, all that I’m so proud talk came across a little performative to me, especially with him having cochlear implants, no shade but it felt hypocritical. 

He was acting cold towards me since that day, and yesterday he finally told me he thinks I behaved inappropriately and was rude towards him, which I find confusing because I felt like he was the one being rude to me. AITA?

This is one wedding that we have been preparing for over a year now and we could not be more excited about it.

In this regard, it is possible to underline that my family is rather complicated. My brother has a child with his baby mama whom I will refer to as “Sharron” (24 years female). These two lovers separated after their child was born acrimoniously two years ago. Now my brother and Sharron are in speaking terms because they have to be for the sake of the kids but they are not close buddies. Well, I surely know that they are no longer an item, and my brother has gone further to find another girlfriend.

Okay, here comes the contrary. My mom (56) has developed an obsessive-relationship-love with Sharron, in which she often acts as if they are still a couple. My mom still persistently invites Sharron to events, even with my brother’s new girlfriend around. Seriously, it is just so embarrassing, and my brother despises it though he hardly ever voices out his opinion just to avoid the creation of issue.

Of course now that my wedding is closer my mom is telling me I have to invite Sharron because well “she is practically family” and “it would be nice for her to feel some morale. ” I have no issue with Sharron herself, but we are not friends, have never been close and don’t see each other on a regular basis, neither is she close to my fiancée and honestly I don’t feel like she should come to our wedding

To add to this mess, a distant uncle (65M), with whom I don't normally see eye to eye with, but who loves to meddle in family affairs, called me a few days ago and said that not inviting Sharron would be a breach of the ‘familial loyalty’ and I should ‘do the right thing’.

Fortunately, I have managed to hold my own till now, but now mom is talking about ‘breaking the family apart’ because I refused to invite Sharron. My own brother has refrained from making the comment because he doesn’t wish to ‘pay the price’. My fiancée applauds me for the decision I make but he does not wish that this issue should become part of his wedding show.

120,1ez9a4x,WIBTA if I didn’t share my meal prep with my dad??,"I (23AFAB) am married to my husband (24M) and we live with my dad (71M). Currently, I don’t have a job and we don’t pay bills or rent (not for a lack of asking tho). My husband is the only one working and we (my husband and I) are on a budget, my dad is retired ER doctor and on a fixed income. We grocery shop separately, the only real “bills” we share are the vet/ pet food bills (which is like pulling teeth to get my dad to help with).

My family has always been one to share everything if we had it because when I was a kid, we weren’t rich, but definitely weren’t struggling. My husband’s family was never like that, once they were old enough to get jobs, their mother basically told them it was on them if they didn’t want what she had and they never shared food or even ate together really.

My dad knew this information and gave me and my husband a singular cabinet in the house for me and him to put our food in (it’s really not as bad as it might sound, we still have access to a separate freezer and we can put stuff in the fridge lol cabinet is just for dry and canned stuff). BUT every night for a few months, he would sneak into our cabinet and eat our chips or cookies, and then blame the fact he “couldn’t go back to sleep unless he had some chips” as the reason he HAD to have my husband’s chips. On top of that he wouldn’t tell us for a few weeks until we either found it or he felt guilty enough to finally tell us. So, I no longer keep snacks in the house because of this. I have confronted him about this and he either guilted me into letting it go or got angry and shamed me until I got upset (I’m not good at confrontation, it makes me nervous).

Recently, I’ve been thinking of meal prepping to help me lose some weight and make better food choices, but I’m scared to do that. I’m worried about my dad getting into the food I’ve prepped for the week and not telling me until I see it, or guilting me until I relent and give him a meal, leaving me to have to buy extra food we dont have the budget for. I love my dad, but I really hate being the family doormat because everyone in the family knows I’ll relent either way.

So, WIBTA??

Edit: I will say, I think I’m being a jerk and I will communicate more!

I will say, I do resent of the “you’re a freeloader” comments. I do some laundry (split with my dad), I take care of the animals, I take the animals the vet, I take my dad to doctors appointments when I can, I go to school full time, I make the budget for me and my husband. The only thing I don’t really do is clean, but that’s because we have a friend that comes to clean once every two weeks, so I just keep up with what she does. And I cook for me and my dad when he doesn’t want too.

I’m sorry I haven’t been able to find a job yet 🙄

Edit 2: I get it, I’m selfish and deserve to be kicked out.

I (23AFAB) am married to my husband (24M) and we live with my dad (71M). Currently, I don’t have a job and we don’t pay bills or rent (not for a lack of asking tho). My husband is the only one working and we (my husband and I) are on a budget, my dad is retired ER doctor and on a fixed income. We grocery shop separately, the only real “bills” we share are the vet/ pet food bills (which is like pulling teeth to get my dad to help with).

My family has always been one to share everything if we had it because when I was a kid, we weren’t rich, but definitely weren’t struggling. My husband’s family was never like that, once they were old enough to get jobs, their mother basically told them it was on them if they didn’t want what she had and they never shared food or even ate together really.

My dad knew this information and gave me and my husband a singular cabinet in the house for me and him to put our food in (it’s really not as bad as it might sound, we still have access to a separate freezer and we can put stuff in the fridge lol cabinet is just for dry and canned stuff). BUT every night for a few months, he would sneak into our cabinet and eat our chips or cookies, and then blame the fact he “couldn’t go back to sleep unless he had some chips” as the reason he HAD to have my husband’s chips. On top of that he wouldn’t tell us for a few weeks until we either found it or he felt guilty enough to finally tell us. So, I no longer keep snacks in the house because of this. I have confronted him about this and he either guilted me into letting it go or got angry and shamed me until I got upset (I’m not good at confrontation, it makes me nervous).

Recently, I’ve been thinking of meal prepping to help me lose some weight and make better food choices, but I’m scared to do that. I’m worried about my dad getting into the food I’ve prepped for the week and not telling me until I see it, or guilting me until I relent and give him a meal, leaving me to have to buy extra food we dont have the budget for. I love my dad, but I really hate being the family doormat because everyone in the family knows I’ll relent either way.

So, WIBTA??

Edit: I will say, I think I’m being a jerk and I will communicate more!

I will say, I do resent of the “you’re a freeloader” comments. I do some laundry (split with my dad), I take care of the animals, I take the animals the vet, I take my dad to doctors appointments when I can, I go to school full time, I make the budget for me and my husband. The only thing I don’t really do is clean, but that’s because we have a friend that comes to clean once every two weeks, so I just keep up with what she does. And I cook for me and my dad when he doesn’t want too.

I’m sorry I haven’t been able to find a job yet 🙄

Edit 2: I get it, I’m selfish and deserve to be kicked out.

I don’t ask for him to fund my lifestyle, I ask for help every couple months because 3 cats and 2 dogs aren’t mine and he and my mom AGREED they shouldn’t have to be my responsibility before she moved out, i helped take care of those animals after some personal stuff between my mom and dad caused those animals to be neglected and before I had to quit my job (I had health stuff going on and have been out of work for 4 months, now I’m trying to find a job again)

121,1ez95pa,AITA for not letting my husband’s sister bring a friend to see our new puppy at our house ,"My husband’s sister privately messaged him about bringing a friend to see our new puppy at our house tomorrow(Friday). I found it a pattern for her to invite herself into our house with her friend/BF with the primary reason to check out our animals. So I got upset.

Background: 
I am an immigrant and my families are all in another country. We bought a house 30mins away from my husband’s family 2 years ago. Since then we would meet his sister and parent every week, once at our house, once at his family’s. The sister had some visits that crossed my personal boundaries:

1. A year ago she brought her BF to our house during a weekly meetup unannounced (we met him a couple times previously on other occasions).

2. Recently his sister got a new BF. After a couple month, she asked to come to our house with the BF. I feel awkward to let new people in our house so I suggested (my husband sent the msg) to meet at a restaurant more officially. But she said she “wants him to see the cats” (we have two cats, I adopted them when I was single 6 years back). I was overwhelmed by the situation but said yes for my husband.

3. Lately we got a puppy. Sister brought BF to our house on a weekly meetup because she wanted him to meet the puppy (she gave us advance notice).

4. Tonight my husband received a msg asking if it’s ok for the sister to bring a friend to our house to meet the puppy.

I may be overreacting. But here are my triggers:
1. as co-owner of the house, it should take both of us to consent on guest invitations. 
2. I am ok with the sister if she’s alone, but uncomfortable about hosting people I am not familiar with. Even though we might have met them in other places before.
3. 3 of these visits are for checking out the animals. I feel like with new people, it’s a bit disrespectful to ignore the host and primarily see the animals.

For these events, either we are not notified, or she sent the message to my husband directly (we do have a group chat). I am getting increasingly frustrated because my boundaries are not respected. Every time I complain to my husband, he would say she’s a family. He can’t reject seeing a family even though we have a planned meetup including the puppy in 2 days. Tonight my husband basically said he won’t ask for my consent, he just wants whoever he likes to come. He ignored my feelings and said my expectations are totally unreasonable. When we talk about how it’s unfair my families never gets to even meet us every week, my husband just said “they can come at any time” (as if they can just randomly pop up from the other side of the world). He thinks that shouldn’t impact the frequency of his family visiting him (despite the fact that some of these are his sister inviting herself over randomly with almost strangers in our house.)

It would have been nice if my husband stepped in earlier but he keeps avoiding the conflict and try to bully me to say yes to his families during this

She told me specifically about how I was the one who inspired her to start singing. I was surprised, but extremely happy that I was able to deliver some sort of hope to someone. 

Anyway, a couple of months ago, I noticed that M was falling into a slump (if that's the right word). I had a little conversation with her, and she told me about how much trouble she had with singing lately. I encouraged her to keep practicing, and that she'll get back to where she used to be in no time. M took my words and kept practicing day and night, which led to her injuring her vocal cords. When I visited her in the hospital, she lashed out at me for giving her false hope. She told me how I was a liar and how she wanted the time she spent practicing back to her. The band broke up shortly after. 

I feel horrible in every way, and I can't help but feel like this is all my fault. I feel like I took advantage of her and I can't forgive myself for that. AITA?.

A little refresher, Myself and my four biological sisters were abandoned due to the one-child policy and found each other later in life as well as our biological parents and a younger brother. Due to the way I was abandoned I had no interest in getting to know them but I agreed to a single zoom call to get some answers.

It has came to my attention my youngest bio-sister who is 22 and lives in Germany has been in regular contact with our bio-parents after the initial meeting and they offered her quite a bit of comfort after her longterm boyfriend cheated on her and that relationship fell apart. She has now revealed to us that she plans to go to Guangzhou in the near future to meet a man who our bio-parents wish her to meet as he is supposedly the son of their friend and our bio-parents are apparently paying for this entire trip for her. Our sisters are a bit hesitant about this but no one wants to tell her it's a stupid idea as they feel she's a grown woman and it's up to her. I tried to express concern but she would not hear it sold on the dreamy idea of meeting a handsome man from the Country of our birth.

I am worried about her and how badly this can go wrong, I also have my doubts about the validity of this situation as something seems incredibly off about it. So I reached out to her Adoptive Grandparents to let them know her plans and my concerns about this whole situation.

They were horrified by this as they had no idea and their immediate concerns was that this was a potentially dangerous situation, and they assured me they would handle this.

She has since reached out demanding to know why I got in contact with her grandparents as it was not my place and she can make these decisions for herself. I told her that she may want to wear rose tinted glasses when it comes to our biological parents but i'm not going to let her fly across the world to a likely dangerous situation to meet a man she's never even spoken to before which she told me if he was a creep she'd at least get a free Holiday out of it. 

We ended up arguing quite a bit over this with some heated words being exchanged. Our bio-sisters have told me I shouldn't have went behind her back like that and if it was a mistake she needed to learn from it herself but I worry she may not have had the chance to learn from it if it was a mistake. Meanwhile my Adoptive brothers have expressed relief i'm not that much of an idiot or else they'd have locked me in my room until that idea left my head.

125,1ez7ypd,AITA for not lending money to my sister to go out.,"My oldest sister is 29 years old, working as a teacher and getting minimum wage. I'm a 24F software engineer, and thus she relies on me lending her money to prepare for her wedding house. Till now, she's borrowed from me over the amount we've agreed upon, and I thought it's okay; she's my sister after all. Her fiancé isn't good with money either, and neither he nor his family seems to carry the same responsibility I'm carrying. This summer, they didn't do much with their part in preparing the wedding house; instead, they asked my sister if our family wanted to travel with them. She told him no, our family is not going to travel because we have responsibilities, and that his family isn't taking enough responsibility. We've mostly done our part (using my money lending her) and are now waiting for them to do their part in the house so we can continue, but instead of taking responsibility, they care about status and traveling.

Whenever she takes money from me, she writes it down and says she'll give it to me once we sell our dad's house. The money she owes so far has already passed her share in the house anyways, but I keep doing it because she's not done with her part of the marriage house. Now, my childhood friend was traveling, and I said I'm okay going with her. I also took my younger sister (13F) and cousin (13F) because that's how far my budget can go.

Yesterday, she wanted to go to the amusement park. They asked if I was coming, and I said no, I'm too tired to go after work. She, my younger sister, my cousin, and my older sister (27F, currently in a gap between jobs) agreed to go together. My eldest sister asked my elder sister to transfer her 4x the amount of money to buy the tickets. My older sister was surprised and said she didn't know she'd be paying for everyone and that this is a lot. She suggested they divide the amount, but she doesn't have money right now and will give it to her later, at the beginning of the next month when she gets paid. She still said no.

The oldest sister looked at me. I told her I only lend for essentials, not for going out and having fun. She said, ""But you're traveling and will spend a lot of money."" I said that's because I budgeted it; you can't suggest going out but then not know how you'll pay for it. ""You don't know how much money I have or how I plan to budget this month?"" She went silent. I asked mom for all the things I'll need to lend her for the rest of the month to prepare for her wedding house. I thought about it, then told her, ""Fine, I'll pay 2x for our younger sister and cousin, you pay x for yourself, and our older sister pays x for herself."" Our older sister said that the oldest doesn't even have the x to pay for herself. I said, ""Oh, so why did you suggest the amusement park when not even you can pay for it?

129,1ez6rip,AITA for telling my feelings to someone,"This happened back in January 2024, but I am still dealing with the fallout, most probably the guilt that I did something wrong even though my therapist told me I was in the clear. 

I am in a PhD program, and in my 1st year (July 2023), I met a girl who is very kind, educated, and doing a PhD in her field. She was very sweet and probably one of the best people I have encountered. We started off with friends, but as we met, I fell more in love with her as I hung out in the evening with her, etc., talking about our daily lives or professional lives. I noticed my feelings have been increasing a bit, and I know I fall in love because whenever I see her, her smile makes me feel such a bundle of joy. If there is anything in the world that is more beautiful than that, 

I decided to share my feelings in the month of January. I asked her out if we could go to some cafe, and once we reached there, I told her gently that I really had feelings for her. While we started off as friends, the way her personality was, her kindness—everything only increased my feelings for her, and little did I know that I started loving her. I had a fair bit of an idea that she was single, but I was honestly prepared for everything. She rejected me politely, saying she didn't want to be in relationship during her PhD and really wanted to continue being friends, to which I agreed and stated that if the feelings for me ever change, let me know (I know I am very, very stupid in telling this). I also gave her a letter, which sort of was prepared for both cases, saying that despite whatever happens, it was an honor meeting her and loving her, and I wish her so much happiness in life. I also gave her the gift that I brought for her on her birthday but forgot to give her on birthday because I was not in the city. 

We managed to salvage the friendship, but now the friendship was just text buddies and one or two meets. We exchanged happy friendships this August. I was largely able to move forward from it because, for me, I boxed myself into thinking that I was at fault and that I did something wrong and it was on me, so do better next time, until someone very close to me argued that, according to him, you did as well as one could, and although it was not perfect, you really are not at fault in this.

When the other underclassman that I am friends with, we’ll call him Shawn (M16) asked us if we are doing anything to repay our seniors, I kinda lost it.

I told Miles that even though everyone supported him all year, he only complained like a spoiled brat. Here is where I could be the asshole, I got pretty nasty in the argument. I yelled at him that he is spineless wimp and that he should’ve left and disappeared before he ate up Charlie’s last year of High School.

135,1ez56jd,AITA for letting my jealousy create more problems?,"I, 18 female have been dating my boyfriend, 21 male for 8 months.

We started dating, around xmas, his girl bff had a xmas party with her family 1 hour away from where we were, she didn’t have money. She asked him for a lift to go to that family party instead of him paying for her gas. He ditched me that night for her.

I'm often invited with my bf and his friends but never with her. They went walking to the park I often go with my bf to just walk and talk, to me it felt like that park was our place but when I told him, he started asking if wherever we go together he can't go with anyone else.

She also calls him weekly for like 20 mins. Her favorite phone call subject is the boys that she likes that week. To me it feels like she's trying to make him jealous?

3 weeks ago, my bf planned a bday party for himself but I wanted to make him a surprise party too so I planned one for the week after. I made a groupchat, I added his girl bff in it. She DMed me, saying that she was making him a cake for his bday but now she felt like she had 2 cakes to make for that second party I planned, I told her that she didn’t need to cause I already had one planned. As his friend, she has no obligation to make him a cake anyway and I'm the one that should feel that responsibility. I talked about it with my bf and he laughed at my face.

Last week was that party, she showed up with a cake, I had spent 100$ getting a beautiful Harley Davidson cake done for him and she came with a cake.

The other problems: months ago, I've noticed he's been putting less effort into our relationship, for like a month we hadn't gone on a date, saw eachother a lot less, he practically stopped answering my messages... I asked if it was that much to take a 10s in a day just to answer my messages cause he would leave me on delivered for 15-20 hrs. According to him, if he calls me, he doesn't need to open my messages but I don't go over what I've texted him or the tiktoks I sent him when we're on a call so my questions and messages are left unanswered.

Even when we make plans, he cancels me last second to go with friends, we can barely get 1 afternoon alone, we practically see eachother only on weekends but always with others. I feel like a friend to him. Recently we were supposed to spend the night just us, but his friend called him to go eat dinner, since we hadn't seen eachother all week he invited me too, we then ended up having a small gathering. He usually cancels me to go with his friends. His excuse if often, we've seen eachother all weekend so we don't need to see eachother for a while.

We started dating, around xmas, his girl bff had a xmas party with her family 1 hour away from where we were, she didn’t have money. She asked him for a lift to go to that family party instead of him paying for her gas. He ditched me that night for her.

I'm often invited with my bf and his friends but never with her. They went walking to the park I often go with my bf to just walk and talk, to me it felt like that park was our place but when I told him, he started asking if wherever we go together he can't go with anyone else.

She also calls him weekly for like 20 mins. Her favorite phone call subject is the boys that she likes that week. To me it feels like she's trying to make him jealous?

136,1ez4x62,AITA for not leaving a concert to escort my sick friend home?,"Last month, one of my best friends (24F) and I (24F) went to see the Joe Hisaishi Symphonic Concert at Madison Square Garden in NYC. I was incredibly excited. As a classical musician and as someone who grew up watching the Studio Ghibli movies, I was fully prepared to be reduced to tears during this concert. Tickets were not cheap, but the concert was right after my birthday so I decided to treat myself. I asked my best friend from college, a fellow Ghibli fan and New York resident, if she'd like to come with me and she agreed excitedly.

The morning of the concert, she tells me she feels sick, but she goes to the concert anyway. And what a concert it was! I'm captivated by Hisaishi's conducting and the musicians' performance. We're having a great time. Or at least I was. Halfway through the concert, my friend gets up from her seat and leaves. She texts me from the bathroom in a panic, saying she can't breathe and needs to go home. She says she can go by herself but feels bad leaving me behind. I go out and meet her and she's really upset, but breathing. She's adamant on going home, so I don't try to convince her to stay. She leaves pretty quickly.

The rest of the concert is amazing, of course, but it's a bit lonely. I record her favorite pieces and send them to her immediately so she can watch them almost in real-time. She doesn't reply to the videos I sent, but updates me that she returned home safely. Later, I take the LIRR back and go home.

Yesterday, over a month after the concert, she sends me a long text saying that she was very hurt that I didn't leave with her. She felt unsafe and alone on the way back, and she tells me that she doesn't want to be friends with someone who wouldn't consider making sure she got home safe. 

I reply back saying I'm sorry I made her feel that way, but I had no idea she felt that way. In my mind, her way back home was so safe that I hadn’t even considered she would feel unsafe. MSG is literally right above Penn Station. All she had to do to reach her train, the LIRR, was go downstairs. She wouldn't be wandering the city streets or anything; she didn’t even have to go outside. And the LIRR is cleaner and safer than most of NYC; people don't really question their safety on the LIRR, unlike the NYC subway. Not only that, her dad would pick her up from her stop, so she had someone waiting for her.

But regardless of what I consider to be safe or not, I would've left the concert in a heartbeat if she had just *asked*. I mean, she was clearly very upset before she left the concert, but I figured she was sad about missing half of the performance.

Honestly, I'm a little hurt that she stewed on this issue for over a month, and after all that thinking, came to the conclusion that I am not considerate or safe and our 5-year friendship must end. But I do feel bad that she felt so unsafe and lonely on her way back home, so I'm wondering if I'm at fault here.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-23,"AITA for not leaving a concert to escort my sick friend home?

It started with Key continuously posting a picture of myself that I didn't really like, then Ashley and Dan saved it and started doing the same thing, laughing at me.

The rest of the day was just them making jokes with me as the butt of every single one. Making fun of my name, things I've said, pictures of me. It was kinda annoying.

Everything I did would be used for a joke. I would say something, and Dan would just quote the thing I said with an unflattering meme or image, followed by everyone (besides Jay) laughing at me.

Ashley would say something to make fun of me, then delete it before anyone else saw it, and then I would say something back to her and Jay would suddenly get online as I said it and come to her side immediately.

140,1ez48mi,WIBTA for last minute refusing to go to my future SILs bachelorette party?,"Hey all

I want someone else’s opinion because I’m kind of torn on this. It’s hopefully not going to be some long winded post, since I really don’t have too much to write. 

So basically, I (21NB) was invited a month ago to my SILs bachelorette party. This party was originally supposed to be a nail salon, a restaurant and then a small party at home- but turned into a lipstick creation lab, a pizza restaurant and bar, but keeping the small part at home. I wasn’t told the cost of things beforehand snd assumed that the lipstick thing wouldn’t cost more than $40. Regardless I was never quoted a price. 

I’m someone who doesn’t like lipstick. I don’t use it. I never have, I made that clear to my sister (who arranged it all) and mom, both over the years and when I was told this. I also do not like cheese, nor do I like most pasta or sauces and this pizza place doesn’t seem like something I’d enjoy because of this- and is extremely expensive on top of that. I researched the restaurant and figured I’d spend the money anyways to make my SIL happy, before knowing the cost of the lipstick lab…

… I was verbally invited a month ago, but only two days ago was I given the proper invitation with a location. The price wasn’t even quoted on there. I was told on the train today by my mother that the lipstick making place was $75; and then when I looked online, it was going to actually come to $95+tax with the fees and all. And on top of that, I’d then have to pay for food (which I already agreed to / assumed so this part is not the problem, if more just means the final cost goes up by a lot). So this would all run me about $150

I literally start college in two weeks and need to spend money on a new laptop that works properly, a new bag, supplies etc. and was not told about the cost of things until the last minute. I want to cancel and say that I’m not going, but I also feel like despite the fact that I didn’t know sooner, I’d still be in the wrong as I didn’t give prior notice. And the invitation was supposed to be sent a while ago too, I never received it due to a mistyped number on my sisters end. 

I feel like I’ll end up being or looking like an asshole, and I also feel like it’s possible I’m just being cheap unintentionally. I’d rather have my SILs day be good than not and I don’t want to be an asshole and ruin that by not showing up- especially knowing it’s only 4 people including me attending. It wouldn’t be fair on her at all but I also just really don’t want to spend essentially $100 on lipstick I’m not ever going to use or like… 

UPDATE:

I decided to message not to go to the restaurant and lipstick lab but offered to still go to grandmas house after. Unfortunately for me, the train was cancelled and that’s the only timely route so my mom and sister told me to not come anymore as I’d be arriving 10 minutes before the party ended. I did take pics of the cancellation though because I really didn’t want them to think Im bsing 

Also my soon to be SIL is not good with technology, my sisters the one who was sending out the invites, not her. My sister has a huge dislike for me so it doesn’t shock me if she intended this either but I can’t speak to that, but please don’t blame my soon to be SIL- she’s genuinely very kind ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-23,"WIBTA for last minute refusing to go to my future SILs bachelorette party?

141,1ez46ak,AITA for eating my brother's leftovers?,"This may be ridiculous.

Yesterday night, my mother bought our weekly Chinese takeout dinner. My brother (M28) and I (F24) used to be obsessively fight about getting equal servings when we were minors. We started doing that less as we grew older.

Mom plated my food. While I ate and watched TV, my dad came home, changed, and went to get his food. He asked if my brother had eaten since he wanted extra. I said no and suggested he check with my brother. My brother said it was fine since he wasn’t eating his at all.

This evening, I decided to eat half of the leftover takeout. My mother said not to eat it, but I argued that my brother wasn’t going to eat it. She said she’d ask him when he got back. When he returned, he asked, “Why would you eat my food?” I replied, “I didn’t know you were going to eat it. You told Dad yesterday you weren’t eating your Chinese.” He retorted, “I never said that. I only said I wasn’t eating it last night.” We debated for a bit before I suggested, “Maybe it was just a miscommunication,” but he started yelling. I lost my temper when he scolded, “You should’ve used your common sense and assumed I’d want to eat it,” while pointing at his head.


""I did use my common sense to deduce you didn't want your leftovers because dad literally asked you if you wanted your Chinese food because he wanted to take extra,"" I argued. My mom yelled for us to stop, making it worse. We rudely told her to stop interrupting. Next, my brother asked me to stop interrupting him. I remember interrupting him once and him asking again that I stop. I listened. He interruptted his diatribe twice to accuse me of interrupting him by just making faces. I denied interrupting him which made him more angry. My mother again tried to get us to stop fighting. He fumed, ""The women in this house are crazy! I can't even finish speaking!"" Then, my brother kept talking about ""using common sense"" while he looked in the fridge. He clamed down a bit when he saw the size of the leftovers.


I asked him if he could make it more clear next time that he was going to eat the food the next day which prompted him to go on about ""common sense"" again. I retaliated with, ""You don't have enough common sense to make it clear you're going to eat the Chinese the next day."" He ran up to me to say, ""What did you say? I'm older than you. Don't disrespect me again!"" My mom tried to pull him back. I responded with a chuckle, ""I don't care how old you are, don't say I'm not using common sense!"" He proceeded to threaten me which didn't scare me. That's when my mom started getting between us. I repeated that I didn't care and not to disrespect me either. My brother claimed that because of how argumentative I am no man would ever marry me. I retorted with, ""I'd rather not being married than to be married to someone who disrespects me."" My brother stormed off to one living room and I stormed off to the other.

Later, my mom told me that she shouldn't have asked him about the leftovers.

AITA?",Everyone Sucks,2024-08-23,"AITA for eating my brother's leftovers? This may be ridiculous.

Yesterday night, my mother bought our weekly Chinese takeout dinner. My brother (M28) and I (F24) used to be obsessively fight about getting equal servings when we were minors. We started doing that less as we grew older.

Mom plated my food. While I ate and watched TV, my dad came home, changed, and went to get his food. He asked if my brother had eaten since he wanted extra. I said no and suggested he check with my brother. My brother said it was fine since he wasn’t eating his at all.

This evening, I decided to eat half of the leftover takeout. My mother said not to eat it, but I argued that my brother wasn’t going to eat it. She said she’d ask him when he got back. When he returned, he asked, “Why would you eat my food?” I replied, “I didn’t know you were going to eat it. You told Dad yesterday you weren’t eating your Chinese.” He retorted, “I never said that. I only said I wasn’t eating it last night.” We debated for a bit before I suggested, “Maybe it was just a miscommunication,” but he started yelling. I lost my temper when he scolded, “You should’ve used your common sense and assumed I’d want to eat it,” while pointing at his head.

While I was working out, they asked me if I wanted In-N-Out and I told them no that I would get it for myself later. They left to go get their food and about an 1-1.5 hours later, I leave to go to get my food. After ordering my food and now waiting in the drive through lane, I got rear-ended.

I hanged up, get my food, and park in the parking lot and began my call with my insurance. My mother and brother had got in their car and arrived at the same In-N-Out and they are talking with the guy now that had rear-ended me. After I am finished with my call, my mother and brother follow me home. 

The both of them continue to call me names and say that the accident is my fault and it could have been prevented if I would have just let them get me my food. They are both upset because that the vehicle has now been involved in 3 accidents where all 3 times I was not at fault; a hit and run that wrecked the bumper, an underage kid speeding and causing a 5 car collision, and now this rear-end. The first two accidents caused a combined nearly $20k in damages.

143,1ez4149,AITA for grounding my 11 year old for talking back to her mother when she had a legitimate reason to be upset ,"I (40m) have an 11 year old NT daughter and an 8 year old nonverbal daughter with high needs autism. 

My daughter is starting 6th grade and her class is due to go on a field trip next month; my wife agreed to go. However we just found out today that my ND daughter will be having an apple festival at school on the same day that NT daughter is having a trip. 

I cannot make either one as I am unable to get out of work I tried to switch shifts and no one else available we recently had two people quit and are extemely short staffed right now,  plus both girls want mom.

Anyway our ND would not be able to understand her mother's absence at this event she would just be wondering ""where's mom?"" And then become inconsolable because she'll be confused and not understand when all her other classmates have their parents there, she is developmentally like a toddler even though she's physically 8 years old.  

I know it's so unfair to our 11 year old but our 8 yo daughter is literally incapable of understanding moms absence when all her classmates have their parents there, and 11yo is capable of understanding.  

Long story short she stormed off to her room her mother tried to gently explain to her so she'd understand how it's an impossible situation that's no one's fault and she has no choice; 11 yo yelled ""screw you!"" And slammed the door. 

Wife told me what happened when I got home from work; I told her we completely understand why she's upset and she got the short end of the stick, but this is the way it has to be as much as sucks for us all and it's not okay to say ""screw you"" to her mother and slam doors. Normally we would've grounded her for two weeks but because of the circumstances we only grounded her for one week. 

My mother says we shouldn't have grounded her at all (my mother is biased she doesn't like m wife because I married outside our faith), I said she needs to be taught she cannot disrespect her parents like that.

144,1ez40qd,AITA for not stealing back my friend’s tv monitor? ,"My friend, who we’ll call Denise (20F), and I (21M) were running an event together where we needed the use of her expensive TV monitor. After we were done using it the monitor was stored at the house where the event took place. 

The day after the event the owners of the house asked us to come pick our shit up, so Denise tasked me with picking up all of our stuff that had so far been stored at this location, including her monitor, and place it somewhere else. She did remind to make sure she got back her monitor as it was very expensive and she didn’t have the means to replace it. However, for some unspecified reasons she wasn’t willing to actually help me pick up our stuff. Now, I do suspect entitlement on her part since she believed she’d already done so much more work than me on the event that she didn’t need to do the part where we picked our items from the house. 

Since I don’t have a car and there was a lot more stuff at that place than just the monitor I asked another one of my friends, who we’ll call Mike (20M), with help picking everything up. Mike had another event where he could conveniently use the TV monitor as well as all the other things we had brought for our event. He asked Denise for permission and she said yes. So, Mike helped me load everything up into his truck and then just use it himself. 

Mike was a member of the school’s football team, and so was I. Denise was a member of the girl’s soccer team. So when Mike was done using the monitor he simply stored it at a shed both teams use to store equipment in. Later that day Denise asked me where I had placed the monitor and I responded that it was stored at the shed by Mike, and that she could just go and pick it up any time. She thanked me and then we left for summer break. 

Fast forward like a month later, right in the middle of my summer break when I wasn’t even in the country by the way, and I get an angry text from Denise demanding to know where the fuck I had left her TV monitor. I simply responded that it was stored at the shed like a month ago and that that’s the last I had seen of it. 

She then goes on a rant about how it wasn’t there any more and how it was my fault that it was lost. I told her it was her fault that she didn’t get it as soon as I told her where I was, but she wasn’t having it. 

Apparently the tv monitor was stolen by a teammate who also belonged to a frat. Denise now wants me to come with her to their frat house and steal it back. I told her I wasn’t willing to do that.

He said that the look I gave him told him that “Once again he was choosing fantasy/his friends  over his family” (story for a different day perhaps)  I told him “the look was nothing like that in fact it was a look of ‘your choice’ because you know what’s been on the calendar, it doesn’t matter to me that your event was cancelled earlier in the month. I had nothing to do with that.” The conversation then turned to one about fairness because I attended both events I had planned this month and both of his were cancelled by the host. I turned the conversation back to the actual situation and told him that if he can’t do the entire weekend with me then he’s not going to the concert…. He then proceeded to freak out on me saying that I get to have all the fun. I think it’s the principle of the situation, these plans have been on the calendar longer than the plans he presented.  (The calendar was created due to his forgetfulness of events might I add.) 

I would also like to add when his events were on the calendar I had no problem with him attending these events, he worked out the child care so they could happen (they were both on a weekend) so there was no protest from me. I was sorry for him when he told me they were cancelled. 

AITA? ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-23,"AITA for giving my bf (25m) a choice between fantasy with his friends or a concert with me? Alright to give some back story my bf (25m) and I (22f) have been together 3 years.  I work S-T due to costs of child care (may not seem important now but it will come back up) my bf works a M-F regular 9-5.  Back in February I caught the presale of an artist both my bf and I enjoy (him more than I)  pretty close to the stage with a back stage experience included in the ticket.

151,1ez2uzg,WIBTA if I didn’t invite my best friend of 8 years to my halloween party?,"I, 15F, have had my best friend, Hannah (16F) since we were in the third grade. Once we got to high school, we ended up going to different schools. I ended up joining my schools drama club and becoming very good friends with majority of those people. Unfortunately, Hannah hasn’t gotten as lucky as I have with my friendships and doesn’t have really close friends at school like I do. Since Halloween is coming up, my mom wanted me to throw a halloween party so she could show off all her decorations. I figured it would be a fun idea to have a drama club halloween party since I live right by my school and it would be a lot of fun to have so many of my close friends there from drama club, and for everyone there to know each other better. I posted a joke saying “me when i throw my drama club halloween party (jk) (maybe not…)” to kind of tease it since there is nothing official about this party. She slid up with a sad face and I just responded “LOL might make exceptions” to not put anything concrete. Anyway, time is coming to start planning for when I want the party and who I want to invite, and I’m realizing I don’t know if I want her there. I love her, but she won’t know anyone but me, and her humor and personality doesn’t match my other friends very well.

153,1ez2jq0,AITA for not forgiving my little sister for wearing my dress?,"TL;DR: My sister wore a special dress of mine (that I could no longer wear) and only apologized when she knew how special it was to me, even though I had asked her not to wear it.

My little sister (age 9) and I (19) recently started moving rooms. As I was moving into my new room, my old room (little sister's new room) wasn't quite empty yet as she started to move in, mostly in my closet. While I was emptying the closet, she found my baptism dress. 

Now, I am very religious. I was baptized when I was 8, and the dress no longer fit me. In fact, little sister was also getting baptized a few years ago and the dress fit her then, but I requested she didn't wear it because, well, it's mine. I only wore it the week I got baptized. I would only ever want my daughter to wear it, if I ever have a daughter.

Now, she asked to wear it. I said no. She got upset, and said that the dress didn't even fit me. She also said that she would look so cute in it. I said no again, that the dress was mine and I didn't want her wearing it. She got mad and left the room. I still had things to put away in my room, so I grabbed the rest of my books and went to my new room. A few minutes later, I heard her knock the door. 

I looked over and when she opened the door, she was wearing the dress!!! This wasn't even that long later- she must have instantly put it on once I left the room because of how quick she knocked on the door. She started twirling around and said, ""See? I look cute!""

I must admit, (although I don't want to) I SCREAMED at her to take it off now. She seemed surprised and said ""Why?"" I screamed ""That's my baptism dress, I didn't want you wearing it!!!""

She immediately took it off and gave it back to me. She apologized and said, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know it was your baptism dress."" I told her it didn't matter, I didn't accept her apology, and that she shouldn't have worn it anyway. She got mad again and huffed that I should have told her and if I had told her she wouldn't have worn it. 

Now she got mad and started crying and went to our mom. Mom told me to forgive her because while it happened, it wouldn't happen again, and there was no point to causing contention in the household. I get that, and I believe that we need to turn the other cheek and such, but I also believe that see needs to be held accountable, because she does these things frequently. I will leave things on the table and find them messed with, used, or broken. When I confront her, she says that I shouldn't have left them on the table, which is what our parents say. (though they do tell her not to mess with them, but she receives no punishment)

I tried to tell her the reason I'm not forgiving her isn't because she wore the dress exactly, but because she over stepped a boundary I had previously set and that while she says she's constantly sorry, she always does it again and again.

My parents (43M, 42F) are still paying for my tuition fees while I cover my living expenses. My mother's younger brother (the said uncle, 35M) gambles a lot. This first started during COVID. He had a food business which did not go down but the revenue decreased A LOT (they still had enough money to go by!). He got into gambling back then and none of the family knew. He blew up around 2-3 years worth his income and got into debt of around 120,000 (in usd - but we're not from the us). 

Our grandma had her pension money but couldn't afford to pay back this much given my uncle has a wife (36F) and a daughter (5F now) and my aunt didn't earn enough to support the entire house. My mother and my aunts (also my mother's siblings - 43F, 39F) had to pay off his debts on the condition that he would stop working on his business and get a job under one of my father's acquaintances (mostly so that they could keep an eye on him). A few months ago, he started another business (related to solar panels) and had been doing well when all hell broke loose and we started getting edited nudes of our relatives on our phones because he had once again blown up so much money and acquired so much debt (even purchased a car with it!). 

My mother has been oddly forgiving and decided to help him once again but it's even more than half of my mother's yearly salary (my mother earns more than my uncle does).

I make significantly more than this friend, however he's been in his current job for longer than I and makes at least \~$59/hour at 100 hours/month, so by my math approx 70k yearly. 

To put it succinctly, I make quite a bit more than that. We took a trip last year, where he insisted we put the hotel on my credit card, and he would pay me back. He sent about a third of what he owed, and I decided to write the rest off as future Christmas presents, etc, rather than pester him over it.

  
This year he invited himself to a trip I was already taking, and seemed surprised when I asked him to split the cost of the hotel. He said he was surprised I would ask, and I was direct but polite and said that if he was staying at the hotel with me, that logically he'd help pay for it. He said he would and never did.

I'm planning to go to an upcoming industry conference, and he lives nearby and said he wanted to come. Initially he said he had friends also coming, and we'd all get an AirBNB type rental, but then suddenly those friends weren't coming, and he said we'd get a hotel. He picked a decent but not cheap place (think $400/night). 

Having thought over all this, I decided this trip will be the test, and that I would insist he book the hotel and I'd pay him back, and wipe out what he owes. 

The day he went to book the hotel he called me and said ""Oh I made a large purchase and now I don't have enough money to book it, you book it and I'll pay you back, you know I always do.""

When I told him the total cost- of the hotel \*he\* decided we would stay at- he told me it was expensive. 

I've discussed before that I'm surprised that he hasn't paid me back for some of this, and the answers range from ""oh I forgot"" to ""oh I thought you said you'd pay for that"". I don't recall ever saying anything of the sort, and keep careful track of my money. 

  
I've gotten the impression that he thinks- but hasn't said- that I should just pay for it, because of my higher salary. Every time I bring it up I get deflection and excuses.

In the group of people who do there are those who don’t want to but feel obligated, and there are those in the other group who want to but understand they can’t responsibly do it.

163,1ez0zze,AITA for lying to and leaving my best friend because I thought it would be better for both of us?,"I (16M) have been singing with my best friend (also 16M, we'll call him Aidan) at local venues for a few years now. He has a dream of putting on a performance even better than one he saw as a kid that's become sort of a legend in our town, and so he asked me if I could be his singing partner. 

My dad is a pianist and raised me to be the same, but I decided to quit when I was in middle school and I still feel really guilty about it. He always made me play piano all day long and wouldn't let me hang out with friends or go on school field trips or do anything fun in my spare time, but I still feel bad about leaving all that behind when he put so much effort into teaching me. I only picked up singing to escape piano; I find it really fun. But Aidan is way more serious about it than I am. 

Anyway, there's this one girl we know who Aidan really respects (16F, we'll call her Anne), and they have the same dream. She recently found a singing partner of her own (15F), but the new girl is super inexperienced, so Aidan thought Anne wasn't taking singing seriously anymore and got kind of offended about it, calling them half-hearted and stuff. 

Anne's friend recently proved herself to actually have the drive to reach their dreams, so Aidan begrudgingly apologized for being mean and said he approved of them. I, on the other hand, realized I'M the half-hearted one, since I'm only singing to escape my dad-- and because I thought it'd tick him off-- and if Aidan hated Anne's partner so much for that, then he probably didn't want me around, either. I'm pretty sure I was only dragging him down and stopping him from reaching his dreams, so I felt really bad and decided to quit being his singing partner. 

I knew Aidan wouldn't let me break up with him if I told him the truth, so I basically lied and told him his dream was super childish and stupid and the music we perform together is totally meaningless, and that he needs to grow up. I meant well, since I knew he could be happier without me, but I knew all the things that would make him the most upset and said them. I'm also maybe the only person he trusts, since his parents act like he doesn't exist and his personality makes it hard for him to find friends. He got really mad and almost cried and ran off, and now we're not speaking to each other, like I'd planned on, but I DO think it's better this way, right? This way I'm not being selfish, and I'm letting him go?

164,1ez0y04,"AITA for Asking My Husband to Cancel His ""Bro’s Only"" Trip to Help Me With Our Newborn After He Promised He Would?","This situation has caused a lot of tension between my husband and me, and now I’m questioning whether I’m being unreasonable.

I (30F) gave birth to our first child, *Olivia*, two months ago. Being a first-time mom has been both beautiful and overwhelming. My husband, *Jake* (32M), was incredibly supportive during the pregnancy and promised that after Olivia was born, he would be there for me every step of the way, especially during those challenging first few months.

Before Olivia was born, Jake and his friends had been planning a ""bro’s only"" trip for this summer—a week-long vacation to a cabin in the mountains for hiking, fishing, and bonding. When the trip was being discussed, I reminded Jake that Olivia would only be a few months old, and we would be deep in the newborn phase. He reassured me that if things got too tough, he would cancel the trip to help me out, and I trusted him.

Now that Olivia is here, things have been harder than I anticipated. Between the sleepless nights, breastfeeding struggles, and just trying to adjust to motherhood, I’ve been feeling overwhelmed. Jake has been helpful, but I can tell he’s excited about this trip, which is coming up next month.

Last week, I asked Jake if he could consider canceling the trip, reminding him of his promise. I told him that I’m struggling and that having him gone for a whole week would be really tough on me. He seemed surprised and a bit hurt that I was asking him to cancel. He said he’s been looking forward to this trip for months, and that he needs a break, too. He also pointed out that his parents live nearby and could help if I needed support while he was away.

I understand that Jake needs a break and wants to spend time with his friends, but I can’t help feeling like this is a time when I really need him by my side. I tried to explain that while I appreciate his parents' help, it’s not the same as having him here. Jake said that I’m being unfair by asking him to cancel the trip after all the planning that went into it and that I need to trust him to make sure I’m supported even if he’s not physically there.

Now, we’re at a bit of a standoff. Some of my friends think I should let him go, saying that it’s important for him to have some time away, especially after all the stress of becoming a new dad. But others agree that it’s too soon for him to take off for a week, and that he should prioritize being home with me and Olivia.

So AITA for asking my husband to cancel his ""bro’s only"" trip to help me with our newborn after he promised he would?

edit:

Hey, everyone. I just wanted to give a quick update after reading through most of the replies. I was honestly overwhelmed by the amount of support and understanding I received—thank you so much to everyone who took the time to respond. Your kind words and thoughtful advice really helped me feel less alone in this situation.

A lot of you suggested that I should also take a week off, letting Jake stay with Olivia, to get a break for myself. I really appreciate the sentiment behind that suggestion, but there are a couple of reasons why it’s not realistic for me right now. First of all, I’m breastfeeding, so being away from Olivia for that long would be really difficult logistically. But beyond that, and this is something I know I need to work on, I just don’t feel comfortable being away from my baby yet. I know it’s not healthy to feel like I can’t have her out of my sight, but I can’t help it. I guess it’s just that new mom anxiety that’s really hard to shake.

I’ve been debating whether or not to show Jake this thread. I’m worried that reading it might hurt his feelings, but I’m definitely going to have another conversation with him about everything. I’m willing to compromise and let him go on the trip, but I think a whole week is just too much. I’m leaning towards suggesting that he limit the trip to a maximum of three nights, so he can still have some time away with his friends but not be gone for an entire week.

I’ll update again after we’ve talked. Thanks again for all the support, everyone. It really means a lot to me.

Also, I'm new to Reddit, not sure if I should be posting updates or just editing this post.

  
UPDATE

Hey, everyone. I just wanted to share another update after having a very long and emotional talk with Jake. I won’t get into every detail of our conversation, but I’ll touch on the most important points.

After putting Olivia to bed, I went straight to bed myself, feeling utterly exhausted. Jake was already asleep, but for some reason, the weight of everything just hit me all at once, and I started crying uncontrollably. My sobbing woke Jake up, and he immediately asked me what was wrong. I told him that I was just tired, but then I opened up about how anxious I’d been feeling about his trip and being left alone with Olivia. I admitted something I’ve been reluctant to say out loud—that Jake hasn’t been as involved as I thought he would be. This was one of my biggest fears when we found out we were having a baby.

For context, Jake has a rocky relationship with his own dad. I won't go into detail about why his dad isn't the best but his mom (my mother-in-law) remarried when Jake was in middle school, and his dad wasn’t very present in his life. Jake has expressed to me before that becoming a father was scary for him because he’s afraid of being a bad one, just like his dad. When he first told me that, I thought it would make him into a great father, because it showed how much he cared about being a good dad long before we were even pregnant.

When I vented to him about all of this, at first, he tried to defend himself. He admitted that he’s been freaking out about having a baby for so long and just didn’t want to tell me. He said he didn’t want to stress me out while I was pregnant because he knows how much I’ve always wanted to be a mother. Hearing him say that made me feel guilty, like I hadn’t seen how much he’s been struggling internally. I had tried to convince him that he was going to be a great dad when we had this conversation long ago, and now it all felt more complicated.

I thought to myself, *This can’t go on much longer.* I realized that if he was going to keep pulling away like this, I didn’t know if I could handle it. So I asked him, “Is this what our life is going to look like from now on? Me with Olivia and you away? Because if it is, Jake, then I don’t think I can continue on like this.”

Jake told me to calm down and assured me that he wasn’t going anywhere. Then he got really emotional—he even started to tear up. He said he didn’t want to turn into his dad, and that he hadn’t realized that going on this trip could be a preliminary step toward becoming the absentee father he feared he might be. He apologized for not considering me and Olivia as much as he should have.

Long story short, Jake called his friends and told them he wouldn’t be able to make the trip. He’s even started planning a little family getaway for the three of us next year when Olivia is a bit older. It was a tough conversation, but I feel like we’re on the same page now, and I’m hopeful that things will get better from here.

This situation has caused a lot of tension between my husband and me, and now I’m questioning whether I’m being unreasonable.

I (30F) gave birth to our first child, *Olivia*, two months ago. Being a first-time mom has been both beautiful and overwhelming. My husband, *Jake* (32M), was incredibly supportive during the pregnancy and promised that after Olivia was born, he would be there for me every step of the way, especially during those challenging first few months.

Before Olivia was born, Jake and his friends had been planning a ""bro’s only"" trip for this summer—a week-long vacation to a cabin in the mountains for hiking, fishing, and bonding. When the trip was being discussed, I reminded Jake that Olivia would only be a few months old, and we would be deep in the newborn phase. He reassured me that if things got too tough, he would cancel the trip to help me out, and I trusted him.

Now that Olivia is here, things have been harder than I anticipated. Between the sleepless nights, breastfeeding struggles, and just trying to adjust to motherhood, I’ve been feeling overwhelmed. Jake has been helpful, but I can tell he’s excited about this trip, which is coming up next month.

Last week, I asked Jake if he could consider canceling the trip, reminding him of his promise. I told him that I’m struggling and that having him gone for a whole week would be really tough on me. He seemed surprised and a bit hurt that I was asking him to cancel. He said he’s been looking forward to this trip for months, and that he needs a break, too. He also pointed out that his parents live nearby and could help if I needed support while he was away.

I understand that Jake needs a break and wants to spend time with his friends, but I can’t help feeling like this is a time when I really need him by my side. I tried to explain that while I appreciate his parents' help, it’s not the same as having him here. Jake said that I’m being unfair by asking him to cancel the trip after all the planning that went into it and that I need to trust him to make sure I’m supported even if he’s not physically there.

Now, we’re at a bit of a standoff. Some of my friends think I should let him go, saying that it’s important for him to have some time away, especially after all the stress of becoming a new dad. But others agree that it’s too soon for him to take off for a week, and that he should prioritize being home with me and Olivia.

So AITA for asking my husband to cancel his ""bro’s only"" trip to help me with our newborn after he promised he would?

edit:

Hey, everyone. I just wanted to give a quick update after reading through most of the replies. I was honestly overwhelmed by the amount of support and understanding I received—thank you so much to everyone who took the time to respond. Your kind words and thoughtful advice really helped me feel less alone in this situation.

A lot of you suggested that I should also take a week off, letting Jake stay with Olivia, to get a break for myself. I really appreciate the sentiment behind that suggestion, but there are a couple of reasons why it’s not realistic for me right now. First of all, I’m breastfeeding, so being away from Olivia for that long would be really difficult logistically. But beyond that, and this is something I know I need to work on, I just don’t feel comfortable being away from my baby yet. I know it’s not healthy to feel like I can’t have her out of my sight, but I can’t help it. I guess it’s just that new mom anxiety that’s really hard to shake.

I’ve been debating whether or not to show Jake this thread. I’m worried that reading it might hurt his feelings, but I’m definitely going to have another conversation with him about everything. I’m willing to compromise and let him go on the trip, but I think a whole week is just too much. I’m leaning towards suggesting that he limit the trip to a maximum of three nights, so he can still have some time away with his friends but not be gone for an entire week.

I’ll update again after we’ve talked. Thanks again for all the support, everyone. It really means a lot to me.

Also, I'm new to Reddit, not sure if I should be posting updates or just editing this post.

  
UPDATE

Hey, everyone. I just wanted to share another update after having a very long and emotional talk with Jake. I won’t get into every detail of our conversation, but I’ll touch on the most important points.

After putting Olivia to bed, I went straight to bed myself, feeling utterly exhausted. Jake was already asleep, but for some reason, the weight of everything just hit me all at once, and I started crying uncontrollably. My sobbing woke Jake up, and he immediately asked me what was wrong. I told him that I was just tired, but then I opened up about how anxious I’d been feeling about his trip and being left alone with Olivia. I admitted something I’ve been reluctant to say out loud—that Jake hasn’t been as involved as I thought he would be. This was one of my biggest fears when we found out we were having a baby.

For context, Jake has a rocky relationship with his own dad. I won't go into detail about why his dad isn't the best but his mom (my mother-in-law) remarried when Jake was in middle school, and his dad wasn’t very present in his life. Jake has expressed to me before that becoming a father was scary for him because he’s afraid of being a bad one, just like his dad. When he first told me that, I thought it would make him into a great father, because it showed how much he cared about being a good dad long before we were even pregnant.

When I vented to him about all of this, at first, he tried to defend himself. He admitted that he’s been freaking out about having a baby for so long and just didn’t want to tell me. He said he didn’t want to stress me out while I was pregnant because he knows how much I’ve always wanted to be a mother. Hearing him say that made me feel guilty, like I hadn’t seen how much he’s been struggling internally. I had tried to convince him that he was going to be a great dad when we had this conversation long ago, and now it all felt more complicated.

I thought to myself, *This can’t go on much longer.* I realized that if he was going to keep pulling away like this, I didn’t know if I could handle it. So I asked him, “Is this what our life is going to look like from now on? Me with Olivia and you away? Because if it is, Jake, then I don’t think I can continue on like this.”

Jake told me to calm down and assured me that he wasn’t going anywhere. Then he got really emotional—he even started to tear up. He said he didn’t want to turn into his dad, and that he hadn’t realized that going on this trip could be a preliminary step toward becoming the absentee father he feared he might be. He apologized for not considering me and Olivia as much as he should have.

Long story short, Jake called his friends and told them he wouldn’t be able to make the trip. He’s even started planning a little family getaway for the three of us next year when Olivia is a bit older. It was a tough conversation, but I feel like we’re on the same page now, and I’m hopeful that things will get better from here.

Thanks again to everyone for your support and advice. It’s been an emotional rollercoaster, but I’m grateful for this community helping me navigate it.",0.0,0.09974102675914764,0,1
165,1ez0sou,AITA for the way i acted with my best friend over a birthday party? ,"I (24F) have been best friends with my friend (26F) for the last 3 years she recently uninvited my family and me from her son’s birthday party. To provide context, we met through my sister-in-law, who is her boyfriend’s sister. We both have children of similar ages and would frequently spend time together, including activities like wine nights, karaoke, baking, and cooking. During this time, my friend expressed dissatisfaction with how her boyfriend’s sisters—my sister-in-law and her two siblings—treated her and her child, noting that they were often overlooked in favor of the children of one of the sisters.

We had a close relationship, and my friend confided in me about various issues, including negative remarks from the sisters about her weight and tattoos. Her mother-in-law also expressed concerns about me, suggesting that I might be interested in her boyfriend, which I found upsetting. Despite these issues, I supported my friend and maintained our close bond.

Recently, my brother informed me that he is divorcing my sister-in-law, which has caused some changes. My friend had initially invited us to her son's birthday party and requested that I take time off work to attend. However, she later texted me saying that given the current situation, it might be best if we did not attend. I believe that the issues between my brother and sister-in-law should not affect our friendship or the event. I mentioned to her that our friendship should remain unaffected by external factors. But she said no I then got upset because I truly saw her as a sister
Is it reasonable for me to react the way I did about being uninvited from her son's birthday party?

166,1ez0kog,"AITA for telling my sister she can’t live with me unless she stops ""practicing witchcraft?""","So, my (31M) sister (22F) recently moved into my place after breaking up with her boyfriend. What I didn’t realize was just how far she’s taken her whole “witchcraft” thing. I knew she was into wicca and read a lot about the history of witchcraft, but I always assumed her interest was purely academic. BOY WAS I WRONG.

The day she moved in she set up a full-on altar in her room. There are now pentagrams on the walls, black candles everywhere, and jars filled with who-knows-what lining the shelves. She put up these creepy dolls with pins stuck in them. I don’t know if they’re supposed to be voodoo dolls, but they’re seriously disturbing.

The night after move-in, she decided to hold a “full moon ritual” in my living room. She was dressed in a satin robe, chanting in some language (I think Latin), and waving around this giant staff she apparently made herself. Then she started throwing what looked like wet animal bones into a circle of salt she made on my floor.

A couple of nights later, I woke up at 3 AM to weird noises and found her in the backyard, dancing around a fire she’d started in my metal trash can. She was tossing herbs, papers, and some other stuff into the fire, and I’m pretty sure I saw her drop a photo of her ex in there. I confronted her about it, and she calmly explained that she was doing a “banishing spell” to rid herself of “negative energy.”

She’s been leaving “offerings” around the house. Like bowls of raw meat, coins, and strange liquids just sitting out in random corners. I’m a vegetarian and kind of a neat freak so the smell of uncooked meat and parade of ants through my kitchen is really putting me on edge.

She has quit THREE good paying jobs in the past year because of tarot card readings. She said the cards told her that her bosses were “energy vampires” trying to drain her life force. Instead of addressing her problems like a normal person, she just walked out of each job without notice, leaving her broke and jobless—hence why she’s living with me.

Last week I went out of town for work. Upon my return, I discovered my elderly cat, Mitzi, was missing. My sister says the cat jumped out, ran down the street, and disappeared. The thing is, Mitzi isn’t very spry and has never tried to run away. Given my sister's recent behavior I began to suspect she might have done something terrible. While I don't have concrete proof, the combination of her intense rituals and Mitzi’s disappearance makes me worry she might have harmed her.

Yesterday I came home and found my sister in the dining room. She’d drawn a giant pentagram on my hardwood floor with chalk. When I asked what the hell she was doing, she said she was trying to summon a spirit to help her figure out why her life was “out of balance.” I finally had enough and told her she either needs to tone down the witchcraft or find somewhere else to live. She freaked out, accusing me of trying to suppress her spiritual freedom and saying I don’t understand what she’s been through. The thing is, I’m fairly certain that she doesn’t even understand what she’s “going through.” I feel like she needs to get help. I love my sister more than anyone else in the entire world and I’m tired of seeing her destroy her life over and over again with her fickle impulsivity. She’s not the first member of our family to spiral due to religious mania.

167,1eyzx1e,AITA for telling my friend she can't bring her boyfriend to my best friend's quinceñera?,"I'm a 15-year-old girl, and I’m in the court for my best friend’s (let’s call her Ella) quinceañera. We’ve been practicing for months, and Ella is super excited for it, as am I. The issue started when Ella sent out invitations. She invited our mutual friend, Jenna, and some others via our group chat. Jenna then asked if she could bring a plus one.

Ella immediately texted me privately because we both knew Jenna would want to bring her boyfriend, Sam. Now, here's the thing: Ella and I *do not* like Sam. Besides his annoying personality, he has a history of developing intense crushes on girls he barely knows and trying to pursue them, even if they’re already in relationships. Ella went to middle school with him and says he's always been like that, plus he's rude and disrespectful. Because of this, Ella decided not to ask Jenna to be in the court, as she knew Jenna would want Sam to be her escort. This decision caused some unspoken tension between them, but that's a different story.

When Jenna asked if she could bring a plus one, Ella told her she could but needed to know who it was to avoid any randoms, as the quince isn’t an open invite. Ella made it clear to me that she didn’t want Sam there. It’s her day, so she has every right to decide who gets to come. Jenna is also fully aware that Ella and I don’t like Sam; she’s known since before they started dating.

Fast forward to yesterday, just days before the quinceañera, Jenna texted me asking if Ella would be mad if she brought Sam. My first instinct was to text Ella and ask her what she wanted me to say, but I didn’t. I already knew she didn’t want him there, and the fact that Jenna texted me instead of Ella made it clear that she knew that too. So, I told Jenna that it would be better if he didn’t come. When she asked why, I told her Ella doesn’t need a reason; it’s her day, and she should be comfortable. Jenna then got upset, saying it was shitty of Ella to not even try to like Sam and that she’s noticed the looks we give each other when Sam’s around and how we leave rooms when he enters. To be clear, neither Ella nor I have ever said or done anything rude to Sam directly; we just prefer to avoid him.

At this point, I sent Ella screenshots of the texts with Jenna. Ella was upset and asked why I didn’t tell her immediately. She said that wasn’t what she would have said at all and that I should have told Jenna to talk to her instead of me. She thinks it wasn’t my place to speak on her behalf, and now both Jenna and Ella are upset with me.

169,1eyzvzg,AITA for giving my brother the cold shoulder over what amounts to a scheduling mixup?,"This is deeply petty, but I'm self-aware enough to know I have no objectivity here. Long story short, I had a (voluntary, administrative) court date. Due to disability, I can't drive, so I asked my brother, who is currently living at home with me and my parents, to give me a ride. He agreed in vague and then concrete terms once I had a date, time, and place. (My dad was taking my mom to a medical appointment, and public transit in our area is basically nonexistent.) To sweeten the pot, I threw in a stash of [candy he likes and I don't] as payment.

Day before, I check in with him, tell him the appointment's at 1 so we're leaving at 12:15. Google says it only takes ~20 minutes to get there, but I want to build in time for finding the place, getting inside, any paperwork, etc, since I've never done this or been there before. I didn't tell him that, just that we needed to leave at quarter after 12. He said okay.

Day of, I come by at 11:15 to check in and say, ""Are you ready to go in an hour?"" He says yes, I wander off. Around 12 I rejoin him in the living room with my papers and things and wait for him to be ready. At 12:15 he gets up and goes upstairs, and I figure he's using the restroom or getting his coat or whatever. And then I hear the goddamn shower turn on.

Some people can take a shower in three minutes. My brother isn't one of them. My only saving grace was that as luck would have it, Mom's appointment got deferred, so they came home early and at 12:25 I asked Dad for a ride and he was nice enough to get back in the car after he'd already been driving for an hour.

When we get home, Brother is back where he was in the living room. He says something generic to me along the lines of, ""So how'd it go?"" and I pretty much ignore him because I'm pissed, which I know isn't real mature but is probably better than reaming him out. Mom, bless her heart, tries to make peace by prodding Brother into saying he thought we were leaving at 12:30. I don't really say much to that and the conversation moves on.

Cut to today, about a week later. I have pizza that I'm eating for dinner. It's not huge, but there's enough to share. Brother asks (in a normal voice) if he can have a slice. I ask if he's going to apologize for not taking me to [court location]. He asks, for some reason in nearly a whisper, if I'm ""still mad about that."" I say yes, I am, because he agreed to do something and then didn't do it. He says, still very quietly, ""You need to learn to let things go."" I tell him he better let the pizza go, then. He leaves the room.

He's definitely an asshole for flaking on me in the first place, but am I an asshole for holding a grudge about it? Should I just chalk it up to miscommunication and let it go? Or is he the asshole for breaking his word and not even pretending to be the least bit sorry about it?

I didn't tell him that, just that we needed to leave at quarter after 12. He said okay.

Day of, I come by at 11:15 to check in and say, ""Are you ready to go in an hour?"" He says yes, I wander off. Around 12 I rejoin him in the living room with my papers and things and wait for him to be ready. At 12:15 he gets up and goes upstairs, and I figure he's using the restroom or getting his coat or whatever. And then I hear the goddamn shower turn on.

Some people can take a shower in three minutes. My brother isn't one of them. My only saving grace was that as luck would have it, Mom's appointment got deferred, so they came home early and at 12:25 I asked Dad for a ride and he was nice enough to get back in the car after he'd already been driving for an hour.

When we get home, Brother is back where he was in the living room. He says something generic to me along the lines of, ""So how'd it go?"" and I pretty much ignore him because I'm pissed, which I know isn't real mature but is probably better than reaming him out. Mom, bless her heart, tries to make peace by prodding Brother into saying he thought we were leaving at 12:30. I don't really say much to that and the conversation moves on.

Cut to today, about a week later. I have pizza that I'm eating for dinner. It's not huge, but there's enough to share. Brother asks (in a normal voice) if he can have a slice. I ask if he's going to apologize for not taking me to [court location]. He asks, for some reason in nearly a whisper, if I'm ""still mad about that."" I say yes, I am, because he agreed to do something and then didn't do it. He says, still very quietly, ""You need to learn to let things go."" I tell him he better let the pizza go, then. He leaves the room.

He's definitely an asshole for flaking on me in the first place, but am I an asshole for holding a grudge about it? Should I just chalk it up to miscommunication and let it go? Or is he the asshole for breaking his word and not even pretending to be the least bit sorry about it? Am I making a point of principle or just being a petty bitch?",0.0,1.0579098463058472,1,0
170,1eyzsw6,"AITA for refusing to attend a beach trip with my wife, kids and MIL","My wife 39M and our 8yo have plans to go to the beach with my MIL this weekend.  I, 40M and our 3yo are not going.  I coach our 8yo's soccer team, and even though I am not ok with her skipping our first game, the compromise is that she can skip for the beach trip because there has been no other weekend this summer for MIL and family to go.

  
Yesterday, MIL claimed she is 'disappointed' that the whole family is not going, and it is either everyone or no one.  I stated to my wife that I have made commitments to our team, and this is why we needed this sort of planned trip to happen before school and soccer start back up.  You see, every single month of the summer, my wife constantly mentions to her mother that we are still looking to work out a plan for the beach, and every weekend we offer, she is always busy.  Either with my SIL using the beach house, or MIL with SIL at beach house, or some other excuse that shows we are just not a priority.  

  
The dynamic between wife and MIL is complicated, because my wife wants to have a relationship with her, but MIL wants to correct, criticize, and manipulate constantly.  We don't raise our children correctly for her, we don't make family or financial decisions correctly, the fact that my wife is a stay at home mom is offensive to her, and so on.  This creates a lot of anxiety and stress in my wife, and when MIL treats her this way, my wife tends to project onto me or the kids - treating us the same way.  This has gone on for years and caused a major rift in our relationship.  Based on some summer encounters with MIL, things are at their boiling point with us and I shared with my wife that a beach trip with her mother makes me afraid it could ruin or end our marriage.  

  
She still wants to consider going, because its not fair to our 8yo that she cant see her grandma, and this has been something we have tried to plan.  MIL says the trip ""won't be worth it"" unless we drive down on Friday (I work M-F normal office hours), or very early Saturday, because arriving at noon on Saturday, and leaving at noon on Sunday just is not worth it to her.  

  
I still will not go, and told my wife I will support whatever she wants to do.  She does not have to do it my way but our 8yo has started to express emotions about how MIL treats mom, and it weights heavy in our household.  Because of that, I told my wife I am reluctant to share my opinion because I do not want to make her feel forced one way or the other, and shared with her that if it was my decision I would cancel.  

  
I truly am worried about her going, but also willing to compromise and support them going out there.

We're all very close but there's one (18M) who's more on the difficult side? It's hard to describe him but all you need to know is that he can be very hard to convince when it comes to doing things he doesn't want to and hates when things don't go his way. 

There was this competition type event I wanted to do with our group and I signed us all up despite not asking first. Two (19M & 18M) were fine with it and are looking forward to it. The ""difficult"" one was not happy with me though. The competition does require participants to go through some... difficult tasks that can be embarrassing or really difficult and I believe he's afraid that he'll humiliate himself in front of everyone. I feel bad for not asking before but I know he would have just said no and probably tell me not to sign-up either. I want him to push out of his comfort zone just a little, we all think that's what he needs. 

Now he's acting all moody and is refusing to speak with me and I feel bad. Was I in the wrong here?

172,1eyzjdj,AITAH for not inviting my 5 siblings to my wedding?,"I (25F) and getting married to my future husband (28M) in a month. We can host a max of 70 people. We sent out invites a few months ahead of time, as the entirety of my family has to drive 3 hours to where we currently live and are getting married. Two days before the RSVPs are due I decide to text the last few stragglers who haven’t responded yet. 

When my biological father (48M) responded that he would be there with his fiancée (33F) and their 5 children (ages like 15-3) I was a bit taken aback because I very specifically addressed the invitation to only “Mr [biological father’s name] and Ms [fiancées name]” rather than “Mr [biological father’s name] and family”. Background is important here because I do not have a close relationship with my biological father. I’ve met my step siblings a handful of times and my half siblings only twice. I also did not invite my mom’s current husband’s children (all 6 are adults, I’m not close with them). 

My biological father absolutely lost his shit about how he can’t bring his kids and how crushed the kids will be for “not seeing their sister get married”. I would not back down and told him multiple times that I have limited seating and can only feed so many people. He said “this is MY proposal” and offered to come down, with the uninvited children, for only the ceremony and leave so they can see me get married and I can “save money”. The wedding is already entirely paid for, but okay whatever you say…. He said he had to protect the kids - I asked “do you forget that I’m your fucking child too?” And ended the conversation with telling him that he and his fiancée can attend without the kids or not to come at all.

173,1eyyrzv,AITA for telling a friend about my relationship?,"This morning my partner (37F) and I (35F) had a fight. I told my work friend about it, and now my partner is upset at me for that, too.

I have anxiety when it comes to talking about a certain topic. It’s something I’ve been working on in therapy. This morning while my partner was at work, I realized I needed to tell her something, so I texted her. We talked about it via text for a while and I didn’t feel as much anxiety texting her vs telling her face to face. I thought I had found an excellent solution to my communication anxiety! Unfortunately it WASN’T a good solution for her. She was dealing with a lot of crap at work, and then from her perspective I dumped more crap on top of it and she got overwhelmed. When she told me that, I apologized. We agreed to discuss it more tonight, and then I went to work as well.

I have a work friend I’ll call Nancy. She could tell that I was flustered when I came in and asked me what was wrong. I gave her almost the exact same explanation as above. \[edit to add: with about the same amount of detail\] I thought I was being a good communicator, but it was only good for me and not for my partner, so it wasn’t the amazing breakthrough I thought it was. She said something along the lines of, “Yeah, I could see how she’d be frustrated by that. But you guys will work it out. You always do.” It was a brief conversation but it made me feel better. After that, we talked about other things for a bit and got to work.

About an hour later I received another text from my partner saying, “One thing. Did you tell Nancy about our fight?” I was honest and told her, “Yeah, Nancy saw that I was upset so I told her \[insert near verbatim conversation\].” This is what set her off. She says that I always want to talk to other people before I talk to her, and that it’s wrong to discuss relationship problems with others when we haven’t worked things out together yet.

She has told me before that she doesn’t like it when I discuss our relationship problems with others, but I thought she meant that she didn’t like it when we were in the middle of a huge fight, or when I think she’s wrong and I’m right, and I avoid talking to her and go vent to a friend instead. That would make sense, because she’s available for discussion and we should work things out together instead of talking shit about each other. But this wasn’t like that at all…was it?

In my mind, the original fight was my fault, and I felt bad about it. I didn’t do it on purpose, but I apologized and we agreed to talk in person later. I thought we were handling the situation pretty well considering. When Nancy asked what was wrong, I didn’t think twice about telling her. But according to my partner, I shouldn’t tell anyone any of our issues until they are completely resolved. At least that’s what I think she is saying? Either way I’m sleeping on the couch tonight. AITA?

174,1eyyr2x,AITA: Worst Mom Ever Edition? Kids Moved Away As Adults.,"Word count so keeping it short. I (F50) got divorced at 34. I have two kids, Ainsley (25) and Nate (21) who were 9 and 5 when we split. Ex and I co parented well and still do. I bought a house early on so the kids wouldn't need to move. He played the real estate market and did very well (rentals, etc.). I waived child support as we split custody (he made 3x my income). 

Over the years, the kids chose to live with me most of the time, not bc he wasn't a good dad, but bc I tended to be more accessible with work and location. My son is high functioning ASD, and I was definitely his safe person. Lots of hospitalizations, called out of school, fighting to mainstream him. I went to all the appts. Everything. I fully admit I didn't give Ainsley all she needed, but through family therapy (ex and I both participated, we both love our kids to death) we got ourselves on track. 3 years ago ex got transferred out of state (US). In the meantime, I got promoted multiple times and now own a home (before I had a townhome, very small) with a yard. I also started a dog rescue so I've been pulled in every direction. We wanted Nate to go to the other state to give him a fresh start (he is impressionable and was with a bad group of kids) and Ainsley chose to go bc she loves the state they moved to bc we vacationed there often. 

I go to visit them 4 times a year (it's a short flight). I offer for them to come here and I'll pay. I have rooms set up for them with how they want them to be. I recently found out ex is getting transferred back here (my state) bc of his parents (I help take care of them, they are ill and I love them) and I've offered for my children to move back into my home. Complicating this is Ainsley is not my ex's bio daughter. I had her before I met him and just recently she found her bio father. 

I text a lot, I ask them to call, I send care packages. My son Nate has now said he won't come back because he doesn't want to move again (and to be fair, he has a wonderful therapist/support team there). Ainsley will call or text if she needs money or has a medical issue, but otherwise I rarely hear from them. They both forgot Mother's Day and my birthday but to be fair, I've never made a big deal about those. Ainsley said I should have moved when they did and while she loves me, if I loved them I would have moved too. I simply couldn't have. I could now, however. I've been promoted and make more than my ex. But I don't want to leave my friends and support system here and I don't know what to do. AITA for not moving states to re-engage with my adult kids?
