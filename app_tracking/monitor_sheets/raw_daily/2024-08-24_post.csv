0,1f01gjo,AITA for ignoring my relatives to avoid an argument?,"so i (nb14) am on holiday at the moment, with my mum and sister. we’re visiting my nan, which i’ve been worried about for ages. last year, i came out as nonbinary/transmasc, and my nan, who has very far right views, has refused to use the right pronouns or name for me. i feel really uncomfortable whenever someone uses my deadname or she/her for me, but ive learnt to deal with it. However, the thing that’s annoyed me is my mum. 

When i first came out, she completely disagreed with my decision, refusing to change anything about her behaviour. she has slowly come around to it, and has started using my preferred pronouns and name. the whole time we’ve been here, she has been doing the same thing. But today, i woke up and came downstairs to her and my nan talking shit about me. she was telling her about the time that me and my partners (both tm14) were hanging out and ignoring my “friend” (m13), who is actually just a dick who is horrible to me about my lifestyle choices. 

mum made it out that we had left him out because we were “too busy being inappropriate with each other” (we’re all minors, one of my boyfriends is ace and im questioning ace). she made us out to be such horrible people, and my nan said i “have no social grace”. but what really set me off is when she said “oh [deadname] was hanging out with her… “girlfriends” one afternoon…” 

i can deal with me being misgendered but the fact that she called my partners, who are both out as trans dudes and use they/he, my gIRLFRIENDS! shes met both of them and they trust her, so this really upset me. 

i wasnt talking to her because she was putting me down and being horrible, and when i ignored her she said “oh you must being sulking, that’s sad” and continued slagging me off. theyre both now upset with me and i dont think i actually did anything wrong? their behaviour was disgusting and i didnt interact with it because i hate conflict and didnt want to get in an argument, but now ive pissed them off anyway.

1,1ezu1gs,AITA for yelling at my fiancé in the hospital for placing bets on Fanduel and Draft Kings,"Me (21 F identifies as non-binary) and my fiancé (23 M) are in the hospital for some procedures he needed to get done. He called his friend and asks about some sports betting. Keep in mind me and him have no jobs, my mother in law is supporting us atm. He finds out that he has 45$ on Draft kings he never cashed out. I tell him to cash the whole thing out and just delete the app. He proceeded to bet 15$ on some random bet. Both of us have no gas in our cars, no money in our bank accounts and or insurance on our cars. He has a problem in the past for 2 months of last year, where he kept betting on teams and loosing money. He’s lost over 400$. I told him to stop betting on sports or anything similar, he stopped for a year until now.
