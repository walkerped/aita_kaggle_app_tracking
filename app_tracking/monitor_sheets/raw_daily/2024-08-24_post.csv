0,1f01gjo,AITA for ignoring my relatives to avoid an argument?,"so i (nb14) am on holiday at the moment, with my mum and sister. we‚Äôre visiting my nan, which i‚Äôve been worried about for ages. last year, i came out as nonbinary/transmasc, and my nan, who has very far right views, has refused to use the right pronouns or name for me. i feel really uncomfortable whenever someone uses my deadname or she/her for me, but ive learnt to deal with it. However, the thing that‚Äôs annoyed me is my mum. 

When i first came out, she completely disagreed with my decision, refusing to change anything about her behaviour. she has slowly come around to it, and has started using my preferred pronouns and name. the whole time we‚Äôve been here, she has been doing the same thing. But today, i woke up and came downstairs to her and my nan talking shit about me. she was telling her about the time that me and my partners (both tm14) were hanging out and ignoring my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù (m13), who is actually just a dick who is horrible to me about my lifestyle choices. 

mum made it out that we had left him out because we were ‚Äútoo busy being inappropriate with each other‚Äù (we‚Äôre all minors, one of my boyfriends is ace and im questioning ace). she made us out to be such horrible people, and my nan said i ‚Äúhave no social grace‚Äù. but what really set me off is when she said ‚Äúoh [deadname] was hanging out with her‚Ä¶ ‚Äúgirlfriends‚Äù one afternoon‚Ä¶‚Äù 

i can deal with me being misgendered but the fact that she called my partners, who are both out as trans dudes and use they/he, my gIRLFRIENDS! shes met both of them and they trust her, so this really upset me. 

i wasnt talking to her because she was putting me down and being horrible, and when i ignored her she said ‚Äúoh you must being sulking, that‚Äôs sad‚Äù and continued slagging me off. theyre both now upset with me and i dont think i actually did anything wrong? their behaviour was disgusting and i didnt interact with it because i hate conflict and didnt want to get in an argument, but now ive pissed them off anyway.

8,1f0i78q,WIBTA If I had my brother walk me down the aisle instead of my dad or parents together?,"My fianc√© (36M) and I (27F) are getting married next fall.  We are in general having not the most traditional wedding/engagement, I proposed, no bridesmaids/groomsmen, not a religious wedding, no assigned seating, etc, however I am unclear on what to do about who to walk me down the aisle. 

My relationship with my father (65) has never been the best.  He has done his best, however he has undiagnosed and untreated anxiety issues which he has self-medicated with alcohol, leading to this being a major issue in our family growing up.  He has always kept his job and it hasn't caused any financial stability issues or anything like that, however he has always been emotionally abusive towards my mom when he drinks, and on multiple occasions (after I moved out), she has gone to stay at the office to feel safer and in order not to deal with his drunken screaming.  He's really a great person when he's not drinking, but over the years this has put a lot of distance between us.  

  
The other aspect of this is that he has never been particularly supportive of my relationship with my fianc√©.  Between the age difference and the fact that we are from different cultures (I'm from the US, and he's from Latin America), he has struggled fully embrace it.  At the beginning he fully rejected the relationship and said he would never support it etc, leading us to not talk for a few months.  He has since come around and is perfectly cordial, just is clearly forcing it every time he asks how fianc√© is.  

  
For other context, my fianc√© is being walked down by close family members as his parents passed away a number of years ago, so walking down the aisle together is out of the question.  My parents are still together (though growing more distanced from each other).  I am really close to my mom and see her often, but don't see my dad nearly as often.  My brother (30M) has always been one of the biggest supports in my life through family issues as well as everything else, and I think it would be a nice alternative to have him walk me down the aisle rather than my parents, but am not sure if this would be too hurtful.  I haven't talked to my parents about this topic specifically but in general in planning they have been pretty hands off and more of the perspective that we should do whatever we want to.  However my dad is definitely the more traditional of the two, and I think it might be hurtful to him and/or make him incredibly angry and bring much more unneeded anxiety to the whole thing.  I considered just having my mom walk me, but this would be even more hurtful, and my mom doesn't have any attachment to walking me down the aisle.

The other aspect of this is that he has never been particularly supportive of my relationship with my fianc√©.  Between the age difference and the fact that we are from different cultures (I'm from the US, and he's from Latin America), he has struggled fully embrace it.  At the beginning he fully rejected the relationship and said he would never support it etc, leading us to not talk for a few months.  He has since come around and is perfectly cordial, just is clearly forcing it every time he asks how fianc√© is.  

  
For other context, my fianc√© is being walked down by close family members as his parents passed away a number of years ago, so walking down the aisle together is out of the question.  My parents are still together (though growing more distanced from each other).  I am really close to my mom and see her often, but don't see my dad nearly as often.  My brother (30M) has always been one of the biggest supports in my life through family issues as well as everything else, and I think it would be a nice alternative to have him walk me down the aisle rather than my parents, but am not sure if this would be too hurtful.  I haven't talked to my parents about this topic specifically but in general in planning they have been pretty hands off and more of the perspective that we should do whatever we want to.  However my dad is definitely the more traditional of the two, and I think it might be hurtful to him and/or make him incredibly angry and bring much more unneeded anxiety to the whole thing.  I considered just having my mom walk me, but this would be even more hurtful, and my mom doesn't have any attachment to walking me down the aisle.

So, WIBTA if I asked my brother to walk me down the aisle instead of my dad or my parents?",0.0,1.0197558403015137,1,0
9,1f0i3v6,AITA for lashing out on someone I knew for trying to help me?,"So, I (17F) have this acquaintance at school (17F. For convenience, I'll call her Koko) that I've met during my time at highschool. For context, Koko is an extremely analytical person which can very easily deduce people's intentions, since she has a deep interest in psychology.

Now, into the details. In the school I study, I find myself in a circle with four other people who all faced prejudice or traumatic experiences beforehand, with us assissting one another since we can't get proper help.

Since we all find ourselves emotionally unwell due to the unrest we've faced, we've conspired agaisnt some of the people in our school that harass or wrong us. The members of our group haven't been made clear to the others, but it created a bit of a tension around the district. Since Koko could very well deduce who is who, I've purposefully formed a bond with her, even when she tries to push me away, so I could keep our identities a secret for the sake of people not making fun of us for our experiences.

After some time had passed after I met her, some of my friends, Koko and I went to a small concert near our school since two of our classmates left our class. But, Koko pulled me to a secluded area because she wanted to have a talk with me, to say she was able to make sure I was apart of the bond. I tried to dismiss it and tried to make it as clear that I never asked for this and was getting uncomfortable, but she kept cornering me. She said how she hadn't told anyone beforehand and wanted me to help repair the trust between our classmates.

That was until she brought up my biological family. FYI, I was able to be adopted into a better family and escape the abusive household I was once in. But it generated alot of trauma for me, to the point I tried to change my physical appearance to stray as far away from them.

Koko said that, because of the information she was able to gather beforehand, and the fact that I acted too ""perfect"" around her, she was able to come to that conclusion that all I was doing prior to this was just an act, also saying how I had a history with theatre too. She stated that since I was one of the only people to get this close to her, she also wanted to study my emotions so she could get a better grasp of psychology as awhole.

But because of the mention of my biological parents, I became erratic and lashed out on her. If I left the circle, they'd start to conspire agaisnt me too. I told her to not mention it to anyone and to leave me alone, while yelling at her. But after that I ran away and isolated myself for a bit.

I was playing a 9 hole course in the area with some buddies and it was packed. We waited on just about every tee box for the group in front of us to get some distance before we would hit. And for most of the day it was fine, until we got to the last hole.

The last hole is a sharp turn at the end of the fairway (just about 90 degrees) so you can‚Äôt see the green at all until you get up toward the end of the fairway. We saw the group in front of us hit towards the green, so we drove once they had cleared.

While we were waiting in the middle of the fairway, we heard a thud and saw a ball right next our cart. I turned around and saw the guy behind us had just hit. He shrugged and walked to his cart, so I picked his ball up.

After we finished putting, he pulls up and asks ‚Äúdid one of you take my ball?‚Äù I answered ‚ÄúYes, I grabbed it‚Äù and started walking in his direction. He asks if he can get it back and why I would take it. I told him I grabbed it because I wanted to ask why he hit into our group with no warning. The conversation went about as follows:

Me: ‚ÄúDid you see us wave back or give any confirmation that we saw you?‚Äù (This is where I‚Äôm afraid I may have had a snarkier tone)

12,1f0hhvj,AITA for refusing to buy a bridesmaid's dress until I get closer to my goal weight?,"My (28F) sister ‚ÄúBri‚Äù 29F is getting married a year from now. Recently, she reached out to ask me to be a bridesmaid. I was surprised because Bri and I aren‚Äôt super close, but I was happy to be a part of her special day.

I used to be extremely overweight, and last year I decided to take control of my health and lost 75 pounds. I‚Äôm much happier and healthier than I was, but I‚Äôd still like to lose another 60. This became complicated when Bri sent us a link to the dress she wanted us to buy. I‚Äôve never been a bridesmaid, but apparently it is common for brides to ask their bridesmaids to buy their own dress. Still, the dress she requested costed $300, which seemed pricey to me. Bri has asked us to order the dress within a couple of weeks, as it‚Äôs popular and she‚Äôs worried it will sell out.

I called Bri and told her I am on a weightloss journey and am not buying clothes, until I get closer to my goal weight unless they‚Äôre from Goodwill or Walmart or something. Bri seemed really upset by this‚Äìshe asked if I could just purchase the size I am now and have it be loose at the wedding. I told her I plan on being almost 60 pounds lighter by the wedding, so the dress won‚Äôt be loose‚Äìit will literally fall off. Bri asked then if I could slow down my weight loss until after the wedding so the dress would fit. I told her absolutely not. I feel amazing and I‚Äôm already losing at a slow and steady pace.

I presented Bri with three solutions: 1‚ÄìI can wait to buy the dress until closer to the wedding, as I requested, 2‚Äìshe can buy me the dress now with her money, or 3‚ÄìI drop out of the bridal party, since she probably has people she‚Äôs closer with than me anyway. Bri did not seem keen on any of these options‚Äìeven removing me from the bridal party. She told me I was ruining her big day and that it‚Äôs about her, not me, so why does it matter if I wear a dress that‚Äôs a little loose?

I hung up after that to give Bri some time to cool off, but then I got a call from my mother telling me what a horrible sister I was and how selfish I was for not just ordering the bridesmaid‚Äôs dress. She reiterated how it‚Äôs Bri‚Äôs day, not mine, and when I have my own wedding I can do things exactly how I want.

To be truthful, I am finally starting to feel confident and to like how I look. Before I started losing weight, I wouldn‚Äôt have cared if I wore a too-loose dress because I was ‚Äúfat and ugly‚Äù anyway. Now, even though I only buy dirt-cheap clothes, I make sure to buy clothes that flatter me and accentuate my curves. I put a lot more effort into hair, makeup, and overall presentation. So yes, even though it is not my wedding, this will probably be the first formal event I go to after having lost weight, and I know lots of pictures will be taken. I want to look my best for these photos because I know I will look back on them and remember how hard I worked to get there.

16,1f0h4cs,AITA for refusing to give back the laptop my mother gave me to punish younger sister,"I (23f) am starting grad school this year. My laptop recently broke and I couldn't afford a good one, my mother said my little sister (16f) has been ""acting up"" recently and not listening and she'd like to give me her laptop since ""she's been horrible lately.""

Now my mother tends to spoil her so it is her fault my sister turned out this way (ofcourse she'll hear none of it), she has a bad habit of not following through on punishments and ""canceling"" them when my sister pitches enough of a fit. 

I asked my mom ""are you absolutely sure you aren't going to call me later and ask for it back when she pitches a fit? Because if I'm gifted this I'm not giving it back unless you buy me one of equal or greater value."" She said ""yes I'm sure I've had enough of her antics"" so I went over and picked up the laptop when sister wasn't home and that was that or so I thought. 

It only took about a day before my mother called me begging for the laptop back because my sister has become unbearable and I said ""are you going to buy me one of equal or greater value?"" And she just kept begging for me to bring it back she couldn't stand it anymore, I told her no she never follows through on disciplining sister and its her fault the way she turned out its about time she followed through on a consequence and I'm not giving it back we had this discussion, and it's her fault for dragging me into this in the first place. She then screams at me and hung up and now won't speak to me. 

Dad always gives into whatever mom wants ""happy wife happy life"" and is telling me to ""be the bigger person"" and give it back, and I said I'm sticking to my guns and he's sent me several nasty texts and emails because now mom is on his case and he can't stand it and he's saying it's all my fault and this had just hugely blown up.

17,1f0gol2,WIBTA Would I be the ah if I changed my daughter‚Äôs name?,"I‚Äôm not sure if my ex uses Reddit or if this would get back to him but frankly his opinion means nothing to me now and I want other outside, unbiased opinions. 

My ex and I tried for five months to get pregnant. Almost as soon as we were successful (it took several months) I noticed a SIGNIFICANT change in him. Almost overnight it was like he stopped being happy, treated every request I made like a massive burden, started being an absolute jerk toward me, stopped communicating, stopped showing any affection etc. When I brought up concerns I was met with being called selfish, having my past thrown in my face, yelling, and slamming doors. At 19 weeks pregnant he ended things with me stating that his police officer training was causing him a lot of stress and that he‚Äôd like to just focus on FTO (field officer training) and then focus on our daughter once she arrives. He‚Äôs done next to nothing to support me while pregnant because ‚Äúshe isn‚Äôt even here yet.‚Äù This included him not caring when I told him I was sick, or in the ER. He‚Äôs since lied to family about what has been happening and even changed or added additional excuses as to why he left. Frankly I think he‚Äôs been cheating and a lot of people have drawn the same conclusion. He says he didn‚Äôt but after leaving the way he did I don‚Äôt feel like I can trust anything he says. 

ANYWAY. I had a long list of names I‚Äôd always wanted for a little girl but he didn‚Äôt like any of them. We finally settled on a name that wasn‚Äôt on my list but both were okay with. I always wanted a unique name for my daughter. The name we chose is pretty but not unique at all. 

Since he‚Äôs no longer in the picture (but says he will be when she gets here) my best friend asked me if I was going to change her name to one of the ones I wanted. I‚Äôm only 22 weeks pregnant now so there is plenty of time, but I know he‚Äôs going to be upset if I change her name. My mom sees nothing wrong with it but obviously my family isn‚Äôt his biggest fan so they‚Äôre a little biased. I do want to note that I do not want to change her name out of spite. He wasn‚Äôt even super set on it, it wasn‚Äôt like it held any special meaning or anything to him, he just hated all my other name suggestions. 

So Reddit, would I be the AH? 

EDIT: The names I like aren‚Äôt crazy or spelled weird. Since he‚Äôll know this is me for sure if it gets back to him I‚Äôll just say that I‚Äôve always loved the name Charlie for a girl (ever since watching Friends) or older names like Nora. 

Also for those asking, she will have my last name. And yes I know a lot of people want to say we should have been married, but I had been married before and can tell you that to some people it is just a piece of paper. If people want to bail, they can bail. However, I‚Äôm 30 years old and a veteran so my body is quite literally falling apart. We‚Äôd agreed to get married but I wasn‚Äôt in a rush to plan another wedding or spend all that money (I wanted to do a destination wedding).",Not the A-hole,2024-08-24,"WIBTA Would I be the ah if I changed my daughter‚Äôs name?

18,1f0gi9x,AITA for leaving my mom for good?,"


Hello everyone I wanted to make this since I wanna leave but my mother refuses to let me. So im 18f and my mom (we will call Luna) is 37F. Me and Luna dont really have a good relationship and we dont talk at home she barely says any words to me,she usally leaves me at home alone for a few days and goes out with my step dad. During my chillhood Luna was not the mom at all to me, she barely took care of me, my grandma had to take care of me whenever Luna left me with her, i love my grandma alot, she is like a mother to me because she was the one always bringing me to school, dressing me up ect, so we are really close. SO I work at gas station and ive been saving money for the past year I work at go to school so im pretty exhausted when I come home.

So yesterday I told my Luna, I am moving to ireland forever and I do not want a relationship with her anymore, she was not happy about it at all she got really mad at me saying,I need her in my life, I cant leave, she owns my life and my money,I need to take care of her and her bills and everything.  Saying how will I even get a job there (I researched everything and I did find a job and a place to stay there,since my godfather lives there, he said I could stay with him until I find my own place to stay). When I told her that i can stay there and survive. Luna started threatening me saying she will take all of my money,make me quit my job and take my phone awat if I decide to leave,since im not allowed?? (I know I can since I am an adult rn ig?) AND saying more means things to me how can I leave my own mother,since she took care of me all of my life and this is how i repay her(sure). I have to admit I just snapped and started yelling at her that she is not my mother she barely took care of me and I will do what I want with my life.  She cannot control me at all and what I do anymore, I sajd I will cut all my relationship with her after I leave and I did kinda push her because she was yelling at me straight into my face.

Now she is complaining to all of my family members that I am a horrible daughter for leaving her and her family. Half of the family is on my moms side saying I should take care of her since I have too because she gave birth to me. Tho my godfather and my grandma are saying that I can do what I want with my life and they will support my desicion.

Now idk what to do, I feel bad that i might be making a wrong desicion, I do love her yes but I also dont want to talk to her or see her for making my life difficult. I just wanna leave this toxic place

For context, I've had a few relationships before, and most of them ended up in a mess, I got cheated on, lied to, and things have been hidden for me. (This is important later)
So much that I've stablished certain rules for myself, never forgive any cheating, any lie, or any secret that involves me, and I've told her this even before we stablished ourselves as a couple, so she es pretty aware abot it

Important to clarify that I don't expect to know everything that's going on with my GF, she has right for her privacy, and I think I do as well, so I wont expect to know everything and every single detail about her talks or her friendships, I trust her and I know she trusts me.

Now into the issue, last night we were chiilin in her place, talking and trying to decide what to order for dinner, as we were watching options on her phone, a text came up, it was her cousin, the text was something along the lines of ""I send it here instead of tagging you, in case your bf could see it and cause troubles""

Immediately she tried to close it, and act like nothing happened, of course I mentioned it to her, she got all defensive, and said it wasn't for me to see, and tried to keep her cellphone away.
That's when alarms started sounding in my head ans thought she was hiding something really bad (I know I let my past trauma got the worst of me, but I wasn't thinking straight)
Immediately I got up from the bed, and started going through the door, I didn't want to fight, or figure out what was all about. She grabbed my arm and started apologizing, said she just got nervous and didn't want me to feel ofended.

In the end, it was just a dumb meme about something my gf and I had discussed about, It wasn't a major issue, but it was personal enough that I wouldn't want her cousin, best friends or anyone know about.
Now I know it wasn't that big of a deal, or that big of a secret, but the thing is that she tried to hide it, knowing I that's something I don't accept. I've tried to forgive her, since it wasn't that bad. But something inside me won't come around, so I've been really cold and distant today.

Now I know it wasn't that big of a deal, or that big of a secret, but the thing is that she tried to hide it, knowing I that's something I don't accept. I've tried to forgive her, since it wasn't that bad. But something inside me won't come around, so I've been really cold and distant today.

23,1f0g0ex,AITA? I yelled at my husband‚Äôs brother and he moved away,"To preface this story, I (f21) have a baby and had just gotten all of my wisdom teeth taken out two days prior, I was in a lot of pain. We live with my husband‚Äôs (m20) mom due to some pretty crappy stuff that happened.

My husbands brother decided to stay the night in the room next to us with his girlfriend. I was excited to hang out all 4 of us. There wasn‚Äôt much hanging out sadly so me and my husband stayed in our room after I had put the baby to bed. I played my switch for a little bit and then decided to go to bed. Fast forward to 1:40 am, and I see the light come on in the bathroom that‚Äôs connected to our room. Our quiet dark space for our baby to sleep suddenly became loud and bright. I check the time and am like oh they probably just had to pee or something. THEN I hear the shower come on. Mind you, it‚Äôs connected to our room and the walls are thin, it is LOUD. His girlfriend is in there dropping soaps, coughing, just generally being loud. The baby started squirming around. I could not deal with it in the pain I was in on top of the exhaustion and my husband couldn‚Äôt either bc he just got out of the hospital after a bad motorcycle accident. Finally I had enough and snuck out our door to see wtf was going on. I saw his brother and started flipping out and questioning why he thought it was okay to say his girlfriend could take a shower in our bathroom at 2 in the morning with a baby sleeping and people needing to recover from surgery. How they were there ALL DAY and decided to wait until 2 am. If she needs a shower take her to her house and let her wake her own parents up. He wouldn‚Äôt have had her use his mom‚Äôs bathroom so why was it okay to use mine? He looked really upset and honestly afraid. The last thing I said was get your girlfriend out or I will. They left that night and he ended up moving back with his dad and couple days after. AITA?

24,1f0fxr1,WIBTA if I didn't want my boyfriends sister in law around him? ,"I (f25) have been with my boyfriend Hunter (m29) for three years now. We were online friends for a while before that, and one say spoke about 'most embarrassing thing you have done"", and his was trying to hold his sister in laws hand, because he had a crush on her, on her wedding day. Hunter has three brothers, the oldest of which is married to Amy. The brother and her are now 40ish. The incident was ten years ago.

Amy and her family live in her country, they come to visit my boyfriends parents once a year, sometimes Amy doesn't come because she has to work, but she talks with Hunters mom once a week and so does their child. I obviously don't like her coming, she is generally nice and everyone likes her, she is a little fake I feel, always complimenting and positive, but nothing suspicious. But Hunter becomes strange around her, blushing when she complimented his hair style, eager to go on walks with the family.

One time, she cooked and I told her about my allergies. Hunter, unprovoked, told her she shouldn't worry, there is probably nothing in the food. I asked him later what that was, and he said, she looked worried and she always cares about such things, so he wanted to calm the situation. Amy hadn't even said anything, only afterwards she said, ""I don't want to endanger you, please give me a list."" He talked like he knows her character so well...

Well, they are coming again in two weeks and I asked Hunter to go on a vacation with me in that time, but he says he wants to spend time with his nephew and favourite brother. I asked him, if he also wants to spend time with Amy, and he said, it's nice that she is coming, but the main focus is his nephew.

I feel like I have a good reason not to want to stay in the same house as his (former or current) crush?

27,1f0fuax,AITA For telling my sister that her new boyfriend can't bring his child to my wedding?,"Me (F33) is getting married soon (Nov 2024) which has been planned for the last 2 years. My sister (F36) has just split with her husband and started a new relationship with one of her colleagues (We will call him Brandon) who I have briefly met a couple times before but don't know very well, he's nice enough but my FH has never met him and like I say I don't really know him myself.

My sister mentioned to Brandon that she is my maid of honour and that I will be getting married in November within the first week of their new relationship. before my sister and her husband (lets call him Rhys) split they were both invited to the wedding, as they'd been married for 15yrs so Rhys was a big part of the family.

Brandon automatically assumed he was invited to the wedding in Rhys' place, which I didn't like but sort of accepted that she'd want a plus one, and Rhys wouldn't want to come now anyway given the situation, so I let it go. she then informs me that Brandon has told his daughter Kelly (F10) who he co-parents with his ex that they're both coming to my wedding so Kelly is really excited.

I reminded my sister that we are having a 'child free' wedding which was communicated to everyone who was invited to attend, as we ourselves don't have children, don't want children and so don't want children at our wedding which all our family and friends have been fine with.

I've met Kelly, and she is unfortunately a complete brat, and definitely not a child we would want at our wedding regardless of if we're having a child free wedding or not. My sister thought our refusal was down to the cost of adding her as a guest when we've already reached maximum numbers, so initially offered to pay for her place.

I told her it's not about the money but because firstly I don't like Kelly and secondly Brandon overstepped by assuming his child could come without even trying to talk to myself and my FH first. I also calmly told her that she knew we were having a child free wedding and should have told him straight away to avoid this happening. As it's also not fair to our other friends and family members who have arranged childcare for their own children to respect our wishes.

She's now calling me an AH because it's 'going to make things difficult' for her when she tells him that he can't bring Kelly as she's excited about going to a wedding. I told her that wasn't my problem as I am not responsible for him trying to muscle in on a family event he wasn't even invited to in the first place.

I've offered to talk to him for her, to keep the peace, but she said I'd just end up being 'more of an AH to him' than I am already for telling her that her new boyfriends child can't come to my wedding.

About a month ago we were all hanging out playing poker, smoking, and drinking. She didn't partake in any of it. After a while, my friend got a Lil too fucked up and went to lay down.

During this time, the talk between his wife and I turned from relationship stuff to their sex life, I didn't stop it because I wanted to try and give advice that could've been useful for their relationship. Eventually she decided it was ok to show me pictures and videos of their intimate life. I'll admit I was drunk and horny so I didn't say anything about it then. 

But I'm now conflicted if I should tell him or not (a similar situation has happened in the past). I want him to know the truth, but I don't want to destroy their Marriage or our friendship. I'm stuck and I need some clarity of what to do. So reddit, wibta if I didn't tell him?",,1.0260010957717896,1,0
31,1f0fna3,AITA for calling out the loud mouth guy in line?,"Standing in line in the school hallway with many other families waiting to check my kids into/register for school.  A guy a couple people in front of me is going on and on about weed - loudly.   And he reeks of it.  I've smoked for decades and have no issue with it.  I do have an issue with the young siblings of students in line having to hear about it.  I leaned forward, tapped him on the arm, and asked him to lower his voice.

He reacted by screaming at me that he could not be quiet as he lost hearing fighting in Iraq.  The woman in his party of 5 or 6 physically leads him to turn away from me.  I'm standing there with what probably looks like a holy shit expression on my face as I'm trying to register what just happened,  and asked the 20ish guy directly in front of me (and part of the screamers group) if the screamer knew it was the subject that was an issue and not the volume.

The other full grown man of the group then started screaming at me asking me why I'm talking to them.  Says ""Where is your husband?  You don't get to talk to me!  You have him or your sons talk to me!""  Again, same lady intervenes  and physically directs him to face forward.

This is an all-boys, military/college-prep school (not the kind where troubled kids are sent) where boys develop 'character' and become leaders.

Am I the asshole?  Should I have just kept my mouth shut?  Because I am totally baffled.  And no one else said a damn word about these big, tall men screaming in my face because I didn't want all the drug talk in front of kids.  WTF?  Seriously.

32,1f0fb5l,AITA for asking my friend not to touch my long hair without permission?,"Posting this from another account.
I (19F) live with my friend (20F).
I have quite lush long hair, I don't really like how it looks with hairdo with tail or plaid (I do it only when I am eating), also I have very big ears, and I don't like how I look when the hair doesn't cover the ears.
Today we were watching a video with my friend. I was standing with loose hair (like on one of these photos: luxyhair.com/cdn/shop/articles/LuxyHair_16X9_Blog_70dc7d00-694e-4c68-8163-7a6e696b1ba7.jpg?v=1540475756), my friend was standing next to me, and I turned my head down because I am much taller than her.
So I touched her face with my hair by accident, I didn't notice that. And she put behind my ear the part of my hair which was touching her, and she had wet fingers, because of that it was even more unpleasant for me.
After that she told me that she hadn't been able to watch the video because of my hair, I apologised (I hadn't noticed that) and said I would try not to interfere her with my hair, but then I said that in these cases it would be MUCH better to tell me about that, I would just apologise and put it behind my ear by myself, and it is quite unpleasant when other people put my hair behind my ear without asking me about that.
She said she thinks she did nothing wrong, and I am the AH for not putting my hear behind my ear before coming to her and being uncomfortable with her doing that instead of telling me.
But I think she shouldn't have put my hair behind my ear (especially with wet fingers) instead of asking me.

33,1f0faok,AITAH For NOT reaching out to someone i believe could be my SISTER?,"Okay to start off my (21F) parents(42F and 43M) split up when I was less than a year old. My mom moved on a few short years later and had my younger brother (17M). My dad on the other hand would have multiple girlfriends throughout the years but never had any other children than me (or so we thought). A few years back when I was probably 16/17 my cousin who‚Äôll I‚Äôll call Cousin Ma (bc growing up she was like a mother to me and I don‚Äôt want to name call just incase someone I know is reading this) pulled me to the side to share some information with me she believed I should know. To sum up what she said was pretty much she believes my dad has possibly TWO DAUGHTERS out in the wild (not literally) from two different women. Both of which are supposed to be younger than me. I was shocked when she told me this but I thought she was just playing around at first and wasn‚Äôt actually serious. So I kept it to myself for a while. I constantly thought about what it would be like if I could have a sister (or two). Growing up my brother and I were raised like full siblings, no one ever said anything about him being my half brother. So hearing I possibly had two half sisters out there somewhere was wild to me. We‚Äôll come to find out they weren‚Äôt ‚Äòsome where out there‚Äô but in the same small town I live in. And when I mean small, I mean SMALL. I probably graduated with at most 100 people in my high school class. This was a town where everyone knows everyone and everyone knows your secrets (except this one obvi) so I eventually went to my dad about it to see if it was true, bc Cousin Ma hadn‚Äôt told me much information about my possible two sisters. When I told my dad he was a little taken back but then told me the full story. So a couple years after my parents broke up my dad tried seeing other women. Before I go on I should preface that my dad didn‚Äôt makes the best decisions back in the day. My dad starting seeing this woman we‚Äôll call R who also was recently out of a relationship and also had a young son. My dad and R fooled around for a little bit but then she got back with her ex (or was seeing the both of them at the same time) And tried to get into the military. Well if you didn‚Äôt know when you‚Äôre a woman and want to join the military you have to take a pregnancy test before you can go in and woah an behold she was pregnant. But instead of telling her then boyfriend that she had been with my dad, said that the baby was his. My dad never knew about this until many years later. So when he told me this I went and found R on Facebook saw she had many other children after the daughter that could possibly be my sister.

34,1f0f6e2,AITA for Trying to Improve my Roommate's Wellbeing?,"I (25M) am currently sharing a house with a friend (21M), let's call him Oscar, and quite a few more people to help keep the lights on. Most of my roommates are slightly younger than me and, to my knowledge, are enrolled in a college or university, so I try to keep the house in order (chores, rent, etc.) when they're busy with their studies since I have plenty of time off work. We're all pretty close after having lived together for a while, so I often check in with everyone to see how they're doing. 

So, this is where Oscar comes in. He's always been a bit shy; I consider myself to be the closest to him out of the rest of our roommates. I even helped him open up to everyone when we all first started living here a little over an year ago. From what I've seen, Oscar seems to struggle a lot with his depression, which is fine, no judgement here, but I worry for him and try to help him out the best I can because he's a friend who I care about deeply. I personally do morning workouts and Oscar usually joins me if he doesn't have classes that day. I used to be the one encouraging him to do so at first, but now he joins voluntarily. I also generally just give him words of advice and encouragement, and it'd always seem to put him in a better mood whenever he was feeling down. For the past month, It even felt like he had improved mentally. 

  
At least, that's what I thought. I recently accidentally caught him talking with another one of our roommates (19F), let's call her Fatima, about how I approach his depressive behavior. I'm not the biggest fan of their friendship; Fatima is a nice person, but it often feels like she encourages Oscar's poor thoughts, pries into his feelings, or enables his behavior (but that might just be my POV as a close friend of his). So, basically what I overheard was that Oscar tried to be in a good mood around me, but felt like he couldn't meet my expectations and it made him feel even worse about himself. Fatima agreed with Oscar and told him he could vent about his depression to her. It was as if Oscar hadn't gotten better at all. The two laughed a lot together in their conversation; Oscar had never smiled like that with me. I know it's not my job to make him happy, but seeing them together did hurt a bit. I'm upset that my words couldn't reach Oscar in a way that genuinely made him happier. I never expected anything from him, all I wanted was for him to feel better. Though, with what I know now, I think my efforts might have ended up being in vain.

37,1f0esy5,AITA for telling my dad he made his own mess and I'm not helping him with it?,"My dad is a fucked up mess. He and my mom were together for 7 years, high school sweethearts and everything, when mom found out she was pregnant with me. He says he freaked out and cheated on her because he was scared of being a father. But he regretted it after the third time of sleeping with this other woman and thought he could leave it behind. He proposed to my mom and she accepted. Then when mom was 7 months pregnant with me the other woman showed up and said dad got her pregnant. My mom called off the engagement. 

From that mess dad has me (18m) and Staci (17f).

The other woman wanted a relationship with dad but he said he only ever loved and wanted my mom, she was a mistake, baby was a mistake. Mom didn't want him back. Dad ended up with 50/50 custody of me and Staci. Her mom tried for maybe 2 years it sounds like to get back with dad, even told my mom she was selfish for keeping dad from her. Then she gave up. Dad pined for mom for years and tried to win her back. It pissed Staci off. Staci was already pissed because her mom told her dad chose mom over them and me and mom over them. So she had a chip on her shoulder with me and my mom. When she was waaaay too young to be saying crap she was calling my mom degrading insults. My dad would get so mad when Staci talked to mom that way and dad would tell mom he was sorry, he'd make it work, please, he only ever loved her, etc. This was going on when I was old enough to remember witnessing this pathetic mess.

I was 11 when dad moved on and finally let mom go. He met a woman, married her and had Georgie (6) with her. Staci was furious that dad fell in love with someone else other than her mom, that instead of falling in love with her mom ""again"" he found someone after he let go of mom... after 11 years. So Staci hates Georgie and she treats her like shit. Dad's wife died when Georgie was only 3 and Staci has said some really twisted shit about her to Georgie. Also to me because I got along okay with my dad's late wife.

I have mostly noped out of it all now. But I answer occasional calls from dad. He said he wanted to get the family together when we talked yesterday and that he wants us to be close. He needs my help. That we can't continue with the toxic mess. I told him he made his own mess and I'm not helping him with it. That he needs to take accountability and stop making it worse.

My mom had a few boyfriends over the years, but nothing serious that lasted long
She didn‚Äôt date for years until my sister and I became young adults, and she wasn‚Äôt busy raising little kids.
She started dating this guy, and we got along fine in the beginning. But things started to change in ways I can‚Äôt explain. Maybe I‚Äôm just not used to living with a man? My whole life all I remember is just me, my mom, and sister. So when a man started living there, it was different
My mom and I kept fighting, she kicked me out last summer and I‚Äôve been living with my bf and his family ever since
I also got into a huge screaming match with her bf because I was mad I heard them having sex one morning 
Anyway, my whole family loves him and accepted him immediately and expected me too as well. They even tried getting me to get him a Father‚Äôs Day card, but I refused 

Eventually I got back on okay terms with my family, but I feel a physical barrier between me and them.

40,1f0ehdz,AITA for distancing from a work colleague?,"I'm navigating an awkward relationship with a recent colleague at work. Let's call him X.

I took a liking to him, when he arrived, as he went through trouble in the past and was on leave for 5 years.

Since then we kind of bonded and lunched together frequently for a few weeks.

Lately, I started distancing myself from him due to many factors, and **I would like to know if I am in the right or if I am acting like a shitty person**:

- I'm not in my usual mood. My parents are going through a rough patch. So I'm focusing on people I mesh with greatly.

- We had another arrival at work, so I wanted to do a lunch altogether with coworkers to welcomehim. We had set a time, however X wanted to stay behind to finish some work, even though nothing was urgent. Everybody had to wait, then got impatient and left. When he finally joined in, the others were seated in another place than previously discussed. X got pissy about it, said he wanted to stay where we were and the new recruit had to tag along with just the 2 of us.

- X recounted a story about his school days; he mocked a teacher and drove her upset because she was from a different religion than he is. I dislike talking about religion, and did't like that side of him.

- A coworker remarked we looked ""cute"" together and she wanted to marry us. I don't appreciate these remarks and don't want that type of rumor attached to me. He's still a colleague.

- I was working on a hard case. It lasted 2 hours. X listened to my conversation with the client, and when I hang up the phone he says, in front of other colleagues that he heard unethical things and was wondering if he should report me. I denied it and he responded that he was joking. I am kind of susceptible on these remarks as I take pride in my work and go to great lengths to deliver results. I dropped it. When the client finally sent me an email confirming the deal, I felt proud of myself and shared the news with a colleague next to me. He says ""You know how kind you can come across if you thank the client?"". The colleague immediatly shut it down by saying I put a lot of time and resources already. I also responded in the same manner.

X got aggressive, told us the discussion was over as he wasn't engaging with us on this matter.

Right then and there, I decided to grey rock and keep my distance. I rejected multiple offers from him to go eat. When I offered to go as a group, he was adamant to go alone with me.

Except, people did notice this change in attitude and are suddenly growing wary of me as I am seen as the dude who's phasing out the new recruit. I am also suspecting he's speaking about me to them, as they are coming to ""check on him"" and see if he's doing good. And are avoiding me, in the process.

I told Jamie that if he didn‚Äôt clean his room by the end of the week, I would donate his toys to charity. Of course, he didn‚Äôt take me seriously and continued to leave his room in a mess. When the deadline passed, I followed through and donated his entire toy collection to a local children‚Äôs charity.

Little bro (25M) doesn't talk much (and never did really) but he's real experienced in his crafts and I admire him. He's basically our little baby. I'll call him Al in this post. 
Ok, the way this whole thing happened is.. we went to get poutine and I was gonna upload a photo of it on my social media. (it looked like us!) The lady who served us told us they LOVE people like us in Canada- so we were really happy about this, until we found out.. people don't really like us. Hell, apparently we're immigrants? (We're not, we've lived here since we were little.) 
We started streaming for our small community (everyone who hates us was bound to see it.) to make them be happy (as per G's idea) but it backfired, because the stream did so bad it.. kind of ruined the entire Wi-Fi for the community. None of them could use anything, so they ended up hating us harder. 
Well, they started tracking us down. We stayed at a friend's home for a bit until my brothers wanted me to come with them, because they were going to Canada instantly, but.. I thought they were crazy. Even if we were criminals (not), I'm not gonna live my birthplace. I have memories and friends here, I couldn't do it. But my friend was a little too weird when he heard I'm staying here (he's my best friend, sometimes he just gets unbearable though) so I instantly went with my brothers.
When our car broke down, I couldn't do it anymore. I snapped at G. I told him that, over and over, we get into trouble because of his schemes, then everything ends up worse. He said he was the only one trying to get us out of this mess, and I said he created it. When I said it was his fault for creating that stream, he began being egoistic as per usual. It was getting pretty heated, So Al (bless his little heart) started hiding out of fear. I told G to see what he did, and he told me that playing the blame game won't do anything. G didn't get it that he can't fix this. We'll never be able to be free. When I stormed off, G asked me ""where are you going we can't leave we have to stick together we're brothers blah blah blah"" 
This is where I think I was being an AH. I told him we're not brothers. I told him we're just a bunch of dumb people who made up some story to make ourselves feel better. Al and G looked at me immediately. (We don't look the same, by the way. I'm white&asian, G is black, and Al is white. Pretty hard to tell that we're brothers.)

Z seemed chill and we were friendly. When we got to college, she started talking on the phone with her boyfriend and parents constantly. Like it was for hours every day in our dorm. Z also started acting kinda distant. She found a new group of friends, and refused to ever hang out or talk to me. I'll call her friends ""M"" and ""D."" 

I asked Z if she's mad at me or uncomfortable. She said no and that she's just trying to ""branch out and meet new people/network."" Shortly after that, Z introduced me to M and D. We had a movie night in their dorm. It was great. We also walked around by the beach, and went to the movie theater. Her friends seemed super sweet, and I liked them. Then out of nowhere, Z and her friends completely stopped inviting me to go out with them.  

After this, Z also had M and D stay in our dorm for a couple nights because their AC was broken. They kinda just all ignored me and acted like I was invisible. I have no idea why they're doing this. I was always really nice, but I guess I'm just awkward or something? I'm also getting super frustrated because now Z is starting to constantly invite M and D over to our dorm with no heads up for me.

M and D are always there for hours every day. They're sweet, but it's kinda starting to get annoying. They constantly watch tik toks on their phones with no earbuds and talk really loud. It is literally impossible to study in my own room because of this. Today was especially bad....M and D slept over and just laid on the floor watching tik tok until like 11 AM. Then they left for a bit, came back, and left again. They just came back again now, and they're being super annoying. 

Another thing that I'm annoyed about is the fact that Z occasionally comes home super late and wakes me up on school nights. I tried addressing it with her, but she just said she's already trying to be quiet. And whenever M and D stay for the night, they get home even later than Z. 

I was talking to my friend about this, and she said I'm being ""too harsh."" She said that Z, M, and D are just acting like this because they're freshmen, and they're still trying to get adjusted to college. I'm also a freshman, but I feel like they should know better than this. I'm honestly starting to resent both my roommate and her friends, but I don't want to go through the hassle of moving to a different room and finding a new roommate. I feel really alienated, and I almost feel like ""Z"" thinks the whole dorm just belongs to her, not us. 

Edit: Forgot to clarify, but M and D live in a completely different dorm building. They aren't my suitemates or anything like that.


Edit 2: I also forgot to mention another big issue. A while ago, Z literally asked me if her boyfriend could come sleep over for the night. She was planning for her boyfriend to just sleep in her bed. She asked me if I'm fine with that. I obviously said no and that I'm uncomfortable.

49,1f0d0nh,AITA for eating dinner without consulting my brother?,"I suggested to my little brother that we order sushi for dinner as our parents aren‚Äôt home. He agrees.

He ordered the sushi at 19:15 (our parents are paying). He requested I pick it up at 19:45. Sushi couldn‚Äôt be delivered because he said it would take too long and he has to prepare for his party at 21:00 at our house.

He left the house at approximately 19:30 to go to the local liquor store (about five minutes from our home) and buy some booze with his friend, who was also invited. He told me about this beforehand.
I pick up the sushi at ~19:55 and get home at 20:10. He and his friend aren‚Äôt home. 

I wait for about ten minutes before dividing the sushi in half and eating my portion. I end up eating 40% of the total and leave the rest for him. He arrives home with his friend at 20:30, right after I finish eating.

He greets me and notes that I ate quite a lot of the sushi. He asks how much, and I say ~40%.

This angers him, as he says that he, his friend and me were each meant to eat a third. I respond that I did not know that his friend was going to eat too, as they arrived at our house far after what is considered dinnertime here (19:00) and I thought his friend had already eaten dinner before then.

He says that I should‚Äôve consulted with him before eating and gets very angry at me. I told him that if we were going to share our dinner with an unexpected third party, he should‚Äôve informed me beforehand. 

He is of the opinion that I should‚Äôve texted or called him before eating, to ask if his friend wanted to eat too. I refrained from doing this because my little brother rarely ever picks up his phone and I didn‚Äôt want to interrupt him.

For context, my little brother is 18 and I am 19.

I knew someone who would go and tell me they loved me one moment and that they hated me the next. They would go and tell everyone that they could that I was a terrible person, but had no actual valid reason for saying that about me (I mean this as in I didn‚Äôt actually mean to do anything to hurt them). Once they were done doing that, they‚Äôd tell me all about how they ‚Äúaccidentally made someone hate me‚Äù again.

I knew they had really struggled mentally for the longest time and would try to be understanding because I too, had had issues (terrible anxiety and depression). I did everything in my power to try and make them happy, but they would still be unhappy no matter what I did. I would get screamed at and told that they hated me almost every day.

It got to a point where I couldn‚Äôt handle them anymore because trying to help them was hurting me so badly. I told them how I felt and that I still loved them but they lost it and I felt terrible, but I was just too tired to deal with it.

Another person (a friend of mine) who was also very close with them expressed how they felt about the way they were treated in a comment under one of my social media posts. I knew it wasn‚Äôt the nicest thing and that I should probably delete it, but my people pleasing, idiotic self liked it instead. I thought it wouldn‚Äôt matter because the person it was about was blocked on everything so they wouldn‚Äôt see it. Not only that, but their name was never even said in the comment. I then completely forgot all about the comment (THIS IS IMPORTANT)

I found out much later what bpd was and it sounded A LOT like them so I started researching and wanted to tell them that they should get checked for it. I couldn‚Äôt contact them though because there was literally no way of doing so.

Now, remember when I said I forgot about the comment? The person it was about somehow found it despite being blocked, sent a screenshot of it to my friend who said it, and started saying that she and I were both childish because they only did those things they did due to their now diagnosed bpd. 

I think I am the A-hole here because I now know that a lot of how they treated my friend and I, was just due to how much they were hurting. I also now realize how much that comment could have hurt them and that I should have deleted it right away.

This all happened 2 weeks ago. My friend 26F and me 25F have been friends for about years now. We met at our gap year job and we bonded over the fact we both happened to go to Comic Con that one weekend. We started talking about fandoms, franchises and have been great friends ever since. I'm an avid cosplayer and even pulled her into the Cosplay scene where she met even more friends and even her after they both helped me out at my booth on Comic con. 

I have been in the cosplay scene for 10 years now and 5 years ago I started a Cosplay Repair booth. . It's 3 full days of 10 hours or more having to be constantly available without breaks. It gets pretty exhausting on the 3rd day. But it's fun and rewarding work. She has happily helped out multiple times. 

Now 2 weeks ago I had a 3 day Anime event. It has anime raves on Friday and Saturday which last until 3am. Normally I skip these. Tho this year I decided to join my friends to the raves. And I admit on sunday I felt slightly hungover. 

My friend came on sunday to help her gf at the event. In the morning they came and dropped off some stuff and told me they would have cake at 4pm. I didn't think much of it at. Then at 3.30pm we were already cleaning up and she came by and asked if we would be there at 4 for cake. I told her I was extremely tired and really needed some sleep and really wanted to go home as soon as we cleaned up. She kind of stood there and then told me it was her birthday. She walked of crying and after going full panic mode I went to find her and apologise. She reacted very cold and understood I had to let her be for now. So 4 days after the con I send her msg again apologising. Didn't make up excuses didn't try and explain I just told her I understand how horrible it must be and just gave her a massive apology. She still reacted coldly and tbh rn I'm scared to send her another msg.

In the 6 years I have NEVER forgotten her bday, or any important day or celebration she had. I have ADHD which means I put EVERYTHING in my phone agenda. I try and battle the ADHD as much as I can because it's MY problem so I have to find a solution for it. She knows this and has been understanding about it ever since we became friends. But for some reason her bday wasn't in my phone and I don't know why. 

When I ask ppl about their thoughts on this they say they understand her but also think she might be overreacting  We always communicated. Always talked about frustrations and helped each other. So this is really catching me off guard.

54,1f0cbxq,AITA for putting rum in a sasparilla bottle?,"I (25f) go to a bunch of local fairs and festivals. One of my favorite vendors, that I've been going to since I was a child, is a sasparilla vendor. They sell homemade soda in really cool bottles that look like something from a pirate ship. Each year they have a limited run bottle for one festival in my hometown. The bottles usually have custom illustrated labels made to look like they're from the colonial period and have the year stamped into the glass. I have five of these bottles, which I have chosen to display in my dining/bar area alongside similarly interesting bottles like a jug of Kraken and a tequila skull. I thought they looked weird empty so I filled them with alcohols that I like to have on hand but don't like the bottles of.

Everyone who comes over is offered a drink from our kitchen, which contains no alcohol, or the bar, which is clearly an alcoholic area, despite the sasparilla bottles. 

Well, my boyfriend's parents came over for the first time and brought his two sisters, Lex(11) and Katie(9). The girls were shown where they could get drinks from in the kitchen and told that they are allowed to get them on their own, as long as they clear it with an adult first. This was a mistake.

We were all eating pizza in the living room, Katie went to get another drink, and then we heard hysterical crying coming from the dining room. Turns out, she wanted a drink from one of the pretty bottles on my bar instead, which contained spiced gold rum. She kept saying that the police were going to come get her and she wasn't calming down, despite everyone saying it was alright. Lex pointed out that the alcohol was in a root beer bottle and my in-laws then went off on me, asking why I wouldn't make it more obvious that the bottles contained alcohol if I knew children were coming over. 

My boyfriend took their side, saying it clearly says it's root beer and that it was easily confusable with soda. I tried saying that it was clearly a decorative bottle on a shelf with other alcohols and was shot down. My boyfriend has since removed all of the decorative bottles from my bar and put them in a cardboard box in the pantry. If I try to put a bottle back, it ends up back in the box. The whole thing has made me feel like crap just because I wanted to show off my collection and make it usable.

AITA?

I (25f) go to a bunch of local fairs and festivals. One of my favorite vendors, that I've been going to since I was a child, is a sasparilla vendor. They sell homemade soda in really cool bottles that look like something from a pirate ship. Each year they have a limited run bottle for one festival in my hometown. The bottles usually have custom illustrated labels made to look like they're from the colonial period and have the year stamped into the glass. I have five of these bottles, which I have chosen to display in my dining/bar area alongside similarly interesting bottles like a jug of Kraken and a tequila skull. I thought they looked weird empty so I filled them with alcohols that I like to have on hand but don't like the bottles of.

Everyone who comes over is offered a drink from our kitchen, which contains no alcohol, or the bar, which is clearly an alcoholic area, despite the sasparilla bottles. 

Well, my boyfriend's parents came over for the first time and brought his two sisters, Lex(11) and Katie(9). The girls were shown where they could get drinks from in the kitchen and told that they are allowed to get them on their own, as long as they clear it with an adult first. This was a mistake.

We were all eating pizza in the living room, Katie went to get another drink, and then we heard hysterical crying coming from the dining room. Turns out, she wanted a drink from one of the pretty bottles on my bar instead, which contained spiced gold rum. She kept saying that the police were going to come get her and she wasn't calming down, despite everyone saying it was alright. Lex pointed out that the alcohol was in a root beer bottle and my in-laws then went off on me, asking why I wouldn't make it more obvious that the bottles contained alcohol if I knew children were coming over. 

My boyfriend took their side, saying it clearly says it's root beer and that it was easily confusable with soda. I tried saying that it was clearly a decorative bottle on a shelf with other alcohols and was shot down. My boyfriend has since removed all of the decorative bottles from my bar and put them in a cardboard box in the pantry. If I try to put a bottle back, it ends up back in the box. The whole thing has made me feel like crap just because I wanted to show off my collection and make it usable.

AITA?

For context: his parents live in a newly built neighborhood with no set HOA yet but since moving in the family has been notified we cannot park cars on our side of the cul-de-sac and must park them across the street. His parents have a 1.5 car garage and 2 car drive way and here's the current driveway situation:

his mom parks in the garage (works 8-4)

his dad is in the driveway but not blocking his wife's car (works from home)

my BF works 6a-2p but will soon be starting 3rd shift 10pm-6am

I work 7a-2pish

My BF‚Äôs brother has special needs and his mom takes him to/from work and needs access to the driveway.

Due to my bf and I both coming home before his mom we don't park in the driveway so she can get in the garage and if we park two cars in the driveway behind one another we block the sidewalk. So me and my BF have been parking on the street we were told we could park on. About 2 weeks ago the neighbor in question (of whom have a 3 car garage and 3 car driveway) parked her car in the middle of the spot my bf and I usually park our cars.

My BF and I's previous house was also on a street with public parking/driveways and we never had a problem with any of our neighbors about parking in front of their houses (not in front of their driveways obviously). On garbage mornings we both leave well before the garbage trucks enter the suburb and all mail is delivered in a PO box at the suburbs entry, so no one has mailboxes. Anyways, so the neighbor parks in the middle of a spot where two cars can comfortably fit for about a week before moving their car back into their driveway and my bf and I start parking there again, still leaving room for both driveways (plus the cars are backing out into a cul-de-sac it‚Äôs really not that difficult).

My BFs mom responded essentially stating that we were told we could not park on our side of the cul-de-sac or in the actual cul-de sac and were directed to park on the left side of the street.

One day I get there and I realize instead of packing running shorts I packed an old pair of boxers by mistake. Obviously wasn't going to wear those but a friend of mine had some spare running shorts I could borrow, similar to the ones I usually wear. 

They're the fairly short ones with a brief liner, so you usually wouldn't wear underwear underneath. But since these weren't mine, I kept my underwear on. I get that I was washing them after so they'd be fine, but I made a split second decision.

My underwear was longer than the shorts, which admittedly looked kinda stupid. I tried to roll them up but it didn't work and eventually I gave up and they were poking out the bottom of the shorts pretty noticeably. 

Didn't think anything of it but the next day the head of the running club texted me saying multiple people told him they were uncomfortable. If I did it again I'd be banned. Is it that big a deal?

However, even though the doctor suggested liposuction to help with it, I decided against it as my quality of life wasn‚Äôt being affected badly enough for me to consider it my only option.

Now, my mother (46F) and I haven‚Äôt always had the best relationship, but it was never bad enough to where we‚Äôd dislike each other or go out of our way to hurt each other, but she often made (what I believed to be) unintentionally hurtful comments about my appearance, height, weight, fashion sense, hobbies, etc. However, she was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder at a young age and even with medication, it can still affect her sometimes so I chose to not take those comments to heart.

I also ask my friends if i showed her too much care or what, but they all agree with me that what she did is very delisional of her bcs where only been talking for a week and the flow of the conversation is very mutual, and she was the one who asked me for coffee. I hate that she's making me look like I'm so inlove with her. And she made notes on IG notes regarding the situation in her delusional POV.

So AITA for calling her a delusional and then leaving her on read. Bcs I do not have the energy to argue with her anymore. I'm not actually mad about this. This is actually so annoying it's making me laugh and feel speechless üò≠",,1.0064828395843506,1,0

63,1f0anhv,AITA for not checking my phone for one hour at my own party?,"I organised a party at my parents house because they were on holiday and I had the house to myself. I don't live in the city but rather on the Country-side. Which isn't as bad as it seems since I live in a very small country and even the country-side most of the time isn't too far away from the nearest city. Also the train connections are very good, we have 4 trains/hour going to the city during the day and by night (especially on week-ends) it goes down to 1 train per hour.

Still one of my friends who lives in the city decided to come by car. Which is fine, that's her decision to make.
At 7pm when the party started I plugged in my phone and left it in the living room while the guests who were already there and I went out in the garden. At that moment I saw a message from her ""I will be there at 7.30pm"" so I sent her a thumbs up as a response and went to talk with my friends.

At around 8pm I went back in to check my phone only to find 8 new messages from her and 3 missed calls. In the messages she said she didn't know where to park and she's now waiting outside my house and can't reach me. She waited for almost 30 minutes and then left again and went back home.

The road in front of my house is a very small and quiet road with almost no cars and if there are cars they're very slow because there's usually a bunch of children playing there. My friend could've just put her car on that road, get out of it and come ask me where she should park for real. Nothing would have happened if she did that. And there was also a Whatsapp group with all the people in there who were already at the party. She could have texted or even called the Whatsapp group and someone would have seen that message, told me and I could have gone to help her. Also since my parent took the car with them their usual parking spot was empty she could have just parked there and then come ask if that's okay like that.

And it‚Äôs my grandmother and grandfather‚Äôs money. She also pisses me off a lot, because she‚Äôs very selfish towards me. I am also mean to her, but that‚Äôs only because she treats me the same way. So here‚Äôs what happened, we were at the Zoo, and I was taking the pictures with my phone, I took 12 pictures of Anna and my cousin, and she was very mad because of that. After we got back home, she told me- not told me basically DEMANDED in the nicest way possible for me to send her the 12 pictures. I did, but when she was getting ready to leave she was being rude and bitchy, she told me that I am very selfish, and me being a child, unsent the pictures I sent her.

My sister, Lily (25F), has always been a huge dog lover, but she‚Äôs never had one of her own due to her small apartment and busy schedule. When I first got Rocky, Lily was ecstatic and would come over often to spend time with him. I didn‚Äôt mind at first; it was nice to see her so happy.

However, over the past few months, Lily‚Äôs visits have increased significantly. She‚Äôs been coming over almost every day, sometimes unannounced, and spending hours with Rocky. She even started referring to him as ""our dog"" and once introduced him to a friend as ""my dog."" It started to get uncomfortable when she began making decisions for Rocky, like buying him a different brand of food without asking me and scheduling vet appointments under her name.

I tried talking to her about it, suggesting that she might want to consider getting her own dog, but she brushed it off, saying she couldn't handle the responsibility. Last week, things reached a tipping point when I came home from work and found that Lily had taken Rocky to her place without asking. She claimed it was because she ""missed him"" and thought he needed a change of scenery.

I was furious and told her that while I appreciated how much she loved Rocky, she needed to respect that he‚Äôs my dog and that I‚Äôm the one responsible for him. I also told her she couldn‚Äôt take him without my permission and that her constant visits were starting to feel intrusive. Lily got really upset and accused me of being selfish and ungrateful for all the ""help"" she's been giving with Rocky.

Now, she‚Äôs barely speaking to me, and my parents are saying I overreacted and should be grateful that Lily loves Rocky so much. They think I should let her spend as much time with him as she wants, but I feel like my boundaries are being completely ignored.

(I learned about it from a podcast that reads the posts ‚Äì and I find I tend to agree with the insights/comments.) And now, I‚Äôd like some of those insights to be directed at my situation.¬†

I had been in a long-term relationship that was expected to be for life. Without warning, my boyfriend ended things and never looked back. I was utterly shocked and devastated, and spent the following months basically curled up in the fetal position and crying. When I say it came out of nowhere, that is not an exaggeration. We had a big trip planned for late August of this year (he left in May), and even have deposits down on a trip for the fall of 2025.¬†

At any rate, the trip we‚Äôd planned for August (I leave in four days) is a bit exotic ‚Äî going to a remote island in the South Pacific to swim with humpback whales. There is a very short window for this opportunity, and the island doesn‚Äôt have a lot of tourist infrastructure, so you need to plan far in advance and deposits are not refundable.¬†I had already put together the itinerary and reserved a hotel when my ex noped out of our life in May. I still wanted to go on the trip but was sad at the idea of going alone, so I invited my friend ‚ÄúLiz‚Äù to join.¬†¬†

Some background on Liz ‚Äî she has never had a job and lives off her alimony, which she constantly complains is not enough and is convinced she got screwed in her divorce. She‚Äôs been divorced for seven or eight years and spent half of that time (and a ton of money) appealing the divorce decision. She lost the appeals and is very bitter and insists the judge wasn‚Äôt fair, etc.¬†

I find it a bit annoying that she doesn‚Äôt think the alimony is enough to live off, yet she‚Äôs had seven years to get a job and supplement her income and hasn‚Äôt. Liz seems to think working is for suckers. Her ex-husband is pilot, so she still has amazing/free flight benefits and travels a lot ‚Äì usually six or more international trips, each of which lasts two or three weeks, every year. She meets A LOT of men and generally they go with her and pay for stuff. If she can‚Äôt find someone to cover the cost of her accommodations, she will stay in hostels for like $12/night until she finds a man in whatever country she's in. Liz is VERY cheap. Like painfully cheap. She has a general expectation that people should take care of her and that‚Äôs what tends to happen.¬†

When I invited her to join me on my trip, she predictably said she can‚Äôt afford it. I told her I‚Äôd cover the cost of the lodging because I‚Äôd already paid for it and frankly, it would be the same cost to me if I went alone or if she joined. I can afford a few thousand dollars for a decent resort, and there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm staying in a hostel. (We are both in our early 50s ‚Äî and I‚Äôm just too old to bunk up with random strangers.)¬†

Anyway, I had her at ‚Äúfree lodging‚Äù and she planned to join. She booked her whale swims, which are $300/day, and she reserved four days. After paying this non-refundable deposit, she learned the airline she has flight benefits on doesn‚Äôt fly to these islands. She‚Äôd have to first go to Australia (for free) and then buy a flight to the islands, which was an unexpected cost to her of about $900. Given the extra distance she had to fly, she decided to extend her trip and spend some time in Australia before joining me on the island.¬†

Liz has been complaining nonstop about how much this trip is costing her ($1200 to swim with whales + $900 flight), and it has made me feel like she‚Äôs not grateful and/or expects me to cover more of her trip, like meals and tips when we‚Äôre there. She has NEVER ONCE thanked me for covering the cost of her lodging and instead suggested she‚Äôs doing me a favor so that I don‚Äôt have to travel alone.¬†

I told her this trip is costing me more than twice as much as her and I‚Äôm going for half the time she is ‚Äî I have to pay for all of my flights and have a job I need to get back to. Then I reminded her I‚Äôm covering her lodging cost, and she could have saved money by 1. Only swimming with the whales for two or three days, or 2. Not extending her trip another week. She has also added on expenses like a spa appointment and other ‚Äòvacation-ey‚Äô things that most people on a budget probably would forgo (like pre-trip Botox).¬†

She freaked out when I pointed this out and told me I‚Äôm making her feel like a freeloader. It‚Äôs resulted in a pretty big tiff and we haven‚Äôt spoken since, other than to say we‚Äôll meet up on the island. She feels like she‚Äôs doing me a favor and it‚Äôs costing her money; I feel like I‚Äôve been generous, and she should make better budgeting decisions.¬†

For clarity, I have traveled to over 100 countries and often travel solo, so it‚Äôs not like I couldn‚Äôt manage a week alone. Yes, it is nice to have company, but not if all she‚Äôs doing is complaining about the cost of things and how put out she is by having to pay for herself.

My husband is the second one in charge in the department of the company he works, he started working there on the recommendation of a mutual friend of both of us, so everyone in that company knows me.

76,1f07ozn,AITA for telling my that I‚Äôm autistic,"In 10th grade I had 2 best friends, Ruby and Sharon. Ruby, Sharon and I were super close and told each other everything. For example Ruby told Sharon and I about her panic attacks and Sharon talked about the death of her mom with Ruby and I.

In 10th grade I started therapy because I was anxious and I thought I had ADHD. I told my friends that I thought that I had ADHD and they supported me. I told my therapist that I  wanted to get tested for ADHD and she wanted me to get tested for Autism too. Months later I got tested for ADHD and Autism. 

While waiting for my results I told my friends about my test and why I thought I was autistic. When I told them about my autistic traits they would say to me that they ‚Äúknow what autism is‚Äù. This confused me. because l wasn‚Äôt telling them what autism was I was telling them why I thought I was autistic. They were acting weird around me when I brought up autism and two weeks later I decided to ask them what was wrong. I stayed home from school one day and texted in our group chat asking what was wrong, they responded with a long message saying that ‚ÄúI was talking about being autistic too much and we all had our own problems‚Äù. I was shocked and I didn‚Äôt know how to respond to them. I didn‚Äôt respond immediately and took some time to think through what they said and how I wanted to respond so I wouldn‚Äôt respond defensively. 

The next day at school I continued to take some time to myself and sat with my other friends at lunch. After school I texted them  that I was sorry I didn‚Äôt respond and didn‚Äôt sit with them at lunch. I told them that I did that cause I was trying to think through my response. They told me that my actions upset and I apologized to them and asked them if we could talk. They said they would be willing to talk but they avoided me for the last two months of 10th grade. When we talked I told them once again why I did what I did, they doubled down and said that they knew what autism was and that I shouldn‚Äôt have done what I did.

I got my assessment results that summer and was diagnosed with ADHD and Autism. During summer we hung out as a group once. S and myself hung out a few times and talked about my Autism diagnosis and my experiences. 11th grade starts and I sit with my friends at lunch. At Lunch Ruby and Sharon ignored me and everything I would say. Eventually I invited some of my other friends to sit with me at lunch so I could have someone to talk.

At the start, I was very excited about finding out that the manga we'd been eyeing at had finally arrived at the store but when I saw the price I immediately worried about P's wallet as I knew all too well about their spending habits.

I 23F have been with my boyfriend 24M for 2.5 years. Before my period, in my luteal phase, I literally could not stop crying. I question my relationship, cry if he hasn‚Äôt messaged me for a while, and question myself. I never verbally express those negative intrusive thoughts to him because I‚Äôm aware it‚Äôs PMS and not valid.

I‚Äôve educated him about luteal phases and periods, but I wonder if it‚Äôs even my partner's responsibility to deal with me. I wrote him a list of simple things that would help me during my luteal phase and more complex ones if he has the time (writing long letters, planning a date).

This is usually a time when I am very clingy and need a lot of reassurance and his presence (whether it‚Äôs online because of LDR or in person). I am never toxic, although I call him crying often during this time to seek his comfort. He answers and makes me feel better, and then he obviously goes back to work.

I told him that I didn't know that and that I was sorry but that I would do better next time, whereupon he told me there wouldn't be a next time aka he wouldn't take my tent out again.

The whole time she was asking what was wrong with me and that I was overreacting, that it was far too early to be getting ready and that I was acting like a child which only pissed me off more.

I feel that she needs to learn respect for me and that she was purposely being difficult to upset me, AITA?",1.0,1.0447273254394531,1,1

 I could come up earlier in the day and leave change of clothes and stuff  and just get the bus back home early next morning then come back up that night again and he said there would be a 0 chance that even if I was going I‚Äôd be staying in his accommodation.

Last night my mom got sick and had to go to the hospital, i had asked her what had happened over text but she was very brief and just said she didnt feel well. I went on and slept because i was exhausted from school. this morning i woke up to multiple voice messages from the friend shes staying with, accusing me of abandoning my mom and making her walk back home from the hospital knowing shes sick, and that my boyfriend should do everything in his power to help out. I understand where they are coming from but how would i be abandoning if im only 16 and have no way to get around? not only that but her husband still lives with her, it would be a completely different thing if she was alone. On top of that her friend was also trying to make me feel bad about me moving to my boyfriends house whos house is already packed as it is and not bringing my mom and my stepdad with me, but i personally dont think thats my responsibility, they are full grown adults and should be able to provide for themselves.. 

i feel like i should mention i have a pretty detached relationship with my mother, it‚Äôs difficult for me to show affection towards her since she wasnt around much when i was a child. she also likes to play the victim quite a lot which is something i dislike about her, she always takes criticism up the ass and constantly guilt trips me when i dont wanna do something shes asking me to do. we dont have that close of a relationship and nowadays it seems like she only reaches out when she needs things.

86,1f05i9a,AITA for choosing my brother over my stepdad to walk me down the aisle?,"I'm (26f) getting married and asked my brother (27m) if he would walk me down the aisle. He's doing it to represent our dad who died 20 years ago but also because we grew up very close and have remained close as adults and even lived together for a time during our adult years. And now he's doing this for me and it means so much. But my choice has made my stepdad unhappy, my mom too, but my stepdad most of all.

He married our mom when we were 8 and 9 years old. He couldn't have kids of his own and tried so hard to fill the gap with us/me. My brother was totally a jerk to him when we were kids and as a result my stepdad stopped trying with him. My brother found it insulting to dad's memory for our stepdad to try and live out his dream of fatherhood through us. I didn't like it either but I was the more reserved of the two of us and never yelled at my stepdad or lashed out at him. But I never got close to him like he wanted me to either. I didn't want to share my dad's space with him. I did tell him this and he told me if I gave it enough time I'd see that he could naturally slot in. But it never happened. And he has acknowledged it before too. When I was 15 and we were in family therapy and I admitted I hadn't tried to open myself up to having another dad and I always kept him separated from the role of a parent. I don't know if I'd say he accepted it but he did give up on me after that too. But that was also because I told him I'd never turn against my brother even though my brother was a dick to him. I was always respectful of him as an adult in the home. Like if he asked me/told me to do something around the house, I would. I would listen if he said no to going out or whatever. I just wasn't open to him the way he wanted me to be.

And that's where this comes into play. My stepdad is upset that I chose my brother over him to walk me down the aisle. But he's more upset that I chose my brother, someone who was really a jerk to him back when we were kids and has never been sorry about it. My stepdad said of all the people I could have chosen I went with the worst one. The person who shit all over him for daring to try and be a parent and fulfill a lifelong dream with kids who had lost their dad.

He claimed my choice was meant as a dig to him. I said it was an honor to my dad and to the brother I have been close with my whole life. He told me that's not what it looks like. Apparently my mom's parents disagreed strongly with him and mom on that. But he told me that anyone who wasn't close to my dad will see it for what it really is and I should be considering that before insulting him in this way.

87,1f05hq8,AITA for arranging to see my young niece with my ex-SIL after my brother messed up the dates?,"Throwaway since my main is basically my name.

My brother (m44) is going through a long divorce (2.5 years since separation) with my soon to be ex-SIL (f40) and they have my niece together (f6) while she has a newborn son with a new boyfriend. I don't know of any cheating on her side, but I do know of cheating on my brother's side so I'm not super sympathetic with him. He also has a lifelong lying problem that gets on my nerves and I need to ignore it at this point just to get along with him without having him freak out. I've been extremely low contact with ex-SIL since split. 

In the past month, I've been pissed off at my brother for breaking multiple plans between my son (m6) and my niece for unknown reasons. It's heartbreaking having my son stand at his door for half an hour waiting to see my niece while he spouts weird lies and delays over the Ring doorbell. We are neighbors and the plans are always small, like bike rides or just simple hang outs. My father keeps telling me my brother is going through a rough breakup with a recent girlfriend so I need to be sympathetic and let it go. However, I'm pissed at his treatment of my son in this way. 

My son had invited my niece to his taekwondo belt test this week with a week's notice, and my brother confirmed the plans multiple times. The night before, I brought it up again because I was skeptical, and he acted surprised and said ""oops! I got the custody days wrong. She's with my ex."" I asked if there was any possibility and he said no. He has had many obvious lies and exaggerations about how terrible his ex is for changing plans for custody, so I didn't push it. 

When I told my son, he was devastated. I didn't blink twice before texting my ex-SIL a few hours before the event and asking if she could bring my niece to the taekwondo test. She was very friendly and accommodating, and although she couldn't make it with her newborn, she suggested I pickup my niece from daycare and go to the event, then bring her home after a little celebration dinner. 

Here's where I may be the asshole. I didn't bother telling my brother any of this for several reasons. My son was mad at him and didn't want him there anyways, it was my ex-SIL's day for my niece so it wasn't really his business, and I was afraid he'd sabotage it somehow like he has sabotage previous get togethers this past month. 

My brother found out the next day from my niece after picking her up from daycare, and went nuclear on me. Angry for contacting his ex. Angry for doing something with his niece without his permission (even though it was the original plan), angry for not giving him a chance to come to the event (even though he showed zero interest after telling me he didn't have his daughter), etc. It devolved into him saying he'd get a no contact order against me and report me to police. 

My father is absolutely on my case and siding with my brother 100% for betraying him.

89,1f04la4,AITA for moving back in with my parents when my sister wasn't allowed?,"I'm 24F and my sister is 26F.

At 18, I moved abroad for 6 years‚Äî3 years studying and 3 working. I've always struggled with depression and found ordinary life events more challenging than my peers. I've worked hard to manage stress, but recently, I realised I needed more support and decided to move back to my home country.

My parents took me in as I had built my adult life elsewhere and had nowhere else to go. Renting in my home city is tough, and it can take months to secure a place. While I‚Äôve been looking for a rental, my parents suggested I stay at home for a year or two to save up for a deposit on my own place, which many of my childhood friends have done. It's easier to buy than rent here.

We agreed on some conditions: I need to get a job, contribute to bills (though they won't charge me rent), help out around the house, and if I'm out later than 11 pm, I should stay at a friend‚Äôs to avoid waking them.

My sister had a different path. She studied locally and stayed home, but got into partying. She often came home noisily in the early hours, which clashed with my quiet, introverted parents who value a clean house. As she got older, tensions grew. She got messier, and louder, especially when drinking.

The final straw was when she started using recreational drugs, and my dad found some in her room. This led my parents to ask her to move out as the drugs went against their values. Other issues like taking money, lying about grades, and repeating a term added to it. They helped her find a new place, but she was evicted within the first year and then was asked to leave a friend‚Äôs house. She now lives in government housing, which she doesn't like, but she's been stable there for a few years.

When she learned I‚Äôd be moving back in, she was upset and commented on how she‚Äôd love a year or two rent-free to save for a deposit. She‚Äôs asked my parents before, but they‚Äôve always said no because her lifestyle hasn‚Äôt changed much. Plus, she‚Äôs in a lot of debt, so she isn‚Äôt in a position to save, as most of her extra cash goes to paying off debt.

Last night, while getting food, she told me she thinks I should move out because it‚Äôs unfair that I get an advantage. She said it‚Äôs favouritism and that her opinion of me would lessen if I stayed with our parents. I understand her feelings; I‚Äôd be hurt if the roles were reversed.

However, I also see my parents' side. She was difficult to live with, came home late, was often drunk or high, brought drugs into the house, which could have jeopardised my mother's job, and isn‚Äôt very responsible with money or property. Despite this, my parents have always supported her, helping with rent, packing, and moving each time she was evicted.

She often came home noisily in the early hours, which clashed with my quiet, introverted parents who value a clean house. As she got older, tensions grew. She got messier, and louder, especially when drinking.

The final straw was when she started using recreational drugs, and my dad found some in her room. This led my parents to ask her to move out as the drugs went against their values. Other issues like taking money, lying about grades, and repeating a term added to it. They helped her find a new place, but she was evicted within the first year and then was asked to leave a friend‚Äôs house. She now lives in government housing, which she doesn't like, but she's been stable there for a few years.

When she learned I‚Äôd be moving back in, she was upset and commented on how she‚Äôd love a year or two rent-free to save for a deposit. She‚Äôs asked my parents before, but they‚Äôve always said no because her lifestyle hasn‚Äôt changed much. Plus, she‚Äôs in a lot of debt, so she isn‚Äôt in a position to save, as most of her extra cash goes to paying off debt.

Last night, while getting food, she told me she thinks I should move out because it‚Äôs unfair that I get an advantage. She said it‚Äôs favouritism and that her opinion of me would lessen if I stayed with our parents. I understand her feelings; I‚Äôd be hurt if the roles were reversed.

However, I also see my parents' side. She was difficult to live with, came home late, was often drunk or high, brought drugs into the house, which could have jeopardised my mother's job, and isn‚Äôt very responsible with money or property. Despite this, my parents have always supported her, helping with rent, packing, and moving each time she was evicted. We all spend time together, and they show her love often, so I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs favouritism.",0.0,0.07645769417285919,0,1
90,1f04dg8,AITA for bringing up old grievances with my mom and not reacting well to her answer,"Throwaway, because I don‚Äôt really want this to be connected to my main account. 

Last week, while I (F30) was decluttering I came across some of my clothes that I used to wear about 3 to 5 years ago. I gained a bit of happy weight since then and don‚Äôt really mind it because I am healthy and physically active, but I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a pang of sadness for my younger self because since middle school and maybe even earlier I‚Äôve never really thought of myself as skinny. The clothes I found were mostly S and M in European sizes (i believe it‚Äôs about 4-6 US) and as you can imagine I was even smaller back in school but my mom was always commenting on my appearance, telling me how my arms were too bulky and soft and how I should always pull in my stomach, stuff like that. I know how it‚Äôs gonna sound but she wasn‚Äôt mean or cruel about that, and I believe she was only meaning well. I mean, Y2K beauty standards, am I right? 

After this little walk down the memory lane I wanted to get some closure and discuss with her how this unhealthy obsession with weight damaged me and probably her, too, but it didn‚Äôt really go well. At first she just denied everything and told me she never called me fat to my face because she felt sorry for me. Then she confronted me that I only seem to remember bad things from my past, then she stated that commenting on daughter‚Äôs appearance is absolutely normal and her mother did it as well, and then she tried to nitpick semantics telling me how she never used the word ‚Äúfat‚Äù so it didn‚Äôt happen. 
At that point I was in tears, trying to just make her stop because I didn‚Äôt really want any of that reaction, but she just continued pushing, telling me how I really was insecure about my weight back in school but she showed me nothing but support. And that‚Äôs where I might be an asshole because I was so strung up I just laughed through tears and ask her what she meant by that. Our relationship back when I was in school and then university was strained at best, I was never a ‚Äútroubled youth‚Äù but she treated me as such for her own reasons so I think the word ‚Äúsupport‚Äù just hit a bit too close to home because that‚Äôs what I never really got from her when I was younger. 

Anyways, my mom hasn‚Äôt been talking to me since last Thursday. I tried to talk to her first several times, not about this whole disaster but some mundane stuff, but she‚Äôs very short with me and only answers if absolutely necessary.

She says she might need extra reassurance but she‚Äôs willing to give it a shot. They go out that one night. The next day or two he texts that he really needs to focus on the baby and being there for the baby mamma and be patient with him. She says wow this is a 180 from Friday so I‚Äôll wait till I hear from you again. He reaches out two weeks later to say the baby mamma is in the hospital and the baby may come early and even though they aren‚Äôt together he really needs to be there for her. My friend was like wow I feel so led on etc and basically the guy just says yeah it‚Äôs a tough situation but I‚Äôll get through it.

I (16F) am currently in my sophomore year of high school and currently have a few family friends of the same age that I occassionally meet throughout the year for social gatherings. My parents first met my family friends' parents at church, but they never really spoke with each other until we all started attending the same primary school, to which they began talking to each other even more due to bonding over things such as our backgrounds (context: I'm half Chinese half Korean but my family friends are all korean) and our kids etc.

At the most recent family gathering yesterday, the talk of senior year, college and future occupations came up as the night had progressed and my friends' parents began asking us where we wanted to go to for college. My family friends had undergone a lot of rigorous tutoring, discipline and were forced into the traditional Asian ""success"" mindset by their parents since they were young, which happened to me as well, but for them it was a lot more extreme. Hence, it wasn't surprising when they said they all wanted to go to colleges like HYPSM, Caltech etc. However, my dream schools were UCB, UCLA and USC, which I told my mom and dad about since freshman year. 

When one of my friends' parents asked me where I wanted to go to, before I could offer a response, my dad immediately said ""She's always wanted to go to Princeton since she was in elementary school. She even told me getting into Yale and Harvard is easy"". After my dad said that, I was angry and confused, but my family friends' parents looked impressed and they were all saying compliments like ""Wow your daughter's so ambitious!"" and ""She must be studying so hard!"" etc. I wanted to say something, but I knew it was too late to undo what my dad had said and I would not only look silly infront of my friends and their parents, but it would also put my dad in a bad spotlight, as it would seem like he was bragging about me.

After the gathering had ended and I got in the car, I lost it. I was pissed because not only did he interrupt me, but I never asked him to speak on my behalf and he lied about me to my friends and their parents as if my university choices were something to be ashamed of. I also reminded him about the possibility of being rejected from Princeton and that it would be even harder to face my friends and their parents due to enormous academic pressure. My dad yelled back at me, saying that I was being rude and ungrateful, because my standards were ""too low"" and that I was ""paranoid"" for thinking about rejection. He then told me I should be thanking him because he did ""a kind gesture and enhanced my reputation"", before telling me I was stupid for not understanding how competitive the world was.

 I thought what my dad did wasn't right, but I know how much my dad loves and cares about me, so I'm seriously wondering if I misinterpreted my dad's actions and overreacted a seemingly ""Kind gesture"".

95,1f03cx6,AITA for not engaging with a friend who was late with no heads up.,"So, a relatively minor event, but need a debate settled.

A few months ago I text a friend asking if he wanted to jump online for a few games at 17:00? He said sure he should be back from the gym by then.

At 17:08 I get a text saying sorry but he's sidetracked with wedding planning and would give me a shout when he's available. I replied that I had gotten our friend on to be our 3rd and so I really needed an idea if he was going to come or not so we could do our own thing, or jump off, or get another friend on to be the 3rd.

He said he would be on by 18:00 latest then.

So the other friend and I hung around until 18:00. Then it became 18:15, then 18:30 and no sign of first friend. So I contact a 4th friend, they jump on the game and we start playing ranked.

At 19:38 the original friend texts me to let him into the voice channel so he can watch what we're up to and hang out. I reply ""nah"". And that's the end of the scenario.

So I was talking with that first late friend yesterday.

He brought up this event from a month ago. He says he was annoyed about my not letting him into the call with us. I can't remember why it was so look back at the chat history and can see the story above unfolding. I tell him that was why.

He says that makes me precious and that people have things come up. I say that that in itself is totally fine but I think him not spending 10 seconds to shoot a text to say he's late or not coming (for the 2nd time that day) makes him rude and I don't feel it's precious to be annoyed by it.

So which is it? Am I the asshole for being annoyed at the situation or is my friend the asshole for not shooting an update that he won't be getting on?

And yes I appreciate this is 2 grown men bickering about squeezing in a couple hours on a hobby. But hopefully everyone realises it's not that deep. We're still friends, just had a debate yesterday about the situation and who was in the ""wrong"".",Everyone Sucks,2024-08-24,"AITA for not engaging with a friend who was late with no heads up. So, a relatively minor event, but need a debate settled.

A few months ago I text a friend asking if he wanted to jump online for a few games at 17:00? He said sure he should be back from the gym by then.

At 17:08 I get a text saying sorry but he's sidetracked with wedding planning and would give me a shout when he's available. I replied that I had gotten our friend on to be our 3rd and so I really needed an idea if he was going to come or not so we could do our own thing, or jump off, or get another friend on to be the 3rd.

He said he would be on by 18:00 latest then.

So the other friend and I hung around until 18:00. Then it became 18:15, then 18:30 and no sign of first friend. So I contact a 4th friend, they jump on the game and we start playing ranked.

For context, 2 of us usually pool in and order a gift for the third person for their birthday for the last couple years. For my last birthday, they got me markers and a sketchbook, which I know were definitely John‚Äôs idea, because we both really like art.

102,1f02b11,AITA for telling my sister I wouldn't babysit all the kids in her blended family either?,"My sister asked our parents if they would babysit be able to babysit for her tonight. They have babysat for my sister and BIL in the past and they had told my sister and BIL before that they were no longer comfortable doing so. My sister asked anyway and my parents said no. My sister asked them why and they expressed their reasons from before had not changed. Their reasons being the family never truly blended, it's difficult to have all the kids together and especially my sister's stepkids who don't consider us family, and are less willing to be respectful. My sister asked me if I could believe it once she finished talking to them (this was Monday) and I said I sure could believe it because I wouldn't babysit them all again either. She told me the kids came back so calm with me though and I said I basically let them ignore each other which is why and I was focused on her two youngest (4m, 2f). She told me we're all so dramatic and she can't believe I'm on our parents side.

My sister's blended family is made up of her (40f), her husband (44m), her stepkids (13f, 12m), her bio kids (12m, 10f) and the two ours babies (4m, 2f). My sister and her husband met six months to a year after they lost their first spouses and the mother/father of the four oldest children. They both attended the same support group and they attended the same support group family days. They used those family days as time for everyone to get to know each other without saying they were dating. Honestly even though they pushed the kids to be friends, they gravitated naturally to other kids and not their future stepsiblings. Same with not gravitating naturally to their future stepparent. Then when they announced they were getting married the kids were not positive about it. Which is why they were in family therapy during the engagement and for a few months after the wedding. I saw no change in them. But I'm not there every day so maybe there was. When my sister had her 4 year old it was clear the kids weren't accepting of the situation. If someone asked how they liked their new sibling, they said they didn't have any new siblings. My 10 year old niece would cry if people called BIL her dad.

And nothing has changed. The kids don't like spending time together, they separate every chance they get, the ignore the two younger ones completely and I know they do this even when asked to keep an eye on them. They don't want to sit next to a step or half sibling at meal times. If you ask one to tell the other kids dinner's ready or something, they tell their bio sibling and that's it. My sister's stepchildren will tell us not to talk to them frequently. I took all six kids to McDonald's one day and the two stepkids went to another table and wouldn't sit with us. My sister's older bio kids spoke to me but were clearly intentionally not looking at the younger two.

But I was still a little annoyed so I jokingly said, ""when i get asked out but i‚Äôm his ride..üíî"" and he then responded with ""but i'm paying..."" it just kind of rubbed me off the wrong way because it seemed like I OWED him something because he's paying, but in reality I thought he was just treating me out to a good meal since it was my birthday.

We live in India where the culture is quite modest and moral values are considered important.

I didn't mind her dress choices that much until recently. While they stood out and were more flashy, she still didn't show too much skin.

However lately she has been dressing in more risque things, showing more skin, wearing shorter skirts etc which makes her stand out. She even goes to work like that.

I have never been one to put restrictions but people have started to talk and it has affected her reputation. This can cause a lot of issues for her.

She also gets harassed a lot on the street but when I bring that up she says she doesn't care and sometimes she talks back to them. She doesn't realise what safety issue this is especially when she is out alone. She claims that it isn't related to what she wears but I have definitely noticed that it happens only when she dresses different from everyone else.

I asked her to respect the modesty of society and to stop dressing like that and reminded her that she lives under my roof and with the things people are saying she will never manage to leave if she destroys her reputation.

20 gets along with my daughter fine and they pretty much like each other, although they aren't that close yet. The problem here is my daughter, who is considered babyish for her age, idolizes 16, who acts more maturely. My daughter has been paying attention to what she likes and doesn't like, and is trying to imitate everything. She even picked up video games, which she previously hated. It's not like she has lost her identity though--- she's still pretty girly, but 16 is not.

15 always tries to talk to 16 but 16 is never interested to talk to her. She gives her the shortest reply possible then walks away or make excuses. 15 would give anything for her attention, and she always gives 16 little treats bought with her pocket money, and 16 accepts them everytime with a ""thanks"" then gets away from her.

16 approached me today and told me I should punish 15 for copying her, but I don't agree with her as I don't see any malice in 15's actions, and I also think 16 can be more friendly towards her.

For the last three or four years I have been thinking that after school ends I don‚Äôt want to be in any contact with M. She has been really annoying.

I haven‚Äôt talked about these things with S because they have been friends longer. And I have always thought that she don‚Äôt see the same things that I. 

But two weeks ago me and M went to this party and didn‚Äôt say anything about it to S. She doesn‚Äôt like drinking. And we thought that she already knew that we were going.

But then we went eating with S and she told me that she is not mad at me and more mad at M. She also told me that she has felt the same way as I have about M for some time now. She told me that she has seen how fed up I was to the shit that M pulled.

So I had my first experience of having a beautiful baby and becoming a mother five months ago. I‚Äôm exhausted but loving every moment, when I was pregnant my mum would ask me how I‚Äôm doing etc and I‚Äôd tell her my progress and any changes. Here‚Äôs the part I don‚Äôt understand and I‚Äôm very upset about, when I was heavily pregnant around 8 month mark my mum decided to go abroad on holiday. I was abit taken back and my husband was surprised along with my in laws, they couldn‚Äôt believe it but I didn‚Äôt think anything of it and thought maybe my mum planned the holiday ages ago and it just so happened I was heavily pregnant and she would come back as soon as possible. Anyways so I gave birth at 41 weeks and my mum never came back from the ‚Äúholiday‚Äù and I had utmost support from my mother in law. I went through a lot of pain and emotions in my birth stages and was terrified. I was also naive giving my mum the benefit of the doubt wondering maybe there‚Äôs something important going on and that‚Äôs why she wasn‚Äôt there for me. Anyways so me being a good daughter I video called my mum after I gave birth and my mum was a little emotional. I found it so awkward that i video called but I didn‚Äôt think much of it. A few weeks go by and one phone call me and my mum had she said to me about my birth and pregnancy that ‚Äúeveryone‚Äôs gone through this so you be a strong girl this is nothing‚Äù . 
I thought wtf how can you say that when I gave birth to the first grandchild In the family and it‚Äôs my first experience and it was so difficult.
The reason why my mum went abroad she said ‚Äúshe needed to go check the house she was building back in our country‚Äù. 
Sooo she went abroad to go fix a house while I‚Äôm in a vulnerable condition and need parental support. 
My mum never came back from the vacation five months after I gave birth. Can you imagine ??? I was so upset and angryby this and still am because there‚Äôs no care whatsoever towards my feelings. So basically until now I refuse to go visit my mum to take my baby and see my mum because I‚Äôm so deeply hurt, I‚Äôve always been the ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine, no worries‚Äù type of daughter but then I actually had a good think and realised that my birth was basically unimportant to my mum. 
She also thinks I‚Äôm over exaggerating and my behaviour is wrong and disrespectful. But it‚Äôs not that , she chose to go abroad when I was heavily pregnant and was never there for me during my birth and came back five months after my birth. Crazy to me!!

Am I in the wrong that I don‚Äôt want to go visit my mum and allow her to see my five month old daughter yet ?? I just can‚Äôt seem to do it yet because I‚Äôm so taken back by the insensitivity towards me.

The baby's father and father's family don't care about the baby so it's all on my stepsister. Her dad said she could live here for as long as she wants/needs and she'll have help. Thing about that is, she doesn't want my mom's help or mine. My mom is blind to this. Her husband wants to ignore the part where she doesn't want help from me and mom and they expect us to chip in and pull together as a ""family"" to help.

My mom and stepdad have been married for 10 years. They met at a widowed parents group two months after my dad died and three months after my stepdad's wife died. They were dating before the end of the year and married within five months. It went about as bad as you probably expect. We didn't blend. My stepsister wanted nothing to do with me or mom and she struggled with being jealous any time her dad even spoke to me. Being a little younger when everything went down, people expected me to see my stepdad as my new dad pretty quickly and a lot were shocked it didn't happen. He never tried to be. But I think he also expected it to just happen because of my age. So there's a weird relationship where I call him my stepdad but I don't ever really say my parents for him and mom, I'll just say my mom. I'll also never call my stepsister my sibling. There's a way better chance my stepdad will be talked about as one of my parents before I'd ever call her a sibling/family.

I don't want to treat people like shit because of it either. Although my mom is so naive when it comes to my stepsister and how she feels that maybe I'd lose it too.

This shit all started when my stepsister went into labor. She was at home with mom and instead of telling mom she went into labor, she called up her friend and had the friend drive her to the hospital and called her dad screaming. He went to her and called my mom like where are you she's having the baby and my mom rushes over there. My stepsister didn't let my mom into the room at all and didn't let my stepdad introduce the baby to her. But of course she was going to lean on mom sooo much after giving birth \*not\*.

Anyways, we reconnected a week or so ago and noticed she was probing to see how I felt about her. While I never had a thing for her back then I did find her attractive so I figured why not. She seemed very keen and we arranged for her to come over to mine when her daughter goes to her father's for the weekend.

All seemed to be going well until I asked her what she likes to eat so I can cook. She said I didn't have to and conversation seemed to die down that day. And for the next few days. I sent her my address but had a gut feeling she no longer wanted to come over even though she said nothing. 

Now I've learnt to trust my gut. So I made other plans and was out of the house. And right on the time she was supposed to come over she texts me and said there was a change of plans and she has her daughter this weekend. 

Told her it's all good and these things happens and left it as that. But then she asked what I'm going to do instead and I said I'm out with friends. She got mad for standing her up. I asked her to explain and she said that if she were going to come over I wouldn't have been there. While true, she cancelled which I had a good feeling about.

115,1f0052y,AITAH for not thanking someone within a week of receiving a very large gift,"So i had a family member gift me 2k out of no where. They asked when they could stop by to drop off a check so i told them my work hours (i work nights). They showed up same day without calling and only texted so i happened to be asleep and my wife acceped the check and told them i would call them back when free. 

Now here's where i may be an ah, i worked mandatory 12s for 13 days in a row and so i planned to call on my day off or maybe even drop off a thank you card to have more time to thank them properly which is today 8 days after receiving the check, which i personally think no matter the circumstances even if i didnt have work waiting up to 2 weekends is alright due to people having lives and jobs no matter the gift size.  

Well i got a message yesterday (on the 7th day) saying how they are dissappinted in me and arent sure if i was just unappreciative, didnt really need the money, if i didnt care to take time outside of myself, or if i wasnt raised correctly. But added how they support and love me to the end of that message and maybe i just needed to hear all of that even if it was hard to hear. (There was more colorful language but keeping it vague for anonymity but this is the bulk of it)

While i agree that maybe i should have called sooner versus waiting till i had time to properly thank them fully, i think that the message was incredibly rude and they could have waited at least one more day, my first day off in almost 2 weeks before sending that. It makes me almost want to still give them a thank you card with a check back for that same amount and wash my hands of this and avoid them in and out of family functions and refuse any future cash.

Some relevant info.

They are aware i worked 13 days in a row and today was my first free day, but even if unaware i still think their reaction is uncalled for. 
Said family member is retired, unsure if thats relevent or not so thought i should add it just in case. 
I never asked for the money, i never hinted at needing money, have a good paying job, im looking at buying a house in a year or two but havent really brought that up to this specific family member it was really out of nowhere but not unusal for them to randomly hand out large amounts of cash once a year


Atiah in this situation? And does anyone have any advice on how to reply to their message because all i feel right now is anger even if i get where they are coming from that was just too much and all they had to do was wait one more day and they would have gotten their proper thank you vs a 10 minute one that i felt would be too rushed for something that big.


Edit thank you so much everyone, i realize i am an ah this time. I left out a big part because i wanted to know if i was in fact an asshole this instance or not because they are known to do this, but at least reassures me i was not an ah previously because quite a few suggestions are what i have gotten blown up for in the past. 
This family member when handing out cash always looks for ways for people to be rude or not thankful enough so they can take out their anger from their kids having a screaming match with them every time they try to help them out saying they arent charity cases etc. I just seem to be the punching bag more often because i go to less family functions and have less free time due to work. One time it was that i wasnt there physically to accept the check when i was out of town, another because i didnt do a proper thank you with a card and just called, one time i texted telling them i would drop off a card in a week and they told me texts dont count because they dont text and to just drop off the card even if it takes a bit or call with a proper thank you next time, another family member got blown up after giving a quick call before work because it doesnt count if its rushed even if you get back to them later. The list goes on and it starts even bigger fights if you turn down the check, but at this point with it being big fights almost everytime now i just felt like going nuclear since everyone tiptoes around them everytime because we have to make sure to do a proper thank you in their eyes every time.  
But i will eat my words and give them a proper thank you and a card since i was in the wrong this time, but will probably cancel having dinner with them in 2 weeks since i am upset with them saying i don't have time for anything except outside myself and take the day to go on a nice relaxing date with my wife even if it means ""proving them right"" because as they always say actions have consequences and i havent used my vacation time to just relax and not just to visit family in a long time.",Asshole,2024-08-24,"AITAH for not thanking someone within a week of receiving a very large gift So i had a family member gift me 2k out of no where.

116,1f002fa,AITA for not letting my mom see my kids because of fat-shaming?,"I (31f) was on the chubby side growing up and my mom (58f) was always hard on me for my weight. It deeply impacted my self-esteem, to the point that I ended up losing an unhealthy amount of weight in my teens just to please her. Once I left the house, I gained some weight back and, after years of therapy, I finally felt like I had a healthy relationship to food and exercise. My mom also seemed to stop being as obsessed with my body once I wasn't around her 24/7, and our relationship got a lot better.

I had a daughter nine years ago, let's call her Mia. Mia is a sweet girl and ADORES her grandma. A couple days ago I sent her and her brother (Liam, 7m) to stay with my parents for the weekend. On the car ride home, I noticed that Mia wasn't her bubbly self and asked her if something was wrong. She was clearly embarrassed but eventually she started to bawl and told me what happened. Apparently, that afternoon they had gone out for ice cream. Mia tried to order a cone with 2 scoops, but my mother stopped her and changed her order to a single scoop in a cup. When Liam ordered a cone with 2 scoops, my mother didn't say a word. When Mia asked why Liam got a cone and not her, my mother told her it was because she's fat and needs to lose weight or nobody will find her attractive. I was livid.

The second we got home, I called my mom and told her that what she said was completely unacceptable and that from then on, I would have to chaperone any time she spent with my daughter. My mom told me I was overreacting, that Mia was exaggerating, and that I shouldn't believe a nine year old over her. She told me it's probably just something she picked up in dance class and that I was ""projecting."" I was pretty sure she was full of crap but I wanted to verify anyway, so I had another talk with Mia. I told her that if my mother ever says anything like that to her again, to tell me right away. She started crying again, and told me that not only was this not the first time something like this happened, but also that my mother told Mia not to tell me because I'm fat and she wouldn't want to be like me.

I called my mom again, and told her everything Mia told me. All she said was, ""Well was I wrong? You are fat.""

I hung up. She tried to call me again but I didn't pick up. I haven't responded to her since. This morning she got my brother involved. He thinks it is an overreaction to not respond and that she didn't mean any harm, but I am pretty adamant about not wanting to expose my daughter to her bullshit. I told my brother that if my mother is willing to apologize to Mia and I, and agree to chaperoned visits, I might consider letting them see each other. I know she won't do that. I feel horrible because it's Liam's birthday next week and I know he wants his grandma there but I just don't feel comfortable with my kids being around her, not yet. AITA?

that I was purposefully exposing him for his past mistake.

manipulative to our friends. He said that I needed to delete the song or he would sue me.

To be clear, I did talk about the relationship in that song but I was never explicit about it. I never mentioned him by name. In that song he is referred to as ‚Äúyou‚Äù which could be anyone. Unless you are in our close circle you would never know who I was talking about.

However, some people said that my approach to the situation was a little too harsh and I shouldn‚Äôt have yelled at them and should have instead been nicer like‚Ä¶ telling them it was okay and that everyone makes mistakes. I shouldn‚Äôt have yelled because they were trying their best, but again, they told me they were experienced.

119,1ezzr4y,AITA? I (30F) turned off my location for my mom (60F). She's upset I did it without talking to her about first. ,"I get it. She's worried, I live alone in the city across the country from her. But her anxiety has gotten to be too much even with the work she is doing for herself.

I went out tonight and because of the location got a text asking if I was okay. I responded right away but she always thinks someone else must have my phone because she doesn't understand why im at said location. When I was small we had a family password to share for emergencies.  She's only asked for it once before and the 1st time was last month for a similar situation. She asked again for it tonight and it ripped me from having fun in the space for the 1st hour.

Im an adult, I respond right away since I too have anxiety and understand. However, Ive been working on a lot of different things and boundaries is one of them. So when I got home tonight I took her off the sharing list.

She asked if I was home and said she couldn't see location. I said yeah, I took you off, but Im home.

She fly. ""You're punishing me."" ""You're trying to be all in control"" ""pysco""

I see the words. I called her out on it. ""You're being mean. I'm not punishing you I took away a privilege I allowed bc it was not serving you. You had my location but it didn't matter, you still needed me to triple confirm okayness.""

I need reassurance. AITA? Should I have waited a day and told her I was doing it instead of ripping the band aid off?

  
Edit: Thanks for the responds. Some of them were unhelpful in the fact that all you did repeat what I said. ""Set a boundary."" Yeah, I did. See above. 

I know Im not the asshole for not sharing any longer. I was wondering if I was one for stopping before having a conversation about it. Communication goes a long way in relationships. 

We reached out this morning and she apologized for the nasty comments, and understood my PoV.

120,1ezzqj0,AITA for not telling my friend our mutual friend spread lies about him mistreating his ex?,"Hoping to keep this short and sweet.

A number of years ago my friend, Amy, told me a mutual friend of ours, Brad, had mistreated his ex, Kate, possibly to the point of abuse. I always took this confession at face value, even though I did come to learn Amy was a pathological liar, who misrepresented or straight up lied frequently throughout our friendship. 

I stopped being friends with Amy about 6 years ago. Me and Kate have kept in touch and we recently ended up at a bar at the same event. I told her, privately before drinks, that I was sorry that Brad had treated her poorly while they were together. She was shocked and confirmed to me that nothing Amy told me had happened, and that Kate had ended her relationship with Amy over also discovering lies.

I am still in contact with Brad and as far as I'm awaare he doesnt know Amy has said these things behind his back.

I know Amy and Brad are still very close friends, she was recently a bridesmaid in his wedding. 

My concern here is really two fold: 

Potential situation where Amy made up this lie to impress me in some way and it was the only time she said it. I haven't kept close friends with Brad because of what Amy told me, and I'm worried if I reach out out of the blue it will just be seen as me stirring up drama that didn't need to exist.

Potential situation two is what Amy said was true and Kate denied it to me because she didn't feel comfortable or ready to discuss. If I bring it up to Brad in this case it might somehow trigger backlash against Kate she doesn't deserve.

I‚Äôll explain myself better 

I 21 (F) decided to invite my entire family to dinner to celebrate that I have passed my driving exam with a perfect score. 
I was so excited that even when I don‚Äôt have a lot of money I decided to invite my mom and brother to spoil them a little bit with tacos in a restaurant. 
The problem in the country I live is that everything is overpriced (I did have that in count when I invited my family and I was ready to spend 80 dollars to pay for dinner) 

I reserved a table at 19:00 and at 19:02 when I was in the door waiting to get in they called me and asked me where was I (which I found it kinda funny but more awkward since I was already there waiting to get in) 
After we got the table they told us we had one hour and a half for the table and than later we will have to go. Sounds reasonable to me so we started ordering a really nice waiter took our order and the food arrived fast but it was cold af. 
I guess they already had the batches of food ready cause I asked for no jalapeno and they brought me tacos with it and just told me to get it out of the taco if I didn‚Äôt like it. 
At this point I don‚Äôt really care cause I‚Äôm used to it.
The service in my country is shit and you can‚Äôt expect much of any place you go out to eat (I‚Äôm being dead serious about this).

After we finished eating I asked for the receipt and it arrived my time to pay. The entire dinner turned out to be something like 76 dollars but since I had a tight budget I decided to pay 80 dollars for everything (less than 10% tip) 
The person who came to charge me was another waitress not the waiter who actually served us and when I told her I would pay 80 with an extremely bad attitude told me ‚ÄúDo you know you are not paying 10% tip?‚Äù ‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt have to but you know‚Ä¶‚Äù said that while starring me from toe to head

I‚Äôm sorry but I found her attitude and her question extremely rude. Even if a client decides to give 1 dollar tip it should be accepted with gratitude and not be questioned by anyone. I felt extremely uncomfortable and at the end ended up paying the tip she asked me to pay. 

I know some people who work in the restaurant business and are waiters will be mad at me and tell me that I am the asshole for not paying enough tip but Isn‚Äôt just something you choose to pay?

1. In my house, shouting, yelling, cursing, mocking happen everyday from morning until night because my mom has to deal with my young brother - who has autism. She is pretty crumpy and unhappy with everything, she often yells, nitpicks or mocks me (my appeareance, my habits, my alone moment,...) for no reason at all. It is hard to feel like ""home"" in a house like that.

It has always been a big problem between us. 

2. I do not have my personal space, I do not have a bedroom, a real study corner, or bed. WE ARE NOT POOR, my family owns three different houses. It is just my mom's decision to move to a really small place where I have to sleep on the ground next to her bed. I must stay in a same space with mom or else she will be yelling a lot. I am not allowed to do things I want (laughing, calling with friends, working,... ) because those will irritate mom. 

3. My dad does not care about the situation at all. He does not live with me and mom and only wants me to behave better. 

4. Mom and Dad have given me a lot of both physical and emotional trauma since I was a little kid. 

5. Like I said, my brother has autism, he is doing better everyday. However, mom and dad always say that I have to study and work the best that I can, earn good miney in order to ""look after, take care of, provide"" my brother. Honestly, I do not see my future so clear if it is tightened with an autistic person. I do not say I hate him, but I am not really sure if ""providing and looking after him"" is my responsibility, I did not decide to give birth to him.
Since he was born (I was in 9th grade), I had to take care of him a lot, entertain him, stay home 24/7 to look after him, endure mom's tantrums because of him, cannot do anything in the evening (after 9P.M) because that will wake him, endure his tantrums towards me. I did not have any fun with friends or fun for myself. 

6. I want a new chapter of MY OWN LIFE. I do not want to stay with people I cannot adore, and does not adore me in a healthy way.

It is not that mom never does good things for me. She places food on the table, pay my tuition fees, though she is pretty unhappy with me using her money. Once in one or two years she will buy me things. She does care about me, the only issue is her love and care is kinda toxic and unhealthy for me.

If I move out, I will be living with my boyfriend in a three years. If we break up, I will live alone. I am still in university and will work to earn the money for food and tuition fees.

129,1ezyaav,AITA for getting on my bfs case about his sleeping schedule?,"For a bit of context my bf spent half of the day at Gamescom then got back home around 10pm. On my side it's already well into the morning (9am - we're in a LDR). I figured at around 3am (his time) he would be asleep by then as I thought he would be exhausted. But I get a message from him saying he'll call me soon to tell me more about his day. Soon after, I suddenly get a call from him on Discord, so I think ""Alright, we can have a short call for a bit."" Unsurprisingly he's still playing Valorant.



From time to time I ask him about when he's going to sleep/if he's going to sleep soon since it's well into 4am for him. When he finally quits Valorant, I see him move on to opening another game. So I get on his case for this, yet he still insists for a while. Clearly exasperated, I just give up and go silent for a while. It's obvious to him that the mood soured. I remind him that he said he wanted to change, and I tell him nothing's going to happen if he keeps this up. I tell him that I appreciate that he wanted to call me even when it was so late, but I also tell him that he would definitely stay up regardless. Idk if this was harsh but I just felt like I didn't want him to lean on calling me as the reason. Imo I've seen it enough times to recognize there are other things going on.



I don't have a great sleeping schedule either but I mostly stay up to hang out with our online friends or to spend time with him. In my mind staying up that late is worth it and a different matter. The thing with my bf is - he stays up regardless. Whether it's Valorant or something else, he's been staying up very late on his own. There have been times when we'd say our good nights and I'll receive a few IG reels from him 20-40 minutes or so after. I know staying up this late for him hasn't really done him any favors. Even he expresses regret for oversleeping and then waking up in the afternoon only to lose half of the day already. I brought all of this up to him during the call. 



He went quiet and seemed to feel down after just letting me go on about his sleep sched. It wasn't so much of an outburst on my end so much as feeling like I ruined the mood by incessantly talking about it. I tried to end it on a better note and still expressed that it was nice to see him and that I appreciated the call and being updated on his entire day. Then we ended the call and messaged each other good night one more time.



Maybe there was a better way I could've gone about this? He would be just as insistent on telling me off to go sleep/rest if I stayed up too late (and rightly so).

130,1ezy8cv,AITA for planning on showing up to my boyfriend‚Äôs college move in day even though his grandmother doesn‚Äôt want me there?,"Hi, I'm Kayla, 19, and my boyfriend Kaleb, 18, is moving into his college dorm today. His grandmother doesn't want me to be there. Here's the context: We've been dating for about a year and a half, and I'm close to his family. I see him weekly, usually on Saturdays, and sometimes more often. A month ago, his grandparents were going through a tough time, leading Kaleb to stay with his aunt for a week. When I asked his grandmother if I could visit, she responded rudely, saying Kaleb would be busy helping them around the house and couldn't have visitors. I wasn't aware of this arrangement, so I told Kaleb, which led to a big argument between him and his grandparents. After the fight, his grandmother texted me again, saying Kaleb wouldn't be living with them anymore and that I could visit him at his aunt's place instead. I didn't respond because I didn't know what to say. 

After a week, Kaleb returned to his grandparents' home, but I noticed his grandmother seemed cold towards me when I visited. This confused me because we had always had a good relationship. Last weekend, I thought things were fine between us when she gave me a long hug and asked how I was doing. However, two days ago, when I asked if I could come over on Friday to spend the night before Kaleb's move, she replied that I had seen him more than they had in the past month and that they would be handling the move without me. I was shocked, and so was Kaleb, as we had always planned for me to be there.

That night, Kaleb talked to his grandmother about the move and other college-related matters. When I asked him about their conversation, he told me that she had said I was annoying and that college move-in was a family event, not for girlfriends. Kaleb defended me, insisting that I would always be around, no matter what she thought. He also said that I could still come, but I would have to drive myself to the college. I initially hesitated because I didn't want to be somewhere I wasn't wanted, but I've decided to go because Kaleb wants me there.

For additional context, Kaleb was in foster care before his grandparents adopted him after his parents passed away. His grandmother has always tried to control his life, and it's been worse in recent weeks. She's not a sweet old lady; she's in her late 50s or early 60s and has a reputation for being two-faced and manipulative. I hadn't seen it before, but now I realize how selfish she is. Kaleb hasn't told his grandmother that I'm coming to the move-in; I'm just going to show up.

131,1ezy0d6,WIBTA if I didn‚Äôt make my BIL a godfather to my baby at my sister‚Äôs request,"I (38F) had a baby girl this past Monday. This was my second child, and my first with my partner (40M) 

Three days post partum, my sister (32F) calls me. She asks me if I‚Äôm having the baby baptised, and if I‚Äôm planning to ask her husband (37M) to be a Godfather.

I was pretty taken aback my this. Mostly because I‚Äôm three days after having a C section and just home from hospital. I told her I wasn‚Äôt sure, I hadn‚Äôt considered asking him. She got very annoyed and slammed the phone down, but not before saying she was disappointed I wouldn‚Äôt consider it, that I obviously didn‚Äôt think he belonged in our family, and that I would be massively hurting his feelings over this. 

Here‚Äôs some factors for consideration in this whole situation

- My sister is my daughter (8F)s Godmother. She was not in relationship with her husband at the time of said baptism. Had she been so, he would have been a Godfather.

- This is my partner‚Äôs first baby. Ultimately I want him to have the final say in Godparents, if we even decided to have her baptised.

- if we were to have her ‚Äúbaptised‚Äù it wouldn‚Äôt be a traditional Christening. We are not religious. It would mostly likely be a civil naming ceremony. The plan would always be for her to have several Godmothers. My partner was brought up by a single mum and raised by a ‚Äúvillage‚Äù of incredible women and he likes the idea that our own ‚Äúvillage‚Äù is honoured in this way. We hadn‚Äôt even considered her having a Godfather.

- I like the guy, but we‚Äôre not hugely close. I‚Äôve never spent time with him without my sister. My partner has tried to engage with him but he is a very shy person. My partner even stood next to him at the altar on his wedding day because his best man went and sat down 10 minutes before the ceremony and my poor BIL looked sick with nerves‚Ä¶ For context (although I don‚Äôt want view this situation as transactional) I wasn‚Äôt in my sisters bridal party‚Ä¶

Here‚Äôs where I might be the asshole

- was I petty? Did I dismiss this outright simply because she had the audacity to ask?

- My sister and her husband are unlikely to ever have children of their own due to health issues. This might be the nearest he gets

- BIL has a terrible relationship with his own family. He sees our family as his support net and he is a welcome part of it. I know he won‚Äôt have even asked about being a Godfather and having this conversation will have been my sisters idea, but I do hate the idea of upsetting him or making him feel alienated.

- My family will want me to ask him now, simply because they‚Äôre all a bit scared of my sister and how she will react to something like this. My mum is very unwell and doesn‚Äôt cope with family drama. I can‚Äôt help but think I should have said yes just to keep the peace.


I hate the idea of upsetting anyone. As you can imagine I‚Äôm a bit hormonal at the moment and very tired and I might be overthinking, however I feel like I may have been a bad person here.

She would also talk shit about us to our other friends. She caused drama often and always made herself out to be the victim. Her actions caused us to stop being friends with her and a few other also ended the friendship.  Tiff cut all contact, me, Clair, and Aurora were not in contact but friendly when she was around. Clair had felt bad she had no friends and had been snapping her to try and help her. Today Aurora invited me Tiff and Clair over for a birthday sleepover and we started ranting about Ana. Clair accidentally butt dialed Ana on snap and went to the bathroom. We were all talking in confidence about why we stayed friends with her for so long when she was not a good friend to us and just general ranting about how she hurt us when Clair came back and saw her phone and realized Ana had been on a call the whole time. Clair hung up on Ana and told us Ana had been on call. We were all stunned and felt really bad that she heard what we said but we also felt like what we were saying was true and we weren‚Äôt sorry we said it but we were sorry she had to hear it, because we were just ranting in confidence.

And Ana had said that Tiff had been lying about why they stopped being friends but we have seen text proof on Tiff‚Äôs phone that Tiff isn‚Äôt lying. Ana was telling at me about how I answered the phone with ‚Äúhey, what‚Äôs up‚Äù, and saying I didn‚Äôt care about her feelings. She yelled at us for a while and hung up eventually.

Ana blew up at Clair even though we told her Clair was in the bathroom and didn‚Äôt even say anything, because she felt Clair had been fake when trying to help Ana previously. Ana also called Aurora fake and said it wasn‚Äôt okay to talk shit about people. Aurora tried to explain that she was ranting in confidence to her friends and didn‚Äôt intend to hurt anyone‚Äôs feelings. She also expressed that it wasn‚Äôt fake and that in the past Ana had done the same about all of us. And Ana had said that Tiff had been lying about why they stopped being friends but we have seen text proof on Tiff‚Äôs phone that Tiff isn‚Äôt lying. Ana was telling at me about how I answered the phone with ‚Äúhey, what‚Äôs up‚Äù, and saying I didn‚Äôt care about her feelings. She yelled at us for a while and hung up eventually. We‚Äôre hoping she takes this as a sign to how she treats others so she can improve future friendships. So are we the assholes for talking shit about our ex friend and how we responded to her confrontation?

I have custody of my younger brother (17) as well. Let me start with the fact that I don't think I'm in the wrong for not letting my mom see my baby generally speaking, but the circumstances are... weird. My mom was a very neglectful parent. Between me and my brothers, we went without food, electricity, school clothes and supplies, you name it.

I didn't want her having anything to do with my daughter. Then she was hospitalized for an overdose, and was dangerously close to not making it. The doctors called me to come say my goodbyes. It's weird, but I still have love and compassion for my mom.

I came to the hospital to tell her goodbye, and there was no hiding the fact that I was pregnant.

Im (24M) the story is about this a situation-ship with a (22F).
We came across each other on social, i messaged her, we started talking and about a week later we met for the first time, eventually after 3-4 times of seeing each other our meet ups became sexual, Ive made it clear from the beginning till now that I‚Äôm not the one to plan a future with, therefore if you don‚Äôt want to be in this situation you are always free to leave, i don‚Äôt lie or sell dreams. She stuck around and didn‚Äôt care about that and was cool with the whole thing.

2 years down the line i hear people bringing her name up in a random convo, these people happened to have went to middle school with her. 
Me, her, and the people in this story live relatively near each other, or at least in the same city you can say. They mentioned her as ‚Äúthe girl that got pregnant at the age of 19 and had to get an abortion‚Äù
This girl has been nothing but nice, sweet and helpful for the whole time I‚Äôve known her for. Nothing bad unless you consider the fact that she never mentioned this and i had to hear about it from other people, luckily I‚Äôm a private person so people Dont know who i know or what i do, so in that conversation i was pretending to be clueless.

Now would i be the asshole if i was to not confront her about it, pretend like i know nothing, since for a while Ive been thinking what would the end of this situation ship look like or how do i even end it at some point?
I feel like i can use this as an excuse later on, but it wouldn‚Äôt be genuine since i knew about it and continued to go along with her.

Even though, I feel like its hard to live with it since i talk to her and see her like at least once a week give or take, but the fact she didn‚Äôt bring it up and i had to learn about it from others is weird, my other psychology student side tells me to, keep it going and try to learn as much as possible from this situation.

(Disclaimer everyone mentioned in this story come from the same background of kinda conservative families, which means being pregnant before marriage is shameful) 
thats why i would understand why she would hide it, but at the same time it seems like everyone knew about it except for me, so i was the only one unaware of her past situation.

She‚Äôs constantly involved in drama, does not study much, has broken up with said boyfriend, gotten with another guy, then back to old boyfriend.

141,1ezwkoh,AITA For trying to pass by a mom and her kids while exiting an airplane ,"So today while getting off a plane from my flight, I had a bad interaction and I cannot stop thinking about it.

I was in the every back row for the flight I was on and had to wait before I could start walking. I waited for everyone to get their stuff and started walking from my row and was making my way down the aisle until I stop to let a family pack their stuff and get through. 

The family was a mom and dad with 3 little kids, and they had a lot of stuff on the seats and overhead bin. When the dad and one of the kids got their stuff and walked down the aisle, I decided to start to make my way after them because I saw the mom and the other two kids had things on their seats and was still packing their stuff. I decided to try to walk pass really because I figured they would need at least a few minutes. I didn‚Äôt realize they were ready because the mom says ‚Äúdo you mind? we would like to go as a family‚Äù. She said it kind of passive aggressively but I completely understood why they would want to stick together, so I say a quick sorry, then stopped (I walked two step past their row). edit: sorry i meant to say two steps into their row, I backed up a bit when she asked me to 

So I stood there waiting for the mom and kids to finish packing and suddenly she  snaps at me and sarcastically says ‚Äúyou know what, go, since you‚Äôre so eager‚Äù. She then scoffed at me as well and I was so stunned, because all I did was stand there waiting. I didn‚Äôt realized I looked so eager to pass by, I was tired and my feet hurt. I had no intention of 
cutting by her and was willing to wait, I admit I made the wrong call when I tried to go after the dad went. There were some people behind me as well and I did not want to hold up the line for too long. 

Her row was the about 2-3 rows before the exit where the flight attendant was standing about a metre away. I could not stop thinking about this interaction because I like to think I am a respectable person. I very rarely have rude interactions and but this time I felt as if it was my fault because I should‚Äôve asked if they were ready or waited more patiently. 

She did say it in a very annoyed way but she is also a mom handling 3 kids on a flight so I understand. I also could have been more communicative and made sure it was okay for me to go, but I made the call on a whim and it was just me and my carry-on, which would‚Äôve taken a few seconds for me to pass and go to the exit. 

I also wish I said something when she snapped me just to clear the air but I figured we were all in a rush so there was no point even thought I felt really bad. It was a late flight and I‚Äôm sure everyone was tired but that interaction really threw me off and I was wondering if I did something wrong and what I can do to prevent such interactions.

As the parent and I were chatting a kind stranger saw the two children and offered them $5 to go buy some ice cream. Both children run to the ice cream truck but B was the one holding the money and bought themself a $4 ice cream and nothing for A. B then stood there and had A watch them eat it while the parent pocketed the remaining $1. I felt very bitter after that situation I‚Äôll admit. The next day instead of ice cream there was shaved ice so I bought A and myself shaved ice and nothing for B. It was the most petties thing I‚Äôve ever done. It was even worse because after I handed A theirs B thought the second one was for them but was immediately disappointed when I told them it was mine.

Okay let me give some context here‚Ä¶. My child (we‚Äôll say A) and their friend ( B) were at the park together. I was with them while B‚Äôs parent was commuting from work. Ice cream truck ends up pulling up and both asked for ice cream and I told both of them ‚Äúno‚Äù. Moments later B‚Äôs parent arrived to get B from the park. B asked their parent if they could get ice cream and the parent gave the same ‚Äúno‚Äù answer. As the parent and I were chatting a kind stranger saw the two children and offered them $5 to go buy some ice cream. Both children run to the ice cream truck but B was the one holding the money and bought themself a $4 ice cream and nothing for A. B then stood there and had A watch them eat it while the parent pocketed the remaining $1. I felt very bitter after that situation I‚Äôll admit. The next day instead of ice cream there was shaved ice so I bought A and myself shaved ice and nothing for B. It was the most petties thing I‚Äôve ever done. It was even worse because after I handed A theirs B thought the second one was for them but was immediately disappointed when I told them it was mine. I tried some redemption and messaged the parent and said if they sent money I would then buy B some‚Ä¶ but they never responded until the shaved ice truck drove away.

144,1ezw686,AITA for auditioning for a role even though my brother is auditioning for her love interest?,"I know how the title sounds but let me explain, I (14 f) and my brother (16 m) have both been in theatre since I was 7, he started before because he's older and naturally he gets more parts because he's male.

Our school show this year has two female characters and a boatload of male characters, both female characters are madly in love with the same guy, ""Jason"" who my brother has more or less been told he will get the role of. 

I'm entering my freshman year of hs, and with the show's small cast, it's very unlikely I even get ensemble, so I've been drilling the female lead's songs, practicing every monologue from the show, watching every adaptation and preparing for the audition every way possible to have a shot at ensemble.

Here's where the problem began, my brother overheard me singing the female lead's song and, before giving me a word, asks if I'm auditioning for her. I said I was, but didn't expect to get her. immediately after receiving this news, my brother went on a rant about how weird it is that I ""want"" to play his love interest.

Despite my attempts to explain I have no choice if I want to be in the show but to audition for her, he refuses to speak with me about the show and has started to involve my parents.

So, reddit, AITA?

Edit: just to clarify, the most sexual thing between the characters is kissing while dancing, which can easily be removed since it's only in the Broadway script ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-24,"AITA for auditioning for a role even though my brother is auditioning for her love interest?

My sister was 7 minutes away from school by foot, but my mom didn't want her to do that for safety reasons. So she pulled her out. Fast forward to now, my sister wants to go to school physically. She missed ACT's and really important junior activities. So now my sister kind of doubts herself. Tonight we were talking about college and my sister said she probably won't get into a good college. My mom said "" the past is the past, we can't do anything about it"". So all I said was ""well mom I think she saying.."" then I looked at my mom's face and I could tell she didn't want me saying any advice. The energy shifted and I felt so bad. I said ""nvm, I'll keep my comments to myself"". My mom proceeds to say ""what are you talking about, I didn't do that face toward you""... but I know she did. She then asked me what school did you go to? I did the zipped lip motion and became silent. I feel like my mom gets offended by my sister expressing how disappointed she is because my mom didn't do her due diligence. I can disburse money to my mom, and help her with my younger siblings, however when I have some advice, she becomes super defensive.

He has a troubled past, A bit like mine if i do say so myself and i do see myself in him a bit. 
His dad got arrested after scamming his customers, and he never got along with his Mom and Twin sister, He was only really close with his dad. 
I never liked my mom either, So i decided to be some sort of big brother figure to him. 
He would always follow me around and it was obvious he grew attached to me, So did i. I would always give him advice and stuff like that, His mom is very neglectful of him so I decided to take over raising him, Even though i also had issues with my mother and was too young to understand the world better, I wanted to be something to the kid. 
But the problem is, The kid has a friend that's a year younger than him (18M) and these two are total complete opposites. 
My friend is very mature and i honestly never saw him playing with toys when he was younger, Never once i've seen this kid cry either, Also he has a girlfriend (not important to the story). His friend is very childish and OVERLY sensitive that im afraid that this kid is holding him down or just doing everything for attention. 
My friend absolutely adores him too, It worries me a lot that his friend is just seeking out for attention.
They are childhood friends too, He was around 5 when i first met him as a 12 year old. I remember one time this 5 year old got mad at my friend for hanging out with me and threw their friendship bracelets down a sewer drain, and started to cry out of ""Regret"" or whatever. Put a bad impression on me especially that my friend went out of his way to get it, He asked me to help but i refused since i believed that his friend should do what he caused. 

Anyway, The kid would hide the fact he and the other kid were friends from me. He told me i was ""Overbearing"" and to ""Mind my business"" which i would respect, But this kept on happening and it was annoying how he didn't trust me. It got to a point where those two did stop being friends for a few years but then my friend cut me off and became friends with the kid i dislike. 

Time skip, I'm at a party and I see my old friend at the side yard smoking a cigarette, So i offer a lighter and we started to talk. We rekindle our friendship and all that.

He always kept me at arms length ever since we rekindled and he just said ""If you don't like who i'm friends with, then we should just stop talking"" and those words are really eating me up.

At our home we have an ""Absolutely no soliciting, unless you are selling girl scout cookies"" sign directly next to our front door knob/bell.

I noticed you had an ADT sign in the yard and a Ring camera and I'm with (company).."" I immediately cut him off and said, ""Ohhh, is reading part of their training process?"" And proceed to point to the sign so close to where we are standing in the door frame I don't even have to extend my arm from my body then say, ""Thanks, but please leave and have a nice night."" And shut the door. I make it about 3 strides into my living room and the doorbell rings... I re-open the door and he immediately states (literally) ""You don't have to be an asshole."" My rebuttal is, ""Well, it's blatantly posted we don't want soliciting and you are here attempting to sell something, and I've already asked you to leave.

At our home we have an ""Absolutely no soliciting, unless you are selling girl scout cookies"" sign directly next to our front door knob/bell.

I noticed you had an ADT sign in the yard and a Ring camera and I'm with (company).."" I immediately cut him off and said, ""Ohhh, is reading part of their training process?"" And proceed to point to the sign so close to where we are standing in the door frame I don't even have to extend my arm from my body then say, ""Thanks, but please leave and have a nice night."" And shut the door. I make it about 3 strides into my living room and the doorbell rings... I re-open the door and he immediately states (literally) ""You don't have to be an asshole.""

Anyway today (2 days before her birthday), she just starts going on a rant. Talking about how her birthday is shit and shes never going to get her golden birthday back. So I said well what did i do?? And then she got upset saying she knew i would hold the things I did over her head. I said I‚Äôm not holding anything over your head, but why did i even try/go out my way if you were going to be ungrateful. We ending up having this whole fight.

Anyway after the funeral she sent me a bill of $1500 for the passport, ticket and a pendant of my Dad's thumbprint I got as part of the funeral package
Fast forward noone can find a will, she got a court order and gets everything, an 800k+ house freehold, over 100k in cash assets, a piece of land my Dad put his heart and soul into that he wanted as his legacy for the family as well as all my dad's personal effects, she has never once offered if my brother and I would like to see if there was anything personal we would like to collect, never mind anything else, there is also a statue he carved that was always meant to go to me and she is questioning whether that was ever the case but literally everyone knew it was to go to me. 
Anyway she sent me a message this morning asking about the $ & I wrote back saying I hadn't made any payments bcs my husband and I are off work injured & lost 40% of our income until we get back to work & barely make ends meet, I also mentioned how Dad always said in the event of his passing we were looked after and his half of everything would go to us kids, now I owe her money for getting his granddaughter to his funeral? I still haven't even collected the statue because it sits in the lounge room and I thought it would be upsetting for her and there was no rush, I ended it with saying I'd set something up for $10 a week, she wrote back about not believing the statue was mine but I could have it and I'm not sure what else cause I haven't opened the other messages, I was shaking for over an hour about my message as I hate confrontation and it was just not something I wanted to be thinking about/arguing about.

155,1ezuhdv,AITA for telling a friend‚Äôs friend we are not friends? ,"i (16m) have a friend group that ive known for some years, around 7 people and we all go to the same school, but i'm closer with 2, M(16m) and S(16m)

recently, M got in touch with an old childhood friend, ill call him R(17m), his mom used to work for R's parents and they met when they were little, and now have been hanging out together.

i dont really like this guy. ive tried to like him but idk we arent compatible as friends. M has been including him in our group's hangout and when we r with S, everyone likes him and hes cool to hang out like that, a big group and whatever, i dont mind.
im not gonna call him weird but he doesnt rlly know how to socialize? he has been homeschooled his whole life and his parents r super overprotective, i dont wanna call em rich cuz i dont know if they are, our friendgroup is not though.
he has tried to get closer to us and everyone likes him so i feel bad that i dont.

here is the problem. two days ago me and M, S and R were hanging out at M's house until i had to go back to mine for the night, S stayed at M's because his house was too far away, so me and R had to walk back together, we dont live in a dangerous area so we can walk at night like this. We took our stuff and left.

We were quiet for half of the way, until R started. he talked a lot by himself but in summary he said how grateful he was for hanging out with our group and that he finally was going out more and had people to rely on. i dont remember the exact words cuz i was tired and it was long. then he started saying how he thought i was cool but he couldnt come close to me because he thought that i didnt like him, i started paying attention but not talking to him, he continued on his own rant saying how he tried to get me to like him but i never ""fell for him"" or something like that. he was getting a bit mad here, like frustrated. that i always played dumb about him (which i didnt understand?)

i admit i was not thinking correctly and i told him with no offense but we weren't friends, that he was only the guy my friends were friends with.

he stopped for a second and looked at me kinda weirdly like i was saying something bad, we stayed quiet for a bit, he looked like he was about to cry, im not good at comforting so i just told him i thought he was cool and all but that i simply didnt wanna be friends.

we finished the walk until we had to separate, i told him to text in the groupchat when he got home but he only said goodnight and left. he did.

next day i stayed home from school for some medical check ups and M called me around 11am, telling me that R had told him what had happened, that i was super rude about it and he genuinely thought i was mad. ive been told im not good at expressing feelings and i come out as a bit harsh so maybe thats why he understood it like that. M was a bit mad at him and i apologized to him, but i told him R was also being a bit weird abt it which he understood. 

So now im just kinda..? i havent talked abt this with my dad or his gf so yeah

157,1ezu118,AITA for not wanting my mother in the delivery room,"I (26 F) am pregnant with my first child due in September. At the start of my pregnancy I was sure that I wanted my mom in the room with me and my fiance when I was giving birth. However since the beginning of my pregnancy my mother has been disrespectful of the boundaries I have been setting with my pregnancy and for when the baby comes. It all started with her not listening when I told her that I didn't want people kissing my baby other then my fiance and myself with her saying ""Oh but that doesn't apply to me does it"". Then it moved onto when ever I saw her she is rubbing my belly without asking and as I have gotten bigger the skin on my belly has gotten incredibly sensitive and it hurts when someone rubs it too much which she normally does. Then when it came to planning my baby shower she got mad at me because I had asked a coworker to help with the decorations for the party with her saying ""well I guess there is nothing I can help with anymore"" (she never actually helped with the decorations) so I told her she could help with food seeing as it was a potluck, I feel like I should preface this next part with the fact that I have an older brother who is her golden child and the fact that she lives on government aid, all I asked her to bring was pasta salad and a dessert akin to a cheesecake that is topped with fresh fruit, my brother mad a joke about if it didn't have kiwi that he wasn't going (im allergic to kiwi) so I said that she should make two smaller ones, one with kiwi one without and she said that she was just going to do one with half having kiwi and none on the other half, she then said that she was going to make and bring my brothers favorite salad which I hate and when I said that I didn't want it there she fought me on it and then brought a giant ceaser salad instead which I didn't even ask her to bring along with a big thing of store bought brownies and a couple massive bags of chips, she then proceeded to tell me that she went way over budget and that she hoped I was going to like my party but also she went over budget because she just HAD to get a new dress because she didn't have anything to wear. Come the day of the shower she get there over an hour late with neither of the dishes I asked her to bring finished she forgot the dressing for the pasta salad and the ceaser salad and had to pull one of my friends into the kitchen area to help her finish which felt like it took 30 minutes if not an hour to finish, by the time she finally sat down to eat we had to start the party games if we wanted to keep on schedule because we had limited time in the hall that I rented (I didn't think it would take more then 3 hours so its kinda my fault that we had the room for such a short time) so once the first two games were done we started the third and by that time we had 30 minutes left in the room and hadn't even started cleaning up so while the game was going on my dad, brother and fiance and I started cleaning up we didn't even have enough time to open any of the gifts that my friends had brought which had me upset. My mothers reason for being late was that my dad and brother didn't pick her up and forgot about her but when I asked my dad where she was when I got there he said that they stopped to get her and that she wasn't ready so the left and would be back to get her when she was ready (I believe my dad), my dad, brother, mother and one of my friends came back to mine and my fiances house to open the presents and have the desert I asked her to bring, when opening the present from my bestie whom I lovingly call my wife and the God mother of my child her and her fiance who is like a brother to me got my fiance and I matching soft fuzzy sweater things that we now call our fuzzys, when my mother saw them she asked to hold it so I let her, she then proceeded to ""joke"" about not giving it back when I asked for it back to put it back in the bag and has now insisted that she has to go out and get one for herself, her and I had previously had a fight because my father is in a different financial situation and could afford to buy more stuff for the baby which she doesn't like saying that he's trying to compete with her which he isn't, he's just super excited because this is going to be his closest grand baby seeing as my two oldest siblings live in a different part of the country with their kids and spouses (they are from his first wife) I also happen to be his youngest so he is really excited. The day after the party my mother called and said that she had really over done it on the food which I confirmed for her that she had and she said that she couldn't afford her phone bill now it almost felt like she was trying to guilt me into paying for her $50 phone plan which I didn't do instead her and I got into a little argument about the fact that she didn't listen to me and the fact that this all could have been avoided if she just had, this fight resulted in me not talking to her for a couple of days. This whole pregnancy we have gone through periods of not talking because we would have an argument, like when I had an ultrasound and my dad was in the process of leaving the hospital and saw my fiance walking in and was able to come to the appointment with us and find out the gender (it was a total case of right place right time) but she got really mad about that so I brought her to one of my OBGYN appointments where she got to hear the heart beat to try and make it up to her. Her and I have a history of butting heads really badly when one of us is under alot of stress mainly when I am under alot of stress because I just don't have the patience to put up with her bull puckie. With that in mind the other day I told her that there was a possibility that I might ask her to leave the delivery room and have my bestie step in, she proceeded to say that she wouldn't leave the room if I asked her to to which I replied that my fiance said he would make her leave if I didn't want her in there anymore, that was apparently the wrong thing to say to her because she started going off on me saying that if I kicked her out of the room she would leave the hospital entirely when all I would want is for her to sit in the waiting room, she said that all she would be trying to do is make me smile but when she's tried to make me smile in the past in situations where I'm super stressed shes just made it worse and has caused me to flip out which she then uses against me to me me feel like an a hole, she also said that the main reason she wants to be in the room is so that she can experience an natural birth because she never got to experience it before. So after I ended that lovely phone call that just had me feeling like I was doing something wrong by wanting to be surrounded by people that properly support me and won't stress me out I came to the decision that I don't want her in the room with me while I am actively pushing out my baby. When I called her the next day to tell her about it she started on what I must say was a very impressive but ineffective guilt trip. Saying that I broke her heart, that I lied to her, that I promised here from the beginning that she would be in the room the whole time, that she thought that it was just going to be me, my fiance and her in the room and no one else and then the really big thing she said was that my birth MY birth waking going to be ""special"" because she wasn't going to be there in the room with me while I was pushing. I got quite upset with her and quickly ended the phone call then sat there and cried for 30 minutes and texted my bestie everything. My mother called me back a couple hours later and when I confronted her about it because she was acting like nothing was wrong she tried to deny that she had ever said that which led to a bigger fight which I quickly tried to end my hanging up, I then called her later to ask about picking up some furniture for the baby and we were having a clam conversation up until she said that even if she wasn't in the room when I was pushing she would be out in the hall or in the doorway to the room (you can't stand in the hall when someone is actively delivering a baby for privacy reasons) which I stated to her and she tried to play it off like she was joking. At this point I've just gotten tired of all her bull puckie and I don't even think I want her at the hospital at all when I'm delivering my child. I've talked to multiple of my friends and closest family members and they say that she is in the wrong but she just has such a way of making me feel like the bad guy that I just don't know anymore.

Then when it came to planning my baby shower she got mad at me because I had asked a coworker to help with the decorations for the party with her saying ""well I guess there is nothing I can help with anymore"" (she never actually helped with the decorations) so I told her she could help with food seeing as it was a potluck, I feel like I should preface this next part with the fact that I have an older brother who is her golden child and the fact that she lives on government aid, all I asked her to bring was pasta salad and a dessert akin to a cheesecake that is topped with fresh fruit, my brother mad a joke about if it didn't have kiwi that he wasn't going (im allergic to kiwi) so I said that she should make two smaller ones, one with kiwi one without and she said that she was just going to do one with half having kiwi and none on the other half, she then said that she was going to make and bring my brothers favorite salad which I hate and when I said that I didn't want it there she fought me on it and then brought a giant ceaser salad instead which I didn't even ask her to bring along with a big thing of store bought brownies and a couple massive bags of chips, she then proceeded to tell me that she went way over budget and that she hoped I was going to like my party but also she went over budget because she just HAD to get a new dress because she didn't have anything to wear. Come the day of the shower she get there over an hour late with neither of the dishes I asked her to bring finished she forgot the dressing for the pasta salad and the ceaser salad and had to pull one of my friends into the kitchen area to help her finish which felt like it took 30 minutes if not an hour to finish, by the time she finally sat down to eat we had to start the party games if we wanted to keep on schedule because we had limited time in the hall that I rented (I didn't think it would take more then 3 hours so its kinda my fault that we had the room for such a short time) so once the first two games were done we started the third and by that time we had 30 minutes left in the room and hadn't even started cleaning up so while the game was going on my dad, brother and fiance and I started cleaning up we didn't even have enough time to open any of the gifts that my friends had brought which had me upset. My mothers reason for being late was that my dad and brother didn't pick her up and forgot about her but when I asked my dad where she was when I got there he said that they stopped to get her and that she wasn't ready so the left and would be back to get her when she was ready (I believe my dad), my dad, brother, mother and one of my friends came back to mine and my fiances house to open the presents and have the desert I asked her to bring, when opening the present from my bestie whom I lovingly call my wife and the God mother of my child her and her fiance who is like a brother to me got my fiance and I matching soft fuzzy sweater things that we now call our fuzzys, when my mother saw them she asked to hold it so I let her, she then proceeded to ""joke"" about not giving it back when I asked for it back to put it back in the bag and has now insisted that she has to go out and get one for herself, her and I had previously had a fight because my father is in a different financial situation and could afford to buy more stuff for the baby which she doesn't like saying that he's trying to compete with her which he isn't, he's just super excited because this is going to be his closest grand baby seeing as my two oldest siblings live in a different part of the country with their kids and spouses (they are from his first wife) I also happen to be his youngest so he is really excited. The day after the party my mother called and said that she had really over done it on the food which I confirmed for her that she had and she said that she couldn't afford her phone bill now it almost felt like she was trying to guilt me into paying for her $50 phone plan which I didn't do instead her and I got into a little argument about the fact that she didn't listen to me and the fact that this all could have been avoided if she just had, this fight resulted in me not talking to her for a couple of days. This whole pregnancy we have gone through periods of not talking because we would have an argument, like when I had an ultrasound and my dad was in the process of leaving the hospital and saw my fiance walking in and was able to come to the appointment with us and find out the gender (it was a total case of right place right time) but she got really mad about that so I brought her to one of my OBGYN appointments where she got to hear the heart beat to try and make it up to her. Her and I have a history of butting heads really badly when one of us is under alot of stress mainly when I am under alot of stress because I just don't have the patience to put up with her bull puckie. With that in mind the other day I told her that there was a possibility that I might ask her to leave the delivery room and have my bestie step in, she proceeded to say that she wouldn't leave the room if I asked her to to which I replied that my fiance said he would make her leave if I didn't want her in there anymore, that was apparently the wrong thing to say to her because she started going off on me saying that if I kicked her out of the room she would leave the hospital entirely when all I would want is for her to sit in the waiting room, she said that all she would be trying to do is make me smile but when she's tried to make me smile in the past in situations where I'm super stressed shes just made it worse and has caused me to flip out which she then uses against me to me me feel like an a hole, she also said that the main reason she wants to be in the room is so that she can experience an natural birth because she never got to experience it before. So after I ended that lovely phone call that just had me feeling like I was doing something wrong by wanting to be surrounded by people that properly support me and won't stress me out I came to the decision that I don't want her in the room with me while I am actively pushing out my baby. When I called her the next day to tell her about it she started on what I must say was a very impressive but ineffective guilt trip. Saying that I broke her heart, that I lied to her, that I promised here from the beginning that she would be in the room the whole time, that she thought that it was just going to be me, my fiance and her in the room and no one else and then the really big thing she said was that my birth MY birth waking going to be ""special"" because she wasn't going to be there in the room with me while I was pushing. I got quite upset with her and quickly ended the phone call then sat there and cried for 30 minutes and texted my bestie everything. My mother called me back a couple hours later and when I confronted her about it because she was acting like nothing was wrong she tried to deny that she had ever said that which led to a bigger fight which I quickly tried to end my hanging up, I then called her later to ask about picking up some furniture for the baby and we were having a clam conversation up until she said that even if she wasn't in the room when I was pushing she would be out in the hall or in the doorway to the room (you can't stand in the hall when someone is actively delivering a baby for privacy reasons) which I stated to her and she tried to play it off like she was joking. At this point I've just gotten tired of all her bull puckie and I don't even think I want her at the hospital at all when I'm delivering my child. I've talked to multiple of my friends and closest family members and they say that she is in the wrong but she just has such a way of making me feel like the bad guy that I just don't know anymore. Sorry for the rambling and jumping all over this has just really upset me. AITA",,0.03955550864338875,0,0
158,1eztrzc,AITA for telling my mom off for yelling at me after I had just gotten off of work?,"I really just need to vent but any advice is appreciated. I‚Äôll probably delete this post in a few days since I don‚Äôt like keeping personal posts like this up for long. 

I am 18 years old. I just got a job at the beginning of the month. I originally wanted a summer job since the job I already had didn‚Äôt need me until the fall but because I got a job when summer was almost over, I‚Äôve decided to keep the job during the summer. So in a week I will being going to school full time and working two jobs.

I live with my mom, two brothers, sister and cats. I would say my family is poor, we‚Äôre middle class and have nice things. But my mom is a single parent and we are on government assistance so me getting a job is going to help out a lot with our income.

I don‚Äôt mind helping out with our income. What I mind is my efforts and emotions being belittled by my mother.

Today I got off of work 30 mins late. My mom drives me to and from work because I don‚Äôt have my license or my own car so she had to wait for me to get out. I had a feeling she was going to be upset with me for being late but when I got in the car, she just told me I was going to run into the gas station and get a lottery ticket before we went home.

Well I screwed up getting the ticket and since I made a mistake, she got mad at me. I offered to fix the mistake by giving her two dollars for the ticket but she was still mad and accused me of not listening to her and making the mistake on purpose.

Fun fact about me is that if I get yelled at or am around someone else who is being yelled at, I will cry. I‚Äôm just emotional like that and hate yelling . So when my mom started yelling at me, I started crying. 

When she asked me why I was crying, I told her it was because I had just worked all day and now she was yelling at me for a tiny mistake I had made. That was the wrong thing to say because she in turn called me dramatic and said that working 8-4 wasn‚Äôt that hard and that she didn‚Äôt want to hear that me working was helping her out.

She also said that if I was already stressed out from only working that I was going to be even more stressed out when school and my other job started. But I wasn‚Äôt stressed about working, I was stressed because she was yelling at me.

My mom is always belittling my emotions like that. Whenever I cry I‚Äôm always being dramatic or an attention seeker. I try to show her that I care about her and want to help but she doesn‚Äôt appreciate any of that.

So I‚Äôm asking one, am I the asshole? And two, does anyone have any advice as to how I can not be so sensitive? My mom now won‚Äôt stop calling me a crybaby and also won‚Äôt talk to me. I hate crying in front of her because it makes me feel weak.

160,1eztodo,AITA for fighting with my friend?,"
AITA?

First things first, I (M16) and my friend(?) (M17) have been meeting up sometimes during the night to look at the stars together.
We don't talk at school even though we are both in the same class, I think that's neccessary information to know.

I am a bit of an astrology nerd so I tell him about the constellations and the stories behind them, but the thing is, I accidentally got too comfortable with him.

I'm normally really guarded, like, I don't really talk about myself to him but I guess he kinda figured out alot about me that I didn't intend for him to find out.

Since that point, he's been trying to 'save me' or well, he phrases it as help but I know that he's got it in his head that he has to try to offer me salvation or whatever.

I've been sorta letting him, but its beginning to frustrate me because like.. I don't think he really sees me as human anymore but an object to save? 

I didnt really mind it at first because I don't really see myself as human in the first place but it began to really get on my nerves after a while because he just started to have a whole narrative inside his mind of me.

We had a really bad argument about it, I basically told him that he knows nothing about me and is just pitying me because hes trying to avoid pitying himself among numerous other things. I brought up some deeply personal stuff to him and I used it against him because I just wanted him to leave already.

He then lashed out back and said it was my fault for denying myself the identity I seek, and that I was just being selfish. It was a whole thing.

In the end I ended up saying something like, ""Why don't you take notes then, (DEEPLY PERSONAL THING ABOUT ME I SHOULDNT HAVE SHARED.). There, something for your idea of me"" and told him to let me know what he had when he was done.

And he kinda got mad at that and was like ""So you can match it like some fucked up chameleon?"" and then he called me pathetic for it.

In the end we both walked away from eachother and I really want to fix things with him but I don't know how. AITA here? Any tips are appreciated pls

166,1ezstdb,AITA for not letting my best friend join a group that puts her in danger?,"I (14f) and my closest friend Maria (14f) have been friends since i transfered to her school earlier in the year. Its safe to say we've bonded well and ive grown a deep connection to her as a person, extremely scared of her leaving and grouping herself with the wrong people. You could say I have a fear of abandonment when it comes to Maria.

Recently, Maria has been offered to join a certain club (not involved with school might i add) and I've been extremely against it. The club has beliefs that myself nor anyone who comes across it should ever associate themselves with. The club promises rewards and sounds nice, but Ive never seen the appeal. The people involved in the club are trying to trick Maria and her na√Øve self into joining, Maria not even noticing their demenor and how what they're doing is wrong.

I'd never control Marias entire life, i just want to look out for her. Shes my dearest friend who I'd genuinely go back in time for just to stop her from joining this god damn club. I've continously tried telling the group members to leave Maria out of their cult-like activities, but they continue to sprout nonsense on how Maria is 'such a perfect fit' and how she has so much potential. I'm sick of their BS and would do anything for them to leave my best friend alone.

167,1ezsq1l,AITA for cussing out someone for bringing alcohol to my recovering alcoholic sister?,"This happened today, I was working my 3rd shift job when ,long story short, my mom texted me to check on my sister (my sister was using my moms car, which has location tracking) because she wasn't responding and her car was located at what looked like a factory or something. 

I leave work and call the cops, fearing the worst, but on the way to the location my mom told me that the car looked like it was back at her house. I told her to send me the address so I can check on her. When I get there, she is visibly drunk and is chilling with some guy. We talk for a little bit and I left (I have not been in this situation before and regret leaving her alone with some guy) , I told her to call me if she needs anything and I go back to work.

I finished my shift at 11:00, she calls me around 11:30 and ask me to take her to work, we talk for a little bit, long conversation short, she is late for work and says that she has not been late to work ever since she stopped drinking (it has been a couple weeks, maybe a month or so I think). 

I ask her what happened and at this point I find out that her good friend since high school had brought wine to her house, drank a little then left, to which things spiraled downhill after that. 

I drop her off at work, get her friends number from my mom (they are close enough friends that my mom has her number) make sure that I have the right person then I go to bed, wake up and send her a text calling her a piece of shit because she knew that my sister struggled with alcohol and still brought some to her, then I told her to go fuck her self. 

After finding out who I was, she sent a text saying that my sister is her own person and that I should not be blaming her for how my sister gets when she drinks, I clarified that I did not blame her for how my sister acts when drinking, I blamed her for bringing wine to her house knowing that she is recovering , I compared it to dangling carrots and told her that she is part of the problem and that she needed to grow up and take responsibility. 

Had my sister gone out on her own and got drunk I would not have blamed anyone but herself. But this was someone she was close to and knew what she was going through and made the conscious decision to put her in a situation where she would relapse. She is not fully responsible, but she is not absolved of any responsibility either. She knew. 

I do not think what I said was wrong or out of line, but I have never been in this situation before so I don't know. The friend called me disrespectful and my sister Said that my text was a little harsh and my response was disrespectful while also taking responsibility for her actions.

I told him to not answer anymore personal questions about me, if they have a question they can ask me. it pissed me off because I earn almost triple the amount he pays his own son! I don't care about pay or money or anything but he's one to talk about ""earning more"". mind you, my bf is on my side every convo they have, he's my number one supporter.
they're very sweet people, but they like to downplay everything about me almost every chance they get. I try to distance myself from that kind of negativity but they're his family and I don't want to ruin our relationship.

170,1ezsd40,AITA for telling my dad ‚Äòhow to run his marriage‚Äô? ,"AITA for telling my dad ‚Äòhow to run his marriage‚Äô? 

Me (22F), my dad (50‚Äôs M) and my mom (50‚Äôs F) were talking about a situation that happened a couple years ago, which started this current situation. 

Basically a family friend and my mom got into a comment war on Facebook over some political post, where the family friend said some really rude stuff against my mom. At the time, my dad told my mom to please delete the post, and once the post was deleted my dad sent a DM to the family friend trying to calmly assert himself. The family friend apologized but ended up blocking us all afterward. 

Anywho, as we‚Äôre talking about that situation over dinner I say to my dad ‚Äúpersonally I don‚Äôt think you should‚Äôve told mom to delete it, cause it was her post and she should‚Äôve kept it up if she believed in what the post was saying‚Äù. In our household it‚Äôs always been common to share opinions in a civil way, so this is totally normal and has always been our dynamic. 

My dad then explained his reasoning more and he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs not as if I didn‚Äôt defend my wife at all‚Äù, and I agreed with him. I said ‚ÄúI can understand your position and yes, of course you defended her, you sent the family friend a DM‚Äù. 

He then tried to claim that the family friend was only being rude about the post and not my mom herself, which isn‚Äôt true. The family friend was in fact throwing personal insults towards my mom. I corrected him on this, and my mom agreed. Simple as that, nothing insulting said. 

 5 minutes later in the kitchen he accuses me of butting into their marriage and trying to ‚Äòrun his marriage‚Äô, which is completely not true and doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me. He then tries to explain that ‚Äòthings were tense‚Äô back then and that everyone was going through a hard time.

At this point I‚Äôm not even sure why he continued to explain things to me because I didn‚Äôt care, this situation happened years ago, why should it matter now?? I asked him why the situation was so bothersome to him, and he said ‚Äúafter you said I didn‚Äôt defend my wife I let my emotions fester, I needed a moment to process‚Äù, which I guess is fine but‚Ä¶why let the emotions fester?? Why not just say in the moment that I hurt his feelings? Like he didn‚Äôt have to wait 5 minutes giving me angry glares, he could‚Äôve just said I hurt his feelings in the moment and I would‚Äôve said sorry. 

Idk, maybe I just don‚Äôt understand how men‚Äôs emotions work sometimes. I feel like I‚Äôm generally pretty good with empathy but I just can‚Äôt seem to understand what I did wrong here. I‚Äôm hoping you guys may help me to understand. I do love my dad so I‚Äôd like to understand more where he‚Äôs coming from so that we can have better communication in the future.

I didn‚Äôt exactly want to do this, since he relies on me to drive him to campus, and he likes to spend a LOT of time with me so school is an escape for me, but I agreed since it was one day a week. 

I took creative writing my first semester and met a lot of friends, a small group of us formed a friend group and we still talk but rarely in person, mostly online. I‚Äôm also fond of the professor who teaches that class, I took English with him both my first semester and this semester. 

I found out almost everyone in that friend group was taking the second level creative writing class with the same professor but by the time I found out it was too late and all the spots were full, I was disappointed but able to cope with it. 

This week was our first week of school, and I asked the professor if there was an opening in the creative writing class, and he said he could hook me up with one. In order to switch though, I‚Äôd have to drop the core class I‚Äôm taking with my BF. 

I told him the news and said that we could either switch to a different time together, both drop the class and take it next semester, or he could stay where he‚Äôs at and I could switch to creative writing. At first he was upset by all three options but then said the first two would be okay, but I‚Äôd be selfish and inconsiderate if I left him to take the core class alone. 

He‚Äôs part of a disability program that helps him through school and needs to reach out to his counselor to ask if he‚Äôs even allowed to drop the class. Neither of us know when they might reach back out. I want to tell my professor I want a spot in the class as soon as possible so I don‚Äôt miss out, but my BF doesn‚Äôt want me making any moves until he knows he can drop that class, and told me I ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù take the writing class if he can‚Äôt drop our other class. He said sometimes I just need to cut my losses and accept that I‚Äôm going to miss out on things I really want to do.

So a bulk of the housework falls onto me and i'm fine with that but when my wife is home we share duties, I also always ensure my wife has healthy nutritionally dense meals to see her through her long shift, and when we took in my nephews of course that expanded to include them. 

It was an uphill battle to get them to eat well as there was lots of food insecurity when my sister wasn't in Rehab and we've been working with a child psychologist to help them. We are finally making progress of course there are still bad days or days they'd rather have frozen nuggets they're still kids but we're getting there. 

They had a visit with my sister today and I was going to be there with them, we were taking them to the park so I packed lunch for the four of us. They had a good time, there was some uncertainty about being around their mother but it quickly fled when they got to go play. During lunch however my sister had to excuse herself and when she came back it was clear she'd been crying. Neither of us drew attention to it in front of the kids but when I was getting them settled into my Car I took a moment to talk to her. 

She admitted that seeing the lunches I made for them and how i'd managed to get them to eat so well, it made her feel like even more of a failure as even on her best days she couldn't do that. I told her that her care had looked different than mine because she wasn't well and she was trying to get better now that was what mattered, but she told me she didn't think even if clean she could be like this. We talked for a bit longer and I told her to call me later. 

She didn't call me and my call is currently not being answered, The boys are settled in bed and i'm currently waiting for my wife to come home from her shift in a few hours so we can talk about it. I just feel bad about this, I wasn't showing off or trying to rub it in her face, I made them what my wife got as it's easier for meal prepping, maybe I should have considered my sisters feelings though and just gone with sandwiches?

She admitted that seeing the lunches I made for them and how i'd managed to get them to eat so well, it made her feel like even more of a failure as even on her best days she couldn't do that. I told her that her care had looked different than mine because she wasn't well and she was trying to get better now that was what mattered, but she told me she didn't think even if clean she could be like this. We talked for a bit longer and I told her to call me later. 

She didn't call me and my call is currently not being answered, The boys are settled in bed and i'm currently waiting for my wife to come home from her shift in a few hours so we can talk about it. I just feel bad about this, I wasn't showing off or trying to rub it in her face, I made them what my wife got as it's easier for meal prepping, maybe I should have considered my sisters feelings though and just gone with sandwiches?

Edit: I realised I never included the lunch which is a mistake when the post is about that. I made the boys and us some chicken salad, with fruit, some cheesy bread, and they each had a banana muffin",0.0,1.0534591674804688,1,0

I also curse I think it‚Äôs natural but I don‚Äôt do it in front of the kids to teach them good manners.

Yesterday my son was telling my husband about a kid at school that bullies him and my husband called the kid a bastard and I said ‚Äúlanguage.‚Äù And my husband ignored me. Then he went on ‚ÄúThat son of a bitch shouldn‚Äôt be bullying people.‚Äù I gave him a firm look and he stopped and continued eating. I understood he was mad about the bully but he could‚Äôve chose a better vocabulary.

Later , I overhead my son on the phone telling his friend he was a son of a bitch, I was furious and told him to not curse like that , so I went to my husband and told him that his son was learning his preppy vocabulary. My husband apologized but he said it was natural to curse and that he couldn‚Äôt always control what came out his mouth. I told him that maybe he needed to be grounded too.

She said she didn‚Äôt want to deal with the stress and sleep deprivation of it and decided to do pharmacy school instead. I just think she got scared of the commitment and work involved.

He and I talked and I made a jab at her that she was a failed pre-doctor so she‚Äôs trying to marry one and she got really angry. She came over the next day without him and yelled at me for being an asshole and started trying to give me shit for not even graduating college.

I had dreamed of going to the city but I was quite embarrassed by this dream. This changed after seeing an idol perform in the city where I got really excited about them to the point of even telling my little brother¬†we'll call H¬†about them. I played it off as a joke because I felt that my dreams were unattainable, and my father was an important person back home who I had to one day succeed. The people in my hometown often put down my m brother, calling him dumb or other insults because his purpose was to aid me, though I simply wished for him to enjoy his life how he wanted to. When I was 17 i ran away from home to finally see how the city was like. There I met my best friend while looking for a place to stay, and skipping over some parts, he chose join me in entertainment industry and we were a duo for quite a while until we were recruited by an agency. There we ended up joining a unit of 4. The issue is that my little brother H followed after me years later, trying to bring me back home. He didnt know anything about societal norms at all and ever since I left home, our relationship has been quite strained. Convinced idols were what was preventing me from coming back he wouldn't give up as my fathers health was getting really bad. I distanced myself from him and threw down his attempts at convincing me. My actions were ultimately to guarantee my brothers safety and freedom, and I went far as to disown him to keep him away from the village, and go back instead of him.

177,1ezs2gi,AITA for making my friend break up with his girlfriend?,"Recently, my friend‚Äôs girlfriend texted me asking, ‚Äúif your gf wanted Jordans would you get them for her?‚Äù I replied, ‚Äúyes 100%,‚Äù and then she asked ‚Äúso would you also get flowers for her?‚Äù I replied, ‚Äúofc no question.‚Äù She then started talking about my friend and how he had never gotten her anything in the 5-6 months that they‚Äôve been together, not even on National Girlfriend day. 

At first I was defending my friend, but it seemed like what I was giving her was not what she wanted to hear. 30 minutes into the conversation and I am convinced that she just does not want to be with him, she has said half a dozen times by now that ‚ÄúI will break up with him, just not right now.‚Äù She tells me things about him and their relationship, and I tell her about the things that he had told me while they were together. 

One key part of this conversation was that my friend would always find some kind of gift when he was with his ex, but never for his latest relationship. I‚Äôve heard of all the times she spent money on him, hundreds of dollars yet he never gave a single thing back. Matter of fact, I‚Äôve spent more money on her than he did. He also has so much free time, all he does is workout, (he looks amazing), he doesn‚Äôt have a job, and he just does chores around the house. 

They ended up breaking up that night. This is not the full story, I did lie to his girlfriend and it was hard to convince her that I did.

I feel like I am the asshole, I tried to apologize twice already yet he doesn‚Äôt even want to work a way to resolve what happened.

178,1ezs20u,AITA for refusing to tell my sister the name of the family member who said she was choosing a guy over her little sister? ,"I(19f) was living with my sister Sia(27) for high school and 1st year of college but she gave me an ‚Äúultimatum‚Äù that I need to either get a job or go to community college otherwise I have to move out. 
Originally my deadline was the end of the year but she told me this late December so she extended it to early January. I couldn‚Äôt do either. I was getting no luck with my applications even though I applied at any place hiring from down the street to a mile away. And with the major that I picked, if I went to community college I would have to redo everything once I got to the school I wanted to go to. 
It felt like I had no choice but to leave anyway but I didn't have anywhere to go besides moving back in with our mom. Our mom wasn‚Äôt in a stable living situation which was the reason I was sent to live with Sia. 

i planned to go see our mom since I was having anxiety attacks but got sick so i had to wait and so did Sia though with covid. Once I got better I found out the day before I was leaving that Sia had made a sudden last minute trip with her friends the same weekend so I had to stay for the dogs. I was furious since I had been planning this since early this month and she was planning for a few days not even knowing if she would be off covid in time.
I went to my mom‚Äôs anyway just for a day after asking my second sister(27) who lived close by to take care of the dogs while I was away. During the time I was gone, I was told by an adult in my family that Sia had gone around saying before her trip that she was planning on kicking me out by the end of February so she can sleep with her new guy friend freely in an empty apartment. 
I was panicking since we‚Äôre in the last week of February with no place yet so I called my second sister to ask if she heard the same thing to see if it was true. Instead she immediately talked down to me demanding I tell her who told me that calling me naive and immature for listening to someone else‚Äôs words, gossiping about it to Sia once she got back from her trip.  

Two days later I left unannounced early in the morning with my oldest sister(36) because I didn‚Äôt want to be forced to do chores before going mostly because I was the only one doing them since December because of her guy friend. The whole day Sia was calling everyone she knew I was in contact with to figure out where I was, who told me that and ranting about how horrible I had been to her these past few months in her words.
Once I got back we got into an argument about it. I was crying repeatedly asking her do you really care about your pride more than my living situation? She kept responding with yes that‚Äôs exactly what i'm saying in a sarcastic tone, telling me that i'm a emotional liar throwing a tantrum leading to me getting taken away by my oldest sister who watched everything. 

After my birthday she posted about the situation on her tiktok painting us as a disrespectful hating family towards her. I really want to know if I was right or wrong from a non family member
