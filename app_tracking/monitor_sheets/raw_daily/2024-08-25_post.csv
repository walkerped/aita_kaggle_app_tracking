0,1f0qybf,AITA for refusing to name our non-existent future child after our current dog?,"Hello
The title basically sums it up, it’s a little silly and we are both aware of it.

Today while driving my SO brought up baby names. (We are two non-binary lesbians and don’t have the parts to make this happen without a shit ton of planning, so no actually threat of a baby anytime soon btw) 

We were throwing baby names around and my SO brought up the name of our current dog, who is 12 years old.

There’s nothing wrong with the name per say, but I just feel like it’s weird to name a child after a dog? Seems mean to me somehow. My partner asked for a middle name maybe and I said no way.
I know that the dog is super super important to my partner (the fur baby has been with my partner since she was a baby, my partner rescued her way before we got together 2 years ago) and I think it would be nice to memorialize her importance in my partners life, but a baby name seems odd to me.
Idk if I’m over thinking it but I think if future imaginary child found out it could be seen as mean or something they wouldn’t like.

EDIT: due to questions, the name is Fern :)

1,1f0m80g,AITA for telling my mom I don’t like spending time alone with her? ,"My(29f) mom(64f) is very conservative/Christian and has a history of bringing up controversial topics and refusing to let it go when asked. She’s done this multiple times over the years with different topics (politics, religion, lgbt issues, etc) and will not drop it how no matter how much I beg her to. 

A couple of weeks ago, she took me out for lunch and then came over to my house to hang out for a while. She brought up the topic of my nephew(18m) who is trans. I know that she does not approve of him being trans and it caused a big uproar last year leading up to my wedding where my nephew was in the bridal party(I asked him before he came out). I thought I was starting to make some progress with her. I tried to explain that he is an adult and I don’t feel like it’s my place to say what he can and can’t do with his life/body and I’m just going to love him because he’s my nephew. However, she wasn’t buying this and doubled down by bringing up two of my other close friends and bridesmaids who are lesbian and bisexual. She said that by not condemning them and allowing them to “live in sin” that they’re more important to me than God’s laws. I said that no, I’m following God’s law of loving others because I feel that it’s important to be like Jesus and to love everyone regardless of where they are in life because it isn’t my business to judge them. This started to escalate and we were both yelling when I finally said “this is why I don’t like hanging out with you alone!” She stormed out and hasn’t spoken to me since.

I don’t feel like I’m in the wrong since, even though it wasn’t the nicest way to say it, it was something that needed to be said. My husband(36m) is on my side and now understands why I don’t often spend time alone with her. She generally holds it together in a group but not when she has me 1-on-1 but now his eyes are opened to how she can be. 
It seems like my dad(70m) doesn’t feel the same, which is probably the hardest for me since he doesn’t usually let stuff with my mom come between us but he hasn’t talked to me either. 

I know what I said was unkind but I can’t handle being backed into corners like this all the time…. So, was I the asshole for telling her that her actions make me not want to spend time with her alone anymore?

2,1f1a9m4,AITA for not cleaning the bathroom?,"My husband and I have no set arrangement on cleaning. In theory it is shared. I have a strong suspicion I do a lot more, but he DOES do all the outside stuff and car maintenance so I figure it is about even. We have no agreement that I'll clean bathrooms, but I don't think I've ever seen him clean one unless asked and then he grumbles.

 Here's the issue - we have a guest bathroom I almost never use. I mean, I rarely even walk in there. He uses it a lot. I keep our shared ensuite bathroom spic and span, but it frankly rarely even occurs to me to clean the guest bathroom. It gets pretty gross, especially since he also bathes his dog, cleans his shoes etc in the tub. And that is also the only place he shaves, which means little fine hairs all over everything..

The other day he had company over and after they left he noticed that the bathroom they used was not very nice - he thinks I should just clean it at the same time as our bathroom. He was also miffed because I knew it wasn't clean and didn't give him a heads up.  I think since I don't use it I shouldn't have to clean it (and I didn't deliberately leave it to embarass him, because it also embarasses me to have guests see that).

4,1f19vqv,AITAH for telling my brother I won't lend him money?,"I (33F) have a twin brother (33M) well call him Ken, I also have been with my husband (36M) for a total of 13 years, well call him John. 

Ok, so I hadn't talked to Ken for a few years at one point, he has been living a kind of chaotic life style since he got divorced a few years ago. He also has 3 kids he hasn't really seen for about 2 years. Ken only tells me he doesn't have the money to drive the 10 miles to see them, I have told him to take the bus since that's free where he lives, and Ken still told me no. I'm sure there's more to that story but he won't tell me the whole story. 

He has been evicted from his place, my dad has told him that he can move in with him but again he has refused. So again more to the story that we don't know about, but he has constantly asked me for money for the past year and I've always told him no, I've explained that John is our only income. I am a stay at home mom, even though John makes good money, that doesn't mean I can just give money out. John has put me in control of all the money and the finances since he works out of town a lot! So I pay all the bills, do the grocery shopping, and take care of all our kids activities. 

I always leave money in John and my joint account, because even though his job takes care of all his amenities while he out of town, I like him to always have access to money at all times. Plus it helps our account to always have money in it too. 

Well Ken asked me for a few hundred dollars and again I said no, because he never tells me what's going on in his life to either need the money or what he's struggling with. Plus even though I am the one taking care of the money and finances this is still something I would talk to my husband John about since he is the one working so hard for us. 

If Ken would tell me about what's going on in his life then maybe I would be more than willing to help, but it's hard when none of us know. Ken called me selfish and hung up on me, but it didn't take long for him to ask me for money again. 

I don't know what to do in this situation, so AITAH for telling my brother I won't lend him money?


Edit to add: THANK YOU everyone for the feedback, about 15 minutes ago from this edit, Ken again texted me and asked me for money, I told him NO, and to not ask me again, I said if you want to talk to me About normal things like just checking in and seeing how everyone is doing is ok.

5,1f19t29,AITA for telling my intern to please leave me alone,"throwaway bc my situationship follows my main and I don't really want him reading this

I (22M) used to work at this really shitty corporate company. When I was there, I had an intern under me who idolized me as a mentor figure. Mind you I did not want him to do that. Anyways, I ended up leaving the company for personal reasons and later joined a small agency. Surprise, I ended up with a part-time intern (18M) AGAIN (idk why or how this keeps happening). Intern #2 is a ray of sunshine and I actually care about his well being (as compared to intern #1, who I low-key hate). I was out for coffee with my new team and ran into intern #1.

Here's where I may have been the asshole. I was in a really bad place mentally at my old job and intern #1 acted like a child 90% of the time, so I wasn't super nice to him. Tbf it was literally NOT MY PROBLEM that he couldn't do his job. As his supervisor, I was responsible for correcting his mistakes but it got really annoying really fast w how incompetent he was. I may have yelled at him a few times because of it, but I didn't say anything that wasn't true. (Let me emphasize again that intern #2 is not only capable of understanding if he's made a mistake but actually capable of improving, something intern #1 clearly lacks.)

Anyways intern #1 and intern #2 stared at each other and it became clear intern #1 was pissy that I'd taken on a new intern (again, I literally left the old company, I don't know why he's mad). When he asked me, I said intern #2 was superior to him in every way imaginable (I really just wanted him to leave me alone). Intern #1 was NOT happy to hear that and I think the two have been arguing on social media for the last few days. (I've looked over intern #2's shoulder at his desk a few times and he tried to hide his screen BUT I did manage to catch a glance at their discussion and it seems pretty extreme for something that started for no reason. Incredibly confident that intern #1 started it just to be a jerk. I don't know why he can't move on when I was very clear about wanting nothing to do with him, and we had no real relationship of any kind.)

6,1f19jwi,AITA for taking away the chair from two women for myself? ,"TLDR: Two women were next to a chair in a park and I asked them if they were using it, and when they said they WERE going to use it, I took it as ""not using them"" and took it for myself anyway.  
  
So for context: I'm a pretty asocial 32 years old dude, live by myself with my dog. Every morning I take my dog to a nearby park that has some wooden chairs that are loose and anyone can grab and use, and I like to sit on one of em to read a book while my dog runs around free (a small yorkshire terrier who was abandoned and I couldn't find the original owners so I adopted him, the walks are more for him than for myself). For the first time in months I go to the park in the afternoon (3 pm) and I notice most chairs are being used except one. One next to two women in her 40s wearing sport clothes. I go to pick the chair and notice their belongings on the floor next to the chair, so I ask them if they are currently using it (I know they weren't, but I ask out of courtesy). They say that they are not using it right now but they are going to eventually. I tell em that I could use em right now and they tell me that i can't because they are going to use it. I don't really care what they are gonna do with it,  the chairs are of public usage, and as I see it they cannot reserve them like this for themselves. My low social skill ass just tell em that they cannot reserve the chairs like that and just grab the chair, take it about 10 meters away from them and sit to read my book. They complain and I think that's gonna be it but they take pictures of me, insult me and I try to argue with them the chair is not theirs, they are for everyone to use and as soon as someone is not sitting on them, they are free for grabs (specially if it's the last chair free in the park, should be used, not reserved to use). They ask me if I would do the same if a family was using them and I reflect and I realize that maybe if a group of people had been using a bunch of chairs and one or two were unoccupied I would do the same. I realize that I probably would ask but not grab it anyway if they tell me I cannot use it, as there's more people to confront me. I admit to them that I probably wouldn't just take it if that was the case. by then they already have insulted me, recorded me, taken pictures of me and told me they know the people that work in the park and they'll get me banned. I know they don't have the authority or the reason to do this but I'm just giving all the context I can. They call me a misogynist and a number of other things which I try to ignore and focus on my book. After good 20 minutes of them complaining non-stop, I decide to grab my things and leave, as it is clear they won't be stopping as long as I'm there. I still cannot help thinking I was a bit of a coward taking the chair from them which I wouldn't have done if it had been a big enough group of people.

They call me a misogynist and a number of other things which I try to ignore and focus on my book. After good 20 minutes of them complaining non-stop, I decide to grab my things and leave, as it is clear they won't be stopping as long as I'm there. I still cannot help thinking I was a bit of a coward taking the chair from them which I wouldn't have done if it had been a big enough group of people.

7,1f19bco,AITA for not spoiling my (25F) girlfriend (24F) on her birthday?,"So, I (25F) have been dating my girlfriend (24F) for a little over a year now. Generally, we get along really well, but there's one area where we seem to clash: how we show appreciation for each other. I’m not really into celebrating birthdays, including my own, and I've always seen them as just another day. I believe that love and appreciation can be shown in everyday actions rather than on special occasions. I've also had some very rough experiences on my birthday, so I'd be happiest not addressing them at all, but I push through because I'm trying to be a good girlfriend.

Leading up to my girlfriend's birthday, she kept dropping hints about how she wanted it to be a special day—like a celebration with gifts, a party, and all the usual fanfare. I heard her, but honestly, I was in the mindset that we could just have a nice dinner together, maybe a movie night, and call it a day.

When her actual birthday rolled around, I planned a nice evening dinner at home and cooked her favorite meal. But I didn’t get her any gifts or have a big celebration because, to me, the dinner was the main event. It's kind of a gift, and she said she'd be happy with any sort of gift that took thought. I took care to make the meal exactly how she likes it, and I even bought her a card.

When she walked in and saw the setup, she got really excited - it was adorable. But when we finished and I started to clean up and start heading to bed, I could see her expression change. I think she was expecting something more because she burst into tears and told me she felt unappreciated and that I didn’t care about her birthday at all. I was taken aback because I thought I’d still shown her I cared with the effort I put into the dinner.

I tried to explain my perspective, but she was too upset, and it turned into a big argument. Now she feels hurt and disappointed, and I feel terrible for not meeting her expectations, but I genuinely thought I was doing something special. Plus, we're low on money and doing the sort of 'free gifts' she's mentioned (playlists, moodboards, poetry) isn't exactly in my wheelhouse.",Asshole,2024-08-25,"AITA for not spoiling my (25F) girlfriend (24F) on her birthday?

8,1f195l9,AITA for telling my mom and aunt to stop telling me about our family problems because I don't care?,"Burner account... Okay, I know how insensitive this sounds but I just can't take this anymore. I'm only fourteen and my mother and aunt are driving me crazy as the only thing they seem to have any complaints about it the way our family works since my grandfather died in November. I would also like to highlight the fact that I am South Asian and if you're also South Asian you might be able to understand what I mean.

My father's side of the family has always been extremely dysfunctional and this has only gotten worse since my grandfather died. Out of all of the six children my grandfather had, none of them turned out normal. My father might just be the worst, while he takes pride in being the most westernized one and saying he didn't end up an awful apathetic person like the rest of the people from our ethnicity, really is just the same. My aunt, my father's sister, long story short- has had a very tragic life and doesn't have a husband or children. I love my aunt but she is still stuck in the past because of what's happened to her and she hasn't done anything in her life. 

 Since my grandfather's passing, things have only gone more and more downhill in my family, and it's genuinely so tiring hearing the same thing over and over again about our dynamic from my mother and aunt. The whole inheritance thing also. My grandfather wasn't literate in English enough to make a will before he passed, so that probably explains itself. My own aunts and uncles had the audacity to bring me, a child, into their arguments and find some way to involve me. I can't take it anymore. From my mother it's ""your father doesn't want to do anything for this family."" From my aunt it's ""I am so helpless I have nothing and everyone is driving me insane."" My aunt... her whole thing is being ""mujbur"" (if you know you know) And my father? He didn't even attend his own father's funeral and could not care less about what was going on. He only yelled and cursed at everyone. Everyone calls each other ""beghairat"" or ""besharam""

Anyway, one day while my mother and aunt were just spouting to me about the same thing again, I just calmly stopped them and asked them to stop telling me about our family problems because I don't care and I don't want to hear about the same thing over and over again. They were shocked by this and just told me I was being cold and insensitive but what can I do?? They've been complaining about the same people, problems, topics, every single day for the past nine months.

I work from home and see her out the window. For the past two weeks I have been going outside to try to make friends with her. She is extremely skinny, has very matted fur and appears to have a respiratory infection-so much so that when she meows snot bubbles come out of her nose. She is the cutest sweetest cat and I was worried about her and the state that she was in. I started feeding her in the hopes that she would start hanging around my house and maybe stay on my porch and I could take care of her. I posted on my local neighborhood group on Facebook to see if she belonged to anyone and she did. It turns out the cat belongs to a neighbor just a block away. The neighbor said the cat was home safe and that if I ever saw the cat again to let her know. I was relieved thinking the cat had just run away and was safe now but also thought it was odd that the person wanted me to keep watching for her cat. Anyway 2 days later I see the cat again…looking as rough and sick as ever. Am I the asshole for wanting to adopt this cat even though she has an owner? I feel like this poor cat deserves better.

12,1f188ve,AITA For asking my husband not to poop in the main bathroom? ,"We have three bathrooms in our house. One is right outside the main living space, the other is in our bedroom and then we have a half bath in the utility hall.

Not only can I sometimes hear him pooping, but it's the only bathroom with an actual bathtub and we give the kids baths after dinner. I don't want to listen to my husband poop and then do baths in a stinky poop smelling bathroom when there are literally two other bathrooms he can use. 

When we moved in together into the house we put the poop stool from his house in the utility bathroom and dubbed it the poop bathroom. Now he just uses the kids foot stool. I have asked him COUNTLESS times to quit pooping in the main bathroom. 

He thinks I am being ridiculous and that he should be able to use whatever bathroom he wants and said it's not that big of a deal.

Carl likes to play League of Legends on his Windows PC, and he is actually quite good at it for his age. But there's one key issue: he has serious anger issues when he loses. Whenever he loses a match, Carl will frequently slam his mouse into the wooden desk, kick the wall, or scream an obscenity. Ever since his father stopped living with us, he has felt dissatisfied with life and just generally angry. He frequently goes to therapy for his anger issues, but he's in the process of recovery, so I try to be as patient as possible. At the very least, I've gotten him to calm down with the obscenities since it interrupts my work as a mid level manager at a sports marketing firm.

Recently, Carl went up to me and asked me to help him create a new account since he got banned for a month and doesn't know what happened. Initially, I assumed the best out of my son as most parents do (for better or worse). I figured it was because of the third party extensions he installs to keep track of things in game. However, as I begin to think about it, something just seemed off. How could a popular in-game extension get him banned for a month?

14,1f184sq,WIBTA if I request we don't tell the in laws our baby has been born until we are ready for everyone to know?,"Sorry, first time posting so hope this is okay!

For some info myself (F28) and my partner (M28) have had issues with pregnancy and miscarriages. We never made family aware we were trying or having issues. We are currently pregnant and although there are complications with myself, baby is healthy. We did want to wait to tell family however by 14 weeks it was becoming difficult to hide.

This will be my in laws first grandchild, when we told them they were over the moon although did ask if this was an accident as we have never mentioned pregnancy unlike his sister (F30). The next day we informed his sister who mostly put on a brave face, made a comment about how at least one of her parents children could produce a child and spent the rest of the evening discussing her issues with not being able to conceive. We did mention that we had previous complications and this pregnancy wasn't going to be straightforward when the comment was made. With both sets of parents and siblings we requested that they do not tell anyone else as we are not ready for wider family to know until we have had further checks.

We usually meet up as a family weekly however the next meet up SIL said she had plans. The parents in law explained she's struggling with our news because of her issues so we explained to them we'd had previous and ongoing complications which is why we didn't want wider family to know about baby yet. We did end up bumping into SIL as she had attended the same event we had as a family, she wouldn't look at me or speak to me. Since then we haven't had a family meet up for the past 2 weeks, nor has any of them checked in to see how things are going.

Thursday evening we received a card in the post congratulating us on our pregnancy from my partner's auntie and uncle! We had not been informed they had been told and the request was to not tell anyone at all. My partner has messaged to ask them and turns out MIL has told all her sisters but 'it's okay' because she's explained we have had previous issues and have complications with this one! I did not want wider family knowing until we knew just how severe the complications are and I certainly didn't want them to know about our private issues. So now I want to ask we don't tell them as soon as baby is born but wait until we are ready for wider family to know. I want us to have a few days to settle before being bombarded with messages from wider family or before anyone visits. It's likely the birth will be quite complicated and I don't think we are being selfish to want a few days to adjust before all of that starts but fear MIL will tell wider family and not respect our request for no visits until we are ready.

This will be my in laws first grandchild, when we told them they were over the moon although did ask if this was an accident as we have never mentioned pregnancy unlike his sister (F30). The next day we informed his sister who mostly put on a brave face, made a comment about how at least one of her parents children could produce a child and spent the rest of the evening discussing her issues with not being able to conceive. We did mention that we had previous complications and this pregnancy wasn't going to be straightforward when the comment was made. With both sets of parents and siblings we requested that they do not tell anyone else as we are not ready for wider family to know until we have had further checks.

We usually meet up as a family weekly however the next meet up SIL said she had plans. The parents in law explained she's struggling with our news because of her issues so we explained to them we'd had previous and ongoing complications which is why we didn't want wider family to know about baby yet. We did end up bumping into SIL as she had attended the same event we had as a family, she wouldn't look at me or speak to me. Since then we haven't had a family meet up for the past 2 weeks, nor has any of them checked in to see how things are going.

Thursday evening we received a card in the post congratulating us on our pregnancy from my partner's auntie and uncle! We had not been informed they had been told and the request was to not tell anyone at all. My partner has messaged to ask them and turns out MIL has told all her sisters but 'it's okay' because she's explained we have had previous issues and have complications with this one! I did not want wider family knowing until we knew just how severe the complications are and I certainly didn't want them to know about our private issues. So now I want to ask we don't tell them as soon as baby is born but wait until we are ready for wider family to know. I want us to have a few days to settle before being bombarded with messages from wider family or before anyone visits. It's likely the birth will be quite complicated and I don't think we are being selfish to want a few days to adjust before all of that starts but fear MIL will tell wider family and not respect our request for no visits until we are ready.

I (14F) was just sitting in my room watching yt when my mom came upstairs and told me to help my little sister with her art project. I didn’t really want to but I didn’t also didn’t want to get in trouble for not helping. 

Apparently my sister was making design for her new phone case, she was supper gluing gems on the back of the case. After about an hour and half I stop to try and wash the super glue off my hands when I realize that there was some on almost every nail. And I ask her if she could pay for my nails to get redone since she told me to help. So I try a d negotiate that I will pay my saved up 25 dollars and asked her to pay the other 37. And again she said no. So I got irritated and stormed off.

16,1f17vcx,AITA for yelling at my partner for borrowing my clothes without asking?,"
For perspective while my partner generally identifies with their birth sex they sometimes feel more feminine or like a girl and will prefer feminine clothes and pronouns etc.

My (19F) partner ""Zane"" (19) and I are both from the same small town. They're not out to their conservative family and so spent a lot of time around mine. Since they're pretty small/scrawny for a boy we're about the same size when it comes to women's clothing and I'd share my clothes with them sometimes when they were in the mood.

We moved away to the same college in NY and the clothes sharing continued because even though were in a way more liberal place now they're still afraid to buy more girly stuff because they're parents still watch their accounts. The problem is there pretty messy and anytime we go out and their in a more feminine mood they get stuff on my clothes and so I only let them borrow certain stuff. Lately they've been kinda just taking stuff without asking. I let it go for a bit because I know they're afraid to buy stuff buttttt yesterday they wasted hot sauce all over one of my favorite blouses.

I admittedly lost it and yelled at them about how they always do this and I hate them borrowing my clothes. They kept apologizing and telling them theyedd get it cleaned. I was still angry and I told to not touch anything of mine without asking again and theyve been kinda closed off since.

By no means it’s a mystery of the century or smth but I don’t like talking about it bc it usually means hearing some unsolicited medical advice.

 But basically I'm in high school and I promised my parents I'd take a SAT practice test every weekend. Apparently my dad said I promised to wake up at 8:00 every weekend last week, I vaguely remember something like that and arguing with my dad but I just let it drop because I didn't have the energy to go through with it. Woke up at around 9 yesterday and 9:40 today.

My parents don't know this but I tend to stay up until around 10:30 to 11:00 on the weekdays and 2-4 am on the weekends, when they think I go to bed around 9 - 10 PM. I know it's not always super good for me but every day they basically expect me to be a machine studying constantly, 8+ hours minimum while they get mad if i play a game or something for 3 - 4 hours.  

I always used to try to listen to them on this kinda stuff and they used to have some level of chill, but over the past few months my brother got a girlfriend outside our religion and they've been trying to double down on me in basically everything to make sure I don't ""turn out like him"". 

I feel like it's gotten really extreme, I have had a bit of an attitude problem and I think I'm trying to do a lot better but they just have no respect for me. Constantly interrogating me for ""progress reports"", yelling at me for getting an A- instead of an A. When I try to set boundaries and ask them to just let me live like a normal high-schooler it usually ends with them saying I'll end up a junkie on the streets and taking away all my electronics.

So all that was the background. Basically today we weren't going our place of worship and I was going to take my practice exam. I was sort of well rested when I woke up, my parents were yelling at me a lot until I got up. I finished all my homework and had literally only the 2 hour long test to do but they still got pissed at me and told me only average people wake up late.

At this point my dad told me I only would have 1 hour of free time the whole day. Looking back he probably meant to provoke me and I fell for it. I basically thought ""fuckit"" and wasted the next 2 hours eating then going to take a dump and shower. When I got out they completely disconnected my console and took away my electronics.

Honestly after reflecting on it I do realize I am at fault somewhat. On one side I feel like my parents steamrolled me and expected me to just do whatever they say.

24,1f16ber,WIBTA For not helping anymore financially?,"

Ever since our mom gave us credit cards she has consistently went into the negative and had to get money put in her card by others, My sister has used weed before but stopped after a bad trip when our mom caught her, she never paid for the weed. Shes isn’t even on drugs anymore, she’s just buying bullshit for the sake of it.

My sister the other night asked me for $2.10 to take her account out of the negative. She said how she got food but didn’t realize she didn’t have enough money. I told her no, she begged. I told her there nothing I can tell her she doesn’t already know, I her younger brother have given her financial advice when  she struggles and she hasn’t took it, I explained how me and our mom aren’t always going to take her out of it, Then told her that she still owes me $10 for photos she asked me to take for her. She said she liked pay me $15 but I lowered it to $10. I said how she needed to save her money more and check her bank account at least once a day and to stop estimating her amount when she literally can check it in 10 seconds. I thought about it for 3 minutes, did the math on if I needed the money for the Game “Sparking Zero”, I would be fine if she didn’t return it. gave her the money and she said I would get it back in the morning, I woke up and she kept her word. 


On to my moms perspective, I was in the car ranting about how she asked me for money to avoid a lecture from her but instead got one from me just for my mom to tell me that she and her friend gave my sister a total of $600 Fucking dollars when she first went to college and she spent it all despite not being in college for more than 2 weeks. That was gift money! We talked and my mom said she love my sister but is sick of paying for her and actually got happier when she moved out.

This post is getting long so here’s the last bit, my sister doesn’t have a job anymore and is a “broke college student”, she says that she expect our mom to give her money so she will pay me with that, I brought this up in our conversation and my mom said that the fact that my sister expects the money and not asking is ridiculous, and she’s not giving her the money. In my mind the money is nonexistent and I’ll get it another way without asking her. Before this my sister asked me for $11 and I straight up told her no, I don’t know if something’s going on but I don’t want her dragging me down with her. 
 


AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-25,"WIBTA For not helping anymore financially? 

Ever since our mom gave us credit cards she has consistently went into the negative and had to get money put in her card by others, My sister has used weed before but stopped after a bad trip when our mom caught her, she never paid for the weed. Shes isn’t even on drugs anymore, she’s just buying bullshit for the sake of it.

My sister the other night asked me for $2.10 to take her account out of the negative. She said how she got food but didn’t realize she didn’t have enough money. I told her no, she begged. I told her there nothing I can tell her she doesn’t already know, I her younger brother have given her financial advice when  she struggles and she hasn’t took it, I explained how me and our mom aren’t always going to take her out of it, Then told her that she still owes me $10 for photos she asked me to take for her. She said she liked pay me $15 but I lowered it to $10. I said how she needed to save her money more and check her bank account at least once a day and to stop estimating her amount when she literally can check it in 10 seconds. I thought about it for 3 minutes, did the math on if I needed the money for the Game “Sparking Zero”, I would be fine if she didn’t return it. gave her the money and she said I would get it back in the morning, I woke up and she kept her word. 


On to my moms perspective, I was in the car ranting about how she asked me for money to avoid a lecture from her but instead got one from me just for my mom to tell me that she and her friend gave my sister a total of $600 Fucking dollars when she first went to college and she spent it all despite not being in college for more than 2 weeks. That was gift money! We talked and my mom said she love my sister but is sick of paying for her and actually got happier when she moved out.

25,1f166h2,AITA for Refusing to Drive My Van After a Terrifying Incident?,"My 2012 Toyota Sienna has over 200,000 miles on it and has recently become unreliable. A few weeks ago, I had a terrifying experience while driving on the highway with my three kids. I needed to urgently switch lanes to avoid an incident up ahead when the car in front of me cut me off and abruptly stopped in the middle of the lane. I swerved to miss them and slammed on the brakes to avoid going off the shoulder and into a ditch. My car came to an abrupt stop midway in the right lane of the highway, and then it just...died. It had no power, wouldn't turn on, and I couldn't even put it into neutral to push it off the highway.

We were literally sitting ducks, with traffic going 65 mph or more, and I was terrified we would be broadsided. As I was calling 911, I was trying to decide if I should have my kids get out of the car and stand on the side of the ditch or if we were safer buckled in the vehicle. It was one of the scariest moments of my life.

A kind man stopped to help me, but even he couldn't get the car to turn on or move. After what felt like an eternity, he managed to get it to start, and it limped onto the shoulder. I was incredibly grateful and called my husband to tell him what had happened and ask him to come and get us so we could tow the van home. To my shock, he refused because he had a Zoom meeting. It was a meeting he attends but doesn't actively participate in, one that he could have easily been excused from.

Feeling completely overwhelmed and not thinking clearly, I ended up driving home in the van. Once home, my husband looked into the issue and believed that the main battery power cord had been disconnected. He cleaned it, tightened the screws, and since then, the van has mostly worked fine.

However, I no longer feel comfortable driving the van. It let me down when I needed it most, putting my children and me at serious risk. We have the money, both in cash and the ability to finance, to get me a used car to replace the van. But my husband thinks that I should continue driving the van because he believes he fixed the issue and that it runs fine now.

I often help my uncle and aunt (through marriage) babysit their five grandkids, who range from five to eleven years old. I don't mind helping out; they're my family, and I love spending time with them.

But there's this one thing that drives me absolutely insane. My aunt's cousin's 7-year-old grandson comes over to join the other kids sometimes. For some reason, he insists on calling my aunt ""Grandma."" It really bothers me because technically, she’s not his grandma—she’s his first cousin twice removed. I know it sounds a bit nitpicky, but it’s important to me that family titles are used correctly.

I asked my aunt why he calls her ""Grandma,"" and she explained that his actual grandma, her cousin, has some personal issues and isn’t really in his life. So, my aunt is the only grandma figure he’s ever really known. I get it, but it still annoys me every time I hear him call her ""Grandma"" because it just feels wrong.

Every time he does it, I correct him and tell him that she’s everyone else’s grandma, not his. But he completely ignores me and keeps doing it. He even stuck his tongue out at me once! It’s like he doesn’t even care about the proper titles. Today, when his mom came to pick him up, I pulled her aside and told her that he was being rude to me.

28,1f15tg4,AITA for making my girlfriend pay rent?,"First time using this sub, so sorry if anything is wrong; I just really need to see if I’m being unreasonable here.

I (23M) met my gf (20F) at university.  I dropped out due to a job offer and planned to stay there in the town that the university was in around 2 years ago, as the offer is for a job that won’t start for a few years yet (this is normal in my field).  My gf failed last year at uni, due to stress and family matters & over the summer decided that she wanted to be closer to her family.  

We agreed to move to my home town, as it’s only around a 90 minute commute from where her family lives, along with it having a great job opportunity for me in the short term & a university that she could transfer to a 40-minute commute away.  We found an apartment, not a great one admittedly, which demanded an upfront charge that was quite a bit more than we (being uni students) could afford.  Her mother agreed to lend her the money that we needed to cover the difference between what we had and what we needed, saying that she needed to be paid back relatively soon; we agreed.

We signed for the house as co-tenants and agreed between us to share finances in relation to the flat (a shared account for rent, bills, council tax, etc). 

After around 6 weeks in the new place, my gf decides that she doesn’t want to commute to the uni that she was going to move to student accommodation instead, I didnt like the idea, as it would cost us a lot, but agreed, as we could afford it with my job and it would mean no commute for her every day.

I’m just going to throw up simple numbers to keep it simple: her mother lent us £2,500; the overall cost of the tenancy is in excess of £10,000.  My girlfriend agreed to pay off her mother and that I would pay the rent alone, as I’d now be living alone; again, I agreed as it wasn’t a huge deal to me.

Here’s where the issue comes in: she now wants me to pay her back the £2,500 that she gave to her mother.  She argues that she didn’t like the place we got, she didn’t like the commute and she needs the money more because I earn more.  I was honestly offended that she would go so far as to ask me to not only cover the rest of the tenancy alone, but now to also pay her back for what she already paid into it.  I refused point blank and it’s now become a huge mess with many arguments.

We had a huge fight regarding this topic today and she called me an idiot and asshole for giving advice where I shouldn’t. Am I really the asshole ? Should I just listen to her when she tells me about the dates and shut up? Help I am really open for opinions no matter who is right. ,0.0,1.013311743736267,1,0
33,1f15l6l,WIBTAH for calling out a guy with cancer and putting him in his place? ,"My FIL makes me extremely uncomfortable, from the 2nd time I met him he'll stand next to me, put his arm around my waist, pull me into him, he pokes my side when he walks passed me, would poke my belly when I was pregnant. I'm extremely uncomfortable with this and I try to move but I feel very awkward. I literally don't want any man but my husband to touch me, ever. 

A couple month ago while taking my baby from my arms his hand slowly brushed across my chest, I was so shocked, we were at a big family reunion, I'd had a few drinks so I felt like I couldn't say anything. I knew he'd just brush it off as an accident.  

He doesn't listen when it comes to my daughter, I'll say only kiss the top of her head, he keeps going for the face. I asked for only grandparents to visit the hospital, he brought his grandson (18). He just does what ever he wants, regardless what we say. 

My plan was to avoid him as much as possible and it's been working for the most part  but now he's been diagnosed with cancer and of course everyone wants to spend more time together now. I dread seeing him, Yesterday he shows up to our house univited, my whole body tensed up and I wanted to cry.  

My new plan is to pull him aside and tell him that he makes me extremely uncomfortable, I do not like him, list the reasons why.  Makes it very clear I do not believe the hand grazing my chest was an accident and tell him that if we are to coexist peacefully in this family he is no longer allowed to take my daughter from my arms, ill no longer be kissing/hugging him to say hello or goodbye.. and some other boundaries. If he doesn't comply, he won't get to see his granddaughter. 

Side note: this is very triggering for me, being forced to be around a man who makes me so uncomfortable. It's bringing up a lot of trauma. I just want to find a way to not come between a family going through a difficult time, support my husband, whilekeeping myself safe emotionally, mentally and physically. 

Before anyone asks about my husband, he's in a very awkward position where he wants to protect me but can't do anything about me just feeling uncomfortable and I've never told him about the chest grazing incident. 

So would I be the asshole for calling out a guy with cancer, putting him in his place and threatening to go no contact with my daughter if he breaks a boundary or does anything inappropriate to me again?

Normally that wouldn’t bother me but she is also a negative and close minded person. I like to think that I’m an open person. I’m not against opposing ideas, just the unwillingness to let others have their own opinions. So, even prior to my sister having a baby, we didn’t spend much time together but we would talk every now and then. 

Well, my  sister had her baby almost a year ago now, the first baby in our family. We both live in the same State, about 40 minutes from each other. I can count on one hand how many times my sister has invited me to spend time with my nephew or even to hold him, 2 times. This is only when my brother is in town on leave. When we were growing up, we had really close relationships with our extended family because my parents made it possible for us to be around them and visit with them often.

I started thinking recently about the situation and how I have a closer relationship to my friends new baby than to my own nephew. I feel guilt for not being being around or really putting in any effort to see him. In my opinion, it would be his parents responsibility to invite anyone into his life that they want in it and I haven’t been invited.

I am in a new (3yr) relationship with a nice man who has a teenage daughter. I am living with them now and I have a great relationship with both. My daughter doesn’t want to invite my partner’s daughter to the wedding but I asked her to reconsider because they are now part of our extended family. She agreed.

She told me that she will be distancing herself from me after the wedding because I’m not respecting her boundaries. I was so hurt by that and I feel used. At the same time I am her mother and I feel like I should always lead with love even after she has been mean to me.  

Am I wrong for having her invite my partner & his daughter to her wedding that I’m contributing thousands of dollars to?

38,1f14dmy,AITA for confronting my friend for telling my mom about something I told her as a trusted friend? ,"I (34F) have this female friend group who are all married, we’ve been friends for more than 10 years and I was the last one to get married. 

So when we met for a girl’s night out last June, we told stories about married life, etc. Since I trusted them, I vented about financial problems at home. I wasn’t asking for money or help or anything. We were okay. I just needed to talk to someone so I could get it off my chest, TRUSTING that my story would only stay within our friend group. 

Today, one of my friends from the said group , let’s call her Frenny (34F), met my mother at a certain event. And for some reason, Frenny decided it was a good idea to tell my mom about our financial situation, which again I shared with her thinking she was going to keep it to herself. 

I found out because my mother went over to my house to give me a lecture about telling others about my private life, how I should be careful about who I tell me problems to because they might think and say negative things about me and my husband and blah blah blah. My mother has always been very concerned about the public image of our family. She then proceeded to give me money because she thought we were in financial crisis. I think she was more angry because instead of telling her, I told my problems to my friends. However, as I said, I wasn’t asking for help. I was just venting (apparently to the wrong people).

I managed to keep my poker face, apologized to my mom and brushed it off saying it was just a fun conversation between friends. But inside, I felt angry, hurt, and betrayed. 

I confronted Frenny through chat, asking why she would tell my mother about something I told her and our other friends in CONFIDENCE. I told her that if she was going to tell my mother everything we talk about, then thank you the friendship but I don’t need it. 

Frenny replied that if I really thought of her as a friend, then I should know that she meant no harm and that she was just concerned about what people will think about me and my family. 

I feel gaslighted. She didn’t even apologize.

She thought I was angry at her because my mom got mad at me. I don’t really care what my mom says to me. The point is, SHE BETRAYED MY TRUST.

I'll call them Cassandra (17F) and Layla (15F). Two years ago, Luku (2M) (their biological younger brother, absolute light of my life, best boy) was born and surrendered, so he was placed with us too.

Since they were adopted as preteens, a major priority for my parents was bonding with them two-on-three. And they go to a lot of bonding things. They’re constantly bouncing between adoption therapy, family therapy (which feels weird because I’m also part of the family? I’m only included once in a while, usually to be told I need to be less of a show off), and every single bonding thing they can find. They also take them out after individual therapy, which I 100% support and would never admit to being jealous of IRL but… \*god\* I’m jealous of it.

I know it’s not the same, but I had six bouts over the summer and it was a miracle that they attended two. Which did not include the last fight or the Family Day. At least come for the catharsis of seeing me get whacked with a sword!

Sometimes circumstances demand that I’m there - and I moved my schedule to make this happen more often. At first they let me hang to the side, but then they asked that I step back so I’m not engaging with whatever it is they’re doing with my sisters because the bonding activities are supposed to be for them.

I tried to tell them I won the season-long bracket, and they emphasized how much it was not a time to be bragging or doing anything except apologizing. They said my siblings are traumatized and in need of more support. They also accused me of believing my siblings aren’t ‘real’ just because I wanted to have some time with my parents where it wasn’t about my siblings.

After dinner, Layla said she thought it was a good idea, and suggested we go out as a family but paying attention to me in particular for the whole week. That sounds incredibly embarrassing but amazing - I’d adore that, especially since I want to hang out with my sisters more anyway.

Not to mention he would make blatantly fake problems such as missing items, that were suspiciously all in his room, having me search all over the apartment for it. Worst of all, he would come home drunk, sometimes with friends on a weekday, get extra noisy and sometimes break things. He even shoved me in his drunken stupor then when I shoved him off of me then went into his room. The next morning he apologized and tried to beg forgiveness but that was the last straw. 

I always asked him to give me utilities since they were all under his name. I refused to pay if he didn't give me the utilities so I knew for sure what they were, up until things started to get turned off like WiFi and water. 

I  refused to give him this months payment and the last one until I saw all the bills of the last 4 months. He went silent and then I looked at the statements he gave me, saw his account number, and logged in to the portal with his acct # and DOB.

I looked carefully at the PDF statements I had and they looked nothing AT ALL like the ones online. I see that they were forgeries. I am new to this city and had no idea what the utility portals looked like online. I demanded he give me back my money or I take him to small claims court. He gave me back $180 but not the last $120. 

He later tried calling and texting me saying I took his ramen bowl, some spoons that were his (it's hard to tell the difference between mine and his, I should have put my initials in it), and a brass pot that I am 99% certain is mine. All in all I'd say this stuff is worth $30.

He gave me back $180 but not the last $120. 

He later tried calling and texting me saying I took his ramen bowl, some spoons that were his (it's hard to tell the difference between mine and his, I should have put my initials in it), and a brass pot that I am 99% certain is mine. All in all I'd say this stuff is worth $30. 

I am thinking of just not paying him anything else in utilities, leaving him with a total of $150 to pay on his own plus his share, and keep his stuff as restitution (though I'm still 99% certain the pot is mine.""

While I absolutely understand that this is a tragic situation, she constantly brings it up, especially whenever I talk about grief or the loss of my dog.

46,1f12y39,AITA for keeping my half brother from visiting our father's grave/vault,"My (40F) father (76) passed away over two years ago. I suspected he had a second family so was emotionally prepared when a woman (\~50yo) arrived at the wake with her children “Art” (then 23M) and “Kate” (11F). She was a former secretary at my dad’s work and her two children were my half siblings. When  security  tried to make them leave, the woman demanded that they had the right to be there, especially Art, who she called the “*unico hijo*” and “the most important person” there. 



My mother (70) and her sister (F72) were shocked, and those words hit my mom really hard



Unlike his mother, Art was thoughtful.  He understood when I said I needed to prioritize my mom's physical and mental health, and he got his family to leave, which I appreciated. The next day, I took my mom away for a few hours so they could go to the wake.  Mom knew what was going on, of course, and was plenty mad at me. I was stressing about another confrontation at the funeral, so was relieved when Art texted that “out of respect for (my) mother” they would keep away. He asked to visit the columbarium later and I said of course, whenever he wanted



Fast forward 2 years. Art and I both work abroad. We communicated during the distribution of my dad’s estate (money/shares, no property since our house/land are all mom’s family). We were efficient and civil, and  we haven’t talked in over a year. No acrimony, just no longer any need



So I was surprised to get an angry message from Art a few days ago. He was back home, went to the columbary vault, and learned that my mom moved my father’s urn. I called mom and learned that she and her sister had a chapel built on their private land way outside the city. There is a vault with my dad’s urn, and mom said it would eventually house her urn too. I asked if there was any way Art could visit the chapel and she exploded. She is still angry about the *unico hijo* comment and  accusations Art’s mom made during the distribution of dad’s assets.  My mom said Art’s family got too entitled because of me. And that if I kept insisting, I was going to give her a heart attack. My aunt added it was time for me to think of my mom first 



I told Art that I would no longer press my mother about this and for the first time, he blew up at me too. We screamed awful things at each other during the phone call. Now that I’ve calmed down, I can see his side. But if I weigh this against causing my mom any more pain, I’ll choose my mom every time. Art said that after everything he did to be considerate, how could I not even let him visit his father’s resting place. He said  that I’m finally showing my true self, and I’m just like my mom.

47,1f12rp9,AITA for telling my friend I'm not okay with his security cameras?,"So I'm staying with a friend for a while (troubles in paradise) and it has been pretty good so far. The issue is the cameras he has all over the house.

There's one on the front porch, 3 in the common areas (living room, kitchen and on the desk in the dining area) and one in each bedroom (one of which I sleep in).

I don't think there's any nefarious reason for the cameras (there's a huge window in the room I am in, for instance), he has had some issues with people in the past so I get it. but yesterday he went out for a while and I was here alone, and I noticed pretty quickly that the cameras were all on and being triggered by my moving around the house.

I have tried to drop hints here and there about not being comfortable with the cameras being on without my knowledge, but last night I got pretty irritated. I turned one of the cameras around and sent a text telling him *yo, I'm not okay with all these cameras on.*

He replied, *Oh shit. Sorry, I forgot to turn them off again. Ok. Your bedroom was not on. Turned off all except porch and Desk. Cool?*

I didn't say anything more about it, since he was at a friend's and I didn't want to stir up an argument for him while he was out so I just dropped it and dozed off watching TV.

When he got home he woke me up and pretty quickly asked, *so what was up with the cameras?* — so I was pretty straightforward and said I wasn't comfortable being on camera at any time, and I felt it was an invasion of privacy. I didn't see any reason for them to be on if I was here, and I asked why any of the cameras needed to be on at all - referencing him leaving the desk camera on.

He insisted that he wanted the desk camera on for his bedroom door (the camera was facing more toward the living room than the door but this is just nitpicking I guess). I suggested he have a camera IN his room (which he said he did) but that if it was just me at home, who is a trusted friend and is uncomfortable with them, they be off - I noted that I understand it is his house and if the cameras are going to be on that's fine, it wasn't my place to tell him what to do — but for me personally I didn't like being on camera for any reason and don't feel like I should have a specific reason for that. it came across that he thought there must be a reason I *didn't* want to be on camera at which point I indicated that I felt I was trusted in the home and it shouldn't be an issue.

It pretty quickly devolved into a back and forth in which my position was being questioned, *so you don't think I trust you?* and then *so I have to prove I trust you by turning them off?* and at this point I got fed up with the conversation and said *just drop it. it is what it is, I've stated my position - but ultimately it's your choice*.

And I'm assuming give him part of the money I made from doing the tattoo. Because he feels he got back doored out of the money from the bb. Even tho. He was with us when we discussed it. And I don't see how it's my problem that our buddy backed out. I don't feel like I should be financially responsible for paying him out of what I worked for.

50,1f12i98,AITA for walking out during a comedy act?,"Last night hubby and I went to the comedy show at a casino, they host different comedians every weekend. It's always been a blast on the rare occasion we go, except for last night's show.


The host was great, usually the host is the least talented, opener is okay, and headliner is superb. This was the first time I really enjoyed the host, unfortunately they don't get much mic time. The opener was terrible. He was all over the place with basically dad jokes. It felt like he did a Google search right before he went on stage and just recited the jokes to us. I grinned and bared it waiting for the headliner but this opener took forever.


By the time the headliner starts I'm more than a few drinks in. I'm a happy drunk, it wouldn't take much to get me to laugh. He was just slightly better than the opener that had the entire crowd bored to tears. I gave him 20 minutes and was just not enjoying it. I felt like I was in a work meeting just waiting for it to be over. His material was wal-mart and covid. It was just tired. There were a few laughs thru the crowd every now and then, I kept looking at my husband to see if he was enjoying it and it was obvious he wasn't. I was ready to go, I asked hubby to leave and he didn't want to be rude. There was a small bar next door with a dude playing piano and singing, and a nice outdoor seating area with a fire pit. Both sounded like way better options to me but I didn't want to just ditch him.


The comedian cemented for me that it was time to go by berating someone in the crowd for texting on her phone during his act. I absolutely hate that, she wasn't bothering anyone, if he was good enough to keep our attention maybe she wouldn't have been texting. He could have made a joke about it I guess but it was just annoying to me that he's trying to demand her attention instead of earning it.

I whispered to my husband that I was done, he could stay, I was going to go outside for a smoke. I went out and saw a few familiar faces of others that were at the show and peaced out. Hubby is so nonconfrontational its not even funny so he didn't make a big deal out of it, but I could tell was a little annoyed I'd left. I don't think or care honestly if I was an ass to the comedian. I paid my money, as far as I'm concered that's all I owe. It wasn't just that he wasn't entertaining but I really just didn't like him and want to sit politely anymore after he berated that woman like that.

I got such a good deal because a friend of my aunt had to go into assisted living. She wanted to sell it ASAP, I was able to pay in cash, and she gave me a good deal because she knew I was looking and that I'd take great care of it. I'm also in a ""shady"" (according to tech bros who never leave the north side) area. Also, somebody mentioned that I shouldn't look down on my hometown. I will and I'm not sorry for it. I faced a lot of discrimination, and I had to leave because a group of people made it their mission to harass me because they didn't like the way I was born.

Edit: Thank you everybody for your replies. Maybe half an hour after posting this, I tripped on some uneven sidewalk and broke my phone. I had to get it replaced (thank goodness for iCloud) and the cashier just gave me really bad anxiety. Just know that I appreciate all the comments even if I can’t respond right now.

My sister (24F) and I (26M) grew up in a small town that I pretty much got chased out of. I ended up a couple hours away in Chicago. I absolutely love it here. There's things open after 7 PM, I can walk and take transit everywhere, and there's actual jobs for disabled people like me.

A few months ago, I bought a house in the middle of my lease. It's an 800 sqft bungalow in a lovely neighborhood that didn't need any work at all. It cost $220,000. For comparison, my sister bought a 20-year-old 2,400 sqft house for $170,000 last year. In our hometown, my house would go for maybe $80,000. She's not in a bad area or anything - it just has nothing to offer young people who haven't lived there for several generations.

My sister came over yesterday to see the house for the first time, which was an event in itself because she's scared of Chicago. She liked the photos and called it a ""good starter home"" (I plan to live here forever), but was pretty disappointed when she actually got to look around. She claimed it was barely bigger than a studio apartment. She asked how much I paid, I told her, and she said, ""Um, I literally paid $50,000 less for something much newer, prettier, and 3 times the size."" I went, ""Okay? Congrats, but I don't care. I'd rather buy somewhere I actually want to live even if it costs more."" She accused me of being condescending, and said that I shouldn't act like I'm too good for our hometown. I told her I wanted to move past this, and offered to walk with her to the KFC a couple blocks away. She said she'd rather go home, and that I should reimburse her for gas since she drove ""all the way out"" (2 hours) to see me, only for her to ""have to leave"" after half an hour because of my ""attitude"". I told her I wouldn't be doing that and that she chose to leave, and she went, ""You've turned into a complete jerk ever since you moved here."" I told her to leave, and she left.

Through the delivery process, everyone was awake and now, everyone was lacking sleep. Especially my gf’s brother who had been awake nearly 72 hours. To no one’s surprise, the second the baby was settled at home, he passed out on the couch with his wife asleep in the bedroom with the baby. My gf put a blanket over him which I thought to be strange. He’s a light sleeper and so he woke up, she pat his head a couple times like she was his mom or something and he went back to sleep. 

Overall, it was weird and now I’m wondering if I should say something or if it’s too assholish to do that.",1.0,1.0617581605911255,1,1

He doesn't have a long list of friends as we were homeschooled for a lot of years, so I reached out to all my closest friends to see if any would come to his party. 

My closest friend of 5 years, someone I grew as a person with, told me early this month he would try to make it, and is now telling me the day of that his girlfriend has... cheer practice, and said quote ""I dont go nowhere without her."" 

I was really counting on him cause I dont have many people myself to reach out to to begin with, and most people said they couldn't make it. Got a bit angry with  him and told him he wouldnt have done this when we were younger. Screenshot of the texts are in my last reddit post if you want to see.

For the last few months, I have been suffering from extreme fatigue, anxiety, and I always seem to be sick, Over the last six years that I have been working this job, my wife has been unemployed she takes care of the house and watches my child 11 years old  (from previous relationship) 3 days every other week.

But I have told her idk how much longer I can keep this up, because it’s starting to feel like it’s killing me. She mostly ignores me when I start talking about it.

No more than 10 hour work days except on occasion, and a schedule that allows me to have a maintainable healthy workout schedule, and ample time to spend with my child while in our care. This made her very mad because that would mean she would have to work part time as well to help pay bills to which she believes she shouldn’t have to do.

61,1f10dlw,AITA for telling my best friend she should call off her wedding?,"Throwaway, names are fake.

I (27F) have a best friend, Daisy (27F), who is getting married in about a month and a half to Max (29M). They’ve been together for 3 years and are really perfect together. I was super supportive of their wedding until recently.

About a week ago, Daisy had her bachelorette party. She didn’t wanna do anything crazy, so just the closest girlfriends went to a small vineyard for a nice dinner, and it was during this dinner that she dropped the bomb. She made a big show of pouring everyone a glass of the house red except for herself, and took a huge sip of her water. She was smiling at all of us as if we were already in on the joke, but we weren’t. But then, slowly, realization dawned and she confirmed: she was pregnant. 2 months pregnant, to be exact. We were all happy for her, congratulating her, hugging, etc. Then someone made one of those jokes about them having to get married just cause she’s pregnant and she got all mischievous again. She then revealed that Max doesn’t know and that it was going to be a surprise. The reaction to this was mostly positive which dumbfounded me.

Max and Daisy have always wanted kids. I even know they explicitly talked about it before deciding to get married, which is definitely the right thing to do. However, just because two people want kids, doesn’t mean one person can just make the decision of when is the right time, and that’s exactly what I feel like Daisy is doing. I don’t think you should marry someone when you’re keeping something that massive secret. I have no idea how she managed to keep it secret for 2 month anyways, but according to her they’ve been so busy with the wedding planning it was easy to hide, and anything weird happening, like her vomiting, she just attributed to stress. 

I talked to Daisy the day after the party. I told her what I thought, and that I was just trying to look out for her and that if it was the other way around I would want her to do the same for me. She got really quiet while I was talking and afterwards told me that she didn’t appreciate me ‘butting in’ on their marriage and that it was her decision. I pointed out that it shouldn’t be just ‘her decision’ that she was majorly affecting Max's life too without even including him in the conversation and that she shouldn't go through with the wedding if she was insistent on keeping him in the dark. This pissed her off and she told me to leave and not contact her. Since then I’ve gotten some messages from our friends who were at the party, so I guess she told them. A couple of them agree with me, but most of them are on her side and are calling me an asshole for ‘ruining what’s supposed to be the most exciting time’ in Daisy’s life, and 'what gives me the right', etc. I don’t regret speaking up, but I'm worried that I might’ve ruined our friendship and am not even sure I’ll still be allowed to come to the wedding.

62,1f10dg3,"AITA for telling me girlfriend she doesn’t actually want to take care of me, she just wants to say it to feel better about herself","My fiancé (f19) and I (m21) have lived together for about a year. I currently work doing uber and I do all the driving. She hasn’t had a full time job in over a year because she hasn’t heard back on any applications she’s put out. She also doesn’t drive because it scares her. 

She was learning to drive for awhile and then hit a parked car in a parking lot and I got really mad at her. She was absolutely terrified of driving before this but tried her best to learn, and after it happened she has refused to drive again. 

Yesterday she was talking about how she feels bad that I have to carry all the weight, with working and driving, and that she isn’t happy with the way things are because she feels like I am constantly taking care of her and she isn’t doing the same for me. This was mentioned because she is waiting to hear back from a course to become a CNA. She was saying she hopes she gets into the course because then she will be able to get me gifts and help with car payments and everything like that, basically saying she hopes it works out so I don’t have to worry so much. She also said that if she gets into this course, she can eventually save money to go back to driving lessons and work through her anxiety. 

I told her that while that sounds nice, it seems like she is just virtue signalling. Like she’s saying it to make herself feel better, but she isn’t prepared to commit to actually doing it. She’s had opportunities like this in the past and has ruined them by not being a good employee.

She told me the jobs in the past were hard because she has bipolar and it made it really hard for her to commit to working, but that now she’s on medication for it and hopes she can change her habits. She seemed really upset and then went to the bathroom. I tried to talk to her and she was just crying and told me leave her alone. She slept on the couch and hasn’t talked to me at all today.

About a year ago, I (25F) moved into a second floor flat. It's a 5-story building, there's four flats on each floor and the floor plan for each is identical. This post is about my neighbor (30s?F), who lives directly below me.



About six months ago, I got a knock on the door. It was my downstairs neighbor who told me that she can hear loud noises from my apartment every day, and asked me be more quiet. I was confused, since I'm a pretty quiet person (no loud speakers, no pets, etc.), so I asked her what she meant. She told me that she can hear ""stomping"". Again, weird, but okay. I told her I'd try to be more quiet, and gave her my number so she could get in touch if the problem persisted.



And oh boy, did it ever. Turns out she can hear every step I take in my apartment. Even when I'm doing my best to sneak. No other noise carries, it's just... structural noise? She can hear me walk around, if I move a chair, if I vacuum, and apparently, she can hear the water in the pipes every time I take a shower or use the toilet. This sucks for her, and I get that, so I did my best to reduce the noise. I got those little felt pads for all of my furniture. I bought new carpets, the plush kind. I started to wear woolly socks and/or slippers when at home - we live in a shoes-off-indoors country, and I figured this would be better than just socks/barefoot. I've restricted my showers so I don't use it after she goes to bed (9 PM) or early in the morning.



Not good enough, she can still hear me. It's not just my water use that she can hear either, since I've gotten messages at 5 am of ""Please stop showering this early"" despite being, you know, ASLEEP. She seems to blame me for her loss of sleep, since she can hear me walk around at night. I get the annoyance, but it's not like I can just not go to the bathroom at 3 am just to preserve her peace of mind. I've done what I can, and I think this is the part where she has to start meeting me halfway. Maybe by investing in a good pair of headphones, or a white noise machine.



I'm not going to lie, this is making me feel anxious and like I'm constantly being supervised. I feel like I can't do anything in my own home without getting an instant text telling me off. It got to the point where I'd get home and sit on my couch, vibrating with anxiety. I'm tired of this. I just want to live. So, I've been trying to get back to existing normally again, which infuriates her, because the noise is getting worse.



So, reddit... am I the asshole upstairs neighbor?

68,1f0zdfh,AITA for trying to help my brother?,"I'd like to talk about my background first. I (M, I'd like to keep my age private) had a mother who passed away when I was very young. My father remarried shortly after then with another woman. I ran away, convinced that he had betrayed my mother. I would then be taken in by a relative, and moved overseas with him.

Over a year ago, my father somehow managed to get my phone number. He would then spam messages and calls to me, and of course, I blocked his number. Nonetheless, he was able to contact me through my relative. He told me that his second wife had died in an accident, and he went bankrupt. He begged for me to help my half-brother, whom he had sent to an orphanage. Initially, I was going to refuse, but my curiosity took over, and I ended up contacting my half-brother.

K (16M) was a very innocent child. When I first called him, he didn't suspect a thing when I told him I was his older half-brother. He would act very clingy and affectionate towards me. I can't say that I hated it. I was very grateful to K for giving me the love I had always lack.

I wasn't good at showing affection, so I was cold to K most of the time. The only way I could show K that I cared about him was by helping him become the top student in his school. K studied at a high school that was very competitive. The school gave top students privileges. In order to do this, I planned out a strict schedule for K to follow. I expected him to follow every instructions of mine, and to report to me daily about his progress. K was gifted, and he would always tell me how perfect he did at school. For quite a long time, I believed him. I trusted him enough to not actually check his progress at school, and only relying on his words as proof. However, I realized that there were some discrepancies in K's reports. I decided to book a flight returning to my homeland, where I would personally go check on K.

I arrived just in time to witness K being ganged up by a group of bullies. When I managed to save K, he was heavily injured, and would be in a coma after then.

I found out from his classmate that he wasn't doing perfect on his tests like what he told me, and the bullies had been after him for quite some time now. I will admit, I was very mad when I found out he lied to me.

However, I realized I was too controlling over K. I expected him to do what I wanted him to do, not what he wanted to do. To be honest, I projected my younger self onto him. We both lost our mothers, and I couldn't help but see myself in him, and I didn't want him to lose control of his life like I did. I also realized that K lied to me because he didn't want to be scolded by me. He didn't want me to be disappointed, not when I had tried to help him out.

But this is all just speculation. In reality, I don't know what K thinks of me yet, because I can't ask him now, not when he is still comatose.

69,1f0z2de,AITA for asking my bff not to keep me a secret from her family ,"I recently took my best friend on an amazing trip to Sardinia, I covered all expenses. She only had to pay for her flight. One day she grabbed my phone and said she needed to block her sisters from my TikTok account because they could see the content I was posting about our trip. I didn’t understand why this was necessary,it left me feeling weird.
Later I asked about it. Her response: after I got married, my family told me to cut you out of my life because they believe you’re a bad influence. I asked: why do they have such a bad impression of me? Her response: my sisters met you when you were 21 and you were a bit wild back then, you used to smoke/ do drugs so they have a wild image of you. I’m 27 now and grown out of those days. 
She reassures me I shouldn’t take things to heart because her family are looking out for her, and that she hasn’t cut me out because she believes I’m a good person, and her husband approves of me so it’s all good
Upon returning from Sardinia I sent her this message: Hey, since our trip to Sardinia, I’ve been feeling very uncomfortable about your decision to keep me a secret from your loved ones. 
I understand your family have a misconception of me, but you and I know that it’s wrong of them to judge me for some unwise decisions I made when I was young and foolish. 
As I am starting to have a higher self-regard as each day passes, I truly believe that having me as a friend/partner is a privilege and a blessing in anyone’s life. 
If you truly believe that I am a good person, as you say, then I would like you to defend me and this friendship instead of choosing to conceal me, as that just means that you are ashamed of having me in your life.
I respect you and value this friendship, I also feel like I go above and beyond for this relationship, so it’s very insulting to me that I have to be concealed in your life while you reap the benefits of this relationship. 
Please don’t respond to this message straight away, I would like you to introspect over this matter and then let me know your thoughts.
She ‘hearted❤️’ the message but didn’t reply.
Today it’s her birthday I sent a birthday message and asked to check her mail for a present. 
She replied: Thank you, surprised you remembered lol
My reply: I never forget
Her reply: Okay well I’m surprised you said anything
My reply:why? 
Her reply: After your long message thought disliked me
My reply: I just told you how I feel about your decision to keep me a secret from your family
I’m waiting on your thoughts. 
Her reply: My thoughts are I didn’t see our relationship as transactional and I thought if I give you the space maybe you’ll understand my importance/place in your life if you truly feel that you go “above and beyond”.

Am I the arsehole for asking her not to hide me from her family?

70,1f0yovg,AITA for asking my friend for gas money?,"Ok so for some context I’m 25F and my friend “Dave” is 38M & totally platonic situation so don’t be weird in the comments please.

A couple months ago Dave and I got into an argument about a couple things one of them being I feel taken advantage of because I’m being expected to give rides all the time but he says I smoke all his weed. I definitely disagree with him saying that because whenever I do give him rides he’ll smoke me a bowl or offer me a dab & outside of that I only really smoke their reclaim so I’m not taking all their stuff. Well after that Argument I didn’t talk to Dave for a couple months until my bf decided our friendship was too important and brought Dave to the house & said we had to talk it out and be friends again.

I won’t lie I’m definitely still very frustrated because even when we did talk it out he kept doubling down on everything he said before I had to just cut him off and say I’m not here to fight more and told him to stop trying to pick a fight with me. 

So now here’s where the gas became a problem last night. We had an event that I had been planning on going to alone when it was scheduled in the time me and Dave were not talking and as soon as we started talking again he starts saying things like “so we’re going to that event right?” And I know that means he’s expecting me to pick him up. I live 5 mins from our downtown area and he lives, not fully across town, but far enough that I have to go a ways out of my way to pick him up. I did have a family event to go to with my bf before the other event that Dave wanted to go to so I told Dave he needed to Uber there and then we could talk about the ride situation. When I got to the event I talked to Dave and said everything about how he needs to give me gas money & weed doesn’t count anymore because he just throws it in my face when he’s mad so I told him he either needed to give me gas money or call another Uber home and he said he’d give me gas money. 

It’s the next morning he never gave me gas money, he gave me one dab when I dropped him off, and when I texted him asking for gas money and even spelled out how much extra gas I use to include him in things he hasn’t replied so I’m thinking I’m not getting any. 

Side note: I did look up the miles to see how much extra I use and from my place to the event is 3 miles but I added an extra 20 miles just one way.

For some context, my parents are divorced and I live with my mum, he visits once a week. I had dropped out of uni and have been applying to various jobs and courses.   
  
The plan was to have dinner out with his sister, and for all of us to catch up. On the car ride there and back, he asked me what I was doing. I mentioned that I had recently done two things, managed to get an interview for a social marketing part-time job, but it didn't go through, and that my application for a course had been approved. He spent both car rides to the resturant and back berating, questioning and disapproving of everything (""The job you applied for is a scam, they just want cheap labour"" ""Why are you applying for a part-time job, you should be applying for full-time jobs"", etc). It got worse when he realised that I had only gotten the application approved, and not actually gotten into the course itself. During the dinner, he didn't make any of those remarks, cause the last time he did it infront of his siblings, he got called out on it.

I know I fucked up by yelling back at him but it was the straw that broke the back after a 1000 cuts. I tried explaining to him that I appreciate his advice and all that he's done for me, I just didn't like the way he's been saying it my entire life, but he took it as me not respecting him at all.

When I get home I always greet and hug and kiss her when I get home and we talk about our days. After that I’ll go play my game for about 2-3 hours. Then we’ll eat dinner and I’ll watch a movie or a show or something with her. So we end up going to bed around 12am-1am after we watch a couple episodes and a movie or something. 

Last night the issue came to an eruption. She had a friend over from about 6pm-9pm so I played my game while she was over and towards the end around 9pm I got on with a friend to play 1 round of a game that last about 30-45 minutes. She got upset with me because after I got done we ate and watched something like we always do but I had to call it in a little earlier because I had a long day at work. This was like at 11:30

She starts to lose it saying that I never spend time with her anymore or show her attention. I was completely baffled by this because i do spend time with her after work and on my days off we always do whatever she wants to do.

I know this is not true as he doesn’t think this way, it’s just difficult to be the different one. Besides culture I am also 5-10 years younger than my husband, BIL and wife. Sometimes they joke about my age, asking if I would also “like a colouring book to paint” like my nephew. Even though they have a general international mindset, it’s not nearly as international as it first seemed. When it’s the 4 of us they are respectful enough to only speak English, and are mostly nice to me to be honest, however I always feel they wish I was one of them, their age and culture. My BIL has also been married for much longer than my husband and I, and the 3 of them have spent a lot of time together, so I always feel like the newbie. 

Some past gatherings have been awful for me, as it was at my BIL and wife’s house, and all her foreign family. I happily attended however being 1 outsider out of 20 was awful. They spoke their own language at the big table and I felt very outside of my comfort zone. I have studied in a place with 90+ nationalities so I am fairly culturally aware, however a space where everyone comes from the same place except me was very uncomfortable. 

Recently my husband has suggested we invite my BIL, wife, and the wife’s family for dinner at our place. It confuses me since this is essentially placing the BIL’s wife at the core of the social event, only holding it in my house? I’m not sure if he’s realised we are married and our own family now and he doesn’t need to cling on to his brother’s inlaws (sorry, venting). I’m concerned it would be a disaster not to understand the conversations in my own house, however I’m even more worried why my husband would make such a suggestion. 

AITA for not wanting to host my BIL’s wife’s family (so many degrees of separation btw)? This includes her brothers and brothers wives. It really feels like being an extension of her family in my own house. ",TL;DR,2024-08-25,"AITA for not wanting to host my SIL’s family? AITA for not wanting to host my SIL’s family?

74,1f0xq83,AITA for not sending my kids back to the US to finish their school?,"I (54F) and my kids (17M and 16M) came on vacation to Chad (a country in Africa) a year ago, telling them that we will be on vacation, but before school started I made the decision to stay there because I wanted a better life for myself because I was miserable in the US, but I didn't tell them this. What I did tell them is that they will be staying here, and that is a week before school started. Since then, we have been getting into constant fights about the school they have been going to, which they don't like because it didn't offer the same opportunities as they school they went to back in the US, but I think it is better for them because it offers the ability to graduate early, but they don't want to graduate early either.

Two weeks ago I got into a fight with the kids when both of them asked me to go back to the United States for their extracurriculars and advanced classes and I told them to ask their dad. They told me that he is not the one who decides; I am. After a few minutes of back and forth, I called a relative to pick them up.

But what happened today is what really stressed me out, as this argument was worse than the one a few weeks ago. For a few weeks now, I have been doing their renewal of their expired passports so I can send them back to do their school in the US. Today, their passports came back to me, and my kids asked me if they can go back now. I told them that I have changed my mind and that they will not be going back to the US to finish up their school because I have a job here and my life and that I have asked my cousin to go and she said she wasn't able to. Both of my kids exploded on me, telling me I have every reason to drop everything and go back to the US with them, and that their education, happiness, and opportunities are more important than my happiness. I told them that while they may be upset now, they will thank me later when they realized that they have a big family here, lots of cousins and they can build better relationships here. They told me that I don't care about them at all and that the only thing I cared about is filling up my ""delusional"" dream of a perfect child because I am so obsessed with the idea of them finishing high school here early when they don't want to, and that both of my kids had their important years at school (youngest is a junior while eldest is a senior) and that I am going to succeed in ruining those years for them because I only cared about myself and my needs. They then called me an asshole for not sending them back and lying to them about sending them back and they stormed off into their room. This time I didn't call a relative for this.

I really did enjoy being a part of my group, until I was asked to be on television. I started making so many appearances on a variety of shows that the agency that owned my group started making me appear less and less group events. I missed out on many different performances and my own friends started thinking of me more as a person that appeared on tv instead of a member of my own group. Eventually, I switched to a different group, which told me what I wanted to hear, but quickly broke all their promises, thus leading to me retiring from being in any more music groups. 

S is still in her music group, and at the time I was attempting to get her to leave it. S is under a lot of pressure from being in her group and it isn’t very good for her mental health. When I first met her, she was extremely afraid, saying the only reason why she is in the group is because of her pretty face, and not her actual talent for singing and dancing. The other members of her group frequently mistreat her for that fact and it makes her extremely insecure. She is pressured to put on a mature, and confident persona, while in reality she is anything but that.

One day we were in our school’s courtyard. S attempted to encourage me to get back into the music group business, as at the time we were helping another girl who was a year younger than us get into the music group business as she has had big dreams of it since she was little. I explained why I left and why I wouldn’t come back, reminding her of how I just wanted somebody known for being a part of her music group, and not somebody known for being on tv and how I only really excelled on tv, and not in a music group. She attempted to comfort me by telling me I was a wonderful member of my music group. I snapped.

While we were on this trip, my other sister 25F had her trust betrayed by her boyfriend because he went to a club (something which they have previously agreed neither of them will ever go to). My sister was angry and rightfully so but when her boyfriend was confronted with this, he claimed that it was the fault of all the groomsmen (me and my brother 31M excluded) because apparently they pressured him to go to the club and they made him have a lot and apparently they also made him pay for the Uber. We agree that this reasoning is ridiculous though, especially the last one as everyone on the trip had an understanding to use this app that allows us to split the bills for drinks, food, rides and so on.

78,1f0x79l,AITA for telling my mom I won’t tell her if anything happens to me?,"34M. Parents tend to be annoyingly persistent when they think they know what's best for me. I know it comes from a good place but it’s difficult to have conversations with them because if I express a desire to buy/do anything they don't simply listen or give an opinion; they actively push what they want onto me.

For example: I tell dad I'm looking into getting a new car and considered Car A. He'll ask why don't I look into Car B. I explicitly tell him why (e.g. expensive and doesn't suit my lifestyle) but for the next few months he'll ask at least once a week if I've decided on a new car and to look into B again. My mom (who I know isn't into cars) will randomly ask me to look into B. Suddenly “my mom’s friend from her karaoke group whom I've never met"" is suggesting I look into B. Etc.

Last year I hit a breaking point. I was going on a trip and my parents asked if I wanted a new travel bag. I said my current one’s fine. They got a new bag anyways and kept asking me if I wanted a new bag. Apparently ""this new bag will be much better"", even though they've seen my old bag maybe once. After the 4th or 5th time I told them on WhatsApp to stop asking me if I need a new bag, I've repeatedly said I had a perfectly good bag that's less than a year old, it’s only been used a few times, and if I don't think I need a new bag I don't like being asked about it repeatedly.

The night before the trip they asked again. I looked at it and it was smaller than my current bag so I can't even fit everything I want in it. I went on a long rant about how I dislike how much they try to push what they want onto me. That sometimes what they think is right for me isn't what I think is right for myself. When I tell them explicitly why I pick Car A over Car B and they continue to push B it feels like they aren't listening to me or respecting my decisions. When they tell me that the bag they got ""will be better"" than my current bag that they've barely seen it's like they think I don't know how to buy things for myself. They acknowledged this and then said they would try to do better.

Flash forward to a couple days ago. I told the family chat that I found a huge spider in my car that disappeared when I tried to get rid of it so it might still be in the car. It was meant to be a funny story. My mom sends an article on all-natural spider repellents and asked if I wanted her to make one. I said no. The next day I stopped by my parents’ house and before I left my mom insisted I hang this bag of herbs in my car to repel spiders. I told her I didn't want it. After she asked 3 more times, I took it and said something like ""Next time something happens, I'm just not going to tell you"" in Chinese.

80,1f0ur4x,AITA for not being grateful about my birthday?,"A few days ago, it was my birthday and I’m currently in another country. My parents made it clear to me that budget was tight as we were going to another country and I should consider this, my gift.   

Here is the problem.  

First of all, we got a pack of cheap balloons, and I blew them all up myself because my mum and dad were both tired. I said okay. Then, as a prank, my dad decides to pop all of the 30 balloons I’ve just blown up to ‘lighten up the mood’. 

Understandably, I was a bit mad but then we went out to buy the cake. My aunt is with us and she says the chocolate cake is delicious. My parents know I despise chocolate and it genuinely makes me sick sometimes, but they said that I should stop being so self centred and just not have a slice of cake if it was an issue. I was really fed up at this point, but I just brushed it off. I was firm and said I wanted the strawberry, and as I leave to go, they take the chocolate anyways and say I’ve got bad taste.  

My mom gives me 20 euros as a birthday gift and I was really grateful for it. Then, we go to an uncle’s house and as we leave, my mum and dad get into an argument, as my dad is saying they didn’t bring anything for my uncle and came empty handed. My mum comes up to me and asks for the 20 euros back to give to the uncle and I was really tired at that point from the long ride to get there and I said no. Guess what, she takes it from me under the threat of being grounded.   

So I’ve started to consider this the worst birthday, but I’m really starting to think maybe I’m just being a bit of an asshole since I’m in another country anyways but I really felt hurt when we get home. I’m thinking maybe stuff will get better now, and as we do the gifts, my mum says she bought gifts for my cousins instead and she had already given me a gift in the money from earlier.  

I told her that enough was enough, and that the whole birthday had never been about me and was just an excuse for the adults to give gifts and eat lavishly. She told me I was being ungrateful. A few things I’ll mention below.  

. They went to this really expensive posh store for the cake, but i wanted to go to a much cheaper place. All the adults really love this place and bought a ton of pastries, none of which they allowed me to have.

  . My mom considered the money a gift, as I could have spent it before we got to the uncles house  

. When we cut the cake, I got the smallest slice, and my dad said (in front of everyone), I was gaining so much weight, they were doing me a favour by giving me a small slice.

Edit: I feel really reassured that my parents were in the wrong and I confided in my grandparents over call. When I’m back from holidays, they’d love to have me over for a bit until I feel comfortable with my parents again. My dad did apologise for the weight comment but still says I’m being petty on the balloons whilst my mum is giving me the silent treatment. I was pretty in my feelings and told her how she treated me was not okay and she says she’s done so much for me. It escalated to the point she called me the B word. I’ve been in my room since.

My parents know I despise chocolate and it genuinely makes me sick sometimes, but they said that I should stop being so self centred and just not have a slice of cake if it was an issue. I was really fed up at this point, but I just brushed it off. I was firm and said I wanted the strawberry, and as I leave to go, they take the chocolate anyways and say I’ve got bad taste.  

My mom gives me 20 euros as a birthday gift and I was really grateful for it. Then, we go to an uncle’s house and as we leave, my mum and dad get into an argument, as my dad is saying they didn’t bring anything for my uncle and came empty handed. My mum comes up to me and asks for the 20 euros back to give to the uncle and I was really tired at that point from the long ride to get there and I said no. Guess what, she takes it from me under the threat of being grounded.   

So I’ve started to consider this the worst birthday, but I’m really starting to think maybe I’m just being a bit of an asshole since I’m in another country anyways but I really felt hurt when we get home. I’m thinking maybe stuff will get better now, and as we do the gifts, my mum says she bought gifts for my cousins instead and she had already given me a gift in the money from earlier.  

I told her that enough was enough, and that the whole birthday had never been about me and was just an excuse for the adults to give gifts and eat lavishly. She told me I was being ungrateful. A few things I’ll mention below.  

. They went to this really expensive posh store for the cake, but i wanted to go to a much cheaper place. All the adults really love this place and bought a ton of pastries, none of which they allowed me to have.

  . My mom considered the money a gift, as I could have spent it before we got to the uncles house  

. When we cut the cake, I got the smallest slice, and my dad said (in front of everyone), I was gaining so much weight, they were doing me a favour by giving me a small slice.

Edit: I feel really reassured that my parents were in the wrong and I confided in my grandparents over call. When I’m back from holidays, they’d love to have me over for a bit until I feel comfortable with my parents again. My dad did apologise for the weight comment but still says I’m being petty on the balloons whilst my mum is giving me the silent treatment. I was pretty in my feelings and told her how she treated me was not okay and she says she’s done so much for me. It escalated to the point she called me the B word. I’ve been in my room since.

81,1f0tzrk,"WIBTA for selling a car given to me by my grandma, that I used for 3 months?","I (19F) was planning on getting a car last year for my first year of university. My parents were on board with the idea and we were searching for second-hand car options. During a family dinner in June 2023, my parents mentioned to my grandma (78F) that we were looking for a car. After hearing that, she offered to give her current car (about 12 years old) to me as a gift, since she was planning on buying a new car for herself. She said there was no re-sale value for her current car since it was so old, so she offered it to me. She said she would give her car to me in about 5 months, after she had gotten her new car and I had gotten my licence. 

In November, however, my grandma continuously postponed giving me her car for six months (not a complaint, just for context of the situation. I was already taking the bus and walking for months before we thought of getting a car). In May of this year, I finally received the car, and have been using it for the past 3 months.

In the meantime, my family ordered a new car (to replace one of my parent's cars (which is over 10 years old), not for me)which arrived a few days ago (it was supposed to come in February of next year, but came 6 months early), so we now have 1 extra car. We were going to sell the car my grandma gave me (based on financial calculations) and give her the money, in order to get rid of an extra car. However, this means I was only driving my grandma’s old car for a very short period of 3 months, due to the circumstances of our new car coming early, and my grandma postponing when she passed her car to me. We told her about our decision to sell her car, and she sounded upset and told us not to sell it. She passive-aggressively said she would take back the car and leave it on her lawn. It was likely she felt we were ungrateful and unappreciative of her actions, as she gave us her car and after three months, we were planning to sell it. As of right now, in order to keep her happy, we are considering keeping the car she gave me. This would mean that we would have to get rid of another car, despite the clear financial disadvantages that this would have.

So, WIBTA for selling a car given to me by my grandma, as financially, it doesn’t make sense to keep the car?

82,1f0tpf5,AITA for not checking in on my sister during her first day of high school?,"My sister (15f) and I (16f) don't have a good relationship and we fight like crazy. I never want to hang out with her and she never wants to hang out with me. This started when we were really young and our parents used to force us on each other. Whenever we were home and doing our own thing they would intervene and force us to play together and they would legitimately stand over us and make sure we were doing something together. Putting us in a room was never enough. My mom told us that her favorite thing about having sisters was having three best friends at home and someone to hang out with always. She only had the two of us and really tried to recreate what she had with her sisters through us.

But we were never into the same things and we resented each other being forced together so much. Dad was the same way but he'd also take us to the park and call us back if we played with other kids and not each other. He'd direct us on what we could and couldn't do if we didn't go along with automatically playing together. It led to us fighting, and screaming at each other. When we were younger and we were sharing a bedroom we used to wake each other up and fight. It only made our parents force us together more. Which made us hate each other more.

Our grandparents would babysit us sometimes and they'd get yelled at for separating us and letting us do our own thing. Or for doing 1:1 stuff with each of us. So grandpa would take me and grandma would take my sister and then they'd swap which granddaughter they had. Eventually, for that very reason, my parents stopped letting them babysit us or have grandparent sleepovers. My parents did eventually stop forcing us together so much after mom's sisters all said they would not have been close like they were if it had to be forced and how my parents probably ruined the chance we did have at naturally growing closer. I was 11 when they finally stopped and that was also when we got our own bedrooms.

My sister has struggled at school for a long time and she also has anxiety. She had to repeat a grade and it made her hate school. She started high school last week and she was anxious. My parents were worried about her. So they dropped her off for the first day and picked her up. When she got home from her first day my parents asked her how it was and whether I checked on her during the day, and she asked why the fuck would I do that and why would she want me to do that and how gross it would be for me to talk to her. My parents confronted me and yelled at me for not being a better sister to her. So last week was shitty with them and they're still pissed about it. My mom told me we're family and we act like we don't care about each other. Of course I can't speak for my sister but I don't care about her and I believe that feeling is mutual. I didn't say that to my mom obviously. But the message was still clear that she and dad are disappointed in me for not checking on her that first day.

My older brothers are 7 & 9 years older than me, we share a dad and they have the same mom. Our father passed away when I was 7 and I was already only seeing him 1-2 times per year. They grew up much better off than I did and were teenagers when my father passed. At first, they stayed somewhat in contact but that really fell away unless our grandparents flew in from out of state. I also have a younger half brother that I share a mom with and we are much closer, I don't view him as a ""half-sibling"". My older brothers however, rarely make an effort to talk to me. The one I was closer with stopped talking to me completely when his wife blocked me due to differing opinions during COVID (I was an ICU nurse and unfollowed her because she was saying basically that COVID was fake when I was putting people in body bags) and... I haven't heard anything from them (or my nephews) since. The older brother rarely (if ever) reaches out to me, not even a happy birthday text or message even though their mom does. Whenever he would see me he would just cry - I feel like it may be traumatic to see me for them because I just serve as a reminder of my dad.

I (39F) my fiancé (55M) are getting married in a month. We’ve been in a relationship for 5 years now but mostly on LDR. Into the story.. I’m doing most of the preparation as he is in another country for work and will be there a couple of weeks before the big day. I need to discuss with the caterer about the menu so before meeting with them, we talked about what we want. Now, this is the part where I may be the asshole. He wants to send everyone the menu and let them choose what they want on the day of the event. I told him, there’s no need as in our process, we pick the food from the starters to the desert, the guests will just eat what has been prepared choosing from what already has been prepped. Guests are all my fiends and family members as none from his side will be able to make it, so I know what’s gonna work for them. He kept pushing and discussing and I kept explaining why I don’t want to. It’s an added stress for me to get their orders or request when it’s all gonna be a buffet. I don’t want to add that task on my lap. He funded the wedding, with a little from me here and there so I mostly agree to his requests. That’s what he wants so I would give it to him, I thought. But if I feel like something is too much for me, I would tell him. We discuss stuff but this discussion tonight is taking a toll on me.

87,1f0qwbf,AITA if I refuse to drive a friend home?,"Hey, I (F, 29) have a friend (F, 31) who doesn’t have a driver’s license. Whenever our friend group gets together, I’m usually the one who ends up taking her home because she kept asking me to take her since I ""live closeby anyways"" and our other friends live further away. At first, I didn’t really mind because she's a friend and our group only meet up about once a month anyway, but lately my partner is getting annoyed that I keep saying yes to her because this has been going on for years now and the drive to take her home takes us about 30 to 40 minutes since we have to go past our own house to get to hers, and then drive back again.

Part of what's bothering by partner, apart from the time it takes, is that she waits until the end of the night, usually after midnight, and then asks in front of everyone, never beforehand. Also, if anyone else offers to drive her because they need to go in her direction anyways, she always declines, saying she doesn’t want to bother them and she'd rather wait a few hours for a bus. She doesn’t ask her family either because “they’d say no anyway” (which might be true since she doesn’t have the nicest family). However, she never has a problem with asking me to take her.

One time, I tried to turn her down by mentioning that the drive takes about 30 minutes, but she just brushed it off, saying her dad could make it faster which made me look like the bad guy because she insisted the drive wasn’t that long in front of everyone and resulted in awkward silence from everyone.

Now, I’m in this awkward spot where she asks for a ride while and I get annoyed looks from my partner and my other friends just expect me to agree because she has no other way to get home (buses don’t run that late, and she lives in a remote area). I don’t want to seem like an asshole for saying no, but the talks with my partner have made me question things. 

The whole situation just makes me really uncomfortable because I hate saying no, and I feel like my friends will think I’m being mean if I refuse. It’s gotten to the point where I’m dreading our get-togethers because I know this will come up at the end of the night.

Whenever our friend group gets together, I’m usually the one who ends up taking her home because she kept asking me to take her since I ""live closeby anyways"" and our other friends live further away. At first, I didn’t really mind because she's a friend and our group only meet up about once a month anyway, but lately my partner is getting annoyed that I keep saying yes to her because this has been going on for years now and the drive to take her home takes us about 30 to 40 minutes since we have to go past our own house to get to hers, and then drive back again.

Part of what's bothering by partner, apart from the time it takes, is that she waits until the end of the night, usually after midnight, and then asks in front of everyone, never beforehand. Also, if anyone else offers to drive her because they need to go in her direction anyways, she always declines, saying she doesn’t want to bother them and she'd rather wait a few hours for a bus. She doesn’t ask her family either because “they’d say no anyway” (which might be true since she doesn’t have the nicest family). However, she never has a problem with asking me to take her.

One time, I tried to turn her down by mentioning that the drive takes about 30 minutes, but she just brushed it off, saying her dad could make it faster which made me look like the bad guy because she insisted the drive wasn’t that long in front of everyone and resulted in awkward silence from everyone.

Now, I’m in this awkward spot where she asks for a ride while and I get annoyed looks from my partner and my other friends just expect me to agree because she has no other way to get home (buses don’t run that late, and she lives in a remote area). I don’t want to seem like an asshole for saying no, but the talks with my partner have made me question things. 

The whole situation just makes me really uncomfortable because I hate saying no, and I feel like my friends will think I’m being mean if I refuse. It’s gotten to the point where I’m dreading our get-togethers because I know this will come up at the end of the night.

I first met her when I joined a youth theatre company and we hit it off almost immediately and she became my closest friend yet. Recently, I have gotten a new friend (f14) who we'll call Claire. Claire and I only really became close about a month ago when, let's just say, one of our classmates got what they deserved and Claire and I were impacted by this person greatly in a bad way. A couple months a go, I received a text from Miranda which was basically her confessing her love to me. My stomach dropped. I felt so bad because I didn't feel the same way and I tried to let her down the best way I could. A day later, Miranda texted me again telling me that she thought that she had a crush on me but it wasn't real. A few weeks ago, I started developing feelings for Claire. I got really sad one night and decided to write an instagram note about Claire but not directly addressing her. I then received a text by a mutual between Miranda and I, asking if my note was about Miranda, and I said no. Five minutes go by and Miranda texts me saying something along the lines of ""I'm so sorry, I need a break"". And she unadded me. I was dumbfounded, I couldn't wrap my brain around the suddenness of this text. Then I clock it: Miranda lied about not liking me anymore and she had just been lying about it this whole time. I felt miserable, I felt that it was all my fault for posting the note and I confided with another mutual of Miranda and I. Today, I am talking to Claire and she randomly says that Miranda had unadded her from instagram and snapchat. I immediately get suspicious and I text the mutual again about it, they say that Miranda was just decluttering her feed and getting rid of people they don't talk to. They also mention that they would not like to be apart of this situation so I stopped talking about it. Around 3 minutes later, Miranda texted me almost telling me off saying that our mutual didn't want to get involved and that everything that I've said to her was bullshit and it meant nothing. I was immediately confused and asked her what I lied about. She then went on a multi-paragraph breakdown of how me saying that she was my best friend was a complete lie and all of my mental health problems (I don't have depression or anything, I've just had long sad phases and I've talked to her about it) were a complete joke. She said that I've never comforted her in her life and that I am just another guy that have fucked her over and basically that we are done. I immediately blocked her on everything and I am now here.

So in our Discord server (40 members), we had two people that were really close friends.

In the past week or two, the girl (let's name her Clara) says she's been developing a crush on the guy (let's name him Mark) and that she doesn't know how he'll react to it since 1. They're really good friends and 2. Mark is aroace.

For the past week or so, Mark had also disappeared from the server and Clara (Mark trusts her enough to send her his problems and other stuff about him) sent us a screenshot of him explaining his mother took his phone for 1 month and that he won't be available for some time.

Clara also told us things about Mark, how his mom is quite insane and how he doesn't have a dad, but she told us to keep it between us 3 (me, Clara, and another friend she trusts enough).

So this brings us to our main event; Clara only confessed last night to us two that she likes Mark, so we kind of were happy about it since (maybe) having a couple in the server would change for once (the server can become very bland at times).

Only problem is, I was at a party yesterday and ate and drank too much, so I've had pretty wild dreams during the night(I drank sodas, I'm a minor) one being that Mark became aroace to cope with his parent issues and that he maybe just needed someone for him to get through this, which, let's admit wasn't a very bright idea to type, but what's even WORSE is that I typed it off in a channel where he could SEE what we were typing, though I didn't know it at first since Clara said she ""made sure Mark couldn't see the chat logs"" to prevent Mark from knowing about her crush. Only thing is, if you ever went on discord, you know there are two ways to hide a channel; remove it from the sight of the user or just hide the previous chat logs. And Clara didn't precise what exactly she did so I thought she removed the channel out of Mark's sight.

Unfortunately, right as I sent that, Mark replied and he seemed ANGRY, but it was mostly due to Clara betraying his trust because she sent us screenshots of their DMs. He wasn't supposed to be back until another 2 weeks and a half but I guess he got back sooner than expected?

Anyways, he said he'll leave the server again and for good, and I've been feeling terrible since then knowing I made someone we all had great friendships with and ruined the possibility for a potential love relationship.

94,1f0ptpg,AITA for walking away?,"My husband has a clingy friend. 

I'll try to make this short and to the point, I'll try to answer questions later.

Here are some different situations that have happened.

My husband's friend, 'Pete' had made it a habit of inviting himself over to our home. Some time ago, my husband, 'Andrew' and I were not in the place to have visitors. I told Pete right now is not a good time, do you mind coming back another day? Pete's response, ""Respectfully, I didn't come to see you, I came to see my friend, I'll leave when he asks me to leave."" Pete and Andrew stared at me in silence.

Later, Andrew and Pete were working out of town together staying in our travel trailer, same company, same schedule, 13/1's (13 days on, 1 day off). The one-day Andrew would come home, Pete faithfully invited himself over. I have him for less than 24hrs every 2 weeks. I asked Pete if he could respect the little time I had to spend with my husband? ONCE AGAIN, the same line, if Andrew wants me to leave, he'll tell me. Long story short, I ended up sending Pete a 'not so nice' message. I hurt his feelings, and I was berated by my husband because of it.

Pete has a girlfriend, Denise. He used to push her to be more like me. Cook like me, dress like me, workout like me, have a career like me, be more driven like me. He would also push Denise to hang out with me more because ""maybe she'll rub off on you."" Pete would compare mine and Andrew's marriage to his relationship during arguments and as the occasional motivation. Again, I asked Andrew to speak to him, it's disrespectful and weird. Then, I started a business. Pete tells Andrew that I will be successful because I am a very attractive woman and that men are more inclined to do business with pretty women. (awkward and uncomfortable). Pete has also invited himself to our date nights a few times. Thankfully, Andrew would tell him no.

More recently, Pete calls Andrew A LOT, to include the ""just calling to make sure you made it safe,"" phone calls. Andrew says Pete is just a really weird and awkward person and lacks social skills, so he doesn't see the harm and I'm just exaggerating.

I have asked Andrew for emotional support over feeling overwhelmed with stress and I was told ""that's what therapy is for."" Weeks later, Pete had called Andrew very late at night because he lost a friend earlier that afternoon. I was called insensitive and irrational because I was bothered that Pete called so late, his friend needed him. My response, ""why didn't you tell him that's what therapy is for?"" 

I believe that I play 2nd fiddle to Pete. Pete has disrespected me and has crossed boundaries, and I've been the bad guy every time for my actions towards him. I feel that he's proved to value his friendship over his marriage. The fact that my husband is prepared to sign the papers I asked for than to discontinue his friendship with Pete speaks volumes to me.

AITA???",Not the A-hole,2024-08-25,"AITA for walking away? My husband has a clingy friend. 

I'll try to make this short and to the point, I'll try to answer questions later.

Here are some different situations that have happened.

My husband's friend, 'Pete' had made it a habit of inviting himself over to our home. Some time ago, my husband, 'Andrew' and I were not in the place to have visitors. I told Pete right now is not a good time, do you mind coming back another day? Pete's response, ""Respectfully, I didn't come to see you, I came to see my friend, I'll leave when he asks me to leave."" Pete and Andrew stared at me in silence.

Later, Andrew and Pete were working out of town together staying in our travel trailer, same company, same schedule, 13/1's (13 days on, 1 day off). The one-day Andrew would come home, Pete faithfully invited himself over. I have him for less than 24hrs every 2 weeks. I asked Pete if he could respect the little time I had to spend with my husband? ONCE AGAIN, the same line, if Andrew wants me to leave, he'll tell me. Long story short, I ended up sending Pete a 'not so nice' message. I hurt his feelings, and I was berated by my husband because of it.

Pete has a girlfriend, Denise. He used to push her to be more like me. Cook like me, dress like me, workout like me, have a career like me, be more driven like me. He would also push Denise to hang out with me more because ""maybe she'll rub off on you."" Pete would compare mine and Andrew's marriage to his relationship during arguments and as the occasional motivation. Again, I asked Andrew to speak to him, it's disrespectful and weird. Then, I started a business. Pete tells Andrew that I will be successful because I am a very attractive woman and that men are more inclined to do business with pretty women. (awkward and uncomfortable). Pete has also invited himself to our date nights a few times. Thankfully, Andrew would tell him no.

I know I sound like a greedy bitch, but I can only get my ice cream every two weeks, so I have an amount I eat everyday so it doesn't run out. So I hid the newest one I got, and told him I didnt buy any more.

Also, I bought it with my own money, so I kinda assumed it was mine. My parents have said before that anything that comes in the house is theirs, which was definitely an oversight on my part.

Plus I got my period two days after this happened, (im not using this to excuse my behavior, just to understand) so I was definitely acting different than I should've.

My mom has told me not to get mad, and that it wasnt that big of a thing to be mad at. That makes me kinda annoyed since all ive done to show my anger is a little sass, and what my dad does when he's angry is a lot worse.

96,1f0pnns,AITA for telling a friend to leave an outing after being rude to the group. ,"Being a little vague since I don't know if the person I am talking about has an account. 

I (27f) had a friend, who we will call ""Adam"" (32m), who is also an ex. We broke up after 1.5 years due to differing expectations of the relationship. It was a hard breakup, but we stayed friends. Everything was fine until I began dating again. 

I started dating ""Abel"" (28m). Abel was aware that I had dated and was still friends with Adam. Once I told Adam about Abel, Adam began acting strange. It began with inappropriate comments on mine and Adam's previous sex life. Then it was comments about how Adam couldn't get hugs anymore because I was dating Abel, and would immediately stop texting if Adam knew I was hanging out with Abel (I never asked Adam to do this). Then Adam demanded that Abel not be in my home while he was there, saying he wasn’t comfortable around Abel. At this point, Adam and Abel had met once, and exchanged pleasantries but no deep conversation. I told Adam that he wasn't able to dictate who was allowed in my home. I asked if Adam would be more comfortable with another person that he knew while around Abel and I. Adam said yes.

Later, I, a mutual friend, and Adam were wanting to go to a local festival. I asked if Abel would be welcome. Both Adam and the mutual friend said yes. At the festival, the mutual friend, Abel, and I arrived together a little late. We waited for Adam at the meeting place after letting him know we had arrived. After ~20 minutes, Adam sulked up to us, greeting the mutual friend and I, but barely acknowledging Abel. We apologized for being late, but Adam rolled his eyes and glowered. We began walking, but Adam wouldn't walk with the group. We made efforts to include Abel in conversation, but he would just shrug. When looking at an art stall, Adam stood far away from the group. I walked over to ask if he was going to look around with us. Adam shrugged. I prompted some more for Adam to join the rest of the group, but all that I received clipped responses. I finally said, without making a scene, that if he wasn't having a good time that maybe he should go home. I then went back to the rest of the group. After telling Adam to go home, he proceeded the follow the group around, glaring and looming over us. He didn't say anything to the group or interact, just followed. 

After the festival, Adam an I had a phone that mostly comprised of him yelling at me. Adam said that he was uncomfortable with Abel being there, even though the mutual friend was there. I asked why he didn't say anything, and Adam said that he doesn't tell people about his emotions, and that I shouldn't have even invited Abel in the first place since Adam was invited first. Adam continued to yell at me until I was sobbing. I asked why he even stayed at the festival, and Adam admitted it was because he wanted Abel and myself to feel uncomfortable.

97,1f0pndf,AITA Removing shoes in a public place ,"So, recently, my very long term doctor's office was absorbed into a trendy physio thingy. They gutted the place, and redesigned it to look all cool and modern. My doctor's clinic got some paint and flooring.

The physio place now demands that all people entering the place remove their shoes, or put on the huge felt like slippers over their shoes.

My last visit, I politely declined to remove my shoes or to wear the booties.

99,1f0pfyt,WIBTA if I told my Mom to start respecting me,"Hi, long time lurker, first time poster. I never really thought I'd post here, but here we are. Throw away account because my mom would recognize my main.

I will try to keep things brief. Basically, things have been a little weird with my mom and I want to call her out and tell her to respect me as an adult, but I don't know if I'm overreacting. There's too many examples to go through here, but I will go through the biggest ones for me.

I, (22 F) have been working on a huge remodeling project that has taken a lot of blood, sweat, and tears over the past months.

Recently, it got to the point where it wasn't fun or good for me anymore, and it started taxing my mental health really badly. There was a week straight I couldn't sleep because of nightmares, and would break down crying.

So after I made the connection that the project was causing all that stress on me, I decided to pull the plug and sell the project to any other DIY people who can handle it. Yeah, I won't be making any money on it that way, but I thought it was worth it for my mental health.

My mom told me I should suck it up and finish the remodel. I don't want to quote her exactly because then she might recognize the post, but that is the gist of what she said. That I should get over it and get it done anyway.

She said she'd help with the remodel herself to make it easier for me, but she's been saying that for months now, and never has helped, so I frankly don't believe her.

She also doesn't listen to me in a lot of extremely important things (to me.) It bothers me that she texts and drives, I ask her to stop, she ignores me (multiple times.) She wants a hug, I don't want to be touched, she pushes until I relent and let her hug (one time thing.) Stuff like that. I don't have the characters to list more examples.

I also am uncomfortable with how she talks about me to her spouse, which is a guy I've only known for a year. She assumed something a little bad about me, and instead of talking to me, she told her spouse and he got mad. She talked to me after he got mad, starting the conversation with “Spouse is mad that you're deciding that.”

Final example, someone was subtly insulting my art hobby with AI comments (he didn't mean anything by it, he was just clueless,) and she started defending him, knowing exactly what she was saying.

This isn't everything, but it's the most important stuff. I have talked with her a little about some of the issues, and although she apologized, it never changed anything. Which is why I'm asking if I'd be in the wrong to basically tell her to get her shit together and treat me with more respect.

Thanks in advance, I'm willing to answer any questions, maybe give more examples if asked, but at that point, maybe I should just get therapy lol.

Tl;dr My mom might be subtly disrespecting me and I need advice on if I'm reading too much into it or if I need to call her out on it.

It was very obviously broken and the first thing I thought to do was call my husband to come back. He came back within minutes and called an ambulance. When the ambulance took me, he said bye and to let him know any updates and he went to work. Him going to work at this point i understood as he has his own business and it’s only him and another guy, plus it’s a broken ankle nothing worse. He texted me an hour later saying “call me when you get out i’ll pick you up” as if picking me up from work lol. 

I planned to keep him in the loop via text as much as I could, and I’ll admit i was scared at one point because I didn’t have pulses in my foot so a bunch of people came into my room explaining they needed to reduce the fracture immediately. So they put me out while they did that, thankfully a kind nurse held my hand until I was asleep lol. 

Once I was awake and back to baseline, I was in a hallway bed waiting for ortho who eventually came to me and said I’ll need surgery that night. I asked him to bring me some things but they wouldn’t let him in he tried but ended up leaving.

Once I was in a room it was late-ish but i told him visiting hours are 24/7 come whenever or tomorrow (bc we haven’t heard about when they were to do the surgery yet). He said ok he’ll stop by tomorrow but he has to go to the bank at 930 so he’ll see when he can come pick me up. I never said anything about picking me up lol. Anyway I said ok, i’ll keep you updated. 

An hour later I text him i’m going into surgery. No answer. I text him when i’m awake after surgery. no answer (tbf it’s 1am lol). HOWEVER. I later learn he did not have his phone on ringer and the surgeon tried calling him, and he didn’t pick up.

Fast forward the next day he eventually picks me up in the early afternoon, and I learn he ended up not going to the bank or anything. He never came to the hospital to see me all morning or afternoon, only came to pick me up. 

Anyway a week later i told him i was upset about him not being there or having his phone on (what if something in the surgery happened and she needed to reach him?). He was sorry but didn’t know it was a big deal bc no one came to see him when he was in the hospital (which was before we even met, like 15 years ago). I said that I’m his wife, he should’ve been there at some point for me, i was scared, i had to have surgery!!!

101,1f0onzl,AITA friend only asks favors,"
My friend (24F) and I (23F) have known each other since we were around 14. We met in school and were part of a trio of girls. Back in high school, I was the one who handled most of the work for subjects like English, History, Spanish, and Philosophy—anything related to arts and humanities. I wasn’t great at math, but neither were they, and they didn’t offer much help. I ended up doing all the work, including our final graduation project. To this day, Daisy insists she was involved, which annoys me because, in gatherings, she takes credit for things she didn’t do.

After graduation, Daisy only ever reached out when she needed something. She never contacted me just to check in or see how I was doing—it was always to ask for favors or help. I distanced myself from her for about a year due to lingering resentment. Recently, I tried reconnecting with her. Daisy invited me to a pricey bar, and when I said I couldn’t afford it, she insisted on going because her boyfriend worked there and she’d cover the bill. I agreed.

Three days later, she asked me for nearly $1,000, claiming she had debt. That’s basically my entire salary, so I told her I couldn’t help. She then asked me to pay for the drinks, which was ridiculous since she had said she’d cover them. I tried to let it go as a misunderstanding.

Am I the asshole for not helping her with this test that was easy for me to do?",Not enough info,2024-08-25,"AITA friend only asks favors 
My friend (24F) and I (23F) have known each other since we were around 14. We met in school and were part of a trio of girls. Back in high school, I was the one who handled most of the work for subjects like English, History, Spanish, and Philosophy—anything related to arts and humanities. I wasn’t great at math, but neither were they, and they didn’t offer much help. I ended up doing all the work, including our final graduation project. To this day, Daisy insists she was involved, which annoys me because, in gatherings, she takes credit for things she didn’t do.

After graduation, Daisy only ever reached out when she needed something. She never contacted me just to check in or see how I was doing—it was always to ask for favors or help. I distanced myself from her for about a year due to lingering resentment. Recently, I tried reconnecting with her. Daisy invited me to a pricey bar, and when I said I couldn’t afford it, she insisted on going because her boyfriend worked there and she’d cover the bill. I agreed.

102,1f0omyv,WIBTA for telling my mom to not pull me out of school?,"I (16F) go to private school. Though my family is not extremely rich, I think we are upper middle class. My parents both work hard to send me to this school and I'm extremely grateful to be here. My school costs about 25-26k a year. 

I left public school after 8th grade because I parents wanted me to be in a smaller school setting. At public school I didn't really have a set friend group or many friends in general. I feel like after going to private school, I have changed as a person and met many great people/ close friends. 

Well, recently over the summer my mom (46F) has been saying I was addicted to my phone. This isn't the first time she said this to me; she has been saying this for many years now. Over the summer she told me to use my phone for less than 2 hours a day and every night I should send my screen time to her. She said if I do not follow this rule and break it, she'll pull me out of private school and that I would be going to public school. 

This week, I started school. With school going on, I tended to use my phone more like using it to look at my schedule, texting with friends, and even playing gamepigeon with my friends during study hall free. With my mom and myself being quite busy after school started, I forgot to send my screen time to her. This weekend, she looks at my screen time and is shocked that I exceeded the 2 hour limit and said she is going to pull me out of school.

I'm not sure how reasonable this is... she googled the amount teens are supposed to use their phones and used it on me. With only being able to use my phone for 2 hours I feel like shes making me choose either to have a social life and exceed the limit or do literally nothing with my friends and have no social life. If she pulls me out of school I would be the sadded person in the world! (not an exaggeration) this school makes me feel so safe and confortable.

Lately, more often than not, we end up just sitting around their apartment when I come by. Nothing very interesting planned. 

This weekend, I came by and planned to stay for a couple nights. We ended up canceling an activity because my partner wasn’t feeling up to it; they suffer from an auto immune disease that really wipes them out and causes various other physical discomforts. Sometimes it’s worse than other times and my partner able to push through. Sometimes, only rest/sleep will help them feel better. There is nothing that I can do to help them feel better either. The flair ups sort of just have to run their course. 

I’ve essentially spent the better part of the last 30 hours I’ve been at their place alone/lonely, because they’ve been resting/asleep. 

I’m not mad at all. I entirely understand they have no control over how they’re feeling, to what degree and how much pushing through they can do. I am, however, sad, feeling lonely and disappointed about how the weekend ended up. I feel like going home so I can at least get a good nights sleep in my own bed and wake up with the hopes of salvaging what’s left of the weekend. 

This is not a situation where I’m not down to stick by their side when they’re sick; I’ve done this many many many times over the course of our long term relationship. 

And unfortunately, there’s nothing my presence will do to make them feel better; aside from just “being there”, but we aren’t talking or doing any sort of anything together when they’re asleep. 

Am I the asshole for wanting to leave and go home because my partner is essentially sick/tired and needs to rest? Should I grin and bare it, sleep in the spare room and hope tomorrow is better?

Me partner and I don’t live together and only get to see each other 1-2x a week. When time allows, I’ll stay at their place for a couple days. 

Lately, more often than not, we end up just sitting around their apartment when I come by. Nothing very interesting planned. 

This weekend, I came by and planned to stay for a couple nights. We ended up canceling an activity because my partner wasn’t feeling up to it; they suffer from an auto immune disease that really wipes them out and causes various other physical discomforts. Sometimes it’s worse than other times and my partner able to push through. Sometimes, only rest/sleep will help them feel better. There is nothing that I can do to help them feel better either. The flair ups sort of just have to run their course. 

I’ve essentially spent the better part of the last 30 hours I’ve been at their place alone/lonely, because they’ve been resting/asleep. 

I’m not mad at all. I entirely understand they have no control over how they’re feeling, to what degree and how much pushing through they can do. I am, however, sad, feeling lonely and disappointed about how the weekend ended up. I feel like going home so I can at least get a good nights sleep in my own bed and wake up with the hopes of salvaging what’s left of the weekend. 

This is not a situation where I’m not down to stick by their side when they’re sick; I’ve done this many many many times over the course of our long term relationship. 

And unfortunately, there’s nothing my presence will do to make them feel better; aside from just “being there”, but we aren’t talking or doing any sort of anything together when they’re asleep.

110,1f0nh12,AITA for somebody else saying a slur?,"I, (M14) have just been removed from National Honor Society because another kid (M14) started screaming the N-word in class. 

This started when I was in band class (not a band kid,kid in band) and we had just walked in. Me and my friend were messing around, and I say to Henry, ""what do we hate?"" expecting him to say a classmate that we don't like (fuck you aubrey) or somebody else. He instead starts screaming the n-word extremely loud. I mean he is screaming this so loud that the teacher hears it and sends him to the office. I am called up to the office, and I expect to tell my story of what happens. 

I walk into the assistant principal's office, ""Dr. Asshole""  and she already looks pissed at me. I tell her what happened, and she says this is bullying. I don't know how this is bullying and I am confused, I ask how and she says I am getting joy out of hurting somebody else. To be clear, I was not forcing Henry to say anything, we didn't even bring up the N-word, he chose to say it, neurodivergent or not, thats on him, not me. 

Early that day we had an whole talk with the main principal about the rules, and they said there was a zero tolerance policy for bullying, and you would get 10 days suspension. However, Dr. Asshole did not give me any suspension or detention or anything, because they don't have anything on me. She says is going to have a talk with the main principal about this and then will decide whether or not she will tell the honor society sponsors. It is obvious that they all want me out of honor society, because they don't want to tell me, but they stare at me whenever they go on their cryptic speeches. 

So about ten minutes later, when I am back in class I am called into the hallway by the nicer sponsor, because the other one is teaching at another school. She gives me the dues back and says, ""i'm sorry buddy."" I go to the bathroom, and cry for the first time in a year. Luckily I hear a counselor that I am close to in the hallway. I ask to talk to her and she agrees to. I tell her what happens, and she really helped me get thru it. 

I leave and get on the bus and text my friends, and I having been gaslit, think that it is still my fault, and they are super confused, they say it's not my fault at all and I start to think about it, and I tell my parents. My mom had already talked to the school and the school actually violated HIPAA whenever they disclosed some of Henry's information to her over the phone.

If you remember, the main Principal was giving a speech on rules all day, so how would they have talked so fast, well they didn't. She actually was confused when my parents emailed her.  Dr. Asshole could not have told both of the sponsors what actually happened so fast, because one of them was at the other school, and she probably just told the chill one that I was ""bullying.""

111,1f0n8mx,AITA for being concerned about my friend?,"I am using a throwaway account because my friend occasionally views Reddit posts.

I (17M?) got into an argument with my best friend, M (17F) a few days ago because she has mental health issues that have long been a sore spot in our friendship.

My relationship with M is fairly normal, but she tries to play therapist for me often. It comes from a place of care, but I do admittedly get irritated sometimes because I don't know why M insists on trying to ""fix"" me. Not only would I not consider myself someone who is largely troubled, but her respective issues, like being deathly afraid of even the THREAT of contamination, or her struggles with identifying her sexuality, among other sore spots, are clearly much more of a concern than anything that I could possibly have going on. I have a stable home life where I wouldn't need to solely confide in her, for one thing.

Our latest row involves news I received from someone close to both of us. This person sent me a text message asking if I had seen M because she was nowhere to be found in their shared flat. This is quite uncharacteristic for M, but I thought nothing of it until I received a text message from M herself. Thankfully, she was all right, but her text message made it clear enough that she was in the midst of a mental health episode and so I was worried all throughout the following school day.

This is the part where I may be TA. M must have noticed that I was acting strangely, because she cornered me to question my behavior, and I unintentionally blurted out everything that had been on my mind; I was worried about her, and yesterday had deeply freaked me out, and that she should focus on her own mental wellbeing instead of mine. I will admit that I yelled this at her, but quickly tried to retract my words and apologize.

However, M didn't want to hear it and our mutual friends were quite upset afterwards because they hadn't known about the day before until I said that. I don't think M had wanted them to know, especially because she had once asked me to keep such things private from them (we have a certain agreement between us two that we will keep our respective mental struggles away from our other friends, for their sake).

The thing is. even if I was being an ass I think it was worth it because I think M needs to see a therapist or something. I heard that her guardian offered it once, but she refused because she claims that she doesn't need anything like that and she's perfectly fine. What's even more baffling is that our other friends are siding with her, and I really don't get why? They're just as aware as I am about her problems, minus a few intimate details here and there that she never shared with them, but it's enough that I thought they would understand why I felt the way I do.

I make a large salary now working a demanding job.  When I get paid (monthly), a portion of the paycheck goes into an account from which I pay all the bills (no leftovers), a portion goes into a joint account for fun purchases, and a portion goes into a savings account for emergencies/a house. I also send some directly to my husband's personal account for more fun purchases. He sometimes works gigs and will make a little money off that which is occasionally shared between us but is usually spent by him. Most months, my husband spends everything in the joint fun account before I get a chance to make any fun purchases for myself. 

I got paid yesterday, and my husband has already spent 3/4 of the fun money on a night out with a friend. Today, he told me to transfer him $250 to his personal account so he could buy a pair of cool shoes. I told him we didn't have that much left in the fun account and we shouldn't transfer from savings just so he could have new shoes after he already spent almost everything set aside for fun.

I (19F) moved out of my parents home recently and decided to sell clothes that have been sitting in my closet for years on Depop. There is nothing of particularly high value. Mostly things I wore in high school.

My friend (20F) lent me a top 4 years ago when we were 15 and 16. It’s a crop top from Pac Sun that I’d honestly forgotten she’d given to me. We used to live a 30 minute drive without traffic from each other and so we didn’t hang out often. I see her about 10 times a year, and that number was lowered to once in a blue moon by the time we got to college. She goes to school a few states away and is there most of the summer. She’d given me the top because we were going to some restaurant for her birthday, and my T-shirt didn’t fit the theme well enough. I went home right afterward and didn’t stop by her house. She has been to my house so many times and never asked about the shirt. I’d forgotten that she lent it to me and that I had it.

While going through my closet I found it and listed it online to sell. I hadn’t seen my friend since my winter break and I know she wouldn’t be in town anytime soon. I thought that because it had been such a long time, she wouldn’t care. She saw the listing on Depop and blew up at me over text.

114,1f0mxiz,WIBTA if I told my son's friend's parents that their daughter is causing my son to have psychological problems.,"I have a son (14M) who was a normal kid until a little more than 2 years ago. He had a large group of friends back then until he started adopting views that made him soft on everything and he started to get made fun of amongst his friends.

During this time, a girl in his class, let's call her Alison actively befriended him, he was confused at first because it was like out of nowhere she just started talking to him and having conversations at first. I did not mind as I felt it would get his mind of things until he got back into better terms with his original friend group and things blow over.

However instead of that he became friends with her friends and his interests and started changing. The thing is almost all his new friends are girls while before that they were all boys and this is turning him into a weird kid even when it comes to the way he speaks and acts more like a girl. He has become a lot closer to his sister as well.

He will participate in conversations about girl stuff with them like opinions about which dress looks better on them etc. The only masculine hobbies he still has is that he is nerdy, likes computers etc but somehow even there he has found girls that share his hobby of tinkering with computers and learning to code etc.

I think this is bad for his psychological health and might lead to problems later on. As an adult or even older teen if he does not form male friendships now, he will have no one, once his current friends find partners and get married. He also needs to know how to interact with men.

I don't think there is an easy way for me to tell him this so I was thinking of speaking with Alison's parents and telling them to ask her to back off a little and let him reconnect with the guys he was friends with and to not bad mouth them but i don't know if they will take kindly to that as they are very supportive of it since my son has gotten her into science and she and my son are the best students in class.

I live about 6 hours away from where we are having the groom’s bachelor party and my wife and I had to work it into our schedule and budget because of this as well as money being very tight(she’s doing a residency and I am between jobs due to a layoff). Unfortunately, best man is TERRIBLE at planning. We originally slated to have the bachelor party from the 31st of August to the morning of September 2nd. Total cost was going to be $160 per person just for the AirBnB plus some other out of pocket events and expenses.
I just got a text from the best man saying he has now booked the AirBnB for the 30th of August to the 1st of September; the dates have been moved up by one day. Seeing as how the 30th is Friday, I will not be able to make it to the first half of the party because my wife works on Fridays, we only have one car, and we had planned the whole weekend so that she would stay home and I would drive 6 hours away to this party which would put me there at about 3am-4am on Saturday.

I’m pretty upset to say the least. I have been trying to get information from the best man but it’s like pulling teeth and he would just not respond to texts or calls for days. Then he just suddenly jumps back onto the text chain and little over a week out telling us the dates changed. Now because of his miscommunication, I need to pay full price for something I only get to experience half of. I would rather use that other half of the money and buy something for the couple as a wedding gift instead of the best man pocketing the money for his neglectfulness. There are others in the group who have been affected by this and won’t be able to make it as well. Worst of all, I hate that I won’t be able to spend nearly as much time with my friend at his bachelor party.

At the end of it though, would I be the asshole for only wanting to pay half of the AirBnB fee?

119,1f0mju3,AITA for accidentally teaching my nephew a dirty joke?,"The other day I (18M) was at a family party with a bunch of my cousins. At these parties, usually the smaller kids play with each other, then the middle schoolers, and then high schoolers/early college people. Every now and then someone from the older group will chime in to the younger crowd just out of curiosity or to mess around.

The other day my cousins and I pulled a prank on our other cousin (who is also our age). The prank is the RUN prank, where the person touches their toes and is forced to spell RUN a few times. If it doesn’t make sense, look it up. It’s hilarious because the person being pranked doesn’t know what they’re doing until the third time.

My nephew (8M) saw all of this happen. We didn’t realize that him and other small relatives were watching. Regardless, we hoped that they would brush it off since it was assumed they don’t know what’s funny about it.

Well, after this entire week, my nephew unfortunately knows what it means. Apparently he went to school and started making random kids do it. In the moment, apparently he didn’t know why it was funny. He just saw us laughing so he wanted to repeat it. Some of the kids obviously knew what it meant.

One of the teachers saw my nephew doing this, and he was taken straight to the principals office. The principal also spoke to his mom (my cousin), and explained everything.

Now my cousin is livid with me, and because I was the one asking my other cousin to spell RUN, my nephew only mentioned my name. I tried explaining to my cousin that he wasn’t part of the prank in any way, and he just accidentally saw.

I'd largely been silent about it besides a few times a year squeaking out a sheepish ""*^(can you not?)*"", which was rejected. I finally felt confident enough to push back several times. I'd see them with my socks & I would lay out my grievances:

* They were rough on socks: drag their feet on concrete, or step on something sticky & not immediately addressing it until the goo & sock are in quantum entanglement.
* Jes loves to mismatch, would take just one sock from me & now I have odd socks in the drawer. Heightens OCD tendencies
* I'd know how many socks were left before next laundry day, then wake up **SURPRISE**: out of socks. Triggers anxiety, resource guarding ^(I grew up just below the poverty line.)

They felt ""*since we love each other, we share everything*,"" but apologized & said they didn't know how much it bothered me. Promised to keep it in mind & also try to plan better. The next 6 months every time I'd address them wearing my socks it was met with ""*Doh! Shoot, sorry.*"" & ""*Ah, sorry!

 Also this is a bit long, so if that bothers you, maybe scroll instead of commenting “I did not order a Yappuccino” as I’m kind of angry and probably will insult you and your family.

I live with my mom and stepfather, as well as my younger brother (4). I will be keeping my age confidential for the sake of not being taken less seriously, but I am underage. 

My younger brother will be five soon, and my mother and stepfather have always been very soft on him, even when he did something serious. Whenever me or my sister expressed concern about this, they’d always brush it off as us being moody teenagers, and respond with “You’re not the parent.”

Tonight I was laying downstairs in our house, and he ran in trying to spray his friend with the hose. I told him to not spray it inside, so he dropped it and started to run off, before tripping. I’ll admit, I giggled at the sudden display of immediate karma. 

He got angry and started running around the basement spraying things, all my clothes, my device, my school papers, and my sketchbook. 

I ran upstairs to grab my parents after quickly putting away everything I could (that being my laptop and phone) and told them what was going on. 

They ran downstairs to stop him, and told him off. We had a friend over that night, the mother of the friend of my brother’s I mentioned before, and she as well as my stepfather ran downstairs to stop him. 



After getting things cleaned up, I sat on the deck with our family friend, and talked to her about it. 



My stepfather came outside after a few minutes and stopped me to talk. I’ll admit I went off on him a bit. I was calm though, I knew he wouldn’t respond even semi seriously to anything else. 



I explained to him why we’d get upset in situations like these, how messed up it was for us to worry about him like that, as he often said, we are not his parents, nor are we adults. After a few minutes it seemed like he was genuinely receptive, until I repeated myself and he just told me to shut up. 



I went downstairs, a bit annoyed that he once again brushed me off. My mother came down later and said that what he’d told her was that I was ‘lecturing him’ she went off on us, how rude and stupid we were, how fucked up it was (her words) that we were commenting on it, how ungrateful we must be.  



My sister was the main one to do the talking, as I was a bit scared in all honesty to get reprimanded by the much more emotional and harsh parent. She told my mother that she was being childish, (and she was) and my mother responded by calling her a jerk and storming away. 



Now she is claiming to start ‘hard ass parenting’ (again, her words) tomorrow. I am a bit confused, as my stepfather initially thanked me for speaking my mind, but now I was being punished for it.

On the drive back home, she was convinced the worker just wasn't paying attention and was complaining about it.

I was completely oblivious. I’ve never experienced this pressure and she said because I’m a guy and she’s a young girl. ",0.0,1.0416866540908813,1,0

fast forward to 1 1/2 week post op I got public transport, I have a cane and a brace etc so it was bearable but a three hour trip (an hour was waiting, schedules didn't line up) she insisted on picking me up as the station's a five min drive from her's, I kept her up to date of my arrival time as I travelled (passing x, will be at yours in x mins) so she knew when I'd be there.  

I arrive, walk across the bridge to the carpark, she's not there, text her, no answer, 15 mins pass I get 'loading up car to grab groceries, I'll come get you after' replied I'd rather she grabbed me first, I could sit in the car while she went for groceries, she'd have to drive past to go there anyway.  

She said she'd be quick I said hey I'd prefer you come grab me first, there's no shade or seats. She has one of those big jeeps so no space issue, (and the prior surgery I had she left me in the car to run errands all the time so not a leaving me in the car issue either) plus I had food for us, and walking uphill up the bridge to go back into the station to sit would be a no go with my stitches.

No reply for 10 mins, I'm struggling, the icepacks keeping the food I brought cold were completely melted because there was no shade to stand in, food is starting to get iffy. I try and get an uber for the 5 min drive, it gets picked up and dropped repeatedly for 20 mins before I text her again.  

She replies be there in ten mins, I say cool see you then. 20 mins pass, I'm *mad* I text her and say if she's not here in the next 10 I'm going home.  

No response 15 mins pass, I'm done. Time to tackle the bridge and leave, that and 20 mins sitting waiting for the train, no text, on the train 10-15 mins and get 'here, where are you?' I'm peeved, I type and delete a dozen things, she says texts 'all that and you're making me wait'  

I replied 'read my last message, I'm on the train talk to you when I get home' she said 'don't bother'  

Texted her when I got home, no reply. Woke up to messages from our friends about how selfish it was, that I skipped her party, that I left without telling her and she was worried, that I should have just gotten an uber or walked if I was that impatient etcetc no text from her.  

I felt justified at the time, but the last three days all I've gotten is people telling me I should have waited, I was already there so what was the point of going back, that giving her a ten minute time limit/ultimatum and leaving was rude/it was entitled to expect to be picked up because she's not my chauffeur. So now I'm feeling awful about it.

127,1f0lpo8,AITA for refusing to give my best friend a birthday gift I spent 70 hours on?,"
      Here's some context. I make pottery, and tend to give away hand built pottery to my best friends for their birthday. This year, I came up with the awesome idea of a 3 tiered birthday cake cabinet set. (It's a pretty big ceramic cake with little cabinets in it) I shared this idea with her and told her I was making it. 
    2 weeks later, I had already spent 15 hours on it and I only had minimal progress handbuilding it, let alone decorating it, firing it or painting it. I told her I couldn't give it away as the project was way bigger than I previously imagined. I offered to make her a birthday cake stacking pot set (a lot easier than making cabinets!), or a teapot. She took it a lot easier than I thought and just said ""ok"". I assumed she was a bit hurt but understood.         
        I went and made her Girtha, named by her slightly girthy spout. I kept giving her updates on the cake since she seemed to take the gift thing well, and I normally show her my pottery process all the time. We were fine until yesterday, when I was complaining about how much time I've put into it, and how I'd never make one ever again without getting paid 1000 dollars. 
       To surprise, she said she was even more honored I was making it for her! .... let me just say she didn't take it well when I told her I wasn't giving it to her and she must have not read my texts from last month? She feels like I didn't take her into account during this whole process, and she couldn't believe I could ever do this to her?                 
      Like I understand that I shouldn't have told her about her birthday gift until it was finalized and finished bc stuff can happen that you don't expect with pottery. It was my bad, and I made a questionable decision in my excitement to share this epic cake idea with her. And it's one that really hurt her. I just don't think she understands that 70 hours is 70 hours and I didn't know that would happen and it's not like I cheated on her or betrayed her and that's how she's acting? Like it's not like I didn't offer to make her another cake??                 
 Her birthday is in November, I have ample time? It's not crazy for me to only spend 20 hours on gifts? That's still A LOT? Like I immediately told her when I realized this wasn't gonna happen and I didn't lead her on. Like, I'm sorry it's my bad and next time I'm keeping gifts under wraps so I don't disappoint or hurt anyone if I change my mind on what I'm making them. But girl, I offered to make her a similar gift that's 25 hours max rather than 70. 
     I told her this 2 weeks after bringing up the gift idea to her (and she skipped over all my texts about it and only read the last one?) but it does make this exponentially worse as she's been looking forward to this cake for 2 months now without me even knowing??? That's the worse part for me. It makes sense she's hurt and to ask that I don't share anything about her birthday gift so I don't disappoint her, but cmon it's not a crime to make something easier than something that would end up taking 70 hours?

I’m fine with that because it’s natural to grow apart, and I don’t expect constant updates from old friends.

The issue is that despite this distance, she recently asked me to be a bridesmaid at her wedding. I was surprised, especially since I was considering whether to attend at all. She did come to my wedding five years ago, which was a destination event, so I feel a bit guilty for not wanting to go. But we’re not as close anymore, and it feels disingenuous to accept such a significant role.

Her wedding is in New York on December 23rd, which is going to be expensive and difficult to get to from Washington. Her choice of dates also seems like she didn’t really take into consideration her friends’ travel complexities because getting married two days before Christmas in New York just seems insane. Some of our friends are going to be flying in from India and they’re going to be visiting US for the first time in December, which in my opinion is the worst time of the year.

This is the first semester I've ever had issues with a roommate so its possible I went about this in the wrong way. 

Angela has a boyfriend who is in our apartment every single day and I dont mean he is just showing up and staying in her room the whole time. I mean he is always in the living room watching movies loudly, cooking in the kitchen for 2 hours straight, using the bathroom (clogging it and then just leaving it like that). I swear I cant leave my room without seeing that man in the apartment.

Anyway, point is I started feeling really uncomfortable, not just because he was always in the way, but also because Angela gave him her dorm key so he was coming and going into the apartment whenever he wanted. I ended up telling the RA that I was having issues with him after he made me late to an important orientation because he was SHOWERING for like 2 hours. He does not live here, in my opinion he should not be able to shower here especially for that long. 

Angela never asked me if I was okay with her boyfriend being over by the way. Her and Robin moved into the apartment before me so when I moved in this was already happening. The RA ended up pulling us into a meeting where they basically told her he's not allowed to have the key and he cant sleep over for more than 3 nights in a row and he cant use our shower. Well she got mad that I ""snitched"" and now its just an uncomfortable situation, for me especially lol.

After the meeting she called me an AH for not talking to her directly about it instead of going to the RA.

Our dad & mom they are divorced and are out of state so they aren't options to take in nephew. My sister could go stay with our dad/mom but doesn't want to. She wants to stay in our state and close to her life. Which I get. But would I be the asshole to take in my nephew and tell her that she  and her family have to go out of state for help?

133,1f0kg97,AITA for living at home and not doing any work? ,"I'm a second year community college student. Due to health issues that kept me out of school for significant periods of time, I didn't have the best GPA, so despite having a 36 ACT, I didn't get into any good colleges. I decided to do community college and transfer.

My strategy so far has been signing up for classes that are entirely online and done at your own pace, as in turning in homework and taking tests whenever within the semester. I would then spend the first week or two doing all the work, and spend the rest of the semester working on extracurriculars such as running my own business and also hanging out with friends, chilling, watching Netflix, and so on. 

My parents think I'm being lazy by spending months essentially doing nothing. But I don't think that's the case, I'm doing my work efficiently enough that I have a 4.0 GPA. They think I should do more, but I don't see why.

134,1f0k8r4,AITA for not inviting my ex husband/his family to one out of two bday parties I had for my kids? ,"
First time poster, and it’s a long one so I apologize in advance. 

I have 2 children with my ex husband. My kids birthdays are literally one day apart. For birthdays I always have done one party, with two cakes/two different themes to make it more individualized for each child.

Rewind to last year, it’s birthday time. I invite friends from school, my family, my exs family, work friends of mine, etc. Important context- I invite my Ex SIL Jane (fake name), and her son Parker (also fake name). I have never met them in person as she lived multiple states away until she recently moved closer. 

It was an at home birthday with rented inflatables. Everyone shows, and it started off great. Until it wasn’t. Parker started misbehaving. I’m not talking misbehaving as a normal 5yo might. He was screaming, having tantrums, not playing nicely with any of the other kids, not sharing toys/games I had put out, and hit several other kids in attendance. He even shoved a toddler down because he wanted to go first on the inflatable slide. It was so bad just about everyone except family started leaving before we could even cut the cake. At this point I was at my limit, and kicked both Jane & Parker out. He had an immense fit, ended up grabbing a knife I had on the table for the cakes, and stabbed one of the inflatables putting a massive gash in it.

Jane did not offer to pay for the damages, nor did she try to apologize. It was just “oh kids act that way” “you’re being ridiculous”. My ex nor his family said anything to her, and just said they didn’t want to be involved. I ended up paying 3k in damages to the inflatable company. 

This year I decided to throw two parties. One as I usually did, and the other for my ex & his family. 

The first party was a week before the one we originally have. I did the usual inflatables, games, photo booths, etc. Neither my ex, nor any of his family was invited so it was fair and I wasn’t excluding just Jane and Parker. Everything was great, and everyone had a wonderful time. 

The next week we do the second party. My family, and my exs family are there. I had everything else as the other party at this one, excluding inflatables as I was not risking paying another few thousand if Parker’s behavior had not changed within the last year. Everything goes okay, we did have some outbursts from Parker, but no one was injured this go around so it went a lot more smooth. 

It is now a couple weeks later, and I started getting blew up with text messages from my ex/his fam saying how awful I am for throwing two parties, and acting as if they were “too stupid to find out”. I ignored it at first, but the messages continued so I eventually started a group chat and just explained to each of them that I did what I did due to everything that happened last year.

136,1f0jiz2,AITA For Kidnapping my Mom?,"There is a lot of background, but here’s the short version. 

Background: My mom and her wife, “Mia”, have been married for about 10 years. They dated for only 6 months and they both seemed very happy. After they were married, that changed drastically. Anytime we visited, Mia would become angry that mom was spending time with us even if we included Mia. Mia quit multiple jobs without warning and bought two brand new cars, they have never been rich. At the time of this incident, Mia’s daughter “Tay” was living with them.

Nov of 2023, my mom broke her leg while trying to build a bed frame for Tay. It was caused by tripping over their 5 dogs. Mia chose not to tell my brother or me anything, and they went to the hospital. I only found out hours later when my Tay called my wife, this was against Mia's wishes. 

The surgery went well, but mom had a metal plate and several screws due to how bad her leg was. Per the doctor, mom should not be left alone for 6 weeks. So my wife and I set up a plan to support mom and take time off work to assist. Most of the work was done by my wife. She is incredible. Mom's friends would also pitch in as much as they could. Mom's siblings were willing to assist, but Mia hated them and kept them away.

In Dec, my wife and I had a trip pre-planned for a week. We were assured by Mia that Mom would be taken care of, Mia’s 2 children would be able to assist in caring for her. After we returned Xmas Day, I got a call from mom asking me to come stay with her the next day which was strange considering what Mia told us before the trip.

When I got there I found out that no one took care of her for the week we were out of town. She hadn't had a shower in over a week, she was given food when they remembered, dog crap was all over the floor, dishes were piled high, and mom didn't have her Cpap mask. Mias children who were supposed to take care of her, got into a physical fight on xmas day and stormed off with no idea when they would come back. 

So we said ""F this"", my wife works from home, and I had the week off, so we were able to take care of her. Since it was the only day everyone was available to assist with getting her to our place, we moved her that day. Tey returned as we were moving mom. Mom tried to call Mia but she didn’t answer. When Tey called Her to tell her about the move, Mia was livid. 

Mia called mom that night and argued with mom. Mom repeatedly said that she was just going to a place where she could get the help she needed. Mia then blamed Mom and us saying this was the worst thing Mom ever did to her. That she was doing her best and mom leaving was uncalled for and we kidnapped mom. Tey disagrees with our actions.

How this all happened was not ideal, but given the state my mom was living in without help to the bathroom, shower, or even provided decent amounts of food; at the moment I didn’t see what choice I really had.
