0,1f0qybf,AITA for refusing to name our non-existent future child after our current dog?,"Hello
The title basically sums it up, it’s a little silly and we are both aware of it.

Today while driving my SO brought up baby names. (We are two non-binary lesbians and don’t have the parts to make this happen without a shit ton of planning, so no actually threat of a baby anytime soon btw) 

We were throwing baby names around and my SO brought up the name of our current dog, who is 12 years old.

There’s nothing wrong with the name per say, but I just feel like it’s weird to name a child after a dog? Seems mean to me somehow. My partner asked for a middle name maybe and I said no way.
I know that the dog is super super important to my partner (the fur baby has been with my partner since she was a baby, my partner rescued her way before we got together 2 years ago) and I think it would be nice to memorialize her importance in my partners life, but a baby name seems odd to me.
Idk if I’m over thinking it but I think if future imaginary child found out it could be seen as mean or something they wouldn’t like.

EDIT: due to questions, the name is Fern :)

1,1f0m80g,AITA for telling my mom I don’t like spending time alone with her? ,"My(29f) mom(64f) is very conservative/Christian and has a history of bringing up controversial topics and refusing to let it go when asked. She’s done this multiple times over the years with different topics (politics, religion, lgbt issues, etc) and will not drop it how no matter how much I beg her to. 

A couple of weeks ago, she took me out for lunch and then came over to my house to hang out for a while. She brought up the topic of my nephew(18m) who is trans. I know that she does not approve of him being trans and it caused a big uproar last year leading up to my wedding where my nephew was in the bridal party(I asked him before he came out). I thought I was starting to make some progress with her. I tried to explain that he is an adult and I don’t feel like it’s my place to say what he can and can’t do with his life/body and I’m just going to love him because he’s my nephew. However, she wasn’t buying this and doubled down by bringing up two of my other close friends and bridesmaids who are lesbian and bisexual. She said that by not condemning them and allowing them to “live in sin” that they’re more important to me than God’s laws. I said that no, I’m following God’s law of loving others because I feel that it’s important to be like Jesus and to love everyone regardless of where they are in life because it isn’t my business to judge them. This started to escalate and we were both yelling when I finally said “this is why I don’t like hanging out with you alone!” She stormed out and hasn’t spoken to me since.

I don’t feel like I’m in the wrong since, even though it wasn’t the nicest way to say it, it was something that needed to be said. My husband(36m) is on my side and now understands why I don’t often spend time alone with her. She generally holds it together in a group but not when she has me 1-on-1 but now his eyes are opened to how she can be. 
It seems like my dad(70m) doesn’t feel the same, which is probably the hardest for me since he doesn’t usually let stuff with my mom come between us but he hasn’t talked to me either. 

I know what I said was unkind but I can’t handle being backed into corners like this all the time…. So, was I the asshole for telling her that her actions make me not want to spend time with her alone anymore?
