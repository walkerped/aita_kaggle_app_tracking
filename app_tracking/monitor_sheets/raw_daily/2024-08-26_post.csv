0,1f1gg8v,AITA for dissociating during “nip talk”,"I (21M) have been enjoying my current place of employment. I love my job so so much until Jan..
 

Jan (48F) start a couple months ago as a new manager and has been a little less than what I expected. My team is small in number but are essentially PA's for other team members and I assist 4 managers and the other lady assists 3 managers and Jan is the boss of us. Right out of the gate Jan scheduled weekly meetings to discuss our workload, which I don't have an issue with, it's a great idea however it is a wast of 45 minutes.
 

Most of these meetings consist of going round the table (there's literally two of us) and asking how our workload is, which is usually fine, and if there's any issues (lots but I'm too scared to say anything). That generally takes 5 minutes... Keep in mind the meeting is 45 minutes long. There has been a total of 6 meetings, each of which have felt kinda inappropriate and I'll list them below. 
 

Meeting 1: Jan went up north for a party and got so drunk she puked on her feet driving home. 
 

Meeting 2: Jan expressed how much she hated people who took a day off whenever they got enough sick leave to do so, which honestly left me feeling weird because I myself struggle with mental health and need a day off and find myself waiting to have enough leave to do so.
 

Meeting 3: Jan was constipated and spent 5 hours straight on the toilet. I... I'm not really sure about that.
 

Meeting 4: Jan expressed how being a girl is so hard, which I know well about as I am a closeted trans man so live as a girl.
 

Meeting 5: The meeting of hell. Jan and my other coworker (50F) spoke about how good I have it working nowadays. I hateee this argument especially when it involves their argument of ""At least you don't get yelled at by managers"". Different generations have different struggles but I worked a fast food job for 5 years and was yelled at constantly by customers and managers and I was a child at the time so... I also had KFC Chicken thrown at me multiple times and boiling gravy but that's another story. 40 minutes of ""you have it so good"" is awful no matter the circumstance.
 

Meeting 6: Mother of all NIPS. This meeting was insane. For 40 minutes I was tortured with detailed discussion of Jan's nips and how they were sore and chaffed and she wished she didn't have to wear a bra at work. I totally get it. But at this point I started to dissociate, absolutely not wanting to participate in this uncomfortable conversation. Something about not being able to see her nips when she sits on the toilet and how her boobs are saggy... then my name was called. ""Why are you glaring at me?"" Apparently I'd been making a face while dissociating. The meeting was over.
 

I was called into Jan's office for a quick chat and was told that my behaviour was rude during the meeting and I should be participating in conversations more. 
 

TLDR: My boss spoke about her nips during a meeting and I was told it was rude to be uncomfortable and dissociate from the conversation.

Edit: The place I work for is a medium sized business without HR and the highest people I can talk to are pretty loyal to Jan as they were trained by her back in the day",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-08-26,"AITA for dissociating during “nip talk” I (21M) have been enjoying my current place of employment.
