0,1f1gg8v,AITA for dissociating during ‚Äúnip talk‚Äù,"I (21M) have been enjoying my current place of employment. I love my job so so much until Jan..
¬†

Jan (48F) start a couple months ago as a new manager and has been a little less than what I expected. My team is small in number but are essentially PA's for other team members and I assist 4 managers and the other lady assists 3 managers and Jan is the boss of us. Right out of the gate Jan scheduled weekly meetings to discuss our workload, which I don't have an issue with, it's a great idea however it is a wast of 45 minutes.
¬†

Most of these meetings consist of going round the table (there's literally two of us) and asking how our workload is, which is usually fine, and if there's any issues (lots but I'm too scared to say anything). That generally takes 5 minutes... Keep in mind the meeting is 45 minutes long. There has been a total of 6 meetings, each of which have felt kinda inappropriate and I'll list them below.¬†
¬†

Meeting 1: Jan went up north for a party and got so drunk she puked on her feet driving home.¬†
¬†

Meeting 2: Jan expressed how much she hated people who took a day off whenever they got enough sick leave to do so, which honestly left me feeling weird because I myself struggle with mental health and need a day off and find myself waiting to have enough leave to do so.
¬†

Meeting 3: Jan was constipated and spent 5 hours straight on the toilet. I... I'm not really sure about that.
¬†

Meeting 4: Jan expressed how being a girl is so hard, which I know well about as I am a closeted trans man so live as a girl.
¬†

Meeting 5: The meeting of hell. Jan and my other coworker (50F) spoke about how good I have it working nowadays. I hateee this argument especially when it involves their argument of ""At least you don't get yelled at by managers"". Different generations have different struggles but I worked a fast food job for 5 years and was yelled at constantly by customers and managers and I was a child at the time so... I also had KFC Chicken thrown at me multiple times and boiling gravy but that's another story. 40 minutes of ""you have it so good"" is awful no matter the circumstance.
¬†

Meeting 6: Mother of all NIPS. This meeting was insane. For 40 minutes I was tortured with detailed discussion of Jan's nips and how they were sore and chaffed and she wished she didn't have to wear a bra at work. I totally get it. But at this point I started to dissociate, absolutely not wanting to participate in this uncomfortable conversation. Something about not being able to see her nips when she sits on the toilet and how her boobs are saggy... then my name was called. ""Why are you glaring at me?"" Apparently I'd been making a face while dissociating. The meeting was over.
¬†

I was called into Jan's office for a quick chat and was told that my behaviour was rude during the meeting and I should be participating in conversations more.¬†
¬†

TLDR: My boss spoke about her nips during a meeting and I was told it was rude to be uncomfortable and dissociate from the conversation.

1,1f22zrg,AITA for getting frustrated with having to repeat myself on a daily basis multiple times ,"29F I live at home with my mum 58F because I'm chronically ill. Every day I have to say most of my sentences at least twice sometimes up to 5 times, this happens multiple times a day. It's become habit that I hold up fingers displaying how many times I've had to say something before I'm listened to. Meanwhile whenever my mum wants to say anything to me I'm expected to listen first time around. Sometimes I'll purposely do what she does and act like I haven't heard her but that usually results in her going into a mood so I don't do it often just when it's been a particularly repetitive day.

She doesn't listen to me so often I've just got used to repeating what I say in the exact same inflection when I don't get a response. Sometimes this leads to her proclaiming she heard me the first time which puts her in a mood and she acts like I'm shouting at her for not doing something quickly but I don't know when she's heard me vs not and given the not happens more often I just go with the most likely option.

Anyway she's often the only person I talk to irl because friends and family sorta dropped me when I got sick so it's really frustrating that the one person I talk to makes me say the same thing over and over again. Sometimes I'll be in the middle of a conversation and she'll walk out the room to do something else and I have to wait until she comes back to finish the conversation which I refer to as ""standby mode"" where I just have to wait for up to an hour, sometimes just to finish a sentence or thought.

I brought this up to her that she could listen better so I don't have to repeat myself so often all day everyday and she just blew up saying ""well I'm a bad person then"" when literally at most all I was saying was she's a bad listener but I shouldn't be surprised because any slight criticism it's either the silent storm out or the ""I'm such a bad person routine."" It stresses me out and the repetitiveness at home is only compressed by the amount of times I have to repeat myself with doctors about my condition. When I'm at home I would just like it if I didn't have to say nearly every sentence twice.

2,1f22z8f,AITA for not congratulating my friend on his engagement?,"I have a friend we will call him Bob.  Bob has a girlfriend named Mary.  Last night, I saw on IG Bob and Mary got engaged.  Last I heard they were broken up.  I am not even exaggerating they have probably broken up once a month since December.  Every time they do break up Mary comes running to me for emotional support.  I‚Äôve never actually met Mary as I live in a different country as her and Bob.  

I really liked Bob and Mary together at first.  In the 7 years I‚Äôve known Bob she was the first girl he told me about.  But it came very obvious after the second break up that they both have different needs.  Mary is very emotional and suffers with a lot of health issues where Bob rarely shows emotion and is very straight to the point.  She had told me at the end of the last month they had broken up and Bob had moved everything out of the house.  And last time I talked to Bob (a week ago) they were still broken up.  Now I‚Äôm finding out they are engaged and I don‚Äôt even know what to say because I‚Äôm also not even talking to Mary currently.  Mary texted me about 2 weeks ago saying I should be careful Bob wasn‚Äôt a very good friend to me he had said some stuff about me.  I asked her what he had said and she kept saying it wasn‚Äôt her place to tell me and I started getting annoyed and saying why are you telling me this then? Don‚Äôt bring this up to me if you‚Äôre not going to back up what you are saying.

She wouldn‚Äôt elk me so I blocked her.  I ended up talking to Bob about it and we cleared the air and in the end it was nothing major it was basically a misunderstanding between him and I.   I unblocked Mary and apologized for freaking out but told her I didn‚Äôt appreciate her just messaging me that kind of stuff without backing it up and it felt like she was causing drama and I said we‚Äôre okay in my books but to never pull that stuff again I didn‚Äôt appreciate it.

We met back in 2021 so we‚Äôve known each other for a good while, we are also in a long-distance relationship, but onto the issue, me and him both play video games together and I play on laptop and he has a whole entire PC set up, and he has two monitors. The problem is we always FaceTime to play video games together but he‚Äôs always looking at the second monitor every time we‚Äôre supposed to play a game together. The game is not displayed on the second monitor just to be clear, it doesn‚Äôt only have to do with games he‚Äôs even answered his friends phone calls in the middle of our conversation just to talk with them not even asking me if it‚Äôs okay, even though he‚Äôs already been on the phone with them for hours, this is not just something that happens here and there it‚Äôs an every day thing for both things that I just explained.

 For the past two years I finally made it to my breaking point about it and I never really spoke up about it because I thought it would change but it turns out I was wrong, I will give some examples. We sometimes play Phasmophobia together and we were in the truck for 25 minutes and didn‚Äôt even play the game to go find the ghost because he wasn‚Äôt paying any attention to me at all because he was talking to his friends on the second monitor, another example we were building a 500 piece puzzle on a game and I did 78% of the puzzle because he wasn‚Äôt paying attention and I asked for help and he barely did anything, when he realized that I did 78% of the puzzle he was offended that I said ‚Äúwell you weren‚Äôt paying attention when I asked for help‚Äù another example we both play a grocery store simulator, which is a new kind of game on steam for multiplayer and if anybody has played it, knows it‚Äôs kind of hard to run by yourself we have a reasonable size store that takes a while to stock stuff. He didn‚Äôt help me for a whole entire hour of stocking shelves, I stock shelves for a whole entire hour by myself and I had over 25 trucks that I unloaded by myself as well and I feel that it‚Äôs not fair that I‚Äôm always the one doing all the work and we play games together. 

I also feel like it‚Äôs not fair when he says he wants to spend time with me and play games. He‚Äôs never actually spending the time with me when he‚Äôs only texting his friends or looking for something on the second monitor. every time we play games together, he either starts doing something randomly in his room, like looking at his figures or his swords that he has or texting his friends, and it‚Äôs an every day thing for the past two years. 

after I made it to my breaking point, which was yesterday I asked him why FaceTime me to play games if you aren‚Äôt really gonna play them with me and just look at the second monitor and all he said was sorry, and went back to doing it again. 

so AITA?

edit: we have met 4 times in person for the first time this year. I‚Äôve also had 2 other long distance relationships before him, and tbh im only 2 hours away from him and he chooses not to come see me even though he drives and my parents currently take me to see him.

So, when we started dating, I stopped doing all of those things. Yes I still drink, but she does too so its not a big deal. The hardest thing I found to quit was the vaping. It is very addicting and I find that it actually helped with alot of stressful situations in my life. I was able to quit cold turkey when we first started dating. Everything was completely fine up until about 4 months ago where she would constantly bring it up and accuse me of doing it and all that. It doesnt help that all my friends do it and I go out with them, but I am able to control myself and not do it.

I know why Mum said nothing-she was pissed.
I found these things out on a call with Nan last week, and I told Mum everything Nan had said about the dog-including the dog bowls.

Mum is really angry and texted C to find out. C didn‚Äôt reply but my Nan tried to call Mum.

I feel intense guilt for telling Mum-I feel like a tattletale. However, Mum is visiting in a month to Nan and I didn‚Äôt want her to blindsided by everything.
I acted to help both as I feel Nan wanting a new dog is selfish. She won‚Äôt be able to walk it, play it, care for it and when she does pass we will have to rehome the dog.
We feel she also wants the dog to have an excuse to not go into care.

So am I the ass for telling my mother about the dog?

Tl;dr I told my mother information that my Nan (Her mother) told me on a call about the intention on getting a dog, even though she‚Äôs medically and physically frail.

UPDATE: Nan is getting a dog, confirmed. C and Mum‚Äôs sister M (Who we despise. She‚Äôs a narcissist and money hungry. A good example of M is she opposed modifications to Nan‚Äôs bathroom that would make it safer for Nan (And more accessible.

What the hell.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-26,"AITA for telling my mother that Nan intends on getting a dog, even though she needs to go into care? So my Nan is 88 and lives on her own. Her physical condition has come that she needs people to come shower her, do her shopping, clean her house and more.
(She lives in another state.)
She‚Äôs had strokes, she needs a walker, she‚Äôs in heart failure and she has other ailments. Yet she‚Äôs adamant about not going into care, even though she‚Äôs not able to properly live alone without help anymore.

She wants another pet since her last dog was put to sleep but she‚Äôs in no condition to care for it AT ALL. Her friend C (Who is a bitch) bought Nan dog bowls for her birthday so she obviously has the intention there.

I wasn't super thrilled, as I was going to see most of the family individually before leaving, but my mom was adamant.

The worst is that she is incredibly condescending to my brother in front of us, and it makes everyone uncomfortable.

9,1f214ww,AITA for setting a boundary with a friend?,"I (23F) had a 4 year long friendship with a guy. I enjoyed our chats, discord calls, and sharing memes. He was kind and always respectful.

Most notably was how often he'd call me cute. This was where I felt like I needed to say something.

In my eyes, there is nothing wrong with setting a boundary. Even if it's a wrong assumption, it shouldn't change anything in the friendship. However he completely blew up at me. He called me an idiot, said how stupid I was to assume that he was a little interested in me. That I must be one of those basic b*tch white girls always looking for attention.

And I'm fine with that, nobody loves me any less because of it.  As you can probably guess from the title, we sometimes joke about the fact that I'm white. It is never anything I would consider to be offensive. One of them has me labeled as 'Edward Cullen' in her contacts because I'm so pale. I think it's hilarious. To give you an idea, some of the comments are like ""can't handle spicy food because you're white, vampire, can't handle sunlight, needs sunscreen every minute, colonizer."" that isn't everything, but it's harmless. I make fun of me being white too. And they are just playing around, it's what friends do. I have never felt like they are trying to be offensive.

Last night, I was upstairs doing some of my math homework. I leave my phone downstairs when I'm doing homework so I'm not tempted to look at it. Apparently, while I was doing my homework, my friends started a conversation in the group chat and some of those messages popped up when they were wondering where I was because I was the only person not responding lol. My mom noticed how much my phone was going off and checked it. After I finished my homework, my mom asked to talk to me, and she said ""there's nothing wrong with being white, don't listen to your friends.""

It's not a passion necessarily, but I've enjoyed a number manga since I first started reading and I like having physical copies of my favorite series for rereading. Anyway, I have a younger brother Alan (25M) and he has a girlfriend Emma (22F). Alan also likes manga, but got into it later than I did and only has partial collections of a couple series and full collections of maybe two series. He also generally reads less than me. 

Emma, however, is a bookworm. She was apparently one of those very smart gifted kids who was always reading instead of doing anything else, but she stopped reading for a few years for some reason, then started up again this year. Alan has been trying to get her into manga since she had a short anime phase in her teens and recommended her a series that I have all the volumes of. He let her read the first one while she was visiting our parents (this particular series is living on a bookshelf in Alan's room at our parent's place) and she loved it. Alan asked if he could give Emma the other volumes to take back to their shared apartment so she could keep reading the series. I said sure, as I trust them both to not lose or damage them.

That was a couple of months ago. Last week, Alan and Emma came to visit my wife and I and decided to bring the books and drop them off. Emma thanked me more than once for allowing her to borrow my set and we had some fun conversations about what she thought of the story and the art work. After they left, I took the manga into the shared office space I have with my wife and started placing the set on my bookshelf. As I was placing the individual volumes, I noticed that volume 7 had a wrinkle down the length of the spine. None of the other volumes had their spines broken or any other noticeable wear and tear, but the one broken spine made me a bit upset. I lent these under the condition that Emma wouldn't break or damage them, and she returned one of them with a visibly broken spine. It's also the second set I completed, so there's some sentimental value there. The first few volumes still have little color coded tabs in them from my phase of kind-of-annotating my manga.

12,1f20wyk,"AITA for Not Inviting My Friends Of 8 Years on My Birthday Trip After They Excluded Me from Hangouts Because I Was ""Too Busy""?","So, I (22M) just had my birthday last week and decided to treat myself to a week-long getaway in a beach house my grandma owns. It was something I‚Äôd been planning for a while, a peaceful break from the stress of university. I‚Äôm in my last year of university, and things have been hectic, i have 8 classes plus my thesis. So to say that over the past few months I‚Äôve been so buried in assignments and exams is a understatement, It came t√¥ a point that I had to turn down a lot of hangout invitations from my friends (a group of four people I've been close with since the first year of highschool, eight years ago), the problem is, they would always hangout in weekdays, when i had class, so I progressivly distanced myself from them even though we would still text. 

I only have two group of friend, them, and a six people group that i met in eight grade and also have been best friends since, but this group tends to schedule around everybodys free time, so we constantly hangout.

A few months ago, I noticed My highschool friends started hanging out without even asking me if I could join. I didn't think much of it at first, I mean, I was genuinely busy. But then they started posting on social media about their outings, even at weekends, when i allowed myself to take breaks, tagging each other, and not even bothering to mention it to me. I felt hurt, but I figured they assumed I was still too busy. When I asked one of them about it, they said they didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúbother‚Äù me since I was always studying and didn't had time for them. That stung, but I didn‚Äôt say anything.

Fast forward to my birthday. I really wanted to do something special for myself, so I asked my grandma if i could use her beach house since noone lived there. I asked my other group if they were free and they were, so I invited them, we went and I posted a picture of us on my story, captioned something like ‚Äúbirthday vibes with friends.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when the group chat blew up. They were asking why I didn‚Äôt invite them, initially playfully saying how we‚Äôve always celebrated birthdays together (which was true for some time, except lately we weren't even doing that, two of these friends had birthdays before mine and guess what, i wasn't invited). I Just said that i didn't knew If they were busy or not, and especially with all the stress I‚Äôve been under i didn't wanted to spend a lot of time making plans. But they were upset, saying it was selfish of me not to include them when they‚Äôve always been there for me.

Here‚Äôs where I might be the asshole: I told them that I didn‚Äôt feel included lately because they‚Äôve been hanging out without me, and that maybe they didn‚Äôt really care about spending time with me in the first place. They said I was being unfair, that I could‚Äôve made time if I really wanted to, and that they were just giving me space because they knew i was under stress.

Now, things are really tense between us, and I‚Äôm not sure if I overreacted or if they‚Äôre just being unreasonable.

So to say that over the past few months I‚Äôve been so buried in assignments and exams is a understatement, It came t√¥ a point that I had to turn down a lot of hangout invitations from my friends (a group of four people I've been close with since the first year of highschool, eight years ago), the problem is, they would always hangout in weekdays, when i had class, so I progressivly distanced myself from them even though we would still text. 

I only have two group of friend, them, and a six people group that i met in eight grade and also have been best friends since, but this group tends to schedule around everybodys free time, so we constantly hangout.

A few months ago, I noticed My highschool friends started hanging out without even asking me if I could join. I didn't think much of it at first, I mean, I was genuinely busy. But then they started posting on social media about their outings, even at weekends, when i allowed myself to take breaks, tagging each other, and not even bothering to mention it to me. I felt hurt, but I figured they assumed I was still too busy. When I asked one of them about it, they said they didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúbother‚Äù me since I was always studying and didn't had time for them. That stung, but I didn‚Äôt say anything.

Fast forward to my birthday. I really wanted to do something special for myself, so I asked my grandma if i could use her beach house since noone lived there. I asked my other group if they were free and they were, so I invited them, we went and I posted a picture of us on my story, captioned something like ‚Äúbirthday vibes with friends.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when the group chat blew up. They were asking why I didn‚Äôt invite them, initially playfully saying how we‚Äôve always celebrated birthdays together (which was true for some time, except lately we weren't even doing that, two of these friends had birthdays before mine and guess what, i wasn't invited). I Just said that i didn't knew If they were busy or not, and especially with all the stress I‚Äôve been under i didn't wanted to spend a lot of time making plans. But they were upset, saying it was selfish of me not to include them when they‚Äôve always been there for me.

Here‚Äôs where I might be the asshole: I told them that I didn‚Äôt feel included lately because they‚Äôve been hanging out without me, and that maybe they didn‚Äôt really care about spending time with me in the first place. They said I was being unfair, that I could‚Äôve made time if I really wanted to, and that they were just giving me space because they knew i was under stress.

Now, things are really tense between us, and I‚Äôm not sure if I overreacted or if they‚Äôre just being unreasonable. AITA for not inviting them on my birthday trip and calling them out for excluding me?",1.0,0.019376832991838455,0,0
13,1f20mig,AITA for backseat driving my roommate?,">EDIT: 

>Q: why do you ride with the roommate? 

>A: Whenever we go to the same place (we work next door to each other, going to the grocery store, etc) we switch off being the one to drive/take our car. But it sounds like I should just be the one to drive from now on.

My roommate's driving terrifies me.

He regularly will, while making a turn, wait until the very last possible second then abruptly jerk/saw the wheel, shaking the car around and coming way too close for comfort to hitting stuff.

He can't seem to stay within lines whether it's driving or parking, to the point where his parallel parking attempt left the car half in the street, as well as in 2 parking meter spots.

He refuses to hold the wheel at 9&3, or 10&2, instead opting for 1&6 or occasionally 1&Horn, leaving him completely unable to steer left more than about 1/4 turn without first shuffling his hands around.

He also either pretends not to, or genuinely cannot, see things directly in front of him. Last week it was the wall of the parking garage at 5mph, he just drove right into it, nobody was in danger. But a few weeks before that, it was 2 people on a motorcycle that he refused to let off the accelerator for even though we were already going 15 over. After I and another passenger screamed ""NO NO NO STOP"" for a few seconds he finally braked and narrowly avoided them, but we were close enough I could see right into the passenger's eyes and see how terrified they looked.

I realize it's usually rude to backseat drive, and I try not to do it, but when things like these happen, I feel like I have no choice. I feel like if I don't speak up people are going to get hurt, whether that's myself in the passenger seat or the innocent bystanders outside.

He usually tells me some reason like ""I can't see when it's dark outside!"" for the motorcycle couple or ""I don't know how to drive without doing that"", and my response is usually ""if you can't see/if you can't control the car, you shouldn't be driving"". Which, again, I know is usually considered rude, but it's my honest feeling.",Asshole,2024-08-26,"AITA for backseat driving my roommate? >EDIT:

16,1f206bz,AITA for making my son (16) pay for his own room?,"I'm a single mom of 5 (16M, 14M, 10M, 9F, 7M) renting a 3-bedroom house.

Up until 2 months ago the 2 eldest boys shared a room, the 3 youngest shared, and I had the smallest room. 

For the last few years my eldest complained non-stop about having to share a room with his little brother. Most of his friends‚Äô parents are wealthy so he's constantly comparing our situation to theirs. 

He started working when he was 14 (a few hours a week) for a little extra money, now at 16 he works a lot (more than I would like) and this summer he has been working basically fill-time. He's not too bad with his money and actually saves some of it, but the rest goes to video games, clothes/shoes, and junk food. 

2 months ago, my son and I were discussing his distaste for sharing a room with his brother and he said he'd drop out of school now if it meant he could move out into his own space. I told him I had looked at 4-bedroom rentals in our area, but they were just too expensive. He asked if he could pay the difference if we did move. I told him no because during the school year all his money would be going to rent not his savings and his spending money. That obviously wouldn't sit right with me.

However, we did come up with a compromise. For $50 a month he could have my bedroom and my 10-year-old could move in with 14-year-old and I would sleep in our living room (our couch is already a pull-out). This was 2 months ago, and we already made the switch, and everybody is happy with the new set up. 

All the money my son is paying me is going straight into my Christmas savings and then after Christmas will go into a summer trip savings. 

I recently told some of my friends what I was doing and they're against it. They think I'm wrong for taking any amount of money from my kids and a couple of them said I should have just given him the room without making him pay for it. They make some good points, and I don't totally disagree, and it makes me feel like an asshole.

My 14-year-old son is also unhappy about the arrangement, he thinks its unfair older brother is getting his own room and that middle brother should have stayed in his old room.

20,1f1z102,WIBTA if I sign out and change the password of my Epic account so my friend can't play anymore?,"I've been close friends with someone, let‚Äôs call him Sam, for 9 years. Earlier this year, Sam mentioned he wanted to play games but didn‚Äôt want to spend. Since I have few games on my Epic account and we‚Äôre close, I let him borrow my account.

Here‚Äôs the situation: whenever our friends plan a trip, Sam either doesn‚Äôt respond in our group chat or refuses to go. This has been happening for about two years. Last year, we planned a camping trip, which coincided with my birthday, and invited Sam, but he declined. Since we were chatting a lot about the trip, we created a separate group chat so he wouldn‚Äôt feel left out. Although this group chat was meant only for the camping trip, we ended up using it whenever Sam refused to join our plans.

In April, one of our friends mentioned a limited discount on plane tickets in the group chat that didn‚Äôt include Sam. She asked if we wanted to go to the beach, and we quickly booked our flights since the slots were limited. We forgot to invite Sam initially, but one friend suggested inviting him later, even though it wouldn‚Äôt be at the discounted price. Knowing Sam‚Äôs situation‚Äîhe was unemployed and likely to prioritize necessities over leisure‚ÄîI agreed, thinking he might decline. I reminded our friends to invite him anyway, but two months passed, and we forgot. We went on the beach trip, and in hindsight, we were somewhat relieved that Sam didn‚Äôt join us because the prices were high, and the activities, though fun, were exhausting. Sam isn‚Äôt into outdoor activities and prefers to chill.

When we returned, we posted some photos on Instagram. I noticed Sam liked a friend‚Äôs previous trip but not our beach photos. I didn‚Äôt think much of it. A few days later, I messaged him to ask how he was doing, but he didn‚Äôt reply or see my messages. I wanted to explain why we hadn‚Äôt invited him, but he continued to ignore me. I kept sending him memes and reels, but he never responded or viewed my IG stories. I started to worry that he was cutting ties with me, as he‚Äôs the type to easily cut people off. I understand he might be hurt that we didn‚Äôt invite him, and I feel at fault for forgetting.

After two weeks of being ignored, Sam suddenly messaged me in our Disney+ group chat, asking for a code. To give you some context, I own the Disney account, which he and his family use, and we split the bill. I wasn‚Äôt sure how to respond after being ignored, but I gave him the code since he pays his share. After that, he still didn‚Äôt talk to me.

I‚Äôm starting to feel less concerned about him, so I‚Äôm considering signing out my Epic account from all devices and changing the password so he can‚Äôt play the free games anymore.

WIBTA if I sign out and change the password?

",Asshole,2024-08-26,"WIBTA if I sign out and change the password of my Epic account so my friend can't play anymore? I've been close friends with someone, let‚Äôs call him Sam, for 9 years. Earlier this year, Sam mentioned he wanted to play games but didn‚Äôt want to spend. Since I have few games on my Epic account and we‚Äôre close, I let him borrow my account.

Here‚Äôs the situation: whenever our friends plan a trip, Sam either doesn‚Äôt respond in our group chat or refuses to go. This has been happening for about two years. Last year, we planned a camping trip, which coincided with my birthday, and invited Sam, but he declined. Since we were chatting a lot about the trip, we created a separate group chat so he wouldn‚Äôt feel left out. Although this group chat was meant only for the camping trip, we ended up using it whenever Sam refused to join our plans.

In April, one of our friends mentioned a limited discount on plane tickets in the group chat that didn‚Äôt include Sam. She asked if we wanted to go to the beach, and we quickly booked our flights since the slots were limited. We forgot to invite Sam initially, but one friend suggested inviting him later, even though it wouldn‚Äôt be at the discounted price. Knowing Sam‚Äôs situation‚Äîhe was unemployed and likely to prioritize necessities over leisure‚ÄîI agreed, thinking he might decline. I reminded our friends to invite him anyway, but two months passed, and we forgot. We went on the beach trip, and in hindsight, we were somewhat relieved that Sam didn‚Äôt join us because the prices were high, and the activities, though fun, were exhausting. Sam isn‚Äôt into outdoor activities and prefers to chill.

When we returned, we posted some photos on Instagram. I noticed Sam liked a friend‚Äôs previous trip but not our beach photos. I didn‚Äôt think much of it. A few days later, I messaged him to ask how he was doing, but he didn‚Äôt reply or see my messages. I wanted to explain why we hadn‚Äôt invited him, but he continued to ignore me. I kept sending him memes and reels, but he never responded or viewed my IG stories. I started to worry that he was cutting ties with me, as he‚Äôs the type to easily cut people off. I understand he might be hurt that we didn‚Äôt invite him, and I feel at fault for forgetting.

After two weeks of being ignored, Sam suddenly messaged me in our Disney+ group chat, asking for a code. To give you some context, I own the Disney account, which he and his family use, and we split the bill. I wasn‚Äôt sure how to respond after being ignored, but I gave him the code since he pays his share. After that, he still didn‚Äôt talk to me.

Okay, that was a whammy of a title, and you're probably incredibly confused, let me explain.

Me and my Mom currently live at her best friend, (of 10 years)'s house, she has a large property and has a smaller house on it (her adult daughter currently lives there with her son, she's moving out with her fiance soon), which we're due to move into before the end of Autumn. We've been living here for about two months.

I should probably clarify, I'm going to refer to her best friend as bf, which is not to be confused with boyfriend.

Last night, me, my mom and bf were sitting on the deck back, watching the sunset, she was setting up a spotify family plan to add us to it, and she emailed me the invite to the plan. It didn't go through and I asked her to re-send it, simple, right? 

No.

She snatches my phone from my hand and looks in my inbox, my trash folder, my junk folder (not sure the difference) and my spam folder. Right at the top of the spam folder is a spam email from a porn site.

She says, out loud ""Hey, (mom's name), you should do something about this."" and proceeds to read it out, iirc it was a milf dating site, and the email starts off with ""Hey naughty mister"". I'm obviously embarassed as fuck, and I tell her that it's not mine and that it's spam, hence why it's in the CLEARLY labelled spam folder. She and my mom claim to believe me, and then they lecture me for over 45 minutes about internet safety.

I'm really pissed off, as this is an invasion of privacy and blatant disrespect. My mother doesn't even go through my phone, so why does her best friend have the right to, I don't know.

Might I add, bf's daughter (who lives in our soon-to-be house), gave me her old iPhone, but my mom pays for it if that adds any additional context or clarity needed.

28,1f1x5dz,WIBTA if I left a four star review on my Mercari order?,"This is EXTREMELY unserious but I worry. I bought a funko pop on Mercari of Korra from The Legend of Korra. It was cheap, less than 20 dollars including shipment and other fees. 

The problem is that the shipper couldn't find the funko pop I paid for and offered to send me another one. It is literally the exact same funko pop but it is like special edition (?) and Korra's clothing is metallic. The number on the box is 761 if you interested in seeing the difference. It says it's a warehouse exclusive. 

Anyways, I am mildly upset that the seller couldn't find the funko pop because it is the one I wanted. The other one is the exact same with only slight differences. So would I be the asshole if I knocked them down one star? I said I would give them a good rating, and four stars is good but I feel bad. It's not even the fact that it's a different funko pop it's just that they couldn't find the one I wanted, does that make sense? It's the fact that they lost it and failed to check if they had it before I paid, you know?

29,1f1x3sj,WIBTA if I refuse to let wedding guests stay at my apartment?,"I (27M) am going to attend the wedding of my mother and soon to be stepfather. The wedding will be next year (Spring 2025) and everything is being planned out by them. Some things have been discussed between close family members and maid of honor, best man etc.

While I myself will most likely not have a big role in the wedding (might walk my mom down the aisle and be the driver as I will be one of the only sober ones there), one thing that I can help with is my apartment. My apartment is good/big enough to host some guests that will be coming for the wedding from further away. This is mainly so we don't have to search out a lot of hotels or AirBnB.

Here comes the issue though, where I am not sure if I would be the asshole:

The first idea for a guest to stay over was to have my sister (Sarah, fake name) and her 2 kids be over at my apartment for that weekend, which would have been fine. While I am not the biggest kids person, I think it would be manageable for a weekend and they are my niece and nephew anyway.

But my sister Sarah and my mother had a fallout a while back (again) and haven't communicated much since. Sarah is still invited but never responded to the invite card, so the general assumption is she and the kids will not attend. Sadly the only interaction they had was about the funeral of our grandmother, who died 3 months ago. Sarah wanted to attend but ""suddenly her son was sick and she couldn't find anyone to take care of him to be able to attend"" (he is 7yo). Personally I thought it as an excuse not to see my mother.

At the funeral we met my moms cousins, who are as well my former godmothers. They too are invited to the wedding While they connected after not seeing each other in a while the discussion came later up that if Sarah wouldn't be attending the wedding maybe instead of her, my former godmothers could stay at my place.

I don't feel quite comfortable with them staying over at my place. I don't know them anymore, as the last time I saw them before the funeral was over 13 years ago as my family drifted apart. At the same time I don't like sharing my own space with other people. The only people who I ever invited to my place were my ex, my sister and my two best friends. It's partially as well because I am not the most cleanly/orderly person and my mom expects from me to have the ""best looking apartment"" for that occasion. Even though they would just be staying there most likely to sleep.

Would I be the asshole to say no to specific guests staying at my apartment for the wedding?

I wouldn't say that I'm a walking stereotype, but I do exhibit a lot of 'autistic behaviours'. I have been with my partner (F20) for about 2 years now, and we moved in together a few months ago. She has been aware of my autism for a majority of the time we have been dating, and has always been completely okay with it. She'd help me to navigate social situations (a particular hatred of mine), support me during times of being overwhelmed etc, just generally being a total sweetheart. I have always let her know how much I appreciate it, and she always promised me that it was no trouble at all. Fast forwards to a few months ago. We're moving in! Just a little apartment, but I was so excited to continue this part of our lives together. The first out of the ordinary thing I noticed was her telling me how annoying she finds it when I repeat certain phrases, (a habit I've had for as far back as I can remember). I understand that these things can be irritating, so despite being a little hurt, I pushed it to the back of my mind. She has since thrown out everything I owned that related to my main interest, begun to call me slurs for doing things that I have done around her for years, saying 'ignore him, he doesn't understand much' when I'm speaking to someone, just doing and saying really hurtful things ALL THE TIME. I was losing my mind living with her, so I confronted her. She said it's because I've 'started acting like more of a retard than ever' since we moved in together. I am hurt, and so confused. I'm staying with a friend right now, purely because I cannot stay with my gf any longer. I need to know if her reaction is normal & I'm the asshole in this situation.

I can‚Äôt work, cook, drive, and even getting dressed is extremely difficult. since my husband works during the day, I‚Äôve been spending the day for the past couple weeks at my sister‚Äòs, who is a stay at home mom. Now, my husband‚Äòs friend lives in a different town (he moved a couple years ago and my husband knew him since high school), and is about a 3.5 hour drive away. He would have to leave early in the morning and come back late at night. The birthday party took place on Saturday, which is my sister‚Äôs busiest day as she has to take her kids to their various activities and run errands, so she‚Äôd basically be out of the house the entire day. I knew there was no way she could take care of me, so I told my husband he needed to miss the party. 

Again, I know the first birthday is a big deal, but I wouldn‚Äôt be able to take care of myself or do anything for the entire day. I said he could always visit them after I got better, it‚Äôs not like the baby‚Äôs going anywhere. A birthday party is just a superficial event and is by no means absolutely necessary. 

He was pretty upset about this, and I overheard his conversation with his friend, and he was pretty pissed about it too. The thing is his friend had never broken a bone before, so he had no idea how difficult it was just to get through the day. I think my husband is holding a grudge now. He doesn‚Äôt say anything, but I can see that he hasn‚Äôt let this go. I told my sister about it afterward and she thinks what I did was awful, but I really don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs such a huge deal? idk maybe it‚Äòs because I don‚Äôt have kids but I don‚Äôt see why missing a birthday party is such a terrible thing, especially given the circumstances.

37,1f1vcdu,AITA for calling out narcissistic behavior on family text threads? ,"I really do think I'm TA, but would like others' opinions. I don't mind advice either. Throwaway for reasons.

I (46) am part of a pretty small family, divorced parents, one sibling who has kids. Father remarried, mother did not. We're all across the country with varied social media so texting seems to be the way.

Relevant: there are quite a few mental health issues in my family, as well as some a variety of unhealthy behaviors such as controlling behaviors, criticism without support or positive feedback, one way conversations, ignoring accomplishments etc. Our biological parents, like many boomers, neglected my sibling and me. We were both used as emotional crutches, my sibling more than me. I have mostly recognized that this family is what I've got, and have been trying not to react to or offer feedback about hurtful behaviors in an effort to maintain some sort of relationship.

Over the last few years, I have been in therapy and have realized this approach is not working for me. I've tried a variety of approaches, none of which have had positive results and seem to be leading to me being ostracized. Some examples:

- Sibling sends a photo of their daughter, who got a haircut she wasn't sure of. Father's wife responds ""she just needs to SMILE"" and I respond ""Nope! We're not telling women what to do with their bodies""

- Mother sends a list of demands in the same week as sibling dropped off child at college for freshman year, without acknowledging the week the emotional week sibling had. I responded to the text with the laughter reaction (not emoji). When mother expressed offense, I explained ""it's funny because sibling just had major milestone and you're making it about you""

These are petty examples but seem to have resulted in being left out of important communications, such as coordination for parents' surgery and travel. When I talk or text with family members individually, I tend to be the one to initiate and am a supportive and empathetic person. I do tend to respond to boundary crossing with sarcasm and that probably makes me the asshole.",Asshole,2024-08-26,"AITA for calling out narcissistic behavior on family text threads?

39,1f1v8i6,AITA For not letting my friend decorate my room?,"Hello!

So long story short, me, my girlfriend, and another friend are all rooming together. We have another friend from college who doesn't live with us, but comes here frequently.

Friend Roommate and College Friend both have to go back to college while me and my girlfriend are done, so our college friend had asked if she could stay here during the school year. She said she would pay some rent, clean, and even cook for us. We don't mind if she stays at all, so we said yes.

I haven't been in my room as often since I usually just sleep in my girlfriends room, so back when our friends would stay over, they usually just stayed in mine, which was no biggie. 

It hadn't been a problem till lately, where she's started to ask for things. At one point we were all talking and she asked why I just don't move all my stuff into my girlfriends room. I had to reiterate first that it was MY room, my name is on the lease and I pay for it, and secondly I have way too much stuff. After that it's just been nonstop.

School started today and all week she's just been asking if she can do this or do that. She asked me if she could put posters up and I said I wasn't comfortable with that, it's my space I don't want any changes not done by me. She keeps saying she understands but still won't take no for an answer. I feel like maybe I'm not being clear enough and that's my problem which is why I'm worried, but I feel like just saying no should be enough and I don't want to start anything.

Even today we talked and she said she wanted to help me clean but then reverted it back to how she wants to find stuff we both like. I told her I don't mind cleaning up my room since it's a mess and I do want it to be a coherent aesthetic, but for me to like. 

She kept reiterating to me that she likes to live in comfort and an aesthetic and that's why she wanted to bring some stuff from home. And like I said, I don't mind if she changes the bed sheets or brings a lamp. That's fine and doesn't change too much. But posters and decorations and anything larger I just don't feel comfortable with. It doesn't help that I have a cat and most of his stuff is in there and her stuff is starting to block his. 

She also kept telling me that she only keeps doing this because she's autistic and can't live in a space that's not comfortable or familiar to her. Which number one I have autism too and number two this isn't her space? It's my room and she's not on the lease so I feel like she has no reason to try and impede.

I don't want to upset her but I feel like she keeps brushing over my no's and it feels like I'm being kicked out of my own room. But i'm not sure if maybe I'm taking it a step too far and getting frustrated for no reason. Am I the asshole?

She stole toys from us, as children; stole a pair of gold earrings from my aunt, stole money from the savings of my uncle (yes, her own father and he knows about this) she manipulates her father into thinking im a monster who just stares bad at her, and my uncle, instaed of talking to me, goes to my mom and scolds her, as if im not an adult now so... 

should i apologise? AITA? is really everything i said that bad compared to what she did?",0.0,0.7983598113059998,1,0
44,1f1tr2a,AITA for hanging out with my co-worker?,"English isn't not my mother tongue, so sorry in advance for my mistakes.
I'm (26F) a teacher. I also have a hard time making friends because I'm an introvert. 
I've been working in that school for three years for now and I've got some acquaintances (not friends though). Recently I've started spending more time with other teachers at work. It's a friend group: one female and 3 males. Every single one of them either married or has a significant other. And I'm not. 
I spend more time with two in this group: female (let's call her Hayley) and male (let's call him Nick). The reason is that (unlike the other two guys) all three of us are the class teachers thus we have same issues and same tasks. We're also kind of new to that stuff (being a class teacher) so we try to help each other.
Now to the problem.
Couple days ago Hayley had to leave earlier than usually so me and Nick were dealing with papers and books by ourselves. He was going to take some days off before the beginning of the new school year and I found out that he had those days because he's taken part in one event. So have I. That was how I found out that I also had 2 days off. It started getting a bit weird when we both wrote our application. Vice principal said that it was kind of weird that we took days of on the same days, almost suspicious. (WTF?)
I left and he stayed because the principle wanted to talk to him about something. On my way home I came across him and asked what the principal wanted. He said that he's been told not to hang out together (sorta inappropriate) WTF?????
Details that might (?) be important:
1) our friendly relationship has never had a bad influence on our work. For what it woth, it has a good influence (because we usually help each we do things faster).
2) this principle is kind of new, he's been working in our school for a year.
3) no contact with Nick outside the work (except once I played volleyball with co-workers including Nick like a year ago).
4) no romantic feelings here, he's got a wife and a child.
So AITA for hanging out with my co-worker?

Recently, my friend group (which Sarah is in) decided to go to a local fair. Sarah had mentioned prior that she might want to do a margarita girls night after. However, my sister Sally (25f) was staying with me that night because she was traveling through, which happens moderately often. Because of this, I told Sarah that margarita night was a hesitant no, as I didn‚Äôt want to ditch my sister. At the fair later, Sarah changed the girls night to going to random house party instead, so I changed my hesitant no to a definite one. This is where the story starts. 

I am a senior in my university, but I transferred from community college for my sophomore year and it was not a good experience.

I talked Rachel (21f), the only other senior in my friend group, who also transferred and is a senior, about how upset I was. she agreed and related. I asked my Sally if she cared if i went, and since Sally said she didn‚Äôt, Rachel and i decided to go.

I responded with a paragraph explaining how hurt I was that there was an organized senior event I knew nothing about, and that I just really wanted to participate and feel like I belonged- especially because I would not get the chance to do senior things again. Sarah responded that she didn‚Äôt understand where i was coming from and has since left my second attempt at explaining on read. 

However, I found out yesterday that Rachel never texted Sarah that we had decided to go to the senior bar crawl, which Rachel had said she was going to do.

Joey has also never reached out to ask after Poppy, it‚Äôs always been a conversation I start and he never seems particularly interested. Because of this I have been contacting X less over time.

Recently I was looking through my photos of Poppy and found the pictures of her cage at Joey's house. Her bedding was so thin on the ground that it would've been impossible for her to dig (which is very important for a hamster's health). The bedding was also so old and dirty that it had turned from white to grey and beige. At the time these photos were taken I wasn‚Äôt paying much attention and knew next to nothing about hamsters so it didn‚Äôt ring any bells.

Poppy was also a lot less sociable when Joey first left, initially she was prone to teeth gnashing, squeaking, hiding a lot and found being picked up distressing. Nowadays she is still quite antisocial, but can be handle being carried and out of her cage for much longer stints. Until I looked back at her cage at Joey‚Äôs I thought it was because I was new to her and hamsters notoriously hate moving, but now I‚Äôm not as sure.

I am taking Poppy to a vet and will be getting their opinion as far as what is best for her health as she isn‚Äôt getting any younger, but I am very reluctant to hand her over to Joey when he returns in a couple of months. Admittedly, I really love her and would hate to see her go, but I'm not so weird that I would refuse to give her back if I was sure she'd be ok.

55,1f1rek0,AITA for not calling my dad back?,"I (34f) have a complicated family history that resulted in the need to cut off my entire immediate family in the past three years.

There's a good number of somewhat more distant family that I still love and care for. But, my immediate family has so little regard for boundaries that if I opened that door even a crack, I would be put through so much emotional turmoil that it could potentially undo years of therapy. 

My grandfather (95) passed away close to two weeks ago. I found out through an Instagram post of a distant cousin who I keep up with (just daily life things, nothing about anyone else). I wasn't that close to my grandpa. I honesty dont know much about his life. He only spent time with the male family members.

I did finally get a voicemail from my dad (69) the day after I found out. It was his dad who passed (relevant?).

There's wasn't much to the message. My dad passed on the news. He seemed tired and I could tell from his voice he didn't expect me to reach out. Both of his parents are now gone.

I honestly don't want to. I don't want to go to the funeral and make everyone awkward or make it about me. I've mentally prepared for this for years. I will visit his grave later on. I don't want to reach out and give hope that reconciliation is possible.

But I am struggling with the guilt because I am sorry his dad passed away. I am upset my grandpa died. I don't want people to have a horrible impression of me, that I don't care. I do, but I finally found peace away from them.

The problem started a few weeks ago; we were already at the bar. When Marie (29F) Anthony new GF went to take a second or third round, I asked her to take me a coke, and she asked for my credit card.¬†  


Before I could say anything, Anthony just said, ""Come on, babe, I explained to you how it works. Don't make a scene."" She just replied, ""Urgh"" walked to the bar, and came back with just her drink. I just looked at Anthony, rolled my eyes, ordered myself a coke, and moved on.

Later that night, Laura came to ask for my car keys and not to come. All the girls are going together.

She created such a scene that we were all kicked out of the bar. 

  
While walking back to my car, Marie kept her act, screaming insults and other names to me while fake crying¬†

I won't leave you here to make sure you go home safe only out of respect for your BF, but after that, you can find your own way to and from the club and bar."" After that, we all got to the car, and the ride home was very quiet...

Fast Forward to this weekend. In the group chat, we are planning a night out ; the first one since the incident. And Marie (who joined the group chat) asked for my address and gave me hers, so I could drive her home.  
I just reminded her of what happened a few weeks ago, that I was serious, that I wouldn't drive her home, and that I don't want her at my place at the moment.

She called me petty and an Assh\*le before leaving the chat group. And now the friend group is divided. Anthony said, ""I'm staying out of it"" while Julie and Laura don't agree if Marie is right or not ...

62,1f1q5qe,AITA for telling my sister's fianc√© he should stop her from using his money to pay for her friends?,"My sister pretty much had zero of her own friends until last year. She'd lost touch with her old school and university friends but they all came out of the woodwork after she got engaged to her fianc√© and started portraying a certain lifestyle online. I think my sister is just so grateful to have her old friends back that she doesn't realise most of them only reconnected with her because they want the lifestyle she has.

Her fianc√© has given her free access to his money and my sister has been using it to treat everyone around, including her so called friends. I'm worried that they're just using her and I've tried talking to my sister about dialling back how much she pays for things but she finds it hard to say no when people ask her for things so it hasn't worked as her friends aren't shy about asking.

My husband is the person who introduced my sister to her fianc√© so we know him well which is why I felt comfortable bringing the situation up to him. I suggested he should stop her from using his money to pay for her friends and he said he would speak to my sister because he agrees that most of the friends are using her.

He hasn't cut her off or anything but he's keeping an eye on what she's spending money on now which he wasn't doing before. My sister isn't dumb so she knows it's because I spoke to him so she's no longer speaking to me even though I was just trying to look out for her best interest.

63,1f1q5dl,AITA for telling me my mom to stop asking to run the family errands? ,"I (31M) recently told my Mom who lives overseas to stop asking me for every little thing our family needs. 

Some of my family lives in my area, most of it lives overseas. Whenever somebody needs something, my mother always asks me (even if it has nothing to do with me) because I'm the most functional one. Me and my wife recently had a baby and our time and energy are essentially non-existent. On top of that, I work full-time. Whenever I say ""no"", she tries to guilt trip me. I on the other hand never ask anything from anyone in my family.

Lately she asked me to call the police on behalf of my brother who was vacationing in China to report a friend of his who parked my brother's car in a restricted area. I told her my brother should call himself and she said it was rude of me because long distance calls are expensive. I initially said no, but she kept telling me to do it until I did. 

A few weeks ago, she asked me to go fetch a bunch of dolls my adult cousin wanted to throw away because she's moving overseas. She told me the dolls were made by my grandmother and that my cousin's mom would be sad if they ended up in the trash. I told her I didn't want these dolls and she told me my brother would take them (I later talked to my brother and he told me he didn't want them either). I told her I'd go but the day after because my schedule was pretty full on that day. She then called me to tell me she'd really prefer I go today. Finally, I told her no, I wouldn't go today and I was sick and tired of just being the go-to for every little request and that I had my own problems to deal with. 

She told me not to go and coldly said ""I won't ever ask anything from you then"". I ended up going the next day and sure enough those damn things are still sitting in my closet and nobody is claiming them.

66,1f1piq8,"AITA for ""prioritizing my friends over my boyfriend""","I (19F) am not a native English speaker so I'm sorry if my post is unclear at some point. I'll do my best.

My friends and I have not seen each other for a month and one of us will leave the city soon, so we won't be able to see each other that much in the future. We planned to do a roleplay session and a movie marathon together. We had 2 dates that worked for all of us : Tuesday and Wednesday. And we chose one: Tuesday.

Now since I live an hour away from the city, where my boyfriend (20M) is, and that i'm gonna go to the city to do that plan, me and my boyfriend decided that we would see each other the next day : Wednesday.

But suddenly, one of my friend (21M) said that he had forgotten that he had an appointement to the doctor on Tuesday, so we had to move the plan to Wednesday.

I told my boyfriend that we could see each other the next day, but he really took it badly. He thinks I prefer my friends over him because I moved our plan to the day after.

I told him that it's just for organisation because if I don't do the plan with my friends on that very day, we'll probably have to wait for months before we can do it, while we see each other basically every week and in that case we can see each other the next day. He doesn't seem to understand my point of view and he was mad at me for moving our plan even though I do not feel like this is my fault. He said I should have said that I had something planned that day and just not go, but I want to go, and if I don't my friends can not do it either, they need me for the roleplay. 
He agreed to see me on Thursday because he feels like he has no choice, but he is very upset about this. Also, he is very jealous of the guy that said he had an appointement. I suspect that this is why he is THAT upset, even tho he said he would react the same way if it was with other people.

67,1f1p11w,AITA for telling my husband's parents we are eternally grateful he was born outside America?,"I (22f) might have been rude and I need some clarity on this. My husband (22m) and I welcomed a baby together 6 weeks ago. Her name, Calia, has been poorly received by my husband's parents who think the name is ""weird and lacks excitement"". My husband told them their opinions did not matter and he also told them they had no right to talk given what he was almost named.

The context of that is my husband was born outside America. His mom is Irish, his father is American. When they were first married they lived in another country. MIL wanted to honor her dad, Paddy, by naming my husband after him. FIL wanted it to be more exciting. He was a big fan of a certain rapper who had rebranded around that time... and so they had decided they would name my husband **Piddy** instead of Paddy. MIL was on board with this. The country they were living in at the time had some rules on what a baby could be named and Piddy was rejected. They were always salty about this and mentioned to my husband and his younger siblings several times that they mourned the name Piddy and how it would have beautifully combined a tribute to MILs father and an artist FIL loved. My husband was always relieved they were stopped. He told me about it a few times and at first I didn't believe it and thought his parents were pranking him. But his siblings said it's 100% true because their parents apparently tried renaming my husband when they moved to America and it was too expensive which is why it didn't happen.

My ILs were badmouthing our daughter's name so much that my husband told them they almost named him ""fucking Piddy"" and how could they talk so badly about Calia when that had been on the table for him. They ended up arguing and my ILs turned to me and said they expected me to have better taste and wasn't I going to call my husband on saying those things. I said no. They told me I should be more grateful that they were sharing concerns others would have. That's when I told them we are eternally grateful my husband was born outside America. I was being snarky but I was so done with their complaints about the name.

They called me on being disrespectful and I accept I might be wrong for saying that.

There was a car waiting for someone to leave their spot blocking the side aisle, but no one could move through the main aisle because someone decided to park at the end of the median area and not in a spot (see picture link for the marker).  This essentially made the main aisle a one way.  It was a nice day and I had my windows open...it just so happened that the owners of this vehicle came back while I was stuck in the jam.

69,1f1ots0,AITAH for the below? ,"Sorry for mobile formatting and small rant but I have no idea what to make of this situation and weirdly want some public feedback. If I‚Äôm the AH I want to know. 

Summary: 

My mother, who I have a very close relationship with, shows daily signs of anger, frustration, sadness and just overall depression. This is known by my father and sister, and over the years my family has consistently expressed our concerns to our Mom and she never had the time of day to listen to us, yet we are there for her daily when she is venting about this, that and other things. 

Context:

I‚Äôve dealt with mental health issues for the better part of a decade. I‚Äôve lost 3 best friends in three traumatic deaths over the last 10 years. I‚Äôve gotten nothing but endless support and love from my mother, family and friends. My mother spent countless nights on phone calls with me while living in a different state, doing research on therapy options, typical supportive behaviors from her. It has been a grind for myself and I‚Äôve never been better. I couldn‚Äôt be where I‚Äôm at if it wasn‚Äôt for her (and family).

Current situation and the AITAH question:

Over the last 2ish years, my Dad has basically expressed to my sister and I that trying to sit my Mom down and suggest that SHE would benefit from therapy to discuss the things that bother her is impossible due to her reaction. Her reaction is that we are attacking her. Some default responses from her when this occurs ‚ÄúNobody sees the good in her, she didn‚Äôt know she had a problem, people pick out the bad, therapy won‚Äôt work I already know what they will say‚Äù. 

Yesterday, I walked into a conversation my sister was having with my Mom, basically stating that she‚Äôs concerned and thinks seeking professional help could benefit her. Being blindsided into this conversation, when I was asked if I thought the same, I could not lie about it. Agreeing with my sister set off a nuclear explosion. To make a long story short, through various arguments since that explosion and now, I‚Äôve been told ‚Äúunless I come to you directly with a problem, you don‚Äôt have a place to have concerns about me‚Äù. 

This crushed me. And I lost my cool. I asked why all the push and support of therapy for my problems couldn‚Äôt apply to hers, no real response outside of saying she already knows what they will tell her, but she can‚Äôt express what that is, when I ask it‚Äôs ‚ÄúI just know and don‚Äôt need to tell you‚Äù.

Sorry for mobile formatting and small rant but I have no idea what to make of this situation and weirdly want some public feedback. If I‚Äôm the AH I want to know. 

Summary: 

My mother, who I have a very close relationship with, shows daily signs of anger, frustration, sadness and just overall depression. This is known by my father and sister, and over the years my family has consistently expressed our concerns to our Mom and she never had the time of day to listen to us, yet we are there for her daily when she is venting about this, that and other things. 

Context:

I‚Äôve dealt with mental health issues for the better part of a decade. I‚Äôve lost 3 best friends in three traumatic deaths over the last 10 years. I‚Äôve gotten nothing but endless support and love from my mother, family and friends. My mother spent countless nights on phone calls with me while living in a different state, doing research on therapy options, typical supportive behaviors from her. It has been a grind for myself and I‚Äôve never been better. I couldn‚Äôt be where I‚Äôm at if it wasn‚Äôt for her (and family).

Current situation and the AITAH question:

Over the last 2ish years, my Dad has basically expressed to my sister and I that trying to sit my Mom down and suggest that SHE would benefit from therapy to discuss the things that bother her is impossible due to her reaction. Her reaction is that we are attacking her. Some default responses from her when this occurs ‚ÄúNobody sees the good in her, she didn‚Äôt know she had a problem, people pick out the bad, therapy won‚Äôt work I already know what they will say‚Äù. 

Yesterday, I walked into a conversation my sister was having with my Mom, basically stating that she‚Äôs concerned and thinks seeking professional help could benefit her. Being blindsided into this conversation, when I was asked if I thought the same, I could not lie about it. Agreeing with my sister set off a nuclear explosion. To make a long story short, through various arguments since that explosion and now, I‚Äôve been told ‚Äúunless I come to you directly with a problem, you don‚Äôt have a place to have concerns about me‚Äù. 

This crushed me. And I lost my cool. I asked why all the push and support of therapy for my problems couldn‚Äôt apply to hers, no real response outside of saying she already knows what they will tell her, but she can‚Äôt express what that is, when I ask it‚Äôs ‚ÄúI just know and don‚Äôt need to tell you‚Äù.

A complete change of behavior, I‚Äôve never been once met with a cold shoulder after trying to support my mother and come from a loving place, just like she has done and I‚Äôm sure would continue for me.

72,1f1oi00,AITA Argued With My Mother For Reconnecting Me With A Family Member I Don‚Äôt Like,"To make a long story short but add context, my family is fairly small. And because of various disagreements with childhoods and money, we don‚Äôt see eye to eye. My Aunt is one of those people. We grew up together and practically were Sister and Brother, but that was a decade ago. 

Once I started doing well in life, the energy that started coming from my Aunt was strange, and what I could best describe as discomfort and jealousy. My mother tried to say this was just because we were like siblings in the past, by my argument is that we are grown adults now, and when somebody shows they don‚Äôt like you, that‚Äôs a decision she made as an adult so I won‚Äôt look past it. (I have a lot of experience with keeping friends who have shown similar behaviors and have turned out to be no good). 

Moving forward to present time, my Mother and my Aunt have started hanging out, and going to places like malls and out to eat together. That‚Äôs good for them, but at every opportunity my mother has asked me to meet up with them, I have declined the invitation and explicitly said I have no interest in reconnecting with that family member.  But last week, I agreed to go out with my Mother somewhere, and as I‚Äôm getting ready to leave, she springs it on me that my Aunt was also going and was almost on her way.

And when we all left, my Mother tried to spring the idea of another hangout on us most likely because I am less likely to be rude and say no in front of my Aunt.

After, I was kind of mad and called my Mother weird for trying to arrange the meetup. If I invited a family member she was not comfortable seeing she would have blown up and I know it. I told her that I was angry because if I knew the family member was going I would have never agreed to go, and that if I had a friend or girlfriend that did the same thing, I would see it as a setup and I would never speak to them again.

It's probably one of the most unexpected friendships. She is really popular and bubbly and bright, and, well, I'm on reddit. She's definitely a social butterfly, which works for her. But the thing is she uses social media to make other friends and meet different people. We are in the same grade, but she doesn't have the maturity she portrays to have. She doesn't understand that she has to be careful, especially as a young girl who looks far older (by this I mean looks 20) than she is. Right now she is currently in a group chat on snap with about 3 guys. They claim to be in their 20's. They started out telling her they were her age, but have been changing their story. They also like to ask her to send pictures, give them her address, and meet them irl. Thankfully she has enough common sense to not do any of the above, but the fact that she is even still in contact with them disturbs me. She refuses to report them, and is acting like it's a funny joke or that it's nothing serious. Now, I promise I've done everything I can, I've talked to her many times, tried to tell her how dangerous these guys could be. Even if they aren't getting anything from her right now, it doesn't mean she's safe from them. I was hoping her meeting these people would give her perspective on being more safe, but if anything, it just made her take thing ls less seriously. So I decided yesterday to tell her that her being in contact with these people, and other adults as well, on social media and the Internet could become a serious issue for her. I told her to at least stop telling people her age and name, and to put more thought into what she tells people. She got upset with me and said I was just jealous because I don't have social media, and that I was trying to side with her parents. For reference, her parents are overprotective.

My next door neighbour is in her 90s and on a fixed income. Under the law where I live any dividing fence repairs should be paid 50/50 (and I could take her to court to get a judgement to pay off her half in instalments).
I thought I would not do this as she has limited capacity to pay. 

I took out a personal loan to repair the fence between our properties. The fence in question is a concrete block fence which also acts as a retaining wall. It was cracked and leaning and if I did nothing it was going to fall into her yard.

So I got some experts in and got quotes on the repair before I initially spoke to her. Experts both said the damage was caused by the tree roots on both sides of the fence. 

I said to her I was happy to pay for the full wall repair if she would get the trees out on her side of the fence (I had already got the trees out on my side by then, cost $2000). 
She refused to remove her trees saying she could not afford to do it.

Ok so fence repairs proceed with trees in place. I had to pay 2 labourers to dig a trench alongside the fence on her side of the wall as we could not get machine access due to the trees. I paid for the site prep on both sides and the full cost of the wall repair.

Neighbour has been left with a small trench maybe 10 inches deep by 6 inches wide on her side of the wall at the back of her garden, a couple of small shrubs were damaged and she lost some gravel from her garden bed. She is also complaining that the fence now needs to be repainted after the repair. 

She asked me to pay for this to be rectified and I said no, as I have already spent more than $5000 (not including the tree removal) and she has not spent a cent.

The neighbor this story is about always like to play baseball and the way our neighborhood is set up is his house is facing out to the street and we live across from them so our backyard is in view of the street.

I can't exactly pin when this started but the kid started hitting his baseballs in our yard. Now, I know it's hard to control where the ball goes and doesn't go.  We ask him to stop and then we keep finding them in our yard, it's harmless really and we ask him to stop.

It's harmless until we find one in our pool, floating close to the pump which if it sucked it in it could get suck and break the pump so we ask him to stop, seriously.

He keeps going and at this point we're irritated so we start just throwing the balls away in our trash.

The final breaking point that led us up to calling the police is when my dad and sister were swimming outside and my dad came in and told me that he was going to call the police (non emergency) because they hit the side of our house.

The police arrive after a little bit and they don't do anything bad, just talk to them. After they leave I go back inside and see that in the messager group for the neighborhood the neighbor who's kid kept hitting the ball was talking about how an anonymous person called the police for them. A lot of people were saying that it was dumb and crazy and that got me thinking so I decided to post here.

The neighbor this story is about always like to play baseball and the way our neighborhood is set up is his house is facing out to the street and we live across from them so our backyard is in view of the street.

I can't exactly pin when this started but the kid started hitting his baseballs in our yard. Now, I know it's hard to control where the ball goes and doesn't go.  We ask him to stop and then we keep finding them in our yard, it's harmless really and we ask him to stop.

It's harmless until we find one in our pool, floating close to the pump which if it sucked it in it could get suck and break the pump so we ask him to stop, seriously.

He keeps going and at this point we're irritated so we start just throwing the balls away in our trash.

The final breaking point that led us up to calling the police is when my dad and sister were swimming outside and my dad came in and told me that he was going to call the police (non emergency) because they hit the side of our house.

The police arrive after a little bit and they don't do anything bad, just talk to them. After they leave I go back inside and see that in the messager group for the neighborhood the neighbor who's kid kept hitting the ball was talking about how an anonymous person called the police for them. A lot of people were saying that it was dumb and crazy and that got me thinking so I decided to post here.

When I moved here, I left the house I owned behind and ended up renting it. Recently, my tenant moved out so we were working on fixing it to sell. I hired a contractor friend of my brother‚Äôs. 

My dad was given a free shed. It had to be removed from her property by Tuesday, the 13th. The contractor offered to help him move and rebuild it. The contractor would have had my house done on the 17th and it would already be on the market. But it isn‚Äôt and here is why. Instead of waiting to rebuild the shed, the rebuilding started the next day. The contractor did a little bit of work before going to my Dads property that Tuesday and Wednesday. While rebuilding, the contractor nearly cut his finger off, literally. 

Now the guy has stopped responding. I am out of the deposit. My house is a wreck. It‚Äôs worse than before because there are things partially done. The guy had been off work and desperate for money, so I understand why he didn‚Äôt mention doing it a different day. 

Here is where I may be the asshole. On Monday, I asked my Dad to go take pictures of my house so my husband could see what needs done. He didn‚Äôt. After an argument, I told him ‚Äúfuck it. I‚Äôll ask Cat.‚Äù I also told him I‚Äôm not moving back and he needs to get over it. 

He is telling my brother that I am treating him badly and he‚Äôs not going to put up with it. He is also saying I am blaming him for the contractor getting hurt and for my house not being done. 

In addition to this, I always hear about how I could be living in one of his houses cheaply, he won‚Äôt be able to see his grandchild because of the distance, and that I shouldn‚Äôt have bought my house. I got mad and just snapped.

ETA: he did agree to take the pictures on either Monday or Tuesday. And then decided he didn‚Äôt need to because we both acknowledged a lot of work probably wasn‚Äôt done.

81,1f1mhuk,AITA for being frustrated after I offered the bathroom before I took a shower?,"So for a while I lived with a couple, they're my friends and I had gotten a new job in their area, so they suggested that I lived with them and payed a third of the rent until I found an apartment. 

One day, before we ate, I said ""I'm gonna take a shower, who needs to use the bathroom NOW because then it's gonna be at least 20minutes?"" to let everyone know that for at least 20minutes no one would be able to go to the toilet (same room). The guy says that he needs to go, so I put my towel down and go help his gf in the kitchen. About 10 minutes in I'm wondering what he is doing, after 20minutes I'm asking him directly when he's going to come out of there. That's when her girlfriend snaps that it's so impolite to bother people when they're pooping. I'm arguing that I offered the toilet so no one would be stuck with an emergency (periods or peepee) not for him to spend the night in. She says that when someone is doing their business you just leave them in peace, to which I reply that next time I would not offer the bathroom even if anyone has an emergency. The guy ended up spending 45 minutes on the can. 

Note that I was raised this way; when you are going to monopolize a room that's kind of vital, you offer everyone to use it before it's locked for a long time. Example: my mom's poop smells A LOT so she offers everyone to pee/brush their teeth before she stinks the place up. 

Regarding my situation, we didn't talk about this again because when I brought it up, once, I was faced with reproach and stubbornness, no dialogue, but clearly I was paying the rent, buying my food (I was on a diet so I was not going to bother them with it) and looking for a place and a car to leave them in peace, but I never felt like I had my place in their apartment, and this made me feel really bad. 
I am mainly curious as to how people feel about his behaviour mostly, because I didn't get actually mad or anything, I was overall shocked by what I consider is a lack of manners.

82,1f1maec,AITAH for getting engaged too close to my friend‚Äôs engagement party?,"I, (28M) am planning on proposing to my girlfriend in the next few weeks. I am very excited, but just found out not everyone is. 5 months ago, my friend proposed to his fianc√© (March of 2024). Right after, he had an engagement party with close family, so me and my friends did not celebrate with him that day. His fianc√© and he planned another, larger engagement party at his house for next week. Coincidentally, my girlfriend‚Äôs birthday is the same day, so. I had previously booked a trip for her birthday, during which i plan on proposing (not the same day, and she has told me she would love if it was on the trip. She knows I‚Äôm proposing in the coming months.) I had other ideas to propose, such as in October at more local places, but availability and vision didn‚Äôt work out, so I  decided to do it on the trip.

Some background too, my friend is getting married august 8, 2025. My girlfriend and I have kind of started planning a wedding in her home country, and we picked the latest date possible for the ‚Äúnon- rainy season‚Äù, which is October 4th. I have somewhat kept my friends in the loop that this was the plan.

Yesterday, my girlfriend texted my friends fianc√© informing her we wouldn‚Äôt be able to make it, and that we wanted to send something from their registry. Fianc√© texted back that it was ok and we‚Äôll all get together soon, which seemed fine. My friend texted me 10 minutes later asking to talk. Apparently his fianc√© is upset I am proposing the week after their engagement party. He didn‚Äôt explicitly say she was upset about the wedding dates, but he hinted that she‚Äôs also upset the wedding would be close to theirs (august 8th vs October 4th).

I understand not wanting to feel like your day isn‚Äôt special, I‚Äôm just kind of upset about the situation. We don‚Äôt have any mutual friends really, since all the people that will be at their party/wedding are not really my friends nor will they be at my wedding. The only overlap is my friend and his fianc√©, and 3 of our close childhood friends. The rest of their 140 something guests are not crossovers, nor are my 45 other guests. Also I thought their first engagement party was the serious one because it was at a nice restaurant and apparently was expensive, but also I probably misunderstood this and shouldn‚Äôt have, since they sent the formal invitation for the engagement party next week. I would never purposefully try to plan my events near my friends‚Äô events, and I tried not to do it here, but due to the pre planned trip it seemed to make sense.

My (22f) close friend Lucy (22f) used to live with their now ex friend Viv (22f) about 2 years ago. It was a very messy situation but I am still good friends with both of them now. Lucy was in a relationship that ended badly and the breakup traumatised her for a long time after, causing severe depression and anything that reminded her of him would set her off and keep her mentally stagnant. Viv was living with her during this time as she could not live with her family or find her own place yet. They were like sisters most of the time but their friendship was also quite toxic in hindsight. 

Viv started dating an old friend of Lucy‚Äôs ex-boyfriend (the two guys didnt really speak much anymore) and was frustrated that she couldn‚Äôt even mention his name as he was associated with Lucy‚Äôs ex and Lucy would get angry, make comments about Viv, and this was just was one example of how Lucy would refuse the possibility of moving on from her ex. This was also exacerbated by how Lucy‚Äôs parents acted as well in that they enabled her feelings way past being healthy and, in Viv‚Äôs view, did not help her enough to get over her ex. Viv gets increasingly stressed and frustrated by all their behaviour which resulted in her moving out suddenly and telling Lucy‚Äôs parents that Lucy‚Äôs mother wasn‚Äôt doing enough to help Lucy. The way in which Viv handled this is something none of us agreed with, but she regrets it to this day. I was caught in the middle of this and didn‚Äôt want to cut myself off from either as I value both of their friendships. I could see where both of them were coming from when they had these issues, and I would also tell both of them that i thought some of their actions were unkind.

 I stayed in contact with Viv and talk to her semi-regularly, and now I‚Äôm moving out of the city to to back home (where Lucy lives and where we all come from) Viv has also expressed that she wants to move back from the city too. I think she‚Äôd be a great housemate and we‚Äôve stayed pretty close mates and we‚Äôve talked about the possibility of moving in together, which we both think would make a lot of sense. Lucy is not aware we‚Äôve stayed in contact this much  (purely just because i never bring her up around her, but why would i considering they‚Äôd fallen out?). Now that I want to bring this up to her, so I‚Äôm not going behind her back, it‚Äôs making me very anxious and I don‚Äôt know that I even should because of how she used to react whenever Viv was brought up.

She told me she gave me the name Alexander for a reason and I should stop trying to discard the name she lovingly chose for me. She also told me I'm screwing myself because people take Alexander far more serious than they take Lex. She called and complained to the teacher in charge of the newsletter too which was humiliating. I got berated all afternoon after the newsletter went out Tuesday. My mom told me I need to make it right and to stop using Lex in school.

86,1f1l2h6,AITA for disagreeing with my family about appropriate ways to handle the upcoming death of my grandfather ,"I (27F) got a call that my grandfather doesn‚Äôt have much time left. He‚Äôs been battling dementia for almost 10 years, and been on hospice for several years. Hospice thought he wouldn‚Äôt make it through the weekend - between being immobile, can‚Äôt open his eyes, can‚Äôt eat, doesn‚Äôt even have the strength to close his mouth, and muttering incoherent words, etc. he definitely won‚Äôt make it through the next few weeks. 

All of this to say - the elder generation of my family is desensitized to this. They‚Äôve gotten calls so many times that ‚Äúthis could be it‚Äù that it‚Äôs almost like they‚Äôve just been waiting for him to die for the last several years. 

There‚Äôs several things that my family (mostly parents) have chosen to do that I disagree with and have spoken out about. And I have been chastised for being in the wrong. 

1. My parents refused to tell my older siblings (35-40) that this is happening. Their only excuse is them living in another state. I was explicitly demanded to not tell them. I thought this was BS so I called my siblings and told them anyways. My siblings would have found out anyways based on things my mother is posting online about a sudden influx of family in town. My siblings are incredibly hurt that our parents had no plans to tell them, and then were so explicitly obvious about what‚Äôs happening online. 

2. Over the weekend I went to visit my grandfather in hospice to say my goodbyes. In the room my mother and aunt were discussing post mortem arrangements. How my aunt would be the one to identify his corpse before cremation, etc. hearing is the last thing to go - and I knew he could still hear us based on his reactions to other conversations. I looked at my mom and said ‚Äúthese conversations can wait until he‚Äôs not in the room‚Äù. She said something to the effect of ‚Äúwell this conversation needed to happen‚Äù. I responded ‚Äúbut it doesn‚Äôt need to happen right now, with him in the room, while he‚Äôs still alive‚Äù. 

I distinctly believe death shouldn‚Äôt be a taboo topic. And discussing someone‚Äôs death with them is essential. But talking about such dark postmortem arrangements with a dying man in the room is so insensitive to him, and the purpose of everyone flocking to say goodbyes and hopefully provide comfort. 

As soon as it was just me and my dad in the room, he scolded me for ‚Äútelling my mother what she can and cannot do‚Äù and said ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt like it you can leave‚Äù

It‚Äôs just as easy for the people having these conversations to leave the room as it is for me to leave the room. 

Later when I talked to my husband about it he said he was surprised when I said that and expressed him agreeing with my family.

89,1f1jnrt,AITA for getting a sellers bank suspended?,"So a little over 2 weeks I ""brought"" an item from FB marketplace. Seller listed it on the Wednesday but got a deal to pay a day later. First red flags were that his PayPal supposedly wasn't working and did bank transfer.(done bank transfer previously with another seller so wasn't obvious to me at the time where this would go) The first issue arose when seller stated same day postage. That never happened and after 2 days he said the item had an issue in which he said he could refund or fix but I said i could fix it myself. Responses went down and i got a bit pissy and said after xyz time if there's no response then I'm wanting a refund. Seller got annoyed by this and In my opinion I may have been in the wrong for that idk. 

After a few days I asked how said item was doing he said it was fixed and I asked for a video or pic of how I would need to do maintenance on it as it's a custom model. No media was sent and when I asked about when it would be posted again no response but asking about the model he said he still needed to retest it. Cut to just last week I ended up being fed up with the wait and asked for a refund. He said he it's fairs and would refund asap. After that I gave him my bank link and he said his bank wouldn't do a FTP or whatever it's called. Tried linking him to PayPal same thing. I ended up trying a chargeback as I knew it was gonna be more and more excuses and chargeback was denied tho his bank was frozen/suspended. He then started sending more and more messages than his low response/message rate as he got notified that his bank was frozen. He's due to apparently look at his bank tomorrow and in the case he sees what happened what's the best response afterwards?

Edit: Forgot to add what's the best thing to do as my only concern now if he blasts my messages or smth.

90,1f1jgor,AITA For not letting my roommate keep her dog in our apartment.,"For context I just moved into this apartment a week ago and have 3 random roommates. We all go to the same university and live in a college town. I was going to keep living with my friends/past roommates but this new apartment is closer to my classes/job so it just makes more sense.

When I signed my lease I made sure to click no pets and even wrote in Please no pets. Over the summer I got multiple emails and calls from the leasing office asking if I would be ok with a roommate with a pet, if I was sure about no pets, etc. All to which I replied I signed a no pet lease please don‚Äôt place me with someone who has a pet. 

Fast forward to right before school. I got a text from my future roommate asking which room I got and if we could switch so her dog could have better access to the balcony. I replied back with hey I don‚Äôt know which room I have yet but just to be 100% transparent I signed specifically for a no pet lease and feel uncomfortable switching that. And told her to contact our leasing office as they would probably have a solution (to have a pet in our apartment you have to have each roommate sign off on it). She replied back saying not to worry her dog is trained, certified, and only going to be in her room etc.

My mom told me not to reply back to her message because quite frankly it had nothing to do with what I said. The whole situation made me upset because she didn‚Äôt even ask if I was ok with living with a pet she just assumed I would be fine and willing to switch rooms with her. I wanted to call the leasing office but my mom said not to because I shouldn‚Äôt have to switch rooms & that she should because she obviously must have signed a no pet lease too if we got paired. It‚Äôs not like I am a monster who hates animals. I grew up on a farm and have dogs myself. I just think it‚Äôs inhumane to bring an animal to college. They are a lot of work & I don‚Äôt want to be responsible for cleaning up after her dog or be up all night from barking. Like that‚Äôs why I signed a no pet lease. One of the roommates asked if anyone had any pets. She sent a pic of the dog in our GC 
it‚Äôs a golden retriever puppy. They seem to be fine with it as they all responded with cute.

Anyways she moved in late today. I haven‚Äôt seen her yet but I heard the dog barking. üíÄ My sister made a good point because she said there‚Äôs no way a puppy could be certified. I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do because I seem to be the only one with a problem. I really don‚Äôt want to cause any beef literally the first week here.

He was busy and was working on an incredibly important gig on a national level, so I tried to keep to myself.

After the convention, I was so drained that I cried when I returned to my mom‚Äôs friend‚Äôs room. I was reeling from not having my meds, and I just wanted to go home after a sleepless night. I said my goodbyes through text, but I forgot to lock his front door. When I got home, my mom called and was furious about it, which I understand‚ÄîI could have caused a serious issue.

I know it was wrong to leave without locking the door, but was I really wrong to start giving my mom the silent treatment after she immediately berated me? She didn't even ask if I got home safe.

For context, my mom and dad were never married and I was born when she was 18. She took care of me for about a year before going to work abroad, leaving me with my grandma. She‚Äôd visit once a year for holidays or my birthday, but eventually, the visits stopped when I was around 10. We rarely talked. When we did, I was always the one initiating the conversations. She'd hardly contact me outside of it because it was a ""waste of time.""

When I was 10, she got upset over my academic struggles and shouted at me before leaving. I became an honor student eventually, but she was never really present for my achievements.

When I was 12. She had a boyfriend and forced me to live with them for a week. I was so uncomfortable that I threw up on their stairs. When they broke up at the end of the week, she was angry at me for being happy to go home, even though I never wanted to stay there in the first place. My grandma lied to get me there, saying we were just going for new shoes. I left with my mom, both of us incredibly devastated.

When I was 16 or 17, I told my mom I was severely depressed. Her response was to just get over it, saying therapy was a waste. I still went to therapy for a brief time, but my grandma eventually pressured me into stopping because it was ""financially bad"" even though we could afford it.

I decided to reserve everyone a nice place for dinner since they will all be leaving town tomorrow. We all received our order in a fair amount of time except my aunt. She seemed pretty disappointed (rightfully so) but when asked if we still wanted her meal she declined. The service worker obviously felt horrible and actually brought her out a complimentary dessert as a way to say thank you. No one else had issues with their order. 

As were finishing up and signing the bill, one of my relatives pointed out that we should leave because they didn‚Äôt want to be around when the waiter read the note that my mom left on her check. 
I made sure everyone left first and flipped the check to see that she had wrote ‚ÄúDo better next time‚Äù on the back. Mortified, I grabbed the pen and tried to scribble out as much as I could. When taking them back to the hotel, I let my mom know that her behavior was not okay and that people are allowed to make mistakes. 

She just kept being firm that he should‚Äôve provided better service and that she wrote the note so he could always have a reminder to have better service. It basically turned into a yelling match since she can never be wrong and I eventually just gave up the conversation for the moment. 

After I got home, I did text her and apologize for the yelling but let her know that I still did not agree with her actions. She said since I‚Äôm family I should stick with her decisions whether they are right or wrong and not to worry about the situation because she won‚Äôt be coming back to visit. She also added that my reaction is the reason we are not close. 

I guess I‚Äôm just feeling sad and disgusted all at the same time. I feel like she raised me to treat everyone with respect but for whatever reason she doesn‚Äôt feel the need to anymore. AITAH? 

",Not the A-hole,2024-08-26,"AITAH for holding my family accountable?  So a family member just recently had a wedding and everyone flew out to attend including my mom. This would be the first time she‚Äôs visited me since I moved out of state in 2021.
I decided to reserve everyone a nice place for dinner since they will all be leaving town tomorrow. We all received our order in a fair amount of time except my aunt. She seemed pretty disappointed (rightfully so) but when asked if we still wanted her meal she declined. The service worker obviously felt horrible and actually brought her out a complimentary dessert as a way to say thank you. No one else had issues with their order.

I (17NB) had started this conversation at about 10:30pm by asking my sister (15F) to be done with the call, as I'd be trying to sleep soon. She refused, saying she'd only turn down the volume of the call, and her own voice.

Then, at 11, I texted her asking her to hang up the call again, reiterating I wanted to sleep. I also texted both our parents by asking them to ask her to hang up.

Then, at 12 (25 minutes ago), I go into her room, which shares a wall with mine, and ask her to hang up the phone. She refuses, saying she's had a shitty week and is having fun with her friends on call. Now, I wouldn't have a problem with this, if I didn't have work early in the morning.

Once  I had to throw her on The bed and hold her mouth and sit on her, she said stop, but I had to do It because she wouldnt let me speak, she was talking and raising her voice so what could I do? then she started shaking and crying so I stopped because I think she had a panic attack cause of her ex, but I would never hurt her so I got on my knees and begged her, which worked. I had no other choice but to do it this way, she is so difficult to talk to during fights.. and since then all I hear About is how I did it, she wont let it go, she wants a therapy, which is fine by me but I said she doesnt need it and If she does she shouldnt be in a relationship, because what is The point ?

Simons partner Kate (30F used to my best friend and was even a bridesmaid in our wedding) of almost a year has 3 children (9M, 5M and 2M). Yes I was the nicest person for a few months after the break up but l've actually changed myself through therapy, even Simon has acknowledged that as well.

I am civil towards Kate in front of my children and her children.

I have asked Simon multiple times if it can be just him when I take our children to the park or to relatives houses, but Kate always shows up with her kids.

Simon has barely had the kids since we broke up because ""it's hard to juggle 5 kids"" his words not mine

So onto the main reason for the post.

My daughters 2nd birthday is next week and Simon has arranged for myself, our children and some others to go over to my in laws for our daughters birthday.

I have asked Simon if it can be just him that could be present because when im present with Kate and her kids, Simon generally ignores our kids in favour of Kate's kids. Like bending over backwards for them in front of our children and our children act differently around him, with always having bad behaviour after these visits.

Kate will repeatedly interject on mine and Simon's conversations even if it's about our children. If myself or Simon are helping Simon's dad, she will stand near us almost as if watching us but not saying a word.

Whenever I bring it up to Simon, he gets defensive and goes on a tangent about how I'm unfairly excluding Kate.

So AlTA?

99,1f1htub,AITAH for asking these questions and sending this message to my girlfriend? *Trigger warning*,"I‚Äôll catch you all up to speed‚Ä¶.
So I (m26 former SA victim from my grandpa for 3 years, ages 6 to 9) will be posting the texts I had sent to my now-ex-girlfriend (f26) in regard to a very specific SA situation that happened to her at the strip club she was dancing at this past year, and ultimately what ended up ending our relationship. 
Any time I brought up the points listed in this following text in-person, she would blow up and get in a huge fight with me and never let me actually finish my point, and then will start trying to use my SA as a child as a weapon, by saying things like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt ask you any of those questions about you and your grandpa!‚Äù Or like, ‚Äúwell then I don‚Äôt believe that happened to you from your grandpa! You must be making it up!‚Äù. 

Now, as a victim of SA, I agree on the importance of siding with the victim and always be in the victims favor. However, if literally all the evidence surrounding the alleged crime is against the alleged victim‚Äôs claim, and insists that the whole alleged crime was made up to justify victim‚Äôs actions on the night of the alleged SA‚Ä¶.. im not going to have it. Especially if it‚Äôs something that is directly affecting me and my relationship on a daily basis. 
***I have my ex girlfriend‚Äôs consent to post this text thread on Reddit to see what the world thinks about our situation. 


She initiated talking about this by sending this, and I replied with this, including a preface even! 

Her: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs incredibly hard for me to show you emotions. You denying my experience about something that traumatizing has put up a huge huge wall. It‚Äôs been up since the first time you ever questioned me about it all which I‚Äôm pretty sure was in the basement at the cabin.‚Äù 

Her: ‚ÄúBut I am aching, my heart is broken‚Äù

Her: ‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt think that wall will ever come down‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt you realize the magnitude of what you‚Äôre doing when you say that shit.‚Äù 

And then my response:

Me: ‚ÄúOkay, im about to send a text that is purely out of love and mutual respect. It may be a trigger for you a bit, but know that there is absolutely NO animosity or anger or resentment behind my message. It‚Äôs just me finally explaining what I need to about that night, and thoroughly doing so, just do we can find a mutual understanding of what happened. I‚Äôve needed to do this, and I want you to know how I feel truly. I do believe you. I do stand with you. I will always stand with you. I just need you to understand my place. I love you‚Äù

Here‚Äôs the big one right after:

Me: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not denying it any more. All im trying to do is make you realize why, with ALL of the shit surrounding it, it makes it so difficult for me to believe it fully. I‚Äôm going to type this out, so it‚Äôs in writing and I don‚Äôt have to say it ever again. 

1. You had been intertwined with him for a couple weeks at this point. 
2. We had a big fight about him before this happened, and you said you‚Äôd never talk to him again.  
3. I was outside the club that whole night, and you called me so many times while in there and made it seem like you were hiding from him, but then you went back on the floor and ignored me till you were ready to leave at almost 4am. 
4. When you left, he said something to you, and you smirked at him then got in my car. 
5. When you got in the car you made sure to mention a ‚Äúnew girl friend‚Äù named Layla, that works at the club. 
6. When we got home you were having the time of your life being goofy and eating Taco Bell
7. I looked at your phone cause I felt like something was weird about the Nemo thing still.
8. Suspicion was correct, his name is Layla in your phone and he was texting you the whole time making sure you made it home safe and that everything was ‚Äúchill‚Äù at home. 
9. After digging deeper I saw that you had texted him earlier when spotting him at the club and said you can‚Äôt handle how hot he is, and how you want to fuck him so bad, and that youre gonna suck his dick. 
10. We get in a fight about it, and pretty much have our first ‚Äúbreakup‚Äù fight. And the first person you call is him, to possibly come pick you up. 
11. This is after you tell me that you got assaulted, but wouldn‚Äôt tell me who or how or what. 
12. You changed the story 3 or 4 times till the most recent one where you finally told me what all the way happened. 
13. The next day, when things had somewhat settled down and we were both sober, and had slept all night, we got in another argument, and you and again you threatened me to have the hells angels come and rob all my stuff and beat me up. 



Okay, so that‚Äôs my perspective of the whole thing. All I want is for you to understand how everything listed there made it hard to believe. 
I also want you to know, I believe you were taken advantage of that night. I believe you did things you wouldn‚Äôt normally do had you been sober. 
I also wonder if maybe, while you were drunk, you told him about your kinks, and perhaps he was trying to act them out and turn you on. 
Cause you told Castro about the punching you in the head while fucking fantasy, so I could see you also telling Nemo in your drunkenness at the time. 
I also want to know whether or not if Nemo knows what he did was wrong and forced or if he thought he was gonna fulfill your fantasy, IF you had told him about it at some point. 

I‚Äôm sending this message 100% out of love and just wanting a mutual understanding. That‚Äôs it. There is absolutely no anger while typing this out. There is no shame. No blame or guilt. Just the best way for me to list everything out from my perspective and the wish for you to at least reconcile with me about all of it. 

I believe you were assaulted if you were assaulted. I‚Äôm on your side no matter what. I just want to know where his head and your head were at in those moments, and why I was so fucked up over it all.‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúAnd know how incredibly sorry I am that you had to go through any of it. I love you. And I wish I could take all of your pain away. I‚Äôd do anything for you to just be happy. Also, that is the absolute last time I‚Äôll talk about it.‚Äù 


And she replied by saying that I‚Äôm the reason the #metoo movement exists, and that I‚Äôm a disgusting man for questioning any of this. And that she‚Äôs embarrassed to have ever dated me. And a bunch of other very unreasonable, hurtful comments etc. 

I feel like my points were valid and very much so a reasonable list of concerns. What do you think?",TL;DR,2024-08-26,"AITAH for asking these questions and sending this message to my girlfriend? *Trigger warning* I‚Äôll catch you all up to speed‚Ä¶.

9. After digging deeper I saw that you had texted him earlier when spotting him at the club and said you can‚Äôt handle how hot he is, and how you want to fuck him so bad, and that youre gonna suck his dick. 
10. We get in a fight about it, and pretty much have our first ‚Äúbreakup‚Äù fight. And the first person you call is him, to possibly come pick you up. 
11. This is after you tell me that you got assaulted, but wouldn‚Äôt tell me who or how or what. 
12. You changed the story 3 or 4 times till the most recent one where you finally told me what all the way happened. 
13. The next day, when things had somewhat settled down and we were both sober, and had slept all night, we got in another argument, and you and again you threatened me to have the hells angels come and rob all my stuff and beat me up. 



Okay, so that‚Äôs my perspective of the whole thing. All I want is for you to understand how everything listed there made it hard to believe. 
I also want you to know, I believe you were taken advantage of that night. I believe you did things you wouldn‚Äôt normally do had you been sober. 
I also wonder if maybe, while you were drunk, you told him about your kinks, and perhaps he was trying to act them out and turn you on. 
Cause you told Castro about the punching you in the head while fucking fantasy, so I could see you also telling Nemo in your drunkenness at the time. 
I also want to know whether or not if Nemo knows what he did was wrong and forced or if he thought he was gonna fulfill your fantasy, IF you had told him about it at some point. 

I‚Äôm sending this message 100% out of love and just wanting a mutual understanding. That‚Äôs it. There is absolutely no anger while typing this out. There is no shame. No blame or guilt. Just the best way for me to list everything out from my perspective and the wish for you to at least reconcile with me about all of it. 

I believe you were assaulted if you were assaulted. I‚Äôm on your side no matter what. I just want to know where his head and your head were at in those moments, and why I was so fucked up over it all.‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúAnd know how incredibly sorry I am that you had to go through any of it. I love you. And I wish I could take all of your pain away. I‚Äôd do anything for you to just be happy. Also, that is the absolute last time I‚Äôll talk about it.‚Äù 


And she replied by saying that I‚Äôm the reason the #metoo movement exists, and that I‚Äôm a disgusting man for questioning any of this. And that she‚Äôs embarrassed to have ever dated me. And a bunch of other very unreasonable, hurtful comments etc. 

I feel like my points were valid and very much so a reasonable list of concerns. What do you think?",,1.0540777444839478,1,0

So earlier this week my ex (23m) came into the school to pick up his niece early. Not surprising we live in the same area, I was close with his sisters, and when they heard I was gonna work here, his sister enrolled her daughter here. Admittedly when he walked in I made sure I was the one to attend him, and as we were waiting for his niece to come up to the office, we made conversation. I wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable at all and I doubt that I looked uncomfortable. 

As I was talking with my ex, my coworker came up to me and tried to like wrap his arm around my waist and pull me into him. THAT made me uncomfortable so I stepped away from him, and asked him, nicely might I add, what he was doing. He pulled me aside and told me that I
looked like I was uncomfortable talking to that guy, so he came up to me to try and ‚Äúhelp me out.‚Äù I guess he was trying to do that thing where when a woman looks uncomfortable in public, someone will go up to her and pretend to know her to get her out of the situation. I had just told him that I wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable, and that I was fine bc I didn‚Äôt want to make a big deal out of it.

Later during our break, he came up to me to explain a little more.

I was working 12-14 shifts 5-6 days a week while my wife took care of our baby full time. We were both completely drained and Sam volunteered to take care of our baby so we could have a date night to ourselves for the first time since she was born. It was an amazing and generous offer so obviously we accepted. 

At the time, Sam was 10 years sober and was genuinely helpful, so we had no issues with her watching her. We never knew of her having any slip ups, and no reason to think she would ever start using again.

The day came, I was still at work and my wife was at home with my daughter when Sam arrived. Sam told my wife to start getting ready and that she could take our daughter for a walk. My wife took the offer and hopped in the shower. While I was at work, I received a notification from my ring doorbell that someone was on my porch. I watched the video only to find my mother-in-law smoking a shit ton of meth right on the front at our house.

By the time I saw it, my wife already called me and asked me what she should do. I was fueled with anger so I exploded and said something on the sorts of ""she needs to get the fuck out of our house asap"" and that our daughter couldve came into contact with it. I then made some angry threats towards her mother and she hung up on me.

She then confronted her mother and said that I was coming home and that she needed to be gone by the time I was home because she was afraid of what I was gonna do or say. Sam had the audacity to deny that she was smoked meth, then blamed the stress of watching our daughter and having to take care of her mom as to why shes smoked it at our house.

We get into the car after dinner and she brings up how inappropriate it was that I said what I did about guns and how everyone felt uncomfortable about ‚Äúyou talking about guns‚Äù. And that everyone agreed with her when she said something to me about it.

At worst it was just a bad joke. I feel like based on our argument she‚Äôs expecting me to be perfectly poised in front of her friends. Am I the asshole?",1.0,1.0474568605422974,1,1

110,1f1gnmd,AITA for being jealous because my gf's bestfriend who's very sick says romantic stuff? ,"
Hi. So to make some context me and my girlfriend (both females) have known each other from around 8 years ago, dating 2. 

Most of our relationship is fantastic, not trouble at all. But I'm having problems with one guy she knows.

My girlfriend doesn't have the best close family so she made most of her most important relationship with more far away family members and the childhood friends she made along the way. She met when she was little two boys (both two years older than her), let's call boy one Peter and boy two Chuck.

I'm more jealous than her but mostly because she's almost numb to the feeling. She understands it and respects it but almost never feels it so even if I'm not that jealous compared to what I've seen in real life compared to her it's always a lot. 

I don't have problems when she's really lovely with family members, obviously, that would be sick. Neither with most of her friends, they're all really nice. 

The problem it's always Peter and Chuck. She treats them as her biological brothers which I see no problem on it till you check their history. I have two best male friends which I consider my siblings and I love to death too but they don't act like us at all. Like yeah, I would die for them but even then there's just some stuff you don't do with anyone that it's not your partner. 

As they're childhood friends they changed multiple times in front of each other. Wouldn't mind if they were kids doing it but they did it till like they were 14-16.  When they were kids they kissed in the mouth to say goodbye to each other which would be cute if they didn't do it till they were around 12-14. And my girlfriend admitted before we dated that they both had a crush on her once at least. She even tried to date Peter once but didn't work out because she sees him too much as a brother. 

She doesn't do anything of this since a good time ago, quite a decent time before we started dating, obviously. 

The thing is that Peter had a pretty big accident and won't probably make it far. And he's the one I have more trouble with because he's the one that has followed her more insistently since always. She went to see him at the hospital before a pretty important surgery two weeks ago. 

I feel sick to my stomach of saying this because dude, he's a person that is slowly dying. I hope he doesn't, but there's always the probability he won't make it. I don't want to give my girlfriend trouble with the stuff he says because it could be the last words he ever says to her and she's obviously devastated. 

He told her that she is the love of his life ""platonically"". I would believe it if they really had a normal sibling relationship like me with my older brother or my bestfriends. Not even once I thought about dating or liking any of them. He loves her romantically. 

Apart from this he's a really nice person.

We met in middle school and have been friends even since. When we first met, he was pretty stuck on himself and full of pride. About 5 years into our friendship, I started saying ""I love you"" to him because he was like a brother to me. All he would say back is ""L-word you too"". Now we both say ""love you"" and he kisses me on the forehead when we hug goodbye and when I am visibly upset.

Both he and I are fans of Hazbin Hotel. We consider our relationship to be like Charlie and Lucifer (me being Charlie and him Lucifer). After we had been talking about the show for awhile, I said ""I love you more than anything"". He is one of the friends I would do absolutely anything for. He responded with ""love you too"", which took me off guard. I repeated ""more than anything?"" and he responded ""more than 90% of things I guess"". I just kind of sat there, a bit taking back by what his response to that was.

After talking to him some more, I said that he was at the top of my people list, while he said it was not mutual the other way around. I know people are different, but that somewhat hurt. I have always been so insecure that I go overboard with loving my friends, and this didn't help. He started to get upset, ""what, do you not think I care enough?"" and I stated back ""I think maybe I care a bit too much"".

He just got even more mad, saying how he is never good enough for me, and that my needs are a bit too complex for him. I got mad and said that I already have a lot of unmet needs (my love language being words of affirmation, and he barely works with that). He always talks about preaching that my needs are important, but as soon as I bring up my needs, he basically responds with ""not much we can do about it"". I do my best to fulfill his quality time needs, and also share words of affirmation as well. But if I say thing nice to him, I know I won't get it in return.

I legit just don't know who is the A in this situation. I feel like the biggest A for making a big deal over a stupid saying. I am just having a lot of doubt in my mind at the moment and am not sure what to do. It would just be nice to have something like that returned. But I am aware that you can force a thing like that.

He is the one that brought up love languages a few years ago. We both have severe childhood traumas, me being emotionally abused, and him being abandoned and physically abused. We went to group therapy together and found this would be very beneficial to our friendship as a whole.

I reasked ""more than anything?"" because he tends not to read my whole message at times. I literally asked him one time to meet me at my place once and he swore up and down I never told him. I had to show him the message. He misses things sometimes and he asked that I ask if I am unsure.

I am currently in therapy, and have been for a few years. I am not giving any excuses for my behavior. I genuinely want to be a better person and learn.

Bad news is alcohol. I know a lot of kids claim EVERYTHING is traumatic nowadays but having to watch my mom come home too drunk to walk, in another guys car and having to take the responsibility of cleaning her, trying to get her to sleep, giving her water.

I‚Äôve never gotten used to her slurred insults & passive aggressive cruelty to me under the influence. this was not an uncommon occurrence.

I know he drinks beer, wine, and even liquor which is dandy I don‚Äôt really care until it starts seeping into my life which is hard to avoid considering I live with him. Lately his girlfriend (who‚Äôs studying to be a really good nurse) has commented on the way that it appears he‚Äôs been consuming alcoholic beverages as if it‚Äôs water lately. Seeing his response be dismissive and slightly defensive/aggressive set a huge red flag to me. I lock myself away in my room when he‚Äôs drunk or even tipsy to avoid any conflict at all since my default settings for dealing with drunkards is aggression/anger.¬†
So to evade giving my dad any issues with my unresolved ones I leave. But it‚Äôs been happening more often, his behavior. Rough housing, body grabbing, raised voices, activities I‚Äôm not comfortable with etc. lately I‚Äôve been getting fed up, & so has his girlfriend.¬†


he‚Äôs been out ALL day, & came home drunk. Not drunk out of his mind saying this bcs I‚Äôm sure he can remember this argument we had but drunk enough for me to want to leave quickly. In my anger about this I made a mess, and gave him some attitude after he started gripping my clothes to pull me into a hug, something I didn‚Äôt appreciate. He was obviously hurt by this and went outside for a bit. I waited at the door for him and went to give him a hug GNüåô because I felt bad for getting angry at him for no reason. 


He told me no, he didn‚Äôt want to touch me because I rudely asked him not to grab my clothes. I said ‚Äúalright fine, but if you‚Äôre not here in the morning don‚Äôt make that my problem.‚Äù I went upstairs. He soon follows after I‚Äôm assuming his girlfriend told him to and he asked me WTF that was all about & I couldn‚Äôt answer, why?¬†


Because he‚Äôs drunk. It doesn‚Äôt matter if I spill my emotional guts on the floor about his ex-wife because I‚Äôm unsure that he‚Äôd have the same amount of care for it if he were sober.¬†

I know he drinks beer, wine, and even liquor which is dandy I don‚Äôt really care until it starts seeping into my life which is hard to avoid considering I live with him. Lately his girlfriend (who‚Äôs studying to be a really good nurse) has commented on the way that it appears he‚Äôs been consuming alcoholic beverages as if it‚Äôs water lately. Seeing his response be dismissive and slightly defensive/aggressive set a huge red flag to me. I lock myself away in my room when he‚Äôs drunk or even tipsy to avoid any conflict at all since my default settings for dealing with drunkards is aggression/anger.¬†
So to evade giving my dad any issues with my unresolved ones I leave. But it‚Äôs been happening more often, his behavior. Rough housing, body grabbing, raised voices, activities I‚Äôm not comfortable with etc. lately I‚Äôve been getting fed up, & so has his girlfriend.¬†


he‚Äôs been out ALL day, & came home drunk. Not drunk out of his mind saying this bcs I‚Äôm sure he can remember this argument we had but drunk enough for me to want to leave quickly. In my anger about this I made a mess, and gave him some attitude after he started gripping my clothes to pull me into a hug, something I didn‚Äôt appreciate. He was obviously hurt by this and went outside for a bit. I waited at the door for him and went to give him a hug GNüåô because I felt bad for getting angry at him for no reason. 


He told me no, he didn‚Äôt want to touch me because I rudely asked him not to grab my clothes. I said ‚Äúalright fine, but if you‚Äôre not here in the morning don‚Äôt make that my problem.‚Äù I went upstairs. He soon follows after I‚Äôm assuming his girlfriend told him to and he asked me WTF that was all about & I couldn‚Äôt answer, why?¬†


Because he‚Äôs drunk. It doesn‚Äôt matter if I spill my emotional guts on the floor about his ex-wife because I‚Äôm unsure that he‚Äôd have the same amount of care for it if he were sober.¬†

116,1f1fyt9,AITA for being too comfortable with my roomate?,"
I [24F] have a close friend [22F]. I am also good friends with her brother [18M]. He had been desperately wanting to move out and so was I. We decided to rent a studio apartment. Before agreeing to be roomates, I told him that I won't want to be modest now that I am getting my own place finally so if we live there together he would end up seeing me naked a lot and he said it wouldn't bother him. We won't do anything sexual to each other because we are roomates and cause of my friendship with his sister.

Me and him have been living together for 3 months now. We see each other naked multiple times a day. We walk around and lounge around and sleep in different states of undress and will both be naked getting ready in our bathroom at the same time often. I will admit a few times we have made sexual comments to each other. I told him I liked his penis the first time I saw him naked and he said I have a great butt. But we know not to cross the line farther than the occasional comment like that. We are now super comfortable with each other.

His sister stayed the night with us. His sister has seen me naked a bunch of times before. In the morning she saw me walk into the bathroom naked while he was showering.

She questioned me about it and I said we aren't concerned about nudity as we live together in a small space and its more comfortable. She got mad saying I am ""preying on and grooming"" her little brother and betraying our friendship. Reminder that he is 18, not a minor anymore

That being said, I do think that her being his older sister, she has to protect him out of relationships i guess, but its dumb in my opinion.

My fianc√© (27M) and I (25F) have been together for 10 years so I‚Äôve grown up with his family and have always had a good relationship with them but recently we had a falling out. 
I went on a trip with my daughter to go visit my parents who live about 1.5 hours away and the whole reason for my visit was so they could look after my daughter and I could carry on working while she was on holiday, I had first asked my mother in law and she declined saying that she was busy and would not be able to stay with us for 3 weeks. The day that I left my mother in law then calls my fianc√© and asks if she could come pick him up because she‚Äôs lonely (we had let his younger brothers 13 and 18 stay with us during the holiday) and she then made a plan with her work and planned to stay in our house for 3 weeks. 
I was annoyed about this then the one day I video called my fianc√©, he was smoking and considering he had quit 6 months prior I was very angry and I know that his smoking was directly linked to having his family with them as they bring that side of him out (we have had our arguments and somewhat resolved them) and then after I had gotten back from my parents place (only ended up staying a week with them because I wanted my fianc√©s family out of our house) I found out that my mother in law had gotten weirdly personal with my fianc√© and was asking super inappropriate things and telling him he could talk to her about anything and it even went as far as talking about mine and my fianc√©s sex life which I am definitely not comfortable with. 
I also found out that his family had taken complete advantage of the situation and are basically everything in my house, we don‚Äôt struggle often but we were having a bad couple of months and to have three extra mouths to feed and not even offer to pay for anything pissed me off, she also open and drank my birthday present which was a bottle of alcohol and I‚Äôve asked for things to be replaced and I am yet to see anything come from it.

120,1f1foo8,AITA for serving my roommate's girlfriend‚Äôs leftovers at my dinner party without asking?,"Here's the situation: My roommate, Dave, has been dating this girl, Lisa, for a few months. Lisa is an amazing cook, and whenever she comes over, she whips up these incredible meals. The thing is, she always makes way too much food, and they leave a ton of leftovers in the fridge.

Now, Dave never eats the leftovers. I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say that every few days, I have to go through the fridge and clean out all the old food Lisa leaves behind because it just sits there until it starts to go bad.

A few weeks ago, I decided to throw a small dinner party for some friends. I‚Äôm not much of a cook, so I was getting stressed about what to serve. I thought, why not ask Lisa to help out? She‚Äôs always cooking at our place anyway, and I‚Äôve always complimented her food. So, I casually mentioned it to Dave, asking if Lisa might be cool with cooking for my party. Dave seemed a bit taken aback but said he‚Äôd ask her. The next day, he told me Lisa wasn‚Äôt comfortable with it because she didn‚Äôt want to feel like she was being taken advantage of. I was surprised but told him no problem, I‚Äôd figure something else out.

The night before the party, Lisa comes over and starts making dinner for her and Dave, as usual. I‚Äôm in the kitchen, hanging out with them, and mention that I‚Äôm still trying to figure out what to serve at my party the next day. Lisa doesn‚Äôt say much but continues cooking, and I notice she‚Äôs making a LOT of food ‚Äì way more than just for her and Dave.

After they finish eating, they leave the leftovers in the fridge. Given the history of these leftovers going uneaten and just taking up space until I have to clean them out, I get an idea. The next day, I take out the leftovers, heat them up, and serve them at my dinner party, along with a bean dip I made. My friends loved the food and kept complimenting me on how great it was. I just smiled and thanked them without giving too many details.

That night, Dave comes home, orders pizza, and goes to bed without even checking the fridge. Two days later (after Lisa has already come and cooked another dinner), he notices the leftovers are gone and asks me what happened to them. I tell him I used them for my party. He gets super mad and says I had no right to take the food Lisa made. I argued that it was just leftovers, and since they never eat them, I figured it was better than letting them go to waste.

Now, both Dave and Lisa are pretty pissed at me, saying it was a jerk move to ""steal"" her cooking for my party. I think they‚Äôre overreacting because it was just food that was going to end up in the trash otherwise.

I asked her about an opportunity that was presented to me by a publication but would cost and she said not to waste time with them.

She talked about the general benefits and made specific points about her org and the only other org in our industry that‚Äôs local. 

Both orgs are great, but I do already know a lot of the members of my mentors org. I was considering joining the other org first for this reason only. 

But I finally ripped the band-aid off and said something I had suspected for a while now: ‚ÄúI know you will be mad if I join the other org first.‚Äù She confirmed that she absolutely would be mad. Literally no shock there, so I cut to the chase: I want special privileges.

I told her even BEYOND asking, I want her to look out for me. I will participate, pay my dues, join committees, etc but I want her to throw me a bone here or there. I want the best mentor assignment, heads up on opportunities, scholarships, chances to lead projects, etc. 

I‚Äôve worked on her business with her clients, solo at times, for years. I‚Äôve been in charge of special events by her company so she can play host. (I‚Äôve actually assisted on events for this very org.) She used to introduce me as her right hand in my early years. 

I would have picked the other org, simply because I don‚Äôt know as many of them, and eventually joined both.

AITA for making this request for special privileges? 
",Asshole,2024-08-26,"AITA for requesting special privileges from my mentors  professional organization? My mentor of almost a decade heads an association she created in our industry. 

I asked her about an opportunity that was presented to me by a publication but would cost and she said not to waste time with them. Then she went on herself usual tangent that I need to join an association for more exposure. She talked about the general benefits and made specific points about her org and the only other org in our industry that‚Äôs local. 

Both orgs are great, but I do already know a lot of the members of my mentors org. I was considering joining the other org first for this reason only. 

But I finally ripped the band-aid off and said something I had suspected for a while now: ‚ÄúI know you will be mad if I join the other org first.‚Äù She confirmed that she absolutely would be mad. Literally no shock there, so I cut to the chase: I want special privileges.

126,1f1f6br,AITA for visibly carrying Narcan on my keychain?,"I (23f) live in a state that is currently plagued by the opioid / fentanyl epidemic (as many others). 

I also recently graduated from college and as such, have been in social settings that involve the use of dr*gs. I‚Äôve witnessed OD‚Äôs first hand and am quite knowledgeable and passionate about harm reduction. I thought it was wonderful to walk in a Student Center bathroom one day to discover that the University had bins of Narcan available for students / faculty / staff. 

I now work on that same college campus in an administrative role, but am often traveling around campus and interacting with students. I carry Narcan on me at all times (not specifically for the college setting but in ANY instance it may be needed) in the form of a hook on my keychain. 

Last week, I was running an event for students on campus and had my keychain clipped onto my belt loop. Midway through the event my coworker pulled me aside and told me I needed to remove my keychain from my belt and put it away in my bag immediately. I was confused at first, but she explained the small canister of Narcan hanging off my belt loop was alarming and could damage the reputation of our Department and staff. 

Initially, I figured I should just put it away. But the more I thought about it, I told her I was more comfortable keeping my keys where they are, not only for my own personal convenience (running around with boxes in my hands) but also the point of carrying Narcan was so it was available for anyone to use if needed. Also, if it were a true emergency, there was risk in wasting time to find it in my bag, forgetting I had it in a panic, etc. 

I explained this to her, and after a brief back and forth, we continued the event and everything went as planned. 

Now - I do see how I may be the asshole for visibly carrying Narcan at a work event on a campus while facing College students. 

BUT, not only do the benefits outweigh the risk, the University has literally started a Harm Reduction campaign encouraging students / staff on campus to carry Narcan in case of an emergency! If anything, I feel like this is something that should be less taboo and more normalized. I am not the sole representative of the University promoting harm reduction (and even if I was, I am firm in my belief that it is not a bad thing).

The pool wasn‚Äôt open yet and we decided to go to the trampoline park. It is important to note earlier that day we went to the mall, she had me buy her a summer fridays lipgloss and said she would pay me back when I go over to her pool, which was supposed to be friday. She was always pretty good about paying me back so i didn‚Äôt have a reason to say no.

I eventually unadded her on snap cause she wasn‚Äôt planning on paying me back. So she texts me on messages asking why I unadded her. I wrote an entire thing saying I don‚Äôt appreciate her using me for my money cause at this point it would of been 2 months since that day and she never even brought up inviting me to her trampoline park.

Because I wanted to continue to play with her like we were earlier then I was trying to talk to her but her other friends kept getting in the way and at this point they started calling me names like a ‚Äúp***phile‚Äù and ‚Äúkid toucher‚Äù ‚Äúfreak/weirdo‚Äù and other things I don‚Äôt want to type or ever repeat again I did tell her friends to ‚Äústfu‚Äù and I realize I was wrong for that so I do apologize. so I texted my friend. Hey, I think we should talk and then explain the whole situation like hey if you‚Äôre friends when it continue to call me these things and get upset when I tell them to ‚Äústfu‚Äù then they shouldn‚Äôt say these things to me or anybody else and act like it‚Äôs no big deal and laugh about it she didn‚Äôt respond and the messages went green so i know she blocked my number, she also blocked me on social media, so I can‚Äôt contact her through there and I‚Äôm super upset that this happened and her friends didn‚Äôt even acknowledge what they did was wrong some information I should have added earlier is I am autistic so what they said hurt more then what they thought and what she did deeply upset me this isn‚Äôt the first time this happened with friends but it hurts even more because i thought we were close but I guess not she didn‚Äôt even try to say something at all just blocked me on everything, I do hope I can explain to her why it upset me but I can‚Äôt, she‚Äôll believe them over me anyway.

 I (28F) flew into town for my little sister‚Äôs baby shower this weekend. This is the first baby of all the siblings. 

My sister and I have different dads and our 51 y/o mom‚Äôs divorce from her dad in 2016 was ugly. He passed away in 2022 from an accident leaving my sister absolutely devastated. About a year before his passing he met someone great who I‚Äôm going to call Jane. They didn‚Äôt work out but stayed close friends. Jane LOVES my sister and flew into town too. Our mom HATES Jane but had never met her. I had never met her either.

On the night I got in my mom worked until 8pm, so me, my sister, and Jane grabbed dinner. This morning we invited our mom to get coffee and meet Jane 1:1 before the shower. She was introduced to Jane and was incredibly cold even though Jane came into the intro with a great attitude. 

After the uncomfortable intro my sister asked our mom to take a second to reset. Our mom explained that her bad mood was because we didnt invite her out the night before. I pointed out that she worked late and wanted to avoid Jane as much as possible. She stated that she‚Äôd just leave the intro coffee since she ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt wanted,‚Äù and this set me off as that wasn‚Äôt abnormal behavior. Not my best moment and I feel terrible for being so curt, but I told her if she was going to act like that she could just leave. She did. She then texted us that she wouldn‚Äôt be going to the shower. She was true to her word and never came.

Tonight she texted us saying that she felt like Jane is putting a wedge between us and that she is heartbroken that no one wanted her at the shower.

He got the job, like immediately after stepping into the interview because of this connection. (I must add he is not proud of using this connection but he needed money.) 

So at this job, the work is super easy, like a toddler could do it. That‚Äôs not the issue. The issue is the coworkers. They are all nasty, foul mouth, disgusting humans. They are always talking about sleeping with peoples daughters because of how big their butt is and how it would feel up against their balls. They like to take their walkies and shove them up each others butts. It makes my boyfriend extremely uncomfortable. 

They have also lied to him. My boyfriend works night shift. He loves to stay up late and wake up late. They promised him the availability he had set and said they would never change it. They also said they don‚Äôt push rewards cards as hard as his other job. Both lies. They have scheduled him morning shifts every Sunday so far and have even told him he has to come in at 6am every so often. Instantly he‚Äôs mad. Also, he got written up in the two weeks he‚Äôs been there for not having anyone sign up for a rewards cards. 

He‚Äôs made it very clear that he isn‚Äôt comfortable with me going into his work and if I do, then I have to have him with me. 

Always, my family and friends all say IATA because I told him to hand back the write up and say no thanks I quit. He doesn‚Äôt have a back up but I make enough to support us both for at least two weeks. So, AITA for telling him to quit and walk out?

137,1f1dtw6,AITA for telling my mom how i really feel about her ,"**I (16f) told my mother (61f) how I really feel about her.**

For context, my parents divorced in 2014 because my dad (45m at the time) cheated on my mom (51f). I lived with my dad and started spending weekends at my mom's place in 2020. This summer, I stayed at my mom's for the month of July and a week in August as per the divorce agreement.

Today, while preparing to return to my dad's (who's on vacation,my step sis(20f is at home), my mom came to my room and asked if I wanted to stay longer. I declined, stating I had planned things. She then said, ""Eh, you never want to spend time here with me,"" and I reminded her about my month-long stay. She paused and asked, ""What am I to you?"" I replied, ""You're like a family member, but we don't have a mom-daughter relationship; I don't feel like I have a mom figure."" She wanted me to elaborate, so I mentioned that I have no memories of her from my childhood. She responded, somewhat defensively, asking if I was accusing her of abandoning me. I clarified that I was just expressing my feelings, but she took offense.

After some back-and-forth, I brought up two specific incidents: one in 2021, when she yelled at me after a restaurant visit, saying me and my dad's family should drown in the sea (which led me to see a therapist), and another at my grandmother's funeral when she insulted my appearance and yelled at me. She denied both incidents strongly, saying things like, ""I‚Äôd never say such things!"" and accused me of lying.

Despite my insistence that those events occurred, she accused me of saying awful things about her. When she started to cry and talked about her struggles having me, I felt uncertain about how to respond. Eventually, she asked if I felt any need to apologize, but I maintained that I was sorry she felt hurt, yet this was how I felt.

She said she wouldn't text me again and I left her house. Later, she called to ask if I meant what I said, and I confirmed I did. I didn‚Äôt respond to her texts because I was texting my girlfriend about everything. After I refused to have dinner invitation with her since i had plans, she then asked me if i felt ashamed and yelled at me claiming I had caused her pain.

Later, she sent me old Facebook videos of us together when i was a kid. Then, she called again, yelling that she would go to the police to sue my dad for child abandonment, claiming I wouldn't see him again and told me she was coming to talk to me. This triggered a panic attack, and I called my dad for support. He reassured me, saying there was nothing to worry about. I learned that I might not be my mom's bio child. We met up and she called my dad they argued and he told her to stop tormenting me and threatening me(of taking me away from my dad) she denied ever doing that and when i told her ""no you did it"" I left the situation.

My family of 4 (2 parents 2 older teenagers) had an event to attend and we were struggling to find someone to watch our 15 week old puppy. My oldest child suggested their boyfriend (19 yo) who has met the puppy numerous times and likes her a lot. We went to our event at 8am and returned at 2:30pm. We hadn't agreed upon an amount to pay and gave the bf $30. Later that day I got a text from my oldest saying that $30 wasn't enough for puppy-sitting. I immediately apologized and offered another $30 which they were happy with, but I'm feeling like I probably paid too much for a VERY easy job. AITA for feeling a little sore about this?

A few things for context. 
1. My child's bf works, but was not scheduled that day, and would have had to bring my kid over that morning at 7:30 anyway, so he wasn't going out of his way, not to mention that it is a 10 minute drive.
2. I regularly buy both of them groceries, take them to movies, lunch/dinner, and recently checked the battery on his car and bought everything necessary to clean off the corrosion and get the car running. I have never asked for them to pay anything, and never will.
3. The gig consisted of watching a very cute 6lb puppy who sleeps 14 hours a day and he didn't have to feed it, only take it out a few times. He did this from our air conditioned home with full access to myriad streaming services and a completely stocked refrigerator that he was allowed to eat anything from (and did so reasonably).
4. My child suggested their bf to pup-sit, but we still had many options left to explore, family and friends, who would have either happily accepted $30, or would have refused it.
5. My kid's bf offered us tickets that he got for free from friends to something we'll be attending later in the month, so the $60 comes to a wash (if we actually get the tickets). I'm just trying to figure out how I should feel about all of this in principle.
6. I'm not angry, I love my kid and I like their boyfriend, I just feel weird and uncomfortable about the whole thing.

140,1f1dc9g,AITAH for asking my husband not to move his mom in with us.,"This is killing me. I'm caring for both my parents in our home- mom with advanced alzheimers and dad with early dementia. I made a conscious decision to not work while i'm caring for my parents. I use their money wisely for their care but i don't pay myself. My husband who is working wants to move her mom in with us so we can care for her. His mom other than being a drama queen (over her blood sugar level and blood pressure) is independent. I'm conflicted because his mom has a tendency to turn her kids against each other. She once lived with her youngest daughter but because she didn't her daughter's husband decided to complaint to her older daughter that she was unfairly treated. Older daughter called APS on the younger daughter and caused a lot of inconvenience and headache - APS did not find anything bad. I know my husband has every right to bring his mom over and I don't want him to turn his back on his mom (after all I'm caring for both my parents in our house and my husband and been beyond helpful with my parents) but I don't have the patience or energy to care for another elderly (certainly not my drama queen mother in law). I told my husband I will not tolerate his mom complaining to his siblings about our home or the way we live our lives and I will lash back at them, including him. I don't want drama around my parents. I'm concerned my MIL will cry for attention all the time and when she doesn't get the attention she will complain.

I'm caring for both my parents in our home- mom with advanced alzheimers and dad with early dementia. I made a conscious decision to not work while i'm caring for my parents. I use their money wisely for their care but i don't pay myself. My husband who is working wants to move her mom in with us so we can care for her. His mom other than being a drama queen (over her blood sugar level and blood pressure) is independent. I'm conflicted because his mom has a tendency to turn her kids against each other. She once lived with her youngest daughter but because she didn't her daughter's husband decided to complaint to her older daughter that she was unfairly treated. Older daughter called APS on the younger daughter and caused a lot of inconvenience and headache - APS did not find anything bad. I know my husband has every right to bring his mom over and I don't want him to turn his back on his mom (after all I'm caring for both my parents in our house and my husband and been beyond helpful with my parents) but I don't have the patience or energy to care for another elderly (certainly not my drama queen mother in law). I told my husband I will not tolerate his mom complaining to his siblings about our home or the way we live our lives and I will lash back at them, including him. I don't want drama around my parents. I'm concerned my MIL will cry for attention all the time and when she doesn't get the attention she will complain.

AITA for not wanting to help my wife clean our homeschool classroom for the 4th year in a row?

My wife stays at home with our kids and teaches. She was a professional teacher before she became a mother. She is an awesome wife and mother. She teaches, maintains the household, cleans etc‚Ä¶

I must admit at times I have somewhat taken her incredible care of us for granted. I‚Äôm a man and by nature not always receptive to her feelings. I get in that regard we just suck sometimes. 

Here‚Äôs my defense. I work 6 days a week. Hours varies between 60-80 hours. I have my regular 6 days a week job and I also do side work to keep money flowing. We have done pretty good at maintaining a comfortable lifestyle for our kids and us.
I work this much proudly to provide for my family. I believe my wife sacrifices a good amount for our children and they deserve the very best I can provide.

This is where it gets tricky. My wife has been dragging for the last few years an unnecessary amount of school supplies. They were in our old house after she left her job. Then stored in her brothers attic while we moved for my job. Then moved to our new homes garage and eventually up to the classroom. She has put off the purge of these supplies. This summer we moved our daughter upstairs to a room across from the bonus classroom area. The room she moved into was a guest room that had furniture and other storage stuff. We have since gotten rid of all of that stuff. In the time we were making the transition some stuff that was supplies had to be moved back into the classroom. Last weekend I spent a couple hours with her getting the classroom somewhat more manageable. The kids have not been in school for summertime. Most of the summer was filled with activities and projects and other life events. Projects like moving daughter‚Äôs room, moving my 5 year old into her old room. Painting, cleaning etc‚Ä¶ She did everything but get her classroom back in order. 

School starts this week and I had an especially long work week and I‚Äôm tired!! I worked over 80 hours this week and my 1 day off is Sunday. Well I usually let her give me a honey to do list on Sundays to help things get caught up and set her up for her week to come. She‚Äôs got a lot on her plate with kids, making sure house isn‚Äôt destroyed, carting them around to activities, appointments, grocery shopping etc‚Ä¶. This weekend however I hit a wall. After 12 years of marriage and her dragging all this stuff around from house to house, closet to closet, attic to garage I had enough. I‚Äôve bought her wine for her to settle and overcome this classroom. I just wasn‚Äôt going to deal with it anymore. So she now has threatened our marriage and that this was the final straw. 

I have made mistakes in our marriage and they have never been betrayal type level mistakes or anything like that. I regard myself as decent hardworking person. I‚Äôm not perfect but I‚Äôm always present and trying.

AITA for just not doing anything else?



Update‚Ä¶.. We have since both apologized for each other‚Äôs expectations of our desired behavior. We have agreed to just start throwing shit away to get back to an organized state and less chaos. I also admitted to posting about it to seek clarity on my own actions. She was not excited about it but obviously understood that I care enough to know if I‚Äôm out of line. We also agree that I need to slow down on side work to be around for the kids. Anyways we came to the conclusion we were both assholes.

2. Her house is a borderline hoarder situation. There are no safe places for our daughter to play where she can‚Äôt get into something that she could choke on or hurt herself with.

3. She has little regard for safety and always leaves knives, glass cups, cleaning products, and medications on tables where our daughter can easily reach them. She also tries to put jewelry on our toddler sometimes but doesn‚Äôt realize how much of a choking hazard this is. 

I really do love my MIL and I feel guilty not allowing her more time with her only grandchild, but I just don‚Äôt want to risk my child‚Äôs safety.

Lately, we've been having issues getting our closing chores and tasks done on time as we've been seeing more and more customers come in during our last hour of being open. Usually I wouldn't mind the extra business, but having this influx of people empties our soda fridge and chip rack, dirties the lobby, and generally undoes all the cleaning we've done during our slow time. Customers will even sit and eat in the lobby to and through closing,  which delays is further. I understand that this is part of the job, but the current schedule makes it so we send someone home at 8 (1 hour before closing) leaving only 2 people to assist the late rush of customers, redo the work we've already done, and also do the closing checklist before our scheduled clock out time. My boss thinks that we're just complaining, moving too slow, and are trying to pad our paychecks; but he also is adamant that customers don't see us closing the store or cleaning, which limits the work we can do at any given time. For instance,  if customers are eating,  we can't sweep the lobby, and if someone's ordering, we can't have any sanitizer buckets visible. So we end up stockpiling a list of chores that can't be done until after the customers leave it the store is closed, which can be overwhelming when you only have 2 people on shift. My solution, was to stop having the 3rd closer leave at 8, and to adjust by taking someone off the mid-shift during shift change, when it's slow and there's less side work that needs to be finished, but he refuses.

Now let me be clear, I don't want him to be berated by assholes or rude customers,  I just want to coordinate a few families and regulars to conveniently want our food on a night that he closes. Then after a few shifts like this, he'll understand where we're coming from and shift around the schedule a bit to accommodate the late rushes and crazy closing chore list. I've already run it by a few of my other coworkers and many said that they'd be OK working a few insane closing shifts if it meant we got a better schedule in the longrun, but others said that I'd be a petty asshole who should just leave it be and stuck it up. So I ask you, Reddit. Would I be the asshole?",0.0,1.0515356063842773,1,0

I get a text from ruby at 5pm asking if he called back which he didn‚Äôt so i ended up setting up this thing with Uber so that he will call her instead of me. THIS IS when the problem happened. I get a text from susie a couple mins after asking if I got in contact with the driver and I told her everything and then she said that ruby is crying because she thinks everyone is ignoring her texts and I was confused because I already did then susie says that she‚Äôs been crying from 12am and I said I contacted them as soon as I could.

150,1f1bm8c,AITA for breaking my boyfriend‚Äôs trust?,"I (17F) and my boyfriend (18M) have been dating for almost a year. Recently we have gotten into our most serious argument yet, after he found out I lied to him about who I was calling.

For context, my boyfriend and I work at the same establishment because of connections with management. I work as a host with two other coworkers who happen to be guys around my age (17M). My boyfriend works in the back, working independently most of the time. Around a month ago, we got into an argument because he thought I was being too friendly with my coworkers. I genuinely think I am a very friendly person, I‚Äôm not flirtatious nor touchy, but I do like treating people the way I‚Äôd like to be treated. I love complimenting others and smiling, which is the main reason I was put at the front. Anyway, my boyfriend saw my coworker throwing a napkin at me playfully and the other taking pictures on my phone. My boyfriend thinks I gave them the confidence to play around playfully with me, therefore, I‚Äôm being too friendly. He says joking around/talking about unrelated work topics are too friendly. At the end of the argument, he apologized and said he should trust me more while I agreed to tone down the jokes and conversations I have with the coworkers. 

Fast forward to Sunday, I was super tired from working three days in a row and was kinda portraying it through my attitude. I told my boyfriend I was tired and went to the front to work. In the morning, I decided to play a prank on my assistant manager (16M, who I think my boyfriend is okay with me being friendly because he‚Äôs gay) and call the establishment pretending I was a customer. However, one of the other hosts I work with answered instead. Knowing he picked up, I went ahead with the prank. When my boyfriend saw me on the phone laughing and asked who I was calling, I lied and said I pranked our assistant manager whom has pranked me twice before. We then took a break outside with the assistant manager. My boyfriend asked him if he liked the prank, but he didn‚Äôt respond. I then quickly decided to change the subject. I know it‚Äôs unjustifiable, but I felt immense guilt after I lied to him. My conscience repeated that it‚Äôs better to tell him now than never, yet I decided not to, afraid he‚Äôd get upset at me.

On Wednesday, my boyfriend talked to the assistant manager, who revealed I didn‚Äôt prank him, but pranked the other host instead. Ever since then, my boyfriend has been understandably upset with me and tells me I‚Äôve made him feel ‚Äústupid‚Äù for overthinking and that it‚Äôs hard for him to trust me again. He says ‚Äúif you lie for something small, what stops you from lying for something bigger?‚Äù I‚Äôve apologized so many times and promised him I‚Äôll change and put his feelings above all. I promised to not be friendly to other guys, even if it hurts their feelings.

151,1f1bm0v,AITA for indirectly making my crush stop expressing himself without him realizing it and then fighting him about it?,"Me (M17), my crush, R (M17), his childhood friend, N (F17), and his childhood friend's girlfriend, E (F17) are in a theater troupe. We work at E's late grandfather's amusement park and we (the troupe) only recently got together after a series of disagreements where I ended up yelling at N, and R ended up telling me I wouldn't be able to reach my goal to defend N. He left, thinking that it wouldn't work, and me, N, and E put on a show to convince him that it would.

Anyways, we're still getting used to things, and we recently started working on our halloween show. R is an inventor who makes amazing robots, and he recently made one that would drag me into the ground (it's a zombie-themed show.)  The robot did its job and dragged me down into a hole in the stage, but we forgot that there was a drop. I fell and got hurt, and he (presumably) felt guilty and thought it was his fault.

Usually, R has wild ideas and ropes me into them. I agree, and we always make it work. He's our director, and I'm the lead actor. But after I fell, I noticed how he turned away from riskier things that he usually would enthusiastically suggest and I was confused. After practice, I confronted him and asked why he was acting so weird and he was confused and asked what I meant. It devolved into a shouting match and we ended up agitating N and E in the process. R ran off and I felt really guilty.

We went and talked to our mentor/stage manager, K (25M). He helped us realize what was going on.

For further context, R had a very rough time a couple years ago. People would ridicule him for his robots and ideas, and he was an outcast. He was also very depressed and even worse. He had cut off contact with N, his childhood friend as well as his neighbor, because he didn't want to rope her into his issues. He actually only talked to her again when I brought up the troupe and he asked if she could have a job as well (N is a singer with anxiety and he wanted to help her.)

K told us how he might be unintentionally regressing back to the behavior from middle school and thinking that we would leave him if his robots/ideas didn't work.

I'm going to try to talk to him, but I felt really guilty and wanted to know whether I was an asshole. How am I going to ask him out if I was an asshole?

152,1f1bc82,AITA for declining my sister‚Äôs friend request after unfriending me twice?,"I (F34) don't want to accept my sister's (F37) friend request, at least for now.

I have been no contact with my sister for the last few months. For a bit of context, we (parents & I) closed our family business (of which my sister is not a part of) a few months ago. It was an extremely high stress situation in which bankruptcy was my biggest fear. Since October last year, I have been unravelling mentally.

With help of my partner (M38) I started to open my eyes to toxic and dysfunctional traits of my family members. I had to distance myself for a bit to stop codependency and feeling responsible for their fate.

Things came to a head during Christmas when we chose to stay home, which was the first time ever. Neither of us wished each other a merry Christmas. Some messages were exchanged after about how hurt they were. I explained several times said I just needed space and didn't appreciate being guilt tripped. They blamed how much I had changed on my partner, and expressed concerns about red flags they saw in him. 

She ended up unfriending me and my partner, and my mom did the same. 

A few months later we reconnected over the birth of my niece and my own daughter. She and my mom re-added me. 

Then a few weeks ago, I declined going to an event my sister invited me to. I was feeling extremely stressed about my family's future due to the looming bankruptcy because of the business. She lost it because she took it as if we do go bankrupt I don't want to see my family anymore, which wasn't true. I didn't feel compelled to defend myself though, because I was actively trying to break the pattern of grovelling every time she blows up in an emotional tirade, assuming things without waiting to hear the full story.

She said she wasn't going to bother with me anymore, that she would just keep us as friends on Facebook, but that's about it. Then shortly after, she unfriended me, again.

Fast forward to a week ago, she messaged me that she misses me and said all is forgotten and wants our kids grow up together. I told her I miss her too, but that my boundary about not talking bad about my partner stands firm. 

She then re-added me on Facebook. My partner told me that this is where I need make a change. If I keep accepting her friend requests, she's going to do it over and over again when things don't go her way. So I declined.

She asked me why I did that and says she feels like she's walking on eggshells around me. I told her she unfriended me twice in the last few months, after she explicitly said she wouldn't do that anymore, and that's why I don't want to re-add her, for now. 

She said that this is not going to work.

Now I feel like the a-hole who is standing in the way of repairing the relationship over a friend request.
