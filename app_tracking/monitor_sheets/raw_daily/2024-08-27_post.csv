0,1f2lnv6,WIBTA for not going to grandpa's celebration of life,"Me 21f, my mom invited me to my her dad's celebration of life and I'm not sure if I want to go, the last two times I seen him was good. The first was a family vacation where he didn't look good but it was fun, and the second was in the hospital when he was on his deathbed. I feel very comfortable with where I left things with him and we were never too too close, I came out to him as trans at the first visit and he never really said anything either. The celebration of life is 4 hours away and we're staying for 3 days with a very big family. Without saying too much there was lots of family drama which I'm on the side that my family doesn't like, we just see everything very differently, and the drive with my mother both ways I already know will be terrible, she can be very judgement and makes me uncomfortable when she smokes weed and drives. Tldr I don't want to go because I know I won't be happy and I just feel like I'd be happier at home. Am I the asshole?

1,1f2bttm,AITA for not letting my daughter have contact with my sister? ,"AITAH for not letting my daughter have contact with my sister? 

I have 2 daughters, Stella (16) and Nora (almost 13). Stella is transgender, AMAB and came out about two years ago. When she was born, I had major complications following the delivery and had to have an emergency surgery that left me unable to have more kids. It was an incredibly dark time for my husband and I. My older sister Kristy saw us grieving and told us that in time she would be happy to carry a baby for us if thatâ€™s what we wanted. After a lot of work in therapy we both got to a place where we were ready to have another child. We did IVF to create the embryo that would become Nora, transferred it into Kristy, and Kristy carried our daughter and birthed her. It was a wonderful experience and Kristy naturally ended up becoming very close to Nora from a very young age having been her surrogate.

When Stella came out 2 years ago, Kristy was not very accepting. She wasnâ€™t rude to Stella but she told us she thought Stella was too young to make that decision herself. Eventually she seemed to start to come around to the idea, however she soon had a massive political shift and became very conservative. She would post about how parents of transgender kids are abusive and there are only two genders among other issues. 

As Kristyâ€™s behavior hasnâ€™t improved, we made the difficult decision to cut off all contact with her. Nora was particularly devastated and still is. She gives me a hard time about it all the time. She says Kristy never said anything negative about Stella being transgender. I do believe that but I donâ€™t want Nora being around someone who is hateful towards her sister. She is still a child and I am the one who makes decisions. Nora asked if she can have scheduled phone calls with Kristy and I said no. She asked if she can schedule a lunch with her and I told her not right now. She has a phone that I monitor and she told me she wants to reach out to Kristy so badly. She said she really misses her and their bond and that she wants to have her in her life. I personally think it will be hurtful to Stella if theyâ€™re close and itâ€™s not something I want to have in our lives. Nora says she feels like there is a void in her life not being able to talk to the person who carried her.

AITA? I feel bad for Nora but at the same time I donâ€™t want a blatantly transphobic person in our life. I think it could really hurt Stella and Nora may not be mature to comprehend that. However on the other side, I know the bond between surrogate and child is very strong and even more so with her being an aunt. I donâ€™t know what the right thing is.
