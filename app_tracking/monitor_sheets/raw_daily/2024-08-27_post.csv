0,1f2lnv6,WIBTA for not going to grandpa's celebration of life,"Me 21f, my mom invited me to my her dad's celebration of life and I'm not sure if I want to go, the last two times I seen him was good. The first was a family vacation where he didn't look good but it was fun, and the second was in the hospital when he was on his deathbed. I feel very comfortable with where I left things with him and we were never too too close, I came out to him as trans at the first visit and he never really said anything either. The celebration of life is 4 hours away and we're staying for 3 days with a very big family. Without saying too much there was lots of family drama which I'm on the side that my family doesn't like, we just see everything very differently, and the drive with my mother both ways I already know will be terrible, she can be very judgement and makes me uncomfortable when she smokes weed and drives. Tldr I don't want to go because I know I won't be happy and I just feel like I'd be happier at home. Am I the asshole?

1,1f2bttm,AITA for not letting my daughter have contact with my sister? ,"AITAH for not letting my daughter have contact with my sister? 

I have 2 daughters, Stella (16) and Nora (almost 13). Stella is transgender, AMAB and came out about two years ago. When she was born, I had major complications following the delivery and had to have an emergency surgery that left me unable to have more kids. It was an incredibly dark time for my husband and I. My older sister Kristy saw us grieving and told us that in time she would be happy to carry a baby for us if that’s what we wanted. After a lot of work in therapy we both got to a place where we were ready to have another child. We did IVF to create the embryo that would become Nora, transferred it into Kristy, and Kristy carried our daughter and birthed her. It was a wonderful experience and Kristy naturally ended up becoming very close to Nora from a very young age having been her surrogate.

When Stella came out 2 years ago, Kristy was not very accepting. She wasn’t rude to Stella but she told us she thought Stella was too young to make that decision herself. Eventually she seemed to start to come around to the idea, however she soon had a massive political shift and became very conservative. She would post about how parents of transgender kids are abusive and there are only two genders among other issues. 

As Kristy’s behavior hasn’t improved, we made the difficult decision to cut off all contact with her. Nora was particularly devastated and still is. She gives me a hard time about it all the time. She says Kristy never said anything negative about Stella being transgender. I do believe that but I don’t want Nora being around someone who is hateful towards her sister. She is still a child and I am the one who makes decisions. Nora asked if she can have scheduled phone calls with Kristy and I said no. She asked if she can schedule a lunch with her and I told her not right now. She has a phone that I monitor and she told me she wants to reach out to Kristy so badly. She said she really misses her and their bond and that she wants to have her in her life. I personally think it will be hurtful to Stella if they’re close and it’s not something I want to have in our lives. Nora says she feels like there is a void in her life not being able to talk to the person who carried her.

AITA? I feel bad for Nora but at the same time I don’t want a blatantly transphobic person in our life. I think it could really hurt Stella and Nora may not be mature to comprehend that. However on the other side, I know the bond between surrogate and child is very strong and even more so with her being an aunt. I don’t know what the right thing is.

But for the past few months Ive done small things around the house, clean up here and there. But apparently cleaning a few things a few times a week isn't enough. I have very bad depression, anxiety, and a condition called POTS. Plus right now I'm sick. 


Just about 30 minutes ago my mom came in my room and got upset I forgot to clean a plate. Saying how much she did when she was 12 and my age. Then started talking about my abusive dad and how he did nothing around the house and would yell at her. 

I'm not saying I do everything. I don't. But I don't sit on my ass everyday and not do anything and yell at her like he did. I do stuff when I can. The days I feel like I can actually stand up and feel my legs or get out of bed without crying about literally anything. 

She told me I either do stuff around the house or I'm paying someone to do it. As well as she knows I have bad mental health but I have days I feel good. Yes I do. But the days I do feel good I want to go out and act like a normal kid who isn't suffering from a disability or mental issues. 

I talk to my therapist a lot about it and we're trying to figure out why I plan on doing things and then don't. Because I have 0 clue. She believes it's the depression and we're going to be talking about that and hopefully getting me on meds that work. 

I try my best around here as a kid who deals with a lot. As my therapist says I've lived through a lot. I won't get into it though. I have tried to talk to my mom about this. About how I try my best around here with everything going on with my body. But she won't listen to anything I have to say.

8,1f2un9w,AITA for telling my friend to stop talking about his wife because I don't like how he might view her?,"My (30F) friend (33M) is one of the kindest, most supportive friends I've ever had.

Unfortunately, I think the way he views his wife (29F) whom he adores might align with this part of him, which is why I've recently told him stop talking to me about her.

They have a toxic ""hot-and-cold"" relationship where she often withdraws affection, becomes cold to him, and he pursues her -- another name for this is ""intermittent reinforcement"". Because he's so distressed by this cycle and absolutely adores her, many hours of our conversations together center on talking about her to help him understand her better. I've been very sympathetic and supportive so far, but as of a few weeks ago I started feeling uneasy. For some context, other mutual friends have already told him his relationship is unhealthy and that they're no longer willing to help him with it because it's too emotionally laborious and exhausting.

I think what made me start feeling uneasy was that I sensed he may be idealizing her in an unhealthy way, possibly as his manic pixie dream girl given how he describes her. Both he and his wife are extremely hardworking and conventionally attractive, his wife in a way that's pretty much put on a pedestal where we are (Silicon Valley). I'm pretty tired of seeing that mold glorified, which normally I can handle except when it's deliberately being rubbed in my face every single time I see this friend. He says he's mainly obsessed with her because she aggressively pursued him, was (initially) very supportive of him, and has ""uncommon interests for a girl"". While this seems valid, a comment that raised alarm bells was when he bragged about ""I got the girl dudes gave me high-fives for"" and ""I always show her off"".

Due to my friend's recent immature behavior (outside his relationship) and the above comments, I started losing sympathy for his love for his wife. Our convos have made realize that I haven't experienced my own romantic partners believing in me and adoring me the way he does for his wife, and that she had many advantages in life that I lacked. This makes me really sad -- normally I'm happy for other people receiving love and privilege no matter how lacking I feel, but it doesn't hit as positively with those things are being rubbed in my face for hours.

I recently drew some boundaries on how much my friend could discuss his wife with me ""because I'm struggling with my own life too much"", which he blatantly broke twice. After the second time, I pretty much got angry with him, sent ""make it stop"" gifs, and said ""never talk about her again"". I apologized, but he's been upset and relatively cold ever since.

9,1f2ugq4,WIBTA if I started setting boundaries with my best friend getting tattoos for free from me?,"Me 21/F and my best friend 22/F have been friends since she started working where I was currently working at. I wasn’t tattooing other people outside family, because I wasn’t comfortable enough. She insisted on getting one and we would trade our services, she gets a tattoo and she’d dye my hair. 

After I had done 2 and a half tattoos for her, the third was was half done because we both had quit at different times and our schedules never matched. There were times she would text me 3-4 times a day, if I didn’t respond. My mental health took a toll after not working after a while, because work was my getaway from home. I still live with my dad, and my brother when he comes home in the weekends. They drain me a lot, and I want to move but cant due to the job situation. 
Anyway she would text me everyday and I’d just half swipe her messages. They were always like: 

Hey do you do you think we could finish my tattoo this weekend? 
If you’re down dude?
Heyy??
????
Are you free Saturday??
Dude can we finish the tattoo and I was thinking about another one if you can do it please? 
??
???

It was along the lines of that for a whole week straight, I was drained for a while before I had quit but she was making it worse. 

Fast forward I finally finished her tattoo, and she was already talking about another one. With being out of work and not having money, my supplies are running low. She doesn’t have a job either, but her boyfriend does and he’s paid for hers before but from a tattoo shop. 

I would do it, but I want to charge her since she’s never asked me for if I want my hair dyed yet. I don’t want to sound desperate for a hair service but getting it dyed professionally is expensive. And I have gave her three tattoos for free, I was just giving her the benefit of the doubt on asking me first. 

She recently texted me about wanting a new one, the tattoo is pretty big and has color. Color is very expensive, and on my post there were prices I set. But she never stated in her text she’d pay for it. I want to charge her but don’t know how to make it sound nice, and I don’t know if she is really my friend or just using me for tattoos. Because she doesn’t text me much, until she wants one done.

11,1f2ubrb,AITA for getting fed up with my boyfriend’s obsession with this one particular music group?,"
My boyfriend has a strong passion for one dance/electronic/hip hop artist. When we first met, he tried to get me interested, and although it wasn’t my cup of tea, I was supportive. I even bought my own tickets to concerts to attend with him to show interest. I liked a few of their songs and didn’t mind listening to them together.

However, over the years, his obsession has consumed almost every aspect of his life. We now live together, and our apartment is covered in posters from the artist's shows. He spends weekends traveling to their concerts, often taking time off work for them. He frequently buys hundreds of dollars worth of merchandise at a time- hoodies, hats, blankets, t-shirts, completely random shit, but when it comes to spending on us or our time together, he won’t make the same effort.

His obsession extends to our daily life. The apartment is filled with his merch- aside from the posters, there are band blankets all over our furniture, and he constantly plays the artist's music in our living room. I can’t make the bed and decorate it nicely with my blankets without him throwing one of his on top. Even when we go on trips, he prefers to listen to this artist for hours. He’ll listen to replays of shows and has memorized time stamps for his favorite parts. His response to my complaints is that I should just listen to my own music with headphones. I feel overwhelmed and trapped by the constant presence of this artist's music.

Recently, after a weekend at one of the artist’s shows, I hoped we could spend some quality time together. Instead, he spent the evening rewatching the show and engaging in an artist-focused Facebook group for fans. I feel like my needs and preferences are being ignored, and I’m growing resentful because my efforts to be understanding haven’t been reciprocated. He absolutely does not compromise on music whenever he’s driving us somewhere, but asks me to play “mutual” music in my car. We work down the street from each other and have the same hours and can’t even carpool because I can’t tolerate this artist any longer and he’s not willing to compromise. 

I’ve tried discussing my feelings with him, but he doesn’t seem to care. I’m not considering ending the relationship yet, but his obsession is causing tension and frustration.

13,1f2tzei,AITA: Got into an argument with my girlfriend over her photography project.,"Hey guys currently sleeping in the spare room due to an argument I had with my girlfriend of 1yr+

My girlfriend is studying photography at an arts college and is working on a presentation for street photography. 

Before returning to uni myself I was professional photographer for four years shooting weddings. So I do have opinions on the medium.

She decided to do her street photography project on the local homeless population in our city. I glanced over her shoulder to see photos of homeless people holding signs asking for money on her laptop. When asked she told me they weren’t aware that their photo was taken.

After that I gave my opinion on how unethical that was. In brief my points were:

- She was using homeless people as props.

- It’s not ok to take photos of people in vulnerable situations.

- That the art didn’t say anything outside of just being photos of homeless people.

She got very upset and I didn’t realise how much this project meant to her. She started crying and telling me that she was indeed trying to advocate for these people through her art.

I do feel bad that she got upset as I do care about her. 

But I want to stand by what I said at the same time. That is unethical to take photos of homeless people without their consent. They are powerless and photography like that just uses them as props.

Anyways I feel like I know the answer already if I was being an asshole. But I would also appreciate the minds of reddit providing me with their opinions.

Thank you for reading!

Edit: Was not expecting this traction. Also was not expecitng so many people telling me I'm not the asshole. In truth things got heated quickly and the tone of my communications was very atagonistic. But Isuppose it's hard not to be when discussing sensitive issues like this.

I think that has something to do with the fact I really do care about her feelings and don't want her to stop doing photography or showing me her work because of this incident. She has been passionate about photography for a long time and finally decided to pursue it after meeting me. I don't want her to feel like I'm shitting all over her work.

I still stand by what I said that the behaviour was not ok and highly unethical. But I want to be able to communicate that in a way that doesn't discourage her from doing photography.

Last night was probably not the best time to do that. We were both rushing to meet the deadlines for our individual assingments, and things got very heated very quickly

Would love to know some ways that I can approach the topic again.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-27,"AITA: Got into an argument with my girlfriend over her photography project. Hey guys currently sleeping in the spare room due to an argument I had with my girlfriend of 1yr+

 I asked my mum to talk to him about it, and instead she called him saying she has a boyfriend ""that they know very well"" since 9 months, so she didn't have space to welcome me.
 I was the only one at the house so I
had to face him telling my version of the story, even throught he seemed hurt he accepted it. 

Then hesend us a message at 4am to me and my siblings that he felt sad and betrayed, that we ""chose our team"". He wants to kick me and my sister out of the house without mercy, and told me ""you will to to your mothers house with your new father""

I don't even know what to do anymore, pls send support.

As the last one of the family, I needed to know where will 1 live with,and nobody seemed open to welcome me, as my dad wanted my mum to take more care of me, and my mum didn't have the space for me.
 I asked my mum to talk to him about it, and instead she called him saying she has a boyfriend ""that they know very well"" since 9 months, so she didn't have space to welcome me.
 I was the only one at the house so I
had to face him telling my version of the story, even throught he seemed hurt he accepted it. 

Then hesend us a message at 4am to me and my siblings that he felt sad and betrayed, that we ""chose our team"". He wants to kick me and my sister out of the house without mercy, and told me ""you will to to your mothers house with your new father""

I don't even know what to do anymore, pls send support.

16,1f2to9c,AITA for pulling out of a trip as I have to make my own way there without my friends,"So we have a trip planned where someone has invited our friend group to their holiday home ( 4 girls including me, and 5 guys) out of town. It’s not too far (around 4 hour drive) and so it’s just for a short trip / weekend. 

For context, we’re all at the age where we’ve finished uni, some people including my girlfriends went travelling and some people are working, including myself. The persons whose home it is said we can come anytime and stay however long we like from weds-Sunday. 

I spoke with the girls and they asked if I was taking days off work, and I said I could drive us up Thursday evening after work as I work from home on Fridays anyway so can just log on on Friday whilst out there as Fridays are usually very chill, so no days off. They said Thursday evening is fine and they’re happy to do that, as I’m the only one who drives / has a car. So this was the plan. 

One of the girls has now said she can actually take her dads car and she doesn’t work yet, and neither do the rest of the girls, and said she’s going to drive up in the morning on Thursday if we wanted to get in her dads car. I said I obviously can’t go in the day, as haven’t taken that day off, and one of the girls, let’s just call her Megan, said Thursday evening is still better for her and so she’ll come with me then and the other two to drive up Thursday in the morn. 

She’s now messaged me, bearing in mind it’s Tuesday, 2 days away from the trip, saying she’s now decided to go with the other girls on Thursday in the day as her boyfriend isn’t coming to see her so she would just be doing nothing during the day now. I’m annoyed because it means I now have to do that 4 hour drive by myself in the dark after work, where I would be tired after a long day in the office and no one to keep me company, plus the extra cost of petrol as I can’t split it anymore. (I could go Friday eve after workbut it’s the same situation , and Saturday only means I have one night there which seems a waste) 

So I’ve got annoyed and said well if that’s the situation I don’t want to come anymore and I’m a bit frustrated that they’ve changed the plans and now left me to make the journey on my own. They’ve said to me I’m being difficult overreacting and it’s not a big deal, and to just drive up on my own and someone will come with me on the drive home. 

I think it’s unfair as they’ve changed the plans so last minute as I potentially could’ve got Thursday off work if I knew in advance, but now it’s too short notice, but they’re acting like I’m being the asshole for now not wanting to go, as we haven’t been able to do a trip together for ages.

18,1f2tit3,AITA for leaving a road trip early?,"A new friend I met through a 12-step program (NOT SUBSTANCE BASED) was trying to get her car across the country. With little support from her friends & family, I agreed to help her make the trip from MA to Kansas City where I would fly back & she would continue to CA.

I was able to get time off of work to help her. I took Friday off from my 9-5 & found coverage for my weekend shifts doing overnight pet care (24-hour shifts on Sat & Sun)
Before leaving I told her about the medications I take, which includes THC/CBD, & that I vape nic. We planned this trip for 2 weeks & nothing was finalized until 2 days before departure.

While we planned to leave Friday morning, we didn't leave MA until almost 8 pm & she said she wanted to drive.
On Friday night, she asked me not to vape in her car anymore. She said the smell was bothering her and, since she didn't let her dad smoke cigs in her car because of the smell, asked I not vape. She also added on tacitly that she had esophageal cancer, which had never been mentioned before. Agreeing to the reasonable request, I put my vapes away and we continued along. 
*Mind you, I don't vape heavily.. maybe 1-3 puffs every 30 min. 

Saturday morning I did my normal routine, including taking my medications. Upon getting to the car, she stated she wanted to drive again. I asked if she was sure, & she stated that since I had consumed cannabis that morning at 7 am, she didn't want me to drive her car yet & around 12 that we could swap driving. 

As the day went on, she refused to let me drive.. saying that I was still inebriated, even though I didn't consume anything since that morning. We made very few stops & basically only ate gas station food our entire trip. Any attempts I made to ""co-pilot"" (ie, adjusting temperatures, doing GPS, music selection, etc) were shut down rather rudely, as if to say ""don't touch my things"". 
Around 4 pm, I decided to close my eyes in an attempt to will away the migraine that was developing as my jaw clenched from a lack of nicotine and the frustration that I was seemingly wasting my time.

Around 6 pm, we stopped in OH for a bathroom break. At this stop, we both got out of the vehicle, she went inside, & I went to the backseat to grab my wallet before going in. Upon entering the bathroom, she frantically shouts out saying I have to go back to the car because she didn't lock it. I left the bathroom & stood watch outside of the car, waiting for my turn to go inside. 
When she came out of the building she grabbed her phone from the car, shouted ""I can't do this anymore!"" before locking the car & walking away to make a phone call. 

At this point, I immediately started planning my return trip home. I eventually got my things from her car and booked a Lyft to the airport. I spent all of Saturday night and most of Sunday in the Columbus airport before finally making my way home. I tried making peace via text about a week later with no response.

For a while now, I have gone through several 21st plans that have all been rejected by my Grandma. My initial plan was that since my birthday is happening around the time of the Ren Faire, I'd get all my friends and I to dress up as our DND characters, drink ale and have fun at the Faire. My Grandma rejected this idea because I'd be drinking around a large group of people, and she's convinced I'll end up so drunk I'll be taken advantage of and murdered by a Jester at the Faire. 

My second birthday idea was to have a video game themed birthday party, where everyone would show up dressed as their favorite video game character. I'd get a Black Forest Cake (Portal 2) and we'd have “a rum and Nuka Cola” (from Fallout; got the recipe from the official Fallout cookbook). Grandma rejected the idea because she thinks birthdays after you're 18 should be “sophisticated”, and games aren't sophisticated to her at all. 

My third and final idea was to have all my friends come over for a sleepover, where we watch “The Room” + “ The Disaster Artist” and take sips of wine each time a funny moment happens. Grandma rejected this idea because again, I'd be drinking with a large group of people, so she's 100% convinced they'll do stuff to my drunk corpse (I'm purposely not even trying to get drunk on my 21st…).

So finally, I asked my Grandma what she wanted me to do for my birthday. Her “big plan” is that she wants two of my older brothers (32M and 28M) to drive me to a bar, order me one drink so “I can see what the bar experience is like” and then immediately drive me home the moment I'm finished the drink/it's paid for. I told her that sounds like an absolutely bonkers of a 21st birthday plan, to which she said I either celebrate my 21st birthday “with safety” or she's locking me in my bedroom to spend my birthday all alone. 

So here's where I'm wondering if I'd be the asshole….would it be wrong of me to just sneak out of the house on my birthday and just, do whatever I want? Like, go to Applebee's all by myself and drink/eat whatever I want and then later go to the Mall and walk around/buy whatever I want all by myself? It's honestly the only thing I can think of doing now since all my other ideas aren't allowed. 

I feel like I'd be the asshole since I'd be making my Grandma so worried by sneaking out…..

She tells my bf that I’m no longer welcome in her house. Now my bf is upset and I’ve wrecked any hope of having a civil relationship with his mom.

21,1f2tbke,AITA for not giving my ex any equity of my home???,"Sorry if this is long, but I'll have to leave a ton out to make sure it fits in one post. My (31f) and my ex husband (35m) bought a house nearly 10 years ago while married after being together for 7 years. We split up 2 years after getting the house. I moved out with our 2 kids (6m, 2m) to live with my dad until we could get our feet under us without each other. He ends up moving closer to family 2.5 hours away and I take over the house. He tells me the house is mine and he doesn't care about it. ""Let it go back to the bank if you don't want it."" 
Obviously I didn't do that. This is where we totally disagree. I ended up having to move 2.5 hours away to where he moved a year after we split. For the next 4 years I kept renters in the place and had my dad over see that the mortgage was being paid on time and any maintenance was being done.
5 years after the split I moved back into my home with my kids and 6 years after the split we finally divorced. 
He didn't show up to any court dates and I ended up with a default divorce. Since I had all the receipts showing I've been keeping up with the mortgage and repairs for 6 out of the 8(at the time) years, the judge granted me the house and no equity was to be paid to my ex. (Considering it was only 60k there wasn't much in equity anyway). 
Here is where he thinks I'm the AH. When housing prices skyrocketed (2021) he came back and wanted to sell the house from under me and keep any equity for himself because he's the one who holds the mortgage. I however am on the deed since we were married and had children together. (I also worked outside of the home). 
It's been a year since we went to court and I was trying to wait out the interest rates OR just completely pay it off as soon as I could without having to refinance because my interest rate is 4.37% currently. He still wants to force me to sell instead of letting me assume the mortgage to keep the interest rate. 
His reason is because he is legally blind and the surgery to stop what's left of his vision from deteriorating is 16k. 
I don't see why I should have to find another home for my children at a higher interest rate and a higher purchase cost that will decimate my savings and budget for who knows how long. When he has a 2017 mustang he can sell since he can't drive it, his family could stop gouging his disability for ""rent"" and I have 3 kids now (13m, 9m and 6m) to worry about. 
His argument is that since I had renters in the house, I wasn't the one paying for it. ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-27,"AITA for not giving my ex any equity of my home??? Sorry if this is long, but I'll have to leave a ton out to make sure it fits in one post. My (31f) and my ex husband (35m) bought a house nearly 10 years ago while married after being together for 7 years. We split up 2 years after getting the house. I moved out with our 2 kids (6m, 2m) to live with my dad until we could get our feet under us without each other. He ends up moving closer to family 2.5 hours away and I take over the house. He tells me the house is mine and he doesn't care about it. ""Let it go back to the bank if you don't want it."" 
Obviously I didn't do that. This is where we totally disagree. I ended up having to move 2.5 hours away to where he moved a year after we split. For the next 4 years I kept renters in the place and had my dad over see that the mortgage was being paid on time and any maintenance was being done.
5 years after the split I moved back into my home with my kids and 6 years after the split we finally divorced. 
He didn't show up to any court dates and I ended up with a default divorce. Since I had all the receipts showing I've been keeping up with the mortgage and repairs for 6 out of the 8(at the time) years, the judge granted me the house and no equity was to be paid to my ex. (Considering it was only 60k there wasn't much in equity anyway). 
Here is where he thinks I'm the AH. When housing prices skyrocketed (2021) he came back and wanted to sell the house from under me and keep any equity for himself because he's the one who holds the mortgage. I however am on the deed since we were married and had children together. (I also worked outside of the home). 
It's been a year since we went to court and I was trying to wait out the interest rates OR just completely pay it off as soon as I could without having to refinance because my interest rate is 4.37% currently. He still wants to force me to sell instead of letting me assume the mortgage to keep the interest rate. 
His reason is because he is legally blind and the surgery to stop what's left of his vision from deteriorating is 16k. 
I don't see why I should have to find another home for my children at a higher interest rate and a higher purchase cost that will decimate my savings and budget for who knows how long. When he has a 2017 mustang he can sell since he can't drive it, his family could stop gouging his disability for ""rent"" and I have 3 kids now (13m, 9m and 6m) to worry about.

24,1f2t2fr,AITA for taking my boyfriend and i’s dog after he passed away even though his mom said i couldn’t ?,"so for some back story. my boyfriend (22m) and i (20f) have been together for almost two years. about a year ago we decided that as a couple to get a dog together. we both have paid for him equally and is equally both of our dogs. i also have lived with him in his parents house since we started dating. his parents were always okay with that. 

on 8/22/24 my boyfriend was in an incident that ultimately took his life 3 days later. his parents and sister are grieving in their own ways and i know that especially as a nursing student. i have not been treated the kindest since the incident took place. i have tried not to be mad or be mean because i know this is how people grieve. 

yesterday afternoon i tried to have a conversation with his parents about the situation with me staying at the house because that had been my home for the past 2 years. his dad had been repeating to me that it was my home and i could stay as long as i needed because that’s what my boyfriend would want. well his mom had told my best friend and eventually told me that it wasn’t my home and that i would eventually have to leave (it wasn’t in a malicious way) but it did hurt a lot when she said this

the dog was brought up this conversation because that was our dog and he stayed there too. she had said that the dog wasn’t leaving the house and couldn’t leave the house. basically telling me i couldn’t take the dog my boyfriend and i had shared and got together as a couple. 

his mom has helped a lot with our dog and i would never plan to keep him away from his family. i have to go out towards his home to go to school and work so i still planned on dropping him off and picking him up and letting us both have him. 

i understand in every aspect that she lost her son and she wants every bit of him to stay home. i know grief is hard and the way people grieve is different. after she told me i couldn’t take my dog if i left, i talked to my mom and she encouraged me to pack some of my things and to get my dog and leave. my mom came to the house grabbed me and the dog and we left. 

this blew up with his family and this is something i didn’t want to do. i didn’t want to take him away and stay away. i wanted to come back and be there but i also can’t go without the one thing i have left of my boyfriend right now. my mom has messaged his parents about me and the dog leaving for a couple days so i can take some time to breathe and try to cope. 

there is so much more to this if people want more to how f*cked up it has gotten. his sister has tried to get a bill of sale for our dog and everything. i know i probably should’ve waited a couple days before leaving with the dog but after being told that the house was no longer my home, why would i want to stay? and then just leave the dog we have together that i promised him i would take care of?

25,1f2sowo,AITA? Is a pattern of not showering between the gym and your date normal?,"Throwaway 🤷‍♂️

Match with this girl on hinge. If it matters, she looks pretty good. We are meeting for dinner/drinks. She told me she was coming directly from the gym, so she won't be able to shower. No biggie – I thank her for the heads up and we go on to have a pretty nice first date, looking good so far.

Second date rolls around, and I feel like she is going out of her way to not shower. We are to meet for a walk at 9:45. She messages me again that she just got back home from the gym, has no time to shower, and is gonna step right out after grabbing a bite. I tell her thats okay to meet a few minutes later, she can shower if she'd like. She insists she would rather shower later.

I call her out on it, saying that it isn't particularly attractive, and it seems to be a pattern. She seems super shocked, because according to her she was rushing to try to make the date happen. We decide not to meet ofc.

Idk, I found it kinda disrespectful. I feel like it's pretty basic etiquette to shower between the gym and your date?!?!

26,1f2sk3y,AITA for not inviting coparent to our sons birthday? ,"To preface: my son’s father and I were never in a relationship but more so exclusive f buddies to put it simply. After some years I ended up pregnant and my son is now 2. His father was absent for my pregnancy as he was not supportive of me keeping the child which he has made abundantly clear over time.

I’ve dealt with verbal harassment on his end, mainly name calling, belittling me and insulting me trying to tear me down. Yet he is still in his son’s life and loves him, we just have nothing to do with each other. He refuses to coparent with me and makes his brother handle our communication or anything involving our son. So his brother is basically his mediator. Anyways not too long ago my coparent was upset that I asked for him to communicate with me about our son opposed to his brother. He called me plenty of names and insults, saying how much he hates and despises me (he’s said this to me so many times over the past year) but more specifically he called me an effin b*tch and stupid effin b*tch which was the final straw for me, no guy has ever called me that. 

Either way after a crying panick attack I’ve tried to heal and I feel like the best way is to have nothing to do with him at all. I don’t even say/mention his name, don’t see him, speak or text him. It’s that bad I just can’t get over the hurt he has caused me while pregnant and now even though our son is here. Well my son is having his 2nd birthday this weekend and I plan to invite my coparents relatives like mom, dad (my sons grandparents) and his siblings (sons uncles and aunts) but just not my coparent, his actual dad. 

I know it sounds wrong but it’s not fair that he gets to treat me like complete shit and enjoy our son’s birthday party. That’s not how it works. A part of me feels bad because I don’t want to take that moment away from him since he loves his son but whenever I think about it I just get so angry again. He should’ve thought about his consequences prior to his verbally abusive outlast. My family says I can’t invite his family but not him and that I’m wrong. Am I though?

My bf (20) and I went to place by ourselves, something I’ve never done with anyone before, making this my first trip alone without family.

I posted that yesterday, and now my mother has cornered me asking if I don’t appreciate her or my family, asking if I felt I didn’t want them as family and that I’d rather have a partner as my ‘family’. Now, I feel like an asshole because I didn’t ask them to come with us but I also feel like as an adult now, I should have the responsibility of going on trips with a partner or friend. 

This isn’t the first time she’s been mad about something like this. Once they went to a game and because my bf couldn’t go out of town that day but was allowed to hangout at home with me, I didn’t go (I told her 3 weeks before) and claimed I was being selfish.

My bf is the oldest of 6 kids and his responsibility as the big brother to help his family with the little siblings and help his parents around. I’ve said that multiple times, and she’s always mad that he’s ‘not picking me’ which has messed with my head a few times, and my bf and I have fought about until I told him I have had enough and I’m just ignoring whatever she has to say, no matter what it is. He has more responsibility than I do, since I’m the youngest of two, and I respect his boundaries and when we can and cannot hangout. She’s been mad apparently since yesterday, so when she asked I said ‘no, I’m not mad at you or the family’. She accused me of being a bad daughter for wanting time away from them.

28,1f2sab1,AITA for insisting my mother invaded privacy by opening my mail? ,"My mom(57) lives five hours away in my (23f) old hometown. I haven’t lived at home in FIVE years. Didn’t even go back home during college breaks. So none of my friends have been there in years. 

In high school, when I was 18 and stupid, I wrote a letter to myself. My English teacher assigned it, said it would be a time capsule about ourselves then and wonder where we are now. I have no idea what I wrote about. What I asked myself. How trashy it may be. But we had to address it to a permanent address. I had no other address but my parents. I figured I’d remember to tell my parents not to open any letters address to me in 2024. And, while I don’t remember what I wrote, I do remember putting precautions like “do not read if you’re not [my name]” cuz I treated it essentially like a diary I wouldn’t open until 23. I feared my parents would read on. 
In june, I told my mother not to open any letters addressed to me. I literally remember telling her why and her laughing and rolling her eyes but saying ok. 
But it didn’t matter.

Today i get call saying I have a letter from [my old English teacher.] I said oh yeah I know what that is, don’t open it. She said “I already did”. The way my heart sunk so fast. I immediately ask why would she open it. She said she wanted to make sure it wasn’t an invitation to a wedding or something. (Remember how none of my friends know about this address because I haven’t lived there in a half decade?) 
I start saying stuff like how it’s violating because I don’t even remember what I wrote, (which she said was filled w cuss words and she would’ve taken me to therapy if she saw it back then) and that it didn’t have her name or invite for her to read anywhere on the letter. She said I should’ve told her not to open anything, then I said I did less than three months ago, which she claims I never did. (Trust me, I DID!!) but then that I should’ve been more specific with what she couldn’t open. But I insisted I did again. 

It was also multiple pages I remember, so at some point, I’d, personally, probably think “wow this letter really isn’t meant for me” and shut it. 

But she responds like this: “There you go again! Always taking things to the top. You know I just wanted to let you know I had it but never mind” and HANGS UP ON ME. Now I can get defensive, but it’s because of stuff like this! And I haven’t spoken to her since. 

Idk. It was sent to her home, but I’m 23 and this just feels like a huge invasion of privacy. Would y’all open your grown kids mail if was sent to your address? Or call them first? Or maybe even try to remember when they asked you not to open their mail? And isn’t it illegal to open mail that isn’t yours, even if it’s your adult children?

She said I should’ve told her not to open anything, then I said I did less than three months ago, which she claims I never did. (Trust me, I DID!!) but then that I should’ve been more specific with what she couldn’t open. But I insisted I did again. 

It was also multiple pages I remember, so at some point, I’d, personally, probably think “wow this letter really isn’t meant for me” and shut it. 

But she responds like this: “There you go again! Always taking things to the top. You know I just wanted to let you know I had it but never mind” and HANGS UP ON ME. Now I can get defensive, but it’s because of stuff like this! And I haven’t spoken to her since. 

Idk. It was sent to her home, but I’m 23 and this just feels like a huge invasion of privacy. Would y’all open your grown kids mail if was sent to your address? Or call them first? Or maybe even try to remember when they asked you not to open their mail? And isn’t it illegal to open mail that isn’t yours, even if it’s your adult children?

29,1f2s44c,AITA for greeting my ex boyfriend on his (and mine!) wedding day?,"I (28f) was dating my classmate Aaron 11 years ago for 6 months. I was his first, but it wasn't a huge romance. I broke up with him due to lack of feelings, he took it like a champ and we remained friends senior year and even later in college. We lost touch a few years ago when I moved to another country. 

Meanwhile I got engaged and sent out weddinig invites to friends from highschool that I'm still in touch with. I was getting married in my homecountry on a remote location. A month later my friend Levi tells me that he received another invitation for the same date. Turns out, Aarons's getting married on the same day, not far from my wedding location! I thought that was funny. Levi then tells me that he spoke to Aaron and after finding out that I am getting married at that location on that day, Aaron said that him and his bride planned a photoshoot at that location, but that he ""absolutely doesn't want to meet"" because it's awkward and he never told his bride about me. I told Levi that I can't help being there coz it's my wedding, but if Aaron wants to make sure we don't meet he shouldn't come there from 3-7 PM. I told my future husband all about it, he thought it was a funny coincedence and that Aaron is being weird for no reason and that was all.

The big day came and it was great, I loved every moment of it. After the ceremony, guests started leaving for the reception and me and my husband stayed to take more photos. After we were done, I walked towards the car and saw Aaron and his bride with their photographer standing in front of the gate, apparently waiting for us to leave. I had to go through the gate, literally next to them and I didn't have much time to think how to play it, but decided that it would be stupid to pretend that I don't know him, so I just said in passing ""Oh hey, congratulations!"" Aaron said ""Thanks, you too"" and I went into the car. Then my husband came along and he stopped, shook Aaron's hand and gave them a hearty congratulations. When he entered the car I told him who that was, and my husband just realized it then. He forgot about the whole story and thought it was just another random wedding couple. I thought the whole thing was dumb but we left for our reception.

The day after the wedding Levi, (who was invited to both weddings but came to mine), called me to tell me that Aaron is calling me an AH for ""approaching him even though he sent word specifically not to"" and that me and my husband ""put him in a very awkward position on his wedding day"". 

Like, wtf? I think he should've rescheduled his photoshooting when he realized that it will clash with my wedding if it was so important to him not to see me (even though I still have no idea why, the whole thing is so dumb). He put himself into a situation that he choose to make awkward. As far as I'm concerned we could've taken a picture together all 4 of us and had a nice laugh.

Obligatory “i’m writing on my phone, sorry for any formatting issues”.

My girlfriend (29F) and I (27M) are currently in a small, petty, argument caused by Fortnite. I occasionally play Fortnite with my younger brother (22M), his girlfriend (22F), and her older brother whose age i’m not aware of. Prior to consistently being part of their squad, my brother would invite me to play with him, his girlfriend, and her friend (22F). I only played with the friend on the team a max of three times, all of which were because my brother sent me an in game invite to join them and the friend was already in the group. 

My girlfriend thought I had only played with the friend once and she didn’t have much of an issue with that. Today it came up in conversation and I told her it was only a max of three times and then never again. Which is where the issue arises. She is very upset because she feels that I was actively hiding this information from her, which was not the case at all. She repeated that it’s disrespectful to play with a random woman and another couple and that it crosses a boundary. I kept saying it was only a max of three times and that I hadn’t played in a group with her since then.  I may have messed up by saying she was acting insecure because it’s a team based video game with my brother and his girlfriend as well. That it would be different and I would understand if I was playing with just myself and the friend, but that isn’t what happened.

I maintain that I did nothing wrong by playing with them, especially since I haven’t played in a group with the friend since then. Am I somehow in the wrong here?

31,1f2rhhl,AITA for no being understand to my noisy family next door?,"I (31m) live in a small semi-detached with my partner (33F) in the UK. Around a year ago, a family of four moved into the other side of the wall. We introduced ourselves and welcomed them to the neighbourhood, and we learned that Mum's hearing is partially impaired.

It's an old house, and the soundproofing is not great. We can hear their conversations, TVs or any other sounds quite clear. The vibration from stomping can travel via the floor and shake our decorations. Their kids often yell, scream, bang and run around the house when they are home. We both work hybrid and would work from home 2-3 days a week. The noise affects our work and makes it more difficult to concentrate. We understand kids will be kids, plus with the situation of the mum, we try to be as understanding as possible and cope with it with it even though we are frustrated.

At the beginning of the school holiday, they had a new puppy and we could hear it bark occasionally. No big deal; that's a normal. But the barking can last a few hours. It amplified our noise issue; my colleagues can hear their noise from my side during meetings. I didn't confront them immediately as I wanted to wait and see if there would be improvement after a while.

Last week I had an important remote presentation. The noise on that day is particularly bad as they seem to have another family with kids visiting. Yielding to my frustration, I banged the wall a few times before the start of the meeting.

Today I found the letter below in my mailbox.

*To the neighbour ,*

*I write on behalf of my daughters family. They know nothing of my contacting you.*

*I would like you to know that my daughter is profoundly deaf and has successfully obtained a degree and has held down a nursery nurse job as well as raising her two daughters who have both been diagnosed with ADHD. My son in law works tong hours and is often on call to provide for his family.*

*They have pets, including a new puppy, to make family memories. As I am sure you are aware young children and animals will occasionally disrupt your peace, but I ask that you be a little more understanding of what they are going through.*

*If you have any issues in the future I ask that you contact me to discuss matters before causing them distress they can do without at the present time. Your banging on the watt is childish.*

*My daughter and her partner have bought this home they do not intend to move. If you rent and you cannot tolerate the situation or find it in your heart to be more tolerant or forgiving I suggest you find rented accommodation elsewhere.*

*They are good people and should you ever need anything, they would be there for you in a heartbeat.*

*Happy to discuss.*

I was not moved and still did not take them.

Now for the background. My ex and I broke up when our youngest was 1. He met his wife not long after. They have a very rocky relationship. Lots of cheating on his part, they got married despite the cheating and they hate the fact I don't leave the kids with them and let them pretend to be a family of five. They had a child together and now they claim there is no breaking up no matter how bad it gets. Unfortunately, between my kids and my ex and his wife telling me details of their relationship, I know far too much. It's toxic but not toxic enough to change custody of my kids in the eyes of the courts. I have tried. Even a therapist thought it would be in my kids best interest. But they are cared for and that seems to be all that counts.

The relationship between me and them is toxic too when we interact so I keep any and all interactions to a minimum. I document all relevant things that could help with custody, I keep my kids in therapy (ex doesn't take them) and I try to give my kids stability and a safe space to talk. They know their dad's wife is in the hospital. They do not want to see her.

My ex's mom also asked me to let the kids go see her. She said this is a hard time and the family should lean on each other during this time. That bettering the relationships are important. 

Ex reached out again last night and told me he wants the kids at the hospital today. I replied no. He told me I'm trying to destroy the family and should be ashamed and the kids will be there every day when he has them.

36,1f2qpsf,AITAH for not cooking dinner ,"My husband (27m) call it disrespect when I (24F) didn’t cook dinner last night. For context I am a stay at home mom of two children and we just got a puppy, I also am trying to start an Etsy. Yesterday I had to run errands and I sent out my first order it was also national dog day and I wanted to get the bandanna from Dutch bros for my dog which wasn’t going to be handed out till after 5. 

When I got home he had just gotten home and was already eating something before asking if I was making dinner. I often don’t even make dinner because he always finds a way to say it’s gross when the two kids and I like it and he also is very particular about his protein/calories. I suggest he grill and he said it was too late. When he grills all he has to worry about is getting the grill started and putting it on, as I always do the prep/marinade seasoning clean up and what not. So nothing ended up getting made the kids ate chicken nuggets which is always a hit with them and he ate what ever he made him self. In the end I didn’t even eat dinner and just went to bed after I got the kids to sleep. 

When we were laying down we were talking and ended up in an argument and part of it was that I was a disrespectful bitch by not making dinner. When he has even told me not to cook anymore because I always make “raw” chicken. That happened once when I didn’t have a thermometer and I baked something years ago now I have a thermometer and always check to make sure it’s not. I’m not a great cook by any means but it’s not bad I just stick to basic things (rice, chicken, salmon, pasta) and make it different ways to keep it fresh. 

I used to love cooking when we first got married but now it’s more of a chore than anything and I hate it, he doesn’t watch the kids while I cook nor help with clean up I end up cooking and the house is destroyed by the time I’m done because I’m trying to juggle two toddlers and a dog and make sure nothing is burning. Then when I’m done I have to clean it all up get the kids to bed and clean up the living room because no one could sit and watch them. So AITAH for not cooking dinner for my husband anymore.

When he has even told me not to cook anymore because I always make “raw” chicken. That happened once when I didn’t have a thermometer and I baked something years ago now I have a thermometer and always check to make sure it’s not. I’m not a great cook by any means but it’s not bad I just stick to basic things (rice, chicken, salmon, pasta) and make it different ways to keep it fresh. 

I used to love cooking when we first got married but now it’s more of a chore than anything and I hate it, he doesn’t watch the kids while I cook nor help with clean up I end up cooking and the house is destroyed by the time I’m done because I’m trying to juggle two toddlers and a dog and make sure nothing is burning. Then when I’m done I have to clean it all up get the kids to bed and clean up the living room because no one could sit and watch them. So AITAH for not cooking dinner for my husband anymore.

37,1f2qpkz,AITA for not catering to my friend during my girlfriend and I’s plans?,"So for context 

My friend, who i’ll refer to as S, is friends with my girlfriend. We’ve all been friends for around the same amount of time, and fairly good friends at that. I asked out my girlfriend about a month ago, and so far, so good between us. However, S hasn’t been as receptive. He’s been cold, distant, and almost mean towards me, while worshipping the ground my girlfriend walks on. I figured he was just adjusting and gave him some time. Things seemed to be going better, until our first hiccup. I’d asked my girlfriend on a date on sunday, once she got back from a movie with friends, and she’d accepted. A day after I asked, S was upset when he found out and I hadn’t told him. I initially didn’t think much of it, but he brought it up again. We ended up having a talk, where I brought up that I didn’t think I needed to clue him into it, and that if I make plans with my girlfriend I shouldn’t have to run them by him to make sure it was okay. His reasoning was that we’ve been a trio for so long, that it was completely reasonable to ask to be clued into what’s happening. The resolution was a good compromise in my eyes, if I made plans i’d let him know, and he wouldn’t try to guilt trip me out of them. Problem solved right? Well, this morning I found out i’m both off work tomorrow and i’d have my place to myself, perfect time for a second date. I ask my girlfriend, she says yes. I let S know, and he instantly asks if I can change days. He explains it’s the one year “anniversary” (i’m not sure what word to use besides that) since his childhood dog died. He wants us both there to comfort him. I explain my situation, but he’s still asking or saying that if it’s too big of a deal we can just leave him alone. I haven’t said anything back yet, but I don’t really know what to say. I want to tell him that this is exactly what I was talking about by “guilt trip” but I think that may be too insensitive given the context matter. I will add, we both have other friends outside of each other, and a mutual friend group that includes the three of us. It doesn’t have to be me and my girlfriend there. 

So am I the asshole here?

40,1f2qi5g,AITA for not paying my partner's tuition deposit?,"My partner and I have been together for 7 years, though the past 3 have been a struggle. 

I worked 3 jobs and was so stressed and tired all the time, so I decided to go back to school. My partner and I talked it over, did all the math, and decided it was doable. 

I was still going to have to work at least 2 jobs to afford it, but it would work out better in the long run. I applied for and received a few scholarships and bursaries, which helped significantly.

Within the first month of my 2nd year of my degree, my partner rage quit his job (55K/year) and I got him a job at a store I worked at, but it's only part time and minimum wage, so he's only making ~18K a year or less.

I knew how stressed out he was with his job, so I was empathetic at the time. He said he would find another job shortly and everything would be fine. While I was empathetic, I was and still am aggravated that he made this decision without discussing it with me. 

I worked 3 jobs for the remaining years of my degree and graduated this June with Honours.

I've lost nearly 30lbs from stress and just not having the time to eat or sleep. My partner is still working part time at that same store, as he claims he's been applying for jobs but never hears anything back. 

I understand the job market sucks right now, but I have a feeling he isn't even actually applying to anything. During this time, I had multiple friends get laid off and every single one was able to find other employment. Every single one. 

All he pays for is his half of rent because that's all he can afford. I cover everything else, from groceries to insurance to meds to internet. Everything else. 

I now have 4 jobs to make up for the rising costs of, well, everything. I do 12 hour shifts at my one job every weekend, 3 days a week at my day job, 2-3 night shifts a week at my 3rd job, and my 4th is an on call job where I'm available any time I'm not at my other 3 jobs. Fortunately, these jobs are better paying and in my field, but everything is still so expensive, especially when you have to nearly completely support yourself and another person. I'm exhausted and burnt out and nearing a breakdown. 

My partner decided that since the job market isn't great, he should also go back to school and was accepted. You'd think that'd be great, but he informed me today that he needs $500 for his tuition deposit.

This deposit is common and needs to be paid each year before classes begin.

I also needed $500 for my tuition deposit and had to work my ass off at 3 different jobs every single year to pay it, but he's relying on me to pay his, and I'm assuming I'll have to pay it for him every single year of his program, since he can't seem to find better employment/another job. 

I really don't think it should be up to me to come up with that money, but he thinks that because I want him to get his life together (yes, I've said this to him) that I should pay for it.

I was more interested in renovating the kitchen, as we had discussed removing the washer/dryer from the kitchen to make it larger and more functional. However, my mother insisted on updating the bathroom instead. I agreed to this because I didn’t want to cause conflict, even though I didn’t use that bathroom much and was fine with it as it was.

The contractor, Miguel (fake name to protect the innocent), and my mother have had several disagreements during the renovation process.

She assumed that he would eventually ask for more money, especially since he had previously asked for additional payment when there was a misunderstanding about the shower pan, which was not clearly specified in the contract.

Here’s where things get complicated: Miguel didn’t initially ask for more money regarding the tiling. He only requested more time to complete the job. My mother, however, was convinced that he was trying to cheat us and demanded that I agree with her perspective. I tried to stay neutral and suggested we wait and see if Miguel would actually ask for more money, as I didn’t want to make assumptions without concrete evidence. I also pointed out that Miguel’s request for additional time seemed reasonable and that he had previously done extra work (like cutting the shower pan) without asking for more money.

My mom was very angry that I wasn’t immediately siding with her. She accused me of being against her and even threatened to involve my father and lawyers. Despite my efforts to stay neutral and reasonable, my mother’s frustration seemed to escalate.

44,1f2q35h,"AITA because my sister doesn’t want to go on vacation with us anymore
","Once a year, my sister, my brother, my mother, and I go on vacation together.

This year, it was time again last week. It was already the fourth vacation with this group. As always, at the end, it’s about looking forward to the next vacation and planning a little. Where should we go, and when is everyone available? We quickly agreed on a time because my sister already knows, due to her schooling, when she needs to take time off in the summer.

Yesterday, I got a message from her saying she’s not sure if she wants to travel with us because she wants to go on vacation with her boyfriend. I then asked if it would be possible to schedule a different time, but she didn’t respond to that. She only mentioned that they want to travel alone. I ended the chat by saying that we were talking past each other.

Today, I received another message from her, saying that she talked to her boyfriend and they’ve decided she no longer wants to travel with us because they now have their own family.

I then called her to ask for an explanation as to why she can’t travel with her boyfriend and with us as well. She replied that her boyfriend was very sad when she went on vacation with us this year.

 Once a year, my sister, my brother, my mother, and I go on vacation together.

This year, it was time again last week. It was already the fourth vacation with this group. As always, at the end, it’s about looking forward to the next vacation and planning a little. Where should we go, and when is everyone available? We quickly agreed on a time because my sister already knows, due to her schooling, when she needs to take time off in the summer.

Yesterday, I got a message from her saying she’s not sure if she wants to travel with us because she wants to go on vacation with her boyfriend. I then asked if it would be possible to schedule a different time, but she didn’t respond to that. She only mentioned that they want to travel alone. I ended the chat by saying that we were talking past each other.

Today, I received another message from her, saying that she talked to her boyfriend and they’ve decided she no longer wants to travel with us because they now have their own family.

I then called her to ask for an explanation as to why she can’t travel with her boyfriend and with us as well. She replied that her boyfriend was very sad when she went on vacation with us this year. I expressed my understanding but also pointed out that all of us have partners who weren’t with us. I enjoy the vacations with this group because we rarely spend so much time together at once.

Thats when I noticed he would routinely leave the door unlocked. I didn’t make a big deal-just said it doesn’t make me comfortable and he would just say it’s not a big deal.

He even asked me to not make a big deal out of him forgetting once or twice by accident so i started making it a lighthearted “joke.”

The last few weeks he has been taking my son to the gym after work usually from 8-9:30.

I sent a text expressing that it seems like there is no concern for my safety.

They came home and when he finally comes up I ask him about the text-he says he JUST saw it. No apology. He jokes about getting sex, asks if I want a snack, I eat the snack, and eventually fall asleep as he is downstairs the rest of the night. In the morning I ask if he’s going to apologize and his exact words were “apologize for what-you’re always mad.”

I asked my son if they discussed it on the way home from gym and my son said yes and that husband doesn’t think it’s a big deal but he understands that I do bc nothing is 100%, but that we live in a safe community blah blah.He used the excuse that when they left for the gym it was still daytime.

During all of this, I kept saying, calm down, take your time, it's not a big deal, just to maintain a neutral environment. But my colleague kept saying, you should have known this, this is very common knowledge why don't you know this. This made my replies sound very defensive and formal. I could see through her look, that she's has lost faith in this, while she still kept her composure. 

Learning through these interviews, there are a lot of people who needs a job, and they are willing to trade-off their time and energy for it, but something is keeping them to prepare for interviews. For many candidates, just the lack of preparation for the interview has made them lose the opportunity. People go through their own struggles and circumstances, but the interviewer is unaware of all of that. ",1.0,1.0349918603897095,1,1

58,1f2nqqv,WIBTA if I uninvited my mom from my wedding for calling my choices “tacky” behind my back?,"WIBTA if I uninvited my mom from my wedding for calling my choices “tacky” behind my back?

On mobile so forgive any formatting issues! I, (21 f) and my fiancé (24m) are getting married in a month and a half and I’m very excited. I always thought I would elope instead of having a wedding because I have a lot of trauma from my narcissistic mother (48 f) and knew she would cause some kind of drama. Well I’m right about that much. 

I cut contact with my mom for about a year when I left college and started talking to her again almost a year ago. The distance allowed me to start healing from my past and I felt I was making good progress. For context, I was somehow both a scapegoat and golden child at the same time, and my siblings were more or less ignored. My mom wanted to live vicariously through me and she’s always been a major control freak who could never admit to being wrong. 

This past year I’ve been navigating having a relationship with my mother as an adult, and while I couldn’t talk to her about everything, I genuinely thought things were going well. 

This past weekend, my sister, (16f) told me that my mom was complaining about me wanting to include a moon on my wedding invitations and was saying stuff like “that’s tacky” and “this is a wedding, not prom”. My wedding is sort of celestial-themed, but it’s not over the top in terms of design. My mom had offered to design my invitations, and she had done the same for the save the dates, which she did a great job with. 

She never expressed anything negative to me about what I wanted the invites to look like, but did suggest that instead of having the moon in the background that we could do a moon stamp on the wax seals. I thought it was a cool idea so I said yes. Now I feel manipulated and betrayed. 

She’s made some other comments about things I wanted/was thinking about calling stuff tacky, like doing karaoke at the reception. Everyone else I’ve talked to (mostly my fiancé’s family, who I’m very close with) loves the ideas I have and reassured me that they aren’t tacky. I’ve been working on distancing myself from my mom’s opinions, but it’s hard when the little girl inside me just wants her mom to love and validate her. I can’t trust her anymore, and I would rather have a wedding that I love than constantly be worried whether she thinks it’s tacky or if she’s gossiping behind my back. So, WIBTA if I told my mom that if she thinks my wedding is tacky, she can just not bother to show up? 

Edit: I didn’t go into detail on the abuse I experienced at her hands as a child because it’s too long to get into here. However, my mom is cluster B and CPS was called on my parents twice before my dad stepped up to try to fix things, but unfortunately, by that point I was out of the house. I went no contact with my mother during college and one of my other siblings is no contact with her right now. my issue isn’t with the invitations, it’s with the immature behavior. Instead of talking to me if she had an issue with something I wanted on the design, she complained to my sister about what I wanted, and then made a suggestion to me that I did not realize was her way of trying to talk me out of what I wanted in favor of her preferences. That’s why I feel betrayed, especially after trying to rebuild our relationship after being no contact with her. This is also not the first issue my mother has caused throughout planning the wedding. She was pissed that my future mother-in-law and I were looking at venues together for things that my future in-laws are paying for and thought that she and I should be the ones picking out the things and then going to my future in-laws to get approval on the cost, and even went so far as to take over paying for my cake without consulting my dad about budget, just so that she could pick the bakery. So to be clear if I uninvited her, it’s because of a long standing pattern of behavior, and knowing that while I am currently working on healing from my past and my tendency to seek her approval at the expense of my own wants and desires, I don’t want the fear of her thinking it’s “tacky” and gossiping behind my back to get in the way of enjoying my wedding day.

My divorce decree stated we were to split ""children's medical expenses 60/40"". Unfortunately it did not have an age expiry date or specific language about what was included.

Our daughter (F20) has always had vague and persistent health issues; headaches, fatigue, nausea, prone to illness, etc. Over the years I have taken her to lots of doctors and specialists and we have not found anything definitively wrong . Her father has always blamed her eating habits and lack of exercise and has never agreed that there could be anything physically wrong.

This summer, between her sophomore and junior years in college I took it on myself to figure out what was wrong. I found a good internal medicine doctor who believed there was a problem and sent her off to specialists to get to the bottom of it. Through months of scans and blood tests she was diagnosed with Hashimoto's Disease and Endometriosis.

The Internist impressed upon us that we had found it so early that there is little to no damage on her ovaries or thyroid, which was great news. The testing was fairly expensive and I paid all of the co-pays on my credit card. I asked my ex to pay for part of them, since they were for our daughter's health and he refused, stating that we had just ""internet fear mongered"" and that she had ""made herself sick by not eating properly.""

Am I the asshole for not making a financial plan and discussing it with my ex husband before the testing?

Ex knew we were seeking medical help, approved of the main doctor I took her to but wanted to be present at each appointment which she did not want. I updated him about everything along the way until he got nasty about me personally.

61,1f2mnit,AITA for meeting up with a friend on our family vacation?,"
My family and I (30f) are going on a 2 week family vacation to Disney World in a month's time. It's going to be me, my brother (27) and my parents. I'm from the UK and have a friend that lives in the states (29f). We met up and had a mini Disney vacation a few months back while I was on a solo trip for my 30th birthday, and I mentioned that I'd be coming back later in the year and it would be great to meet up again. 

My friend is very special to me and her mother is terminally ill so I want to be there for her as much as possible. She absolutely loved Disney when we went a few months back and really wants to go again.

She has booked a few days in the area to coincide with the last few days of our trip and plans on doing the parks too, so we plan on meeting a few times. I figured that, being an adult, my mother wouldn't mind me going off to do my own thing for a couple of days out of the 2 weeks. I just let her know what's going on, and she proceeds to scream at me, yelling that she doesn't want to meet with anyone else and that it will completely ruin all of our plans as a family (we haven't even made any plans as far as itinerary goes yet). I explain that she doesn't have to meet her and she, my dad and my brother can still do whatever they want to do without me, but she was having none of it, continuing to yell at me and insisting it's going to ruin everything. I told her she was being a petulant child and to go fuck herself. 

I didn't tell her about my previously mentioned solo trip until about 2 weeks beforehand for this exact reason, and she was pissed off that I didn't invite her along to join me. I'd also like to add that a few years ago she took a day out of our mother/daughter Disney trip to spend the day with a coworker who was there at the same as us, which I had absolutely no problem with and was happy to go off and do my own thing. So I find it very hypocritical that she's berating me for doing the exact same thing. 

Am I in the wrong here? Am I being selfish for spending time with my friend instead of my family for a few days? 

EDIT for clarification: I am paying my share of the trip expenses out of my own pocket.

He wants me and one other guy to pitch in for the air bnb but not the rest of the people because they don’t have jobs. I’m just wondering how that’s fair..? it would be 600 dollars in total and i’m expected to pay 200 since it’s split 3 ways even though 5 people are going to stay there. Mind you they’re all probably sleeping over in the air bnb while i can’t because i have work. Also mind you i’m 17 and the other two are 18,19.

63,1f2mkd5,AITA for talking to a guy in his native language?,"Context: I live abroad in a non-English-speaking country. I have a group of fellow English-speaking friends who I hang out with regularly: Sophie, Ava, and Jess. I speak the local language the best, Ava and Jess are pretty good, and Sophie is still learning.

One night, Sophie spotted a guy she liked at the bar. She’s super shy and didn’t want to hit on him so we sat at the table right next to where he was sitting alone. He didn’t acknowledge us. Sophie wouldn’t talk to him so Jess and Ava started playfully shoving me like “you do it, Name!! Get him to come over and talk to Sophie!!” cus I’m the most outgoing one and always talk to people when we’re out. I didn’t really want to, but then Sophie agreed with them, too. 

So I did it. I tapped him on the shoulder and asked him (in the local language) if he came by himself. After commenting on my language skill, he said he was there alone just to watch the Olympics on the big screen. He seemed shy and like he was going to end the conversation so I tried asking him a follow-up about the Olympics to spur the convo until my friends could chime in or something. I didn’t really know what I was doing, I was just trying to keep the convo going. He answered my question but went back to watching and never ended up speaking to my friends.

When I turned back, Jess started saying things like “What the hell, Name? Why didn’t you speak to him in English? You know that Sophie needs a guy who can speak English so you should have started out with that. Why would you talk to him in Local Language? You’re so thoughtless. He wasn’t for you, he was for Sophie.” Ava said some words in agreement with Jess but not harsh, just like “Yeah you should’ve spoken English.” Sophie didn’t say anything. Anyway I pushed back a bit saying the guy was from there and it just made sense to me at that moment to speak to him in Local Language, because that’s probably more comfortable for him, and that I didn’t have time to think through details like that when they were egging me on and pushing me to go talk to him. They kept interrupting me arguing and I remember Jess said “well maybe use your brain next time. It wasn’t about you.” As if I was trying to steal this dude from Sophie??

Ik what they said makes sense and it would have been smarter to lead off in English since Sophie speaks mainly English, but I still feel like Jess was really harsh and wouldn’t let it go? And outcome is the same, the man just wanted to watch sports. 

All of us haven’t hung out together since, mostly cus we’re busy but I feel like the vibes are off cus Jess and Ava have been ignoring my messages in our group chat. Everything seems normal with Sophie. 

Anyway, AITA? Was talking to this guy in his native language too thoughtless, or self-serving as Jess said? Does it come off as me trying to steal the man my friend was interested in?

68,1f2ly3f,AITA for not supporting my boyfriend in his new interest of earrings?,"Hello! I apologize in advance for any spelling mistakes, English is not my first language!

My boyfriend (19m) and I (19f) have been together since junior year of high school, I am now in college and he has graduated from a shorter program. We are currently long distance (about 10 hours away) and it has not been easy but we manage. For the past, I want to say 4 months, he has all of a sudden gotten this great interest for the tech kind of clothing. He has always liked it, and owns a few pairs of nice cargo pants, but these tech clothes are super different from what I am used to seeing on him. About 8 months ago he was into jeans and a t shirt and a flannel and this is almost a 180 from that, and I know I have to get used to change, but I feel as though I am the a-hole because I dont like it.

I feel incredibly horrible because I dont like this style at all, and that is not fair to him. I feel as though some of this stuff might be influenced by his friend, and he's a great guy but that has always been his style, and even then it's more street wear than tech. I dont want to stop my boyfriend from being who he is, but at the same time it seems as though he is a totally different person than from 8 months ago for example. I understand threat since we started dating at 16 we are growing up together and so i have seen many of his ""eras"", but they were all similar and this is very different.

He has also expressed his interest in getting earrings, which came as a huge surprise to me. Again, i think it is influenced by his friend, but his friend can pull it off, I dont think that my boyfriend can pull them off, and I feel horrible for thinking that. He bought the earrings he wanted in the mail and i got to see them in person vs the picture that i got from the website earlier, and i dont like them at all. His earrings are longer than mine, they dont match his face, they just dont look good and i dont have the heart to tell him that, but he can probably see it in my face and hear it in my tone of voice, and i feel like the worst girlfriend in the world because I'm not being supportive towards him. And I feel like I am not allowed to have a say in it, because it is his body, his style and his choices, and I would feel hurt if he didnt like something that I wear that I like, but I would understand And choose not to wear it around him, but earrings are different, I cant expect him to take them out everytime we see or FaceTime eachother.

I feel soooo bad because I love this boy with all my heart and I would never do anything intentionally to hurt him, but i hate them so much. I wish i liked them but i dont. i picture him wearing them in pictures or when he's on top of me or just eating dinner and i cant like them, and i feel horrible for it. Call me a horrible girlfriend if you will, just pls be nice as i am still human and have feelings, i just don't know what to do. Has anybody else been in this situation before?

Edit:
Thank you guys for your input, there are a few things i would like to clarify because it seems as though i didn’t express my feelings in the correct way, it might be the language barrier. 

1- i don’t mean to blame his friend for influencing him. it’s hard to explain, i should have left it out in the first place because it’s hard to put my thoughts into words. i don’t blame anybody, his friend had that style before my bf did and that’s fine, i thought more « influenced » because it came out of the blue to me, after his friend got the earrings. 

2- im not sure why people correlate the fact that i don’t like his earrings to mean that i don’t like him or that i like him only for his looks. i love my boyfriend more than anyone can imagine, that’s why im putting up with long distance in hope that we can be together in person all the time someday. yes were young but im in love so why would i leave him if there’s no good reason. As i had mentioned in a comment to a very nice person, if you don’t like the colour purple and your s/o started wearing the colour purple all the time, would that make you think less of them? it shouldn’t, and i don’t think less of my boyfriend for having earrings, im more upset at myself for not being on board with them no matter how hard i try to gaslight myself into liking them for him, because i want to be supporting in everything he does. earrings are just a big change when you’ve known him for 6 years and he’s never had earrings. 

3- at the end of the day, my issue isn’t with his style, it’s with myself for not liking his style. i don’t like him any less because he likes ones style and i like another. some people are right, i think it is confusing me a little extra because im not there to see all the changes that are happening because we live so far away. I see him once a month if not once every two months, and though we talk a lot, we also have conflicting work schedules which don’t make it easy as well. 

thank you to those who are kind with what they are saying, and aren’t jumping to conclusions that i only like my boyfriend for his looks or that im shallow for not liking the way he dresses. it’s all new to me and the changes are happening without me there it’s hard to grasp the new when you’re used to the old. i hope this helps to clarify some things in the comments :)",Asshole,2024-08-27,"AITA for not supporting my boyfriend in his new interest of earrings?

69,1f2ln19,"AITA for being ""ungrateful"" about my sister taking me ""on vacation""?","My older sister (30f) and I (15m) are not on good terms with our parents, so until I go to college, I am living with her. She works for the government, and this summer, she is working overseas in the UK. Just because of logistics and the fact that somebody has to watch over me, she has taken me along with her, and we are flying home in the first week of September.

  
Living in the UK has been a lot more boring than I thought it would be, and living together with my sister for the summer has been pretty hectic, and I sort of miss the privacy. She's very doting, and she has a habit of nagging me and all that. Last night, we got into a pretty big fight where I admitted to her that our trip to the UK has NOT lived up to my expectations. We're not doing anything fun here! Our fight drove her to tears, and she told me that I had pulled the rug out from under her, because for all this time, she thought I was grateful that I had my older sister to care for me.

And we recently got very close to the point that we share things with each other that no one else knows. We are only online friends, we met on reddit and it's been very good so far for us.

A few days ago, the topic of gambling came up and she said that she has been gambling for a few years now. Her dad and his best friend introduced her to gambling when she was 12 and then she started doing it with her friends at school. She says that she will gamble irl maybe once every 3 or 4 months, mainly in family gatherings. But she plays many poker games and other types of gambling on her computer almost everyday. 

She said she just does it for fun and not to win money. She says it gives her the thrill and gives her a escape from boredom. She says she is not addicted and she can quit anytime she wants. Obviously that's what every addict in history has ever said. 

I was worried when she first told me but I didn't tell her to quit right away. The next day I explained to her in detail how it's illegal under 18 and why it's bad for her mental health and also her family's financial well being. She doesn't care much about money, apparently they are super rich. So I put more emphasis on the mental health part. Now she got mad at me saying that I am trying to control her and that I am not one to decide for her. I explained to her everything why I am worried and why she should take a break from gambling. But she was just mad and she told me to fuck off. She hasn't blocked me but she doesn't want to talk to me now. I don't think I did anything wrong. I was only trying to help her.

He learned about GME and the meme stocks while we were together and eventually convinced me to invest my savings and my bonuses I made from work. In total I have put around 5 figures worth of money in and hope that one day it will be worth more. I have looked into things myself and I do believe that someday it will pay out. 

He also has put money into the stock market but he tends to buy calls that end up expiring worthless or has sold at a loss. I never liked calls and would try to get him to just buy shares instead. He does have some shares but not as many as I do.

When we were together, I considered our money to be ours. We each invested into our own brokerage accounts but if we made money we would decide what to do with it together. 

Now that we have broken up though I consider the money that I bought shares with and still have to be mine. This upset him when he asked if I considered them to be ours.

If my shares were ever to pop off and make a lot of money I always wanted to give him some because he was the one that convinced me to invest.

73,1f2kp8r,AITA for being sad that my friend is ignoring me after i passed out on a night out?,"this saturday i (19F) went out with a (18F) friend i only met irl twice before. we don’t talk much but we really liked each other and wanted to hang out. we went to this really busy avenue at night with another friend of hers that i didn’t know, but it was chill. i drank a beer before meeting with them and then we drank gin and by 11:30pm i was already pretty drunk but, yknow, still conscious. 

after that i have absolutely no memory of the rest of the night, and i got home by 3:30am with my phone locked for 3 hours and vomit over me. i was completely wasted and passed out in the shower.

i asked the other girl what happened the next morninh: i got SO wasted that i fell with my head to the ground in the middle of the street, lost my stuff and they found me sitting by a shop somewhere in the avenue. i had puke over me and they got me an uber home.

it really creeped me out because i never got this wasted before and i really don’t recall drinking that hard, not by 11:30pm (which is the last time i took pictures with them and actively have memories).

but the memories that i have by 11:30pm is that a male friend of hers showed up and drank with us and just hang out there, pretty chill. i offered him the gin when i was with the bottle and in exchange he offered me his drink, it was pretty sweet so i took like 3 long sips and that was it. that’s really one of the last things i remember clearly about that night. i have a lot of bruises in my body that i believe are because of the fall.

when i texted my friend the next day, she took a while to answer and was dry. i was already apologizing profusely and was deeply regretful of everything that happened and specially for making her take care of me. however, before that, when i was talking to the other girl, i mentioned that i had drank from that one friend’s cup and that maybe there was something in it and she agreed.

disclaimer: i never said that he drugged ME or had any intentions behind it, every time i mentioned the possibility i always reinforced that he was drinking from the cup himself and might just have forgotten to mention that there was something else in it.

anyways, i told her about the possibility because this is my last clear memory of the night and i know i drank from his cup. 

however she denied and said he didn’t have any cup or drink with him and was only drinking the gin we offered him, but i know that’s not true. she also said i only got wasted from the gin. also, i was the only one that drank from his cup. 

after that she just ghosted me and is not replying ever since, and it is making me feel really bad and anxious. she’s ignoring me and it’s eating me alive and i just wish she would reply, even if it’s to say she hates me and is mad at me.

im not texting her again and am respecting her space cuz she has the right to be mad at me. i feel like thrash and don’t know how to deal with this feeling.

Of course I started arguing back trying to defend myself, my dad then stepped in and started yelling at me too, saying that I had an attitude and demanded that I switch seats with my sister, my mom said the same thing too even though she didn't even hear me, and my dad didn't even care until my mom started yelling at me, they then told me if I didn't stop yelling and ""causing a scene"" then we where going to leave the theater all together, So I just gave up. And moved back to my original seat, and my parents switched so that my little sister was sitting between them, taking up a seat that wasn't even theirs, so they where all sitting together while there was an empty seat between them and me. And by that time, the movie was already ruined for me because my family humiliated me in front of the entire theater over a seat. they also ate most of the popcorn before the movie even started and handed me a popcorn bucket with barely anything left, I'm guessing to be petty? after the movie was over we fought the whole way home, and they told me the whole thing was completely my fault even though all I did was ask, I thought about the whole thing for months, and I never even had an attitude, all I said was ""can we switch seats please?""

We were all very excited to meet her and when we finally did we were okay with her. She matches the same level of awkwardness and social anxiety that he possess, which was not ideal, but were happy he at least found someone. 

  
Over the next 3 years he continued to become more and more distant, at first we thought it was just him trying to spend as much time as possible with her, which i will admit i did the same when i first got into a serious relationship. 

  
As the years progressed we started to see less and less of him, Myself and a younger cousin of mine would constantly invite him places and even invite the both of them and we would either get ghosted or get some excuse. It was years of battling from our point just to get the kid out of the house. There are a lot of poor experiences we had with this girl, but i don't want to focus on that. Also important to add that my cousin has some severe trauma which IMO has always been a crutch that he leans on to act a certain way without any progression.

It was a real honor that they asked me as i always thought of them as another set of siblings.

I spent weeks trying to get him to come and he finally bails when he is called out to confirm. I was seriously disappointed that he chose to this, because the real reason is not because of safety, but because of his girlfriends controlling nature, and his aversion to confrontation. 

  
That was last week. Now this upcoming weekend his girlfriend will be out of town and he is scrambling to make plans to go golf 3 times in a single weekend because this is his ""free time"". 

  
I have thought about it, and talked with my wife, and am leaning on the choice to not go as i feel like i am only enabling his behavior that he is only free when she is gone.

77,1f2jiqw,AITA for making my friend uninvite someone to my house/party?,"AITA for making my friend uninvite someone from my house/party?

Every year I host a Halloween get together for my closest friends and I at my home. I spend my time and money making and buying food, games, decorations, you name it. It’s always a small group because I only invite the best friends who put the time and effort into being friends. 

Recently, the friends I am inviting and myself settled on a date for our Halloween party. Everything was great. This year we were planning on making our own personal Halloween pizzas, personal sized carrot cakes, a bonfire, playing a crime solving game, watching movies, etc. Majority of the activities/food are bought by me, and my friends have the option to bring something as well, or just show up for a good time. 

All these festivities take place at my home, and along with that comes loads of cleaning and prepping to make sure my home is suitable and ready for my friends to come over. 

Then suddenly and needless to say, RANDOMLY, I seen a message in our group chat that said “I invited ____ to our party”. The person invited hasn’t spoke to me in yearsss. 

Being the very demure person I am, I messaged my friend privately and asked if they were being serious. They responded and told me they ran into said person at the store and just invited them.

Every year I host a Halloween get together for my closest friends and I at my home. I spend my time and money making and buying food, games, decorations, you name it. It’s always a small group because I only invite the best friends who put the time and effort into being friends. 

Recently, the friends I am inviting and myself settled on a date for our Halloween party. Everything was great. This year we were planning on making our own personal Halloween pizzas, personal sized carrot cakes, a bonfire, playing a crime solving game, watching movies, etc. Majority of the activities/food are bought by me, and my friends have the option to bring something as well, or just show up for a good time. 

All these festivities take place at my home, and along with that comes loads of cleaning and prepping to make sure my home is suitable and ready for my friends to come over. 

Then suddenly and needless to say, RANDOMLY, I seen a message in our group chat that said “I invited ____ to our party”. The person invited hasn’t spoke to me in yearsss. 

Being the very demure person I am, I messaged my friend privately and asked if they were being serious. They responded and told me they ran into said person at the store and just invited them. I then messaged my friend and politely said I didn’t think that was a good idea. To which my friend responded and asked why?

No promises of returning either. I'm a Case Manager. Honestly, after three years of it, I'm not ready to return either. I only got paid $18 an hour and was stressed out almost every day with a big case load of clients. 

Since being laid off I probably applied to 30 different places. I lost count.  My mother is helping me as well. 

I've had no follow up phone calls and can't believe it's this hard. 8 years ago you could just walk in anywhere, hand a resume and get an interview same day. Now everything is online. No personableness at all. The only place that called me back was an entry level stocking position and they called and told me that they had other more qualified candidates (lol) 

Here's where my mother comes into play. She sensed me getting frustrated about the job search and will send me links of places hiring in the area. 

The problem is my mother is much old fashioned (she's in her 60s) and just thinks that I'll get hired anywhere because I have a Bachelors degree. Just yesterday she sent me a Supervisor position at a factory and said ""you have a Bachelors degree, you'll be at the top of the list of candidates."" Like mom another one just told me that they had more qualified people to stock the shelves. 

She gets upset when I say that I'm not gonna even apply because I'm wasting my time. She feels that I'm being lazy. We got into it and I thanked for the help but told her that times are changing and it's just not easy to get a decent job anymore.

81,1f2hown,AITA For having a hand in my gf and her bestfriends friendship ending,"Before I start I know how this sounds so let me explain. My GF (20 F) and I (22 F) have been dating for almost 3 years now. When we first started dating she had a best friend (20 F) since middle school lets call her C. C has a boyfriend of multiple years. When my girlfriend and I started dating I noticed how C would casually flirt with my girlfriend. The pictures they would post would have C casually grabbing my girlfriend ass or even cupping her breast over a shirt. I started noticing this and how she would blatantly do it infront of me and her boyfriend. 

When I brought it up to my girlfriend at the time she kind of brushed it off by saying she is my best friend nothing more nothing less. I kinda just pushed it under the rug after she said that to me. As time went on I started to notice more of the flirting and keep in mind it is only coming from C and not my GF. C started being very disrespectful towards me mentioning things like a member of my families health issues and comparing me to the most recent one of my GFs exes who is a horrible person (which my GF stated after that I am nothing like that.) C also stated that I was a rebound at the time of me and my GF meeting and that she was never really that fond of me ( which my GF stated after we left that that was not true). My GF would never really defend me in front of C. 

This turned into an all around toxic environment for everyone. There would be times my GF would plan a day with me and halfway into it tell me to take her to Cs because she wants to spend the day with her. C would be jealous that I got to spend weekends with my GF or anniversaries or holidays.  This led to a huge argument, I told my GF I was tired of the immaturity and jealously that it's not fair to any of us. I would try talking to C about the problem so my GF wouldn't be in the middle as much and C would instead go and talk to my GF instead of me. One morning I texted C and said that I want to handle everything maturely and not involve my GF due to the problem being between me and her that I feel like its an easy talk it out problem.

84,1f2h0f4,AITAH for not being totally supportive for my boyfriends new goal?,"Hi, I'll start apologizing for my English since I'm from South America.

Currently I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for two months now, we met at college and have been best friends for a year and a half before starting the relationship.
He's currently 22, but turning 23 in 2 weeks, and I'm 19.

The current problematic is that my boyfriend loves travelling and charity, he's very empathetic and good with dealing with kids. None of that is a problem by itself of course. The thing is that he's fixated on the idea of leaving everything in his life in orden to travel and help people in poor living situations, we're both law students (I'm on my second year and he's still on first year) and he works about 20 to 40 hours a week as a receptionist in a clinic.

I love traveling, even if I only had the chance to do so 3 times in my life for less than a week, and I told him I'll do my best to go with him and help, but here comes my main issue with all this: he wants the travel to be from march to june, and my classes for next year start in march.

I tried talking things with him, things that bother me and details about the trip:

Couldn't we go from december to march? (during our summer break) he doesn't want to because he says it's more expensive and that he wants to stop studying law (I want to keep studying)
Where could I charge my phone there? (he wants to put a camping tent in the middle of nowhere, I work as an entrepreneur and I need my phone to communicate with the events I work with and my parents in case of an emergency) He says that we'll find someplace and not to worry about
Why 3 months there? He says that the duration of the trip depends on the money he gets to save and that it could be 2 weeks to 3 months and that I should stop thinking so much

I tried suggesting helping people in other ways, like going to a ""comedor"" (a place to cook meals for homeless people or people that currently can't pay for food) or donating food or things we have that we don't need anymore. He wants to help a comedor from that city he wants to travel to, but I honestly don't see the difference of helping here, there or in other place.
I love helping too. I had donated food, toys and clothes to local organizations tons of times, money to a vegan community I adore that helps animals get out of abusive situations, promote shelters who need money or have pets up to adoption, etc. My problem is mainly not with what my boyfriend wants to do on the trip, my problem is that he isn't organized about how he's going to do it and that he dismissed my only request of going in december or january instead of march.

He says I make him feel guilty for making me drop my studies for a semester if I go with him on march bc he thinks is not fair that I do that for him and he isn't doing anything for me, but my solution was doing the trip earlier and he dismissed it totally. I don't know what to do.

85,1f2gvnc,AITA for not immediately helping an overly drunk friend home during a transit to a party that I was responsible for and leaving it to someone else instead?,"A while ago I (m24) and my two housemates (m20s) hosted a housewarming party at our new place. We planned a 2-3-hour pre-party, then headed out for a karaoke room downtown. There were to be about 20 people at the party, and I had pre-booked a large karaoke room (quite expensive, but I planned to split the cost among all attendees) to go to later that night.

Also, we had a couple of friends traveling from far away crashing on our sofa, since this was one of the big nights out of the year, which we all had anticipated for a long time.

I had done most of the planning (booking the karaoke room, figuring out public transport, timing) and felt overall responsible for the progression and facilitation of our party.

The pre-party went great, and by the time I announced it was time to head out, I was moderately drunk but happy and ready to sing my heart out.

While on the train to the karaoke, one of the friends staying overnight got sick and started vomiting. Another friend, who was also staying at our place, helped him to the train restroom. I assumed my sick friend would be okay after getting it out and didn't worry too much since he was in good hands.

However, the helping friend called me and said that they had gotten off at the current station and that the sick friend needed to go home. He asked me to either come take him or send one of my sober housemates to do it. I hesitated and suggested he could take him back himself since he had access to the key locker. This made my friend angry, saying I should be responsible for my guests. So eventually I agreed to talk to my housemates, but at that time the train had left their station. I talked to my housemates and one of them volunteered to go bring the friend home and relieve the helping guest. So we split and I led the rest of the group to the karaoke, paid, and started the night.

After about 3-4 songs the helping friend arrived at the karaoke, and the first thing that happened was that he asked me to step out to talk. He then scolded me for not personally helping him immediately, and for trying to urge him to bring the friend home himself. In my drunken state, I got really sad and cried a bit, since I just wanted everyone to have a good night and felt like I had disappointed my friend. I had to step out for a breath and then decided to just help someone else home, and ended my night right there since my mood had shattered anyway and they seemed like they could need some assistance anyway. In the end, most of the attendees (including the original helper) ended up having a great night out, spending the entire time at the karaoke. Not so much for me and my housemate, which got both our nights cut short.

So, AITA for not getting off the train immediately to take my drunk friend home and instead leaving it to someone else? At the time, I was admittedly selfish for wanting to continue the fun night and let someone else handle the situation, but I was also the organizer and felt responsible for everyone.",Asshole,2024-08-27,"AITA for not immediately helping an overly drunk friend home during a transit to a party that I was responsible for and leaving it to someone else instead? A while ago I (m24) and my two housemates (m20s) hosted a housewarming party at our new place. We planned a 2-3-hour pre-party, then headed out for a karaoke room downtown. There were to be about 20 people at the party, and I had pre-booked a large karaoke room (quite expensive, but I planned to split the cost among all attendees) to go to later that night.

Also, we had a couple of friends traveling from far away crashing on our sofa, since this was one of the big nights out of the year, which we all had anticipated for a long time.

I had done most of the planning (booking the karaoke room, figuring out public transport, timing) and felt overall responsible for the progression and facilitation of our party.

The pre-party went great, and by the time I announced it was time to head out, I was moderately drunk but happy and ready to sing my heart out.

86,1f2gs85,AITA? Neighbors Friend with Tourette’s ,"So. I like in a U shaped building. My neighbors diagonally across the alley from me had some friends over a few months ago and they were drinking. Around 10 pm I just hearing this dude yelling N bombs every 10-15 seconds. Hard R’s. This went on for at least 45 minutes. At this point I messaged the discord for the building and just shed some light on what was going on.

I yell out the window to shut the fuck up. Kid comes to the window beer in hand, and says what? Clearly drunk. I told him to shut the fuck up. Nobody wants to hear that. He laughed and said he has Tourette’s. I old him to shut the window because I didn’t want to hear that type of vulgarity. He turned to his friends and laughed and said he had Tourette’s. 

This part doesn’t have to do with the neighbor, but it’s baffling to me and I have to share it

A month ago I was on a flight. This guy asked me to change seats with his wife, so I did. I’m sitting next to this guy ( different guy) who seems pretty cool. Sure enough he starts dropping hard R N bombs while clearing his throat. Now, this guy clearly has Tourette’s, (and further more Coprolalia as I found out is the verbal tic). I felt horrible for this guy. 

Few days ago I get a message from Discord and it’s my neighbor. He said he wanted to clear the air and that his friend really does have Tourette’s, and it’s an involuntary tic. Given the whole circumstance of what happened  that night I really thought this kid was drunk where he was just saying something to get a rise, and just trying to pull one over on me. 

AITA? I was going to go apologize today but like, shouldn’t they have closed the windows? Maybe text the Discord before he came over warning the neighbors?

From then on, I told her I would do all I could to help support her while she maybe takes a break and helps herself heal. In the last couple of months, I fill out her unemployment weekly while she applies to jobs, I buy groceries every 2 weeks, I manage her money to an extent (she has problems with technology since it happened). I but her enrichment items, remind her to take her meds, have to figure out how to pay for her medicine, talk to her multiple times a day so she isn’t lonely, and many other things my adhd isn’t allowing me to remember. 

Here is where the issue comes in, she has a boyfriend (m60s) who lives with her and has a job. He pays absolutely no bills. He doesn’t buy food for the house, I recently found out they both eat mine. He doesn’t emotionally support her (he comes home at lunchtime, but never eats with her). After work, he comes home and immediately goes to the gym for 2-3 hours everyday.

Yesterday was a public holiday so we both had the day off work. I asked him if he had any plans or wanted to do anything (he got up far later than me), he said no so I said I'd go out and do some shopping like I had mentioned previously. 

He was OK with this  so I went.  I came back a few hours later, his car wasn't on the drive.   I checked my phone, no messages or calls.

He replied saying he was at his friend's house and would be back soon. I know his friend, he's a nice guy and I have no issues with him.

Anyway  he returned home and was in a mood, giving me the silent treatment. I asked him a few times what the issue was.  He replied that he didn't appreciate me trying to control him, where and when he went anywhere!

He’s new to the game but has started to take it more seriously, He’s also my only friend who’s really started to get into golf. I got fitted for a driver this year so I was more than happy to pass on my old club to him. I figured this would be a good motivator to get him on the course more. We got to the 18th tee box and like every golfer has done once (or twice) he went for the happy Gilmore swing and sent the club head straight into the ground probably a solid foot and half behind the ball.

Additional context. My driver also broke on the range before our round which does not help my case here lol. A little on my drivers situation, this is the second time in four months my new driver has broke on me. I have a toe miss and the torque being applied to the connection from the shaft to the club head hasn’t been able to take the abuse. The clubs been covered by warranty both times as the manufacturer agrees this break shouldn’t be happening. I’m a 6.4 hcp and hit the ball 300+, my happy Gilmore days are behind me. 

Now back to my buddy. After he gave the 18th tee box a new crater, I asked to hit his driver. I connected with the ball and it flew down the fairway. Sadly, so didn’t the club head and a part of the shaft. I felt terrible but we were in agreement that he had to have cracked the shaft when he hit the ground. 

The club head is still fine so all he needs is a new club shaft which you can order on Amazon for less than $100. But he won’t do it.

90,1f2f0ww,AITA for taking off my shoes in class?,"For context, I am attending a trade school in Australia, among a bunch of other men who are guaranteed to have spent most of their lives up until now wearing nothing but singlets, footy shorts, and flip flops outside of work. Nice people, but a rough, slightly unsophisticated, working class crowd. Not that I’m any different.

So, today in class, we were in one of the site classrooms doing quizzes about installing conductors and light switches on laptops. I was sat at one of the desks at the back of the room, and because it was stinking hot I decided to slip off my work boots, exposing my bare feet, which really helped to cool me. Again, I was up the back, and there was no smell, so I didn’t think anyone would notice or really care if they did.

Boy, was I wrong.

After a few hours, the guy sat at the front of the room giving the class was speaking to everyone about how to submit the quiz upon completion, and paused mid-sentence as his eyes, which had been sweeping across the room, stopped and fixed on under my desk. After what felt like the longest pause, he said “Are your… shoes off?” I said “yes”. He stared for another few seconds with a completely blank expression, like he couldn’t quite believe he was seeing what he was seeing. I said “I can put them back on if you want”. He said “That is disgusting. Put those back on. That is absolutely disgusting” as I hurriedly pulled my steel-capped work boots back on.

Now, needless to say, I was pretty embarrassed. And maybe it wasn’t okay for me to do. But what I can’t stop thinking about is the strength of his response. I thought maybe if someone did see my shoes were off and they had a problem with it, they’d just ask me to put them back on, and that’d be it. But my instructor reacted like I had my genitals hanging out or something. And now I can’t stop wondering if this is a major social boundary that I somehow managed to be completely unaware of until this point.

I’m so confused. Are feet a body part people think are gross? I’ve never heard them described as disgusting before. Do I need to feel retroactively embarrassed about every time I exposed my feet in front of people in the past, like at the beach, the local pool, or every time I invited friends over to my house and I was barefoot? Do I need to hide them from now on? I’m also surrounded by people who, like I said, basically live in flip flops when they’re not on a construction site, and it’s not like flip flops aren’t revealing.

Or is this a social taboo that’s contextual? As in bare feet are fine, except in a building or public space, where they’re majorly not fine at all, like having a breast out in public is fine if it’s to feed a baby, but without that baby it’s super not okay (maybe not a great comparison but hopefully you get what I mean).

So, is there something I’m missing here? Was what I did way worse than I thought? Or was my instructor’s reaction disproportionate?

Edit: I had only worn my boots for half an hour max at the point I took them off, 20 minutes of which I spent in an air-conditioned car on the drive to the RTO. They hadn’t spent hours marinating inside a sweaty boot, as some people are suggesting, and I can smell when my feet stink and there was no smell when I removed them from the boots 5-10 minutes into class.",Asshole,2024-08-27,"AITA for taking off my shoes in class?

91,1f2enz7,AITA for accepting a promotion and leaving behind family at a time of need after sacrificing so much in the past?,"**Background**

Almost a year ago, I shared on this subreddit how I resented my father. I found out he had secretly married a second wife. Although polygamy is permitted in my country, I felt angry and bewildered. Still, my father remained kind and caring, never mistreating us, and he worked tirelessly to provide us with a comfortable life. Before discovering this, I deeply loved him. Even though I despised his actions afterward, my love for him persisted. He truly is a caring and good man. Even my mother forgave him, and he's made great efforts to show that he genuinely cares about us.

Even if we harbored anger toward him, divorce was not an option due to our challenging circumstances:

My childhood was far from typical. I was sent to boarding school at an early age and lived on my own until university because my younger sister has severe non-verbal autism. My mother had to leave her job to take care of her. Now, at 22, my sister can only manage simple sentences. I'm 27, living with my parents, working remotely as a software developer, and helping to care for my sister, ensuring she takes her medication, including seizure medication.

**Now, the present situation:**

Recently, I was promoted to work as a tech lead at our overseas branch. Although there is still a remote work aspect, I need to relocate due to visa requirements and the need for in-person meetings. I accepted the offer and plan to move in September, in a few days.

A month ago, my father became seriously ill. I'm writing this from the hospital lobby, just two hours after learning he has stage 4 carcinoma. The doctors have given him 3 to 6 months to live.

For the past two hours, I’ve been reflecting on how my life has been shaped by external circumstances. I attended an all-boys boarding school because my parents were focused on my sister. I have low self-esteem with girls and have never been in a relationship. My understanding of relationships and love was shattered after discovering my father’s affair.

Most of my income supports my family, and when I’m not working, I’m caring for my sister.

It’s not that I don’t love my family—I do. But this feels like my chance to finally take control of my life. If I once again sacrifice myself for my family, what will be left for me? Is this truly my life? Am I destined to be a slave to the misfortunes life have in store for my family?

Just for once, I want to be selfish.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-27,"AITA for accepting a promotion and leaving behind family at a time of need after sacrificing so much in the past? **Background**

Almost a year ago, I shared on this subreddit how I resented my father. I found out he had secretly married a second wife. Although polygamy is permitted in my country, I felt angry and bewildered. Still, my father remained kind and caring, never mistreating us, and he worked tirelessly to provide us with a comfortable life. Before discovering this, I deeply loved him. Even though I despised his actions afterward, my love for him persisted. He truly is a caring and good man. Even my mother forgave him, and he's made great efforts to show that he genuinely cares about us.

Even if we harbored anger toward him, divorce was not an option due to our challenging circumstances:

My childhood was far from typical. I was sent to boarding school at an early age and lived on my own until university because my younger sister has severe non-verbal autism. My mother had to leave her job to take care of her. Now, at 22, my sister can only manage simple sentences. I'm 27, living with my parents, working remotely as a software developer, and helping to care for my sister, ensuring she takes her medication, including seizure medication.

**Now, the present situation:**

Recently, I was promoted to work as a tech lead at our overseas branch. Although there is still a remote work aspect, I need to relocate due to visa requirements and the need for in-person meetings. I accepted the offer and plan to move in September, in a few days.

A month ago, my father became seriously ill. I'm writing this from the hospital lobby, just two hours after learning he has stage 4 carcinoma. The doctors have given him 3 to 6 months to live.

For the past two hours, I’ve been reflecting on how my life has been shaped by external circumstances. I attended an all-boys boarding school because my parents were focused on my sister. I have low self-esteem with girls and have never been in a relationship. My understanding of relationships and love was shattered after discovering my father’s affair.

Most of my income supports my family, and when I’m not working, I’m caring for my sister. This promotion seems like my last opportunity to prove I’m not just a victim of circumstance, that I can live my own life.

92,1f2dvc2,AITA for starting fights with my mom?,"My parent’s relationship has always been awful, and it’s my mom working to earn money and holding up the house while my dad doesn’t do much other than watch over me. He has some anger issues and has really hurt my mom, which is always her reasoning for her bad temper. I’ve been out of the country most of life for school, and haven’t returned in around 5 years so this would be around the first time seeing my mom for such a long time. The thing that really shocked me was the fact she was really prone to anger. Whenever she’s in a bad mood or stressed out she treats other people around her in a harsh way. For the 2 months I was visiting I tried to get her to change her ways, and to mind her words when speaking instead of saying whatever she wanted. She always promised to change, but she would revert back to her habits when stressed out or in a bad mood. I always get really upset when this happens, because I want her to be a better person and I also wish she treated me better too. It’s not such a big deal the way she speaks but I just get very upset so I start scolding her and then it always turn into a giant argument after she gets set in a bad mood. She keeps telling me to not make anything into such a big deal and it’s all because of my dad giving her trauma and she can’t change it. She also keeps saying how she’s the only one in the household that does anything important and without her we wouldn’t be able to do anything so we should just be grateful and not bother her.

 I feel like this is all true and without her I wouldn’t be able to have the opportunities I have currently, but does that mean I don’t get to have complaints about her actions? I feel bad for the way my dad treats her but I also have issues with him too (obviously not as bad) but it never changed the way I treat other people. Of course I’m always grateful for her working, but I’m only in high school right now so I can’t have a job that can support her, so isn’t that argument unfair towards me? I also wish she would give a little leniency for me since I’m only 16 and I’ve always imagined my mom would be amazing once I visited her after so many years but it just hurt once I found out there were so many issues so I just expected better and that’s why I get upset so often.

I know the problem always starts with her talking to me harshly but AITA for getting upset and basically starting the argument after that?

Then in February I discovered that my favorite group, who had never come to my country, would be doing a concert in my country, not only that, it would be the first date since their debut in my country and the only date in continent throughout 2024, so no small occasion. Having heard the news, I immediately told her that I would try to buy tickets. Usually we always had the holiday last from June 20th to July 20th, but the concert would be held on July 12th and I couldn't afford an extra return trip to leave and return from the holiday home and so I told her that the dates of the holiday should have been moved from June 10th to July 10th. she got mad and told me that I was selfish and only thinking about myself and that I had ruined her vacation and blahblah, at which point I told her she was being immature. in the end I went to my concert and had a blast, and she arranged another way with her boyfriend (the problem of the new dates and that she wouldn't be able to live without him for three months), and we haven't spoken to each other for months now. 

AITA? 

However, to clarify, the house in Scilla belongs to my family, and I have been hosting her for exactly three years without charging her anything, except for the trip and her food. now just because I have another commitment and the dates slip is a good reason to throw away 10 years of friendship?

94,1f2dtmi,AITA for telling my best friend she needs to hire a nanny instead of relying on me?,"So my best friend is like my sister and we always help each other out when needed. She has a 10 months old baby and I have always been helping her in every way I can, but lately it started to be a daily thing. We live on the same floor next to each other and she calls me to watch her baby over everything. ‘i need to shower, can you hold him? ‘he is so bored, can you hold him?’ She calls me like multiple times a day to ask for a favour and now even when I don’t reply.. she comes to my house with her baby and asks if I can hold him.

yesterday I had some work to do on my laptop and she asked me to hold him for ‘10’ minuts cause she wanted to take a quick shower. I agreed for 10 minuts and that turned into one and half hour.

Mind you, her son is really not an ‘easy’ baby. Cries uncontrollably the moment you put him down and try to play with him. So I am forced to walk for like one and half hour with him in my arms while I have other things to do…

Anyway yesterday I felt lightheaded while walking around with the baby.. so I put him down while trying to distract him with some toys.. he kept crying so loud, but I couldn’t take him cause I was worried I would drop him..

She heard the ‘crying’ and knocked my door in a ballistic angry way.. saying why do you let him cry? I explained to her the situation and also told her that its her fault for not disciplining him and letting him play on his own.. Ive babysitted a lot of babies in the past and none of them were like this.. it’s not the baby’s fault. It’s def hers 

She was like: I don’t like to ever hear my baby cry and I do not accept that you let him cry either. That really pissed me off.. so I went on like: Then you should hire a nanny that will fulfil all of your requirements…

Extra info: nobody of her family, including her mom, want to ever help her out cause of the fact that they can’t put him ever down… not even for a second.
Also: her husband has a very well paying job.. they can easily afford to hire help

Thirdly.. I absolutely do not mind helping her out and I love her baby, but I do not like when it’s like a ‘must’ and she even gets angry when I don’t do it ‘her way’.

Side-note: I always do it her way.. just yesterday it was taking too long and I was just concerned about his wellbeing.. as I had already fainted a couple of days ago

when helping out someone feels like an obligation I immediately don’t want to do it anymore.. am I being an asshole?

95,1f2derz,AITA for telling my dad's he's crazy if he thinks I'm going to his house during the week just to make food for his stepkids?,"My parents are divorced. I (16m) now live with mom and visit dad every other weekend. The change happened about a year ago. The judge won't let me stop going on those weekends but I wish I could. I have a younger brother (14) and a younger sister (11). My dad's married and has a stepson (10) and a stepdaughter (7). He asked me a couple of weeks ago to come to his house after school and make food for them before going home. He asked this because he found out that I sometimes make food for my siblings when mom works. He asked me about it the next weekend I was over there. He wanted to know why I never did that at his house. I said I just didn't. He told me I could have made food for all four of the kids. I told him no, that wasn't happening. He asked why and I said because I don't mind making something for me and my siblings but I'm not making food for just anyone. He told me his stepkids are my siblings too just not by blood and I told him they're not my siblings and I never said they were.

Then two weeks ago he asked to go and cook for his stepkids after school. This is during weeks my siblings are home with me and mom and weeks they're with him. I told him no and he made that weekend annoying as fuck. My mom told him to leave me alone, I'm a kid, and I already chose not to keep 50/50 custody so he'd want to cherish the time he has with me. He told mom to shut up.

I didn't do what he asked. He then mentioned it to me Sunday and that's when I told him he's crazy if he thinks I'm going to his house for the week just to make food for his stepkids. He told me if I can do it for my siblings I can do it for them. I told him I love my siblings. That's why I do it. Then it was like he focused on me calling him crazy and he said it's not crazy to expect family to treat each other the same and how I'm showing blatant favoritism for my blood siblings and not my siblings through marriage. He told me it's cruel to be so blunt about it.

96,1f2cxg8,AITA for leaving with a friend while my grandmother is dying of cancer?,"Prefacing this by saying I’m bad with tone so please do not be sarcastic with replies, I tend to take things seriously. Also my time with my friend was confirmed with my mother and their parents around two weeks before it was decided we would visit my grandmother during that time, as my mother is rather capacious.

My Grandmother was recently diagnosed with cancer (I’m afraid I do not know the specifics) and I have been told she will likely not live to see the next summer. Still, I chose to go with my friend. 

There were a few reasons for my choice. One, being around my mother makes me feel terrible. I hate the feeling of needing to tiptoe around my words in fear. I can’t go into specifics because of this subreddit’s rules. Her actions have toned down in recent years, but that has only led me to stress because I can’t tell if I should block or not. So of course, the chance to get away from her was highly welcome.

Second, I’m outstandingly bad with people. I’ve never really understood how to interact, provide comfort, and so on. Even getting a friend has always been impressive for me, and they always approach first. Apparently it can be endearing, but is more often than not annoying. I have been told I’m overly blunt and rude, though I don’t necessarily understand. I’ve gotten in trouble for telling my grandmother “I have trouble talking to people who don’t share my interest” when I was younger, in an attempt to explain why I couldn’t really engage in conversation like my brother. Yet I got in trouble for it. So going to see her in a delicate time seemed iffy at best. I don’t even get relationships on the level everyone else does, as even in my younger years I saw all dynamics (family, friends) as transactions, where people use each other. So emotional intimacy was never my strength, as even if I like someone I need to rationalize our dynamic.

Three, I have a particular need to follow a schedule. Not super strict as my mother is rather capricious and she decides what I do most of the time, but not following the schedules I have is really stressful. Since my vacation with my friend was decided upon, confirmed, then planned by me, canceling it would be incredibly difficult, on a mental level at least. 

So I went on the trip with my friend. I did my best to provide my condolences and sympathy to my grandmother. And since I’m bad with words that was through a gift. I bought her a crochet flower, then wrote her a letter expressing my apologies I would not be visiting her. I even told her I would catch a fish in her honor, which is a lot to me, as for whatever reason I really like fish. So catching one and dedicating it to her would be like sharing my most treasured item.

But still, people seem to think I made the wrong choice, so Reddit, AITA?

98,1f2c5qu,AITA for telling someone I (28M) didn't want to babysit my girlfriend (24F),"Two weeks ago I went to a high school friends wedding, he's never met my girlfriend but still extended a plus one to me incase she would like to come since he knows of her. I didn't even bother mentioning the plus one to her because I knew she wouldn't want to go, she knows nobody there except for 1 girl she met one time (Lily) and Lily's boyfriend. The rest of the guest list was just the bride and groom's family + a bunch of high school friends. 

Anyway, wedding rolls around and I go. Lily asks me where my girlfriend is and why she didn't come I said 'I didn't want to babysit'. I meant it as a joke as in if she had come she would be glued to me the entire time as there was nobody else there that she knows.

I mention it to my girlfriend in passing today and she was visibly upset when I told her that I said that to Lily. She said it makes her look bad. She also said that I should have told her about the invite, I asked her if she would have even gone, she said no. I said what's the point then?

AITA for telling Lily that I didn't want to 'babysit' my girlfriend at a wedding where she didn't know anyone? 


Edit: Thank you everyone for all the comments telling me how big of an AH I am, I needed it. I took my girlfriend out for brunch, had a good talk, and I apologized. I told her going forward I will extend all invitations to her and be careful of saying things that paint her in a bad light. She is an amazing woman and what I said was not cool at all. She accepted my apology and we are good now.

To clarify a few things, we've been dating for years, no we aren't breaking up over this, yes we both love each other. 

She has accompanied me to numerous weddings, I don't force her to always stay at home. 

I was not trying to meet an 'old high school girlfriend'. The groom invited only male friends from high school so it was me hanging around my old crew (no girls). The groom isn't going to invite high school girl friends to his wedding. 

I truly didn't mean to hurt my girlfriend but I did and I accept that what I said was wrong. Thank you!

99,1f2bba3,AITA for telling my gf’s best friend to kick rocks," I 28 M and my gf 25 F have been together for 3 years. I’m not big on men and women being friends, not because of women but because men don’t respect boundaries and are not as sexually disciplined as women, it’s just a fact. Anyways when I came into the picture and got more serious with my girlfriend she introduced me to her best friend, really her only friend but he was a guy. 
 I wasn’t fond of it whatsoever but I let it be because it was so early into the relationship and I didn’t want to seem too overboard. We’ll call her best friend John, John was a very respectful guy, never made me feel uncomfortable spoke very proper, had a lot going for him and overall just carried himself very well, I have nothing bad to say about the guy. They spoke very often on the phone shared memes etc and he even came to our baby shower. 
 One day something in my gut told me to ask my gf about there past so I did. When I got home I straight up asked her, “ hey was there ever anything between you and John.” She was like a deer in the headlights and my heart sunk. Mind you she’s about 6 months pregnant at the time and we’ve been together about a year at this point. Obviously hormonal she’s starts to cry and the conversation goes south.
 She told me that John and her were friends with benefits for about two years after that they cut things off and just remained friends. I told her I felt disrespected and that this is definitely I should’ve been aware of from the start and I don’t feel comfortable with this “friendship”. There’s obviously some sort of chemistry there, if there’s ever problems between her and I who is she going to talk to ? What do you think he’s gonna think about me when those ugly type of conversations come about ? All these things are racing through my mind at this point on top of being angry because I feel disrespected. Needless to say I personally told John that I know about there past and whatever he thinks this is, is no longer and he isn’t around anymore. Side note, I still have to see him almost everyday because he goes to my gym at the same time I do. So AITA for reacting this way ?

100,1f2b996,AITA for asking the flight attendants to reinforce security rules ,"I flew business on a short Europe trip with a dedicated empty seat between passengers.
When she arrived, the passengers next to me put her backpack on this seat next to me, she also had a small crossy purse and paper shopping she put next to her feet,
she then plugged her phone. 


After boarding, the plane went quickly to the runway. I expected the flight attendant to ask her to put all her belongings under the seat in front of her. When passing, she just asked her to unplug her phone. I waited for the FA to be back to see if she was going to reinforce safety measures but she sat, so I did press the call button.


**First the hostess told me the big backpack was totally safe on the seat** and there was nothing to ask, I did insist firmly and the passengers finally put only the backpack under the seat when I was asking her to put the 3 bags, the plane was about to takeoff so I gave up but told the FA I was going to file a complain.


After take off and a full 30/40 minutes of ascending, all lights on, **the cabin manager** went to the front, stayed very long, passed back and forth a few time and then ask me if I was doing ok. I answered that I was feeling unsafe about the non reinforcement of safety procedures. She asked if I had a problem and **was accusing me of having aviophobia**. I fly almost every month to be able to see my close family, kids, husband, parents (I wish I could fly less). I never had aviophobia. I answered that I don’t and that security measured were to be reinforced, she said I should not be bothered by a paper shopping bag next to my feet, I said luggage must be stored under the seat in front of you is a sentence she did repeat a thousand times, she answered she knew her job better, I said in this case I will include her in my complaint, she left saying **she was going to report me!!!!!**

I told her that there was originally a big backpack on the seat! That I didn’t insult her and just answered her questions.

It’s the second time I have someone leaving things on this empty seat, last time it was a company employee traveling for work, I just had to give him a look and a simple gesture and he collected his ipad, not very keen though.


I was supposed to fly again a long haul with the same company on Sunday that I canceled, i’m not sure I want to fly again with this company before I get an explanation. I filed a complaint but didn’t get feedback after 4 days.

101,1f2a1yb,AITA for sending the email?,"Obligatory not me... also on mobile

I (26M) work in retail. As with many other retail positions we have a hierarchy of supervision (I'm at the store level.)

Tonight, closer to the end of my shift, my printer ran out of toner. I had made a joke about it earlier so, I guess I jinxed it. But the printer is super important as I have a boat load of paperwork to put together every night. So I called my Store Manager. 

They told me where to find the extra toner, but the size was totally different. We have the commercial sized printer and commercial sized toner. This reload was personal sized. No worries, what do we do now?

My SM tells me to contact whoever is the next available person in the hierarchy, so I do. So far I've been calm albeit a little worried about my paperwork.

This person then calls another person, and suddenly we're playing telephone. I'm told to send a message in the app we use to communicate with each district. I take pictures and send them along with a plee for toner. 

At this point I'm beginning to wonder why they're having me ask this if toner is usually a corporate expense for stores. 

In the app, my boss's boss replies that I need to send an email. I take a screenshot of the entire chat and, with the help of a little corporate lingo, send it in an email. 

I'm noticing that the District manager is having me, someone two levels down, explain and pander to an entire district of my peers, in order to pinpoint a store that has what I need, so that my DM can go another day to pick it up. Like... what? That's your only job isn't it? Why am I doing half of it for you? 

When I got home and told my wife, she said sending the email like that was petty. And while it was a bit lazy for the DM to use me, it is also kind of my job as I'm on the clock at the time.

102,1f29wia,AITA for inviting my friend’s brother instead of him to a convention?,"Okay, so every year I go a multi-day long gaming convention and the past few years, I’ve been taking a friend (mf) and his brother(jp) with me. We’ve gone to several different conventions with all 3 of us together and never had an issue. However, this past year’s convention happened and mf had gotten on my nerves so badly, that I didn’t want to invite him to another outing ever again. 

Mf and Jp showed up at my place a day before we were leaving for the convention and mf had zero money. No money for the hotel, no money for food, and no money for activities. So I ended up bank rolling through the whole thing. Normally, I wouldn’t particularly mind if he had told me before hand, but he lied to me about it and only found out when we got there. He did eventually pay me back, but it was pulling teeth.

Throughout the convention, Jp and I were pretty much inseparable. We did everything together. Enjoyed the convention, partied with other friends, and had a blast together. We really tried to include Mf in everything we did, but Mf wanted to spend most of the time in the room. 

The day comes where the convention is ending and we eventually have to leave. Mf wanted to go meet a girl he matched with on a dating platform. Cool! Great! I specifically looked him in the eye told him not to take off for hours. 2 hours and then we have to head home. He agrees. Mf turns his phone off and we can’t get a hold of him. 5 hours later, he finally calls saying he’s picking up his stuff from my car. We waited for this dude for another hour in this empty parking lot. He shows up finally, barely says anything, and takes off. Jp and I had an absolute shit fit the whole way home. 

Fast forward to now where I have to plan details for the next convention. I reached out to Jp asking if he was on board and we both agreed to exclude Mf from the plans and not invite him. 

On one hand, I feel like a jerk for going behind mf’s back and devising a plan to go around him and on the other, I feel so burned from this past time. I did try to talk to him about it, but was met with complete indifference. While we are still friends, but I judge that he doesn’t appreciate any of the work that goes into planning, paying for anything, or considers anyone else that’s in the group.

103,1f29k6m,WIBTA if I had my brother walk me down the aisle at my wedding instead of my father,"My (29F) dad (61M) is particularly sensitive, but also an objectively terrible person. We were close when I was a child/in my early teens, but alcoholism consumed him. He became verbally abusive to my brother, mother, and I. He has also shown up (on the rare occasion he does show up) to every important moment in my life wasted (for example, my college graduation). It’s embarrassing. I’ve made my feelings known to him yet he never changes.

He recently became “sober” around three years ago. In quotes because no one in my family believes him (he has relapsed many times before this and tries to hide it). We don’t talk often. When we do, it is usually a random text from him about something typically politically charged without context. We don’t have similar views, but it seems he wants me to agree with him - I never do, and this always causes an argument where I cease responding.

My brother (32M) is one of my best friends. Throughout our traumatic upbringing, we’ve been emotional rocks for each other. We still talk every day and he’s the kindest person I know. He has a worse relationship with my father than I do. 

My dad left my mom a while ago after cheating on her numerous times. He ended up getting together with my now stepmom. She’s nice - they just got married. My brother and I found out they got married after it happened, because she included us in a group text with her whole family where she sent a graphic announcing their marriage. My brother and I were shocked - this was in the middle of the day on a Thursday. We didn’t even know they were engaged. Later that day I called my dad to congratulate them. After congrats, I asked if he was going to tell me or my brother. He said “Maybe. Probably.” Despite my poor relationship with him, I had always voiced my support of his relationship with now stepmom. He knows I appreciate her presence in his life; she knows too, which is why I was so taken aback.

I told my brother that I was upset. I’d like him to walk me down the aisle when I eventually get married. Brother said he would but also said this would probably deeply hurt our father’s feelings and I should reconsider. Sorry what? I brought up how terrible he was throughout our upbringing, what he did to our mom, etc. Bro said he knows, he gets it, dad isn’t a good dad/person, but something like this would devastate him. “Dad loves us, he just loved booze more.”

104,1f29h55,AITA for showing up at my ex's house to seek information after he started ignoring me? ,"**Hello, everyone! I'm ready for feedback, so feel free to roast me if necessary.**

I (29F) had an almost perfect relationship with my ex (31M) for six months before he broke up with me due to mental health issues, substance (weed) abuse, and fear of commitment. The breakup was complicated because it wasn’t due to a lack of feelings or incompatibility—we were close and on good terms. Although I disagreed with the breakup, I respected his need for space and kept a low profile, even though I was hurting a lot inside. He mentioned several times that he wanted to stay in touch and maybe try again once he felt healed and better.

I left the country for a few months and only tried to contact him twice before going into no contact. Two weeks ago, after returning, I casually texted him to see if he would be up for a drink. He didn’t respond, but he watched my Instagram stories. I let the weekend pass and then sent a second message and called him, emphasizing that I didn’t want to be intrusive, but I was genuinely interested in hearing how he was doing. I also made it clear that I’d be happy to hear from him whenever he felt ready. Still, no response. Instead, he did something odd—he's usually not active on social media, but he posted a couple of things, seemingly knowing I was waiting for a reply.

I know this isn’t ideal, but having struggled with depression myself in my early twenties, I understand that people can act strangely sometimes, and I shouldn’t take it personally. However, I felt disappointed—not just as an ex, but as a friend—and I wondered about the sudden shift in our dynamic. We never fought, and there’s no unresolved tension from the breakup. I could even handle it if he was seeing someone else.

I’m not sure what changed in my mindset, but I decided to write him a message and show up at his place to figure out what was going on. Obviously, he didn’t open the door and refused my call. Still, I calmly expressed my concerns and asked why he had suddenly gone silent. It might sound pushy, and maybe I was, but I had respected all his prior requests and didn’t feel respected being ignored in return. When faced with silence, I didn’t want to be left in a situation where he might reappear months later, explaining his disappearance.

I know there's a world where I should have just let it go, but I couldn’t—I both wanted to know and also did not feel like it was ok to ignore me. Lastly, while I don't care too much about my crushed ego facing a closed door (lol), somewhere it was also about maintaining my sense of agency,if that makes sense...

I left the country for a few months and only tried to contact him twice before going into no contact. Two weeks ago, after returning, I casually texted him to see if he would be up for a drink. He didn’t respond, but he watched my Instagram stories. I let the weekend pass and then sent a second message and called him, emphasizing that I didn’t want to be intrusive, but I was genuinely interested in hearing how he was doing. I also made it clear that I’d be happy to hear from him whenever he felt ready. Still, no response. Instead, he did something odd—he's usually not active on social media, but he posted a couple of things, seemingly knowing I was waiting for a reply.

I know this isn’t ideal, but having struggled with depression myself in my early twenties, I understand that people can act strangely sometimes, and I shouldn’t take it personally. However, I felt disappointed—not just as an ex, but as a friend—and I wondered about the sudden shift in our dynamic. We never fought, and there’s no unresolved tension from the breakup. I could even handle it if he was seeing someone else.

I’m not sure what changed in my mindset, but I decided to write him a message and show up at his place to figure out what was going on. Obviously, he didn’t open the door and refused my call. Still, I calmly expressed my concerns and asked why he had suddenly gone silent. It might sound pushy, and maybe I was, but I had respected all his prior requests and didn’t feel respected being ignored in return. When faced with silence, I didn’t want to be left in a situation where he might reappear months later, explaining his disappearance.

I know there's a world where I should have just let it go, but I couldn’t—I both wanted to know and also did not feel like it was ok to ignore me. Lastly, while I don't care too much about my crushed ego facing a closed door (lol), somewhere it was also about maintaining my sense of agency,if that makes sense...

106,1f29fse,AITA for making my boyfriend distance himself from his family?,"I’m 21 years old and my boyfriend (19) have been together going on four years now. I loved being around his family at the beginning of our relationship. Let’s call his parents Susan and Mark and my boyfriend, Jack for the remainder of the story. Susan had Jack and his twin sister during her senior year of high school. Susan was a single mother of twins at 18. I have always got along with her and she is still super nice to me. Then comes Mark. She has been married to Mark now going on four years. Literally a month before Jack and I started dating

Mark is the most controlling, manipulative, POS I’ve ever had the displeasure of meeting. When Jack and I were in high school, when we wanted to go grab food after a sports practice, we were always told to “ask Mark” or “you know how Mark feels when you don’t ask him” by Susan (whom at this point has been married to for less than a year)

Mark always made stupid rules that got worse after they got married. He made them (at 17-18) turn in their phones to him and make them go to bed at 9:30. Seniors in high school. They were not allowed to eat/drink anything other than at the kitchen table, even when they have TWO dogs on the house that, I kid you not, have a designated crap rug in Jack’s sister’s room. They just put a lot of their responsibilities on them I feel, especially Jack. They didn’t make his sister do a lot solely because she was a girl

Moving on to when I moved out of my parent's, Susan and Mark let Jack come visit me once a week. Jack cannot come because he’s watching is little brother (who is 13 at the time) and apparently cannot stay by himself for 1-2 hours until his sister gets home. So I text the sister “what time will you be home?” Not even TWO minutes later Jack is calling me mad at me because I texted her. In that TWO minutes Mark called him chewing him out telling him he needed to “grow a pair and get (me) under control.” I’m furious. I don’t know if I was more mad at Mark or Jack for getting mad at me when I clearly didn’t do anything wrong. I realized Jack was angry at me because he was scared of Mark and didn’t want to get in trouble

What was really the last straw for me, he went through Jack’s UNDERWEAR DRAWER.  I cannot listen to how this man is treating the person I love the most in this world and gets away with it. The worst part? Susan knows and does NOTHING. Jack has told me a few times that she was different before meeting Mark and I truly wish I had the privilege of meeting her then

The real kicker here, Mark is like 2 years younger than Susan’s FATHER. Mark is older than Jack’s grandmother. There is a 20 something year age difference

I could go on all day and night of little things that Mark does that just rubs me the wrong way. I genuinely feel gross and sick every time I even see the man.

107,1f296l2,AITAH for not forcing my fiancée to wear my father's late wife wedding dress? ,"

My father lost his first wife (I'm going to call her Mia) more than 30 years ago, It is a very long and complicated situation but to summarize it: my mother is the second on his heart because he's always said that the love of his life is Mia and he always made it clear. My dad still wears his wedding ring with Mia in one hand, my mom bakes a cake for her birthday, my mom leaves my dad alone when it's his anniversary with Mia and he's feeling down, there are many photos of Mia in the house, there are even photos of her in their room because my father never wanted to change them, etc. As crazy as it may seem, this kind of thing is very normal within couples of this type and they see that as something normal and sweet even if it is not, for example, making a cake every Mia's birthday was the idea of another woman who is also married to a widower and does the same thing. 

I've been raised that way, kind of having two mothers... Even if it wasn't like that. It was not a healthy childhood but luckily I have gone to therapy to work on all the issues that this caused. 

My mother always says that he gives her the space she deserves and feels equally loved like he loves his first wife, my silbings and I don't see it that way because our mother deserves better, but if she is happy we will not ruin her happiness so we never talk about it. 

Now, coming to the problem; I'm going to marry my fiancée, her mother never had a wedding ceremony so she doesn't have a wedding dress to inherit so my girlfriend excitedly told me that she thinks it would be cute to ask my mother if she can use her dress. My mom has mentioned that in the past and I don't have any sisters so I thought it was a nice idea.

Anyway, I talked to my mom about lending her dress to my fiancée and she got really excited and said yes. My mother had spoken several times about wanting to have a daughter to wear her dress and she was very excited when my fiancée asked her to wear it, she even tried it on. That conversation was closed.

Now, almost a month after we talked about it, my mom asked my fiancée that it would be nice to wear Mia's wedding dress. My fiancée told her no, she feels a connection with my mother and not with Mia, she doesn't even know Mia. 

After that my mother has been asking me to try to convince my fiancée to wear Mia's dress, My father wanted me to put up the typical decoration to commemorate the deceased, but I told him I won't do that, so my mother now wants my fiancée to wear Mia's dress to commemorate her and for her to be present too because she was someone really special(again; I never meet her, I don't know who she was. My fiancée told me that Mia is a total stranger to her). My fiancée wants my mother's dress, she wants to give her a special place at the wedding since my mother sees her as a daughter and she as a second mother and wants to have a special moment. 

 I told my mother that I don't intend to do that, it even seems gloomy and weird to me but I have been raised around Mia's memory that sometimes I don't even understand if I am exaggerating or not. Aitah? Being raised in this kind of way sometimes makes me feel confused about what is normal and not in a family, it would be normal to ask my fiancée to wear Mia's dress in my family dynamic, but I don't know what someone who was raised normally would do and if I am a bad person for not wanting to have done it.

110,1f27xbj,AITA for pointing out my in-laws manipulation when my husband wouldn’t,"My husband and I have been together 5 years. His parents have never been a fan of me, particularly his mom. As he has grown older, their relationship has become strained and distant due to their extreme difference in beliefs and she blames me. 

We moved away 3 years ago and are now back to our hometown. My in-laws were great in helping us tour rentals in person since we were across the country. Soon after solidifying a condo, his mom began to message him several times about designing our yard, wanting to fix it up before we moved, ect. We were very understanding of her excitement and gentle with our response: waiting until we move since we haven’t actually seen the place yet to begin with, and there’s an HOA that we were not familiar with yet and didn’t want to accidentally cause a problem off the bat. This is when she told us that she had already gone to the HOA anyway about what she wanted to do, without telling us. After our third decline on the offer, she was noticeably annoyed but dropped it at that. 

Fast forward to us moving in. We reach out after a couple days, asking if we could have them over after settling in and getting their opinion on some smaller touch ups to the house. Her response was out of left field. She responded saying that she had planned to plant us a garden, buy us a washer/dryer, stock the kitchen; but since we had asked her to wait on the garden she no longer wanted to help in any degree. Mind you, this is the first time that we had heard about any plans beyond her wanting to fix up the garden. 

Since then, she has brought this up manipulatively at each time we see each other and she still finds ways to add into messages with my husband. For example, at family dinners. I am a much more confrontational person than my husband and have kept my mouth shut to avoid adding any turmoil to their relationship, until today. 

Mother-in-law messaged my husband today about having a bunch of plants that she doesnt have space for and wants us to take, because she had already purchased them for our garden before asking our permission to pursue the project, explicitly adding blame on our part for this. Mind you, this is now approaching 2 months from the original request that we asked her to wait. 

I’m pretty fed up. I end up responding to her about this being constant manipulative commentary and baseless blame. She is predictably very defensive and upset as a result. My husband is not upset with me for speaking out but is getting the heated responses from her as a result.

We have asked them many times to pick up their dogs shit and when we ask them they will go get a bag and pick it up. we’ve seen them on our ring cameras not picking it up and I will just pick it up and ask HOA to send out a reminder.

His girlfriend forced him to pick it up after coming outside After he said he would ‘fuck us up’ when my husband stepped in to ask him again to stay out of our side yard if he can’t pick up after his dog

This is a new construction town home community starting around 350k, we put a lot of savings into buying our first home

Contacted both HOA and the owner of their townhome, who then put me in contact with their property management company.. find out they’re not even supposed to have dogs per their lease agreement (oops) and I was assured it would never happen again

They have 4/5 adults and 4kids living there.. one of the other men in the home (on the lease who got the phone call) came over after work and said it was his sisters boyfriend, apologized was embarrassed that they would act that way and said they have an inspection now this week said the boyfriend didn’t even know what an HOA is.. they’re only supposed to have X amount of people on their lease and were now threatened with eviction because of the dogs and more people than stated living there. 

WHY COULDNT THEY JUST PICK UP AFTER THEIR ANIMALS. Walk them on the side walks to common areas (dog bag trash cans provided!) or around the pond, even their own back yard! I would never want anyone out of a home but we maintain our home/yard so our kids can play freely without stepping in dog shit. We have a dog, ALWAYS pick up after her I couldn’t imagine being so entitled to just let her shit be everywhere Am I crazy?

It’s a townhome community. we have neighbors who NEVER pick up after their dogs and walk them in our side yrd. We have asked them many times to pick up their dogs shit and when we ask them they will go get a bag and pick it up. we’ve seen them on our ring cameras not picking it up and I will just pick it up and ask HOA to send out a reminder. 

Today I caught them again walking their dogs in our side yard and both dogs pooping.. they walked away I popped my head out ‘ya going to pick it up?’ SILENCE .. ‘you going to pick up your dog shit?’ Silence again.. asked a little louder and they said ‘no we don’t have to’ outside I go to confront these assholes. They then say everyone here are renters (we are not).. who cares if there’s dog poop here it’s no one’s property (again it’s ours with zero cut through).. we don’t care if there’s dog poop why do you?

Eventually she started talking to me again. She made money this summer to pay rent to my mom and pay for her car stuff each month. But she never did any of that all she did was buy food. Fast forward to this morning first day of school I'm a sophomore now and she's a teacher at a different school.

116,1f27cu4,WIBTA if I asked my fiance not to spend time with our neighbor?,"My fiance (22m), who we'll call Tim and I (19f) moved into our flat a year ago. Recently a new neighbor (40ish m) (let's call him Sven) moved into the same house with his family. He is a cook at the restaurant underneath our flat. 

For context: a bit ago Tim had a mental breakdown, due to mental health issues he didn't talk about to anyone. Out of irrational fear and his mind shutting down, he put his phone in the mailbox and ran away. He was gone for 24 hours, easily the worst time of my life. He spend some time in a mental hospital after this and the issues has been solved. He does have a therapist and has been in therapy for years.

After this the comments from Sven started. He keeps repeating how it's bad to run away and how Tim should never do that again. The way he does that gives me the ick. ""Don't run away again. Don't do that to us. Everyone was worried. You can't do that to us again.""

We hadn't actually talked before the incident. Ever. He doesn't actually know us and we've been in several situations where he kept repeating that same thing. 

Yesterday he invited us to sit by a campfire with his family. Up to this point I thought he was nice and convinced Tim to go downstairs with me. 

Svens family did not show up. He kept talking to us, but it wasn't really a conversation. Tim never talks much with strangers. I usually do most of the talking and help him get involved. Not this time, because Sven did not let me speak. He kept cutting me off and telling me not to speak so much about myself, even after asking me questions about me. He also made some very uncomfortable, hurtful comments, like: ""people who cut themselves just need to talk about their issues. "". After this comment he pretended to not have known that I used to hurt myself, even though my scars are very visible and I don't bother covering them up. Everytime I said something, he either said something like: ""me too!"" or told me to shut up. He also started mocking depression and anxiety disorders the moment I said I suffered from them. 

To Tim he was nothing but kind, polite and understanding though, and he offered to go hiking and do sports with him. Tim loves hiking and sports, but I don't, so having someone to do it together would be great for him.

After feeling unwanted for a while, I claimed, I'd go to bed and left. Shortly after Tim came upstairs too. We agreed that this situation was very weird and he asked, if I would prefer if he didn't hang out with Sven. Honestly, I don't want him to, but I made it clear, that this was his decision. Now, this guys comments (there were more) are keeping me awake and they still make me feel bad in my skin.

118,1f26qs9,AITA for not wanting my fiance to spend time with our neighbor?,"Hey everyone! I'm really upset right now and it's keeping me awake, so I need to get this off my chest:

My fiance (22m) who we'll call Tim for this and I (19f) moved into our current flat about a year ago. Pretty recently a new neighbor (40ish m) moved into our house with his family. We'll call him Sven. Sven is a cook at the restaurant that is in the same house we live in. 

We hadn't talked a lot until, due to mental health issues he didn't talk about to anyone, Tim had an emotional breakdown, put his phone into our mailbox and ran away. We did have a small argument before this incident, but it was nothing fatal or important. 

I feel it's important to point out that he has not been on any substances or alcohol. He just acted out of irrational fear and his mind shutting down, due to his mental illness.
 
That night was the worst night of my life, I spend it crying and praying non-stop, even though I hadn't prayed in years. 
Save to say the 24 hours he was gone were awful and send me spiraling into depression quickly. 
Now, after Tim was found, physically well, he spent some time in a mental hospital and we worked out the issue. We have been better since then. He isn't having any issues right now.

Recently Sven started actually talking to us. He keeps saying how worried everyone was when Tim was gone, never acknowledging or even asking for my perspective. He just keeps coming up to Tim, just to tell him to never run away again. It feels like he is making our issue, that had nothing to do with him and that he did nothing to solve except keeping his eyes open, his very own issue. It also feels, like everyone in the house is blaming me for what happened, even though Tim himself assured me many times, that even though we had that argument, the problem lay way deeper and it was not entirely my fault and could've been easily solved if he had just talked to me. 
Sven seems to be pretty convinced it was my fault though. He never even asked what actually happened, he just assumed. 

By now, Sven has made comments about it and Tims mental health to my social worker too, in front of another neighbor, which was very uncomfortable. 

He also came by a few days ago, to ask for a cup of flour. While I filled him one, he kept repeating what felt like a demand to Tim. ""Never run away again. Talk to me, but never do that to us again. Everyone was worried. Never do that to us again."" 
I could tell Tim was uncomfortable, but Sven just didn't let me step in like I usually do in these situations. Tim and I later talked about it and he said, he didn't like Sven. I actually encouraged him to give Sven a chance, because I want Tim to make friends in the neighborhood and come out of his shell a little more.

Yesterday evening Sven came by to give the cup back and ask for two potatoes. Then he invited both of us to come to sit by a campfire he had made in his garden, with his family. Tim wasn't sure about going, but I thought it was a great chance to get to know our neighbors better, so we went downstairs. Svens family did not show up.

He started talking about the dangers of being out and about in the woods without a phone again. Tim didn't talk much, which he never does with strangers. Usually I do most of the talking in these situations and make sure to involve Tim. This usually works very well for us, except with Sven it didn't, because he just wouldn't let me talk. He even asked me questions, just to cut me off after one and a half sentences. It was very clear to me he actually didn't want me there and just invited both of us out of politeness.

 Sven went on talking about how he fully understood all mental illness we could have, because he is a former drug addict and has been in prison. He also said some hurtful things, like: ""people who cut themselves just need to talk about their issues."", then pretended he hadn't known I used to selfharm, even though it's summer and the scars on my arm are very visible most of the time. He also started mocking depression and anxiety disorders, the moment I mentioned I suffered from them. He never mocked anything Tim said and seemed very understanding of him. I eventually gave up and left, saying I was going to bed. I was really a bit angry, but mostly upset then.

 It's about 4:30 am as I'm writing this and it keeps me up, because his comments (he made a lot more) made me so uncomfortable and uneasy in my skin.
Now, the issue is that Sven offered Tim to go hiking together and do sports together. Tim really likes those things and it'd be great if he had a buddy for that.

When he came upstairs, not long after me, Tim agreed with me that this situation was weird and asked, if I wanted him to not hang out with Sven. I told him it was his decision, but I must admit, I don't want him to. Sven just makes me really uncomfortable and gives off weird vibes. He also feels like the type of man that thinks mental and physical illnesses are only bad when men have them, but that's my interpretation.

119,1f25ivd,"AITA for not ""reminding"" my friend about an upcoming event?","I'll exclude some details to keep some things private.

This included me (30sF), my boyfriend ""Eric"" (30sM), and two of my friends around my age. We went to a big event this past weekend that is a pay-to-attend sort of thing. I've been excited about going for months, and told my other best friend ""Kelly"" (30sF) about coming along. She got excited and really wanted to come as she's never been to events like this before. She's a sweet person , and seeing her happy makes ME happy. Kelly doesn't have a car yet, so I'd be doing the driving, which is all good by me. She often gives me gas money too.

Eric also has a car, but he gets uneasy driving in dense areas, so he'd also be riding with me. He got his ticket over a week ago. Cool, and I've been waiting to hear from Kelly.

Since a few months ago, I've been running ideas by Kelly in case she wanted to dress up for the event with me, or do her own thing if it made her more comfortable. She had lots of ideas and I gave my opinions as requested, and suggested other tried-and-true options to her. I've reminded her about the event on and off, and she keeps saying she'll get her ticket and see if her boyfriend, who I'm also friends with, wants to come too.

Well, Kelly still hadn't mentioned anything to me about the event unless I asked her, and I got the same answer. Rinse, repeat for months until a week ago. Since she hadn't made a decision, I took that AS her decision not to go. My group and I went, had a great time, got some neat stuff.

Day one of the event, Kelly texts me later in the afternoon asking to hang out. I texted back ""I'm at the event with Eric and friends, remember?"" She replied ""OMG I forgot about that! Why didn't you remind me??? I wanted to go!"" Holding back my urge to say exactly what you, the reader, would say, I told her how we've been talking about it for months, and her inaction on the matter told me she didn't want to go. I even offered to buy her ticket in advance if she paid me back later (she's always paid me back for things before), but she refused before. Good thing.

Now Kelly is really sad she missed the event and has been a bit cold toward me. The only reason I feel like the AH is because though I wanted her to come, I have zero sympathy for her. All this time she's known about this event, and she just ""forgets"" the week of? I'm sorry, that just doesn't fly with me. I've sent links, texted prices, suggested where to eat.

120,1f251xc,WIBTA if I confront my aunt about feeling tricked into giving up the room I was sleeping in to my cousin?,"
I (20M) have been staying at my uncle and aunt's vacation home during summer break for about three weeks. During this time, I’ve been sleeping in my cousin’s (21M) “room”, as he was on vacation elsewhere. He had initially said he wouldn’t be back until the end of summer, but then said he’d arrive tomorrow.

Yesterday, my aunt mentioned that she had a friend coming over to visit (she never mentioned who) and asked if I could move out of the room to accommodate her. I immediately agreed and moved all my stuff out, thinking it was for this friend. It turns out that the ""friend"" was actually my cousin, who decided to surprise everyone by coming back earlier than he had told everyone, with my aunt being the only one in on the surprise, and didn’t tell anyone else. Now that my belongings have been moved out, he made himself comfortable in the room, and I’m now sleeping in the attic.

I feel like I was tricked and misinformed into agreeing to give up the room. If I had known it was for my cousin, I would have asked him to sleep somewhere else or maybe have a proper discussion about it, as the room isn’t strictly his (it’s a vacation home with plenty of other places to sleep, and we all pretty much sleep in different places, but I prefer his room, because it’s the only available marital bed that fits me because im a pretty large dude). I probably would’ve agreed to let him sleep in the room after a night, so I could’ve moved my stuff myself. Instead, I was told it was for a someone else, and because I wanted to be polite and accommodating I agreed to move without a fuss.

I understand how this wasn’t intentional on my aunts part, as she was mostly doing it for the surprise. However, with me being left in the dark in all this, I feel like my feelings were unintentionally pushed aside and not taken into consideration. In short, I feel like I was treated like a child. I’m not one to complain a lot or to make my feelings heard, but I cannot stop thinking about what happened tonight and wondering if I was actually wronged, and I feel like if I don’t get this off my chest, it’s going to leave me bitter.

Or should I just let it go since it was supposed to be a surprise?",Asshole,2024-08-27,"WIBTA if I confront my aunt about feeling tricked into giving up the room I was sleeping in to my cousin?

124,1f24g5c,AITA for cutting contact with my family due to the burden they've caused me?,"When I think about my childhood, everything is divided into two parts: before and after Camilo. Until I was ten, it was just my sister and me, growing up in my mother's shadow. She was never a warm woman; on the contrary, there was always some sort of tension in the air whenever she was around. It was like we were walking on broken glass, always careful not to make the slightest noise, afraid we might wake her fury.

But when Camilo was born,  
things changed in a way I never imagined. Suddenly, my mother became a  
different person… although not for me. Camilo was the center of the universe.  
""He's a boy,"" my parents would say proudly. And instead of feeling  
jealous, I just wondered if they would ever look at me with the same eyes full  
of tenderness.

Since I was little, my  
curiosity always got me into trouble. I remember one time, when I was about  
seven or eight, I became fascinated with my mother's makeup. She kept it in a  
drawer of her vanity, and I couldn’t help but be drawn to the colors and the  
sparkle. One day, while she was busy, I dared to open the drawer and touch one  
of the containers. I had barely picked up a lipstick when the door burst open.  
My mom grabbed me by the arm, and without a word, dragged me toward the vanity.  
Then, with a coldness that still chills me, she slammed the drawer shut on my  
fingers. The pain was unbearable, but even worse was the feeling of betrayal.

As I grew older, the  
abuse became routine. There were no warnings, just punishments. If I got sick  
and threw up, she made me eat the food again. She hit me with whatever was  
within reach and always told me the same thing: ""Don’t tell your father,  
or it’ll be worse.""

My dad… he was different.  
He worked all day, and when he got home, all he wanted was to rest. But the  
weekends were his time to be with us. I remember the trips to the park, the  
times he bought me ice cream, the little things he did to make me feel loved. I  
lived for those moments. But everything changed when Camilo was born. My dad  
decided to start working from home to be closer to him. Although he was still  
kind to me, something had shifted. It seemed like everything revolved around my  
brother, and somehow, I ended up being his babysitter. Afternoons that used to  
be mine turned into hours spent taking care of Camilo while my parents reminded  
me that I was the oldest and that, being a boy, he had more needs. My dad,  
without malice, reinforced the idea that women should serve men, and although  
he said it casually, those words hit me just as hard as my mother's abuse.

With time, I noticed  
something else. The distance between my dad and me kept growing. The days of  
park visits and ice cream became less frequent, and when we sat down for  
dinner, he barely looked at me. His attention was always on Camilo, and  
although he tried to tell me he still loved me, I couldn’t help but feel like I  
no longer mattered to him. The moments when I used to feel his love became few  
and far between, and my heart, already wounded by my mother's abuse, started  
breaking from the growing distance with him.

One day, while Camilo was  
learning to read, he made a mistake, confusing the letter B with D, and my mom,  
as usual, lost her patience. I already knew that look in her eyes; I knew what  
was coming next. I saw her raise her hand, and before she could touch him, I  
stepped between them. I don’t know what pushed me to do it. Maybe it was  
exhaustion, maybe the desire to protect Camilo, or maybe I was just fed up. My  
mom stared at me, shocked, and grabbed one of her heels. I felt the hit before  
I could react, but this time, something inside me broke.

Instead of backing down,  
instead of cowering like I always did, I hit her back. It was instinctive, but  
also liberating. I looked her in the eyes, and for the first time in my life, I  
saw something I never thought I’d see in her: fear. It wasn’t just the hit that  
affected her, but the fact that I, her daughter, had dared to defend myself. I  
knew it wouldn’t be easy after that, but I also knew that from that moment on,  
something had changed. I would no longer be the same fearful girl I had been  
for so many years.

But the hardest part was  
the loneliness that followed. My relationship with my dad kept deteriorating.  
As Camilo grew older, my dad became more and more involved with him, teaching  
him things he had never taught me. He told me it was ""because boys need to  
know these things,"" as if I didn’t have the right to learn them too. And I  
sat in silence, swallowing my tears, because I knew that, somehow, I had lost  
him too.

Currently, I live far  
from my family. I decided to put kilometers between us because I felt it was  
the only way to save what was left of myself. My memories are filled with pain,  
and although I try to move forward, the truth is it's not easy. For a long  
time, I thought that the physical and emotional abuse from my mother was all  
that had marked me, but I realized that the control went beyond the beatings  
and the shouting.

As I grew older, not only  
did I become emotionally distant from my father, but I also began to understand  
how, in a way, both of them had pushed me into a bottomless pit. My family,  
with its demands and expectations, left me deeply in debt. Everything I earned  
went into trying to pay off those debts and just trying to survive. In the end,  
I realized that they had drained everything from me, even my dreams and my  
energy.

Today, I look ahead and  
don’t know what to do. I’m a professional, but sometimes I feel like an  
imposter, a child trying to walk in an adult’s shoes. I feel lost, aimless, and  
the heavy burden of my debts follows me day after day like an unrelenting  
shadow. I can’t help but think that no matter how hard I fight, I’ll never get  
out of this hole I’m in.

On top of that, I  
struggle to relate to others. Despite not being unattractive, I feel like the  
least valuable woman. I have trouble having deep conversations because I don’t  
know what to say or how to communicate. Loneliness overwhelms me, and the fear of  
rejection paralyzes me. Social interactions feel like a minefield, and I often  
opt for silence to avoid the pain. The weight of this emotional distance with  
others makes me feel more isolated, as if I’m fighting a battle alone.

There are days when the  
weight is so overwhelming that, in my desperation, the thought of ending it all  
crosses my mind. I know I shouldn’t feel this way, I know I should be stronger,  
but sometimes it’s hard to find reasons to keep going. I’ve spent so much time  
carrying the pain, the guilt, and the expectations of others that I’ve  
forgotten how to live for myself. I feel like I’ve failed, and that feeling is  
suffocating.

And yet, here I am,  
fighting with each day. I tell myself that I can’t let it all end like this,  
that there’s still something in me worth saving. But the truth is, I don’t know  
how to move forward. It feels like everything I do is just to stay afloat, only
