And I don't have my own money. My parents were stopping me for the past 2 years with transition saying I should graduate first. I'm graduating in September and then going to another studies. And my parents told me to go to work. My major was music education. I completely burnt out for the past 5 years studying it.

1,1f3o84w,AITA for making a jab at my friend's husband without realizing the situation? ,"My friend(35F) and I met in college and I asked her to be one of my bridesmaids. I only had 3 bridesmaids coming which includes my sister and my now husband originally had 8 because he had 2 brothers but we cut it down to 6 so the numbers on each side didn't seem to out of wack. I had been a bridesmaid to my friends wedding 4 years ago.

She lost her job last year when she agreed to be my bridesmaid and was working as a contractor when had planned the events for. She told me she couldn't be there for the overseas bachelorette as it would have required her to take time off and her time off as a contractor was unpaid. She also declined going wedding dress shopping. I was really disappointed and she ended up only going to the wedding. I did tell her how I really wanted her to come and did say to her that with her husband being a doctor I would have assumed she didn't even need to work if she didn't want to let alone not even being unable to take a few days off. For the wedding only she was there as she said her husband needed to watch their son and I will admit I was kind of sad because when I was a bridesmaid I attended her bachelorette and my now husband was with me at their wedding. I just felt like it was common curtesy.

I posted our bridesmaid photos from the trip after the wedding along with the wedding photos and tagged everyone. She responded saying it looked fun and I said she should have been there. Then she called me like a day later and angrily told me to stop trying to make her feel guilty about not attended and making her husband out to be the villain. She basically ranted that her son has a heart condition and her husband was working parttime to take care of him so she was the breadwinner which is why she couldn't afford to miss work. She said that the insurance company won't cover their claim for the surgery and didn't consider his case severe enough and so they did the surgery without preauthorization for better results so now they might have to cover a very expensive medical debt. I was shocked and said I was sorry I had no idea and she said she didn't want to tell me because I was the bride and she also didn't want everyone to know her son's condition but I was so annoying by making it seem like her husband wasn't letting her do things when he sacrificed more because she made more with working the same hours. I actually thought they were rolling in money because of him and had no idea she was the breadwinner though this.

So a little back story, I, (22,Female) moved out of my parents house when I was 18. They where really religious along with my other siblings and it was getting to the point where my older sister was going though weird bouts of religious psychosis and instead of helping her they just stuck up for her. I just couldn‚Äôt keep living with them like that. I started college which helped to get me started on my own as I got money from a program, not long after, about a year late I was able to find a really good job. It was nothing huge but he paid the bills and let me continue going to school comfortably.

A little less then a year ago I no longer qualified for the program that gave me money, it was no big deal thanks to the fact that I still had a job, but not four months later did my job lay me off. Iv been scrambling to get a job while still saying in school to get my degree. So far the job search has gotten me no where. This month I used the last of my savings to pay my bills and now I‚Äôm broke.

Iv tried talking to my family, trying to get any support I can from them but have gotten almost nothing. Not even a ‚ÄúI understand‚Äù . 

That being said I‚Äôm preparing to possibly be homeless in the next coming month, I‚Äôm still trying my best to get a job by then. I have really bad anxiety and this is just making everything worse.

Lo and behold my sister in law (25) is pregnant. Married to my oldest brother (26) Me and her don‚Äôt really have a relationship. We are more acquaintances than anything else. I hardly see them or even talk to them, maybe once a year at family gatherings. We don‚Äôt even live in the same state anymore. 

About two months ago I was invited to her baby shower, but because I was already dealing with all of this stuff I declined the invitation she sent online. Now I didn‚Äôt tell her like I have my parents, but I know for a fact that her and my mom gossip and talk a lot, maybe even more then she does with me, her own daughter.

I woke up yesterday to a long text from her demanding an explanation as to why I declined the invitation to the shower. I straight up told her that I didn‚Äôt have the money to fly down to her state, and that I had no job and was possibly about to be homeless. She said a simple ‚ÄúOh I‚Äôm sorry to hear that, we are always here for you.‚Äù and left it at that.

It‚Äôs the next day and I‚Äôm waking up to a nasty message from my mom, along with other family members saying I‚Äôm Asshole. Saying that I shouldn‚Äôt have said all of that to her, that I was ‚Äúmaking it all about you‚Äù, and that I should have lied to her because she‚Äôs pregnant and all.

Hi Reddit, I turned 18 (female) yesterday but it seems to caused a bit of drama in my family so im asking for honest, objective opinions on whether im wrong. I‚Äôm using a throwaway account because this situation is obviously very humiliating for me

For reference, my weight has always been made fun of in my family. My aunt specifically has always been very unkind and fat shamed me, even when I was younger and struggling with my body image. She used to tell me that my clothes looked so small on me, and that even her clothes are probably small for me. She used to remind me to go on diets constantly. Im currently 320lbs if it adds contexts too 

I hadn‚Äôt seen my aunt in a while and for the most part I was really glad to see her for my birthday. I was slightly dreading if she would say anything to me because im aware I have gained a lot of weight since I last saw her, but she just made a few comments so I thought it was the end of it. 

I was opening a birthday card she gave me a few hours later and it had money in it, with a note that said ‚Äúmoney for weight watchers, make some real change for once‚Äù. This was humiliating and I asked her about it and she said that she could tell I was miserable and that I probably look really good underneath the fat. She said this in front of my parents, and it was very embarrassing. I told her im not accepting the gift and she‚Äôs making me look stupid, but she said that she was just worried for me and my health. I don‚Äôt believe this, she‚Äôs made fun of my weight for years even before I was a teenager. But my parents think I was overreacting and I should‚Äôve just accepted it.

She doesn‚Äôt have her own car and has been relying on public transportation, but it‚Äôs been a hassle for her since the bus schedule doesn‚Äôt align well with her work hours.

I own a car, which I use mostly for running errands and the occasional weekend trip since I work from home. My sister asked me if she could borrow my car during the weekdays so she can get to work more easily. She assured me she would take good care of it and cover the gas. 

I initially hesitated because I‚Äôve always been protective of my car, and honestly, I don‚Äôt trust her driving skills that much. She‚Äôs had a couple of minor fender benders in the past, and I‚Äôm worried that something could happen to my car. Plus, I‚Äôm used to having the freedom to use it whenever I want without having to coordinate with someone else.

When I told her I wasn‚Äôt comfortable lending her my car, she got really upset. She accused me of being selfish and not caring about her struggles. She even said I was lucky to be able to work from home and not have to worry about commuting, and that I should be more understanding of her situation. 

Now, our parents are also involved, and they think I‚Äôm being unreasonable. They‚Äôre suggesting that I at least let her use it for a couple of months until she can save up for her own car.

She posted countdowns of this trip on IG several times, so I asked ‚Äúdo you have your tickets yet?‚Äù  I just don‚Äôt understand the logic of putting countdowns on social media and then doing absolutely nothing to make that trip happen. 

Well obviously she waited too long to get her tickets and they were unaffordable. She started looking for them 7 days before this trip was meant to happen. And then she kept trying to change the dates of the trip to get the cheapest tickets, but 

1) my accomodations weren‚Äôt refundable 
2) I have a job to get back to, I can‚Äôt just change my PTO that has been scheduled for months a week before I‚Äôm meant to leave,
3) people put me in their plans, I didn‚Äôt want to bail on them or ask them to move things around. 

Honestly it just pissed me off because I warned her. Even 2-3 weeks ago I told her she may have to cancel on this trip because she didn‚Äôt have her tickets yet and she just said ‚Äúnah‚Äù. 

Anyway, now she‚Äôs trying to come see me for another weekend. To her credit she does understand that another trip to the south isn‚Äôt happening. But she doesn‚Äôt understand why I wont ask for the first weekend of September off (first week back at work, I‚Äôm head of housekeeping, I get Sundays-Mondays off anyway). 

I can tell from her responses that she‚Äôs mad at me, but she can‚Äôt say anything. She‚Äôs taking about October/November to meet up and says she‚Äôll let me know when she‚Äôs free so we can meet up. But frankly I don‚Äôt really care at this point in time. I don‚Äôt wanna put down a weekend and work on my staff plannings just to have her bail coz she can‚Äôt get her shit together and realise that almost everyone her age is now a working adult.

3) people put me in their plans, I didn‚Äôt want to bail on them or ask them to move things around. 

Honestly it just pissed me off because I warned her. Even 2-3 weeks ago I told her she may have to cancel on this trip because she didn‚Äôt have her tickets yet and she just said ‚Äúnah‚Äù. 

Anyway, now she‚Äôs trying to come see me for another weekend. To her credit she does understand that another trip to the south isn‚Äôt happening. But she doesn‚Äôt understand why I wont ask for the first weekend of September off (first week back at work, I‚Äôm head of housekeeping, I get Sundays-Mondays off anyway). 

I can tell from her responses that she‚Äôs mad at me, but she can‚Äôt say anything. She‚Äôs taking about October/November to meet up and says she‚Äôll let me know when she‚Äôs free so we can meet up. But frankly I don‚Äôt really care at this point in time. I don‚Äôt wanna put down a weekend and work on my staff plannings just to have her bail coz she can‚Äôt get her shit together and realise that almost everyone her age is now a working adult. 
And frnakly, I‚Äôd rather spend a weekend with my man than with a friend who bailed. 

So I know I‚Äôm being hurt and petty atm. But AITA for not asking for the first weekend of September off and not being excited to block off a weekend in October/November.",0.0,0.0141484094783663,0,1

He‚Äôs worked full time, overtime as much as he physically could to afford himself a plane ticket to come visit me (very nice by the way the visit was great) but at the last minute we decided to move in together a couple thousand miles away into his place. 

His house was a huge mess since he‚Äôd been disabled for a year with a horrible back injury from being in the Fire Academy, and severe depression so I happily cleaned it up spotless over the course of a week while he was away at work.

Before I get to the point, About two months before we started dating he would always complain about his Female coworker, how horrible she was how much he hated that she is Polyamorous, etc. I never thought too much about it and gave him comfort about it. 

Two weeks after we started dating long distance, all of a sudden they were best friends and are spending private time alone together, sitting together in their car at lunch and he wouldn‚Äôt text me or call me at that time when he normally would when he was alone; because he‚Äôd preferred to be alone so he could talk to me on the phone. 

**Flashforward three months later** 
Something didn‚Äôt feel right about how all of a sudden they were best friends again, so I asked him to let me look into their Snapchat PMs. His response was, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt let you do that, it would mean breaking our **NDA** contract.‚Äù Of course I was skeptical of that, so two weeks later I fly back home and cut contact.

We have been living together in the upstairs apartment of his grandparents house the entire time paying rent.  His mother lives in the basement apartment of said house.

My boyfriend and I have always talked about owning a house together in the coming years as we have saved up a good amount of money for being fortunate enough to pay discounted rent considering the family home. However, those plans have now changed and my boyfriend says he wants his mother to move into the new house with us as it would be cheaper since she will have inherited money from the main house whenever they sell it.

It was odd because there was no sign of it being broken since the light was on and the screen was on and there wasn‚Äôt a sign or anything so from afar it looked like it was just a normal register. 

So, I was going to go back to wait in line but I saw that the guy next to me was finishing up and just needed to get his receipts so I wasn't sure if I should make my way back to the line or just wait for him to finish and then I can check out right there. Additionally, it would have been super difficult for me to get back in line as the people behind me had big carts (THAT WERE BLOCKING THE PATH TOO!!!) and I would have to navigate through them again. So I was standing there for a couple of seconds trying to figure out what to do looking very uncomfortable and confused. However, an older woman (70+F) behind me finished during this time and started telling me off and then the employee caught wind of that and asked me what I was doing.

It felt super condescending and like I didn't know simple etiquette. Also, I think it was kinda rude for the employee to ask what I was doing and then immediately disregard my response while I was trying to explain.

15,1f3ko7a,AITA for Putting a Poop Bag in Someone‚Äôs Bin?,"This afternoon on a walk with my two children (almost 4y, almost 6m) and my dog. I had my youngest in the push chair, the dog on a lead, and my oldest on a scooter. As we were walking, my dog stopped to poop. I had a bag, I picked up the poop, and then carried it with us while I pushed the push chair and held the lead.

Tomorrow is bin day, so there were loads of bins already out for collection. When we walked by a bin (which had its lid slightly ajar as it was quite full), I popped the bag into the bin and carried on.

About five houses down, my oldest wanted to stop to collect some rocks, so we stopped. While we‚Äôre stopped on the sidewalk, I see this old man stomping up the road behind us, the bag of poop I just threw away swinging from his hand. He shoved it toward me and spat out ‚Äúput it in your own bin next time!‚Äù

Would he have preferred I picked up the poop and then just tossed the bag into the gutter or just off the path like a lot of people in our neighborhood do? Or not pick it up at all, like a lot of people in our neighborhood do?

I didn‚Äôt set a single foot off the sidewalk to get to the bin. It‚Äôs not like I walked onto his property. The bin was on the sidewalk, ready to be collected tomorrow morning. But he‚Äôs so disgusted that there‚Äôs dog poop in a bag in his bin that he got it out of the bin and carried it half a block away to give it back? 

I‚Äôm convinced that because we stopped and he caught up to us sooner, that it was actually his intention to throw it at me or something, but I made eye contact with him while he was approaching, so he confronted me instead. 

Anyway, I was too stunned to say anything. I wish I had. But it really shook me up that someone would be that weird and that confrontational in front of my children. I felt quite vulnerable being out with three beings in my care and just wanted to quickly turn off his road out of his sight so he couldn‚Äôt find us again. It really scared my oldest as well.

AITA here?

ETA: Our bins are collected every week. The truck uses an arm to dump them, it‚Äôs not the trash collectors throwing the bags in one-by-one. It‚Äôs not that hot here right now.

That being said, I get it. I‚Äôm the asshole. I wouldn‚Äôt care if someone used my bin on bin day, but that‚Äôs me. If I did care, I probably wouldn‚Äôt stalk someone down the road to shout at them, but again, that‚Äôs just me.

I‚Äôm convinced that because we stopped and he caught up to us sooner, that it was actually his intention to throw it at me or something, but I made eye contact with him while he was approaching, so he confronted me instead. 

Anyway, I was too stunned to say anything. I wish I had. But it really shook me up that someone would be that weird and that confrontational in front of my children. I felt quite vulnerable being out with three beings in my care and just wanted to quickly turn off his road out of his sight so he couldn‚Äôt find us again. It really scared my oldest as well.

AITA here?

ETA: Our bins are collected every week. The truck uses an arm to dump them, it‚Äôs not the trash collectors throwing the bags in one-by-one. It‚Äôs not that hot here right now.

That being said, I get it. I‚Äôm the asshole. I wouldn‚Äôt care if someone used my bin on bin day, but that‚Äôs me. If I did care, I probably wouldn‚Äôt stalk someone down the road to shout at them, but again, that‚Äôs just me. 

Lesson learned. Thanks guys. ",1.0,1.0692371129989624,1,1
16,1f3kak7,AITA for commenting on the evil beard?,"My (28F) boyfriend (27M) has styled his beard the same way since I met him - up until recently. Last week, he changed it into what he has termed ""the evil beard"". 

Now, I'm not fixated on appearances, and facial hair is not a deal breaker in a relationship. However, it was a bit of a shock that he showed up like that, because I was so used to how he looked before. It kind of feels like he's a different person - even though I obviously know he's not. 

Today I saw him for the first time since the change and I commented on that, saying it would take me a while to get used to the evil beard.  He didn't understand, and accused me of being superficial - even though I reassured him he still looked great. 

He then asked Chat GPT if a person is still the same person after shaving, and when Chat GPT said yes, he got smug about it. He says it's proof he was right. I don't think this is a fair argument, because that's not my point at all.

I am a 18yo college student. The way I dress is pretty normal. I like cute dresses and skirts , they make me feel pretty (I have important body image issues) .Sometimes , when I'm feeling fancy , I make some funny and more colorful outfits. No one cares about that beside my mother.

My mother is pretty strict and have pretty..""bland"" tastes (In clothing , decoration , everything). That's just how she is and I have no problem with that.

However , it seems like she has a problem with the way I dress. Everytime I have an outfit that she doesn't like , she just HAS to point out what is wrong (in her opinion) with it and urges me to change. Here are some (real) exemples :

* I wore socks in my espadrilles
* I layered a corset (handmade) with a dress
* I wore a checkered jacket over a floral dress
* I wore a cropped hoodie
* I wore a hoodie with Isoka (from an anime) on it
* I had too many color in one outfit
* I had 2 different pattern in one outfit
* I didn't wore a bra
* I wore childish socks

The list goes on.. While I wouldn't mind if she did that every once in a while (Like , when I have to dress up good for a special occasion) , her doing it everytime is really bothering me. I told her I didn't liked it when she did that but she keeps going EVERY SINGLE TIME she is not happy with my outfit for wathever reason she found.

I am done being critized , she seems to think she is some kind of fashion expert and I really dislike that. Life is not always a fashion show. When I'm chilling at home , I want to be able to wear whatever clothes I see first when I open my closet.

So , last time, I snapped. She critized my outfit again (Because my dress was too long to her liking). And I told her I didn't gave a shit about her opinion. Now she is mad at me for being so rude when she is ""Just trying to help"".

I know this conflict is pretty tame , I'm just annoyed. I have self confidence and body images issues. I was probably too harsh but I think she should just stop bothering me with that.

My step son has a sleuth of mental problems, PIKA, opposition defiance disorder, adhd, tourettes syndrome and ASD. ( Autism ) 

He has decent communication skills but very low executive function ( can't dress himself, can't wipe himself act. Ect ) and problems with anger and regulating emotions

So my gf couldn't work as much and almost no one in the family is willing to help watch him bc of his behavioral problems or everyone elses need to work in today's economy. 

We have gotten by but it's really putting me in bad financial situation. I struggle to make my child support, rent and car payments bc when me and my gf firsr agreed to live together we agreed she would cover about 30% of expenses.. she can barely afford 10%.

One example of 100s is this. 
I'll be chatting with gf about a new video game and she will absolutely love it and I would have a different opinion on it and jokingly explain why it's bad in a way that would make her laugh and her son will take it so seriously that he behins to have a meltdown to points where he slams doors, breaks things and screams at the top of his lungs over a social que he just didn't get.. he wasn't even involved or brought into the conversation. As a father I try so hard to help him regulate his emotions and rationalize the situation but he just curses at me and threats to leave or force his mother to leave me. I understand he is being irrational but after three years this is taking a toll on my heart and even my body ( he has gotten physical with me and I refuse to engage with him in that way ) 

When he calms down and comes to his senses we all just have to pretend it didn't happen, or he will go on another meltdown war path.

I try to discuss my feelings about this with my gf and she typically either rolls her eyes or shifts the blame on me or worse comments how my kids can get on her nerves and misbehave sometimes. It's infuriating.

I feel a lot of this has to do with the fact she basicly has given up on him in getting him behavioral help. Bc he has been kicked out of so many programs or they cost something just about no one can afford or have time for while trying to make it in this economy.

He's not developing any social skills and is basicly be raised by brain rot youtube memes and micro transaction pseudo gambling. My step son actually stole her credit card and racked about 200$ of micro transactions on one of these stupid tablet games. We struggled for food that month bc of that. 

I feel another contributing factor to why my step son and I don't get along is bc of his world view of men and men in authority. This is large to do with his biological father. I'm not going to get too much into him but long stroy short this guy never pays his child support is almost never there for his son and when he is he is incredibly cruel to his son.

AITA for forgiving my birth mom before my birth dad?

I (19F) was raised by my grandparents, who I call my parents. When I was younger, I was manipulated by my stepsister into moving in with my birth father. Living there was difficult. My birth father always favored my step-siblings and adopted siblings, and I often felt like I didn‚Äôt belong.

One day, my stepmother forced me to stand in front of a mirror wearing a crop top that belonged to my stepsister, which made me incredibly uncomfortable, all I wanted was to understand why I couldn't wear one too ( I wasn't a skinny kid, I never had body issues prior to moving in with them). once My stepsister later lied to my birth dad, telling him that I and my adopted sister had been physically fighting. This wasn‚Äôt true at all. My birth dad got furious, grabbed both me and my adopted sister by our throats, and slammed us against the wall. My adopted sister had multiple fractures in her head from past accidents while playing outside, making this even more dangerous and traumatic.

After the school year ended, I moved back in with my grandparents. I confided in my aunt about everything that had happened, and she believed me and supported me. Years later, I finally told my mom (my grandma) about the incident. She told me I should forgive my birth dad because he‚Äôs now a ""changed man.""

During this time, I had also reached out to my birth mom while I was in therapy. My birth mom had struggled with drug abuse in the past but has since gotten help. In therapy, I was diagnosed with BPD2 and PTSD. With time, I was able to forgive my birth mom for not being there when I was growing up. However, I‚Äôm still struggling with forgiving my birth dad for the abuse I went through.

My therapist has told me that I don‚Äôt have to forgive him if I‚Äôm not ready or don‚Äôt want to, but my mom keeps pushing me to do so. I‚Äôm trying to heal at my own pace, but I can‚Äôt help feeling conflicted.

So, AITA for forgiving my birth mom but not my birth dad?

23,1f3iyey,WIBTA if I make my child apologize for his actions against another student? ,"
My son (m 11) started his first year of middle school a few weeks ago and seems to really enjoy it. He‚Äôs making new friends, learning more, and wanting to involve himself more in clubs. Several of his friends live in our neighborhood, so it‚Äôs not uncommon to have a few children in our yard playing however recently one of the other child‚Äôs parents approached my husband about our sons behavior towards his daughters(f 8 and f12).

As it turns out my son has told a classmate and her younger sister they are no longer welcome over and he had said a few mean things to the youngest daughter. My husband said he was aware of this and approved of our son‚Äôs actions. Apparently, the youngest child had started teasing our son when she and her sister had a treat to make our son feel excluded while also mocking our sons new hair cut and soccer team (bad winning record). 

My husband told our son that he should tell the younger sister to stop and explain she was being mean and hurtful. That didn‚Äôt work, so our child went to the older sister and asked her why she didn‚Äôt intervene when her little sister was being a bully. He apparently warned her that if they didn‚Äôt stop he would be mean back.

Well, they started making fun of him again so he started mocking the younger sisters psoriasis and telling her he wanted to play connect the dots with the spots on her skin to see if he can make the Big Dipper and now kids are calling her ‚Äú constellation.‚Äù 

The parents were very furious with us and reported this to the school. My husband again told them they were warned and he was not going to allow his child to be bullied by anyone and he was expects him to stand up for himself because ‚Äúgive‚Äôem an inch and they‚Äôll take a mile.‚Äù

The school could not discipline our son because his role happened outside of the school and school hours, but I feel terrible. I think he needs punishment and I‚Äôm getting mixed reactions from other parents on what happened. I think my child went too far while my husband thinks he went the right amount because the bullying has stopped and the bully knows what it‚Äôs like now.

25,1f3iohb,AITA: I threw something out that didn‚Äôt belong to me then lied about it.,"So, I‚Äôll be as brief as I can. But context is important here.

So my mom has two terminal illnesses, and is in the final stage of both. 
In her house lives the rest of my family. My younger brother (call him Alex), his fianc√© (Mary), and my elder brother (Matt). 

Now, Matt pays for about 80% off all bills. My mom pays what she can, but most of her money is for medical needs. Alex takes care of mom, and Mary does a lot of the chores. 

My primary concern was to 
1: Take care of, and hang out with mom.
2: Do anything I can to ease the burden on everyone.

Soon as I got there it was obvious everyone‚Äôs stressed tf out. It affects how they treat mom too. No one is appreciating what each other is doing and at each others throats, more or less.

So I get a list of chores and do what I can for the week. I first have a family meeting of sorts. Telling everyone they need to respect the effort everyone is making because they aren‚Äôt. They agreed. So. I then do what I can to make space because with four people and four dogs the space is a little cramped. So I focus on making space. So there‚Äôs a big ass box containing a swing chair. So I decide to build it. This is where problems begin.

Now, Alex has about $80k worth of metal in his back from a surgery. He‚Äôs the one most likely to use this chair. He just wanted to have one. Mary told me she bought this chair solely to use one of the support rods as an exercise bar and tells me where to find it.

So I get to building (and some yard work while I‚Äôm out there.) So about an hour into building it, Alex comes outside. He tells me Mary wants me to leave that support rod loose so she can take it off whenever to use it. I know her, she would never put it back and it doesn‚Äôt come off easy anyway. 

So I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs really dumb.‚Äù And I go inside and tell her I‚Äôm not building it half ass and risk someone getting hurt. Alex‚Äôs spine isn‚Äôt something I want to take a shock from a fall or any guests that might use it. If mom used it and fell, she‚Äôd likely die. 
So Mary goes ‚ÄòWell, if someone gets hurt, it‚Äôll be her fault and she‚Äôll own up to it.‚Äô 

I‚Äôm like, fault isn‚Äôt the issue. Someone getting hurt, is. She refuses to buy an actual exercise bar.

So I go back out and kind of stare blankly at the swing, trying to figure out some way to make this work. Matt gets home, sees I‚Äôm stressed and asks what‚Äôs wrong. I tell him what‚Äôs up, and he‚Äôs like ‚ÄúFuck no, I‚Äôll throw it out.‚Äù. He says he pays the bills, his rules. And I‚Äôm not a fan of that. It‚Äôll just immediately put everyone at each other throats again. He will not let it be used. I feel like a bitch, I just wanted to help and got stuck between two people who will not make concessions. 

My options were basically 
1: Someone might get hurt
2: Everyone gets pissed at each other again.

So I decide to say there‚Äôs missing parts. It cannot be built. 

Worth noting, Mary gave one of my mom‚Äôs chairs away. Figuring she‚Äôll be dead soon and it doesn‚Äôt matter. (Didn‚Äôt find out about that till later.)

27,1f3huhl,AITA for deciding to meet my friends even though my Gf doesn't want me to?,"

I (25M) have been in a relationship with my Gf(22F) for 3 years now. The last year of that has been a long distance relationship, I had to move away for higher education.
Initially we'd meet every month for 2-3 days but the last 4 months have been extremely hectic for both of us and we weren't able to meet at all. We still talk on call and video chat for at least 1-2 hours everyday but no physical contact. 

Earlier this month my semester got over and I had around a month free so I immediately went to see her and have been living with her at her apartment for the last 15 days. This is the first time I've stayed at her place as we'd usually stay at a hotel and she's becoming extremely controlling and rude about her house rules. For example I spilled coffee on a rug yesterday and as I was scrambling to find a rag to clean it up, she started screaming at me to clean it up immediately and how careless I was. 
Today my old friends started planning a meetup in our old hometown and I thought I'd go for it and told my gf about it. She became extremely upset, got cold and distant with me and told me to do whatever I wanted to in a really passive aggressive way. She keeps saying I don't prioritise her and wants me to stay at her place for the entire month. 
Another big issue I'm facing at her place is the fact that I can't leave the apartment. Her apartment complex is strict regarding visitors so she's basically had to sneak me inside and I've gone outside her apartment twice since I've come here. I've tried proposing that I live with a friend for a few days but she wants me to stay at her place. 

I've been feeling extremely cooped up and restless and when my friends (who I'd also been looking forward to meet) started planning meetup I thought it would be fine to go meet them for 2-3 days.

29,1f3hq25,AITA for confronting my friend for publishing a fake story involving me doing drugs at a nightclub with a rock star?,"I (47M) have a good friend from high school. I‚Äôll call her Jessica.

She‚Äôs involved in an inheritance scam, believing she‚Äôs about to receive billions of dollars in foreign real estate from a long-lost relative. She‚Äôs writing a book about her life. She asked people if she could use their first names, and everyone I know of said no.

But people sent me screenshots of an excerpt she posted on Facebook for our nearly 100 mutual friends to see. It‚Äôs an old, ridiculous story that includes me and two others who also said no to using their names. Most troubling, some of the story is fake, especially the part about us doing drugs.

**Her Story (Paraphrased):**

*In early 2001, we went to a nightclub (true) and met a rock star (partially true). We each took an ecstasy tablet (false). We had drinks (true). The lights dimmed (false), a hit song played (false), the crowd cheered (false), and the band entered (true). They went to a VIP area overlooking where we were dancing (true). We were really excited (true) and did more ecstasy (false). She called out to the rock star, and he looked (true). He came over and refused drinks we offered (partially true) and talked to us (false). Some of the band did as well (true).*

In reality, we didn‚Äôt talk to him, nor did we do ecstasy. It was a workday. They were drinking. The band snuck in discreetly. The rock star didn‚Äôt come over. Jessica‚Äôs boyfriend was so drunk we barely got him back to the car.

For context, we had done ecstasy before, but this was not one of those times. I‚Äôm not proud of it, but I‚Äôve moved on, and I thought she had as well. Our lives are very different now. I have my own online business and manage websites under my name. I could lose business. (She‚Äôs quitting her job, but some of us still have to work for a living.)

I messaged another person named in the story, and she was also concerned about her career. She contacted Jessica, who said she would change the names just before publication and had already removed the post at her (now ex) boyfriend‚Äôs request. There were no apologizes or promises.

I then contacted Jessica directly myself and asked her not to use my name. She treated it as a joke and said we were being paranoid. She insisted she wouldn‚Äôt use our real first names, but I pointed out that she already had. She said she can. It went in circles.  

The gaslighting took a turn when she admitted she didn‚Äôt care about our opinions anymore and could write whatever she wanted with our first names, even if it made us look bad. She also rubbed it in my face that she could say worse things, but won't, so stop complaining. That‚Äôs when I lost it, and we got into an argument. 

I could be the asshole because, as she says, I started this argument over nothing.

In reality, we didn‚Äôt talk to him, nor did we do ecstasy. It was a workday. They were drinking. The band snuck in discreetly. The rock star didn‚Äôt come over. Jessica‚Äôs boyfriend was so drunk we barely got him back to the car.

For context, we had done ecstasy before, but this was not one of those times. I‚Äôm not proud of it, but I‚Äôve moved on, and I thought she had as well. Our lives are very different now. I have my own online business and manage websites under my name. I could lose business. (She‚Äôs quitting her job, but some of us still have to work for a living.)

I messaged another person named in the story, and she was also concerned about her career. She contacted Jessica, who said she would change the names just before publication and had already removed the post at her (now ex) boyfriend‚Äôs request. There were no apologizes or promises.

I then contacted Jessica directly myself and asked her not to use my name. She treated it as a joke and said we were being paranoid. She insisted she wouldn‚Äôt use our real first names, but I pointed out that she already had. She said she can. It went in circles.  

The gaslighting took a turn when she admitted she didn‚Äôt care about our opinions anymore and could write whatever she wanted with our first names, even if it made us look bad. She also rubbed it in my face that she could say worse things, but won't, so stop complaining. That‚Äôs when I lost it, and we got into an argument. 

I could be the asshole because, as she says, I started this argument over nothing.

31,1f3hh14,AITA for agreeing with my dad's decision to go on holiday with my wealthy stepsister over my bio sister?,"I (25F) have two bio siblings and two step sisters. My sister (27F) and my step sister Amelia (27F) used to be very close in their early teens but then me and my sister stopped seeing our dad so much in our mid-late teens so we drifted to the point where we only speak to each other at family events now.

My sister got married 3 years ago and our dad wasn't able to contribute as much as she hoped so she had to settle for a small wedding which wasn't exactly her dream wedding. Part of the reason why he couldn't contribute as much is because he and my stepmother gave Amelia a ¬£15000 loan so she could get a master's degree. In our culture the dad pays for the wedding and our dad knew my sister was looking to get married so he shouldn't have given Amelia such a huge loan when she had other options.

That was the start of my sister's dislike for Amelia but things have gotten worse since Amelia's engagement and wedding last year. Amelia's in-law's are *wealthy* and her father-in-law decided to give Amelia a blank cheque for her wedding since her dad isn't in the picture. Amelia and my sister have always had similar tastes so she pretty much had my sister's *dream* wedding which has caused my sister to resent her even more.

So that brings me on to the current issue. My sister and Amelia both invited my dad on holiday this summer and he chose to spend it with Amelia and her in-laws. My sister is understandably hurt and angry over this but she won't stop going on and on about it. I think the reason my dad chose to spend it with Amelia is pretty simple - it was a free holiday and he doesn't have much disposable income at the moment. On top of that Amelia is pregnant so my stepmother would've pushed to spend it with her regardless.

Yesterday my sister brought it up again for the thousandth time so I told her frankly that I also would've chosen to go on holiday with Amelia if it was an option. To be frank, her in-laws have more money then we'll ever earn in our lifetime and it would be an experience to go on holiday with people with so much money. I get it sucks for my sister because she has this rivalry with Amelia but I don't see her turning down a free holiday. My brother agreed with me which I think contributed to how upset my sister is with me now because she doesn't like that my brother sees our stepsisters the same way he sees us, his bio sisters.

I (25f) met a couple, Beth (26f) and Jake (39m) through a mutual friend. They decided to introduce us because we both had puppies the same age. I was someone that grew up with dogs and have bred and trained working dogs in the past as well as doing some behavioural work with local dogs for friends. This was the couples first dog together. They were very impressed with how I trained my puppy and how well she was doing with me that we became fast friends. After a while they got a second dog, and I moved in with them to finish my studies. I did most of the training with the second dog, and she was the better behaved of their two.

Telling me I was an irresponsible dog owner and that I was abusing my dog (which to clarify I would never ever do. My dog and I have a respectful relationship based on trust). I ended up having to move out because of how horribly she was treating me. I also noticed how little work she put towards the dogs while I was there. It was always myself of Jake that was walking them, feeding them or training them. She just sat on her sofa and gave them affection once their needs had been taken care of. Since she was also a student, Jake was taking on the financial burden of their dogs. After a few months we became tentative friends again, and had a litter of puppies with my guidance.

He did something stupid and had another litter from the oldest dog without telling Beth or me(she had excellent breeding and health, and he wanted another dog to keep the puppy company).

33,1f3h02r,AITA for telling my mom she makes things more difficult for me and I wish she'd stay out of some things?,"My family is maybe complicated. Some people get kinda confused. So let me explain that first.

My mom had me (17f) and my two older brothers (23m, 25m) with dad #1. Dad #1 died when mom was pregnant with me. So I have no memories of him and I never met him. But I know he's biologically my dad and I have always been sad I didn't get to have a life with him in it.

My mom remarried when I was 3 to dad #2. He's dad to me but I also call my late dad my dad. My brother's don't call him dad or even stepdad. My parents have my three younger siblings together (13f, 11m, 10m).

My relationship with my older brothers is more like that of half siblings but not always. While my relationship with my younger siblings is closer. My older brothers don't really have a relationship with my younger siblings. They have no relationship with dad #2.

My mom likes to call all of us dad #2's kids. It pisses my older brothers off. My older brothers and mom fought a lot when they still lived at home. They didn't really approve of mom remarrying, but I think it's more to do with mom not keeping dad #1's memory alive. She'd get really weird if my older brothers told me about him. I'd hear her and them fight about it. Dad #2 would try to reach out to my older brothers but they had a solid wall between them and him and they interacted with him as little as possible. It was always awkward if he the only adult at home because they would keep to themselves.

It always made me sad that my older brothers were distant. But I also know they felt like dad was replaced so hearing me call dad #2 might have made it hard for them to be around me.

I was talking to my brothers more for the last few months and they were reaching out more. We even talked about dad a bit more. And they brought me to his special place. My first time ever being there. After I got back mom asked where we'd been and I told her. She called it a sibling day and called my oldest brother and asked why all of us weren't included. He said we'd gone to talk about and remember dad. She told him that was something they should have asked for permission to do with me, then she told them it's like they only give a crap about me when I acknowledge dad and she told them we're all their siblings regardless of dad. My brothers told me after they wouldn't do it again until I'm away from my parents house because they're not dealing with that crap.

I asked mom if we could talk and I told her that when she says things like that, when she gets weird about the boys talking about our dad, she makes things more difficult for me. I also told her she's wrong about them only talking to me when it's about dad but she only hears talk of dad and gets weird. I told her I get she wants them to give our younger siblings the same chance they give me sometimes but I wish she would stay out of this because we're trying to figure stuff out and she gets in the way. Mom accused me of taking their side and abandoning my younger siblings.

35,1f3gewm,WIBTA if I don‚Äôt invite one of my fianc√©‚Äôs cousins to our wedding?,"My fianc√© and I (M & F 27) are planning a medium-small wedding for summer 2025, probably about 80 guests. Our venue and budget could accommodate more, so this is not about trying to keep the size small. 

Originally, we‚Äôd planned to invite all of our cousins and their children. However, this summer at my fianc√©‚Äôs dad‚Äôs family‚Äôs annual camping trip, my fianc√©‚Äôs oldest cousin (we‚Äôll call him Greg, 40M acted in a way that makes me want to exclude him. I wasn‚Äôt on this trip because it coincided with an unmissable work opportunity, but multiple other cousins have verified what my fiance says happened. 

Greg lives near where they camp. The family always divides up the various logistical tasks for camping, and Greg is always in charge of picking up the food they purchased for the week and bringing it to the campsite. My fianc√© and his brother are responsible for organizing and funding the whole event. This year, Greg was hanging around the camp smoking weed and drinking, and my fiance asked him when he was going to get the food. Greg said he‚Äôd do it later, and my fiance pointed out that the store closed in 45 minutes, and was 30 minutes away, so that wouldn‚Äôt work. 

Greg lost it. He screamed at my fiance for blaming Greg for forgetting the food and literally said ‚Äúfuck you, you‚Äôre not  in charge.‚Äù Greg stormed off into the woods. Greg‚Äôs mom is ended up going to get the food. Later, Greg texted my fianc√© ‚Äúfuck you for telling my mom I wasn‚Äôt going to get the food. I was going to get it. I‚Äôm not incompetent.‚Äù Greg‚Äôs mom was present when Greg had his initial outburst and stormed off, so no one told her anything. Later, we learned Greg was tripping on acid during this episode. He has not apologized but is acting like nothing happened. 

I don‚Äôt want to invite him. IMO, someone who speaks that way to my future husband has no place at my table. My parents are paying for the wedding, so I get to make this decision. My fiance supports it, but he‚Äôs worried that Greg‚Äôs mom would be pissed at me, my fiance, and my fianc√©‚Äôs dad (her brother) for excluding her only child from the wedding. Since every other cousin would be invited, it would be clear that we were singling out Greg. I think it‚Äôs justified, but I know it could appear rude, and could ruffle feathers. WIBTA?

Edit to answer some questions: 

1. I initially asked my fianc√© to decide, and he said that he doesn‚Äôt want Greg there but understands that the social fallout will likely land on me since I am planning the wedding. HE WANTS ME TO MAKE THE FINAL CALL. 

2. Greg has a history of being unreliable. He‚Äôs recently gotten really into recreational drugs. This behavior is as escalation of a pattern that has existed in the past. 

3. Fianc√© texted Greg one time to ask if he wanted to talk and got no response. 

4. If Greg apologized we agree that we‚Äôd invite him.  ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-28,"WIBTA if I don‚Äôt invite one of my fianc√©‚Äôs cousins to our wedding?

I don‚Äôt want to invite him. IMO, someone who speaks that way to my future husband has no place at my table. My parents are paying for the wedding, so I get to make this decision. My fiance supports it, but he‚Äôs worried that Greg‚Äôs mom would be pissed at me, my fiance, and my fianc√©‚Äôs dad (her brother) for excluding her only child from the wedding. Since every other cousin would be invited, it would be clear that we were singling out Greg. I think it‚Äôs justified, but I know it could appear rude, and could ruffle feathers. WIBTA?

Edit to answer some questions: 

1. I initially asked my fianc√© to decide, and he said that he doesn‚Äôt want Greg there but understands that the social fallout will likely land on me since I am planning the wedding. HE WANTS ME TO MAKE THE FINAL CALL. 

2. Greg has a history of being unreliable. He‚Äôs recently gotten really into recreational drugs. This behavior is as escalation of a pattern that has existed in the past. 

3. Fianc√© texted Greg one time to ask if he wanted to talk and got no response. 

4. If Greg apologized we agree that we‚Äôd invite him.  ",0.0,0.1074473485350608,0,1
36,1f3fm29,AITA for helping to separate a baby from his dad? ,"**A bit of necessary backstory**: when I was younger, my parents participated in an initiative whereby young people from northern Ukraine came to stay with us in the countryside for some of the summer. We hosted a few different kids but in particular Ivan and Ana were around the same age as my sister and I and we all really got along. So they visited repeatedly and eventually we would visit them in return and be hosted by their family, to the point that me and my sister were practically fluent in Russian as kids. 

We drifted a bit and lost touch later in life, maybe would catch up every year, followed each other on Instagram and did Snapchat streaks when those were popular, etc, so weren't close but weren't strangers. 

 However, after the war started, my parents were straight away in touch with theirs to ask if they could help. Thankfully their mother had relatives in Poland she could go to, although she and my mother still exchange texts every few months about how things are going. Ivan had to stay, due to his age, and Ana declined the offer, which I also made. 

**The current situation**:

Last week, Ivan contacted me to ask if I would agree to sponsor Ana and help her get out. It seems that she is in an extremely abusive situation, to the point that her husband would not let her leave even when their town was directly hit by strikes and neighbours died. They have just had a son about three months ago and Ana is now desperate to leave her husband before anything happens to the baby, as apparently things have worsened again in their area. 

My boyfriend, John, is vehemently opposed to the idea. For clarity, we don't live together - I live with my cousin near London, who has said she would have no issues with converting our at-home office into a bedroom for Ana and her baby, as we both are back working full time in the office since the pan demic ended. 

However, John argues that I am helping to separate a baby from his father without anyone's word but Ivan's that there is an abusive situation (Ivan suggested that it is difficult for Ana to communicate with others at the moment given her husband's paranoia). John is still convinced that I might basically be assisting in abduction. 

He also thinks they are exploiting our goodwill, given that Ana declined the offer when the war started and now wants to come over with a baby, which means she won't be expected to work (?). He also knows people who sponsored Ukrainians who have gone back home during the war, so has started to believe that they are ""exaggerating"" how bad things are.

Some of our friends, mostly male, have really backed John in his concerns. However, my sister (who knows Ivan and Ana), my cousin (who I live with) and my female best friend have all agreed that I am doing the right thing and have advised me to reconsider my relationship with John.

AITA for refusing to tattoo my BFF?
I've never made an AITA post before and English isn't my first language so bear with me.

I (23f) refused to tattoo my (23f) BFF. We've known each other since middle school. She used to like tattoos but not on her. I on the other hand absolutely loved them and was already set on having a lot of tattoos. However as the year passed, she grew a bit more interested and said she might do a small one but only when she's much older. 

However a few days ago when we met up she asked me to book her an appointment because she decided to get one, specifically for me. I refuse because while I don't make glaring mistakes, I'm still new at the profession and not the best at it. She insisted saying she didn't care if it was shit she just wanted to share this with me. 

However I was very uncomfortable with the idea of getting it wrong. She insisted it would be more meaningful if I did it. I shut her down.

I understand her desire for a tattoo from someone she trusts, but I simply don't think I'm qualified to do it. I'm still learning and I don't want to risk messing up her skin. I've seen other artists' work and I know I'm not on that level yet. I suggested she go to a more experienced tattoo artist instead or wait a few years for me to get better. She was disappointed and told me goodbye and left.

I'm not sure if I made the right decision. I still feel a bit guilty about refusing, but I don't want to regret giving her a tattoo that I'm not proud of. I hope she understands and finds a great artist to give her the tattoo she wants.

We haven't talked about it or anything else since. She doesn't answer my texts or phone calls and I'm worried that she's still very mad at me. I don't know if I should apologize or just let things be.


EDIT: I accidentally left a part out when copying it from my notes (I might not post on aita but I've posted on other subs before on my main and there have been far too many times I accidentally deleted instead of posting)

38,1f3e9of,WIBTA if I don't invite my younger sister to college parties?,"My sister ""Leah"" (16F) and I (18F) grew up very close since we are only two years apart and I consider her one of my best friends. When we were younger she was shy and had trouble making friends, so she ended up hanging out with me and my friend group a lot. In high school whenever I went to parties she would often tag along. There were never any issues, especially since my friend group was relatively tame (i.e. no alcohol, drugs, sex, etc.) and I didn't feel like I had to go out of my way to look out for her.

This year I am starting college and Leah is going to be a junior in high school. I am still living at home and commuting to school. I have already started attending some orientation events and was invited to a few parties. I have noticed that the vibe of these parties is quite different from what I and Leah are used to. For example, there was drinking, weed, and some of the guys were very flirtatious / sexually forward. 

Leah has asked if she can tag along to some of these parties and got upset when I told her that the parties I'm going to now aren't appropriate for her age. She said that I was being condescending and overprotective. However, I think there is a difference between the high school parties we went to where we played video games and ate chips with people we had known all our lives versus the college environment where people are testing and pushing various boundaries. AITA? 

Her point of view is that we have always been 2 years apart, so it doesn't make sense that I am now sudddenly saying she is ""too young"" to be in the same social circle as me.

She asked our supervisor if she can leave at 1 but our supervisor said that it's not a good day to ask for early off, as they are busy. 

Then my sister proceeded to tell the supervisor that I can take her shift without asking me if I can/want to first. I have my own meetings tomorrow and plans but apparently ""I can cancel those"". 

Then my mom called me and tried to guilt trip me into taking my sister's shift, because my sister has anxiety and is worried about whatever she has to have checked. And at the end of the conversation my mom told me ""have a good life"" and I'm being called selfish and stuff like that. 

I think there was other solutions to her problem rather than making that decision for me without my approval. If it's an emergency, she can go to the ER. She didn't even try to call the clinic to see if she can get an appointment after 2pm. Let me know what you guys think. AITA?

41,1f3d6y0,AITA- Mom wants me to literally ask permission to have people over-which I thought I did? ,"Aplogies- I'm on mobile

Hokay. So for context, I (24enby) lived away from home for 5 years with my partner. They cheated on me and it led to me moving back in with my mom and her husband. When I lived with my ex, we lived in their childhood home with their parents. When we wanted to have people over it was a let them know kind of situation. If it didn't work, their parents would have a conversation with us about it, you know, cuz we're adults. 

So anyway, last night my mom comes into my room and tells me I need to ask to have people over, as I just had someone over this weekend while they were away. I was confused by this because I notified her many times that I would like to have someone over. We had full blown conversations about plans I was making for when my friend is here, and what we want to get up to, etc. So I was very confused.

She said I have to literally ask if it's okay. And I was like, no? I'm not going to be treated  like a child. I explained to her that me informing her I'd like to have someone over is the opportunity for her to say no that doesn't work or ask questions. She didn't like that and said I'm being childish. Which I find hilarious because she's asking me to act like a child by asking my mommy if my 24yo ass can have a sleepover. 

I tried setting the boundary and explaining why that bothers me and how I communicate, and she's just stuck on her point. She's doubling down on it. Like, what's next? Asking permission to go to someone's house? Fuck that noise. 

So now she's sending me messages and posts from extreme control freak parents who's children don't talk to them anymore to prove her point. This feels like it's about control. As for rent and their house their rules, If I paid rent, this wouldn't change. Also she just drained my entire RESP fund to buy her new car so now I have no money left going into my third year of school. If she wanted rent she shouldn't have taken the only money I had that was saved up for me. 

I want to make it VERY clear that I agree you should notify people you live with that you want to have people over, etc. But her literally wanting me to ask like I'm a teenager again isn't going to fly with me. I'm trying to communicate with her adult to adult, not child to adult. 

She's acting like I brought a friend over without saying a word to her about it and expected her to be okay with that. This wasn't the case at all, and I would never disrespect someone like that. 

Also for context, all my friends who live at home (which is all of them lol) have the telling parents agreement. I think there's a slight cultural difference maybe as we are Polish immigrants.

I wasn't particularly popular, but I made one of the representative positions and was fine with it. Once I'd joined, I then learned that our student council members were responsible for handling the reunions for forever. 

At 17, that seemed fine - I had way more things to worry about than throwing a party every 10 years or so. Then that year turned into the worst bullying hell of my life. Rumors were spread by an ex that (amongst other things) I got my good grades by sleeping with teachers, that I was riddled with STIs, and that I was telling cruel lies about my friends behind their backs. There were worse things that feel too triggering to write out. His friends even got teachers to believe some of it, including the guidance councilor who I went to for help. It was a small school, so everyone knew everything pretty quickly, and my friends didn't stand up for me. I had only moved to town my junior year, and the rest of them had been going to the same schools for forever, so I guess I get it, but all in all I was incredibly glad to graduate and put those people behind me. It took a LOT of therapy, but I'm finally gaining control of the mental illnesses that those years helped feed.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôve been super supportive and have been there for her the whole time to allow her to vent ect. 

But ‚Ä¶ she is quite self-centred and every must ALWAYS be about her. So I‚Äôm finding it hard to stick with her while she is honesty a pain in the ass. 

Am I the asshole for slightly distancing myself from her as she makes my mood 10x worse when i spend time with her. 

I understand we need to stick with friends through times like this but Jesus Christ I‚Äôm getting depressed listening to her (when in reality her life is much much better than mine) - not that that‚Äôs not a reason to be depressed but it‚Äôs getting harder to deal with!!!!!

Anyone dealt with this before.!?

44,1f3ckbp,AITA for refusing to allow my brother to drive with us to the family vacation?,"**Context:** My partner (26) and I (22) both have autism, and my 15-year-old brother has severe ADHD. My brother is also immature, careless, and deep in puberty. He's known for being a handful‚Äîconstantly late, and destructive with his belongings and others'. For instance, he's broken multiple phones and laptops my mom bought him.

This Friday, we're planning a family trip across the country. My partner and I were looking forward to a peaceful road trip alone, having planned our drive and stops in advance. However, today my mom found out that my partner would be driving, and decided to have my brother ride with us, saying, ""Since you're driving anyway, he can come with you."" She and her boyfriend are driving separately in a two-seater van due to the amount of stuff they need to bring.

We really don't want to babysit an unruly 15-year-old for four hours, especially since we weren‚Äôt asked nicely, just told he would be with us. Normally, my mom and her boyfriend drive in two cars, so we assumed that would happen again. This year, though, with my partner joining us, they saw an opportunity to shift responsibility. While we understand their reasoning and offered to take him if absolutely necessary, we‚Äôre not happy about the situation.

When I talked to my mom, she didn‚Äôt have convincing arguments. Her points were:

* **Driving separately is expensive:** We offered to cover the extra gas since we‚Äôre ‚Äúcausing the inconvenience‚Äù in her eyes, but she declined.
* **He can‚Äôt drive with our sister:** Because they‚Äôll arrive later. However, we‚Äôre not planning to arrive on time either, as we‚Äôre taking a more relaxed trip. My partner, who‚Äôs an anxious driver, prefers not to drive in a convoy and likes to rely on her satnav, especially due to her autism.
* **Things could go wrong if he‚Äôs late:** But she couldn‚Äôt specify what.

Our conclusion: We could take him if necessary, but reluctantly. We have a lot to bring and aren't sure everything will fit. Plus, if he‚Äôs coming with us, he‚Äôll need to follow our schedule, meaning we likely won‚Äôt arrive on time.

Now my mom is upset and said she‚Äôll ask my sister after all, despite never asking us first. We feel we offered a reasonable compromise, but she‚Äôs implying that ‚Äúeveryone has to make sacrifices‚Äù while essentially making my brother our responsibility.

45,1f3chpr,AITAH for making a big deal out of something my friend did and expect an apology in order to move forward?,"Some context first, I (22F) have been an environmental volunteer for almost 2 years. I enjoy doing this monthly community group because it gives me some time outdoors.  Plus, I get to meet people who also love plants and landscaping

About 7 months ago I met someone I viewed as one of my dearest friends. For anonymity I will call her Jess. Outside this group we have caught up twelve-ish times just for a coffee or lunch and four times at eachother‚Äôs places

I haven‚Äôt had any problems with Jess until last week. I am really upset because our friendship was going so well and I can‚Äôt work out where she got the idea to do this or if I am overreacting

Jess is energetic and outgoing. Me on the other hand.. not so much. I felt comfortable being around her though, it just worked. One of Jess‚Äô friends, who she has spoken of many times to me, works with her and that‚Äôs how they met. I had never met the woman before and I feel like this is important info. I‚Äôll give her a name to make this easier- Olivia. 

So what happened? 
I invited Jess over to my place just for a coffee and chat. Now I do still live with my parents and so does she but this particular time I chose, everyone was out elsewhere in my place. She has been to mine twice before

She arrives on time, two minutes early in fact and she knocks on the door. I make my way to the front door and see two figures. At first I had no idea what Jess was up to 

I couldn‚Äôt understand what I was seeing. Or hearing. ‚ÄúHi Jess‚Äù I said and maintaining this attempt at a polite smile, I followed it with ‚ÄúHey Olivia.‚Äù I guess I wasnt hiding my confusion that well because Jess said ‚ÄúI thought I‚Äôd get you two to meet finally since you always hear about eachother‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt know if this was the right or wrong thing to do but I felt like I couldnt say anything about how uncomfortable I felt or angry I was that Jess had brought Olivia to my house when I never heard anything about it. So what did I do? I let them both in and I spoke about nothing too personal the whole time

I couldn‚Äôt be rude to Olivia and just reject her at my doorstep could I? 

I thought about it for a day until finally I opened up to Jess about why it upset me. I asked why she thought she could invite whoever she wanted without telling me and share my address without my permission. My PARENTS address. Idk anymore man but I feel like this is costing us our friendship. Jess has told me I am ‚Äúbeing a baby‚Äù about the situation, overreacting, that its something ‚Äúpeople just do.‚Äù I want to believe this but I haven‚Äôt heard of this as a common issue before.. ? 

Also Olivia knows I wasn‚Äôt happy about her surprise visit and I feel so betrayed that Jess just told her. Olivia probably thinks I am jealous over Jess but that‚Äôs not true. I haven‚Äôt spoken since and I expect an apology at least. The next group is soon btw

53,1f3bd71,WIBTA if I didn't visit partner's relatives,"SO my partner and I recently moved out and suddenly his relatives (especially his mom) want us to visit all the time. Whenever my partner goes to see them I stay at home. He asked why I didn't want to come with a few times but when I told him that I no longer have the patience to sit around and be ignored by people that look down on me and treat us poorly, he seemed to understand. We work 6 days a week so visits are always scheduled on a Sunday, which is my only off day to relax and do the household chores, and I really don't see the point in wasting my Sunday to entertain a bunch of people I don't even like.

The other day he had to go visit his mom and grandparents because they wanted to see his new car. I stayed home, and afterwards he mentioned that it was uncomfortable because everyone kept asking where I was and why I didn't come with. Now he seems upset that I don't want to come with for visits, and asked me to join him next time just to ""show face.""

For context: His mom expected him to pay 3x the market rate to rent his own bedroom when he turned 18, before he even had a job. When I moved in to share the room with him she expected an additional 3k from my side on top of the 6k ""rent"" he was already expected to pay. We had a 3/4 bed to share, and had to cover all our own groceries and expenses. The jobs we're working now only pay 6k a month, so his dad covered the ""rent"" for us. We still think it was just a plot to continue getting the 6k a month she originally received when his dad was paying child support, once he was no longer legally obligated to pay it. Then she would go on to lock the FOUR dogs in the house for 8-10 hours a day, and blame us when we got home for not cleaning up their poop and pee puddles everywhere. She also frequently took photos and videos of how disgusting the house was to show to his grandparents and blame us for the state it was in. When we tried explaining that we work till 6 and it's not OUR dogs, and she only works till 2 but will rather go out and party and wait for us to get home to open for the dogs instead of coming home to do it herself, his grandparents said we should be making more of an effort to help her. They also ignore me every time we visit them, asking me if I want coffee, and then only speaking to my partner for the rest of the visit. My partner's dad and I are the only people that have ever made an effort to help him, and they still act like they and their daughter are the ""can do no wrong"" type of people, but let his own mother allow him him sit in a house without food for days while he was a kid which in my eyes is plain abuse. His grandparents also stole money from his savings account, that he was hoping to buy a bike with, to pay for his mom's car repairs and never gave it back.

54,1f3b64x,"AITA for ""assuming"" I still had a job","\*throwaway\*

I (f25) have had a ""seasonal"" job since 2022. I can't say what the job is, but as far as I am aware, this is the only company that does what we do in the US.

We work mid-February to mid-July and then September to mid-December (hence ""seasonal""). We get August off because there is a convention overseas that my boss, ""Paul"" attends yearly (relevant). It's probably important to note my contract starts in August, not in February.

Our spring ""season"" ended this year on July 15th. The week after, I represented the company in a few meetings while Paul went overseas. I was the only employee out of the 15 to be asked to do this. I hadn't heard much from Paul this month, but this has been the norm during off-seasons so I did not overthink it.

On Saturday I went out to lunch with one of my coworkers, ""Jen"", and in conversation, she asked me what I thought about my assignment for the upcoming period. Confused, I told her I hadn't received anything about an assignment. She said she had gotten an email last Monday from Paul with her assignment for the season. We changed topics and continued our lunch.

When I got home, I checked both my work and personal email to see if I had missed something from Paul, but the last email I had from him was about payment for the meetings at the end of July. I decided to send him a quick email to see if he forgot to CC me in the email.

He took until yesterday at 10 pm to respond (mind you he is 5 hours ahead of me at the moment so this was at 3 am his time).

His message read:

""Hello OP,

There seems to be a misunderstanding on your end. You are no longer employed at XYZ Company.

Paul""

I freak out a bit, because literally what? As I said, I have no emails from him after the payment from the July meetings, and other than a few messages about the convention he was attending, we have not spoken since July.  He goes on vacation after the convention every year and will not answer messages (or log into Slack) during that time. We normally hear from him a week or two before the start of the season with assignments and then not again until the first day.

I called Jen right after he emailed, and told her the situation. I could tell she was a bit annoyed since it was 10:30 at night. After I explained what happened, she said ""well you know what happens when you assume"" and hung up.

This morning I had a text from Jen's husband (who has worked for the company for about 5 years) saying that I ""needed to stop being such so cocky because who assumes they still have a job when it is a seasonal position.""

I'm honestly just really dumbfounded right now. I don't even know how I am going to pay my rent next month because it's not like I can easily find a job in the field.

But AITA for assuming that I still had a job?

Note: We don't have an HR department since it is such a small company, and I plan to read my contract front to back today to see if this letting me go was even legal.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-28,"AITA for ""assuming"" I still had a job \*throwaway\*

We have one legal vehicle, which is the truck I inherited when my father passed away a few years ago. I also have another truck that does not run, it was also my father‚Äôs. 3 of my kiddos are under 5, my oldest is my sister whom I have custody of, she has a car, so she doesn‚Äôt partially count in this situation. The beginning of this summer, I put my son on a waitlist for preschool. Fast forward 2ish months. I get a phone call a week before school starts that a spot has opened up for my son. Great! Except I don‚Äôt have a vehicle. Now when my husband came into this relationship he did not even have a drivers license. So once he got that, he drove my grandmothers car, and then my truck. The intent was for him to get my other truck running (it‚Äôs old) but we both love it. He had a motorcycle that didn‚Äôt run, and he wanted to trade it on Facebook for a motor. Great- except nobody would take it. So my husband asked if I would be willing to part with my dad‚Äôs racing dirt bike. After about 2 weeks of him complaining and whining, I finally gave in. INSTEAD of trading for something to get the older truck running, he traded for a car. But hey, this car ran, and now I had my truck. This was awesome, I was sad to see my dirt bike go, but it was worth it to finally have freedom again. Maybe 2 weeks go by of him having this car, and he‚Äôs over it. So he trades for a 70‚Äôs square body. But hey- it runs. Until a day later when he pulled half of it apart to ‚Äúwork‚Äù on it. Now, I‚Äôm out of a vehicle again. I was really upset about this, but he was the one going to work, I was the one staying home. About a month went by before I got the call that my son had a spot in preschool. It is only half days- it costs $50 a week, and there‚Äôs no bus service. I told my husband I needed my truck back- he had a week to get his square body in running order and legal. So he spent a few days complaining, the next few days painting it? And then on Wednesday, my son started school and my husband took his square body to work. (It‚Äôs iffy and has no plates, it DOES have insurance) I had my truck back to get my son to and from school. The next day my husband called into work- and almost for fired for it. So he spent the next few days complaining, saying how everything is my fault, I‚Äôm taking the legal, running vehicle from him for my son to go a non-mandatory school that costs money. He said he‚Äôs the one making money, so he‚Äôs the one who should have the vehicle. Monday morning he made me get the 3 kids up at 5 am to drop him off at work, then I had to pick him up that afternoon. (His truck can make it to work fine, the biggest issue is it not having plates) I think that was his last ditch effort to get me to pull my son out of preschool, so he could have my truck back.

Except I don‚Äôt have a vehicle. Now when my husband came into this relationship he did not even have a drivers license. So once he got that, he drove my grandmothers car, and then my truck. The intent was for him to get my other truck running (it‚Äôs old) but we both love it. He had a motorcycle that didn‚Äôt run, and he wanted to trade it on Facebook for a motor. Great- except nobody would take it. So my husband asked if I would be willing to part with my dad‚Äôs racing dirt bike. After about 2 weeks of him complaining and whining, I finally gave in. INSTEAD of trading for something to get the older truck running, he traded for a car. But hey, this car ran, and now I had my truck. This was awesome, I was sad to see my dirt bike go, but it was worth it to finally have freedom again. Maybe 2 weeks go by of him having this car, and he‚Äôs over it. So he trades for a 70‚Äôs square body. But hey- it runs. Until a day later when he pulled half of it apart to ‚Äúwork‚Äù on it. Now, I‚Äôm out of a vehicle again. I was really upset about this, but he was the one going to work, I was the one staying home. About a month went by before I got the call that my son had a spot in preschool. It is only half days- it costs $50 a week, and there‚Äôs no bus service. I told my husband I needed my truck back- he had a week to get his square body in running order and legal. So he spent a few days complaining, the next few days painting it? And then on Wednesday, my son started school and my husband took his square body to work. (It‚Äôs iffy and has no plates, it DOES have insurance) I had my truck back to get my son to and from school. The next day my husband called into work- and almost for fired for it. So he spent the next few days complaining, saying how everything is my fault, I‚Äôm taking the legal, running vehicle from him for my son to go a non-mandatory school that costs money. He said he‚Äôs the one making money, so he‚Äôs the one who should have the vehicle. Monday morning he made me get the 3 kids up at 5 am to drop him off at work, then I had to pick him up that afternoon. (His truck can make it to work fine, the biggest issue is it not having plates) I think that was his last ditch effort to get me to pull my son out of preschool, so he could have my truck back. Tuesday, and today he drove his truck again. So, AITA? ",0.0,0.0417581498622894,0,1
60,1f3a2ip,AITA for not telling my SO of my plans to go to the gym. ,"Ok, this is going to be a long read. My (44f) SO of 10 years (55) and I had an argument earlier today and its not the first time this happens. Yesterday while at work my co-worker lets call her Ruby, invited me to join her at the gym before work since she just started working out. I suffer from Fibromyalgia and Hashimoto's and lately I have had no energy for absolutely anything. I am in constant pain. When my co-worker asked if I would join her I of course googled if it would help me with my constant aches and pain and it does. So I agreed.

My SO's job is more labor intensive so he goes to work at 5 am and is normally home by 1:30-2:00 pm, he goes to the gym Mon, Wed and Fri and it rotates every week and on those days he gets home about 4 pm, The issue is when I got home yesterday (I normally don't get home until 5:45pm) we hung out for less then an hour and he fell asleep. Knowing that I had told my co-worker I would join her for the gym I decided to take a sleep aid about 8:30 and fell asleep about 930ish (as he woke up). Knowing he was going to be up for a few hours at this point I went to bed in the other bedroom.

This morning I got up and got my bag ready and was looking everywhere for my Air pods or beats so I could listen to music while working out. I called him to see if he'd seen them and he was surprised I was calling him so early, I explained quickly why and then hung up. Finally found my Air pods so I headed out the door and out of the house. Once in my car I called him again like I normally do on my way to work and it became a thing. He immediately started questioning why I was going to the gym, I explained that Ruby had invited me and then all hell broke loose. He was upset that I never join him even though I'm still at work when he goes to the gym. We got into a shouting match over the gym! After arguing for a few minutes he brings up his insecurities (cheated on by his ex wife and ex gf), and this is where I might be the asshole, I told him that after 10 years his insecurities are his problem and not mine. I have not given him any reason to doubt or not trust me in the whole time we've been together. I told him I've been cheated on before and never used that as a crutch in how I behave with him.

It has been 10 years of this, not being able to do what I want, when I get home he wants me in the room with him and wants me to show him affection all the time even if he's not paying attention to me or else its an argument. I just don't see how AITAH.

I went home right before school started again to meet him and spend some time with everyone, which was nice. They recently texted me and asked if I could come to the baby‚Äôs baptism, which would be the week right before thanksgiving break, which would be midterms, and a lot of traveling within the span of two weeks.

My stepmom sent me the date and I said ‚Äúthis should work, but I will let you know once it gets closer‚Äù and that was it.

63,1f396tj,AITA. for going to my grandfather's funeral even when my father doesn't want me to?,"
 I (23F) don't really talk that much with my father (52M) because of his wife (45 i think). We have a long history of not liking  each other. 

I have basically been her (my fathers wife) confidant and her psychologist  since I was 13 years old. I have been listening non-stop about how my mother was a bad mother for asking for child support, how she was not with us (she was a single mom working to feed 4 children when my father was paying 400 euros a month for the four of us). I have heard her complain about my father in every possible way (even in sexual ways when I was 15/16), I have heard her say that we (the children) were the reason if they ever got divorced. The situation got so bad that I was failing school non-stop because all I was thinking about was the situation I had with her at my father's home, to the point that I have panic attacks because of it.

  
Around one year ago, we had a big argument (her and I), and I left my father's house and did not step foot in it (one time because of Christmas and my sister begged me). I don't really want to have anything to do with her, as in our last argument, she basically exited my brother and I from my father's home because I didn't want to listen to her talk bad once more  about my sister and my family. I simply told her that ""I don't care"", that I heard enough of her talking about every single thing that every single person in my family has done ""to her"".  She has a notebook, like a diary, where she puts everything that she has done for us, like staying one more night because of my grandmother's death, or piking us up from high school when my father was working. She also points out the wrongs that we did, like stepping up for my mother, going out late, or talking back when we were teenagers.

Well, in summary, my grandfather just died, and I need to go to another country to be able to assist to his funeral. As soon as I was told about the news, I called my father to ask how he was and that I wanted to go to the funeral. My father didn't really want to talk, but well, essentially, my sister told me that my father doesn't know what to do because her wife has told him that if I were to go to my grandfather's funeral, she wouldn't go. 

Essentially, she is putting my father in a place to choose between bringing her daughter or her wife to his father's funeral.  I'm really disappointed about this, not just because she is putting my father in this bad of a situation at a very low point in his life, but because my father said that this is his father's funeral and his wife's, suggesting that I should not go to my grandfather's funeral.

I don't really know what to do, I don't want to cause a family drama in this situation because it is not about whether we are good friends or not, but I think I have the right to go to my grandfather's funeral, whether she goes or not (because I don't care).

65,1f387bs,AITA for telling my friend she should dress up ?,"My friend and I, both 21F were invited to my best friend 22F birthday in her parent's house. It was just a small gathering with her friends and her boyfriend. Because we don't live in the same city, my friend and I ended up sleeping there, with my best friend and her boyfriend. Both of us have known my best friend for a really long time, and we were in the same swimming club, so we're comfortable with each other n*dity. I have to mention that it's summer and the weather was truly really hot. So that's for context. 

After the party, my best friend went to take a shower and left the bathroom wearing a top and und*rwear. Then my friend went to and also left the bathroom in her und*rwear. I went to her and told her that it's inappropriate, but she brushed me off. I thought that at least she was going to rush to the bedroom, but she stayed chatting with us. I saw my best friend's boyfriend being uncomfortable, so I joked saying that she should put her shorts back on because as the only girl wearing pants I was starting to feel self-conscious. She then stared at me and told me that I really needed to mind my own business and that I could leave if I was such a prude. 

My best friend and her boyfriend left to bring us pillows, so I told my friend again that I believed that it's very inappropriate for her to be in that outfit in front of someone else's boyfriend, but she again told me that if it's bothering my best friend, she should tell her, and that it's not my business. Among the 4 of us, my best friend is the only one who was a bit drunk so she's not entirely conscious of what was going on, so I felt like it's an excuse, and we ended up arguing. 

This morning, she went to complain to my best friend and told her that I was really mean, and made her feel self-conscious about her body. My best friend told me that I shouldn't have argued with her and that it's not that deep, and she asked me to apologize. I told her that I loved her and I wanted to make her happy, but that I felt like it was really inappropriate of my friend and that I was not going to apologize and make her believe that her behavior is okay. Since then, both of them have given me the cold shoulder. 

I know that I'm a bit more old-fashioned than my friends sometimes, but I do believe that I'm not in the wrong here... what's your opinion ?

‚ú®Ô∏è‚ú®Ô∏è

*Update :*

*I don't think it's shameful to be wrong so after reading your comments I decided to apologize to my friend. I called her and told her I was sorry for making her uncomfortable, that I really didn't wanted to be mean and that I realised that it's true that it wasn't my business as it didn't bother me personnaly but I was bothered FOR my best friend and her boyfriend. She told me that everything was okay between us and she joked saying that she wouldn't do that in front of my boyfriend then, so we're good !*

*I also called my best friend to apologize for bringing the mood down and she also told me that we were completely fine so that's great too !*

*After we left, her boyfriend told her that he felt that my friend was flirting with him and she asked my opinion since she was drunk. She actually didn't gave me the cold shoulder, she was just embarrassed to tell me that after telling me that I overreacted. I didn't see anything like that (except for the underwear part, but I think she was just hot, not flirting). Plus I really believe she's not that kind of person. I told her that, and her boyfriend understood so everything is settled üòÅ I realized that I shouldn't have put my nose into it because they are entirely able to say what's bothering them or not and I don't needed to be their white knight üòÖ*

*I wouldn't have realised that it was actually more of a me-issue in that situation without you, so I want to tell you that I used your advices ! And thank you ! üòä*

I went to her and told her that it's inappropriate, but she brushed me off. I thought that at least she was going to rush to the bedroom, but she stayed chatting with us. I saw my best friend's boyfriend being uncomfortable, so I joked saying that she should put her shorts back on because as the only girl wearing pants I was starting to feel self-conscious. She then stared at me and told me that I really needed to mind my own business and that I could leave if I was such a prude. 

My best friend and her boyfriend left to bring us pillows, so I told my friend again that I believed that it's very inappropriate for her to be in that outfit in front of someone else's boyfriend, but she again told me that if it's bothering my best friend, she should tell her, and that it's not my business. Among the 4 of us, my best friend is the only one who was a bit drunk so she's not entirely conscious of what was going on, so I felt like it's an excuse, and we ended up arguing. 

This morning, she went to complain to my best friend and told her that I was really mean, and made her feel self-conscious about her body. My best friend told me that I shouldn't have argued with her and that it's not that deep, and she asked me to apologize. I told her that I loved her and I wanted to make her happy, but that I felt like it was really inappropriate of my friend and that I was not going to apologize and make her believe that her behavior is okay. Since then, both of them have given me the cold shoulder. 

I know that I'm a bit more old-fashioned than my friends sometimes, but I do believe that I'm not in the wrong here... what's your opinion ?

‚ú®Ô∏è‚ú®Ô∏è

*Update :*

*I don't think it's shameful to be wrong so after reading your comments I decided to apologize to my friend. I called her and told her I was sorry for making her uncomfortable, that I really didn't wanted to be mean and that I realised that it's true that it wasn't my business as it didn't bother me personnaly but I was bothered FOR my best friend and her boyfriend. She told me that everything was okay between us and she joked saying that she wouldn't do that in front of my boyfriend then, so we're good !*

*I also called my best friend to apologize for bringing the mood down and she also told me that we were completely fine so that's great too !*

*After we left, her boyfriend told her that he felt that my friend was flirting with him and she asked my opinion since she was drunk. She actually didn't gave me the cold shoulder, she was just embarrassed to tell me that after telling me that I overreacted. I didn't see anything like that (except for the underwear part, but I think she was just hot, not flirting). Plus I really believe she's not that kind of person. I told her that, and her boyfriend understood so everything is settled üòÅ I realized that I shouldn't have put my nose into it because they are entirely able to say what's bothering them or not and I don't needed to be their white knight üòÖ*

*I wouldn't have realised that it was actually more of a me-issue in that situation without you, so I want to tell you that I used your advices ! And thank you ! üòä*

I was in the living room but I had no issue with it. I liked my little corner, and I had a beautiful view of nyc at my window. 

A few days into being there a girl assigned to into the bedroom asked me if we could switch places so she could be with her friend that was going to move in. I said yes because I didn‚Äôt want to get in the way of her and her friend, and because I didn‚Äôt want to risk starting any problems when we have a whole year living with each other. 

But now I‚Äôm deeply regretting that decision. 
1. I feel like a prisoner in the bedroom.
2. My roommate make SO much noise. Not in the sense that she talks loud or anything, she‚Äôs very quiet in that regard. But she makes so noise noise even when moving the tiniest item. She makes the bed creek every 5 seconds. No exaggeration, and it‚Äôs not only at night. It‚Äôs literally all day. I‚Äôm a light sleeper and all of her noise is affecting my sleep. 

Ps‚Äî not fat shaming her. I‚Äôm literally bigger than her.

Anyway, I want to switch back. I hate it. I know this post is making it seem like it‚Äôs only because of the roommate, but it‚Äôs not. I just hate everything about the spot. I liked having the open space in the living room. I genuinely feel like I have to be locked in the bedroom every time I‚Äôm in the apartment. 

Am I the asshole if I ask to switch back?

67,1f37tta,AITA for calling my brother in law an arrogant snob and arsehole for not respecting my boyfriend and not wanting to pay him for his work?,"I (32f) have been with my boyfriend (34m) for almost 7 years now. My sister (34f) got married about a year ago to her longterm boyfriend (36m).

Shortly after my sister got married she became pregnant with my little nephew. About 3 months after he was born, BIL asked my boyfriend (who is a mechanic) to check his car. He happily agreed, ordered new parts and it took about 3 hours to do the whole service and renew everything necessary. All went fine, they had fun chatting a bit and we agreed to meet for coffee the sunday afterwards.

On saturday my sister called me to ask how much they owe to my boyfriend for the work. I told her I would ask and got back to them with a text saying that the total would be 150 EURO. For comparison, if BIL would have went to a car shop he would have paid around 900 EURO.

A few minutes later my sister calls me, telling me that this amount is ridiculous and that Klaus is fuming as he expected not to pay anything (but the parts). I'm super confused and tell her that the guys should talk directly to each other to figure this out.

So we hang up and me and my boyfriend have time to get super pissed about their behaviour. For the greater context you need to know that my BIL always made clear that he doesn't like my boyfriend. Saying mean things about this blue collar clothes, family, hair style, music taste, etc.. My sister always made sure to tell me about those comments forcing me to stand between the sides, so I repeatedly ask her to stop this and accept that he is the man making me happy.

Anyway, my boyfriend was willing to again swallow his pride, give up on the money and to talk like a normal family when visiting them and the baby the next day.

The next morning arrives and I'm texting my sister at what time we should come over. She just replied: as long as this isn't sorted out we should not visit them.

This is when I lost it and started to cry as I cannot understand why I'm being ""punished"" for this by not being allowed to see my little nephew who I love to death and was looking forward to see all week. So my boyfriend called BIL in my defense telling him that this is unacceptable and that they don't have to get along but there is no need to be mean to me about this. BIL just laughed it off. Then sister calls me and I, in my anger and frustration, tell her that she should know we don't care about money but it's unfair to expect everything for free because we are family when at any other occasion they don't accept us being a couple. I tell her she shouldn't have let this get between me and her and, I admit it, called BIL an arrogant and snobbish arsehole. Just when she started calling my live primitive I hang up and we have not spoken since.

As you can imagine there is quite a back story here but that would be too much for one post. So far, regarding this situation itself, AITA?

  
UPDATE:

  
Wow! Had no idea this post would go that far, that fast. Thank you very much for your NTA verdict and the very nice and honest comments! I tried to answer as many as possible and will let you know some more details here:

1. Yes, my boyfriend has been compensated for the parts and - guess what - BIL left the money for the work in our mailbox last night! - without a word... So, sorry, no petty revenge needed right now ;-) It's not our style anyway but you're ideas made me laugh and distracted me a little.
2. My mother loves my BF and feels very insecure around my sister and BIL as they are very judgemental towards her too. She however is afraid to speak up for us, as she fears my sister will not let her see her only grandchild then. Who am I to blame her? It hurts very bad but what she is doing there is just soooo wrong and I will do my best to protect my mum, too.
3. I agree with some of you stating that I was a lousy girlfriend letting my family go this far and I'm super happy and grateful my wonderful man still stands by my side. I'm sorry for everything that happened in the past and will stop the circle, now!
4. BIL used to be kind of a carpenter, then clay modeler and now works at an office doing something with graphic design. Everything has to be clean and tidy at all times and he used to be embarrassed being seen in work clothes in public - ridiculous.
5. What will I do? I decided to go / stay NC with my sister and BIL and already notice how liberated and relieved I'm feeling. Maybe I will write a letter telling her how I feel and insist on the apology she owes us. But I don't know if it will be possible to ever have a good relationship with her. The relationship with my BF however has never been better as I finally 100% realised how much I love him and that he is the one I want. I would marry him from the spot but he married young and after being divorced he doesn't want to repeat this experience. It doesn't matter.

The plan was, Friday afternoon I (18F) would pick my brother up from school when it finished at 3pm, since I was scheduledto finish my shift at 2pm. And his friend would pick him up at around 4pm. Giving him an hour to finalise his packed bag, and do his portion of the chores.

He asks me to come and pick him up from the shopping centre opposite the school grounds, and apparently he had a head injury. Then hung up before I could ask any follow up questions.
So, I quickly sent him a text asking if he had told mum.
Because all the information I had, was he had a head injury and was not on school grounds.
I didn't get a response, so I took matters into my own hands and called my mother.

Unsurprisingly (to me), he had not called mum.
So, she told me to wait at the top of the street, she will call him and then we'd go from there. 
She calls him 3 times and he doesn't answer any of them, but he answered her texts. 
Then, it wasn't until AFTER mum called him, that he responded to my text with ""I'm gonna.""

So, after some angry texts, he went back to school and went to student services to get basic medical attention. Mum told me not to pick him up, that she would. Because the school called and told her that his head injury was real, and he may need stitches.


By the end of it, mum called the friend's parents and told them he isn't going on the finish trip. They ended up in emergency care, and my brother got 5 stitches in his head.

70,1f36qvv,AITA for yelling at my mom?,"I (17M) and my mom (54F) and my brother (16M) moved from America to Chad a year ago under our mom's lie of a vacation. She told us it was a vacation, but in mid July she had our dad (69M) tell us that we should forget America and we will stay here. Around the beginning of August, she told us that she was talking to our dad to send us back for school and she told me that she was looking for the tickets, but a week before school started she and our dad told us that we will be staying here and we will be doing online school here. I got mad and confronted them, especially my mom for lying but they just got mad and my mom told my dad to send us to someone else's house.



Ever since we've been arguing with our parents about the type of school we've been going to. Btw the school we've been going to is an American online high school that is connected to a University, and it has limited number of AP classes, no honors classes, no extracurricular activities and you can't take the ACT or SAT in the area. All you do is just do online classes and leave. Me and my brother tried to tell our mom this, that we don't like this online school and that it is difficult (70% or above is passing), and we need to go back to America and do our school there. Every time we do this, she tells us to ask our father, when she knows damn well its her who decides in sending us back.



Three days ago, my, my brother, and my mom got into another major argument. My mom was doing our passports to send us back, and we got them back three days ago. When we asked my to send us back, she said that we are going to stay here and finish high school here. Me and my brother got angry and told our mom we have important stuff for school back in the US (before we left I was a sophomore and I did JROTC and took honors and AP classes and got decent grades, while my brother was a freshman and he did the math competition and got first place, did track, and took honors classes and an AP class that's hard to get into and got straight A's). She told us that there is nothing wrong with the school we are going to now and that we need to do these classes so we can graduate early (there's no point, I'm a senior while my brother is now a junior, there would've been a point if I was a junior and my brother was a sophomore, but none of us wants to graduate early). We told her we didn't want to graduate early because we weren't ready for it. We yelled at her that she was an asshole who loves controlling our choices for school and messing up everything we have in our lives, including our friendships. We also yelled at her that she only cared about herself and she only came here to give herself a better life, without giving a fuck about either of us. We also yelled at her that she was a liar who lies just make us have hope, just like she lied about how she was going to send us back once she got the passports. We then stormed off into our room.

We yelled at her that she was an asshole who loves controlling our choices for school and messing up everything we have in our lives, including our friendships. We also yelled at her that she only cared about herself and she only came here to give herself a better life, without giving a fuck about either of us. We also yelled at her that she was a liar who lies just make us have hope, just like she lied about how she was going to send us back once she got the passports. We then stormed off into our room.

Today I had my first day of school (I'm a senior in High School), and everything went well until one of my teachers pulled me to the side to talk about my hair.

She said she loves it, but it's ""not appropriate"" for school and she just wants me to look ""presentable"" and ""mature"". No other teacher (not even the principal) said anything. And to be honest, I'm wondering if the principal haven't said anything because she knew my teacher would, or does she just not care about the dresscode that much at this point.

The thing is, I was told by that teacher to do something about my hair by Monday. But I got it done literally yesterday, and I don't want that money to go to waste. But at the same time I don't wanna be dresscoded every day, especially since I don't know if she will just keep telling me tl change my hair or maybe even contact my parents?

I asked few of my friends and they all have different opinions. One says that my hair won't affect my education and I should keep it, the other says to just dye it all the same color or brown so it stands out less. But I really wanna keep it blonde.

I said no for two reasons. The main reason is that I don't want to put my girlfriend or her dad in a difficult/uncomfortable position.

I mentioned this to my girlfriend and she asked if she was invited. I said no as it was just the groups of us from university and no one is bringing their partners since it's just for us all to catch up. She said I shouldn't be going on holiday with other women as it's disrespectful.

I told her there was nothing wrong with going away with friends. She asked if it would impact out trip that we were looking at for February-March time next year. I said we'd still be able to go but it might be a night or two shorter.

She said I shouldn't be prioritising the trip with friends but I just pointed out this is probably the only time I'll be going away with them and there's nothing wrong with going away with friends. She just said again that it's disrespectful to be staying with other women and not inviting her.

To set some context, me and 'Jack' were together for 7 years, after 5 years together we decide to buy a house and have a baby. Which we did.  
But once baby turned one, he suddenly realised he doesn't want to be with me anymore.  
So we parted ways (on good terms), one of the reason being that I am too messy and he has OCD.  
I have ADHD, which makes it difficult for me to tiddy up straight away after myself, or it takes me a couple of hours to do a task that someone will do in minutes, I will be moving out in a month in a flat with my daughter as living in the house we bought together is too painful and the house is too big for just me and baby, I can't keep up with the mess and I feel oppressed in it.

Anyways, this is where it gets a bit complicated. We are not living together and although we are co-parenting, I am still the main parent, the one that has baby most of the time (she is now 16 months). When he comes over to give her dinner and shower her, change nappies etc, every time, he leaves everything out, nappies on the floor, and clothes too, food on the floor and table etc.

I have mentioned to him saying 'I get that I am usually the messy one, but I now live in the house we bought on my own, which I don't want to because it's too big for me and baby, and it's difficult for me to keep up with the tidying, and I would like it if you could clear things as you go, so I don't have to'.  
I know I have been messy, and I don't know if he does it because he doesn't realise it or just to give me a taste of my own medicine. I never did it on purpose, and always tried my best to stay as tidy as I could so we could get our relationship to work. But I am now , tired, single parent and can hardly keep up with work, nursery, food, cleaning etc.

Once I move out in the flat it will be much easier but until then I need all the help I can get, because we don't have a 'village'.

For context, my parents had a messy divorce when I was 15, and we lived with my grandma, with whom my mum never had a good relationship. We‚Äôve always had to struggle with money since that sad excuse of a human being (dad) had never pay child support. I graduated in 2021 and was lucky enough to get a job a few months later despite the covid lockdown. I moved out as soon as I got a job because I just can‚Äôt stay there anymore but do frequently come back since my place is only 40 minutes away. Last year my mum took my younger sisters (14, 16) and moved next door after fights with grandma (grandma owns house, previous tenant just moved out).

This also happened last year. She approached me out of the blue. We never talk, so this was pretty weird. She asked if I can loan her some money. She had always refused whenever I offered her money, and she never wear the stuffs I bought for her, so again weird. I was wondering if they‚Äôre behind bills or something, or worst if this is a medical emergency. So I asked what‚Äôs the money for? She snapped and said how she use the money is her business. I started getting pissed off and asked well since I‚Äôm loaning the money, don‚Äôt I have the right to know what the money is for? She said that I‚Äôm her daughter so the money I make is her money too. We fought a bit more , then she stormed off. 

The reason I asked was because she‚Äôd done this before back when I was in university. I was on scholarship and saved as much as I can of that money for emergencies. She called one day and asked if I can loan some money and I felt rude to ask why she needed it. The amount was a lot for a university student, but I did have some money saved up so I gave it to her. I found out from my older sister later that she used that money to pay off that sperm donor‚Äôs (dad) loan. I was pissed but didn‚Äôt say anything because what was I supposed to say to that? She‚Äôs still my mum.

I felt bad so after I‚Äôve calmed down a bit, I went to her and said I was sorry. That I was just worried she‚Äôd used it on that waste of space(dad) again. She was crying and that made me feel more guilty. She said that she‚Äôs not gonna do that again because she knows now that he‚Äôs just a piece of shit. This is huge because I‚Äôve never heard her blame him for ruining her life before. So I just gave her the money and said she never had to pay me back for anything. 

I had always felt guilty for asking. Was I not supposed to? Is it rude to ask the woman who raised me why she needed money? Maybe the way I worded it out was wrong and it came off as rude. My tone with her had always been like I‚Äôm on edge because I never know how she‚Äôll react. Am I the asshole?

81,1f33ngy,AITA for not paying with my boyfriend‚Äôs credit card?,"Throwaway and fake names for everyone. 

I (f26) and my boyfriend ‚ÄòJohn‚Äô (m27) have been together for 4 years and we have a mutual friend ‚ÄòEmily‚Äô (f26). I grew up fairly poor with very little extra income, Emily grew up not ‚Äúrich‚Äù but quite comfortable, and let‚Äôs just say John is in a completely different tax bracket. 

I have my own job and my own money, it‚Äôs not nearly as much as John makes but we‚Äôve sorted out who pays what based on percentages and it works for us and we communicate well in general, so if there are any problems things are easily resolved. 

John has given me a second credit card to his account and offers to pay for things I need/want very often, but I only use it for things for both of us, emergencies, or times when I don‚Äôt have enough on me and I try to pay him back quickly. 

Last night Emily and I went out for dinner and for coffee or dessert afterwards. Emily knows that I have John‚Äôs credit card because she saw me spend quite a bit on John and I‚Äôs home when we were shopping one day. 

Emily asks if I can cover for her until she gets paid within a week. I agree because she normally pays me back when she says she will. I normally wouldn‚Äôt lend money to people unless they desperately need it but up until last night I trusted Emily completely. 

When we get to the restaurant, she picks what she wants on the menu, orders a normal size meal and then proceeds to flag down the server throughout the night and order a ridiculously expensive appetizer, many expensive items, sides, drinks etc. I only got myself one entr√©e with a side and a drink. 

Throughout the whole meal, Emily keeps mentioning how nice John is, that he gives me money and pays for things that I want and that every girl deserves someone who can spoil them. When the check comes, I pay for everything using my own money. 

A week later, when Emily agreed to pay me back she sends me a text message saying:
‚ÄúI hope John doesn‚Äôt mind if I wait for another two weeks, I‚Äôve already spent my paycheque‚Äù 
to which I replied:
‚Äúactually I paid that out of my own money, why would you assume that I used John‚Äôs money especially for something he wasn‚Äôt apart of?‚Äú 

Emily then went on a text rant accusing me of being an asshole for having a rich boyfriend and agreeing to cover for her, even though she knows I use his card for joint items or emergencies only. She says that if she were in my place, she would treat all of her friends it‚Äôs just the right thing to do, especially since she‚Äôs mutual friends with both of us. she told me John should just cover the difference that I‚Äôm missing.

AITAH for telling my brother he's dead to me? 

Background Context!!
So I (29 F) Have a younger brother (23 M) and we've been living in our parents garage apartment for 3 years now. He doesn't work nor does he pay the bills. And he frequently brings his buddies over and trashes the entire house almost every weekend. Now I'm not trying to brag here... But I have a job. I pay the rent and the electric bill. I also pay half of the Internet bill. I also do most of the chores around the house as our parents can't really do much. I also do most of the grocery shopping as my brother doesn't think he should because he doesn't work. 

Now onto the story...
I have a boyfriend (28). And we're looking to getting a place together with just the two of us. My brother hated the idea and decided to tell our mother about the whole situation. Now... My brother being the youngest... Has always been a bit of a crybaby when it comes to not having things his way. So naturally he got upset and yelled at my mom about how he shouldn't have to stay there while I move in with my boyfriend. My mother calmy told him that he can get himself a job and move out if he wants they're not going to force him to stay there. And that he shouldn't be having multiple people over because they can't seem to clean up after themselves. I chimed in because I didn't know what he was going to say next. I told him that he doesn't need to yell at Mom because of what I choose to do and that it's none of his business. He can go be a lazy man child if he wants to. I'm going to do something for myself. 

He got so mad that he started kicking the chairs and screaming like a four year old. Yes... A 23 year old mad screaming like a little child. My father got up from his recliner and told him that he can go stay a night or two with his buddies if he wants to act like a child about my mother simply trying to reason with him. 

And that's when my brother did the unthinkable... He tackled my father and started screaming at him.  Which is weird considering he's NEVER done anything like that before. My mother was crying and yelling. My boyfriend pulled him off my father. I slapped my brother across the face and told him that he's now dead to me and that he's never to step foot on this property ever again. I even told him that I don't see him as my brother anymore. 
My father and my mother are reasonably shaken up. 

He called some of my family members to complain about me slapping him and saying that to him. And now I'm getting mixed messages from both sides of my family. Some are calling me a terrible sister for ever doing that. And others are telling me I did the right thing. My boyfriend and I are now with my parents until they can calm down from this. I hope to never speak to him ever again.

Now, Sam is saying I owe Dean an apology. It‚Äôs literally destroyed our friendship.

86,1f32pqj,AITA for denying help for a lady I know.,"Hello Reddit.  
  
Background.  
I am part of a nonprofit charity organisation that helps people to fix their homes.  
When I was a kid I liked the TV show ""Extreme Makeover - Home Edition"" and as an adult, when I had enough resources I decided to do something similar myself, but without cameras, rushing and fake reactions.  
As I own a construction company, the main part I provide is leftovers from building sites, but we also have multiple other members who contribute their time, money or resources.

Our main focus is people who need better living standards, like hot water, and a bathroom with running water, or just heating as things like that can be too expensive for single parents, disabled people or seniors.  
  
Often we help families whose home was damaged in an accident (fire, flood, etc) and they lack resources to fix it. (Insurance companies often don't cover old buildings in bad shape, but people in need often live in buildings like that)

What happened?  
One day our organisation received an email about a fire in an apartment building and the name of the person in need was familiar, it was the best friend of my ex, let's call her ""Ruby"".  
So I wrote to her and found out, that a robot vacuum cleaner exploded in her apartment and started a fire, the whole apartment needs rebuilding, as like many newer apartment buildings, the walls inside the apartment are mostly drywall and fire and extinguishing after it destroyed pretty much everything inside. For whatever reason she had no insurance - the neighbour downstairs whose home was flooded had insurance, the neighbour upstairs whose home had smoke damage had insurance, and even the building itself had insurance, so the facade and windows will get replaced, but the building insurance does not cover anything inside the apartment.

At first, it sounded like a great candidate for help, but I know Ruby, I know that she owns another apartment she inherited and rents out! So I asked about that - ""Couldn't you sell it?

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-28,"AITA for denying help for a lady I know. Hello Reddit.  
  
Background.  
I am part of a nonprofit charity organisation that helps people to fix their homes.  
When I was a kid I liked the TV show ""Extreme Makeover - Home Edition"" and as an adult, when I had enough resources I decided to do something similar myself, but without cameras, rushing and fake reactions.  
As I own a construction company, the main part I provide is leftovers from building sites, but we also have multiple other members who contribute their time, money or resources.

Our main focus is people who need better living standards, like hot water, and a bathroom with running water, or just heating as things like that can be too expensive for single parents, disabled people or seniors.  
  
Often we help families whose home was damaged in an accident (fire, flood, etc) and they lack resources to fix it. (Insurance companies often don't cover old buildings in bad shape, but people in need often live in buildings like that)

What happened?  
One day our organisation received an email about a fire in an apartment building and the name of the person in need was familiar, it was the best friend of my ex, let's call her ""Ruby"".  
So I wrote to her and found out, that a robot vacuum cleaner exploded in her apartment and started a fire, the whole apartment needs rebuilding, as like many newer apartment buildings, the walls inside the apartment are mostly drywall and fire and extinguishing after it destroyed pretty much everything inside. For whatever reason she had no insurance - the neighbour downstairs whose home was flooded had insurance, the neighbour upstairs whose home had smoke damage had insurance, and even the building itself had insurance, so the facade and windows will get replaced, but the building insurance does not cover anything inside the apartment.

At first, it sounded like a great candidate for help, but I know Ruby, I know that she owns another apartment she inherited and rents out! So I asked about that - ""Couldn't you sell it? Move there?"" she replied, ""I don't want to lose my passive income!"" I replied, ""Sorry, but we help people who have nothing, we help people who have no passive income that could be used for resolving the problems.""

87,1f32ela,AITA for asking my roommate to respect our shared kitchen by cleaning it,"I (20M) have just started the new semester here at my university in the same apartment I used last year. One roommate is from the previous year (who's chill) and two are new. One of the new ones is nice, but the other is kind of difficult. I can't tell if it's just a cultural difference because he is from Nigeria and studied a bit in Russia. The reason why I say this is because both of these countries are collectivist and I am from the United States which is individualistic. I think that when you do something like make a mess in the kitchen, it is your responsibility rather the responsibility of other people to clean it up. But that's ultimately where our issue is coming from which is regarding the kitchen.

In my mind, I think that if I'm going to be making a mess in the kitchen, it is my responsibility to clean up the mess. My roommate who I'm having the difficulty with says that cleaning the kitchen should be a shared responsibility regardless of who makes the mess. The only issue is, he is the only person who makes serious messes which include things like leaving food on the counter and floor (not in a container), leaving dirt on the floor which turn into stains, and overall just refusing to clean up. He also has taken over a majority (80%) of the refridgerator space including the freezer and the pantry. I would think that a shared responsibility of cleaning and maintaining the kitchen would mean an equal sharing of the space that each person can use of the kitchen, but when I talk to him about this, he disagrees and ignores what I say and just repeates the same thing about how we should share. I don't really feel like this is a cultural issue anymore, but rather he's just testing the boundaries of how far he can push me and my roommates around.

I also want to add that he uses other people's kitchen tools and has now damaged my set of knives and one pot which I've had to now dispose of. He repeatedly talks about how as individuals, we have to work together to keep the place clean and that we should all act like mature adults. This part is what ticks me off the most as the only person who is acting immature is him by not listening to my concerns and treats the kitchen as his own personal one and rather than one that is used by the apartment. Like, we both have the same end goal of keeping the apartment clean, but we have two fundamentally different ways of doing so. He expects me to do my share of cleaning (which I've done because I've been forced to clean up after him), but I have not seen him once do his share of cleaning.

I've talked to my roommates and they agree with the idea of whoever makes the mess should be the one to clean it and to be respectful of other people's property. Also, I've had discussions with him now multiple times, and he just does not seem to understand my point of view at all. He has not indicated that he wants to compromise.

When I first met Amy in community college last year, she was in a really bad place in life and wasn‚Äôt getting much support from her then partner. She was in a transphobic and homophobic household, so she was pretty much forced to stay in the closet for her own survival. I did my best to offer advice on how to remedy things but there was little I could do as an outsider.

Amy had severe depression among other mental health problems. She was prescribed medicine but refused to take them. I suggested reaching out to crisis hotlines or a therapist when shit was hitting the fan at home. She refused all my advice.

Amy would also harass her ex online because this ex was really toxic. I told her dozens of times to just ghost her but Amy always made the excuse that she can‚Äôt because she buys art commissions from ex and can‚Äôt find a better artist.

This was all in State #1, my family moved to State #2, then she and her family visited us there on their way to move to State #3. We are both now in State #4.

92,1f31cds,AITA for standing on a treadmill after my sister asked me not to,"My adult siblings (older sister, younger brother) and I live together in my parent's household.

The issue is my sister bought a walking pad a while back. It was a big purchase for her so shes a little protective of it. Not itself an issue, she did spend her own money on it.

My problem is she gets upset when you stand on it/walk over it. She says it causes unnecessary wear and tear(true, but arguably neglible amounts.) She doesnt have an issue with anyone using it when it's *on* but when it's off, you can't step on it or she'll throw a fit.

This is an issue because she keeps it up against the fireplace where the tv and entertainment stuff is. This is because she wfh downstairs and her standing desk is in the livingroom.

But because her treadmill is in the living room, often im pacing and talking, and ill absentmindedly stand on it or pace over it, because quite frankly it's a treadmill and it's there. I don't even think about it, it's just instinct. She's asked me several times to stop but I cant help it. I also don't feel like I should have to, as again, neglible damage.

Today she saw me standing on it for 30 seconds. I was trying to peer behind the tv, and it was there so i stepped on it for a step up w/o thinking.

She blew up saying I need to stop overstepping her boundary. 

Here's where I am likely an asshole: I said my usual piece about how standing on it isnt causing enough damage to get so worked up, and said she could have her boundary ""but I find it kinda stupid.""

We got into it about how it doesnt matter if I dont get it and that I still have to respect it. I said shes overreacting and theres no reason to ""call it a boundary"", it's not that deep. She argued to her it is, and again I dont need to understand it but I need to respect it and to stop. I told her, maybe if it wasnt out in the open then, and she conceded, albeit annoyed, that she would move it to under her standing desk so it isnt in the way. It's still jutting out from the desk which is in the living room too, so it didnt really change much, but now it's not directly in front of the fireplace at least.

My brother mostly agreed with me although he says im an asshole because shes told me multiple times. But that renewed the whole argument where my sister basically said ""you can have an opinion on it but you dont get to voice it to me because I paid for it and you need to respect my boundaries."" Again, im probably an asshole here bc my brother and I were laughing at her (tbf tho, I think it's intrinsically funny that you can walk on it and cause actual wear and tear, but that standing on it for a few seconds is banned) and saying it's unreasonable/doesnt make any sense. But she says it doesn't matter that it doesn't make sense, you cant make fun of other people's boundaries.

I told her, maybe if it wasnt out in the open then, and she conceded, albeit annoyed, that she would move it to under her standing desk so it isnt in the way. It's still jutting out from the desk which is in the living room too, so it didnt really change much, but now it's not directly in front of the fireplace at least.

My brother mostly agreed with me although he says im an asshole because shes told me multiple times. But that renewed the whole argument where my sister basically said ""you can have an opinion on it but you dont get to voice it to me because I paid for it and you need to respect my boundaries."" Again, im probably an asshole here bc my brother and I were laughing at her (tbf tho, I think it's intrinsically funny that you can walk on it and cause actual wear and tear, but that standing on it for a few seconds is banned) and saying it's unreasonable/doesnt make any sense. But she says it doesn't matter that it doesn't make sense, you cant make fun of other people's boundaries. I know on that count shes technically right but... it's really hard not to find this particular one silly.

96,1f30jg9,AITA for not being there for my (25f) best friend (30f) when she needed me most?,"Backstory: 2 years ago, I noticed that something was wrong with my best friend. She wasn‚Äôt as responsive over the past week to my texts or calls. This was odd as she is a chatty person. I had texted her ‚Äúare you okay?‚Äù to check in. She then starts sending me messages about how she hasn‚Äôt been okay for weeks and she feels gaslit by me asking this question because, according to her, she has been making it clear that she hadn‚Äôt been okay lately. I told her that this was not clear to me at all. We went back and forth, and I felt that her tone was argumentative with me. As a result she requested space from me, which I respected. 

We reunited 8 months later. Our solution was this: she would be more clear when expressing her needs. 

Things started happening again recently, only this time, I noticed her behavior becoming more strange. She used to speak so highly of me, but during this time, she started becoming more negative around me. Critiquing everything I did, and just overall becoming more judgmental. I felt dumb around her, and began to believe the judgmental things she would say about me. I started pulling away from her, unconsciously at the time. 

It then dawned on me that this is how she acted the last time she was going through it, which caused me to pull away. It made me realize that this happened last time, and that‚Äôs why she had become so reactive towards me and I was just completely unaware of it. 

I sent her a recording of me explaining my feelings. I did so via recording so that she wouldn‚Äôt read into ‚Äútext tones‚Äù and misunderstand my intent, which was to express myself in a gentle way. She then became reactive over text. I don‚Äôt remember all the details because I lowkey dissociated during this fight, but she did me a liar for not knowing she was going through it the last time, and telling me that I have personal problems. I became very defensive in response. 

We took a break from the fight and I apologized for my response. I tried to initiate having a more peaceful conversation, saying that I want to have this be a space where we can talk to each other about our feelings and needs without attacking each other. But she pushed back, saying I am too sensitive and that I was sharing a ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù (when recalling the way she was talking to me during our fight). I told her I could no longer talk to her as I felt manipulated and I stopped trusting her at this point. 

She then called my ex and talked about me. She tried to get him to side with her that there was something wrong with me. Luckily he went to me right afterwards and told me about her behavior. She then texted my mom about how she was worried for me because I am seeing ‚Äútwo different realities‚Äù. She also lied about events between me, her and my ex. She has since also spoken to my dad on the phone about ‚Äúmy problems‚Äù. 

AITA for how I handled this?

More Info: This is why she was upset with me, both times. Overall, she struggles with change. The first change was that I moved to a new city, and she moved with me. The second most recent time is that she got a new job. I didn‚Äôt really understand both reasons until after the fight was started.

97,1f307jg,AITA for not babysitting ,"Last year my sister had offered for me to move into her house because I was having issues in my current living situation. I‚Äôm 25 and she‚Äôs 38 with two young kids. I‚Äôve always been the sibling to call for aunty duties ever since they were born, they are now 6. I‚Äôve also been watching her kids while she works nights during summer months between college semesters, during the pandemic and even the weekends post-grad when I got my first full time job. When she had offered to me that I can move into her house she had a nanny at the time who took care of her kids while she worked (ex: getting them ready for school, picking them up from the bus, watching them on weekends) so I wasn‚Äôt going to be the main one watching them except for overnight while she‚Äôs at work.
Within a few months of me being there, her and the nanny had a disagreement and fell out. I also had a long commute to work which put a toll on my health since I have a chronic condition. Ultimately I decided to quit my job for my health and search for other jobs closer, but this has taken a bit longer since the job market sucks right now. My sister saw this as an opportunity for a trade off where now I can watch her kids essentially full time and she‚Äôll essentially let me stay with her. My sister has also been having financial issues which is why she works almost 5-7 days a week, so I empathize with her and understand her situation.
My sister was able to get morning help for her kids to alleviate the physical toll it would have on me, but I still do everything else. I pick them up from the school bus, make them dinner, do their night routine, help with hw, play with them when they ask me too, watch them overnight, and watch them on the weekends while she‚Äôs working or when needed. Whenever I want to make plans with either my friends or boyfriend I have to essentially give her a notice ahead of time so she can find childcare. I‚Äôm always asking her ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your schedule this week‚Äù to accommodate her and also gauge what plans I can make. This has been the arrangement for almost a year now and at first I was fine with it and wanted to help her as much as I could but overtime I am getting burnt out. Her kids are great, but being and taking care of kids all the time has become very hard for me and quite annoying.
I want to be able to have more freedom since I am still in my twenties and she is much older than me. I am also still figuring out my career path and want to focus on my life. She started noticing that I wasn‚Äôt becoming as open to watching them or wanting to take them to their weekend activities. She thinks my behavior is unfair and that I should be willing to still be open to it. She also expects me to be on top of the chores, which I do, but get easily exhausted and mentally drained from the whole situation and may not get to everything at once. She‚Äôs had moments where she acknowledges how grateful she is for my help, but I am ready for a change and even plan on moving out when the new year arrives. AITA?

98,1f2znch,WIBTA for not going to a concert with my younger sister,"I (19F) have two younger sisters (17F) and (14F). Recently over the past few weeks I have been interested in a group of artists music but I‚Äôve only recently found out that they are having a concert in my area later this year and became interested in going. These tickets had already been out for a few months and I had only decided to go about 2 or 3 days ago. I would like to preface and say that these tickets are not cheap. The majority of the more reasonable seating is around $250-300 with the more expensive ones being closer to $400. (Not American $250=$170 USD)

I offhandedly mention to my middle sister that I‚Äôm interesting in going to this concert when she tells me that her and her friend along with her friends mum have also bought tickets to this concert a few months ago. They‚Äôre not in a bad spot but I have found a few better single seats that have a slightly better view for around the same price in a different section. 

While I was doing all this my youngest sister mentions that she would also like to go. The only problem is that the seat that I want to get doesn‚Äôt have one next to it and my middle sister also doesn‚Äôt have an available one next to her. My parents ask if I can choose a seat further back in my middle sisters section (as there isn‚Äôt any double seating in the section I‚Äôm looking at) so that she can come with me (I‚Äôm not expected to pay for her ticket).

This is where I may be the asshole. I don‚Äôt really want to pick one of those seats. This is my own money that I‚Äôm spending and it‚Äôs a lot of money. I don‚Äôt want to spend around the same amount for a worse view further back. My parents and my younger sister however see this as me purposely excluding her and bullying her just because I don‚Äôt want to spend time with her. My decision has nothing to do with her. 

Some additional information that might be relevant. All three of us are going to see a different artist next year together which we all booked together. My parents won‚Äôt allow my sister to go on her own (very understandable). My parents themselves don‚Äôt want to go and spend that much money for artists they don‚Äôt know so won‚Äôt take her themselves. Also both sections are in the stands on the same level which are slanted.

This has all happened over the past 2 days and we‚Äôve already talked about it a few times but they still disagree with me. I haven‚Äôt bought my ticket yet but I do plan to do so within the next day or so.

In order to pay for my fees and equipment, I work a part-time job at the Dick's Sporting Goods location a couple blocks from my house. My best friend (18M) is in the grade above me, and we've been practicing our shot together during the summers since we were in middle school. He doesn't have a great home life because his mom (\~45 F) is addicted to heroin, but he's an adult now, so he's doing fine for what it's worth. It's important you know that a couple years back, his mother sold my PS4 and laptop on Facebook Marketplace in order to pay for drugs.

Although she hasn't stolen from us since, we've had plenty of stressful moments looking out for her.

Two weeks back, I saved up for a machine that would collect shot basketballs with a tarp and send them back with a motor after they fell from the hoop. After assembling it during the afternoon, I invited my friend over to try it. Instantly, we became hooked. The machine's not necessary, but it makes practicing for long hours so much easier.

101,1f2ytv4,AITA for wanting mum to take it easy at work?,"I (32 male) came back home to help my mum (52) with my baby sister and look after the house. The reason I'm helping out with this is because mum has an aneurysm which will be operated on later this year, so my coming was supposed to relieve her of housework (since my stepdad is a macho man who doesn't soil himself with house chores) and help her recuperate after some invasive exams she's having to do in preparation for the surgery. 

Mum is a full time elementary school teacher in the public system. She leaves for work at 5:30am everyday, arrives back home around 8pm every day - she works in a neighbouring city and her comute is crazy. On top of her school responsibilities she gets involved with school extra curricular activities as much as possible, which increases the amount of time she's at work by at least 5 to 10 hours every week. She doesn't have to, but she's very friendly with her colleagues and taking part in these activities is her way of spending time with friends. During weekends she's frequently also busy preparing school work or doing craft things for the extra curricular events the school throws.

Today we had an argument because after she got home (at 10:30 tonight) I again asked her to take better care of herself and to take it easy with her routine, both because of her health issue and also because - god forbid - if something happens to her in surgery, these could be the last few months we'd get to be together. She scolded me for not being respectful of her choices and how she chooses to invest her time. I retorted that there must be a middle ground where she doesn't need to spend 14 to 18 hours at work + comute multiple times a week. 

I don't think I'm being selfish - I genuinely just want her to avoid overworking and to be mindful of the death bubble in her brain - but after the discussion I did start feeling guilty because hell I'm not the kind of guy that tells women what they should be doing.

107,1f2wtwq,AITA for agreeing with my sister's brother in law?,"So I don't know how to begin this, but I'll try to be understandable.
My sister, Delilah is 23F, her husband, Kenji is 25M. I am 27F, and I think her brother in law is 24M.

So to start my sister is really food sensitive if that's what you'd call it. She gets ""sick"" when she smells or eats certain foods, its been like this ever since she was 13. 

Just usually meals, condiments or snacks. For example: Ranch, eggs, chicken, bacon, beans, ketchup, mayo, mustard, maple syrup, and even cakes/cupcakes.
In my honest opinion I think she's faking, or at least exaggerating. She's not allergic to anything, not even pollen, and she doesn't have a medical diagnosis either. It just ""is how it is"" by her words.

So to the drama, we were all at dinner. Mostly our family and my sisters family. So it was a big dinner. We were cooking some of the food Delilah's ""sensitive"" to and she said she was going to go outside. By the way she doesn't make a fuss about it, she just tells someone where she's going, then comes back a bit later.

We all started eating, she came back at this time, and her brother in law started asking why she constantly went out the house tonight and every other event/family dinner. Delilah said it was nothing important and she wasn't feeling well. 
He continued to ""perster"" her until she told him she just didn't like how the food smelled. Let me mention that Delilah and my family don't speak English as our first language, and she has pretty bad grammar. 
Her brother in law took this as an insult and insulted her back a few times. Delilah ""apologized"" and said their food was wonderful and she didn't want to make it a big deal as it was. 

I said that I agree with brother in law and that she subtly wants attention, that she's been doing these ""food sensitivity"" thing for to long and it's frankly embarrassing for everyone and especially her husband.
She told me to have some respect since she's paying my rent. And obviously I told her back ""what the fuck??"" And why the hell she'd point that out in an attempt to embarrass me. 

She stayed quiet and didn't really talk to me or my brother in law, when we tried talking to her she ignored us. But did not do that to anyone else.

She told me a while back her husband has no issue with it and he's fine. Again, in my honest opinion she's forcing her husband to go on this weird ass diet so she can stay skinny or something.  I say that because she never really developed, I mean she was less than 120 pounds her entire childhood and teenhood. And alot of people including myself commented on it. 

So she's probably trying to stay that way. Her husband told me to chill out after the dinner, not sure what he told brother in law.

At this shop, they have a pachinko board where if you get a quarter into the little ice cream, you get a coupon for a free single scoop of ice cream. Needless to say, I won it. I texted my mom that I won a free scoop and if she wanted me to use it for her (since I know she likes their ice cream) she said sure, but then sends me an order for a 2 scoop and a one scoop ice cream. When I questioned why she asked for 3 total scoops and reiterated the coupon was for a single scoop, her exact response was ‚ÄúI have to take an advantage of your offer üòò‚Äù. I think she was trying to place another order for my grandmother. Then my buddy had an epiphany. He was planning on making his own homemade ice cream for me later in the week, and since our other friend was only in town for a few days, he suggested he makes the ice cream tonight. That way she could still have ice cream, and we could make it for our Canadian friend. I sent her a text saying nevermind, Friend A is going to make his ice cream tonight. So we left and I do still have the coupon.

We get home and she asks where the ice cream is, to which I said that I sent a text telling her of the change of plans, she says ‚Äúwell I don‚Äôt want that ice cream. Why is it ok for you to have store‚Äôs ice cream but not me?‚Äùbefore walking away in a bit of a huff.

In the grand scheme of things this is just a small issue, and I could very well be the asshole for not doing this small gesture, but I feel a bit disrespected by her for trying to take advantage of my gift, and then getting mad when I feel like I gave a reasonable alternative. 
 
My friends are saying while she has a valid reason to be mad, but her response was overblown. However I wanted a neutral opinion as while I‚Äôm miffed about this whole situation, I also do feel guilty.

When I questioned why she asked for 3 total scoops and reiterated the coupon was for a single scoop, her exact response was ‚ÄúI have to take an advantage of your offer üòò‚Äù. I think she was trying to place another order for my grandmother. Then my buddy had an epiphany. He was planning on making his own homemade ice cream for me later in the week, and since our other friend was only in town for a few days, he suggested he makes the ice cream tonight. That way she could still have ice cream, and we could make it for our Canadian friend. I sent her a text saying nevermind, Friend A is going to make his ice cream tonight. So we left and I do still have the coupon.

We get home and she asks where the ice cream is, to which I said that I sent a text telling her of the change of plans, she says ‚Äúwell I don‚Äôt want that ice cream. Why is it ok for you to have store‚Äôs ice cream but not me?‚Äùbefore walking away in a bit of a huff.

In the grand scheme of things this is just a small issue, and I could very well be the asshole for not doing this small gesture, but I feel a bit disrespected by her for trying to take advantage of my gift, and then getting mad when I feel like I gave a reasonable alternative. 
 
My friends are saying while she has a valid reason to be mad, but her response was overblown. However I wanted a neutral opinion as while I‚Äôm miffed about this whole situation, I also do feel guilty.

110,1f2wqk2,AITA for telling my(24M) friend(25M) his girlfriend said to not hug him,"I have been friends with my close friend Brian for 4 years. We met sophomore year of college and still hang out pretty often and go to the gym together for like an hour and a half every day. About 6 months ago he started dating this chick Alice. Alice doesn‚Äôt like me. I didn‚Äôt get it at first, but I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôs convinced herself that I want to fuck her boyfriend.

She doesn‚Äôt like it when he spends nights at my place or I at his. She got mad at him one time when he let me shower at his place. It‚Äôs just weird vibes. She‚Äôs also very catty in a way that‚Äôs not cute and kinda bitchy.

Now first off, Brian is straight. He has never even questioned his sexuality. I have no clue why she thinks I‚Äôm in a position to steal her man. Beyond that, nothing should matter. Let‚Äôs say hypothetically I thought that he was hot, it doesn‚Äôt matter because he‚Äôs not gonna fuck me anyways. So it‚Äôs kinda ridiculous to be this threatened by me.

So I‚Äôm a pretty physically affectionate person. I hug all of my friends when I see them, including Brian. A few weekends ago, I went over to Brian‚Äôs place to pick him up for something and I hugged him. I went into his house while he continued to grab stuff before we left and I had a one on one conversation with me.

She told me she didn‚Äôt like how friendly I am with her man. I asked her what she meant by that and she said that she didn‚Äôt like how touchy I am with him. I said it was just a hug and she wouldn‚Äôt drop it. I said whatever and agreed so I could move on.

Last weekend we were all getting brunch and when Brian arrived I went to hug him and stopped myself. As I did, I said ‚Äúoops forgot I can‚Äôt give my bestie a hug anymore, my bad Alice‚Äù.

Everyone heard and it got very awkward. She stared daggers at me the entire brunch. She later that night texted me a huge paragraph mad about what I did and demanded an apology. I said she shouldn‚Äôt be talking about this with me and should be talking to Brian about it.

112,1f2wjxn,AITA for leaving the house while my mom is on vacation?,"TL;DR My mom went out of town and expected that I not leave the house at all while she‚Äôs gone to help with chores. I didn‚Äôt know this and left the house. 

For context, I [19F] live with my mom [60F] and dad [62M] on a farm.  I graduated highschool a year ago, and since then have been doing a lot more chores on the farm to pay for them housing me. I have always had to ‚Äúwork off‚Äù the money they spend on me, but now that I am out of school, the chores are more than a full time job at around 12-14 hours a day. If I have time on my hands, she tells me to find something extra to do. I do make a small income from a small, at-home business and can pay for my own clothes, transport, etc. 

A few days ago, my mom and my sister [23F] left for a 2 week long vacation. My brother [30M] and his wife [30F] work full time for my mom and so they are taking care of the farm and house along with my dad and I. 

Since my mom and sister have been gone, things have been really stress-free and the workload has been way easier, maybe 4-5 hours a day.

With all of the downtime, I decided to hang out with my brother and his wife, they live 10 minutes away. I got to go to their house and to the gym with them. While at the gym, my mom calls me and says she needs me to do an extra chore on the farm. I told her we were not home yet and she said it was fine. Earlier in the day, I‚Äôd taken a video of livestock we were selling, and she needed it for her customer, so she asked for me to Gmail it to her, since her poor reception made it come through grainy over text. I gmailed it to her and that was that. 

On our way home about an hour later, she calls me again, and says ‚Äúso you‚Äôre just not going to do anything I asked you to do? I just lost a big sale because of you.‚Äù I asked what she meant, and she said it was because I hadn‚Äôt done X chore and didn‚Äôt gmail her the video. I told her I‚Äôd gmailed it, and so I gmailed it again, and she still did not receive it. I also told her I hadn‚Äôt been home since she told me to do X Chore. She told me to ‚Äústop being a little brat‚Äù and hung up the phone. 

When I got home my dad was home and on the phone with her. She said how I wanted her to lose money and how she would never ‚Äúdo this to me the way I did it to her‚Äù and how she ‚Äúcan‚Äôt even go on vacation without me causing drama‚Äù. I walked inside after getting home and went straight to her PC so I could try and gmailing the video again. Then I went outside and did X chore. Still, my dad told me I need to ‚Äúdo better‚Äù and my sister told me I have to ‚Äúman up or else.‚Äù 

I originally really thought I had done nothing wrong and was trying my best, but now I think maybe it was expected that I stay home, or I should have asked my mom before going out. My brother and his wife think I did nothing wrong as my mom is ‚Äújust like that‚Äù. But my mom and my sister definitely think I‚Äôm the worst right now.

115,1f3oej7,AITA for removing my cat because I think my new flatmate is mistreating her?,"I [32F] got a new flatmate for my 2-bed flat that I also rent. She [34F], has never had a cat before, but was keen to live with one. 

Within 2 days of moving in, Flatmate brought in flowers deadly to cats, despite me telling her that my previous flatmate endangered my cat [10F] in a similar way. 

Fast forward 2 weeks, when I am woken up abruptly by yowling coming from Flatmate's bedroom. She then sends me a video saying ""I got my pick up certificate! :)"" In it, Flatmate is holding Cat by the *throat* to her face, smooching and shoving her face into her fur, while Cat is visibly unhappy and I can see her paws trying to push her away.

I told Flatmate that Cat doesn't like getting picked up, and only tolerates being handled by me or my partner for few mins max. I offer to teach her how to handle Cat, and read body language. During this conversation Flatmate says consecutively:

""I'd never pick up someone else's animal.""
""She jumped into my lap so I picked her up.""
""She let me pick her up and then changed her mind.""
""I never picked her up.""

A few days later, I come home and Cat is missing with Flatmate's door's shut. I text her re: Cat, as the door is closed over and she has no access to food, water, or litter. Flatmate was not happy but let the cat out.

Next morning, I am woken sharply by Cat's repeated yowls coming from other room, and Flatmate whispering ""shhh, shh, it's OK, good girl"" etc. I say from my bed ""What are you doing to her??"" loudly enough for Flatmate to hear but she *ignores* me. I hear Cat's paws hit the floor as she jumps down and runs away down the hallway. Flatmate goes about her morning and goes to work without acknowledgement.

I take Cat to my partner's and confront Flatmate. She starts crying and denies everything and is extremely offended that I ""reacted disproportionately"", that she ""can't believe you would think I'd hurt an animal"", ""I'm not an animal abuser, and for you to think that is seriously hurtful."" She denies that Cat was even in her room that morning.

I said that Cat only makes those distress noises under 3 circumstances she hates and only one applies here: she's being held against her will. Flatmate claims that is clearly untrue.

Flatmate says by removing Cat for the weekend, I've made a hurtful and offensive accusations that she can't move forward with and wishes to move out. At this point she is less than a month into the lease.

Flatmate says that moving forward, she does not want to be in the same house as Cat without me being present, and that her bedroom is now off-limits to her ""to protect myself"". This is quite impossible as I work long 12h+ shifts at the hospital, and with the commute, means that I am often not home for 15h of the day, multiple times a week. My partner is currently taking care of Cat for the time being.

AITA for removing my cat for her safety and protection, or was I paranoid and overreacted, which caused extreme offence?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-28,"AITA for removing my cat because I think my new flatmate is mistreating her? I [32F] got a new flatmate for my 2-bed flat that I also rent. She [34F], has never had a cat before, but was keen to live with one. 

Within 2 days of moving in, Flatmate brought in flowers deadly to cats, despite me telling her that my previous flatmate endangered my cat [10F] in a similar way. 

Fast forward 2 weeks, when I am woken up abruptly by yowling coming from Flatmate's bedroom. She then sends me a video saying ""I got my pick up certificate! :)"" In it, Flatmate is holding Cat by the *throat* to her face, smooching and shoving her face into her fur, while Cat is visibly unhappy and I can see her paws trying to push her away.

I told Flatmate that Cat doesn't like getting picked up, and only tolerates being handled by me or my partner for few mins max. I offer to teach her how to handle Cat, and read body language. During this conversation Flatmate says consecutively:

""I'd never pick up someone else's animal.""
""She jumped into my lap so I picked her up.""
""She let me pick her up and then changed her mind.""
""I never picked her up.""

A few days later, I come home and Cat is missing with Flatmate's door's shut. I text her re: Cat, as the door is closed over and she has no access to food, water, or litter. Flatmate was not happy but let the cat out.

Next morning, I am woken sharply by Cat's repeated yowls coming from other room, and Flatmate whispering ""shhh, shh, it's OK, good girl"" etc. I say from my bed ""What are you doing to her??"" loudly enough for Flatmate to hear but she *ignores* me. I hear Cat's paws hit the floor as she jumps down and runs away down the hallway. Flatmate goes about her morning and goes to work without acknowledgement.

I take Cat to my partner's and confront Flatmate. She starts crying and denies everything and is extremely offended that I ""reacted disproportionately"", that she ""can't believe you would think I'd hurt an animal"", ""I'm not an animal abuser, and for you to think that is seriously hurtful."" She denies that Cat was even in her room that morning.

I said that Cat only makes those distress noises under 3 circumstances she hates and only one applies here: she's being held against her will. Flatmate claims that is clearly untrue.

Flatmate says by removing Cat for the weekend, I've made a hurtful and offensive accusations that she can't move forward with and wishes to move out. At this point she is less than a month into the lease.

Flatmate says that moving forward, she does not want to be in the same house as Cat without me being present, and that her bedroom is now off-limits to her ""to protect myself"". This is quite impossible as I work long 12h+ shifts at the hospital, and with the commute, means that I am often not home for 15h of the day, multiple times a week. My partner is currently taking care of Cat for the time being.

116,1f3obx0,AITA for calling someone a stalker and setting boundaries ,", I'm a 29 Female and I am an LDS (mormon) member and I just came back from a mission just a few months ago. During my time out of home my cousin used to tell me about this 28 Male who has a crush on me since 2019 (He's Also a Lds) and that he came back from another city to my city just because of me but then he realized that I was out, so he would wait for me. We never dated, we weren't even close friends. So he started texting me and told me that he was waiting for his true loved one and that maybe she was knocking doors as a missionary, and other cringy and creepy messages like I was really pretty and he has the exaltation for me (that means marriage). So during that time he used to talk to my cousin a 31 Female, her husband and my aunt, all also are LDS and told them that he's in love with me for a long time and that I didn't had other option than marry him because he was the only single available of my age gap in our city that is part of the church (my cousin and her husband told me that) . He also told me stuff about my brother and the way he looks (long hair), about my idea of being the one who makes more money than my partner, that i shouldn't date a guy I was into just because he didn't attend college, and more things about his ex girlfriend. Moving a little bit forward, after I Arrived he started texting me and some of those messages were about he seeing me and telling me what I was wearing and where I was, which i think that's pretty creepy too, and after that he started sending me hearts, i told him that he was being a little bit of a stalker and I blocked him. Some weeks after i was at church and he was there with his mom so what i did was ignore everything and hide in another room, then i waited until they left and leave. A few days later i went with my aunt because I'm planning on moving out my dad's house to an apartment and it's near her house, so when i was with them my cousin told me that i shouldn't told that guy an stalker because he was trying to be nice to me and that i was wrong for not saying hi to him and his mom on church because he was so into me that the only thing that will make him happy was a word from me, but i don't want him near me, i don't want to be his friend and i told them that, but they told me that just for being a former missionary i have to be nice to him and i think that's stupid for the way he has been all this time. I also fell like my aunt and my cousin want me to date that guy so bad just because he is the son of my aunt's best friend and they want him to be part of the family. I don't know if you guys need more context but I'm getting sick of everything specially when every time i go to see them they bring him up to the topic we're talking and they always tell me that is pretty reasonable that he isn't my type but insist that I should be his friend and if I don't I'll embarrassed them for being rude. so Am I the Asshole for not speaking to him?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-28,"AITA for calling someone a stalker and setting boundaries  , I'm a 29 Female and I am an LDS (mormon) member and I just came back from a mission just a few months ago.

117,1f3ob84,AITA for not inviting my sister to my wedding because she didn‚Äôt invite me to hers?,"
So, some background: My sister and I have always had a complicated relationship. We‚Äôre not super close, but we‚Äôve always managed to stay cordial, mainly because of family gatherings and events. A few years ago, she got married, and I wasn‚Äôt invited. She claimed it was a small ceremony with only her husband‚Äôs family and a few close friends. I was hurt, but I didn‚Äôt make a big deal out of it and let it go.

Fast forward to now‚ÄîI‚Äôm getting married. My fianc√© and I are planning a slightly larger wedding with close family and friends. When it came time to send out invitations, I decided not to invite my sister. I felt like if she didn‚Äôt want me at her wedding, I shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to invite her to mine. 

My parents are furious and say I‚Äôm being petty and that I should be the bigger person. They insist that I invite her because ‚Äúfamily is family.‚Äù But to me, it‚Äôs more about reciprocation and not wanting someone at my wedding who didn‚Äôt think I was important enough to be at theirs. My fianc√© supports my decision but thinks it might cause unnecessary drama. 

Now, my sister found out she wasn‚Äôt invited and called me, upset. She said she didn‚Äôt invite me to her wedding because she was under a lot of stress at the time and regrets it now. She accused me of holding a grudge and ruining our relationship even further. 

I feel like I‚Äôm justified in my decision, but now I‚Äôm second-guessing myself. AITA for not inviting her?
