0,1f362uf,AITA for not wanting to go to work?,I'm 25 MtF pre transition. I'm going on studies in October. I wanted to start my transition as I go to college. Both transition and college costs a lot. And I don't have my own money. My parents were stopping me for the past 2 years with transition saying I should graduate first. I'm graduating in September and then going to another studies. And my parents told me to go to work. My major was music education. I completely burnt out for the past 5 years studying it. I don't wanna be a music teacher anymore and that's why I'm going to another studies. And my parents are telling me to go to work as a music teacher. That means I'd probably never transition. Am I The A$$hole for not going to work?,POO Mode Activated ðŸ’©,2024-08-28,AITA for not wanting to go to work? I'm 25 MtF pre transition. I'm going on studies in October.
