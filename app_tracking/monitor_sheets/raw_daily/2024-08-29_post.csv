0,1f3umhj,AITA for repeatedly using the incorrect pronouns?,"*For the sake of clarity between the word ""they"" and ""X"", I have replaced all theys with X where possible.* 

I've known this person for about a year now; I will refer to them as ""X"". X can be perceived as female due to feminine styles and actions, **but** does not identify with ""she/her"". X has repeatedly told me many times their preferred pronouns are ""it/they"". I have used ""she"" or ""her"" in X's presence, much to X's annoyance. X has also identified as non-binary. 

My background does not give me a lot of experience with trans or non-binary persons. While I do know of their existence and their struggles, I often cannot directly relate. They/them are pronoun pairs that are often used by persons identifying this way. However, as I don't often interact with trans/nb, I rarely use they/them as pronouns; exceptions are when I wish to anonymize someone who would otherwise be a he or she, or when referring to a group.   
This makes it hard for me to default to ""they"" when it is for a person, who may or may not be in the room with me. 

Now, as previously mentioned, ""it"" is also another pronoun I was asked to use. Due to my subconsciousness, I am unable to bring myself to refer a human being with ""it"". I do not think that way, and it isn't natural for me. Never have I looked at X and thought, ""it is wearing a cool outfit today"", but rather, ""she is wearing a cool outfit today."" I use ""it"" for objects or animals, but not humans. 



X has every right to be upset and angry that I cannot refer to them correctly, and I understand that completely. It is very upsetting and frustrating for someone to call you by something you're not, repeatedly, but how would I improve on this? It's a struggle for me but somehow our mutual friends don't seem to have an issue with using ""they"" for X. I just feel horrible that even after a year, I haven't been able to correctly address them. In terms of practicing, we don't interact often, and I don't have other trans/nb persons.
