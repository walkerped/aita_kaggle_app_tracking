0,1f3umhj,AITA for repeatedly using the incorrect pronouns?,"*For the sake of clarity between the word ""they"" and ""X"", I have replaced all theys with X where possible.* 

I've known this person for about a year now; I will refer to them as ""X"". X can be perceived as female due to feminine styles and actions, **but** does not identify with ""she/her"". X has repeatedly told me many times their preferred pronouns are ""it/they"". I have used ""she"" or ""her"" in X's presence, much to X's annoyance. X has also identified as non-binary. 

My background does not give me a lot of experience with trans or non-binary persons. While I do know of their existence and their struggles, I often cannot directly relate. They/them are pronoun pairs that are often used by persons identifying this way. However, as I don't often interact with trans/nb, I rarely use they/them as pronouns; exceptions are when I wish to anonymize someone who would otherwise be a he or she, or when referring to a group.   
This makes it hard for me to default to ""they"" when it is for a person, who may or may not be in the room with me. 

Now, as previously mentioned, ""it"" is also another pronoun I was asked to use. Due to my subconsciousness, I am unable to bring myself to refer a human being with ""it"". I do not think that way, and it isn't natural for me. Never have I looked at X and thought, ""it is wearing a cool outfit today"", but rather, ""she is wearing a cool outfit today."" I use ""it"" for objects or animals, but not humans. 



X has every right to be upset and angry that I cannot refer to them correctly, and I understand that completely. It is very upsetting and frustrating for someone to call you by something you're not, repeatedly, but how would I improve on this? It's a struggle for me but somehow our mutual friends don't seem to have an issue with using ""they"" for X. I just feel horrible that even after a year, I haven't been able to correctly address them. In terms of practicing, we don't interact often, and I don't have other trans/nb persons.

1,1f4h0zq,AITA for telling my mom to stop playing the victim,"So for context, my(F30) mom (F63)has always been very strict and critical with me, i moved out i few years ago but im on holidays in her house right now.

The other day i took out my nephews and spent some money on them, i went to the stylist and did something to my hair, bought some new make up… the thing is i have been spending this holidays, also on her, i took her out to eat and buy stuff for the house.

Yesterday i came to the house with some shopping and she started with criticism as always and she told me i would never have anything in life bc of my spending, that i should save and in that moment i didn’t think too much of it but today i told her i didn’t like the way she told me that yesterday, I am very independent, i don’t drink or smoke or go out to parties, i just work and go home, my car is paid and i don’t have any debts for her to say that.

Well, she said that what i would do when im older, that she worries about me, that she wants to go live far away so she doesn’t bother me and that she is afraid of being older and me having to take care of her because i won’t have patience with her so i told her to stop acting like the victim because I was just saying i didn’t like what she said it.

She left the house about two hours ago and i feel terrible but also i don’t know if AITA.

3,1f4ggnx,AITA for taking too long to finish some homework?,"I am currently in middle school. I have no idea what the ideal amount of homework teachers want here is Aus, but according to the guidelines of my school saying maximum 1 to 1.5 hours a day, I feel like there is too much as that I am spending over 3 hours of work on most days. However, this sparks my mother and she gets very angry on my time management.

Currently, school is just painful. I've got homework every day from at least 3 subjects and tests that I need to revise for, and my mother thinks that I should be able to do everything in the allocated time period and have spare time to play 2 hours of piano and revise for more co-curricular competitions. To me, this just isn't possible, and I spend more time, which apparently causes her to be mad and she screams at me almost every day. I have no idea why she is angry at me, as that I get above average grades and subject awards.

I am writing this about the most recent conflict I had with her. I was up at 10, doing some maths, when she came over and started to yell at me for not preparing for the competition that I was in. At that time, I had around 7 science mini-quizzes, 2 units of maths work, some climate change studies and a bit of digital tech tasks to complete, alongside with a practice formal letter for co-curricular classes. I had been looking at a bit of discord, and finished most of my science and maths work when she was complaining that I took too long. I have no idea why, but her approach to my issue was to keep me at home, tell me that she didn't need me to thrive and would be better off staying at home, stating that I wasted her precious time driving me to school. Now, I'm not some spoilt brat or a selfish being, but it barely takes 15 minutes to get me to school. She thinks that I am the reason why her wages aren't going up, even though she decided to stay and work home for majority of the week.

The day after, today, she has not sent me to school. She's telling me to go thrive on my own, and that I was only a waste of money. I had just woken up and finished all my maths, and completely practiced all of my competition questions. I'm wondering if this is even legal. Laws state that all kids from 6 to 17 are required to go to school.

I have no idea why she is pulling of such big of a deal. Even though I do take a bit of time to finish my work, I get everything on time. Again, I am only in middle school, and even all of the teachers and higher grade students had said during a speech that in lower years, middle school is a important time to get ready for senior years, but it isn't the most educationally important.

4,1f4fwig,AITA? Friend(21F) says I’m(21F) not doing enough. I think she’s asking too much.,"Okay, so, for context, we’ve been friends since highschool. We’re both in our final years of college now. We really bonded over a multiplayer game and became BFFs. I think we had a pretty normal relationship - sleepovers, hangouts, etc.

But now that we’re both grown up and in college, I’ve become more of a reserved homebody. I’ve always liked my alone time, but I guess I’ve grown to be more reserved now that her dorm is farther than walking distance from my apartment than it was in our hometown (we go to colleges that’re in the same city). We’ve recently been getting into discussions over how much we hangout and my tentative reactions to her requests.

This started because I was feeling a little overwhelmed by her constant requests to game, hangout, and sleepover during the semester. I brought this up to her, and she says she feels she’s the one doing all the work keeping the friendship going and that she’s scared I’ll find someone new and move on. I reflected and saw I was being cagey with myself, so I agreed with her and tried to hang with her more. Recently, we decided to try setting up a sort of hangout schedule for the semester to fix this.

But now, talking through things, we just can’t see eye-to-eye. Her ideal stresses me out just thinking about it. My ideal isn’t even close to enough for her.

More context: I go to school full-time and work a part-time job. She goes to school full-time, but doesn’t work. I have a car and so does she, but she doesn’t bring her car to school because she doesn’t feel comfortable driving in the city. So, whenever we hangout, I’m driving to her place, or driving her to mine. She will not uber or take the bus.

Her ideal: Hangout in-person once a week; sleepover once a month; gaming sessions throughout the week (no set amount).

My ideal: Hangout in-person OR gaming session about once biweekly (maybe more, depending on circumstances). No sleepovers until summer.

My problems are: To sleepover, I’d have to take a day off work when I already work very little, dropping my hours that week to around 17; our gaming sessions are 2 hours long each time, and I feel a hangout + gaming are just too much.

Her problems are: Sleepovers are her favorite, and she doesn’t want to restrict those to summer; we already hangout so little during the semester and summer, she doesn’t want to hangout even less.

She thinks my reluctance to hangout means I don’t like being around her, but I really just value my alone time! I dunno; I’m just a homebody, I suppose, but I like my solitude after class and work. I don’t hangout with anyone else as much as I do her; everyone else is maybe once a month, unless we have a class together or something. It’s not like anyone else is getting special treatment.

I feel like I'm stretching myself thin, but maybe it's wrong of me to want to hang so little. So, AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-29,"AITA? Friend(21F) says I’m(21F) not doing enough.

5,1f4f79b,AITA For Not Inviting Mutual Friends to My Birthday,"I (21/GF) was having my 21st birthday. I didn't invite a couple since they weren't that close with me, never asked me to hang out 1 on 1, rarely responded or sent texts first - even memes, & fought whenever they drank.

My attempts to hang out with the couple were brushed off - I didn’t mind, you can’t be close with everyone, so I stopped asking to hang out. I was still planning on inviting them clubbing that night so we could spend some time together if they wanted to, & could leave early if anything came up. Tho they both told me ""probably not.""

 I asked their roommate if they could not talk about it in front of the uninvited couple since it sucks to hear someone talking about an event youre not invited to. They told the couple anyway. 

They blew up, writing a many-paragraph essay to my partner about how upset they were, not telling me. My partner told me they wanted to talk in person & prepared for a conversation when we got to their place. However, they ignored me & didn't attempt to talk. I thought they needed some space & left them alone. The next few days were silent, until one posted a gig in our gc. 

I said I'd come & asked if my partner wanted to. One of the uninvited couple messages me privately (for the first time in this entire ordeal) & says I can't come. They said I could if I talked to them in person because I had been ""shit talking them in \[their partner's\] own home."" I responded with a voice message explaining calmly that I didn't mean to offend them and that sadly, I wouldn't be able to see them soon.

My wife (31F) works a nice job that pays extremely well (no hard labor), and the work I was doing before I became a stay at home dad wouldn’t even cover the cost of child care, so this situation makes a lot of sense for us. 

My daughter loves to play with me when it is just the two of us, but she definitely picks her mother over me any day that she is home. I basically become a nuisance in her mind that might take away her time with her mom. My wife got her out of bed this morning and then when I walked in the room she screamed “Daddy no!” Which hurts a bit but she’s two and that’s fine. She has no idea what she’s doing really. 

Today has been particularly bad. She refuses to do anything with me, and screams if I try to initiate anything. Just for example: I grabbed a book of hers and asked if she wanted me to read it to her. She came up to me and grabbed the book, said “Mommy!” And brought it over to her mother to read to her. That’s basically what happens with everything. 

So, after several attempts to be involved and being rejected, I sat on the couch and pulled out my phone to relax as my wife did the entertaining for about 2-ish hours.

9,1f4e4f1,AITA for lashing out at my friend for trying to give me advice ,"Okay, I’ll try to describe everything as concise as possible 

Me (20F) and my friend (23M), I’ll call him O have been close friends for over a year now. In this year we’ve had frequent disagreements over various topics and issues. Along with this I noticed that O takes it upon himself to give advice on my life topics even when they aren’t asked for. I don’t mind his unasked for advice. So it has never caused an actual conflict between us until very recently. 

Three weeks ago a mutual friend has told O That he has romantic feelings for me. Since this occurrence O has made it his mission to mention this mutual friend every chance he gets. 

O thinks I should go out with him, but O already knows I have never had any interest in dating and that this mutual friend liking me hasn’t changed those interests. O tells me that it is because I am deeply insecure and tells me that I am quote “wasting my life” due to my reluctance to date and my inexperience in dating. It rubs me the wrong way that he is making such broad statements, So I tell him to stop mentioning our mutual friend all together but he doesn’t.  He keeps hounding me to go out with him and It takes only a few days until I’m sick of O’s antics

I don’t yell or raise my voice but I do tell him quote “that he thinks he is helping me by giving me constant advice but he isn’t” I also told him “that he is a bug that goes prying into peoples business because he has no business of his own”. It’s at this point that he finally leaves me alone. 

Now, I didn’t think that this insult affected O at all until he brings it in conversation a few days later. He says a bunch of things first he says that I acted irrational by lashing out at him, and that I am not only emotional but that I am also more emotional than him as well. 

I realize that what I said hurt his feelings, so I apologize to him.

Though I do regret lashing out, I also however still think that me lashing out was somewhat justified. (He kept bringing up a topic. I tell him to stop being up said topic. He keeps bringing up topic anyway.) He doesn’t thinks he is wrong in any part of this. And keeps bringing the fact that I lashed out on him to other people around. 

I ask him if he can stop mentioning me lashing out at him to other people he simply tells me something along the lines of “when someone does something bad it should be mentioned,”
I laugh a little when he says this and I tell him that I think that he’s not only arrogant but dramatic as well which annoys him. He says I’m immature. I disagree. He also calls me an asshole which makes me think of this subreddit and why I am here now. 

I know that I could easily be in the wrong due to my young age and lack of knowledge concerning interpersonal relationships. I am still learning and I think I can learn more by asking for the opinion of others.

10,1f4dfi4,AITA for telling others about my harassment?,"I, \[15F\], have faced some kind of harassment(?) from a boy in my year, also 15. It started in year 7, where we liked each other, but he soon started being nasty to me. Let's call him Alan, fake name.

in year 8, he told me he liked me. I have never been interested. I told him this.

and in year 9, this is where it got really bad. He'd hold stuff above my head, but also make unwanted sexual advances? To name a few examples I discussed with others, one time he purposely moved me by grabbing my waist. I know it was on purpose because he went to do it, I moved, and he did it anyway to move me back to that spot? Also, one time, I was putting some items in my bag, and he told me ""I was the perfect height on my knees"". Again..I didn't express interest in him; in fact, I just wanted to be friends.

one day, in an English lesson, he'd been grabbing my thigh. I told him to stop, and, to my face, he said ""please, just 5 seconds."" His reasoning? If he manages to get me to allow it for long enough, he's sure I'll like it. He's also told me he loves me in multiple occasions, which I did not reciprocate both times. Also, we hung out once and he tried to hold my hands and stuff. I said no as if just got out of a terrible relationship with a boy who treated me very badly, and he got angry at me, saying ""wow you really think I would do that?"" Before losing all interest.

now, I'm year 10, I started talking about it, as I'd heard other girls in my year talking about how Alan had harassed them. I told one of my friends at the time, but he told the schools biggest instigator.

and then the popular, you know, rude lads every school has, started harassing me. They asked me if it was true, ""did he grab your thigh?"", did he say ""five seconds"", ect. I assumed if they knew, most everyone would have known.

so when some girls in my science were talking about how Alan treats his girlfriend, I spoke up about what I'd dealt with, (he's done way shittier things but that's a rabbit hole). Apparently not everyone knew, because it got to his girlfriend, who said.. ""shes probably lying anyway."" This really upset me, because I felt invalidated. But also, me and Alan had become friends kind of now he had a girlfriend, and I felt bad she'd heard. But then they both got angry at me, for 'spreading crazy rumours' and stuff, and now I'm questioning if I was right, since he'd been okay to me a few months before all of this came out. I really hope I didn't ruin a guy's social life for no reason.

INFO/EDIT: I have told my parents, but am reluctant to get the school involved as I have no physical proof, and they don't do anything except maybe a notice in assembly no one listens to without proof. i think you should also know that more girls have been sharing there experiences now, too, with the year group. He's talked to a lot of them, because he's a bit of an 'alpha male, I listen to andrew tate kind of guy. He even tried to start a marketing business, and used that to chat up girls too, like my friend (15F), Hannah(fake name) who told him she had no interest in dating and wanted to focus on careers.

12,1f4d4he,WIBTA if I got my half-brother a birthday gift even though my dad disowned me?,"Second time posting because I originally posted it to my account by accident.

I(16) am a queer kid that came out in June of this year, which resulted in my dad(42M) ghosting and essentially disowning me. Before I get into the bread and butter of my reason for posting, I’d like to give some background. I have 2 siblings (12M & 10F), 2 step-siblings (18F and 14M), and 1 half-brother who is turning 2 years old this October. I am AFAB, but never really an effeminate child.

I have been out as queer for 3~4 years to pretty much anyone but my dad and his wife, whom we will call “Beth”.

Beth and my dad got together around about 4~5 years ago when I was about 11, maybe 12. I have never resented Beth, in fact, I really liked her. When I was just becoming a teenager, I craved validation and attention from my parents, including Beth. I was never a perfect kid, but I wasn’t a bad one and Beth never seemed to hate me. I’ve had a generally rocky relationship with my dad since I was a freshman in high school. I have short hair and my dad never liked it because it isn’t feminine. I remained in the closet for a few years, even having my at the time partner over at my dad on several occasions as my mother’s home was very small and cramped in comparison, so it was easier to invite her to my dad’s. When I came out during finals week this year, my dad completely ghosted me and seemed to have told his mother as she was shittalking me to anyone who would listen. I am in contact with my dad’s brother, who was ostracized from my dad’s family because his spouse is queer as well. My uncle and my aunt are very liberal and supportive.

My half-brother, who we’ll call “Jojo,” was born two years ago come October, the same month as mine and my father’s birthdays. Jojo is an adorable little brother that loves the children’s show, Bluey, so I was thinking of getting him something from or of it. While shopping, I started to think about how I would get it to Jojo. My younger siblings still go over to my dad’s as my parents have non-court mandated shared custody and they choose to go over, which I do not blame them for, they are little. I was considering sending my gift with my younger sister, but I don’t want her to get yelled at as my dad is mean enough to her.

I was considering sending my dad a formally written text or email asking for permission to send Jojo a birthday present, but I don’t want to call him “Dad,” because I feel he doesn’t deserve it. It’s a little petty, but I just don’t want to call the man that effectively ghosted his 16 year old because he doesn’t like that I’m not a prim and proper cisgender woman at 16.

13,1f4d3ni,AITA For wanting dishes to be cleaned correctly when it’s not my turn to do them? ,"
I (23m) am training for my IT traveling support position at home and I wanted to use my skillet to make eggs. I get in the kitchen and my roommate (24f) had apparently put like water just ran over dishes into the dishwasher, and left the rest for me in the sink, assumed as such due to our flip flop of dishwashing deal. I hoped that she maybe wasn’t done and go about my business, cleaning as I go as usual, except for the skillet because the food is generally served in the skillet. 

I leave half for her because it was very good and I knew she was coming home from classes around one, I text her, she says she’s almost home, I take that as about ten minutes away. My lunch is almost up so I text her I left it out since I have to get back to training videos, she says ok. She gets home an hour later, microwaves her SCRAMBLED AGGS AND SAUSAGE tells me “yeah it’s OK” and then asks me when I have time to clean the kitchen. I’m fed up and say I gotta get back to working. 

Five minutes later I need water because my throats dry and kinda wanna show her how bad she left the kitchen, open the dishwasher and go “Ew did you do the dishes?” She says “oh I didn’t run the dishwasher” I try to tell her that we don’t have a good dishwasher and they won’t clean like that and she acts like I have a third eye and says she rinsed them off and says I’m always being an asshole about how she does dishes and that it’s called a dish “washer” so why does it not wash dishes I told her I’m not fighting about this again (I’ve tried explaining this to her WITH FRIENDS and she still refuses to understand) and leave with a red solo cup of water. 

Aita???? I know I’m being very biased rn because I’m still a bit heated but in what world does someone think a US dishwasher that’s probably older than both of us is going to genuinely clean clean dishes? Like why can’t she at least get the visible food off the dishes? I KNOW she doesn’t have her glasses on when she does the dishes so like is it her not seeing correctly?? There’s so much food on these dishes though it genuinely looks like she just ate the Mac n cheese out of one of the bowls like two days ago and didn’t touch it (I don’t generally buy Mac n cheese as I’m lactose intolerant). Also I have until the beginning of October until the end of the lease so I’m not too pressed about fighting about this again but honestly at this point it’s a point that idk how it’s not getting through to her at.

14,1f4cwpk,WIBTA for telling my dad I won't pay for his bad habits?,"My (32f) dad(51m) has been paralyzed from the waist down since a few months before I was born. He has always lived on his own and been fairly independent for the most part until the last few years, when he became depressed after one of his legs needed to be amputated, crushing his dream of being able to walk again and has just let himself go, he stopped working, getting up etc.

I live on the other side of the country and today one of his aides text me telling me he needs more money as he has been running out every month. I have been sending money when I can but now it's up to 200$ a month. I know that my dad is on a fixed income but he is spending a lot of money on cigarettes and door dash and credit card bills and running out of money every month because of it.

It's difficult enough for me to manage my own household while looking for work and I don't mind scraping together what I do have and sending money for groceries and cleaning supplies etc but I don't want to fund his cigarette and door dash habit, he goes through a few bags of sugar a month on coffee alone. He lives in California and does not want to leave his apartment and being near other family that live close by despite it being completely unsustainable for any quality of life. (tiny, cramped, hoarder style space)

I would move closer, but I simply cannot afford to live in CA. I don't want to tell him what he can and cannot spend the money I give him on but I am cutting into my own life and savings while not working and trying to get my own business and life off the ground.

WIBTA if I told my dad that I don't feel comfortable paying for things i.e: cigarettes, sugar, fast food that aren't life affirming?",No A-holes here,2024-08-29,"WIBTA for telling my dad I won't pay for his bad habits? My (32f) dad(51m) has been paralyzed from the waist down since a few months before I was born. He has always lived on his own and been fairly independent for the most part until the last few years, when he became depressed after one of his legs needed to be amputated, crushing his dream of being able to walk again and has just let himself go, he stopped working, getting up etc.

I live on the other side of the country and today one of his aides text me telling me he needs more money as he has been running out every month. I have been sending money when I can but now it's up to 200$ a month. I know that my dad is on a fixed income but he is spending a lot of money on cigarettes and door dash and credit card bills and running out of money every month because of it.

It's difficult enough for me to manage my own household while looking for work and I don't mind scraping together what I do have and sending money for groceries and cleaning supplies etc but I don't want to fund his cigarette and door dash habit, he goes through a few bags of sugar a month on coffee alone. He lives in California and does not want to leave his apartment and being near other family that live close by despite it being completely unsustainable for any quality of life. (tiny, cramped, hoarder style space)

I would move closer, but I simply cannot afford to live in CA. I don't want to tell him what he can and cannot spend the money I give him on but I am cutting into my own life and savings while not working and trying to get my own business and life off the ground. At this rate, I will never have kids because of how much of my own life gets put on hold saving my family.

She bitched to my daughter and now my daughter is mad at me again.

Probably since my daughter wasn't there to play to for sympathy. I called her out on it and started calling out all her leech behavior and she made a snarky comment and walked away.

She bitched to my daughter and now my daughter is mad at me again.

Edit: They are not married. They don't even share a bedroom. This isn't a case of ""mom is too dumb to know they are a couple""

Edit because everyone is MISSING THE POINT. Leech is obviously faking whatever is wrong with her and taking advantage of my daughter for a long time. She did not cut me off until the leech told her too. Probably played up the issues then too. ",1.0,1.0586570501327517,1,1

24,1f4c6ms,AITAH for changing my hair color,"AITA for not wanting to share everything with my friend?

Throw away. I (23f) and my best friend (29f) have been friends for about three or four years now. And it's a really good friendship that I really enjoy. For starters I am a sibling of nine and I really enjoy my individuality since I never really had it growing up. But I've noticed that a lot of the things I do as far as hobbies or enjoying things, she picks them up as well and it's starting to feel as if I'm being copied and I don't like it. She had her own hobbies and interests before moving in. 

Suddenly it seems like any song I play, ends up on her Playlist despite it not being at all her style which, fine, I never said anything, we enjoyed music together and that's fine. I'm also a writer and artist who has taken a break from the creatives to pursue other hobbies and not grt burnt out. So when I mentioned I would be resuming my novel, suddenly, without ever having done it before, she wants to write. It sort of rubbed me the wrong way but I've stayed silent. I don't want to crush anyone's creative spirit but the timing to be right after I decide to pursue my novel again, seemed like it was a direct copycat. 

Some months later I've been drawing heavily and improving my art. I was sitting in the common area and drawing when she expressed an interest in drawing (again never having done it before this as she said 'stick figures are the best I can do') and wanted to know all the things I used and did, and it sort of turned me off from drawing. Low and behold despite her sudden vigor interest in these things I used to do all the time, the moment I stopped doing them, so has she. She has never even finished her first drawing and she also never finished a first chapter in a story. 

This brings me to today. I know I do not own a hair color. I've done my hair green for seven years now. It's always been my favorite. Before I have stressed to her I don't like matching. So today when she told me her plan was to go green, I kind of shut up and got mildly sour as it seems all the things I like to do, despite never having done it before, she's latching onto and it's turning me off from the friendship. I've already bought black hair dye and I'm not going to fight this issue. I'm just going to quietly dye it later. 

Another example would be a game I love playing that I've been playing for about 3 years now and I would always try to get her to play co op with me but she always made a face and said no because it's the opposite of the games she likes. She hated simulation games and that was fine. But the day she watched me play it with someone else and have fun, suddenly she wanted to play it with me despite the 5 times I've already asked and been rejected. P.s. she looked miserable the entire time we played so I didn't play with her again. 

I also want to add that it's not that we don't have anything in common. I feel really silly feeling like this and need to know if I'm being an asshole by feeling this way?

25,1f4c52w,AITA for refusing to pay my half of a loan I took together with my husband?,"
My husband and I purchased a parcel of land suitable for a one-family home, a bigger house and a guest house or several smaller bungalows to rent out to tourists. Since it's in a quite prominent location (we're located in Central Europe, the parcel is in a Baltic Sea resort), it was pretty expensive, we spent both our savings and took a loan for it together. The idea was to place our money somewhere, where raging inflation wouldn't harm it with loose thoughts on maybe building a vacation house for ourselves plus as a kind of Airbnb situation for tourists, when we wouldn't use it ourselves.

We recently had a child and my husband started pushing on building a house for our family there. We live in neighbouring country and the land is in our country of origin. We don't have clear plans as to where we are going to live in a couple of years when our son is supposed to go to school, but we'd rather not stay exactly where we are right now. With our jobs it would be possible to move within the country we live in right now, coming back to our country of origin would be a leap of faith to say at the least. But we would be closer to both our families, who live there permanently. Also so many other pros and cons due to political situation and our not always matching preferences.

Now, as I mentioned we recently had a baby (9 mo) and I'm staying at home with the baby. I'm on paid maternity leave, which is paid by the state. It's a complicated system, so let me just say that there is a fixed amount of money you can be paid (depending on your income) and how much you get a month depends on how long you declared to stay home with the child. We decided that I'll stay as long as possible, which adds up to 1,5 years outside of my regular job. At the beginning I got a bit more state money, around 50% of my usual earnings, now and for the next months it's gonna be about 25% of my usual income.

This happens to be approximately the the same amount of money that my part of the monthly loan payment would be. Also I still have to pay my half of other bills, rent, cost of living and baby stuff. In order to be able to pay for it I would have to tap into my savings for the next 4 months and I don't think it's fair. My reasoning is that I gave up my regular salary, ability to buy whatever I want, going to restaurants, etc, ability to save money and basically my financial independence to raise our child and should not be forced to use my contingency money.

My husband is working full time and his earnings didn't change. He thinks I should pay my half as per usual since he wants to keep saving up for the house.

When my boss went on holiday I was basically running the shop. There was no problem really everything went well. Ok so the first thing i think i fucked up was that i kept 2 tips customers gave me. It was only 60 cents so nothing much, but imagine there is a camera and she saw me putting money in my wallet. The 2nd thing i fucked up was actually bringing my friend. I have a friend Lorry (fake name), we are childhood best friends, but lately we grew apart. We are just 2 souls who grew up to be different people. We stayed friends and heard me out ok i love her, but after telling her many times she cant be with me at work she never listened and i couldn't just kick her out. Our town is small so people could gossip and it could get to my boss. And also when I was closing up and cleaning she offered to help me mop the floor. It was one of the mops that spin in a bucket. After a while she started complaining about it not working and said that she is not going to mop because it is impossible. That's fine, I was planning on doing it myself anyway. And yes the mop was shitty as fuck. Today I got paid. My boss deducted 15 euros from my pay check for breaking the mop.

32,1f4bgkw,"AITA For telling my sister-in-law that her ""side hustle"" makes her a bad person","My brother (33M) and his wife (30F) have 2 young boys (3 & 1).  My wife and I have a 5-year-old son so over the years we have given them quite a few items that we no longer used/needed.  Crib, clothes, toys, various baby items, etc.  Most of the things were just taking up space in our house and we knew they would put them to use so we had no problem giving them away.  

We visited them a couple weeks ago for their 3-year-old's birthday party.  During the party, SIL mentioned that she has been selling off a bunch of baby stuff as a ""side hustle.""  Both she and my brother are the youngest of their families and she said that they get so many hand-me-downs from their siblings that they couldn't keep track of them all.

Her solution was to start selling these gifts off online to make a few extra bucks.  She was basically bragging about it.  I told her that is a pretty crappy thing to do considering that these items were given to them as gifts that they willingly accepted and were expected to use.  I asked her if they had sold some of the things we have given them and she laughed and said that she was sure she did because we've given them a lot of stuff.  

I told her that if I had known she was going to sell those items off, I would have given them away to someone else or donated them to a local non-profit that helps young mothers in need.  She got defensive and told me that it's not like she's making a lot of money off these things, just a few bucks here and there.  I told her that the people buying those items are probably the same people who would benefit from getting them for free and that she's taking advantage of them.  

She went off about how hard things are with the economy right now and how they need all the help they can get financially.  Mind you, both she and my brother have college degrees and work full-time.  I know raising kids is expensive, but they aren't in dire straits.  

I told her that she probably shouldn't expect us to give them anything else in the future and I would probably suggest to my other siblings that they refrain from doing so as well and look into other options for donating things.  She got defensive again and told me that she doesn't feel like she's doing anything wrong.  

I told her she's entitled to feel that way, but my opinion of her as a person is now lesser because of this.  She said that selling things they don't use to make a few bucks doesn't make her a bad person and I told her that considering they were given these things for free, it kind of does.

We spent years getting into arguments over my lack of desire to be involved with his church community and I was threatened with homelessness and verbally abused for it for as long as i can remember. It got continuously worse as i grew older because he has a terrible temper and we clashed often. Things got worse when he decided that God wanted him to be a pastor and he enrolled in school to become ordained.

35,1f4bcs9,AITA for setting boundaries during wedding planning?,"Over the last year, there has been more and more tension with my mother, and by extension my father as well. I think they view this as me listening to everything my fiancée tells me to do. My mom thinks I have turned “rude” and “selfish” and I know she is talking about me behind my back to my friends and family. They haven’t really celebrated our engagement beyond saying “ we are happy for you.” Now, with planning a wedding, the tension has stepped up a notch. 

2 weekends ago I had to begin the conversation on if they wanted to contribute anything to the wedding as a gift. They said they were interested in doing so and we asked if there would be any expectations that go along with that. My mom brought up inviting her friends. My fiancée and I discussed it and we don't really want people that aren't important to us to be there. However, a lot of the people on our ""big list"" ARE family friends. 

No one was bringing it up in my conversation I had with them last weekend, so I asked again if they had discussed it. We got the same answer but this time it seemed more like a non-negotiable. My dad was trying to frame it as ""this should be a good thing that we are celebrating adding my fiancée to our family and that this is a family event so there are people that want to celebrate with you"" I responded that it's not what is happening. 



I said that my fiancée and I are creating a new family and our families are blending, and the day is about her and I and not them. We aren't sure we should even share the list we have right now because it isn't their decision. Of course we are pretty upset that they are trying to frame it like this. At this point we are thinking we might do something a lot smaller than originally planned with just immediate family and close friends and completely self fund it, except the scholarship donors that put my fiancée through undergraduate are generously gifting us the funds for a photographer and possibly letting us use their beautiful house as a venue. Last night I was helping my dad with something on my moms computer and i overheard my parents talking about how i used to pull up FaceTime on the computer so i could see them and my dad responded ""but now (fiancées name) says I shouldn't want to see my mom, or look at her"" because they didn't realize their mic was on. I am feeling very hurt and conflicted by this whole thing. 

My relationship with my parents was stable before my fiancée came into the picture, but looking back was it just because I agreed with what they did and said because I was passive? Am I the asshole for setting these boundaries? 





TL;DR: Over the past year, tension has escalated between me and my parents, especially as they perceive my fiancée as the driving force behind my decisions, leading to them accusing her and I of being ""rude"" and ""selfish.""

36,1f4az7u,"AITAH for not wanting to do my MIL’s entire bridal party’s makeup, FOR FREE (without being asked, just being volunTOLD? ","First time posting on this subreddit, I apologize if the story is all over the place, it’s been forever since I’ve tried to write something other than a text message 😂 
I should give a little bit of context, I (24f) have been with my boyfriend (28m) for almost 5 years. We just recently found out we were expecting our first child, and we are super excited. It is a high risk pregnancy though due to some medical conditions that I deal with. 
My MIL, let’s call her Edith, is getting married in less than a week. 
I remember months ago her mentioning to me “I would love for you to do my makeup for the wedding.” Which I didn’t have a problem with at all, but I never did agree to it. I never once said “yes, I will do it.” Let’s just say that she’s the type of person to just assume or expect someone will do something without ever even asking them, she’s done this on more than one occasion. I HATE being volunteered or  “volunTOLD” to do something. Especially now that I’m pregnant and hormonal af. 
Let’s just say I would’ve been okay with her expecting me to do HER makeup. But now all of a sudden, she’s telling her entire bridal party that I OFFERED to do EVERYONE’S makeup, for FREE, for the wedding… 
1) I wasn’t even asked, not once. 
2)I did NOT OFFER
3) I never agreed to do EVERYBODY’S makeup that day, I did agree to do Edith’s after she assumed I would, I did not agree to do everyone else’s. 
4) With my pregnancy being high risk, I do not want to stand there for hours on end doing people’s makeup, as much as I do enjoy doing makeup, it’s the principle of never being asked, just expected. And for free? Like I understand helping family out, but I think my time is worth something at least. Sometimes to do one person, it can take me over an hour, multiplying that by 7 or 8.. NO THANK YOU. I’ll be there all day doing makeup 😔

So, am I the asshole for not wanting to do this? I don’t mind doing hers and only hers, but to be quite honest I do not want to stand there all day doing everyone else’s makeup when the bride’s is the most important. I’m not the type that does well with confrontation, so I doubt I will say anything at all about it. I wouldn’t even know what to say other than “I never agreed to do everyone’s makeup, and you never even asked me. You just assumed I would do it, and it bothers me that you’re telling everyone I offered to do their makeup when that’s not the case. I don’t want to look like the ass when I tell them I never agreed to do everyone’s and I most likely won’t have time to finish all of the makeup before the wedding.” I’m just not very happy about it.

I told her then that I don’t like doing this and that she can set up a timer on her phone, pose, and look herself. She didn’t really listen and brushed me off.

“Can you just look” Me: “No Mom set up your phone so-“ My mom: “When I’m selfish like you, you aren’t gonna like it.” Then she stormed off and slammed the door to her room. So I forced opened her door (yeah I know I was wrong in this) and said, “Stop with the manipulation, you can use your phone-“ Then she slammed the door in my face again. I just went back to my room and here I am writing this. So, AITA?

Not too long ago, my mom came into my room and started to pull down her underwear so I could look at something, I stopped her. For context, she did this and made me look at a bloody chunk of white meat that got exposed after she was scratching it off just a couple of days ago, probably 5 or 6, and I’m still getting over that. I told her then that I don’t like doing this and that she can set up a timer on her phone, pose, and look herself. She didn’t really listen and brushed me off. Fast forward to today, I stop her midway so I all see is her crack and I’m like 
“🖐🏾 No I don’t wanna see that” My mom: 
“Can you just look” Me: “No Mom set up your phone so-“ My mom: “When I’m selfish like you, you aren’t gonna like it.” Then she stormed off and slammed the door to her room. So I forced opened her door (yeah I know I was wrong in this) and said, “Stop with the manipulation, you can use your phone-“ Then she slammed the door in my face again.

39,1f4a9e2,AITA for meal prepping ,"My (F,21) mum (F,60) keeps getting rid of food that I buy or cook because she hates having food in the fridge. It’s driving me crazy and I’m starting to think i’m losing my mind. 
I started meal prepping a few years ago and will often keep up to a week of fresh-made meals in the fridge. As i go to the gym, my meals will often consist of a lot of healthy proteins, carbs and a form of veg. This means that there is often a lot of cooked meats, carbs such as pasta or rice, and fresh vegetables as i love making a salad to go with my meals or as a snack. I also prioritise healthy snacking so i only keep easy fresh snacks in the house such as fruit.

My mum tends to make all her meals fresh and will make enough for the day, the only food she will leave in the fridge is random leftovers that weren’t cooked, so for example, you would find; a few table spoons of chopped tomatoes, some cooked spinach and butter and nothing else. My mum will often expect me to be able to make a meal out of this, which is why i buy and cook more food so that days like this don’t happen. I hate having to buy my ingredients every time i cook as i have to plan my meals that way too. 

As a student and now a working professional, meal prepping really works for me. it eliminates so much time from my day and it helps me keep my meals healthy as i avoid buying fast food out of laziness. 

Now where the issue comes in:

I recently moved back home and have continued meal prepping. way too many times to count, i will come home to all of my meals from that day having been eaten, given away or thrown away. When i ask my mum about it, she says that she can’t stand having food in the fridge so she eats it all to get rid of it. 
I’ve asked her so many times to stop doing this, as i make enough food to last a week, which can get expensive as this could be up to £15 worth of protein a week. She also keeps complaining about gaining weight but doesn’t seem to understand that eating thousands of calories to have an empty fridge is not helping. 

I argued that the purpose of the fridge is to be able to keep food for longer periods of time, not to stay empty and only hold random food items. 
Now that I am an adult, i realise how many habits of ours are just so unhealthy, in my teenage years, i used to be nauseas all the time, especially when i woke up, only to realise that it was because i wasn’t eating enough at all, and when i would eat it would be odd items that i would find in the fridge. I thought the nausea was normal for me but only as i have started eating regularly have i noticed that this way of life is not normal. 

Now whenever i buy food in advance to make for the week, she argues with me about buying food and complains so much that it is literally driving me crazy. 

AITA for buying food and meal prepping all the time?

41,1f49wb6,AITAH for telling a friend to text me less,"
I met a new online friend like a week ago in a random voice chat. I was just being polite and stuff and added him as a friend. 

However he has been texting me every day multiple times since then asking me to talk to him and what I’m doing. I just feel chased and like I can’t rest. Sometimes I wait a couple hours before I reply but then he always replies immediately and wants to talk even though I feel too tired. 

He has been making me gifts and poems about how nice and amazing I am. And that I’m the first person in his life to ever be so amazing. (I’m just normal niceness). It makes me feel like I wanna be a friend for him but his constant texting is really draining and then I feel so bad for not replying. 

He keeps talking about how we are such great friends and how he wants to visit where I live but I just feel like it all too much from an online friend I met a week ago. 

I understand his need for friendship and have tried suggesting him to befriend other people but he says that I’m all he needs and refuses. 

I just wanna talk to him maybe once a week or so privately cuz I already have a friends I do group vcs with but he never wants to join and says he will wait until I’m leaving the vc and then he wants to talk. 

He acts like we have been best friends for years and is just way too intense with all the gifts he wants to give me and that he wants to visit where I live and talk all the time. 

We have been friends for a week. I feel like it would be mean of me to say that I want him to text me less   But I don’t know what to do. I just feel so chased and like I’m not allowed to rest while he’s being so overly familiar with me.

42,1f49obl,AITA for not making a trip to the bank to get change for $100?,"I  have a friend who is paranoid about using her credit card online. She works close to where I live, so when she asked me if I could grab some stuff for her online, she’ll pay me back, I agreed.

This happened around ten times over the last four months, but she always paid me back in paper bills, and expected me to have change ready for her. Like, if she owes me $72.32, she’ll tell me she’s bringing $80 and expect I have change. OK, whatever, I do have $8.

I don’t use cash for anything anymore, so half the reason I kept cash on hand was so that I’d have change for her.  But she hasn’t asked me to buy anything for over a month now, and I kind of lost the habit.

This time, when she said, *I’ll bring you $100 on Friday* (item was $68), I told her I didn’t have change. I asked if she could do a e-transfer (she asked me to e-transfer $12.50 for something I bought from her, 3 weeks ago) or to give me $70 and I’ll have $2 for her.

She replied saying she used up her other bills, she only has $100. …So what about e-transfer, I tell her it’ll be easier that way. She reacts with a 😡 (??) and says in person would be safer. I try to tell her e-transfers are very safe, *copy/paste my email if you’re afraid of typos*, but she tells me a few minutes later to “Never ever use e-transfer”. OK? So what was that 3 weeks ago then?

At this point, I’m a bit annoyed.  I message her that I really don’t have that much cash, I use my phone & credit card for everything. And, *I’m not a taxi driver haha, you can’t expect me to have exact change for you every time 🤣 /  Plus, there’s no rush, you can give me the money whenever you have it ready next week*


She read the messages. And left me on read.

Two hours later, I can’t take the silence, and I’m thinking I might have been too harsh. I message her again, *okay, it’s fine this time, I’ll go to the bank to get change for you. / But next time, can you try to have the exact amount ready before you ask me buy something? / I’m not a store, I really don’t think it’s my responsibility to have the exact change for you every single time, right…?  / I think e-transfer is an efficient compromise, and it worked out last time, but if you don’t trust it, that’s okay too…. / But I really don’t think I need to be making extra trips to the bank because of that, and just because neither of us has change for an item that you bought…. / Like it’s fine this time, it’s also my fault for letting it be this way for so long.*

She reads the messages almost immediately but leaves me on read again. Whatever, it’s late now.

I wrote this AITA last night, but I wasn’t planning to post it.  But I woke up to her blocking me on messenger and Facebook this morning.

AITA here? I guess a 10-15 min trip to the bank isn’t a big deal in hindsight. Should I just have gotten change for her without saying anything, because it’s always been that way anyways? What should I do now?

Edit:  Thank you to everyone who responded! You guys are all too kind, and you’re right, I need to stop helping her buy stuff, especially if she continues to treat me like a cashier with a register on hand.

43,1f49kjq,AITA for not letting my mother's youngest kid/her stepkid come when my sister visits me?,"This is going to be a mess so I'll get background out of the way now.

My mom has always been a mess. When I was 4 she told the man she was married to but separated from, who believed he was my dad, that he wasn't, and a DNA proved mom was telling the truth. They'd been separated for 3 years at that point and he stopped fighting to see me to get the divorce and I never saw him again. My mom has no idea who my actual father is. She said there are so many potential fathers for me.

When I was 6 my mom got pregnant and had my (half) sister Emmy (16). Emmy and I grew up close because of how much of a mess mom was. Mom's on and off husband of the last 14 years is Adam and he's a dick. He and mom never divorced but they have separated three different times since they got married (after only a month of knowing each other). And there are times they have smaller breakups too. But I lost count of those. Adam and I had a toxic relationship and we butted heads a lot. My mom always put Adam before me and Emmy and as a result I had no respect for her. But she also gave us a shitty childhood. We rarely had what we needed, she and Adam would fight a lot and she'd stay even when all the fighting made Emmy cry. I asked her to leave Adam when I was 12 and focus on me and Emmy and she told me that she would never let us break them up. She told me he was too important.

When I was 16 I was taken into foster care but Emmy was kept at home. I stayed in foster care until I turned 18. I kept in touch with Emmy as much as I could and I ended up not doing college and instead focusing on a trade so I could get stable and help Emmy as much as possible, but I was never going to be able to get custody and I did try but was refused. 

So since I left mom and Adam broke up again and Adam had a daughter with someone else who he and mom are now raising together. I think she's 5. Or something like that.

I'm extremely low contact with mom. I only don't block her in case she stops Emmy from seeing me at all. But now she wants me to take her stepkid who she calls her daughter. She told me I should spend time with both of my ""siblings"". I replied that I have one sibling; Emmy. She told me I shouldn't take our issues out on her youngest and I could easily have them both over for a movie or a pizza night like I do with Emmy. She's putting pressure on Emmy to take the kid with her when she visits me. I told mom it won't be happening and that younger child has nothing to do with me. And I want to clarify that I have never met the kid.

My mom said she will do more to stop Emmy seeing me if I don't agree. Emmy told me we can figure it out. She doesn't always know when she's with me. Mom also told me I should be a hero to both the girls.

44,1f49c3q,AITA for recovering a car I was paying for that I could no longer afford?,"In 2020 I purchased two cars. One for me and one for my mother. My financial and personal circumstances were different. I was not yet a mother and interest rates were lower. However, I became a mom and cost of living got more expensive and I could no longer afford both cars.

I explained this to my mother and asked if I could use the car for e-hailing and other deliveries. At least that would help with the repayments.

45,1f49aiw,AITA for being slow in the shower at my vacation?,"Me (16NB), my sister (28F) and my mother (45F) Went on vacation in Greece, it was going completely fine until the last day where i stayed in the shower for a bit too long, the reason as to why i knew is because my when i was still busy, my sister started yelling at me about how i should get out and that this is the reason as to why she has never liked me and is never bringing me on vacation again, the reason as to why she was so angry is because we wanted to go to the beach and me not getting out of the shower caused us to be late by around 15-ish minutes. 

While we were riding to the place by car i started thinking about the things she said to me, the fact that she never liked me as her sibling and everything else basically, which started to make me tear up and even cry a little in the car.

My mother noticed and decided to scold her for being crude towards me and taking it too far, but i stopped my mother and told her it wasn’t her fault that i messed up.

We arrived there around 9:30 and we proceeded to take our seats and pretty much do beach things until i decided to apologise to her about being so slow, but when i tried to tell her i was sorry she cut me off and told me she was used to this from me.

Later, when we went to a restaurant i tried bringing this up again to her and thanking her for everything she did (she basically took care of the entire four-day vacation, she brang us everywhere, scheduled everything etc.) because i was honestly very grateful for the fact that she would go through all this trouble just for us. She told me that the only person in her life is her from now on and that i shouldn’t bother her about it anymore.

AITA? I feel like the entire thing wouldn’t of have happened if i didn’t take so much time in the shower, causing it to ultimately be my fault.

46,1f48t7k,AITA for telling my step mother to fuck off when she criticised my brother for commenting on my weight?,"I’m 17F and my big brother is 23M. Step mother Abby moved in only 6 months ago.

About 2 years ago I got into an obsession with my weight, and ended up losing all the way to bmi of 18. It wasn’t good at all, I didn’t look nice or healthy and I wasn’t feeling great either. I worked with my family and therapist to get over the obsession, and increased my weight to bmi of 22 including increasing some lean weight as well. This has been a very good change for me, I look better and feel better, and my doctor told me I am healthier too.

I’m doing an intense summer internship right now and haven’t been eating as much as I should in the last few weeks. My bmi has gone down to just under 21 now. This last weekend I was going to the beach with my family and my brother who hadn’t seen me in a bikini in a while mentioned (when we were alone) that I’ve definitely lost weight and he was worried. I assured him I hadn’t gone back to trying to lose weight, and this was mostly due to being busy and promised that I wouldn’t let this go any further and will make changes to eat enough and properly.

What I didn’t know was that my step mother was eavesdropping this conversation. A day later she came to me and said she was “concerned” that my brother commented on my weight, saying it’s never okay for a man to comment on woman’s weight, no matter if they’re family. She said my brother crossed a line and I should not have explained anything or made any promises.

I was taken aback by all of this, more than anything that she had eavesdropped on a private conversation, so I told her that I didn’t like what she did and said it is her who needs to apologise to me, not my brother! And my brother was also only concerned because of a real and serious problem that I struggled with, so I think he was justified to be concerned when he noticed I had lost weight.

She tried to justify her actions by saying she was concerned my brother was bullying me for my weight, and I was being too submissive by listening to him, when this obviously was not the case at all. So I got angry and told her she’s insane and to fuck off. Now she’s gone to my dad, and while dad agrees brother and I did nothing wrong initially, he said disrespecting step mom was wrong and I should apologise. I’ve so far refused, it’s her who owes us an apology for eavesdropping. Since then we’re not on speaking terms and it’s caused serious tension at home. I’m not backing down.

47,1f48koz,AITAH for asking my boyfriend that I need 2 to 3 days with him out of the week with no computer? ," I’ve been with my boyfriend for three years, and we’ve lived together for one. We used to spend a lot of time together before moving in, but after moving in, the planning stopped. For the past 5-6 months, I’ve been asking him to make plans, but it’s been an ongoing struggle. Despite having multiple conversations, the effort fades after a week. Now, I almost have to beg him to spend time with me. He plays video games nonstop, seven days a week, and doesn’t do anything else. Even if he plays all week, he complains if there’s one day he doesn’t get to play.

I used to ask him to do things with me, but the constant rejection led me to give up. Even when we try to hang out at home, he suddenly disappears, only for me to find him on his computer. When I confronted him about it, he’d say things like, “Oh, I just had to finish up one thing,” or claim he didn’t know I wanted him to stay the whole time.

This all came to a head yesterday when I broke down. I asked him to sit down, and I told him, “I love you, but we barely spend any time together, and I’m starting to feel concerned that you spend too much time on your computer. It feels like I’m competing with the games. Even when we go out, it feels like we’re rushing home so you can play. I think it would be nice for you to set aside 2 to 3 days with no computer so we can spend time together without distractions.”

He just said, “OK,” but I could tell he wasn’t really listening. When I asked if he understood what I was asking, he replied, “Yes, you want me to spend more time with you.” I clarified, saying, “Yes, but the main point is that I think there should be days where you aren’t on the computer so I can have your undivided attention.”

At this point, he started yelling, “No! Stop trying to fucking control me!” He accused me of adding demands and trying to take away the one thing he enjoys, saying he needs it every day to de-stress. When I asked why he couldn’t do this for me, he said it was unreasonable. He also claimed that we’ve been spending more time together, but when I pointed out that it’s still not enough, he said, “It isn’t gonna happen all at once,” which really hurt because it felt like he doesn’t prioritize our relationship.

I told him, “Please stop yelling at me. I can’t talk to you or listen to what you’re saying when you yell at me,” and he responded, “I’m gonna yell if I fucking want to, and you are going to listen to me!” I told him through tears that when he treats me like this, it doesn’t feel like he loves me. His response was a nonchalant, “Well, you figure it out.”

Finally, I said I was leaving. He went back to his room, slammed the door, and hit something, calling me a bitch multiple times. Now, I’m second-guessing myself, wondering if it’s too much to ask him to go two or three days without playing on his computer and if I’m being too harsh.

48,1f489xt,AITA for making my brother return the birthday present he bought me?,"I'm a minor in high school and he is an adult in college while maintaining a job for the past few years. In my family, the rule is that unless you have a job you shouldn't use your own money for presents. Despite that, I still like getting people gifts.

Two years ago I told my brother I wanted body tracking so that I could use a character skin I made for virtual reality for my birthday. He told me it was expensive (it was 90$, so I understand) and that he wouldn’t be praised because it didn’t ‘look’ expensive. So he bought me a Nintendo Switch. He bought all the parts separately from second-hand sellers. He told our family it was 200$ dollars even though he bought it for 40$. I know this because he bragged about it to me. 

He knew that I didn’t like Nintendo Switches because I told him prior. So it’s practically his now.

Last year I gave him 100 dollars for his present. Typically that's the amount we give to family members. For my birthday he didn’t get me anything. I assumed he was busy with studies. He still wished me a happy birthday though.

This year he bought my cousin an expensive pair of jeans. However, my uncle paid him back the money.

His birthday came and I had school so I couldn't see him. I left a note on his desk and a 100$ telling him a happy birthday. I came back home and I asked my mom if my brother got my gift. I learned that he told our mom that the money he had on his desk was his own. My mother scolded him for not telling her I gave him his present. He requested not to have a party with us and went out with his girlfriend.

As my birthday approached my mom talked to him about having a combined party because neither of us wanted a party for our birthdays. We declined. This is important because it proved to me that my brother knew that my birthday was coming up.

Fast forward to my birthday, and in the morning my brother told me happy birthday and hugged me. (he knows that I hate hugs). Hours later he came into my room and said he 'forgot' it was my birthday. Then he asked me what I wanted. I told him to forget it and leave. 

Later my mom learned hasn’t gotten me anything in two years. My mom lectured him. She didn’t believe him when he said he forgot and she knew that he had more than enough money to get me something because she had access to his bank account. She also gives him extra money on top of his job.

A few hours later he came back with a bean bag chair. He ordered it the same day. My room is cramped because my brother's dorm stuff is all in my room so it couldn’t fit here.

A gut feeling made me think this was a gift to redeem himself in my mom's eyes. Also, this would just be something my brother would use in the future instead of me.

After I said I didn’t want it he argued with my mom and insulted me in my native language. He asked my mom if I was on my period. In the end, he returned it and kept the money.

My mom changed her opinion and claimed that I’m dramatic and mean now.

Now he's been asking because he wants to take our youngest (4 month old girl) to see her. MIL threw  fit because she did not get to see the baby when she was born, and accused me of cheating/said the baby was not my FHs because of skin color.

My fiances argument is even though MIL has said hurtful things to our oldest, the youngest is a baby and won't remember anything. I know that's true and I know he wants her to havw a relationship with his mom I just feel like I can't trust her. And now my husband has stopped doing any care for our youngest when he normally does at least equal if not more than I do.

So Lynn is a girl im in adult ballet class with and we get along very well. I’d say she is a good friend but we often don’t see or hear each other for Bouts of time since we have different lives OUTSIDE of the class and it sometimes just isnt easy. Nevertheless we are very open and I consider her quite a close friend.

In June Lynn got into a car incident and moves temporarily back to her parents.
When I just heard about it I immediately texted her and asked if I could do anything and she Told me it was very hard for her to text with the injuries.

Then over the course of the summer, I did not hear from her nor contact her considering she was too far away for me to be able to help and that she had Told me it was so hard to text. Furthermore I was going through a lot of turmoil at my job and carrier changes and did not want to bother her with this. I also had a long business trip on which I was often without data or wifi. And I was quite miserable there as well due to it being the last few weeks at my job that was exploiting me.

Then i went on my own holiday and went offline most of the time. And at the end of it, I had planned a secret wedding ceremony with 4 friends. This is something that I did with my husband because we did not want the stress and expectations of a real wedding but just wanted a private night celebrating our love and host a party the year after, without the classic reception and ceremony so less stress less Hassle, very us. NO ONE KNEW ABOUT THIS Except the four people who were with us. Not even my family. We did however take pictures because it was a beautiful day and we decided to share them on socials after, because we were Proud and we did want to tell people that we had the ceremony. We just didnt want prying eyes. And also it served as a good prompt to tell people that there Will be a party next year and tha they are invited. 

Now BEFORE these got posted, i texted Lynn the day I arrived back home from holiday. Asking if she recovered, telling her i had a chaotic summer and was sorry I had not found time earlier to check in, and asking if it was possible to meet up in Any capacity. This was August 20.

She did not reply.
August 27 i posted my pictures on fb and Lynn texted me saying “you got married?????” And I replied “yes heehee it was very fun but more importantly next year there is a party and you have to be there !!!!!”

She did not reply.
Today I asked her again how she is and can she meet up.

August 27 i posted my pictures on fb and Lynn texted me saying “you got married?????” And I replied “yes heehee it was very fun but more importantly next year there is a party and you have to be there !!!!!”
(I always text this way a bit silly)

She did not reply.
Today I asked her again how she is and can she meet up. I then received a 5 minute voice note telling me it was outrageous that I “went no-contact” and that she had to find out about the wedding via Instagram, that she expects friends to check in with each other and that I find not tell her stuff.",0.0,1.0429853200912476,1,0
51,1f47ph9,AITAH for telling my grandma that I didn’t like my nails?,"I (17F) and my grandma (70F) went to get my nails done for back to school.I spent hours resurching nail salons around my area. After a while I found a place that had pretty good reviews. I showed my grandma a picture of what I wanted done and she made a appointment. The picture was of about medium length acrylic French tips. I thought they were perfect and I loved how they looked.

The next day my grandma drove me to the nail salon and the lady and I started to talk about my nails. I showed her the picture and she rudely looked my up and down and told me that my fingers weren't the right shape and that they wouldn't look good on a ""girl like me"". I thought nothing of it and thought she didn't mean it. She was about half way through doing my nails and  they looked horrible. The polish she put on was messy and bumpy. She stared to do the French tips and they were also bumpy and uneven. She finished my nails an hour later and I'm not going to lie, but they just looked horrible.

My grandma said she would pay even though I offered to pay her back but she said it was her treat. We went to the front desk and the total was $55. My grandma scoffed 
And paid. We thanked them and walked out. I told my grandma that I thought they did a horrible job and I thought he lady was pretty rude. In her words ""you are so ungrateful they look exactly like the picture I think she was great"" I got home and started crying. My childhood wasn't the greatest as I had a bad relationship with my parents. I was never good enough for them as they had always expected too much from me, they were always disappointed. The reason I cried because of my grandma is she used to always make me happy, her house was always the place for me to go when my parents didn't want me around. 

She started to tell family and friends her side of the story and I started to get messages from everyone basically telling me that I am in the wrong and I should be ashamed for my behaviour. Personally I think they are all blowing this out if proportion.

52,1f47ouv,AITA for asking my housemate to move their stuff from my freezer space?,"I (24F) live in a rented house with seven other people. It's an HMO (House of Multiple Occupancy), so we all have our own rooms and bathrooms but share a kitchen. Because space is limited, we each get half a cupboard, two fridge shelves, and one freezer shelf.

Earlier today, I went to grab something from the freezer to make lunch and noticed that someone had put their food on my shelf. It’s already tight with space, so I posted a message in our group chat asking whoever did it to move their food. My exact words were: ""Whoever put their food in my bit of the freezer, please move them. It's really not fair taking up someone else's bit of the freezer with your stuff."" I also attached a picture of the freezer shelf.

The food was moved pretty quickly, but later, one of my housemates passed me in the hallway and mentioned that I could have been ""much nicer"" in my message. This caught me off guard because I didn’t think my message was rude—I just asked for my space back. Plus, people have posted similar reminders in the chat, like asking others to clean up after themselves, and no one seemed to think those were a big deal.

Now, I’m second-guessing myself. I didn’t mean to come off as rude, but maybe I was too blunt? AITA?

53,1f47cq5,AITAH? My family changed plans and then left without me when I am the one who originally made the plans ,"So my family and I were suppose to originally do an escape room and get a bite to eat near where my big sister and I work, we planned this a week ago. I have to work in early evening today, Everyone in my family knew this.

On the day of the plans, my sister calls me to tell me that they changed it to be at a place an hour away. (give or take traffic)

Since these were not a part of the original plans, they had said that we could carpool with my big sister. But I  didn’t want  have to worry about potentially ruining anybody else’s plans if they wanted to do something while they were out in that area. 

I explained that I didn’t want to travel that far  away to do something that would take 2 hours, and then I have to drive right back to make it in time for work. I asked why we couldn’t stick with the original plan as that was the one that worked originally for all of us and I wouldn’t have to worry about making it back to work in time. 

My big sister then revoked the carpool option, saying they didn’t want to deal with me and needing to get back to work. 

My whole family disagreed with me, said that I would make it back to work in time and that I should go because this was plans for one of my sister’s birthdays and they wanted to go. However keep in mind they didn’t know about this place until I had suggested it, and once again not for today . 

My sisters then got mad because I was  trying to persuade them to try to do our original plan.

My big sister kept telling me how I was making it stressful, and she was very angry, and that I could either choose to go or not, and that it was for her birthday.

Although originally I had made these plans for today, as  something to celebrate but not directly for her birthday. It was more for us to hang out with family and do something. Im not sure where this is solely for her birthday came into place.  

Especially because her birthday is actually tomorrow, in which we are going to celebrate. 

My big sister calls me to tell me that I ruined everything and that they’re not gonna go because they don’t wanna make me feel left out and suddenly starts agreeing with the fact that yeah I could be late to work or not make it in time for work and so they are not going anywhere because I messed up the vibe 

I called my other sister to tell them to just go and go without me

My other sister was very upset as well as she said that I was exaggerating, and that I would be able to make it back to work, and that was our time to spend together

I told her I know I had planned for this to be a family day, but I needed to make sure that I got back to work in time that I did no longer want to be a part of the family plans as no one was considering my time constraint . 

They did in fact leave, and I am still very upset as what was originally suppose to be a day of fun has not turned into a day wee everyone is doing something without me. When I had originally come up with the idea to even do something today..

56,1f46v6m,AITA for selling my Eras Tour tickets instead of giving them to my sister in law? ,"Hi everyone. I’m 31 f living in San Diego. About a year ago I got two tickets to Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour for this December in Vancouver, Canada. My sister in law (29 f) has never been a huge Taylor Swift fan (she even was offered a chance to go to the Eras Tour last year but said no because she doesn’t like her music that much) but I asked if she wanted to go with me and she said yes. 

Fast forward a couple of months and I am now expecting a baby. The concert is December 6 and my due date is December 7. At first I was adamant I was still going to try and make it to the concert but I soon came to the realization it just wasn’t in the cards for me. I offered to let her have the tickets if she wanted to take her daughter who is a big Taylor swift fan and she said she didn’t want to go if I wasn’t going. A couple weeks go by and I tell her I’m thinking about just selling my tickets and she tells me shes still going with or without me and that her nail tech wants to go with her which kind of put me off a little because they’re my tickets and not hers to be deciding who is using them (she never even offered to pay me face value for them). 

Long story short I end up selling the tickets for $4,000 in total which will be a perfect little nest egg for me while I am on maternity leave. She has since completely stopped communicating with me. We were pretty much best friends before this. She doesn’t reply to anything I send her about the baby (ultrasound pics etc), stopped sharing her location, and now is looking to go out of town the day of my baby shower which has been planned for months.

57,1f46uf6,AITA for not talking much when I'm at my dad's house?,"Since I (16m) was a kid I had times where I deal with selective mutism because of my stutter. When I have a really bad time with my stutter it can trigger the mutism. There are also times I'm really uncomfortable and it triggers even before the stutter can. There are situations where I talk way less/hardly talk, to be more comfortable.

My dad's house has been one of those places since I was 7. It's when my dad moved his wife and her kids in. Her kids used to laugh when I talked and she'd ask me to repeat myself a bunch of times because she couldn't understand me. My dad also fucked up by bringing her along to my speech appointments as soon as they were living together which I really wasn't comfortable with and didn't like. So I ended up talking way less at his house. I still talk occasionally but I'm not comfortable around his family. And it's worse when his wife's parents visit (once a year roughly) because I don't say a word during their visits. This bothers his wife and her kids think I'm weird because I'm either freaky quiet (how they describe it) or talk so fucking weird.

My dad tried family therapy but communication was tricky. He refused to have sessions just me and him like the therapist wanted and he quit. Tried again with a different therapy, who made the same suggestion. So he quit again.

My dad's wife told my dad they need to figure something out about me because it unnerves her how quiet I am and she doesn't like feeling bad in her own house and that's how she feels when I'm there and hardly talking. Or when I never talk when her family visits.

Dad brought me out and we talked about it over the weekend. I told him (for the millionth time) I'm just not comfortable. He told me I could try harder, could show them that we're a family and I can be just as comfortable around them as I am around him and my mom and my biological family members. I told him I can't show them that because I'm not. I told him I talk some, mostly to his wife, but I'm always going to be quieter than he might like. He wanted to bring his wife to my speech therapist again and I said no. I told him I am not okay with that. He told me mom already said no and he was hoping I'd answer differently.

He told me it feels like I'm trying to destroy the life he's built and that it's a shitty thing to have people in the family this long and say so little to them and his house should be one of the two places I can talk and he's worked so hard to do that for me, so he knows I'm just being selfish and stubborn.

My parents had moved 3,000km from my hometown beside Toronto & it was discussed that all of us are going including boyfriend. Fast forward months later in July, the big move comes around. We all drive to Alberta with boyfriend as well. He stays for 5 days and then flys home to work a few more weeks then to go Portugal to see family he hasn’t seen in 10 years. I can’t be mad cause it’s family and MIL booked this months ago. 

Boyfriend has always had his small doubts & fears about the move, however has been very very reassuring about it. I haven’t been worried up until two days ago. Boyfriend has been very very afraid and worried to the point he is second guessing the move… now I am over here, 6,000km away from him panicking and literally going absolutely crazy since his arrival to the new home is expected by the end of September. 

I can understand the fear of change and not having your 60 family members 20km away. However this was discussed and pretty much set in stone. He does have his little moments sometimes since he is an over thinker. I have reassured him that this doesn’t have to be a permanent living situation & that it isn’t fair to not give it a try & so on. He claims he is lost and I feel absolutely awful.

We have purchased loads of new furniture and moved all of my things here so going back would be a shit show. I am wondering if this feeling will pass since he is a huge over thinker and a bit scared of change. He’s been messaging me throughout the day & still calling me which is usual for him but I feel like I am also loosing him to this. I am also a huge over thinker and I am super sensitive. 
We have had a good relationship over the years and has never given me a reason to not trust him or make me overthink the amount I am right now.

Then today, I reminded him of his chores and left the house. When I come back it's raining, so understandable that the yard chores wasn't complete but then my mother(F82) rushed out of the house to tell me that my sons closet was a mess and the maid had seen it.

• He did clean his room, he had just missed under his bed and the closet which were a mess.

• I told him he tainted the family name.

• He has been planning this weekend for 2 weeks and was very excited for it.

• He hasn't seen one of these friends in months

I am very mindful and respectful that he's hitting puberty and give him space and boundaries.

Right now Ethan going through a phase where he doesn't any adult relative posting any picture or video of him on their social media account. The of exceptions is if you're between the ages of 14 to 25 and doing something fun or makes him look cool.

His mom and stepdad love posting pictures of their family all the time. Ethan told them not to post pictures of him. His stepdad told him to not post family pictures without him is like letting him not shower or brush his teeth. It's sorta required.

My son complained to me and I said I'm not getting involved with how they run their home. To me, it's not a hill worth dying over. Ethan let them know how he felt. 

I had Ethan all week and he goes back to his mom's on Saturday. He refuses to go back because he doesn't want to go to the family Labor Day camping trip where he'll be photographed. I asked my son if this was really worth fighting over and he believes so.

I spoke to his mom and she thought it was ridiculous. I said I agree but this is just some weird tween boy power trip thing so just promise not to take his picture. She refused. Now Ethan refuses to go on the trip.

Last night his stepdad and maternal uncle called him separately. Both times resulted in Ethan crying. They basically told him his ass was going. That pissed me off. I called them both up and said my custody issues with his mom is none of their business. I agree it's stupid and a compromise could had been met. Now that you all inserted yourself into the matter, I have no choice but to let him stay here if he wants. 

His mom is mad at ME. I told her to just drop it and you can take him for a few extra days when you get back. The situation has gotten too dramatic. It's not like he doesn't want to go back because he has to clean his room. He has to know that his stepdad and uncle are not calling the shots too. She is furious at me and says I'm encouraging bad behavior by letting him stay here. Ironically I'm way more strict than she is. 

Edit: This has nothing to do with taking his picture. He loves having his picture taking with the older kids or the young adults because he think it makes him look cool. Anything to do with older people makes him feel like he's 5.

65,1f45ee3,WIBTA for stopping therapy because I don't respect my therapist?,"I (35M) have always been very focused on self improvement. I read frequently, work out, do mindfulness exercises and meditation, affirmations, journaling, and focus quite a bit on my career and personal growth through things like getting better at hobbies, doing side projects, and making enjoyable memories with my kids. Areas that I am lacking in are definitely my social life - I'm a hermit by nature, love my alone time, and hate crowds and awkward social situations.

After having gone through a rough break up, I decided to start seeing a therapist. I've had 3 sessions with him so far. I feel uncomfortable talking to my therapist because:

He is extremely overweight. I'm not talking about a little husky, I'm talking very obese to the point where it's difficult for him to get up and shake my hand when I walk into the office. This makes me uncomfortable for two reasons. 

1. Working out and taking care of my body is extremely important to me because it not only keeps me attractive, but also helps me achieve other goals in my life. Talking about my fitness to him makes me feel very uncomfortable because I realize the physical condition that he is in. 

2. One of the focal points of my therapy has been past relationship dynamics and me debating whether I ever want another relationship or if I just want to stay single. Once again, I am able to be picky with what I accept into my life and I'm met with comments like ""Well, no one really wants to be single. Everyone wants a partner"" or ""Older men don't do well alone"".

3. One of the things that we were talking about early on was boundaries and he made a backhanded comment about how he should set a boundary with me because I forgot my FSA card. Maybe it wasn't intended to be rude, but I've held onto that.

4. Another focal point of the therapy is how I can expand my social circle and get more involved. Many of the possible possibilities that I've brought up have been met with his own personal stories of negative chit chat for 10-15 minutes at a time.

  
tl;dr: It's difficult for me, as a man, to be accepting of advice from someone who isn't in (and has never been) in the same chapter of life as me. It feels like I'm the asshole when I say ""I don't want to do therapy with him because he's fat"", but the reality is that his lifestyle choices in many areas don't align with mine and it's difficult for me to take advice from someone who I don't want to be like.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-29,"WIBTA for stopping therapy because I don't respect my therapist?

Anyway, I’m having a baby shower for my 2nd child. My mom and I were discussing RSVP’s and she said “I will be there and so will my fiance and Mary”. I reminded her it was just girls who will be there and she said she forgot but that it will be her and Mary. I explained to her that I want her to be there for sure, but unfortunately Mary is going to have to stay with her dad. My mom asked if it was a kid free baby shower and if my 4 year old daughter will be there. I said yes she will be there. No it isn’t child free, but explained to her that Mary has been mean to my daughter in the past, every single time Mary is around my daughter she is snatching from her, pushing her, and just being mean. They are the same age but Mary is clearly not being disciplined at home and I don’t want to be worrying about whether or not my daughter is being bullied at the baby shower.

My mom said Mary is 4 years old and doesn’t know any better.

My mom says she wants to bring Mary regardless or she might just have to send a present to my home and not come.

I have friends and family siding with me saying I’m being reasonable for not wanting to have to stress about Mary interacting with my daughter at the shower, but family who is siding with my mom and saying I should just invite Mary so my mom can come to the shower.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-29,"AITA for excluding my mom’s  “step-daughter” from my baby shower? I will be referring to the “step-daughter” as Mary. I say step daughter in quotes because her (my mom) and her fiance are not married and have no plans of marrying each other anytime soon. That’s another story.

Anyway, I’m having a baby shower for my 2nd child. My mom and I were discussing RSVP’s and she said “I will be there and so will my fiance and Mary”. I reminded her it was just girls who will be there and she said she forgot but that it will be her and Mary. I explained to her that I want her to be there for sure, but unfortunately Mary is going to have to stay with her dad. My mom asked if it was a kid free baby shower and if my 4 year old daughter will be there. I said yes she will be there. No it isn’t child free, but explained to her that Mary has been mean to my daughter in the past, every single time Mary is around my daughter she is snatching from her, pushing her, and just being mean. They are the same age but Mary is clearly not being disciplined at home and I don’t want to be worrying about whether or not my daughter is being bullied at the baby shower.

69,1f44qd9,AITA for answering my daugher's question honestly?,"My (43F) daughter (14F) recently asked me whether or not my pregnancy with her was planned. I didn't know why she would be wondering that, but she said it's because she is an only child and me and my husband (46M) had only known each other a year when she was conceived. These were things she already knew obviously, and she was curious whether or not she had been a mistake.

I obviously don't want to lie to my daughter, especially not about something like this. I told her that her intuition was correct, she was indeed a mistake. But I also made it clear to her that even if we didn't want to have her, we still did and we love her. I explained to her that obviously, if me and my husband could go back in time and change the past, of course we would change things, make sure no unplanned accidents happened and things went the way we want instead of how they did go in reality. But we can't change the past, she is here now and we love her a lot, despite the unfortunate facts around her birth. 

She seemed to take it well at that time, but ever since that conversation she has seemed very down, hasn't really wanted to talk to us at all. I'm not stupid, so I know it's because she's ashamed/upset about being a mistake. I tried to tell her again that what happened is unfortunate, but what's done is done and we love her despite it. She was not very receptive to that, so I told her that if she's going to be upset at the answer to her question, she shouldn't ask it. I'm not going to lie to her about how she was conceived, even if the truth is uncomfortable. She got even more upset at that, I'm not sure if more angry or sad or both. 

I'm not sure what to do. Was I in the wrong for telling her the truth? I thought a 14 year old would be handling it fine. Should I have lied instead?

The weekend chores are split 50/50, I do the majority of the cooking as I'm the better cook and I enjoy cooking a lot more than my gf and we alternate days with doing the dishes.

Recently my girlfriend has been asking me at least once or twice a week to do the dishes on her night. She'll always have an excuse like she's tired and keeps going on about it until I agree to it.

I mentioned to her that it was starting to get annoying now that I'm cooking most night but also doing the dishes most nights and that she needs to start doing her half. She downplayed how much she's actually asking but then the following night asked again.

I told her I would do them if we changed how the chores are divided because I'm currently doing more and it should be even. I said she should either start doing the laundry more often or take one of the chores I do on a weekend.

She said on to this and said it wasn't fair so I just told her that I'd no longer be helping her whenever she can't be bothered to do the dishes. I pointed out she very obviously sees this as one way and that unless she starts making it reciprocal then she ca do her own share of the chores and not ask me.

She'll text my wife during the middle of the night, randomly pop over; she's just been clingy, and she'll guilt trip my wife whenever she has plans, or feels stressed. So I told Emma that we need space, that she needs boundaries.

He lives about an hour and a half away and commutes on the train. He told me he’d get the train at 9pm, the last one that goes to his home town. I was working until 11pm and told him to enjoy the night and get home safe. When I finished work I check my phone and I have four missed calls from him, he had missed the last train home. The buses to where I live (we’re medium distance) run pretty much all night and he was wondering if he could crash at mine for the night and I’d bring him into work the next day. I called my mother and she went ballistic, saying that I am not his taxi and that our house is not a hotel, and that he was taking advantage of me. I argued with her that is the roles were reversed, he would do the same for me. To make matters worse, his phone was dying and there was a concert on that night in the city, so there was loads of people waiting for the same bus he was getting. He texted me telling me to assume he’d be on that bus and to pick him up. My mother wasn’t happy with my driving half an hour down the road at midnight, even though it’s the same drive I do everyday to commute to college. Anyway, she insisted on coming with me even though I have my full license and I am well used to those roads. The car ride was awkward, silence the whole way home. When we got back, she yelled at him. Of course it’s an inconvenience, but again, he’d do it for me and it was genuinely his last resort.

73,1f436k2,AITAH for learning a foreign language without telling my wife?,"English is my native language, and I struggled to learn it due to a learning disability. As a child I studied Spanish in school, but suffered from a combination of my disability and learned helplessness. Needless to say, I never really learned spanish.

  
Fast forward 15 years, and I've been happily married for four years. My wife is Japanese, so naturally I tried to learn Japanese to share a bit of her language and culture with her. I've tried off and on to learn Japanese for around two years, but I always fell off the wagon after a month or two and never made much progress.

A year ago I decided to learn Spanish on a whim. I knew it would be easier than Japanese, and I secretly hoped that I would actually be able to learn it since my struggles with English as a child have made my monolingualism a source of insecurity. I didn't tell my wife when I started for two reasons. First, I expected to fail like I had failed many times before with Japanese and didn't want to make learning Spanish into a ""thing"" only to abandon it shortly after. Second, I thought that my wife would be disappointed or even offended that I was investing my time into learning Spanish instead of Japanese.

To my surprise, I actually stuck to learning Spanish and made progress, and before I knew it I was 6 months into studying it and could actually understand intermediate level Spanish. I thought about telling my wife then, but wasn't sure how to break the news. Another 6 months later and while my Spanish is far from perfect, I'm around a B2 level and can converse, watch TV, and read comfortably in Spanish.

I finally broke the news to my wife and she was pissed. According to her, she's less upset about me learning Spanish instead of Japanese, and more upset about me never mentioning that I've been learning it over the past year. From her perspective I basically lied to her for an entire year. This is sort of true, but on the other hand, if I had spent the last year mastering Tetris without telling her I don't think she would feel the same way. For that reason, I feel like deep down she's really upset that I learned Spanish instead of Japanese, even though the two languages are vastly different in terms of difficulty for an native English speaker.

She said don't bother she'll make herself some toast given that I'm unable to see what she needs when she's sick. I said I'll make the toast and she said no don't bother she's making it herself now it's too late. Then she made me get out the kitchen and now I'm sad I feel incompetent. Am I really the AH here for not being able to know how to take care of her when she's sick? We've been together 5 years and she often says she feels like she can't rely on me to be there for her and I'm not able to figure out what she needs unless given explicit instructions which she's not able to do when she's sick ",0.0,-0.0007876169402152,0,1
77,1f41sls,AITA for kicking my friend out of my apartment after he wrecked my car and refused to pay for damages?,"I’m (25M) in a serious bind right now and could use some advice. A few months ago, my friend “Dan” (26M) hit a rough patch—lost his job, and his girlfriend kicked him out. We’ve been close for years, so I didn’t hesitate when he asked if he could crash on my couch until he got back on his feet.

Dan moved in, and at first, things were okay. He was actively looking for work and helping out around the apartment. I was covering most of the bills, but I figured that’s what friends do when one is down. I didn’t expect anything in return—just that he’d get on his feet and pay me back in other ways, like covering groceries or taking me out once he got a job.

But then things started to go south. Dan became more comfortable, and by that, I mean he stopped trying to find work. He’d spend all day on the couch playing video games, and any time I asked him how the job search was going, he’d brush me off with “I’ve got some leads” or “I’m waiting to hear back.” Meanwhile, I’m covering rent, utilities, food—everything.

The breaking point came last weekend. I had to work late, so I left my car keys on the kitchen counter. Dan doesn’t have a car, and I made it clear when he moved in that he couldn’t use mine. But when I got home that night, my car was gone. I called Dan, and he casually told me he’d taken it out to grab some drinks with friends. I was furious, but it got worse when he came back—my car was trashed. Scratches along the side, a dent in the front bumper, and it reeked of cigarettes (which I don’t even smoke).

When I confronted Dan, he shrugged it off like it was no big deal. He said his friend “knows a guy” who can fix it for cheap and that I shouldn’t worry. But when I asked him to pay for the damages, he flat-out refused, saying he didn’t have any money and that I was overreacting. I was livid. This wasn’t some minor scratch—it was going to cost me a couple of grand to fix everything.

So, I told him to get out. I didn’t care where he went or what he did, but I couldn’t keep supporting him when he was treating me and my stuff like garbage. Dan flipped out, saying I was abandoning him when he needed me the most. He called me selfish, said I was letting money come between our friendship, and even accused me of never really caring about him.

Our mutual friends are split. Some think I did the right thing by kicking him out, saying he was taking advantage of me. Others think I overreacted and should have given him more time to sort things out, especially since he didn’t have anywhere else to go.

Now I’m questioning if I was too harsh. AITA for kicking him out after he wrecked my car and refused to pay for it?

Edit:

To clarify, I’m not just angry about the car. It’s the principle—he was living here rent-free, eating my food, using my stuff, and then wrecked my car without even asking. The car is my main way of getting to work, so it’s not just a small inconvenience. I could have lost my job if I didn’t have it to get around. And after reading the comments , i am starting to think about pressing charges on stealing the car, not for the money, but so he knows that its wrong and unacceptable 

Edit 2: 

Since alot are asking about pressing charges to get insurance money, i am not struggling financially, so fixing the car wont be a problem, but the main reason i am going to press charges is that he f*cked me up so i am going to f*ck him up , so he know he wont always get away with it .",Not the A-hole,2024-08-29,"AITA for kicking my friend out of my apartment after he wrecked my car and refused to pay for damages?

78,1f41kn3,"AITA for kicking out my friend for referring to my wife as my ""partner""?","I'll keep this brief.

My wife Julia and I have been married for a while. There's a ""friend"" of mine at work, Aiden, who visited my house yesterday. He had never seen Julia before but knows that we are married.

The gist is this: when he saw her, his first response was ""Oh, so that's your partner, is it?"" I was very much offended since I consider it a ridiculous term. I think it's both formal (which shouldn't be the case for a romantic relationship) and lacks warmth. I snapped ""No, she's my *wife*, Julia.""

Aiden seemed surprised & said ""Yeah, that's what I meant. She's your partner."" I retorted by saying that I do not want him to use that term when referring to her relationship with me since we are not business partners. Julia was offended as well.

Now I didn't want to make a big deal, but he just doubled down. He said he ""had no f\*\*\*\*\*\*\* idea what I am talking about"" and that I cannot police his language. I asked him whether he thinks that a romantic relationship is just a business-like transaction.

The upshot is that I demanded an apology, which he refused to give, and also continued spouting that garbage. In the end I kicked him out. He called us ""crazy lunatics"" as he left, and some other people are mad as well.

80,1f412sm,AITA for not letting my best friend tell me about her relationship with my ex situationship?,"
Hi everyone! This is my first post so sorry if it sounds a bit scattered and massive but I need to get some un bias opinions. So for context. I was talking to this guy (E) that all my friends were pushing for me to go out with and loose my virginity too. (I didn’t thank god) We talked for like 3 months, didn’t do anything, hold hands or even kiss. All he did was give me his chain. 

I went to a party with E once and he very very drunkenly flirted with a mutual friend of mine. Obviously I went back home balling my eyes out in my room while my best friend (M) is in the next room knowing exactly what happened and why I’m upset. (Me and M live together at this point in time) Eventually me and E stopped talking (*this is important*) because he thought I wanted to date him instead of mess around. 

I move states a few weeks later (I still go down to my home town every week) and things are fine until about 2 or 3 months later. Mind you I haven’t liked anyone like I liked this boy ever since (but I can’t see myself dating him anymore, it’s about the moral not the boy). 
So my best friend starts to build a flirty friendship with him while I’m gone because he’s also friends with M’s little brother. And as you’d expect things start to progress. 

At a certain point in time they’re hanging while I’m hanging with them too and I put two and two together obviously and ask her about it. She then goes on to tell me she’s starting to catch feelings and her family has been pushing them together, (all the credit to her for this bit) she asks if she can fuck around and I guilt trip myself into saying of course cause I haven’t done anything with him before and he’s making her happy but I ask if there’s a chance they’d be able not to date cause that would really mean a lot to me since that was the catalyst in our situationship. She says of course, time goes by then she mentions how she’s going to the movies with him that weekend before she even realised it was a date. So I cave and say I’m ok with it cause after some processing, she’s happy and why would I stop her from dating someone that wants to date her BUT!! 

This is where the AITA comes in.
I stated I don’t want to watch them being super touchy or flirty, I will hang with them as mates but if I see anything PDA in front of my eyes (idc what happens when I’m not looking) I need to set a boundary to not let myself fall into ‘I was never good enough to date’ and not be around them as often but she’s now saying she’s really upset she can’t share these experiences with me as her bestie. But all I’m seeing right now is she wants to be completely happy, have the man and the bestie, while I have to suffer thinking I’ll always be unworthy of dating and my best friend would choose a hoe over a bro but that could be my anger giving me tunnel vision

81,1f40vcj,AITA for refusing to stop drinking even though my sibling and parents are really worried about me?,"Throwaway account because I don’t want this connected to my main.

So, I’m an 18-year-old guy, and recently, my older brother passed away due to an alcohol-related incident (he unbeknownst to us was an alcoholic). It’s been really hard on my family, and everyone’s still grieving. My sibling (who’s a bit older than me) has been really adamant that I should stop drinking alcohol until I turn 21, and has offered to go sober with me until then. They’ve talked to me multiple times about it, saying that drinking at a young age increases the risk of developing alcoholism, and they’re worried that I could end up like our brother.

I’ve told them that alcohol isn’t that important to me, but I’m also not willing to completely give it up. I understand where they’re coming from, and I know they’re just worried about me, but I feel like I should be able to make my own decisions. I’m not drinking often or anything like that, and I don’t think it’s fair to ask me to stop completely just because of what happened to our brother. I feel like they’re projecting their fear onto me and trying to control my choices.

My sibling sent me a message recently, basically saying they don’t understand my decisions and that it feels like I’m prioritizing alcohol over the well-being and emotional peace of our family. They also said that if I ever feel like alcohol is becoming a problem, I can come to them for help.

I get that they’re scared and upset, but I also think that I should be allowed to live my life without being pressured to make decisions based on their fears. I’ve been respectful and tried to explain my side, but they still seem really emotionally devastated that I’m not agreeing to give up alcohol.

83,1f402ft,AITA for wanting to drop my friend of 4 years a day before a big national exam? ,"
I (16F) have been friends with Hazel (17F) for almost 4 years since the beginning of sec 1 and became a duo together. in sec 2, Faith (16F) joined our group with another girl, turning into a quad but stuff happened and that girl dropped Faith, thus making me, Hazel and Faith a trio. me and Faith liked the same boy in sec 2 but dismissed the situation. In sec 3, me and Faith got close to one another, making it look like me and Faith are the duo in the trio when originally it was me and Hazel. To cut things short to sec 4, I ended up having an eye candy on the same boy from sec 2 and Faith got to listen to my delusions a bit too well to the point she fell inlove with him and lied to me for 4 ish months that she liked someone else thus causing a really messy disbandment of the trio.

Now with the real problem, Hazel was not happy about the trio breaking up and tried to make me and Faith ammend with each other which she failed but she specifically stated that she was on my side due to how I was so called betrayed. She then told me she promises to spend her time equally between me and Faith. it has been 4 months and it's more like she spends 80% of her time with Faith instead, from going out, eating together, going classes with each other and ect. etc. Whenever I try to initiate something, it would be laughed off by her and never be spoken again. Hazel will only come to me when she needs something from me or when Faith is absent from school, basically excluding me from everything.

Plus with given info that they talk about me behind my back, Hazel had actually knew Faith liking the same guy but decided to lie to me and entertain Faith with her delusions and making fun of me.

Now our national exam is coming up in 2-3 weeks time and I feel burnt out trying to keep the friendship upfloat but I can't help but feel outcasted away or being the last choice even though I really enjoyed being her friend despite everything. 

I only want to drop her like a day before our national exams out of spite but what should I do, should I just continue being her friend even though it's just hanging on a loose thread or just finally end it between us since there's not really a point anymore. AITA?
",TL;DR,2024-08-29,"AITA for wanting to drop my friend of 4 years a day before a big national exam?  
I (16F) have been friends with Hazel (17F) for almost 4 years since the beginning of sec 1 and became a duo together. in sec 2, Faith (16F) joined our group with another girl, turning into a quad but stuff happened and that girl dropped Faith, thus making me, Hazel and Faith a trio. me and Faith liked the same boy in sec 2 but dismissed the situation. In sec 3, me and Faith got close to one another, making it look like me and Faith are the duo in the trio when originally it was me and Hazel. To cut things short to sec 4, I ended up having an eye candy on the same boy from sec 2 and Faith got to listen to my delusions a bit too well to the point she fell inlove with him and lied to me for 4 ish months that she liked someone else thus causing a really messy disbandment of the trio.

Now with the real problem, Hazel was not happy about the trio breaking up and tried to make me and Faith ammend with each other which she failed but she specifically stated that she was on my side due to how I was so called betrayed. She then told me she promises to spend her time equally between me and Faith. it has been 4 months and it's more like she spends 80% of her time with Faith instead, from going out, eating together, going classes with each other and ect. etc. Whenever I try to initiate something, it would be laughed off by her and never be spoken again. Hazel will only come to me when she needs something from me or when Faith is absent from school, basically excluding me from everything.

84,1f3zvb7,AITAH for not vaccuming long enough?,"I (19f) got into a fight with my mom (49f) while cleaning the house today. 

My mother is a clean freak, for reference when I was a kid and my clothes weren't folded up perfectly in my closet she would yell at me loud enough that the neigbours asked the next day if everything was allright at home and then proceeded to throw my entire closets' content on the groud in my room and slam the door on it so hard it broke. And this happened multiple times. 

So, we live in a 2 story house, and thursdays are cleaning days. I always clean the whole upper floor which includes my room, a bathroom, a office/guest bedroom and my parents bedroom. Two of the rooms (office and parents bedroom) have carpets that you can't see dirt/dust on. The other rooms have flooring that you can see hair or dust on very well as they are all light colours. 

The upper floor is always quicker to clean as downstairs also includes the living room and kitchen which are both fairly big rooms with a lot of shelves and surfaces that need to be dusted off and are full of decorations and clutter. So when my mom is finishing up with dusting the last room I am already on vaccuming the upper floor. 

Today it took me maybe 20 minutes to do so, and when I took the vaccum downstairs my mom looked at me weird and asked me if I was finished already. When I said yes she then proceeded to tell me I was way too quick to be able to do a good job at it and to do it again. I refused saying I did a good job and she could go have a look if she didn't believe me. 

She did and as expected, found nothing. But then she told me that I obviously slacked off in the carpeted rooms where she can't see the dirt as I knew she would have no proof of me doing so. I told her she was being ridiculous. 

Then she started yelling at me about being lazy and ungratefull and how she asked me to do one thing around the house to help her and I can't even do that properly. Which again, not true, I help with everything and anything she asks me to do. Not to mention I have been the sole person doing the entire households laundry, mowing the lawn and taking care of our pets for years now. I also cook, clean, help my dad with renovations on the house and around the garden and also help with fixing the family car of needed. By no means am I complaining about any of this, I think it's normal to help around your parents' home, especially if you still live with them and it's the least you could do for them.

88,1f3xqt8,AITA for asking my boyfriend to not purchase another motorcycle? ,"I’m going to try and keep this very short, if more info is required, I am happy to reply to comments. 

My boyfriend has owned 3 motorcycles since we’ve been together and at all. He grew up with one small motorcycle which he’d sometimes use every few months with his father until he was around 10. 

My top three reasons for asking him to not purchase another one are below. Edit for clarity: the accident was before he owned a bike of his own.

1. The first bike he owned had to have a lot of work done to it which put him into a bad position financially. He asked me for help and I lent him over $3000 to pay for the work necessary for the bike to run. I told him that it causes a lot of stress when they seem to always fall apart and need work done to them that then puts him into a difficult financial position.

2. The second bike he owned he purchased at a time when he’d broken up with me and we got back together. We had a joint car which needed repairs done too but he purchased the bike and paid a lot in insurance, tax and repairs in that one. He sold it around 2 months later. 

3. The third bike he owned he favoured over putting our money together and buying a joint car. He used to specifically spend time without me because I no longer wish to be a passenger (see point 4) and he used to sneak around, lie about his whereabouts and who he was seeing. 

4. We had an accident which was not his fault, and I was badly injured and couldn’t walk for 2-3 months. I still have many scars and it was a traumatic experience which involved me being taken to hospital and told we could’ve died, we were also in another country on vacation when this happened and it was my birthday so overall, a pretty chaotic and horrible memory. 

I said that not only do we need our finances to pool together for our future but there’s many safety aspects too. I know people who have sadly passed from accidents and left their young children and wives broken hearted. My boyfriend claims this is his hobby and he’s allowed to be an individual, which I agree but I just feel like with all the reasons above, it’s a bit mean to not relate to why I feel this way. I jokingly but kinda seriously told him I’d buy him a bike for his 45th birthday (we’re about 20 years off that mark,) but I feel like he wasn’t listening to all the negativity around this for me.

89,1f3xhw6,AITA— for wanting my sister out?,"Okay, I’ll try to make this post very quick and to the point to avoid a long read.
In April, my sister (29F) went through a financial which caused her to lose her apartment. She asked me could she stay with me (25F) for about two weeks, until she was able to find something else.
I’ve allowed her to save all of her money, just so she can have more than enough money to be able to move during that time span. It’s now almost September and she’s still in my 2 bedroom apartment which consists of me and my daughter. Keep in mind I’m almost 6 months pregnant, dealing with the stress another able bodied adult is bringing in. She has a full time job yet, doesn’t help out on any bills, any household needs, doesn’t keep the house up to part— it’s literally been a nightmare.
With everything built up, I asked her to move out in early August, and I’ll give her until the end of August to do so. Here we are, at the end of August, and she hasn’t found anything. Every time I ask her about a lease, it’s an excuse to why she hasn’t found one, or she “finds”one, the move in date comes and she doesn’t move, she’s still in my space saying “oh i found something cheaper so I’ll do a lease there”. I feel I’ve made her so comfortable, she feels entitled to continue to stay in my home. My mom who believes because this is my sister, makes me feel guilty about me saying I was going to pack her things and have them ready for her to move out but doesn’t want her to move back home with her either. She then creates a narrative, that I want her out so bad so I could move my child’s father in, because I expressed to her how I don’t see him often due to my sister being here, and it feels over crammed when so many people are in my small space here.. which truly isn’t the case, I’m just really ready for my own space back. And even if that was the case, why should it matter when this is my home that I pay every bill at with no contribution? 

Nevertheless,
What do I do in this situation? I don’t want to be “the asshole”, but I’m very overwhelmed, overstimulated, and stressed. I never knew asking someone to leave your home could be such a hard task, especially when you’ve voiced to them on numerous occasions their causing you major stress during your pregnancy and that you think you guys should split ways.",Not the A-hole,2024-08-29,"AITA— for wanting my sister out?

90,1f3xfun,AITA for not explaining my GF how to do the laundry?,"Hi everyone,
I desperately need some third opinions about this conflict my gf (f26) and I (f26) had yesterday. I feel like I am losing my mind and I don’t know if I am in the wrong or not.
Before we met, my gf didn’t separate the laundry at all and just washed white/black/colourful stuff all together. 
We now basically spend 90% of out time at her place which is why most of my clothes are there as well and subsequently end up in the laundry there. I told her I am not comfortable washing everything together and that I don’t mind taking over the laundry part, which is why I have been doing the laundry for almost 1 year now. I separate light, dark/colourful and bedsheets / towels and wool or other delicates.
I now started a full time job while still weiting my master’s thesis whereas she got laid off her job. I am extremely busy and a bit overwhelmed with everything. She then said she could do the laundry this time as she is home all day and I was very thankful for it. 
We have all laundry mixed together in one dirty basket and I separate things by hand directly before washing a load. 
She texted me yesterday after doing a dark/colourful load that a red sweater of mine that was in the basket ruined the white seam of her favourite new pair of black undies, which is now pink. She basically said that I should’ve given her the instruction to NOT wash the red sweater with the undies and that it is my fault that they are ruined and she has to get another pack of them. I should have told her that the sweater could’ve stained the undies. She was being very rude and not very respectful in her communication, basically called me a child and said that I never take responsibility for anything that is my fault. We got into a very big fight about this seemingly miniscule thing and I was trying desperately to defend myself but she couldn’t see my side at all.
My arguments that I was trying to make were:
1. I did not know that the sweater would stain, I washed it before on a delicate cycle with other things and everything was fine. Also I forgot that it was even in there because I wanted to wash it by hand as it is made from a delicate material which is why it was at the total bottom of the basket.
2. She said herself that she wanted to wash these undies by hand as she wants the seam with the logo to stay white, which means she understands the risks of putting it into a dark/colourful load
3. The load was not sorted by me beforehand, and imho, being 26 years old, you should know to think about laundry strategically, meaning knowing what mixes well and what doesn’t, and if you do the laundry it‘s your responsibility to make sure that you only put compatible things into a load.

She did not take this very well and is 100% convinced that I am in the wrong and responsible and made some very strange and hurtful comments to me. I am starting to doubt myself and am panicking that I am really in the wrong. So reddit please tell me, AITA?

EDIT: just to give you a bit more context, we have recently had a couple of diagreements where she blamed me for things that were not in my control, e.g. when the toilet flush broke after making some issues for a while, while I was home alone. I told her that it is normal for these things to wear down after a while whereas she told me that it is my responsibility because I pressed the flush and then it didn’t work anymore. This issue was fixed though but i was still a little hurt. 

EDIT: to all the people saying they never separate laundry: I mean good that it works for you and even if my way is overly complicated and unnecessary, how is that relevant for this conflict? If we had the rule just to wash everything together like my gf did before, the sweater would have still stained the undie. In that case, I still don’t see how it would be my fault, because then we would have had an even stronger mutual understanding that this sweater shouldn’t bleed. How could I have known that exactly this thing would cause any issues?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-29,"AITA for not explaining my GF how to do the laundry? Hi everyone,
I desperately need some third opinions about this conflict my gf (f26) and I (f26) had yesterday. I feel like I am losing my mind and I don’t know if I am in the wrong or not.
Before we met, my gf didn’t separate the laundry at all and just washed white/black/colourful stuff all together. 
We now basically spend 90% of out time at her place which is why most of my clothes are there as well and subsequently end up in the laundry there. I told her I am not comfortable washing everything together and that I don’t mind taking over the laundry part, which is why I have been doing the laundry for almost 1 year now. I separate light, dark/colourful and bedsheets / towels and wool or other delicates.
I now started a full time job while still weiting my master’s thesis whereas she got laid off her job. I am extremely busy and a bit overwhelmed with everything. She then said she could do the laundry this time as she is home all day and I was very thankful for it. 
We have all laundry mixed together in one dirty basket and I separate things by hand directly before washing a load. 
She texted me yesterday after doing a dark/colourful load that a red sweater of mine that was in the basket ruined the white seam of her favourite new pair of black undies, which is now pink. She basically said that I should’ve given her the instruction to NOT wash the red sweater with the undies and that it is my fault that they are ruined and she has to get another pack of them. I should have told her that the sweater could’ve stained the undies. She was being very rude and not very respectful in her communication, basically called me a child and said that I never take responsibility for anything that is my fault. We got into a very big fight about this seemingly miniscule thing and I was trying desperately to defend myself but she couldn’t see my side at all.
My arguments that I was trying to make were:
1. I did not know that the sweater would stain, I washed it before on a delicate cycle with other things and everything was fine. Also I forgot that it was even in there because I wanted to wash it by hand as it is made from a delicate material which is why it was at the total bottom of the basket.
2. She said herself that she wanted to wash these undies by hand as she wants the seam with the logo to stay white, which means she understands the risks of putting it into a dark/colourful load
3. The load was not sorted by me beforehand, and imho, being 26 years old, you should know to think about laundry strategically, meaning knowing what mixes well and what doesn’t, and if you do the laundry it‘s your responsibility to make sure that you only put compatible things into a load.

She did not take this very well and is 100% convinced that I am in the wrong and responsible and made some very strange and hurtful comments to me. I am starting to doubt myself and am panicking that I am really in the wrong. So reddit please tell me, AITA?

EDIT: just to give you a bit more context, we have recently had a couple of diagreements where she blamed me for things that were not in my control, e.g. when the toilet flush broke after making some issues for a while, while I was home alone. I told her that it is normal for these things to wear down after a while whereas she told me that it is my responsibility because I pressed the flush and then it didn’t work anymore. This issue was fixed though but i was still a little hurt. 

EDIT: to all the people saying they never separate laundry: I mean good that it works for you and even if my way is overly complicated and unnecessary, how is that relevant for this conflict? If we had the rule just to wash everything together like my gf did before, the sweater would have still stained the undie. In that case, I still don’t see how it would be my fault, because then we would have had an even stronger mutual understanding that this sweater shouldn’t bleed. How could I have known that exactly this thing would cause any issues?",0.0,0.845003604888916,1,0

I work a very stressful job as a special education teacher working with severe needs kids and the leader of 5 adults in my room. I am a long time headache/migraine sufferer and take a shot every month to prevent them as well as prescription meds when needed.

 My boyfriend worked a lucrative job with terrible hours but quit over 2 years ago and has lived off his savings since then. He has not worked at all since then. He does nice things for me like running some of my errands when i ask and fixing my lunch and dinner most of the time. I thank him often for this and do things to show i care as well like offering to get him food or pick up something on the way home. He often seems resentful of me bringing up that he helps me “with everything” even though it’s usually just cooking and a couple household chores. 

He is currently pursuing an insurance job and i even helped him with the application even though ive had a full blown migraine the last few days and stayed home from work Monday due to this. He was nice the first day i was home but got angry when i asked if he would drive me and pick me up Tuesday from work since i was still in a lot of pain.

He complained about fixing my lunches and running all my errands (again this week he made 2 stops total only on Monday less than 10 minutes from the apartment).

96,1f3vs2c,AITA for demanding my friend to apologize?,"I (16 F) have a work friend group, the only one important in this story is my friend, who for this post I’ll call Anna (19 F). Anna decided to invite a few of us to the state fair and I was one of them.

While there Anna ran around with a friend, who me and my coworker didn’t know, and just went on rides with them. I decided to let her have fun and go get something to eat while my coworker followed cause he didn’t know what else to do.

Before hand, Anna told us we’d be back around 6 and it was already 3. So me and my coworker went on a few rides to pass the time. Eventually it hit 5 and we were ready to go as both of our curfews were approaching. I texted Anna asking where she is and she didn’t reply. I assumed she was on a ride so waited 5 minutes. After that I texted her and she again didn’t reply so I called her. After almost 7 times of calling her and trying to figure out where she is, she answers my text saying “i’m not even with them are you guys dumb?” I got a bit annoyed at her words and just ignored it. We find the rest of the group and hang out with them for a bit.

Eventually 6 hits and my coworker’s curfew is 6:30 and it already an hour drive back home. So we ask her boyfriend, who drove us, if he can drop us off and come back for them so we don’t get in trouble. Anna’s friend rode with us so we asked her if we could leave and she said no. I rolled my eyes but just delt with it.

It then hits 8 and we’re both past our curfew so we ask to leave again. By then Anna pops up after 2 hours, talking about the concert she went to. Me and my coworker try to leave but Anna and her friend go and hop on a few rides and get food. We don’t leave till 8.

After we got dropped off, at 10 so we were both in trouble, I was texted Anna explaining how it felt like she didn’t acknowledge us at the fair after inviting us and how she’d kinda hurt my feelings calling me dumb. I wanted to keep it between us but she went and posted it on Insta.

I told her I was just asking for an apology and she said “why should I have to apologize when I did nothing wrong?” This is the part where I may be the asshole. I snapped and told her until she apologizes I’ll be staying home.

So AITA?

Edit: so I texted Anna, telling her my point of view on how that day went. She then started to say bad things about me to another coworker. I found out cause of the coworker I went to the fair with. I then told her I’m quitting cause I don’t want to work with people that say bad things when said person isn’t there to defend themselves.

99,1f3v6ii,AITA for sending a video to my sister in law to prove a point to my wife? ,"To set some context, I think my wife can be a negative person sometimes, especially when it comes to me doing things around the house.

For example, our bedroom was in a terrible way. Lining paper on the ceiling falling off, rotten windows, damaged floors etc. I saved for over 6 months and got someone to completely rip it out and refurbish it. Her first response? ""I really don't like the light, should have got something else"".

Our children's room was in a not dissimilar situation. The hallway was also a mess and we literally had a hole in a wall. I ripped everything out myself but we had an issue with the decorators so a 1 week job turned into 6 weeks. Children had to be in our room and the whole time she was moaning. When it was finished (a million times better and more practical), she would say comments about how I should had waited for the kids to get older as they're just going to mess things up. No positive comments, but when her friends or family came over and praised the work (even a 6 year old child who commented ""this is so cool"", referring to our children's room) she was quick to give them a tour and show everything off like the standing desk and smart lights.

Recently, I purchased some strip lights to put under the bed in our bedroom. Aesthetic reasons yes, but mainly it was for when one of us got up at night, we didn't have to turn on the lamps which will disturb the other. I hooked up a sensor so when you get out of bed, lights under the bed will turn on so you can easily see where you are going without lighting up the room. Turns off automatically after a minute too.

Wife sees me me putting this on the bed. First comment? ""what have you purchased now? Why is this necessary?"" I basically repeat the previous paragraph. ""it's not that deep, I'm sure we'll be fine without it"".

There a WhatsApp group that includes my wife, her sister and me. We regularly chat in it, send pictures of kids etc. I sent a video and picture of the bed. I thought it all looked quite cool, wanted to show it off to others after not getting a great response from my wife, but also wanted to highlight (I didn't point it out to her or let my intentions known) to my wife the difference in response.

How did the sister respond? ""this is so cool and it looks amazing! How do I get his?"" Followed up by a couple other questions.

We didn't explicitly discuss it, but it was clear my wife wasn't impressed. After my wife saw me putting it on and made her initial negative comments, I brought up a YouTube video I saw where the wife mentions first thing that her husband is a genius and shows the work he's done in the house. I mentioned how all the comments were full of people being more impressed by the wife praising her husband than the actual work he did.

Am I an ass hole? ",Not enough info,2024-08-29,"AITA for sending a video to my sister in law to prove a point to my wife?  To set some context, I think my wife can be a negative person sometimes, especially when it comes to me doing things around the house.

For example, our bedroom was in a terrible way. Lining paper on the ceiling falling off, rotten windows, damaged floors etc. I saved for over 6 months and got someone to completely rip it out and refurbish it. Her first response? ""I really don't like the light, should have got something else"".

Our children's room was in a not dissimilar situation. The hallway was also a mess and we literally had a hole in a wall. I ripped everything out myself but we had an issue with the decorators so a 1 week job turned into 6 weeks. Children had to be in our room and the whole time she was moaning. When it was finished (a million times better and more practical), she would say comments about how I should had waited for the kids to get older as they're just going to mess things up. No positive comments, but when her friends or family came over and praised the work (even a 6 year old child who commented ""this is so cool"", referring to our children's room) she was quick to give them a tour and show everything off like the standing desk and smart lights.

Recently, I purchased some strip lights to put under the bed in our bedroom. Aesthetic reasons yes, but mainly it was for when one of us got up at night, we didn't have to turn on the lamps which will disturb the other. I hooked up a sensor so when you get out of bed, lights under the bed will turn on so you can easily see where you are going without lighting up the room. Turns off automatically after a minute too.

Wife sees me me putting this on the bed. First comment? ""what have you purchased now? Why is this necessary?"" I basically repeat the previous paragraph. ""it's not that deep, I'm sure we'll be fine without it"".

There a WhatsApp group that includes my wife, her sister and me. We regularly chat in it, send pictures of kids etc. I sent a video and picture of the bed. I thought it all looked quite cool, wanted to show it off to others after not getting a great response from my wife, but also wanted to highlight (I didn't point it out to her or let my intentions known) to my wife the difference in response.

How did the sister respond? ""this is so cool and it looks amazing! How do I get his?"" Followed up by a couple other questions.

We didn't explicitly discuss it, but it was clear my wife wasn't impressed. After my wife saw me putting it on and made her initial negative comments, I brought up a YouTube video I saw where the wife mentions first thing that her husband is a genius and shows the work he's done in the house. I mentioned how all the comments were full of people being more impressed by the wife praising her husband than the actual work he did.

101,1f3v14s,AITA for moving out on my room mates ,"I live with two other female roommates. my first room mate dropped a bomb that she was just up and leaving us with the lease. I been through this before having room mates and both up and left me with the lease I am also the main person on the lease and all utilities and wifi. I also own 95% of everything in this apartment. Naturally I got upset and questioned her. My second room mate didn't seem to understand how serious that was. There was no communication no anything it was just hey guys I'm moving out and I'm leaving at the end of the week. She also expected us to cover her rent or find her replacement. 

On my end I was not about to get screwed over again. Second room mate I guess decided that this would be her opportunity to leave. After some stress and drama neither of them decided to leave. It's been a few weeks since. During this time it feels like it's them two against me. They don't go out of their rooms if I'm in the apartment. They don't talk to me.

There has just been petty little issues. I haven't been talking to either of them because of their behaviour towards me. I always helped either of them when they needed someone, or rides, or offer money. I don’t trust either of them now. My friend confirmed they are talking behind my back. My last straw was today with a situation about my dog. 
I've already got a few potential female room mates lined up to replace me.All that is left to do is sign myself off of the lease. I never wanted to be a hypocrite tho. 

I've really felt like these two have walked all over me after everything I did to get us this apartment. Now the treatment towards me is making the environment stressful.

103,1f3ugp2,AITA for not making my mom a butter block?,"I'm 24F and my mom is 46F. We're just like any other mother-daughter duo out there, I guess you can say, butting heads constantly and then being fine with each other a day later. Normally when she doesn't get her way, she's passive-aggressive about it and goes out of her way to remind me that I disappointed her, but I've desensitized myself to it over these past few years, which she hates.

My mom drinks often, but never to the point of getting drunk because she can handle her liquor. (She normally drinks enough to get tipsy, but not enough to get drunk. When she's tipsy she's just blunt about everything.) When she *does* get drunk and we're both home, she demands I do something for her, more often than not to get in the kitchen and make her something to eat. I'll admit I'm pretty intolerant toward her when she's like this specifically because she always asks me in her ""pretty please"" voice, like she knows I won't say no to her. It annoys me more than when she's sober sometimes.

Recently, she's gotten into a baking phase (food, not weed). Our house is almost never without sourdough and other breads now, and part of that is because she has *me* help her make the doughs in the first place; I used to be the sole baker in the family—mainly sweets and easier breads like focaccia and no-knead boules, but never sourdough—so this has been one of the only ways we've been able to bond these past couple months. Her newest obsession is making croissants because she found a recipe that simplifies the process, and the first time she made them the batch turned out pretty good.

These two aspects of our life collided earlier tonight (9PM), when she came home drunk and checked on the croissant doughs she made earlier. After that she asked me to make a butter block (literally some softened butter rolled into an 8x8 square and hardened in the fridge) so she can make croissants tomorrow morning. I had arrived home from school a little over an hour before this point (just before 8PM), so I was tired and told her to do it herself. She kept badgering me about it, so I ignored her and went to take a shower. I even told my dad to help her instead, but she said she only wanted *my* help.

It pissed me off because it's very rare for her to help me when I'm doing something in the kitchen. She doesn't offer, and when I do ask for help she usually says she's busy and tells my dad or brother to do it instead, if not ignore me. She has this rule where if she cooks then the rest of us clean, which is fine, except when I cook I'm expected to clean everything myself too.

When it was clear I wasn't going to help her, I overheard her slamming cabinet doors and kitchen drawers as she prepared to make the butter block herself. I'm expecting her to either ignore me tomorrow morning or say I'm not allowed any croissants since I didn't help.

I'm pretty sure I'm TA here, or maybe we both suck, but I just want to be sure.

104,1f3uev1,AITA for not allowing my son to play video games?,"I have a 12-year-old son, Kyle, who's in 7th grade. Kyle was diagnosed as autistic at age 4. School has always been difficult for him; he has a lot of behavioral challenges, no friends whom he hangs out with outside school, and prefers solitary activities. He doesn't seem bothered by his lack of friends and gets annoyed when we push him to be more social. He gets along fine with adults but not other kids, and he says they don't understand and make fun of him.

When he started 2nd grade, my husband and I, after consulting with his IEP team, came to the agreement that we would homeschool Kyle for most of the school day while we look for a school that can meet his needs. This was meant to be a temporary solution that would hopefully have taken a couple of months while we looked for a school, but it's taken a lot longer because the school district refuses to send him to the program that we feel would be the best fit for him.

In the meantime, at the urging of his pediatrician, we have had Kyle attend social skills group therapy. He's always hated these groups, and complains that the other kids in the group are constantly talking about video games and he feels left out. He has asked us if we will allow him to get a gaming console. We have said no.

This has been an issue since we began homeschooling him but in recent months he seems to be increasingly insisting that we let him get a gaming console. He's said that all the kids are constantly talking about video games and he feels left out. We've suggested that he try to share stuff that he's interested in, but he says the other kids either ignore or make fun of him, which makes him not want to hang out with them. The rest of the time however, he complains that he hates the social skills groups because they make him anxious and distract him from his homework.

I didn't play video games growing up and there are many reasons why I don’t think it’s a good idea. I get motion sick very easily and am assuming he will get motion sick too, I’ve heard they’re addictive, and there are so many games that are inappropriate for kids his age. I also feel that there are so many other ways he could bond with his peers, and I hear so much about all the negative effects gaming has on kids.

I thought his therapist would understand, however, she told us that as long as we put strict rules in place (i.e. no playing for longer than 30 minutes per day, he must get 1 hour of exercise, must finish all his homework, and not complain about going to group), we should let him play. My husband thinks this is reasonable, but I am not on board.

I wasn’t planning on telling Kyle that his therapist and my husband think I should let him play, but somehow he found out. Now he thinks I'm being ""mean"" and refuses to talk to me. AITA?

However, 1st day in Betty already seemed unorganized. She didn’t have schedules, tuition payment, credit card figured out and I helped her make phone calls. She also seemed very introverted and was pretty quiet when we made small talk. I felt that our personalities didn’t exactly match either. Everytime we held a conversation, it would be me asking questions and her answering. My roommate friend, Kelly, was also similar as she was also quite introverted and didn’t make much friends in high schools. But since we were already friendly since young, we would carry the conversation and it was comfortable enough. 

After a few days, class started and I opted to socialize with people outside of my roommates since I’ve been with them 24/7 since I moved in. Plus, it’s college!

Betty would text our groupchat for lunch or dinner together everyday.

107,1f3tum6,AITA for the gift I have my friends girlfriend," I (male 27) have been friends with Bailey (female 25) for 13 years. 3 years ago Bailey started dating Lauren (female 26). I typically hangout with Bailey once or twice a week and Lauren normally comes because they don’t hangout without each other. Lauren and I have spent a lot of time together but we’ve never become close, always curtious to each other though. The past two years as Lauren and Baileys relationship has gotten more serious I’ve invited Lauren to my birthday celebration and in return I’ve gone to a couple of Lauren’s birthday celebrations. When I go to friends birthdays I bring a gift in the $80 range and I spent around this for Lauren until this year. 

Something I’ve noticed with Lauren is for my birthday the gift she gives is an art project she did for school in highscholl that she pulls out of storage. I’ve seen Lauren go above and beyond to find gifts for mutual friends and Baileys birthdays.

This year for Lauren’s birthday instead of buying her a gift I collected rocks and painted them with her favorite Disney characters for her to put in her garden. I did this because I was tired of putting the time and money into buying gifts and feeling like it was never reciprocated. When she opened my gift she was clearly disappointed and said “you gave me a box of rocks?” I explained they’re for her garden and she says “people normally give real gifts for birthdays, not craft projects”. I pointed out the last two years for my birthday she had gifted me her old highschool art projects. She told me that was completely different because those were works of art and this is a craft project.

AITA for gifting my friends girlfriend painted rocks for her birthday? ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-29,"AITA for the gift I have my friends girlfriend  I (male 27) have been friends with Bailey (female 25) for 13 years. 3 years ago Bailey started dating Lauren (female 26). I typically hangout with Bailey once or twice a week and Lauren normally comes because they don’t hangout without each other. Lauren and I have spent a lot of time together but we’ve never become close, always curtious to each other though. The past two years as Lauren and Baileys relationship has gotten more serious I’ve invited Lauren to my birthday celebration and in return I’ve gone to a couple of Lauren’s birthday celebrations. When I go to friends birthdays I bring a gift in the $80 range and I spent around this for Lauren until this year. 

Something I’ve noticed with Lauren is for my birthday the gift she gives is an art project she did for school in highscholl that she pulls out of storage. I’ve seen Lauren go above and beyond to find gifts for mutual friends and Baileys birthdays.

This year for Lauren’s birthday instead of buying her a gift I collected rocks and painted them with her favorite Disney characters for her to put in her garden. I did this because I was tired of putting the time and money into buying gifts and feeling like it was never reciprocated. When she opened my gift she was clearly disappointed and said “you gave me a box of rocks?” I explained they’re for her garden and she says “people normally give real gifts for birthdays, not craft projects”.

108,1f3trfh,AITA for getting aggravated at my boyfriend for not complimenting me anymore,"I (18 f) and my boyfriend (19 m)(I’ll refer to as boyfriend) have been dating for two years. When we first started dating, it was as blissful as a new relationship could be. We were happy, complimenting each other, calling one another pet names, meeting the family’s, everything was going well. We had our fights as teenage couples do. I won’t claim it’s been perfect.

About 3 weeks ago, I noticed him being very distant over text for a few days so I asked him what was wrong. He kept saying nothing so I pushed a bit more and he went off. He said that I don’t care about him as an individual person and only as a partner. In the argument I said that I feel he doesn’t care about me as a partner. It was a rough fight lasting multiple days and we almost broke up. Since then it has been a bit strained. I fear of touching him and bothering him. I try so hard to not bombard him and take up his space to give him space to “be his own person”. 

But within that time, he stopped complimenting me. It must’ve been days before that fight that he last complimented me in any way. For context, we would compliment each other at least 4 times a day before this. It has become so harsh to get nothing from him. So I asked him if he could, I told him it hurts and it makes it feel like even more that he doesn’t care about me. In reply he told me “idk, I can try” which hurt. With still no compliments tonight, I asked him why and he said again “idk” I told him how it hurt and he just went quiet, didn’t say a word. I asked if he was comparing me to someone else and that’s why he won’t compliment me and he said no but nothing else on the matter. He then went to bed and left me there crying and hurt.

My brother (29) has had a room and my sisters 25 and 27 have shared a room forever.And then there’s me. I have had to basically couch surf around my house. I’ve slept on couches. BeforeI slept in the same room as my sisters till I was around 10ish I think and before that it was my parents when I was 6-8. (guess). Starting middle school I got two twin mattresses put on top of each other in our basement. I basically just stayed in the basement all day just rotting playing video games. Most of my stuff would just be laying around the basement and I’d use my parents closet to hang my clothes. In the past 3 years my double decker twin mattress got upgraded as my sister bought a new bed set and it was a huge step up as I now got a queen sized mattress on a futon frame and I loved itLast year I was able to get my current room. I have to mention though, that all the previous years I’ve slept outside this room was occupied by my late Grandma who passed away last year. The months after her death and the grief my dad cleared out all the old furniture and gave me his entire bedroom set for my new room as he bought a new one. This included a huge dresser, a bed frame that properly fit my big mattress, A REAL big closet so my clothes weren’t all stuffed in my parents tiny closet and a desk to do my work Needless to say I LOVE this arrangement.

i (23f) have been with my boyfriend (25m) for 5 years. we met soon after i turned 18 and we immediately connected and got very close very quickly. 

the past year or so has been rough. he'd quit at least 3 different jobs, leaving me to pay the bills. because of his lack of income we had to move out of our shared apartment and back in with this dad. we've been living with his dad for over a year at this point.

i've been feeling resentful because of how hard i work to maintain my work life balance, and seeing him do basically nothing all the time while i bust my ass day in and day out to try to better myself makes me question what i'm doing. 

the other day i made a post for his birthday. it was a sweet post with old pictures and i genuinely had good intentions. he just ""liked"" it, no comment or anything. i mentioned that he didn't comment to him and he just commented a heart emoji. it felt kind of shitty that i tried to make a thoughtful post and he didn't even seem to care. he said he thinks social media ""declarations of love"" are ""cringey"" but i could post it ""if i wanted to."" i mentioned his comment was kind of weak and he said ""ok, ill just delete it then."" he said if i didn't appreciate the response he gave he wouldn't comment at all. i got irritated but he moved past it.

today i had a really long day and i came home late to find he hadn't done some things he said he would do. this aggravated me and i was in a bad mood, just generally because of everything that had happened over the past few days. he asked me if everything was ok and i didn't want to get into it because i didn't want to argue, and i also didn't really know exactly WHY i was annoyed, i just knew i was.

so i thought about it and asked him if he wanted to know why i was irritated. i brought up the post i made and his comment and the fact he said he would delete it if i didnt ""appreciate it"". he got mad and told me im self serving and i need to grow up. this made me snap and i said, ""I need to grow up? i've had to pay your bills for the last 3 times you were unemployed. how about you get a job and move out of your fucking dad's house, fucking baby."" he told me i would regret saying that, and i said i didn't care. 

now he refuses to talk to me and told me to leave. i get what i said was probably out of order, however ive genuinely put up with so much in the past year it just feels like a slap in the face to tell ME to grow up when i feel like im the only one holding everything down, and he can't even try to understand why i feel the way i do.

","I'm a 27F from Johannesburg, South Africa. My fiancé, Will (27M), is American. We met in 2018 during my MSc (Master of Science) in England. We dated briefly but lost touch after. In 2021, he reconnected with me via Instagram, and our relationship blossomed. He’s visited South Africa a few times, and I’ve visited him in New York once. In May 2024, he proposed to me during a visit to Johannesburg, and I happily accepted.

Recently, I got time off work and visited him in New York again. We also planned a trip to Atlanta to meet his family, whom I hadn’t met before. I was excited but nervous. At first, everything seemed fine—his family welcomed me with a big dinner. However, his mother and aunt made some stereotypical and uneducated comments about South Africa, which I found amusing but also slightly irritating. They kept asking why I sounded British and even compared me to Hermione from Harry Potter. Then, his mother said, ""I’m honestly wondering how you’re South African if you’re not black. I didn’t even know there were white people in South Africa!""

As a naturally witty and sarcastic person, I responded without thinking, saying something like, “Yeah, we just magically appeared there one day, like poof!” In hindsight, I can see how this might have been the wrong approach, but it was my immediate reaction. His mother and aunt were clearly offended, and the evening became awkward.

Will noticed the tension and got upset. When he drove me back to my hotel, he started ranting about how disrespectful I was to his mother and aunt. He talked about how important respect is in his family and didn’t let me explain. I apologised, still confused because I didn’t think much of my comment at the time—it was meant to be lighthearted. However, Will raised his voice, expressing his disappointment and saying we’d talk about it later. Since then, he hasn’t responded to my messages or come back to the hotel to speak to me.

115,1f3rvd4,AITA for giving my BIL notice to vacate? ,"My (m30) BIL (m44) has been unemployed for over a year and a half and lost his rental back in May, so my wife (m32)(his sister) and I let him move in with the stipulation that he would get a (any) job within two months. We almost immediately regretted the decision. His dog bit our cat and dog within the first 2 weeks because he doesn't train her; honestly, he basically ignores her all day. He always creates a disaster in the kitchen and then has cleaned the kitchen maybe 10 times in the last 3 months and normally only when we ask. 

Hes also an alcoholic, he drinks half a dozen beers a day every single day. He also takes a bunch of psychiatric meds and THC. Finally, he hasnt found a job; he entered a 15 week coding bootcamp so he could force us to let him stay longer. He literally cried crocodile tears to beg us to let him stay 6 months. Otherwise, he just plays video games all day and night. *HE IS 44 BY THE WAY*

He's even asked me to apply for jobs for him (I told him I would help him revise his resume and send him a couple listings, but he had to apply himself). He's also refused to do gig work, or work retail/food service jobs. His resume is a turd; he's gotten fired or laid from 6 jobs in 8 years, usually because of behavioral issues.  He's got AuDHD, anxiety, etc. and his brothers think narcissism, but they all hate each other, so idk. 

Last weekend, freaked the fuck out on my wife for asking him to *checks notes* clean a pan after she spent a bunch of time cleaning the kitchen and he made a mess almost immediately after. Since then, he's been sending her walls of texts with demands not to contact him if she was just ""going to nag him"" and called her controlling and a micromanager. I put my foot down and gave him his notice. He signed a week to week lease with us so he has to be out soon or I'm going to file for ejectment. My wife wants him out too, but feels guilty, since he was going to be homeless back in May if we didn't let him move in.

My (m30) BIL (m44) has been unemployed for over a year and a half and lost his rental back in May, so my wife (m32)(his sister) and I let him move in with the stipulation that he would get a (any) job within two months. We almost immediately regretted the decision. His dog bit our cat and dog within the first 2 weeks because he doesn't train her; honestly, he basically ignores her all day. He always creates a disaster in the kitchen and then has cleaned the kitchen maybe 10 times in the last 3 months and normally only when we ask. 

Hes also an alcoholic, he drinks half a dozen beers a day every single day. He also takes a bunch of psychiatric meds and THC. Finally, he hasnt found a job; he entered a 15 week coding bootcamp so he could force us to let him stay longer. He literally cried crocodile tears to beg us to let him stay 6 months. Otherwise, he just plays video games all day and night. *HE IS 44 BY THE WAY*

He's even asked me to apply for jobs for him (I told him I would help him revise his resume and send him a couple listings, but he had to apply himself). He's also refused to do gig work, or work retail/food service jobs. His resume is a turd; he's gotten fired or laid from 6 jobs in 8 years, usually because of behavioral issues.  He's got AuDHD, anxiety, etc. and his brothers think narcissism, but they all hate each other, so idk. 

Last weekend, freaked the fuck out on my wife for asking him to *checks notes* clean a pan after she spent a bunch of time cleaning the kitchen and he made a mess almost immediately after. Since then, he's been sending her walls of texts with demands not to contact him if she was just ""going to nag him"" and called her controlling and a micromanager. I put my foot down and gave him his notice. He signed a week to week lease with us so he has to be out soon or I'm going to file for ejectment.

116,1f3rsy1,AITA for asking my roommate to keep it down after a certain hour of the night?,"Hey! So I'm a college student and am staying at an apartment with 3 other roommates. One of them just moved in and was struggling making friends as a transfer student. Well now they have a group of friends and I am genuinely happy for them! The issue is, they seem to be starting to have them over every single night after 9pm? (As in, they come at 9pm and stay until midnight. The semester is just starting so I can't know for certain).

Which wouldn't be an issue but I have a very hectic schedule and lots of assignments to complete that I can only do at night. And I also have Auditory Processing Disorder plus ADHD which makes it impossible for me to concentrate in certain situations.
Specially when they tend to be screaming so loud I can hear every word they say over my headphones playing music/white noise.  And yesterday they went on until 12:30am like this.
(And I couldn't read a few papers that were due today but I didn't say anything bc I didn't want to bother them). 
And today I was startled? By suddenly coming out of the bathroom and seeing them all there again without knowing they were coming.

Well today, I sent a text asking as nicely as possible if it would be possible to keep it down after a certain time such as after 11pm. Not whisper or anything, they can still talk and have fun and hang out, just not screaming and laughin at the top of their lungs. AND to give me a heads uo of when they wouod be over so I wouldn't suddenly catch a bunch of people over there out of nowhere. 

Immdediately after I sent this text, they agreed nicely but everyone started whispering as if I had chastized them for being loud and left the aparment almost as if I kicked them out. Even though I clarified I was just hoping they could keep it down after a certain hour (like an hour from now), and didn't have to whisper.

Now I feel like a buzzkill and an asshole? I didn't mean to kick them out or to ruin their fun night and make them feel unwelcome here. Like, my roommate is also paying rent and should be allowed to have people over! Also we ARE college students, being loud and having fun comes with the territorty! Also I could theoretically go to the library to study (that's what they said they'd do if I was ever being loud) but it's quite late and often closed by now. I also had a roommate with sensory issues and serious control issues and we were never allowed to make any noise (real or imaginary) so I know how that can be a pain in the butt.  And obviously I'd also love to be able to have people over ocasionally!

117,1f3ro8a,AITA For Telling My Mom That My Step Dad Was Being Rude?,"I (20 F), my mom (50), and my step dad (55) were having dinner with my grandparents. I was not really having the best day because one of my college roommates was being very difficult and just making everything stressful for me as they wanted to buy a griddle, bring their two rice cookers, and a toaster oven into a suite dorm. 

Our dorms are very sensitive to smoke since the school is smoke, drug, and alcohol free. I was stressing about where are we going to hide these very large items when room checks happen and the possibility of them accidentally burning food, causing the smoke alarms in the ENTIRE dorm building to go off. 

I was dealing with this all day during work (as I am home for the summer) and I just wanted to vent about it to my family. I asked my family if it was okay to talk about the situation and they said yes. 

As I was venting to my nana (and to anyone else that was listening), my step father would then constantly interrupt me as I was venting. He would either make a joke, mock what I said, or interrupt me just for the fun of it. 

I was getting frustrated because not only that, my mother would also provoke the behavior by laughing at his “jokes” and sighing really loud when I kept talking. I felt like at this point, no one was really listening to me, so I just ended my vent there and gave up. As we were helping my nana clean the dishes, I told her thank you for listening to me, even though my step father was being quite rude (my step dad left to go home so he didn’t hear my comment). 

Once the dishes were done, my mom and I walked outside to head home and then she began to get onto me, telling me my step dad was just trying to “cheer me up”. While I understood where she was coming from, I told her there is a time and a place to make jokes and this wasn’t one of them. I needed someone, mainly my parents, to listen to me and to respect that I didn’t want someone making jokes when I am venting. 

She got really upset and started to bring up the fact that he does everything for us and that he does listen to me. I told her while, again, I understood that he does do a lot of things (like paying the bills, providing insurance, etc), it was still very rude and disrespectful to not listen to me and to mock me. She then got even more upset and said that she will tell him to not make jokes to me anymore and she is sorry that “I feel that way about him”. 

As we continued to argue, I began to cry a little as I just wanted someone to sit down and listen to me. That was all I was asking, just for someone to not interrupt me every minute to make a joke about my frustrations. She then got mad once more, stating that it was my fault to begin with for letting this situation bother me all day and letting it make me stressed. To end the conversation, she asked where her chicken was and I pointed the direction I last saw it and we both went our separate ways.

118,1f3r2y1,"AITA: Son damaged my car, doesn't want to fix it, wife agrees with son","First, a little backstory. Throwaway because of reasons. 

I, 46M, have a son, 19M, who attends University in a city about an hour away. I pay his rent, all his tuition, his meals, everything. 

This summer he almost exclusively used my car. I think I drove it once a month

A month ago, he scratched the bumper of the car pulling into the garage. Weeks later he decided he'd do something to fix it. I didn't hound him on it, I left it with him. He apparently googled that rubbing toothpaste would remove the scratches, so he did that. It removed some, but also took the clear coat off. Not a big deal, it's a bumper. That's not the part that I'm here for. 

The car was dirty, so he decided to wash it in the driveway, instead of going to the coin car wash. Some of the caked on clay on the drivers side from months of use wouldn't come off, so he decided instead of using soap, he'd use the toothpaste.

He proceeded to scrub the front quarter panel, drivers side doors (front and back) and the rear quarter panel, with an abrasive toothpaste. After it dried he noticed the swirls, and the fact that he'd sanded the clear coat off. 

Now, it's an older car (2013),  but I've maintained it, and it's mine. I've kept it in perfect condition and I'm the first and only owner. 

So, I was left with an entire driver's side that had swirl marks and looked sanded down. I didn't get angry when I saw it, I was stunned, and I said I just want it fixed, and that I understood it was a mistake. I explained the clear coat had been sanded, and that likely the only way to fix it is to repaint it. He called friends, even called my brother in law, and they all said the same thing: It would need repainting. He called for estimates, and someone said they could buff it out. They tried, he paid, they didn't fix it. Quotes range from 1200 to 2k.

I brought it up at dinner, and his logic was:

1. It's not like I drive it every day

2. I could only sell it for maybe 7k, so it's not worth the cost of repainting

3. He's trying to save money and work within a budget he has for himself

Then my wife stepped in. In her words:

1. If it were her car, she wouldn't care (I maintain her car too)

2. Do I expect our son to pay 2500 dollars to repaint my car?

3. If I caused that damage, would I pay 2500 myself to get it fixed given the value of the car?

That last one was said in such an insanely accusatory manner, like I'm unreasonable. Now, look, here's the deal, I'm in therapy. I've got my own problems, so please realize that everything I'm conveying to them is me being very careful and mindful about how I speak to everyone. So please believe me when I say I'm making every effort here to not be negative, and be as factual as I can. I've spoken to my therapist, because this bugged me. She advised me to rescind any driving privileges until it's fixed. I spoke to my sister (the brother in law of mine that my son consulted), and she believes that he better pony up, and it's an expensive mistake, but it's on him. ",Not enough info,2024-08-29,"AITA: Son damaged my car, doesn't want to fix it, wife agrees with son First, a little backstory.

I ( 46 female) have two children (20 male and female twins). My daughter has been staying in an apartment near her college campus since she was 19. She comes home for holidays and to visit during her summer break. On her most recent visit, my husband (55 male) took her car to get her air conditioning fixed. While he had her car, he found a pack of cigarettes in her glove compartment. He hasn’t been able to give me a reason why he was looking in the glove compartment. He immediately came to me and told me about the situation. For context, I started smoking when I was about 15 years old and didn’t stop until my pregnancy when I was about 25. I am also an oncologist, so I have worked with many people who have gotten cancer as a side effect to smoking. After my husband told me what he had found, I sat my daughter down and had a conversation with her. I asked her many questions including why she had started smoking in the first place, and after a bit of badgering she admitted it was because her friends and roommates had recently started smoking weed on weekends. She didnt want to participate in drug use but also didnt want to feel left out so she had started smoking a cigarette while they smoked weed. I asked her since she was only smoking to fit in like this, if she would consider smoking herbal cigarettes or nicotine free cigarettes instead. She told me that she had considered herbal cigarettes first, but the only place that would sell to her without ID didn’t carry them. I offered to buy her nicotine free cigarettes that she payed for so she wouldn’t have to struggle with nicotine like I did. She agreed and I bought her a box later that day. The way I see it is that my daughter is an adult and can make her own choices. She lives in an apartment that she pays rent for and is free to do what she likes. As a mother, I can only hope she males the right choices and help her when she needs me. 

When my Husband found out that I didn’t scold her for smoking and offered to buy cigarettes for her he was infuriated. He told me that I was helping her learn to give in to peer pressure and pushing her towards a possible addiction. When I tried to explain my view he put it simply by saying if she is too young to buy her cigarettes on her own then she is too young to smoke them.

I respond by mentioning that I would like to save a spot in case I want to invite Layla.

Here's where it gets interesting: my close friend Sarah eventually reveals to me that she is uncomfortable being in competitive environments with people who she has never met. While I understand where she's coming from and even share her anxiety to an extent, I tell her that I would still like to invite Layla. The reasons being, Layla and I have discussed her joining us for trivia in the past, but she lives over an hour away and trivia is usually on a weeknight. The finals are on a Saturday, so I thought great, this will be an opportunity for her to join us and also to meet some of my friends. From my perspective, I reasonably and calmly explained all of this to Sarah, and told her that while I sympathize with her anxiety, I would still like the option to invite Layla.

Also might be worth mentioning, Sarah has invited a guy she was dating to numerous trivia nights. I find the guy rather annoying to be honest, but I did not reveal this or ask her not to invite him, because I knew that he made her happy and I wanted to be supportive of my friend.

According to Sarah, I am ruining something that she was looking forward to and that we worked for as a team, and I'm revealing how little I care about her feelings by still wanting to invite Layla.

While I understand where she's coming from and even share her anxiety to an extent, I tell her that I would still like to invite Layla. The reasons being, Layla and I have discussed her joining us for trivia in the past, but she lives over an hour away and trivia is usually on a weeknight. The finals are on a Saturday, so I thought great, this will be an opportunity for her to join us and also to meet some of my friends. From my perspective, I reasonably and calmly explained all of this to Sarah, and told her that while I sympathize with her anxiety, I would still like the option to invite Layla.

Also might be worth mentioning, Sarah has invited a guy she was dating to numerous trivia nights. I find the guy rather annoying to be honest, but I did not reveal this or ask her not to invite him, because I knew that he made her happy and I wanted to be supportive of my friend.

According to Sarah, I am ruining something that she was looking forward to and that we worked for as a team, and I'm revealing how little I care about her feelings by still wanting to invite Layla.

So, should Sarah be more supportive of me as a friend and accept that I want to bring my date? Or am I being an asshole and disregarding her anxiety and feelings?",0.0,1.030509114265442,1,0
122,1f3qjb4,WIBTA if i took an independent study slot that my friend also want?,"hello! i am a 15F junior is highschool and my friend is 16F, also a junior. my highschool offers something called independent study, where you can basically study anything you want and are given a class period a day to do so. the way that this works is that you go to a classroom and basically just hang out and do your work, sometimes helping out the teacher.

next year i am considering trying to get an independent study period to work on stuff related to coding and world building, this is deemed as an english topic, so i would have my independent study teacher be an english teacher. you do not have to have had the teacher to do an independent study with them.

teachers can only have 1 independent study student per period.

  
now for the problem, i dont have a good teacher to do an independent study with that ive had in the past, my freshmen year was with a teacher who only takes independent studies as teachers aids, and my teacher last year was really really bad and didnt like me. i dont have an english class this year.

 i was considering asking my friends english teacher, im in his room every day to hang out with friends, and he is the person in charge of crew for theatre, so he knows me quite well. my friend had him last year, and has him again this year. 

on paper she is the better canidate since she has actually had him, but she didnt have any intrest in an independent study until i mentioned asking her teacher. she has never mentioned it, and even said she didnt want one, but the moment i said i was considering it she said i had better not ask him and take hat spot because she thought she was a better fit because she wants to go into journolism.

she is on the normal track to graduate and needs to take all subjects next year, whereas i am all covered and can take whatever i want. if i asked im almost garenteed an independent study, with the only real hurdle being finding a teacher to take me.

would i be the asshole if i tried to take the spot?

125,1f3ptme,AITA for not making my fiancé’s brother’s girlfriend my bridesmaid? ,"My fiancé (28M) and I (24F) are getting married. We have been together for 8 months. When you know, you know. We recently started wedding planning and everything was going okay until my future mother in law (FMIL) made a comment stating we are the reason why my future brother in law (FBIL) and his girlfriend are breaking up. My fiancé and I were taken aback by this comment. 

A little context, my fiancé has a younger brother (26M). FBIL and his girlfriend (25F) have been dating for 2 years now. In those 2 years, he never introduced her to the family until my fiancé introduced me (2 months into us dating). In that entirety of us dating, my fiancé and I only hung out with them a handful of times. I don’t know her personally at all. I never sat one on one with her and actually had a conversation. I thought she was alright until I noticed some weird behavior after my engagement. On the day I got proposed to, she excused herself from the celebration. When we asked my FBIL, he said she had some emergency. My fiancé and I really didn’t think of it as anything since we were at a high from getting engaged. Afterwards, she started giving me the cold shoulder and I couldn’t understand why. My fiancé noticed it too. I never really confronted her because I was minding my own business and it didn’t really affect me until it became an issue with the wedding planning. 

Going to back to the initial comment, my FMIL wants me to make her my bridesmaid because it’s affecting FBIL’s relationship. FBIL explained to us that his girlfriend doesn’t want him to walk down the aisle with “another bitch” at the ceremony. He is my fiancé’s best man at the wedding. I was really hurt by the comment because that’s not really fair to put that on me. I cannot make her my bridesmaid let alone my MOH when I have other friends in my life that I am much closer to and have known longer. There are so many other reasons to why we haven’t considered including her in our bridal party. My fiancé and I have noticed a lot of red flags in their relationship. FBIL and his gf have broken up many times and gotten back together since our engagement. I think it’s not fair to have someone in ALL our wedding photos that FBIL is not even sure of, since they have a on and off relationship! His girlfriend accused me of having a personal vendetta against her for not making her my bridesmaid. Later in that conversation, FBIL told my fiancé and I that she is upset it was me getting engaged before her since they have been dating for longer. He also told us that on the night of our engagement, she excused herself to talk to her mother on the phone because she was very upset at him. Now it makes sense why she has been giving me the cold shoulder. 

My fiancé has been very supportive in this entire situation. He has told his family that whomever I choose to make my bridesmaid is completely my decision and they shouldn’t have a say in it. No one from my side of the family is one of my fiancé’s groomsmen too.

I don’t think I am being unreasonable, am I? 

  
**UPDATE**: 

Thank you all for sharing your thoughts! I really appreciate it because I’ve been struggling feeling like I’m at the wrong. FBIL's gf and I actually texted and she wrote, “I didn’t want to be a bridesmaid, but it did feel like that was when you definitively closed off any chance of a ‘sisterhood’ or relationship between us.” She also wrote, “…got offended at how I was being excluded. Maybe to you it didn’t feel unjust but to a lot of people it did, me included. You knew we would see each other frequently at family events until forever and could have built a closer relationship.” 

The two statements just doesn’t add up. How can she say that she didn’t want to be a bridesmaid and then proceed to say she felt excluded. She firmly believes that me not making her my bridesmaid is me making it clear that I’m not interested in ever having a relationship with her??

In this way, we are able to share with the responsibilities of covering our family expenses and have our own money for personal needs.

Recently, my BIL (41M) shared the news that his SIL that lives overseas is getting married. Her immediate family in the country has been invited to attend the wedding. Her only sister, my BIL’s wife, is expected to be there. The trip will require visa and of course, plane tickets. As we know traveling is a bit expensive. My BIL has to pay for his plane tickets and visa processing as not all the expenses can be covered by his SIL. For this, my BIL is asking (not borrowing) money from my husband to fund his travels. My husband was planning to give out but he would take it from our joint account and not his personal account. I firmly said no and told him that if he wants to help he can get money from his personal account and give what he can afford. I also said that if his BIL cannot afford the trip then he shouldn’t be joining. His wife can go with her family to attend the wedding. 

My husband is now upset as he said that I said no and even mentioned that I was a bit insensitive as my family side was never in the situation to ask extra money from us.

⭐️UPDATE! (editing this original post for update)⭐️


First off, thank you for the advice, feedback and concerns. A lot of you were asking how much is the cost of the trip. We are from Asia and the wedding will be in the US. The cost of plane ticket and travel expenses is quite high. Their plan is stay for another 2 weeks after the wedding. All-in-all estimated cost is around USD 2500.

My husband and I had a discussion on this matter. I was relieved when he admitted that it was wrong of him to think about using money from our joint account. He apologized for it and on how he reacted when I said no to the request. He assured me that he has not touch our joint account. I’ve checked our account and sure enough there was no fund transfer recorded.

My husband initially thought of our joint account as he didn’t have enough money to the BIL’s request. I honestly don’t know how much he has in his personal account. It is his money. He also doesn’t know how much I have on my own account. He feels that he needs to provide as he earns more than the rest of his siblings. I told him that if it is an emergency we can help. In this case, it is not an emergency or a priority. He shouldn’t feel bad or burden himself about setting boundaries. We end our discussion with him still open to pitch in but only around USD 200. He will get the money from his personal account. 

In the evening, we had a dinner with his side of the family. The topic of the trip came up. BIL was excited and jokingly asked solicitation from his siblings. It was a good thing my MIL (their mom), my husband and another BIL (their other brother) told him off and said that if he wants to go then he needs to fund his trip. BIL awkwardly laughs it off and was saying about getting commission/bonus at work. My other SIL (married to the other brother) secretly informed me that BIL also made demand to the other brother.

128,1f3p3jr,AITA for snapping at my sister over text?,"I 23(F) have a sister 19(F) who has a tendency to constantly say what's on her mind even when she probably shouldn't, especially towards friends and family. 

She does a very good job of setting boundaries with people but has a difficult time understanding other people's boundaries and will react one of two ways. 

The first is upset, this is particularly towards friends. She'll get almost shaken and terrified if a friend sets a boundary with her because she thinks she did something wrong. 

The second is dismissive, this is particularly towards family. Often times when a family member sets a boundary with her she seems to treat it like a chore. I want to note that our parents and extended family aren't the greatest people and have a lot of narcissistic tendencies. 

Usually she and I help take care of each other and watch each others backs and make sure to not incur the wrath of any family. However, there are often times when she tends to say the wrong thing at the wrong time even towards me. 

One particular thing she does is make notes of people's shortfalls and vocalizes them very bluntly and criticly. Be it the tone of our voice when we say something, if we make a decision she doesn't agree with, or even behaviors we view as normal. 

I would also like to note that my sister and I are both neurodivergent which could play a factor into how we reacted. 

Now onto the story. 

My sister and were hanging out at home in the living room. We had a few conversations then it died into silence to which I then went on my phone and started taking care of some password issues. Apparently while I was doing that my sister began talking again and it didn't register in my brain that she was talking because I was hyper fixating on my password issues. Once it registered that she was talking I stopped what I was doing and asked her to repeat herself to ewhich she replied. 

""I get so angry when I tell you something and you don't even listen to me."" Her tone was clearly joking but it really hurt my feelings because I genuinely thought it made her uncomfortable and my attention span is something I often got bullied and yelled at for by family and people around me. She didn't take it well and went upstairs

This is behavior I have endured for years and most of the time I bite my tongue and try to be the better person. However, this time I definitely had a enough. 

My pot was bubbling over and I snapped. 

I proceeded to tell her over text how she tends to treat boundaries like a chore and how she hardly has any paitence and understanding especially towards me. I also told her how her actions had hurt my feelings time after time again and that was done putting up with her behavior. Again she didn't take it well and messed up my room. 

Part of me feels good for getting all those repressed feelings off my chest but part of me feels like I'm being dramatic and I should've gone about it differently. 

So am I the asshole?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-29,"AITA for snapping at my sister over text? I 23(F) have a sister 19(F) who has a tendency to constantly say what's on her mind even when she probably shouldn't, especially towards friends and family. 

She does a very good job of setting boundaries with people but has a difficult time understanding other people's boundaries and will react one of two ways. 

The first is upset, this is particularly towards friends. She'll get almost shaken and terrified if a friend sets a boundary with her because she thinks she did something wrong. 

The second is dismissive, this is particularly towards family. Often times when a family member sets a boundary with her she seems to treat it like a chore. I want to note that our parents and extended family aren't the greatest people and have a lot of narcissistic tendencies. 

Usually she and I help take care of each other and watch each others backs and make sure to not incur the wrath of any family. However, there are often times when she tends to say the wrong thing at the wrong time even towards me. 

One particular thing she does is make notes of people's shortfalls and vocalizes them very bluntly and criticly. Be it the tone of our voice when we say something, if we make a decision she doesn't agree with, or even behaviors we view as normal. 

I would also like to note that my sister and I are both neurodivergent which could play a factor into how we reacted. 

Now onto the story. 

My sister and were hanging out at home in the living room. We had a few conversations then it died into silence to which I then went on my phone and started taking care of some password issues. Apparently while I was doing that my sister began talking again and it didn't register in my brain that she was talking because I was hyper fixating on my password issues. Once it registered that she was talking I stopped what I was doing and asked her to repeat herself to ewhich she replied. 

""I get so angry when I tell you something and you don't even listen to me."" Her tone was clearly joking but it really hurt my feelings because I genuinely thought it made her uncomfortable and my attention span is something I often got bullied and yelled at for by family and people around me. She didn't take it well and went upstairs

This is behavior I have endured for years and most of the time I bite my tongue and try to be the better person. However, this time I definitely had a enough. 

My pot was bubbling over and I snapped.

129,1f3ou27,AITA for staring down my brother's boyfriend and going off on him ?,"My (24M) parents for the most part accept my little brother Derek (19M) as gay  since he came out in the 8th grade,but we're from a rural area and the only boys he's ever  dated were other country boys who played sports and wrestled and hunted just like him. Some guys weren't necessarily particularly ""nice"" to Derek but my parents were pretty "" boys being boys""

My parents don't like his very fem current boyfriend Zak (18M) and make every attempt to let Zak know it , to the point that they're always bringing up Cody (20M) Derek last boyfriend in highschool. Always talking about how perfect he was and asking why they broke up  or how are younger brothers loved him in front of Zak while Derek just doesn't say anything. It came to head on Derek's birthday party over the weekend and my parents invited some of his old friends/football teammates including Cody.

The parents spent all night loving on Cody which pissed of Zak because Derek was just kinda killing around all quiet and Zak spent most of the party hiding upstairs.. For reference Cody was "" not nice"" so ""not nice"" that Derek is terrified of him and I had to be the one to help Cody understand they were broken up. 

After everyone was gone I heard yelling upstairs. I ran up and Zak was going off on Derek' about not saying anything and Derek was starting a panic attack. I  was definitely pissed because Zak was yelling like that at Derek and he'd been through enough of that.I glared down Zak and I screamed at him to never yell at Derek like that again. He got this scared look on his face and just sat down while I took Derek with me to calm him down.. After he relaxed some Derek tells me I shouldn't have acted that way with Zak because he didn't know. He wants me to apologize.

130,1f3oqwd,AITA for not going to my partners dad funeral?,"AITA for missing my bfs fathers funeral?

My bf (23) recently lost his father in a tragic accident. I (23) immediately rushed to be with him the day the incident occurred and on that same day agreed to fly back home with him for 4 days to support him. We have been dating for 6 months. I missed work Monday and Tuesday and asked for them to be sick days. The time I was with him was really emotionally taxing as expected. But I did everything he asked and more. Hung out with fathers friends and him until 2am, watched tv with grandma until she fell asleep, and went to the funeral home and sat there while his family whom I’m all meeting for the first time discuss funeral arrangements and pick the burial plot. 

I leave Tuesday because I have to go back to work Wednesday and I have travel plans for Labor Day. my bf expresses that he is extremely upset that I am unable to fly back to his town within the same week (Thursday) to attend the funeral on Friday. He has tons of family and friends going and I’ve already done so much imo. He says there is no obstacle standing in my way besides that I don’t want to go because he would pay for the expensive flights and anything else. I express that I want to support him but what he wants just doesn’t seem very practical. I know he is grieving so I’m trying to be easy on him but I just feel like what he’s asking of me is unfair.

132,1f3ole4,AITAH for messaging my ex’s friend,"So I’m(M26) I’ve been through an immense amount of things which I’ll probably post on this Reddit to try to find some closure for myself. But me and my ex recently broke up because I found texts on her phone saying she wasn’t physically attracted to me and wishing I looked more like her ex. I shouldn’t have looked but I mainly did because she kept bringing up how her and her ex didn’t used to fight. Honestly for me, I’ve never had a relationship where I felt hotter than when I did with this girl and it just honestly hurt so much to read that. 
When I confronted her about it, everything she said it was about was related to my personal style and how she wishes I put a little more effort into dressing myself. But I’ve literally asked her multiple times to go shopping with me to pick out clothes and help dress me up. But she never really made the time or prioritized it. She knows I’ve had serious self confidence issues cause I’ve literally had multiple women tell me that I would be their perfect man but I’m too ugly to date. 
There’s a lot of other stories which have led to this which I’ll either add in another post or an edit. Honestly, I don’t know how to trust if someone’s attraction or even affection towards me is genuine anymore. I’ve been through worse breakups and such but this is the first time I’ve ever genuinely felt like there’s no coming back. 

Honestly the hardest part of this for me is how she says it’s just my personal style. But why would she ever say she’s not “physically attracted to me” and how she would text her friend that she would never let me know because it would break my ego if I found out. It doesn’t make sense to me and I wish I could have closure. Even after all this she’s been pestering me to hookup again for months after until we eventually blocked each other. She’s been trying to even get back together after and offering to come to my place to hookup and even messaging my coworkers. I haven’t seen her since we broke up but she keeps bothering me and ignoring my requests for closure about those texts. Honestly I just wish I understood the intention behind those texts because they just keep replaying and flashing back in my mind. I begged for just a conversation of closure on why she said those things and basically just gave me a back and forth on us getting back together and it’s been consuming me. So AITAH for messaging her friend she was texting to get an answer about the situation? Her friend has just been a complete asshole about everything and honestly has given me nothing. I would be fine with being ugly in her eyes but it makes me think that either she meant it about personal style and it breaks my heart that she just couldn’t talk to me about it or she’s lying and I really never knew the woman I was dating.

My boss had his kids in the office, clearly bored out of their teenage minds, and he suggested they spend an hour or so out at a nearby place that had drinks and snacks. 
They asked him for some money and he said he didn’t have any cash. As they were leaving, I handed each of them $5 and said. Don’t order anything you are allergic to! 

They smile and said “Thank you!” Then a couple minutes later they came back and handed the money back to me. Saying no thank you.

Today he accused me of “trying to make him look like a bad parent.” 

I realize that I was inappropriate, but saying I was trying to make him look bad, is so not the case. He also said it was “unethical.” It wasn’t like I gave them $100 each. It was $5!!!
