0,1f4uvbe,AITA for calling my mom selfish for trying to change who I am?,"I (17M) was outed to my mom (30sF) as trans awhile ago. At first, she seemed really support, she helped me buy me a binder and she helped me pick out a more masculine first name.

Recently she told me that I didn't have to ""waste money"" on my binder, because a tight sports bra would've done the same. I told her it wouldn't, and she argued with me, resulting on her forcing me to try it. Spoiler alert, it didn't work and I got mad at her while she js tried to convince me it did. I told her you could obviously see my chest and she said ""you always can, you just feel like people can't."" I took a lot of offense to this.

A few days after this we were talking about something I don't really remember, & it ended up with her asking me why I tried to look so much like a guy, I told her it was bcs I'm trans.

She told me. ""Well, don't you need surgery to be trans?"" I figured it was just because she was 30, & raised Christian so she didn't understand the whole thing. I told her no, and that I was still a guy pre-surgery & explained to her how that wasn't how it worked. She asked me how I was a guy if I still had my chest, and no male genitals. I told her being trans is much more than just genitals. She proceeded to say I was just a ""wannabe."" I took major offense to that and told her to not call me that because this is something I actually struggle with & this is who I was. I told her that I didn't want to talk to her anymore about this, and she apologized.

A couple days ago. We were in the car, and we were talking about me wanting to look like a guy again. She told me ‚ÄúI didnt have to be trans to look like a guy."" I told her it wasn't just about me LOOKING like a guy, it's about me BEING a guy.

She asked me why I couldn't just look ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and be trans, l asked her what she meant by ""Normal"" and she told me something around ""you know, not masc name but birth name."" I was taken back. I told her that me being who I was before wasnt ""normal"" to ME.

I've still been mad at her for the past few days, and anytime she mentions me being trans, I just go silent and ignore her.
last night she asked me why I was so mad at her, or kept ignoring her. I told her because anytime we talk about me, she makes me fee dehumanized, or like im not me. She told me that she wasn't doing any of that and shes just trying to ""help"". I told her she was and trying to change me isn‚Äôt helping at all. She told me that she's the one who knows better for me. I called her selfish, and that she's only trying to change me for her benefits of not having a trans child.

1,1f59eht,AITA for leaving a family gathering after Mother & Father-in-law allowed their neighbour to make a racist comment?,"Edit:Stepdad, not FIL. It was late, I was upset

I (M 31) am mixed race (Black dad/white Mum) and am currently visiting my mum (60s) and her partner of 10 years (60s white) who we will call 'John'

My mum and John live in a small village in Wales, all white but something I'm fairly used to growing up in predominantly white areas of the UK.

Today I was de-weeding the front garden to help out while visiting, when John bumped into one of the neighbours (Karl 60s) and called me over to introduce myself/say hi. In the very first conversation, I mentioned I'm here for a week from London. Karl immediately led into a story of how when he was last in London he accidentally bumped into a man who proceeded to be extremely hostile and ignored all pleas that it was an accident, becoming more and more belligerent, before adding ""and he was coloured"" in a tone that lowkey screamed ""he was a dangerous n----r"", which both Karl & John chuckled at.

Caught off guard by the comment I immediately said I'm going to finish up on the garden, doing another 30 seconds of work, before putting the tools away and heading to my room. Shortly after John came to my room saying ""Sorry about Karl, he just says it how it is"" which led to me exploding saying ""You don't care about what he said because it doesn't matter to you but it matters to me, and you should care about that"" before leaving to go on a long hike.

Returning a couple of hours later, my mum came to my room in an attempt to resolve the situation.

It didn't go well. Mother began by telling me I'm blowing it out of proportion, that Karl is a weirdo and I should ignore his comments. I made it clear I don't care about Karl, I care that John allowed their neighbour to make a racist remark in front of me with zero pushback.

Mum told me I should have spoken up, I should have stood up for myself. I replied this is your friend, it's not my responsibility to correct them, and as a person of colour it is not my responsibility to educate every racist white person.

My Mum told me I'm overreacting, to which I told her she's white, she has no idea the experience of being a person of colour, & has no business telling me what is or isn't racist, or how I should feel. I've been forced to turn a blind eye to racism in my social life, in the workplace, in education & while working abroad, I am not going to accept racism in a place I call home, and that I'm packing my bag and going home tomorrow morning.

My mum is furious I'll be missing seeing the rest of the family, and believes I'm immature for not continuing to discuss the matter as a family and at least find a place to agree to disagree. I don't know what more there is to discuss, I don't know what compromise or level of racism I'm expected to tolerate, or how I'm supposed to be comfortable in the knowledge that my direct family are comfortable ignoring racism and minimalise my feeling towards it.

So, am I the asshole?

Edit: UPDATE
Firstly, sorry I should have written stepdad, not FIL. It was late, and I was upset.

Thank you for the responses, I was pretty set I wasn't the asshole but I needed some support from somewhere, and hugely appreciate all the perspectives and advice. You've really helped me from not gaslighting myself that I was the problem, and helped to collect my thoughts.

I spoke with John & my mum separately today with the headlines being 
-You do not get to tell me I'm over reacting, because you do not get to tell me how to process racism.
-I shouldn't have to tolerate racism around my home/family
-I should be able to expect my family to defend and support me in the face of racism.

Surprisingly, John was very amenable to the conversation, took what I said on board (with some discussion) and has promised greater awareness.
My Mum on the other hand listened to what i had to say but said she's too stressed with other stuff to talk about it at the moment. It's disappointing but I think she's got her own stuff to process.

Peace & Love ‚ù§Ô∏è 

Last thoughts:
1. I didn't care about Karl, he can die in a small hole. 
I cared that my family were so tolerable of racist comments while they have a biracial Son.

2. To the people who said I should have spoken up for myself. While I appreciate the sentiment, and will always call out sexism/homophobia/racism etc from my friends and family, it is not POC, women's, LGBTQ peoples responsibility to correct every random racist/sexist/homohobic individual person they meet.
If you see your friend make another of your friends/family uncomfortable & feel targeted for who they are, whether physically or verbally, you every responsibility to speak up.

It is not persectuted people's responsibility to constantly correct ignorant sexist/homphobic/racist people.

It hasn't really been an issue in our relationship. I was worried he'd smell bad because of it but he's actually a pretty clean guy and washes his clothes regularly and stuff. 

Recently my bfs granddad died and my bf was obviously distraught. I was very supportive but on the day of the funeral he got dressed like normal (no underwear) and when I told him I wasn't going unless he wore underwear he thought I was joking and told me that I harping on about nonsense to a grieving man. He reminded me he didn't have any underwear (we were a 2 min walk from a primark and I offered to grab some for him, also we were staying with his parents and 2 brothers so he could've borrowed a pair off them). But I told him it was disrespectful to not wear any underwear to a funeral. He said it was fine because it is his own suit and not a rented suit and no one will be looking at his crotch but it made me uncomfortable so I didn't go.

5,1f5805x,AITA for telling my friend not to enroll in university full time?,"I (20M) have been friends with Bob (21M) since childhood, and our parents are friends. We are opposites when it comes to school. I am an anxious overachiever, and Bob is much more lax about school. Often, Bob wouldn‚Äôt do homework or study for tests at all, and just floated through HS, not caring about grades. He had to repeat a couple classes but did end up graduating HS with bare minimum grades. I know if Bob actually put effort in, he would have done fine in school, but it was never something he cared about.

Fast forward to now, I am in my second year of university in an undergrad STEM program. Bob didn‚Äôt pursue secondary education, but is now thinking about getting a STEM degree. Bob has been out of academia for years at this point and wants to enroll in a full undergrad program, with 40+ hours of classes/labs a week while also working.¬†

This is where I may be the asshole. I told Bob it wasn‚Äôt a good idea to plunge head-first into a full degree program, given that it is a very fast-paced academic program, and would require him to spend a lot of time studying and doing homework, which is not something he has ever done. I know first hand that good study habits are developed over time, and a full semester is a lot of money.

Instead, I suggested he take a few summer courses. The Uni offers some of the required general undergrad courses over the summer, so he would be required to take these in his program anyway. I even let him borrow a¬† textbook I used when I was required to take the course earlier, so he could see if it was something he was interested in pursuing. I told him that it wasn't that I thought he couldn‚Äôt do the program, but that even I was struggling to keep up with the workload, and I have experience with staying up all night to finish homework/study. The summer courses would be required anyway, so if he did pursue the program it wasn‚Äôt like he was wasting time/money. It would give him a taste of what university was like, without having to drop thousands of dollars all at once.¬†

He told our friends and families that I thought he was stupid, and didn‚Äôt think he could do university. He told them he‚Äôs not going to even try now, because I‚Äôve discouraged him and made him feel like an idiot. One of our mutual friends told me it was cruel to discourage him from his dreams, and that I‚Äôm arrogant to think I can handle the pressures of university but he can‚Äôt.¬†

I want to be clear, I never said anything like that, and I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs stupid at all, but I know his work ethic. In his own admission, in the three months he had my textbook, he didn‚Äôt read a single page.

6,1f57sap,WIBTA for asking to buy a cooking pot set for myself? ,"i female 16, cook often. but recently for mother's Day my stepdad bought my mom a pot and pan set, cause ours were getting old and broken. when he gave my mom the set he strictly told me and my brother that we were not allowed to use the set because he was concerned we were going to destroy it. I have never destroyed anything of my parents (maybe when I was a kid) and I don't know why he would think that of me. he threw away most of the old pan set, leaving us 3.

as of recent ive noticed that I don't have enough pans or any of a desirable size since my mom also continues to use the old pans as well as her new ones. 

I have had multiple arguments with my stepdad stating that I can't just use those pans he left us because there wasn't enough. he shuts me down every time, it's whatever.

I have never destroyed anything of my parents (maybe when I was a kid) and I don't know why he would think that of me. he threw away most of the old pan set, leaving us 3.

as of recent ive noticed that I don't have enough pans or any of a desirable size since my mom also continues to use the old pans as well as her new ones. 

I have had multiple arguments with my stepdad stating that I can't just use those pans he left us because there wasn't enough. he shuts me down every time, it's whatever.

7,1f57hzw,AITA for telling my son he needs to learn to get along with other students? ,"Our son(13M) went to the same elementary school as many of his friends. We moved away to another section of the city because my mom was very sick and it allowed us to take care of her without driving 40 min each way. She needed to be checked on frequently and so we did it for her so she didn‚Äôt need to go to a nursing home. But we didn‚Äôt think it would affect our son so much. My son is very gifted in math and engineering and is probably the typical nerdy kid. Things were fine when he was in the equally nerdy elementary school. Parents specially go to that school district because of the full AP and IB high school and the property values in the neighborhood makes the schools there have special programs and after school programs. There was a robotics program for their middle school which I don‚Äôt believe is offered elsewhere. 

My mom passed 3 months ago and as we live nearby we are going to be renoing the home ourselves and moving in to live nearby which will take probably a year before selling. My old sister is in Europe so I don‚Äôt have other family help in this. The problem is my son has been complaining about bullying with the school year starting he wants to go back to the original school district. My wife wants us to go back (as we sold our house at the peak and are currently renting) and rent there so he can go back while we travel 40 min each way to reno after we both work full time. 

It also means adding the cost of renting while we need to travel back and forth. My wife wants us to hire professionals and just deduct that from the sale of my mom‚Äôs house.

I don‚Äôt want him to be privileged and live in a bubble but my wife who also moved from a more normal school district to a more affluent and ‚Äúgifted‚Äù school said it was more fun to be where other kids take academic seriously and didn‚Äôt make fun of her for liking it.

In August ‚Äò23 my aunt said she was going on holiday for a week in February ‚Äò24 and that I was free to stay and have friends over. I told Sarah and she agreed to stay for a weekend

I met Joe(16M) in September ‚Äò23 he became my boyfriend in October. On new years night, he was at a party with friends and they were sending me videos of him drunk. I texted him saying that next time my aunt's house is free, he should come round for a few drinks. A few months pass and I forget about the conversation

Closer to the holiday, my aunt told me they were going on holiday for just a weekend, not the week and since Sarah had already said she was staying for the wknd, we planned for it to be just us on Friday night, and then inviting 2 other girls to sleep over on Saturday night

The weekend rolls around and the 2 other girls couldn‚Äôt stay over on Saturday night so instead Sarah and I invited Evie (16F) over for a few hours in the evening.

9,1f578qh,WIBTA for auditioning for a play that I have no intention of actually being part of?,"I (18F) recently started my freshman year of college, and I became friends with some people on my floor: Julie (18F), Max (18M), Luna (17F), and Eli (18NB). Julie and Max are both theater nerds who plan to audition for our school's production of *A Midsummer Night's Dream*, while Luna, Eli, and I just love Shakespeare.

We were all in the student lounge yesterday talking about Shakespeare and the upcoming play, when Julie suggested we all audition together as a fun group activity. I said yes due to some combination of my love for Shakespeare, the enthusiasm of my friends, and the energy of the moment. Luna and Eli were a lot more hesitant than me but were willing to try it out. I had no expectation I would be cast, but it was a lot of fun messing around with the lines.

However, now that I think about it, it might be disingenuous to audition when I don't really want to be part of the play. Moreover, if by some strange twist of fate I'm casted for something, I wouldn't accept the role. I don't want my friends to be upset with me after I said I would do it and ran lines with them, but I'm feeling really conflicted right now. WIBTA for still auditioning?

I was finally working up the courage to tell my Dad about some of my trauma. She was getting in the way. This (along with a sleepless night and well life) broke me and I was going through a complete mental breakdown. 


I went to my Dads room. Locked. I went outside, he wasn‚Äôt there. He was gone. So I choose the next best person, A. I lay everything on him, everything I‚Äôm going through, everything that‚Äôs happened to me, things I‚Äôve never told anyone else. 


He was speechless.

When I was done, he was fully convinced of telling the school counselor. Except he didn‚Äôt tell me that. He told me that it was my choice to tell the counselor and my choice to get help if I needed it. Later on, I get a call from the counselor. ‚ÄúHey man, you ok‚Äù.

It started this summer when a girl, lets call her Isabelle told me that she like a boy, let's call him David. I have been friends with David for years so excited I told him that Isabelle liked him. What he told me next is what started all of this, he told me that my other good friend, let's call him Scott, liked Isabelle.

When the school year started, David told Isabelle that he didn't like her. This was about the time when I got really close with Scott and he started telling me about how he like Isabelle and how she didn't like him back.

Fast forward to about a week ago, I saw Scott's mental health decline as he told me he was upset and trying to get over Isabelle by not talking to her. At the same time, David was starting to talk to this one girl, let's call her Sarah.

David was having a hard time trying to talk to Sarah so I asked some of Sarah's friends if she liked him. They said to tell David to not ask her out. I went back to my lunch table and told Scott that she didn't like him. Isabelle then told me to walk with her and she told me that the friends of Sarah lied to push an agenda to get David to date someone else.

Then Isabelle told me that since she told me a secret I had to tell her one and I just told her that Scott liked her. She said she already knew and that I needed to tell her more. I felt like I owed it to her since I had already broken her trust once so I just told her about a lot of stuff Scott had said about her.

Yesterday I was telling her that I wanted her to tell Scott that she didn't like him because he was really getting depressed about it and I wanted him to feel better.

Today after school Isabelle told Scott that she didn't like him but she also told Scott about how I told her that he liked her. Now he is mad at me.

12,1f56sm0,AITA for not insisting my girlfriend stay home from the hike?,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for around 3 years and things have been going well for the most part, we are very different people, in fact I think the differences between us usually make us stronger and a better couple. I am an avid hunter, fisher, and hiker. My girlfriend's idea of spending a day in nature is listening to music on her dad's porch with the potted plants, and I don't see why that doesn't count, it's just different. 

When we first started dating, I cut back on my time outside, not consciously, I just wanted to spend more time with her and because at the time I lived pretty far from her, it became a choice of which I wanted to do. However, we moved in together at the beginning of this year, and this summer has been the first summer that she has seen exactly how often I like to be outside. 

She told me that she felt neglected, and said that she felt like it was a part of my life she wasn't welcome in. Not the case, so I told her that if she wanted to go, anytime, then she was welcome, but I knew it wasn't her kind of thing, so I stopped asking. Because of that, I took her to this berry patch I knew about, and we both had a great time, even if she got too hot when the sun came out, and we had to leave a little earlier than I would have liked. Anyway, we had a couple small outings like that, berry picking, pawpaw hunting, light hikes, etc. 

 I was invited back to my home State for a hike I have been on many times with friends (Devils Bathtub if you know it). I asked my girlfriend if she would mind me going, because I hadn't seen these guys in a while, and we could catch up. She ended up asking if she could come, which is when I hesitated. This hike isn't too difficult by any means, but I was unsure she would have fun, based on what I knew about her. I explained that it was a little harder than the hikes we had done, and that it would probably be best to work up to it a little more. She got offended, thinking I was saying she couldn't do it, which isn't what I meant. I tried to explain that it might not be as fun for her as the other hikes we had. She insisted it was no big deal, and that she would have a great time, so I decided to trust her judgement and agree. 

So we go. And it goes about as well as you're picturing. we made it about a quarter of the way through before she started getting upset, it was visible, but she didn't say anything. I tried to be as supportive as I could, but she was just quiet and angry and snippy the whole time. When we got to the car she started crying and accusing me of 'setting her up', because it was harder than she expected, and said I should have told her that it was that hard. I told her that I had, but she said that I didn't explain it well enough, and that I made her look like an idiot. In my opinion, I did everything I could to warn her, and she is an adult who had the facts, and internet access if she wanted to double check her theory that it would be no trouble.

She told me that she felt neglected, and said that she felt like it was a part of my life she wasn't welcome in. Not the case, so I told her that if she wanted to go, anytime, then she was welcome, but I knew it wasn't her kind of thing, so I stopped asking. Because of that, I took her to this berry patch I knew about, and we both had a great time, even if she got too hot when the sun came out, and we had to leave a little earlier than I would have liked. Anyway, we had a couple small outings like that, berry picking, pawpaw hunting, light hikes, etc. 

 I was invited back to my home State for a hike I have been on many times with friends (Devils Bathtub if you know it). I asked my girlfriend if she would mind me going, because I hadn't seen these guys in a while, and we could catch up. She ended up asking if she could come, which is when I hesitated. This hike isn't too difficult by any means, but I was unsure she would have fun, based on what I knew about her. I explained that it was a little harder than the hikes we had done, and that it would probably be best to work up to it a little more. She got offended, thinking I was saying she couldn't do it, which isn't what I meant. I tried to explain that it might not be as fun for her as the other hikes we had. She insisted it was no big deal, and that she would have a great time, so I decided to trust her judgement and agree. 

So we go. And it goes about as well as you're picturing. we made it about a quarter of the way through before she started getting upset, it was visible, but she didn't say anything. I tried to be as supportive as I could, but she was just quiet and angry and snippy the whole time. When we got to the car she started crying and accusing me of 'setting her up', because it was harder than she expected, and said I should have told her that it was that hard. I told her that I had, but she said that I didn't explain it well enough, and that I made her look like an idiot. In my opinion, I did everything I could to warn her, and she is an adult who had the facts, and internet access if she wanted to double check her theory that it would be no trouble.

She was clearly upset and said it was our anniversary and wished I hadn‚Äôt gotten her hopes up that I could spend time with her today. I carpooled with my mom to the hospital and my gf is using my car to go to the activity which is an hour away from the hospital. 

If I could have somehow scheduled my dad‚Äôs surgery on some other day I would have but that‚Äôs just not how reality is. I thought that I should prioritize my dad today because he just had surgery.

We worked together all the time in the class and sometimes (rarely tbh) hung out outside of school. She was a good friend, but not someone who I could personally consider a ‚Äòbest friend‚Äô due to our opposing natures and interests. Her attitude sometimes annoyed me as she once complained over a small thing - me not reading a book that she had gifted me despite me not being a massive reader (I had told her this). I dont believe she thought of me as her ‚Äòbest friend‚Äô either, which was fine since we mostly interacted during class.

Additionally (you dont have to read this, just wanted to share lol), once her birthday rolled around I gave her quite a good gift that matched her interest at the time. However, when my birthday was around the corner, I constantly dropped hints of what I wished for my birthday since she didnt really seem to care for my personal interests. I said stuff like ‚Äúoh maybe something x themed would be nice!‚Äù. She instead crafted a gift that was not aligned with my interests and that I also could not use in any way shape or form, I was quite disappointed.

Anyways, we have now finished our exams and are moving onto the next part of our education. I had plans to go to the same school as her but as time went on, we seemed to distance from one another.

The bigger issue is their dogs. They let their dogs out whenever they want, and let them bark incessantly.

23,1f54mh5,AITA because I apparently drove past my date without greeting her,"Disclaimer: English is not my first language. Even thou I am using English daily at work I am still thinking and dreaming in my native language (It is still the same language family tree). Additionally, I don't think that this whole situation is salvageable at all but would like some outside perspective from reddit, whether I am insane or the world around me turned insane.

I am finding myself in a Kafkaesque Situation and wouldn't be surprised if I wake up tomorrow transformed into a huge insect. At least then, the situation would make sense to me.

Bear with me, that might be a long one, as I think I should provide you the proper context around this situation. But please be aware, that I can only give you my perspective as she is rejecting to talk to me at all.

# Background

I've but the whole background for the sake of completeness into a post in my profile. Here the short version:  

* matched with her (W36 at that time) on bumble shortly after Christmas
* had first date an January and was euphoric
* had a couple of follow up dates
* because of her time constraints she wanted to get back to me, when she has more breathing room (previous relationship, moving to a new apartment, ...)
* so I gave her room as I didn't want to push her away by being to brash (hope that is the correct word).
* she wanted to reach out to me, when things are better

Surprise, surprise she didn't. We are around June now.

# Now the actual story for which I wanted to be rated:

In July I installed Bumble again I was chatting there with an other woman, who later ghosted me, but this just as a side note. I was swiping in bumble and then I saw her (now F37) again. The first thing I felt was a knife through my heart. She had forgotten me. (I think my problem is that I am always way more invested then my counterpart. This can only lead to disappointment) But then I decided why not try it again, as I still had her number I reached out to here and she agreed to meet again. We met for dinner and talked all the time. I was really enjoying the time with her. She agreed that we should really spent more time together. There my hope goes up again.

And again finding slots was difficult as she is always doing something. We finally were able to meet for a short bicycle ride on August, 29th it was nice but short. This was the last time I talked to her in person. Talking while cycling can be challenging so I proposed to have a walk next time which makes talking easier. She agreed telling me that she is looking forward to it. As I was still afraid in pushing here away by being to intrusive I waited till the weekend before reaching out to her again asking whether she want to meet the next week. Oh wonder, she didn't have any time for me. I thought myself, okay she might have stress at work or other stuff happening that I am not aware of and didn't push further. The next week I did reach out to here again on Thursday (August, 8th). I had seen her in the morning while passing the bus stop were I was standing on the opposite side of the street. I waved at here, but she didn't seem to recognize me. I just imagined that she is having stress, because normally she would have been at work already, and wasn't expecting me standing there. I didn't want to call here across the street (you know, center of attention), but felt bad that I didn't. So I wrote here a message when my bus drove past her, saying hello and telling here that I should have called her when she had passed me at the bus stop.

Later that day in the evening I asked here again if she might have some time next week. Not thinking about that I might have upset here in any way I wasn't aware of anything. First she mentioned that she had to check her car at a garage. I got curious and asked whether something is broken with her car, that is when she went of at me:

* she doesn't have time to meet each week
* here weekdays are fully planned
* and weekends are pre planned all the time

I was taken aback by this outburst. Didn't she tell me a while ago that we should meet more frequently and told me that she enjoyed being with me? I was overwhelmed with the situation. I deleted my Whatsapp chat with her and deleted her number from my phone. After I calmed down I was able to recover her number and sent her an excuse that didn't want to pressure her (as you may know I was afraid in pushing her away). I also asked here whether she wanted to continue to contact with me. Here answer was, that she has stress at work and that is why she reacted this way. I didn't get an answer to my second question. I thought, okay give her space. I've been patient for a long I can keep waiting. Didn't want to face my Conscience without at least having tried it. Otherwise I would always think, what if ...

I waited but never heard anything from her.

Two days ago I reached out to her and asked whether we could meet to talk about what happened. I was in disbelieve and wanted to understand what is happening. She replied and thanked me for my patience and said that she doesn't see a future for us. I was heart broken. A couple of weeks ago she wanted more and now nothing? She didn't even want to talk to me in person but by messenger. I was in shock and couldn't reply to her message at all. After a restless night I reached out to here the next day via messenger asking her why the change of mind. What happened? I told here that I am confused and would really like to talk to here about it.

The answer stunned me: She agreed to meet more often because she was also seeing something in me, but I had, apparently, ignored here completely while passing her on the road. And as this had happened three times it couldn't be a mistake and was doing it on purpose.

WTF

I was completely stunned. Couldn't believe my own eyes what I was reading. I tried to get some clarification from her, but she completely stonewalled me. I was desperate. I was in disbelieve. I am still not grasping it. Is something wrong with me. Am I loosing grip on reality? Is this really happening?

So dear Reddit users: AITA here?

24,1f54l6f,AITA for shouting at my dad when he was shouting at mom. ,"A bit of rant:

My dad has always been an abusive husband. He would always shout slurs & hit mom from the very day they were married. My mom being a strong woman has endured it all. My first memory of them fighting was when I was 13 years old. We were going through a period of crisis. My dad's business was failing & we were about to lose our house. From what I remember, my dad started ordering some shoes & mom started asking him to stop. That's when he lost it & threw a glass at the wall 2ft away where my mom was standing. That was the first time I shouted at him. Then all the relatives, police came & all the drama happened. Then matters settled down for a while. 

Then again, when I was 17, he started hitting my mother randomly one Sunday morning. My sister while sobbing woke me up & I broke up the fight. My mother, my sis & I went to my grandmother house for a week. Then my father again came to us & apologized & we went back. At that time, I was going through some personal shit, so everything that happened was just a blur. 

Now I am 23 years old. I have a stable job & am earning well. I have always been introverted & scared from people, which is hugely due to my family atmosphere. But recently when my dad was again shouting I got up & gathered the courage to speak/shout at him. He backed down, said sorry the next day. That was 3 months ago & everything was going smoothly till tonight. 

Tonight my dad was late as always. He came around 11:30pm & went to his room where slammed the doors loudly & turned on the lights. My mother was sleeping in the room & asked him to quiet down & turn off the lights. By now, she has been through a lot & even had a fight with cancer 4 years ago. She now suffers regularly from pains & wants her sleep. My dad then again started shouting & throwing slurs. I was so fed up with his bullsh\*t that I went to his room & asked him what exactly his problem was. He then started shouting again & I at the top of my lungs said ""SHUT UP, DON'T YOU KNOW HOW TO SPEAK"" which then started a huge argument as to how I am his son & have no right to speak to him that way. Then he said to leave the house & the whole shenanigans. He threatened to call the police & I went ahead & said that sure do so. The police came about an hour ago, said they would forward the complaint to the women cell & left within 30 mins. They gave the same thing that how we should adjust & compromise. 

So AITA in this situation. What should I have done & what could I have done differently?

This situation has been taking a toll on my mental health as I suffer from anxiety and depression, and having to deal with someone else‚Äôs literal shit isn‚Äôt helping.

I‚Äôve even gone out of my way to buy all the necessary cleaning supplies and left them by the toilet for him to use, but he still doesn‚Äôt flush properly. He only flushes once and just hopes for the best, I guess.

Today, it happened again. I was already stressed because I had a fight with a friend and came home really mad. My boyfriend was with me, and he knows how much this situation affects me. Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt move out for another three months because of the contract, but after that, I‚Äôm moving in with my boyfriend.

When I got home, I decided to shower and, of course, found that my housemate hadn‚Äôt flushed again. His friends were over, but I know it was him who made the mess because they only arrived after me and my boyfriend‚ÄîI even asked them at the reception when they came in.

I was furious. I stormed straight to his room and screamed at him. I called him a disgusting fat pig and some other names I‚Äôm not proud of. He tried denying it again, but I called him out on his BS. His friends gave him the side-eye, and he eventually went to clean up after himself.

My boyfriend supports what I did. My housemate apologized and claimed he has IBS, so he poops a lot. That‚Äôs not even the issue for me‚Äîthe problem is him not flushing properly. I told him to stop using that as an excuse and to act like an adult.

28,1f53j7e,AITA for constantly inviting my brother's ex to do things with us after she went out of her way to bring my niece to visit my family during the summer?,"Like I mentioned in the title my brother's ex Maya went out of her way to bring my niece to a different country so she could spend the summer with my family. I know it couldn't have been easy for her and I felt bad that she was stuck all alone so I started inviting her to do things with us. 

Sometimes my niece would be there, which is when everybody was okay with me inviting her, but other times it was just us (my brother, family and friends) which is when people started having issues with it. The first person to bring it up was my brother's best friend. He told me to stop getting her to tag along because ""nobody"" wanted her there. I told him he should stay home if he had an issue with it because I wanted here there. We had multiple arguments over it and eventually other people started joining in and siding with him.

A lot of them were expressing faux concern for my brother but he hadn't said anything about me inviting Maya along at this point. Now I know my brother probably has unresolved feelings for Maya because she's the first person in his life to leave him and he proposed to her so I get it... but at the same time they have a daughter together now so they need to be okay being around each other and I don't want my niece to think we dislike her mother.

Eventually my brother did tell me to stop inviting Maya but he tried to act like he was saying it out of concern for her and not because it bothered him. His reasoning was that Maya's a ""homebody"" and I was ""most likely"" making her uncomfortable and she felt like she had no choice but to accept my invites because she was a guest in our home which I think he just made up because she could've said no.

The reason I'm making this post is because towards the end of their visit my brother kept getting angry at me over the slightest thing and I know it's because of this. He also joined in when his friends were bitching about me in front of my boyfriend (his friend). Usually he wouldn't let his friends say a bad word about me which is how I know I've made him really angry.

Back story 1. I did grow up in an upper-middle class family, however I have worked hard in my life and Ian knows that. At one point I was working three jobs and going to grad school full time. I also am someone who if I can do it myself, anything from fixing a toilet, landscaping, or wiring in new electrical sockets, I will do it.

2.

Ian‚Äôs dad had just hung a new painting up in their place. This is something they have mentioned a few times in regard to updates or changes around the home, and have seemed very confident about this. 

To current situation- the conversation from my understanding was to be playful. Just teasing back and fourth.

I greatly apologized and expressed I didn‚Äôt mean it to be disrespectful I thought we were teasing and even mentioned the comment Ian said before my comment- to which they responded ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt owe you anything‚Äù.

My sister hasn‚Äôt outright come out to me, but she‚Äôs admitted that she is sometimes attracted to girls, and this was one of those instances.

Now, I don‚Äôt have a problem with this, but our dad sure does. We come from a very Catholic family, and he‚Äôs very religious. I don‚Äôt think he necessarily knew that my sister was involved with this other girl. He did know that this other girl was gay, though, and for that reason told my sister she couldn‚Äôt hang out with her. My sister was really upset by this, and it was this whole thing, but she kept sneaking around to still hang out. 

I did initially keep it a secret, but then my sister went kind of AWOL the other night. My parents were freaking out because it was pretty late and she wasn‚Äôt answering her phone. Turns out, she had a late practice that she forgot to tell them about and got home in one piece, but only after I admitted to my dad that she was still hanging out with this other girl.

The reason why she signed up is because she doesn‚Äôt want to go to an event that‚Äôs also happening that day so she has a built-in excuse (That‚Äôs pretty wild to me). She asked me beforehand and I told her I thought that was a bad idea. She doesn‚Äôt like running (nor does she runs) and she could find another excuse that isn‚Äôt running a half-marathon. She still signed up anyways. She then told me that she will follow a 12-week plan for running the half-marathon that was given to her with her inscription.

Here‚Äôs the thing, I‚Äôm a runner in an elite running club, I‚Äôve run over a dozen half-marathons and countless 5ks and 10ks in my life. This summer I ran a 10k and a half-marathon. I finished 5th overall in the 10k, and 12th in my category for the half-marathon. I‚Äôm by no means a ‚Äúgood‚Äù runner (good as in make a living running) but I do know what I‚Äôm talking about. 

She‚Äôs often talked about wanting to get ‚Äúin shape‚Äù which I‚Äôve always encouraged but never pushed for (it‚Äôs not my place). About a month ago she started to go to Barre classes and she‚Äôs enjoying them quite a bit (I‚Äôve gone with her a couple times too), so I assumed that going to Barre classes was the final motivation she needed to sign up for the half-marathon.

Anyways, I advised her to start walking and jogging now before she starts the 12-weeks program. I told her that she needs to build a cardio-base before she takes on a half-marathon program that includes jogging, repetitions, intervals, long-distance, hills, etc. She doesn‚Äôt want to because she‚Äôs not willing to stop going to Barre classes and she gets tired doing two workouts a day.

Also that she has a cardio base from playing basketball growing up (she stopped playing basketball 8 years ago). I told her that she made this commitment and that she should take it more seriously, 12-weeks for a half-marathon is a pretty standard program when you have been running and you want to hit your peak in the race, not when you‚Äôre about to start from scratch.

That was the last straw and she got really upset with me saying that I was trying to put her down, not being supportive of her, and that it‚Äôs not easy for her when her boyfriend is in great shape and she isn‚Äôt.

32,1f52a1q,AITA for ruining my stepsister's birthday?,"My stepsister turned 15 last Saturday. She wanted a family dinner to celebrate. My dad and her mom agreed and invited my dad's side of the family since none of her bio family are in her life. I (16f) was supposed to be there but the night before I slept at my grandparents and then my extended family decided to spend the day with me instead. They told my dad the morning of. They had a fight. Dad called me and told me I needed to get them all there, including me, that my stepsister would be crushed if none of us showed up for her. I told him I didn't care. He tried to make us go and make me leave my grandparents house but we'd left already and he called us a bunch that morning in panic mode.

For the background... My stepsister's bio father isn't in her life, neither are his family. Neither are her mom's family. It was just them until her mom met my dad 6 years ago. My mom died 2 years after she walked out on me and dad. I was close to her family and to my dad's family and most of all my dad. I had/have some issues with the whole mom leaves and then dies so no chance to find out why stuff. But I never really missed her. I just needed my dad and he did give me his time. Until he met his wife. His time went all to her and her daughter and when we all moved in together it went on her daughter. Sometimes I was included but it was mostly 1:1 them. 

When I asked dad for time he'd tell me he needed to make up for her not having a dad, and how I could let his wife make up mom to me. I told him I needed him. I didn't need the woman who abandoned me or the woman he was now dating. I needed him. He told me not to be so greedy with him and I'd had him alone for years. I told him it didn't mean I stopped needing him and he said I had to grow up. I asked for years but always got brushed off. My dad's family would step in and my dad was like ""you need to treat both girls the same"" and he told them they couldn't be family for me and not her. He'd get mad if they got me more. But always got his stepdaughter more. One Christmas she got a Switch, 10 games and a TV for her room. I got two games I didn't like, even though I was told to make a list, and clothes. For my 16th birthday dad refused to join me and his family to celebrate at their house. He said my stepsister had a play she was in. Because I chose my birthday over her play, he didn't get me a gift either. 

My grandparents found this out Friday night when I was at their house. This is what led to them deciding they were going to prioritize me. After all the crazy of dad finding out calmed down and my stepsister was a mess because we didn't show to her birthday dinner, dad told me to stay with my grandparents. I'm still here. But he showed up yesterday after school and he told me my behavior was disgusting and as her big sister I should have been there for her and saved her from feeling hurt.

Because I chose my birthday over her play, he didn't get me a gift either. 

My grandparents found this out Friday night when I was at their house. This is what led to them deciding they were going to prioritize me. After all the crazy of dad finding out calmed down and my stepsister was a mess because we didn't show to her birthday dinner, dad told me to stay with my grandparents. I'm still here. But he showed up yesterday after school and he told me my behavior was disgusting and as her big sister I should have been there for her and saved her from feeling hurt. He said I was selfish to my core.

33,1f529kp,AITA for snapping at my bf‚Äôs ex?,"I (28F) have been dating Josh (29M) for 4 years. Back when we met he was dating another girl, S. He broke up with S after telling her he liked me. We have been together since then. S and Josh remained friends after the break up, and whenever I saw S she would always find a way to make me feel out of place. I never understood why she would reject me in such a way, since I never was a homewrecker. When S and Josh were together, I always made sure to never make S feel threatened, so I don‚Äôt really know her reasons. Our relationship has always been pretty solid: we go out on dates regularly and he often spoils me. We started thinking about getting married a while ago.

After a couple of months, my boyfriend proposed. It was really romantic, and I obviously said yes. We were both so happy. Two weeks later, we had our engagement party: everyone was invited, included S. The whole time, S didn‚Äôt really interact with anyone and just stayed in a corner. I was a bit worried about her being so quiet. I then decided to go and talk to her, just to try cheering her up. I came up to her and complimented her dress, but since she didn‚Äôt respond, I straight up asked her if something was wrong. She just looked at me and walked away. 

After about ten minutes, the speeches started: after a couple of our friends went up on stage, S went up. When I saw her taking the microphone I already felt a bit suspicious, but I just brushed it off as me being too tense. Her speech was just incredibly disrespectful and soooo off-putting: she practically embarrassed and insulted me in front of 30 people. She brought up some of my old behavior from many years ago which almost brought to me and Josh‚Äôs break up a couple of years ago. She then proceeded to say that ‚Äúno matter how badly I treat him on a everyday basis, he will never find the courage to come back home since he‚Äôs just a lovesick puppy to me‚Äù.

I was so humiliated the whole time, and I just lost it. I marched towards her and started yelling and crying at the same time. I told her to stay away from me and my fianc√©e, that I never deserved her treatment in all these years, and that she‚Äôs a pathetic loser that is still stuck on the same person after all this time. She started yelling back at me, telling me how bad of a girlfriend I am, and how she hopes Josh will see my true colours one day. Everyone around gasped, and before I could say anything else my fianc√©e ran to me, grabbed my arm and dragged me away. The party ended soon after.

My fianc√©e is now mad at me, telling me that it was just a joke. I personally don‚Äôt think it was, and in that moment I just couldn‚Äôt hold back. Most of my friends and family are on S‚Äôs side, though. Should I apologise?

Basically a family member has put me up (rented) in her 2nd home for many years since I was a teenager (I had a bout of depression and needed somewhere to stay), she's helped support me in a lot of ways, and likewise I've been there for her during her rough patches, I do a lot of stuff to help her out as well with DIY, gardening etc, and buying her nice gifts when I can afford it (TVs, a MacBook, iPhones etc)

The issue is, she's very emotionally unstable and will tend to use me to blow off steam by yelling and going on rants over the smallest irritations.

I'm autistic so I don't deal well with people like that and I try to remove myself from the situation and limit interaction as much as possible but this only enrages her more and she ends up confronting me at the house (the one I'm renting) by yelling through the letterbox or letting herself in so she can continue arguing.

She does this with her brother (my dad) and with her partner before he got wise and left. My dad visits very rarely now because of this. And it goes without saying she has zero self awareness and doesn't really seem to care how her outbursts affect her family.

I'm really at the end of my tether with it and am seriously thinking about moving out, the problem is I know she's short on cash and I think the house would need a lot of work before it's ready to be rented to non-family/sold, and she has noone else but me to call on.

A few days after this, Carrie called him while the two of us were together. He explained to me why she had initially reached out, and that if she was calling him it must be pretty serious. He did ask me if it was ok that he took the phone call, and because he seemed genuinely concerned for her I said of course. 

Carrie now calls him a few times a week and they text constantly. I have expressed my discomfort around his continuous contact with his ex and he says that he is worried for her mental health and that all he is doing is offering her a place to vent. Even though it has made me more and more uncomfortable, I feel like it would be wrong of me to demand that he stops talking to her. I don't really have any major ex boyfriends, so I don't have a lot of context for keeping in contact with an ex or anything. 

Where I might be the asshole...the other day she called him and he went into the other room to take the call. He came back out a few minutes later very dejected, saying he just had no idea how to help her in her current situation. He said he is pretty sure she doesn't have *any* friends right now, which is why she keeps contacting him. He specifically said ""I think she really needs a girl friend to talk to"". 

I found her Instagram and sent her a message, saying that if she needed another person to just blindly vent to, I would be happy to lend an ear. Almost immediately I got a message back from her and she was FURIOUS, saying that I had no business reaching out to her and demanding to know her personal life. She said she was pissed at James for spilling her life drama to me and that I needed to mind my own business. I told her that James had not told me any specifics, just that there was a lot going on. 

She blocked me and called James, who then got super pissed at me for intervening in her personal life. We got into a fight, I told him again that I have expressed how uncomfortable I am at him being her sole emotional support and that he has continue to talk to her anyway instead of like offering other mental health solutions. He said I have no business telling him he can't talk to someone and that I way overstepped in reaching out to her. That fight was last night and James said he needs to cool down before we discuss it again.

When my friend visits they tend to wash the dishes or pick up stuff from the floor. They would actually come in the door and immediately start washing my dishes.

Emily was 3 years older than me and she died when I was a few months old. My parents never recovered. My whole childhood I was in the shadows of the child they lost. I get that grief does things to people and that losing a child is the worst loss a parent can suffer, but it was like I didn't exist most of the time. They talked about Emily all the time. Sometimes they could acknowledge she was gone but more often than not she was talked about like she was still around. The most attention I got from my parents is when they force fed words about how much I loved Emily. It never came natural for me to say ""I love Emily and I miss her so much"". I didn't know Emily. But I did feel haunted by her. I had a big photo of Emily on the wall opposite my bed growing up. They wanted me to fall asleep to my sister looking over me. It always felt creepy. But they had photos of her in every room, even the bathroom. I remember trying to take the photo in my room down and my parents had a hugely explosive reaction. Like I'm talking they yelled so loud the neighbors came to check on us.

Emily's room was never touched after she died and sometimes my parents would sit in there for hours sometimes. I was also forced to sit with them in there sometimes. But I had to be very careful because I couldn't touch anything or make the room filthy.

Extended family were always so caught between being nicer to me to try and make up for my parents or coddling my parents and putting the weight of their grief and Emily's death on my shoulders. They would tell me not to be so harsh on my parents when they (my parents) would let me down. My parents could never celebrate anything I did. My extended family tried to fill that gap... but sometimes it felt like they came just to lecture me about compassion and understanding.

I did good through school despite getting no help or support from my parents and I got a full scholarship to college. Before I left my extended family came over to say goodbye and ""celebrate"" a little, because there could be no celebrating me at my parents house. My parents had these photos of Emily for me to take. They told me I'd need them for my dorm. But I left them behind. I didn't want to take photos of Emily. I wanted to get away from them and that might seem really unfair. My parents realized the next day and I got a text from my dad calling me all sorts of names for leaving them behind. Then my extended family said I could have taken one and should, because Emily is still my sister and I should still try to ""remember"" her for my parents sake if not mine.

I did good through school despite getting no help or support from my parents and I got a full scholarship to college. Before I left my extended family came over to say goodbye and ""celebrate"" a little, because there could be no celebrating me at my parents house. My parents had these photos of Emily for me to take. They told me I'd need them for my dorm. But I left them behind. I didn't want to take photos of Emily. I wanted to get away from them and that might seem really unfair. My parents realized the next day and I got a text from my dad calling me all sorts of names for leaving them behind. Then my extended family said I could have taken one and should, because Emily is still my sister and I should still try to ""remember"" her for my parents sake if not mine.

54,1f4uedq,AITA for expecting that my family cover the costs of the damages to my car?,"  I bought my first car back in May of 2024, it is a 2014 Jeep Cherokee sport and it only had 26,000 miles on it when I bought it. The only repairs I have had to make were installing new tires and headlights.

   My family is currently split as my dad took a job opportunity in Tennessee, leaving me, my mom, and my brothers in Colorado while I finish my nursing degree. My dad left with their only car, and I have been lending my car to my mom to drive my brothers and I to work, school, etc. I personally don‚Äôt mind lending my car to my mom to get us around. However, the more my car is being damaged and disrespected, I am starting to rethink it.

   It began with little things, my brothers would kick their feet up on the middle console, on the headrests of front seats, the windows and even the ceiling. They constantly slam the doors, pull on the handles when the doors are locked, spill food and drinks, and shove trash under the seats and in every crevasse. Not to mention my jeep now has around 50k miles on it, and I have only driven it a total of two times on my own. 

   A few weeks after I brought my car home, we were running errands when I heard a loud snap and my younger brother got quiet. He proceeded to reach his hand into the front seat and dropped a piece of the rear seat vent cover into the cupholder. I come to find out that this piece is no longer produced by MOPAR because of the age of the car, and the only replacement I could find was roughly $384 not including the installation. Because of the damage, you can no longer open or close the rear vents, or change the direction of them. I was fuming, but my mom told me I could just superglue it back on and it‚Äôd be fixed and that she will not pay for the repairs because it‚Äôs ‚Äúdumb to waste that much money on an older car‚Äù.
   
   Then today when my mom came home, there was a huge chip in my windshield along with several smaller chips scattered around the windshield. I lost it when I saw them. I know that she can‚Äôt control if a rock gets kicked up by another car, but she immediately blamed it on the roads in Colorado and told me that I was overreacting, that it isn‚Äôt that big of a deal and then compared it to the crack on the windshield of their car. She then told me that our car insurance doesn‚Äôt cover glass, and that I will have to pay out of pocket for the repairs which is roughly $160-250 per chip, depending on their size.

   I explained to my parents that they would need to cover the costs of the repairs to my car, and if they didn‚Äôt, I wouldn‚Äôt allow them to drive my car anymore. They responded by threatening to take me off of their insurance, and kick me out if I wouldn‚Äôt let my mom use my car. Everyone is still pretty heated and we haven‚Äôt spoke to each other since the argument. 

   I hate to see my car be disrespected by my family and I am upset that it has been damaged so much in such a short timeframe. So AITA for expecting that my family cover the cost of the damages to my car?

I inquired as to whether he was included, or if we should make other plans. The ultimate answer (after some handwringing to get one out of them) was they decided on a child free wedding, with the exception of one of my sisters fianc√©‚Äôs nephews who was to be the ring bearer - we took slight issue with that but ultimately we understand that‚Äôs someone‚Äôs personal choice. It just involves a little more coordination for my wife and I being able to attend.

He went back to work within a week of her being born and I have been a SAHM. His routine recently has been wake up at 5am three or four days a week to go to the gym. His logic to do it in the morning is so when he gets off of work he can come home and take over caring for the baby. He doesn‚Äôt fully take over care really, just changes the occasional diaper and will do a bottle feed of pumped milk while I eat dinner or take a shower. I should probably be happy he does that much, but I feel that if we make the baby she‚Äôs at least half his responsibility and not just mine. We also have two large breed dogs. One has no issue playing fetch in the yard until he‚Äôs tired, the other one prefers my husband and won‚Äôt really interact with anyone but him for extended periods of time. She‚Äôs a good dog, but is just a one person kind of dog. 

For more context, my husband worked 7 days a week, partially by choice. The money is good and he has a few financial goals, it‚Äôs not that we‚Äôd be destitute with him working a standard five days. His days vary from 8am-3pm or 7am-7pm, it‚Äôs very annoying and very unpredictable. Starting next week he starts a job that will have him work 8-12 hours a day for two weeks and then a break. Some of these two weeks he will be out of town for.

On to the current issue. This morning he wakes up, drinks his prework out, and heads to the gym. Well his key card (and for two people that showed up while he was there) didn‚Äôt work. So he comes home and is automatically grumpy. I suggest he takes the dogs for a run. Since we had our baby, I‚Äôve been trying to keep the dogs stimulate. Our baby is too little to put on bug spray for me to take everyone out in the evenings plus it‚Äôs regularly over 100¬∞. I‚Äôm also not sure I can handle a baby and two large dogs safely solo. 

He responded that he wanted to just go to work early. I tried to compromise and asked if he could just play with them in the backyard for a bit, anything to get our dogs active. He said no, saying he was worried about rolling an ankle because the yard has a few dips in it. I got mad at this, saying he needs to prioritize his dogs health the same way he does his. The one dog will not engage with me long enough to burn off energy. So his response was to say he was going to start waking up at 4am to go to the gym AND take the dogs on a run. I know this won‚Äôt happen because he‚Äôs ran with the dogs twice since we brought the baby home.

 He‚Äôs already going to be gone so much with work, I don‚Äôt understand why he can‚Äôt burn off some dog energy when he‚Äôs here. When he‚Äôs away he can go to the gym as much as he wants and do whatever in his free time. I‚Äôll be at home with a baby and two dogs. So Reddit, AITA for asking him to take the dogs on a run?

57,1f4t6n3,AITA for telling my friend that his behaviour pissed me off?,"I recently had a fight with my friend Jake (fake name). Me, Jake and some other friend have been invited to my best friend‚Äôs birthday party a couple of months ago. We all pitched in to buy her a present and I paid for everything in advance, and everyone else paid me later on. On the day of the party Jake was sick and he couldn‚Äôt attend. That evening, while I was checking on him, he asked me if he could pay only half of what he owed me since he couldn‚Äôt come to the party.

I ran the problem past the others and, although some of them thought he should have paid his share anyway, I didn‚Äôt want to cause drama or ask the others to add a little more money to cover for Jake, so I let it be and paid for his half.

A couple of weeks later Jake still hasn‚Äôt paid me the other half he owes me. I was ready to let it go, even if it was frustrating, but some of my friends told me it wasn‚Äôt fair, so I reached out to him and ask him if we could meet. We set a date, but on that day he doesn‚Äôt show up and he doesn‚Äôt even call or text me to give any explanation.

I was pretty mad, so I decided to drop it. Almost 2 weeks after, Jake messaged me, telling me he remembered he still owed me money and ask if we can meet. I told him that I didn‚Äôt even care about the money, but I was pissed he just didn‚Äôt warn me that he wasn‚Äôt going to show last time we agreed to meet. I tell him it‚Äôs okay to meet.

He completely disregarded the part where I told him that I was mad. I thought he wanted to apologize in person, but on that day he brought a friend along. I decided not to cause a scene in front of a stranger. He gave me the money and told me that now that the matter is settled, we‚Äôll arrange for another day to hang out.

A couple of days later I messaged him (because I couldn‚Äôt believe that he would be that blunt) and tell him the same things I told him the last conversation we had (how I wasn‚Äôt happy with the way he acted). His response was along the lines of: ‚ÄúTo be honest I don‚Äôt really care, I don‚Äôt even know why we are still taking about it since the matter is settled, I‚Äôm sorry that you felt this way, but I don‚Äôt really see were the problem is‚Äù

I tell him that the matter was not settled because he never even acknowledged the problem, let alone apologize. The fact that I had to message him again to ask for an apology only made me more pissed. It wasn‚Äôt about the money. If we had gone out and I had paid for him, I probably would have never asked for that money back, but this was for a gift for someone who was supposedly his friend as well. And after running after him for weeks he blew me out without a warning or so much as saying sorry?

58,1f4t3yv,AITA for speaking to my mother this way?,"For context I had been away from home for three weeks.

So this happened across multiple days. On the first day we were taking a walk and my mom who had been in the middle of lecturing me about discipline asked me the question ""do you care if I'm proud of you?"" And I don't. Not really, I don't care if she's proud of me if I'm not proud of myself, and I don't really care if other people are proud of me as long as I'm proud of my self. Am I making sense? So I tell her ""no"" because I don't care but I also don't elaborate. She doesn't ask me to elaborate either.

The next day I get another lecture, I'm not really sure what I did wrong but I do know what happened afterwards. She asked me what she always does from time to time, ""what's the password to your phone?"" And I knew she was going to check it. It's not like I have anything to *hide* from her but my phone is very personal and I didn't want anyone at all, let alone my mother, going through it. She said if I didn't give her the password she wouldn't take me or my brother to the waterpark. My brother is ten and still agrees that I have a right to privacy from my mother. I still didn't want my punishment to be his but I didn't relent for a while. My mother cornered me in oir kitchen and said a list of things to ""convince me"" to give up the password:

""I'm your mother, I'm supposed to look through your phone,""

""You're a child, you don't have the same rights as adults. Do you want to be an adult? Do you want to be an adult?""

""I don't want to look through your phone but now I *have* to because you're not letting me,""

""This was part of the deal when we got you the phone! Are you breaking your promise?""

And she tried to grab my thumb to open my phone(little does she know that I open it with my middle finger. Not because of what the middle finger means but as an inside joke about my right hand middle finger specifically)

And she kept asking me what I was hiding on my phone. So I told her this:

""Fine! Take my phone if you want, I don't want it if it gives you an excuse to snoop around in my business!""

I managed to grab it later and delete everything personal (my phone has the settings where you can't delete anything but I know the workaround)
 I gave her the password and we went to the waterpark but I wonder, was I the asshole?

EDIT: I forgot to mention why me being away for three weeks was important. I was with my dad and my mom thought that that had a bad influence on me. She threatened to file a police report because ""something obviously happened while you were away"" it wasn't an empty threat, she has done it before.

60,1f4sj90,AITA I accidentally told a friend the wrong date of my wedding and she missed it,"I (22f) have a friend (24f). She's more like a friend of a friend to me. I befriended her because of my 2 best friend. When hanging out with my friend, she was also there, so naturally we also befriended. Be we aren't really close, we never chat and don't hang out alone without the other friend. 

I got married last year, and in my culture there are one small wedding at the bride's side and a big wedding at the groom's side. My husband is from another country, so I only invited her to my side of the wedding, since we aren't so close for her to fly to another county for me. 

The date of my wedding was knows since months. We talked about in the our group chat and in person. Also, when my other 2 best friend were getting married, we made a separate group chat without the bride to talk about the wedding and to prepare gifts etc. So I assumed it would be the same with my wedding too. I thought they also talk about my wedding in my absence and plan something together. 

I'm don't remember exactly when, but some days before my wedding, this friend contacts me and asks for the wedding date. I was so stressed because of the wedding and I'm known for being clumsy, so I unintentionally gave her the wrong date. I gave her the date a day after the wedding. 

My wedding comes and she doesn't show up. To be honest, I wasn't really upset. I only invited her because of courtesy. 

Then after the wedding, my best friend A and B text me and say that this friend is furious. Apparently she was getting ready for my wedding, texted them both and found out. 

I was really sorry, she probably thinks I did it intentionally. I thought about texting her and explaining, but I was drained. The big wedding was coming and I had no nerves for this. 

And to he honest, I thought if she really cared for this wedding, she would have contacted my other friends days before the wedding, asked them about their plans and made a plan to arrive together like my other 2 best friends. So I was kinds annoyed. 

That was about a year ago and we haven't talked since. She is in the group chat, but I don't text there. I have a separate group with just my other 2 best friend. 

But now I feel bad. Should I contact her? AITB? 

Edit; I should mention, I told her the correct date weeks before. It wasn't like I only told it days before my wedding. She must have forgotten it. 

Edit; I do like my friend, but I don't think she does like me that much. It was always me trying to text her, but always answered very dryly. Whenever me and my friends planned something, she was always invited, but she rarely showed up. I mostly only saw her in college. And even though it didn't seem like she really cared for me, I invited her. 

Edit; many think that I'm the asshole, but that's ok. I don't feel bad or sorry. Shit happens in live. My wedding was small and she didn't miss anything. I don't think I'm the A.

Background information: My friend  (20f) has Autism and ADHD. I (20f) have learning disabilities, OCD and waiting to be tested for autism


My friend asked if she could stay at mine for a few days. She would ask that we do things she wanted to do which I didn't mind doing however she refused to walk to where she wanted to go, so we could end up always taking the bus though it didn‚Äôt always turn up. One of the days, she asked if we could go to London but later told me she wanted me to fund the whole trip as I work 2 jobs and she only gets $100 every week and she has bills to pay (ETA: her mum holds her money that she gets from the government and gives her 100 a week to spend) which i declined as I had my own bills to pay and I was already feeling upset at this point by her demands but we went out for a family meal to celebrate my nan‚Äôs birthday and invited my friend as we didn‚Äôt want her to be home alone. Naomi  asked if she could order a share plate for herself (which was around $40-$50) and my mum saw me get upset by the request so kindly told her, we had ordered 3 share plates already between the family to share as well as individual plates. When our food came, Naomi kept giving me a pouty face as she realized she would have to pick her own food. At the end of the meal, I thanked my parents for paying for our meals and I had to remind her to say thank you too. When we were leaving, she told me she wanted to wait to get the train back (we already paid for our return tickets that day) even after my family offered to take us back. she however did not want to walk to the station, so we ended up waiting nearly 2-3 hours for a bus to turn up. During our wait, I told her if we would have already been there if we had started walking. We would have already been at the station as it‚Äôs about a 15-20 minute walk and it was getting pretty dark and late by this point. By the time we got home it was 10.30pm and we had finished the meal by 6pm. By this point, I was really upset as she was not listening to me so I kicked her out of my house.

Some people have called me a asshole as I haven‚Äôt been that supportive of her or tried to help her understand social standards and kicked her out at night.

One of the days, she asked if we could go to London but later told me she wanted me to fund the whole trip as I work 2 jobs and she only gets $100 every week and she has bills to pay (ETA: her mum holds her money that she gets from the government and gives her 100 a week to spend) which i declined as I had my own bills to pay and I was already feeling upset at this point by her demands but we went out for a family meal to celebrate my nan‚Äôs birthday and invited my friend as we didn‚Äôt want her to be home alone. Naomi  asked if she could order a share plate for herself (which was around $40-$50) and my mum saw me get upset by the request so kindly told her, we had ordered 3 share plates already between the family to share as well as individual plates. When our food came, Naomi kept giving me a pouty face as she realized she would have to pick her own food. At the end of the meal, I thanked my parents for paying for our meals and I had to remind her to say thank you too. When we were leaving, she told me she wanted to wait to get the train back (we already paid for our return tickets that day) even after my family offered to take us back. she however did not want to walk to the station, so we ended up waiting nearly 2-3 hours for a bus to turn up. During our wait, I told her if we would have already been there if we had started walking. We would have already been at the station as it‚Äôs about a 15-20 minute walk and it was getting pretty dark and late by this point. By the time we got home it was 10.30pm and we had finished the meal by 6pm. By this point, I was really upset as she was not listening to me so I kicked her out of my house.

Some people have called me a asshole as I haven‚Äôt been that supportive of her or tried to help her understand social standards and kicked her out at night.

63,1f4ro7v,AITA for telling my sister to shut up and stop giving me parenting advice when she's clueless about autism and kids?,"My sister (35f) is single and childless currently. Though she plans to have a child via donor at 40. I (31f) am a mom of three and my middle child (Ava) is on the spectrum. Ava has sensory difficulties surrounding clothes and food. She was always considered a ""fussy"" baby. Early signs were there from when she was still a newborn and hated most of her clothes. She was also a child who did not take to eating solids. And she would struggle when being around too many people or meeting new people. We were told she was showing early signs of autism and she was eventually diagnosed. She's in a few different therapies at present and some of that is to help her with her sensory struggles.

My sister is so judgemental about Ava and how my husband and I parent her. She accuses us of coddling Ava, of making her spoiled. She gets pissed when we won't make Ava wear something she bought for Ava (that we already asked her not to) or when Ava gets different food from the rest of us, including her brothers. She has told us we need to sit Ava down and tell her she needs to eat better and she won't be getting different food from everyone. I told her that would be cruel and she said she'd learn to eat that way. I reminded her of the times Ava has been on many supplements and needed medical attention because of how little she eats and that I refuse to make her go backward. I also told her she knows what fabrics and types of clothes Ava can't handle wearing.

I mostly avoid my sister but sometimes it's unavoidable. At my nieces birthday party on Saturday my sister was telling my husband that we shouldn't let Ava eat anything at the party because it was all junk and she eats trash already. She told him we should bring her veggies to snack on and make her eat those instead. He told her no. She told me we're making her a picky eater and how she would never and she would only expose Aava to healthy foods and choices until she eats it.

64,1f4rd5a,AITA for not telling my brother's to spend time with our mother's affair baby? ,"Long story short: My mother cheated on my father four years ago and got pregnant, my father forgave her and raises my half-silbing as if she were their child.

She looks just like my mother so only a few members of the family knows what happened; I didn't know about what had happened either bc i live with my boyfriend, it was my brothers who told me everything. 

I'm not close to my parents anymore, I'm not interested in being close with their daughter because I'm not going to get into my parents' drama and toxic relationship, it's their lives, period. 

But when all that happened I was already 25 years old, while my siblings were still living with them when all the infidelity was discovered it was in the house so they saw everything. 

Coming to the present: my siblings never had a good relationship with my mother again (no, some families can't afford family therapy so it was never an option), two of them no longer live with our parents and the only one left (he is 16 years old) has come to live with me and my boyfriend. 

None of them have any contact with my parents' daughter or my parents, the 16-year-old ignored the three of them when he was at home (now I've been paying him for the psychologist). 

My father and mother have let my brother live with me but they keep insisting that I should talk with my brother's and make them spend time with her, I can't force them to do something they don't want to do. 

But my father insists that I am the older sister and I should do something for the good of the family since my brothers listen to me, my mother went so far as to tell me that the little girl asks for us even though we have never seen her. Even my grandparents are insisting that I should talk to my siblings and convince them to spend time with her but I don't know what to do and all my family who knows about this (my mother's sister and grandparents, the rest of them doesn't know anything, I think, or maybe they know but they don't care.) says I'm an ah for not doing my duty as a older daughter. 


Edit: I feel like I have to repeat this but ~no one is hating a little girl~ neither my siblings nor I hate her, we want her to be happy but we prefer to worry about our own mental health. She's four years old, a four-year-old girl doesn't do anything without her parents so letting her into my life is letting my parents back into my life.

When my brother is of legal age I plan to cut off all contact with them again, which is now only online. Meanwhile, all my siblings have their own reasons for not having contact since they lived through our parents' toxic relationship. 

My parents are just drama and I'm sick of it. I don't understand the comments saying that I abandoned her¬ø? She doesn't even know me, she's not my daughter, Why do so many talk as if I have the responsibility to raise her just because I am her half-sister?

I grew up in a household with little respect for privacy, often rationalizing it as cultural or based on how my parents were raised. However, it became frustrating, especially when it came to my room. Despite being a clean and organized person, influenced by my mom's OCD-like tendencies, I've had ongoing disagreements with my parents about the boundaries of my space. My mom's strict cleaning and organization patterns have led to constant conflicts over how I choose to maintain and decorate my room. 

Flash forward years later, I have gotten older and am now a young adult (22) preparing and saving to move out and start the next chapter of my life. However, the relationship with my parents has only worsened. The boundary of my room being ‚Äúoff limits‚Äù to my mother has been an ongoing argument ever since the day I decided to go against her style of decorating and organization. Whether it was to hang up LED strips, tapestries, or posters along my walls; it was an issue. Whether it was to buy new chairs or bean bags for my room, it was an issue. Even recently about a year ago I bought two new rugs for my floor, and that was also an issue for some ridiculous and outlandish reason. It‚Äôs done nothing but cause some of the most heated verbal conflicts between me and my parents, driving a wedge in the relationship. 

8 months after I had bought the rugs and displayed them, I returned from a 5,000 mile road trip across the country just to find my rugs removed and my room almost completely rearranged. Everything was changed and reorganized, from where I kept my very important migraine medication (I have severe chronic migraines and always keep extra strength Excedrin accessible), to where I keep my collection of shoes. I come home and find the boxes that I keep them in thrown away in the recycling, my medication is nowhere to be spotted and my entire room doesn‚Äôt look anything like it did when I left. To make matters even worse, I had recorded what my room looked like right before I had left for my trip, so I had literal video graphic proof of the issue so it only made me angrier and angrier.

Earlier this year Caleb became friends with a classmate named Luke. They wanted a sleepover playdate and everything was good until we said that Mike would pick up both boys, bring them to my place, go to the pier and then back home to go to bed. Luke's mom flat out said she wasn't comfortable with a male sitter. I laughed because I thought she was joking. She wasn't.

She said it was too weird for a male to babysit and wasn't cool with it. I said she didn't need to explain herself and there would be no playdates with our kids outside of school. She wasn't expecting that. I told her if she's not okay with a male caregiver then she probably wouldn't be okay with Luke spending the night at my place since I'm a single dad. I pointed out that she was the first parent to have a problem with this and Mike occasionally works for other families at the school. She was offended that I was offended.

I ran into Luke's mom who said she needed a sitter for a couple of weeks as her old sitter quit and the new sitter wasn't free until mid-September. She then asked if Mike would be free. She even said she would need an overnight.

I said you can't be serious. You said you didn't trust Mike and now you want him to watch your son so you can have a social life? I admit that it took guts to ask.

I told her no, we will not share our nanny. You said that it was sus when a guy has a childcare job. She said she was joking and that Mike is a nice guy. I said I know he is but you can't use him.

For the record, the days and times that she needed him are days where he is working for us. She would had paid him on top of what we pay but Mike would be at Luke's house or his place. My ex and I don't mind Mike double dipping on sitter fees by watching more than one kid because he can make a lot of money and Caleb gets a playdate. This was an exception where I did her a problem.

73,1f4oie3,AITA for accepting my coworkers job?,"Hello.  
  
My name is Carl and I work in company that offers IT support to other companies.  
There are people who go visit small businesses from main office and there are ones who got lucky and get to stay at one client, on paper everyone can do any job, but in reality people have their typical clients.  
And there is the most hated job - phone support.

I was the IT guy who had to drive around city and deal with tasks from small businesses.  
We have a ""flash meeting"" every morning to divide the new taks - this is for people who visit the smaller clients around the city. A coworker who I will call Jenny had to stay home with sick kid, and our manager asked who can cover her, as she was one of the lucky who had her own cabinet and this clients contract demands a local ""IT guy"". I agreed to do it, as it is close to my home.

Oh boy did I love it there - having a private office cabinet and I could walk to work.  
I found out that the people in that office are not that happy with Jenny, as she often has door locked so the clients have to call IT support number and can't talk directly, she also refuses to do anything that is not her job on paper.  
For example when there is problem with a TV, paper shredder, security system, phones or anything other that is not ""IT"" she said ""not my job"", but I did not - I have the door open and help with pretty much anything work related as there workload is not that big, I have plenty of free time.

The ""paperwork"" (all digital) was also messy, with the 2 weeks I was there I fixed most of the paperwork.  
On database I had multiple computers in the storage, while in reality most were given to customers, meaning they had devices without ""paperwork"", meaning that if clients breakes a laptop, they are not accountable.

That company asked my manager to replace us, so I will take this client and she would go to main office and deal with small clients in city.  
I agreed!  
I even got a salary raise because director of the client company decided to pay more for that contract in condition that that extra money is for my salary.

All my female colleagues are now mad and call me an asshole because ""I stole the job from single mother"", and I am raising the cleints expectations too much.

For a while, I wasn't working because I was a SAHM and then once our child was old enough for school I started my own business, but wasn't making an income from it. Needless to say, his money was our only income throughout this time.

Now I am working full time and we have family living with us who will help us split all of our household bills. At first, it was rent in half and a portion of the other bills, as I was going to be home to help care for this family member, but I had to go back to work full time. I discussed with my family members where they wanted split rent in 3rd and I said I thought it would be fair, as long as we just all split everything in third.

I didn't discuss this with my partner before agreeing, because I did the math, and it's all the same anyway.

During this argument, I mindlessly said it's my money anyway, and it triggered tf out of him. I was saying that I can pat a third of everything cause that seems fair (not equitable) anyway. Well, he was so hung up on my word choice that it didn't matter that I was contributing to household bills (the obvious right thing to do) and kept saying his money is his money, not ours, and that he‚Äôs only going to contribute x amount of dollars to x bill, and that I think his money is ours and my money is mine.

Out of all the people, one female in particular decided to go bat shit on me.

*Me: ""ok well I won't inform you anymore, I sent this to you becuase I thought you would care""*

*Next Day*

*Me: ""I don't appreciate you making me feel like I'm an asshole becuase I was simply informing you of something I thought you wanted to know""*

*Her: "" Look, we don't even talk anymore and you think your life is so much worse than everyone else. You are just looking for people to feel sorry for you but I really dont!""*

Oh I went off like a dump truck driving through a nitroglycerin plant on her ass.
She was the only person who responded like this. One of my brothers and I hardly talk either but he called me as soon as he received the results I sent.

So now she has me thinking ITAH.

79,1f4nsuj,AITA for telling my friend his bro's a jerk,"Basically my short time friend who I'll call Derick, has been jumping to the defense of his little brother who I'll call Adam for a while which would be understandable if his brother wasn't being completely rude.

For context Adam has been on and off dating someone who I'll call Oscar and over a year ago Oscar cheated on Adam with who we'll call Mark. After Oscar cheated with Mark they started dating but after a while they broke up and Oscar started dating Adam again. Now Mark is a friend of mine and so when I learned about what had happened I of course told him what he did wasn't okay because I don't in any way condone cheating. When I told him that he told me that he realized now what he did was in no way okay and had apologized to Adam with full sincerity as well as going out of his way to leave Adam alone.

The thing about all this though is that when all of this happened Adam was really upset which is reasonable. But the thing about that is Adam wasn't just upset in silence or only telling Oscar that they were upset, when Adam was upset he would make it very loudly known. I get it, what happened hurt but tell me why even a year later with Adam and Oscar now being broken up again Adam still continues to be loudly and openly rude to Mark. When Adam began to be rude too Mark Oscar would always say that it's justified and we need to let it go but now that it's been over a year of this Oscar finally started to tell Adam that it's not okay for him to be bullying Mark like this. This confrontation leads to them breaking up once again as stated earlier because Adam is so set on the fact that he is completely justified in his boiling hatred and blatant bullying of Mark.

Through most of this process Derick was trying not to get pulled in but when Adam and Oscar just recently broke up Adam started being even ruder to Mark and now Oscar and started to post about it non-stop on twitter. This led to Oscar and Mark often talking about how Adam was being extremely rude and hearing this Derick began saying that Adam being an a hole was debatable and that we should just pipe down about it.

Derick keeps jumping to defend Adam and I got fed up and told him he needs to just stop because his brother is being rude. He told me that what happened was bad both from Oscar and Adam and I agree that it was and is toxic for both of them. The thing is though that doesn't mean his brother Adam get's to run around being rude to and constantly insulting others even after Oscar and Mark apologized just cause he feels like he's justified.

She ""wants to be a vet"" and is still in college. She is also Indian, like my doctor, and he clearly hired her because he's friends with her mom and now it's all our jobs to train her.

I actually got trained to be a vet tech and went to school for it, unlike a lot of the people I work with. Meaninwhile he just hired her because she's Indian and she's terrible at her job.

She wasn't refilling syringes, heart worm tests, etc, so I talked to her and she said she was ""never trained."" Yeah, right. I almost saw her giving a dog treats. I told her she's not allowed to do that, but she said ""the vet said it was fine."" It's clear she is terrible at her job, the dog would have an allergy.

I finally got tired of her because I passed her room multiple times and there was dog poop in the corner under a chair that I could clearly smell. I saw it multiple times and noticed she didn't clean it up. It really pissed me off.

I ignored it until I saw her bring a different client in that room with her dog. I found her in the supply room and yelled at her. I said it was a HUGE HEALTH VIOLATION to have shit on the floor. A patients dog could step in shit and get a worm or something worse. 

She immediately started apologizing and saying she's sorry and that she didn't notice there was shit on the floor. I asked if she was stupid? How could she not smell the dog shit even if she didn't see it? 

She said she has some condition where she can't smell anything. But she said she didn't notice. I told her that she has been super bad at her job, she should get in trouble for leaving shit on the ground and would if she wasn't family friends with the boss. I told her off and it felt really good.

Of course she went complaining to the boss, who told me to please talk to him if I have problems instead of getting into people myself. The thing is I knew he wouldn't say shit to her. He never does.

81,1f4nfoh,WIBTA if I don‚Äôt invite my aunt for making my sister have a panic attack at my engagement party?,"I (26m) had an engagement party last week that didn‚Äôt end well.

My sister Tanya (28f) went through a lot the last few years. She broke up with her fianc√© because he wanted to move to Georgia and she didn‚Äôt want to leave California. She also quit her nursing job and is now a flight attendant. 

This didn‚Äôt go well with the rest of our family at the time. Everyone was harassing her for what she did that she ended up cutting off contact for a while.

So my other sister threw an engagement party for me and my fianc√©e and invited everyone. And I mean everyone.

At one point, Tanya had a nervous breakdown. It took a while to calm her down but when we asked what happened, it turns out one of my aunts was harassing my sister and asking when she will grow up. Things like when she was going to settle down and go back to nursing. No one could calm her down and she had to leave early. 

I‚Äôm honestly really pissed at my aunt. She‚Äôs always been a helicopter aunt who can‚Äôt mind her own business but this time she took it too far.  

My sister had a mental health crisis thanks to her. 

When it‚Äôs time to send out the invites, I‚Äôm not planning on sending one to my aunt because what if she pulls this stunt again at the wedding? 

My mom, her sister, doesn‚Äôt agree. We don‚Äôt have a big family to begin with, and my aunt never had kids so she treats her niblings like the children she never had (ie controlling). She thinks that it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to exclude her when everyone else is invited.

My wife is on my side. My sister says that she doesn‚Äôt want to attend, and I‚Äôm going to respect that unless she says otherwise. My aunt, I am not interested in having because what if she does this again? My mom says if I don‚Äôt invite my aunt, then she might as well not come either to support her.

During the lockdown, our friends Kevin and Brandy decided to get separated, and a lot of awful stuff we didn‚Äôt know about came to the surface. They had a volatile marriage, she claims they all walked on eggshells due to his temper, there were accusations of cheating, etc. Both have hothead personalities, so I can believe this. 

Brandy aired her accusations to the wives of the group through our regular group chat, while Kevin mostly lamented about the breakup of his family to the guys. She claimed he was acting calm and sad because he is manipulative and wanted to make her look worse. This could be true, we obviously didn‚Äôt know him like we thought. Either of them, really. 

Here is where it gets tricky. My husband and I are very close to another couple in the group, Sam and Jenny. Sam is also Kevin‚Äôs best friend. 

Brandy decided to shut Sam and Jenny out of her life, and a couple of the other wives did as well. I wasn‚Äôt cool with that, since I am closest to Jenny. Brandy no longer kept me in her tight inner circle due to my friendship with Sam and Jenny, but I was ok with this. I was still friendly, tried to be as supportive as she let me, and never talked about her to Kevin. 

My husband and I mostly stopped seeing Kevin at all, unless he happened to be at Sam and Jenny‚Äôs at the same time. I‚Äôve probably seen Kevin 5 times in 4 years, but my husband has seen him more since they sometimes golf or surf together with Sam. My husband never discusses Brandy with him, out of respect. 

Kevin has been dating Caroline since about a year after the split. They became engaged last year. I have only met her a few times, but we are not friends because I don‚Äôt know her. She friend requested me recently on FB and I accepted. I have plenty of FB friends who are just acquaintances. 

A few weeks ago, Brandy posted a long FB rant about how she is going to clean house on FB of people who are ‚Äúplaying both sides‚Äù in spite of knowing all she and her kids have been through. I was like - whoa, I wonder who has done something to upset her! I had last talked to her a month ago, when I complimented a picture of her new haircut. 

I few days later, I noticed she was gone from my page. She had defriended me! The gravest of the millennial insults. She didn‚Äôt defriend my husband, which is bizarre. I sent her a text and told her I noticed she defriended me and asked why, but she never responded.

okay, i 17F and my best friends, 16F, met about 2.5 years ago. i don‚Äôt remember specifically how we were introduced to each other, but we instantly clicked and have been inseparable ever since. 

about 4 months ago, she got a bf, 17M (who is in my class). i was ecstatic for the both of them seeing as they‚Äôve liked each other for almost a year now, and i‚Äôd like to congratulate myself seeing as i feel that i played a little bit of matchmaker for the both of them. 
but in the most recent months she has become more and more distant because she has been hanging out with him more. that im completely okay with, they are in a pretty loving relationship and it‚Äôs understandable to hang out with your partner considerably more, me and my boyfriend 17M hang out loads too.

about 5 weeks ago she posted on her instagram story with an ‚Äúappreciation post thing/chain post template‚Äù as i‚Äôm going to call it.
the story was a photo of her and him and the caption said ‚Äúin honour of blonde hair day, post your favourite blonde‚Äù. (background information: both her bf and i are both blonde and she has brunette hair).
i didn‚Äôt say anything about the post when i saw it. i‚Äôm a pretty non confrontational person and, it does totally make sense why she posted it seeing as he is one of her favourite people. i just thought for something like this she would‚Äôve posted me too because we‚Äôve been there for each other forever. 
it‚Äôs not like she could‚Äôve forgot about me either because for once in quite a long time i had i good conversation with her over the phone. (the post was made within an hour of me getting off the phone with her.)
i was wasn‚Äôt to hurt because she is aloud there is nothing stopping her from posting him on her story, as she frequently does. i didn‚Äôt mention anything to her because i realty didn‚Äôt to hurt our friendship.

anyway, fast forward to now. the other day i posted a similar thing to what she had about my boyfriend (who is brunette just like her). my post was also a picture of him and i with the ‚Äúappreciation post/chain story‚Äù thing with the caption ‚Äúpost a brunette who makes you smile‚Äù
at this point i had completely forgotten about her post since it had been a month and didn‚Äôt think anything of it. 
when she saw the story she replied to it saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt i make you smile?!‚Äù. her message had a rude demeanour and i was caught off guard by what she had said. 
not wanting to create drama/problems between the two of us, i quickly deleted my story and made a collage with photos of the both of them.
my prior post excluding her had nothing to do with her post previously nor me getting revenge on her. i was just surprised when she almost snapped at me for something like that.

she hasn‚Äôt confronted the situation any more since i posted her too, but i have noticed that now she‚Äôs been more ignorant and blunt to me.

so AITA?

anyway, fast forward to now. the other day i posted a similar thing to what she had about my boyfriend (who is brunette just like her). my post was also a picture of him and i with the ‚Äúappreciation post/chain story‚Äù thing with the caption ‚Äúpost a brunette who makes you smile‚Äù
at this point i had completely forgotten about her post since it had been a month and didn‚Äôt think anything of it. 
when she saw the story she replied to it saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt i make you smile?!‚Äù. her message had a rude demeanour and i was caught off guard by what she had said. 
not wanting to create drama/problems between the two of us, i quickly deleted my story and made a collage with photos of the both of them.
my prior post excluding her had nothing to do with her post previously nor me getting revenge on her. i was just surprised when she almost snapped at me for something like that.

she hasn‚Äôt confronted the situation any more since i posted her too, but i have noticed that now she‚Äôs been more ignorant and blunt to me.

so AITA?

I have a group chat with 4 people who I consider some of my best friends. Tonight, things were going how they usually do where all four of us are laughing about some stupid stuff and suddenly one of us has to leave to go to sleep. The friend that leaves says their goodnights and after that, suddenly one of my friends (M) asks if his face or ‚Äúface card‚Äù has been looking good lately.

I say that his new hairstyle does make his face more visible and agree with the statement. After that, he says that he‚Äôs been getting many compliments lately (which I already know) because thats all he had been talking about the past week. He somewhat continues to gloat about it and I then say ‚Äúokay we get it bro‚Äù with a ‚Äúüò£‚Äù following to subtly downplay my statement. This is where the 3rd person in the group chat thats left comes in. Mind you, she has a crush on the guy. She then says ‚Äúwhat a hater‚Äù to my statement and the guy follows up with ‚Äúfuck off‚Äù and ‚Äúlet me have my moment‚Äù i then apologize and say ‚Äúokay sorry‚Äù because at this point I realized I probably look like a douche without context.

The convo then takes a sillier turn and they say that I wish I had the type of hair the guy has as a joke.

92,1f4l5ua,AITA for expecting my friend to pay ¬£400 for a trip she can no longer go on?,"I read these posts a lot and never thought I would be writing one but, it's almost 4am, I've been tossing and turning all night and I feel like writing everything here will somehow help. So here it goes...

We (me f28, my sister f26 and a group of her friends/family) are going away at the end of September for my Sister's hen party. We've been really excited about it and I have been doing a lot of the planning for when we get there. 

My best friend (f28) was also booked to come with us. Unfortunately, she has broken her foot playing sport and due to needing a surgery she is unable to attend now. She informed us of this yesterday, just 4 weeks before we go. 

The problem is she didn't pay the rest of her holiday off, she has said it was due to not having the correct bank details to transfer money to, unsure if this is true as she was able to transfer the deposit without issue. Anyway, my sister as the lead booker, paid her remaining ¬£400, she had no choice the deadline had come and the entire trip for everyone would've been cancelled if she hadn't. She paid this in good faith that she was getting the money back as my friend had said numerous times she would pay ""whatever needs paid"".

My sister has contacted the holiday company and they are unable to cancel my friends place without cancelling the entire booking (personally I haven't heard of this before but I also contacted the company and was told the same thing) the only way to get any money back is to complete a medical form and open a dispute with the complaints team. There is no guarantee of a full refund but we should be able to claim something. This process can take a minimum of 28 days and needs to be done by my friend as it requires all her medical details and it's her name on the booking etc.

My friend in the meantime is now refusing to pay my sister back the ¬£400 she paid because she doesn't want to pay for a holiday she can no longer go on. I get why she wouldn't want to but she agreed to go on this trip. She knew the costs involved. It's unfortunate what happened and that she needs a surgery (I've been very supportive and tried to comfort her over this) but when you commit to something you pay. I got into a heated discussion with her earlier via WhatsApp because she's refusing to even speak to me on the phone. She just keeps saying why should she be out money while simultaneously fully expecting my sister to be out the ¬£400 that she has been promising to pay for months. 

This whole situation has basically ruined the hen, my sister's been crying for two days because of the stress and I've been crying all day, I feel awful, I'm the one that invited my friend and I feel responsible. On top of that I'm losing my best friend for years.

94,1f4l05l,AITA for refusing to cover up a tattoo I have matching with my ex?,"I (24M) have been dating my current partner (23M), let's call him 'K', for 5 months. Before him, I was in a relationship with my ex (24F), let's call her 'L', which lasted 6 years and ended badly on both sides; this is a sensitive subject since K has BPD and has labeled me as his ""favorite person"", which means he can be very jealous/possessive sometimes, so I never bring her up with him to protect our peace.

I have a small tattoo above my ankle that matches with L. Nothing too personal at first glance, it's just thin linework of a flower (her choice), and I have good memories attached to it, regardless of how our relationship ended.

The issue is that K hadn't known about this tattoo, as I never thought it was important to bring it up with him. However, some days ago he happened to see it and got curious about it, asking why I kept it hidden (I didn't, it just happens to be in a place that's always covered in some way or another), and what it meant as I'm not a flower guy by any means. I felt bad about lying to him so I just told the truth, making sure to emphasize how it didn't mean the same to me anymore, but I still thought it was a nice tattoo.

K got very upset, went home, and then texted me demanding I get the tattoo covered up or removed, saying I wouldn't be hesitant about it if I cared about him, and that this clearly shows I haven't gotten over L. He even offered to pay for laser removal or a cover-up piece, and then insisted if I picked the cover-up, it had to be something matching with him now.

I explained I had no intention of removing it, laser sounds expensive and tedious, and I didn't want to get another tattoo over it either, since it'd have to be a bigger piece and I'm not a tattoo enthusiast, but to be honest, the main reason is that I just don't want to get another matching tattoo with anyone again.

I'm at a loss here, he's refusing to talk to me and texted me saying he doesn't want to see me unless it's to book an appointment together, I know this is probably his mental illness talking for him but he's never gotten this upset at me before. I'm used to talking him down from being extremely self-deprecating, but this I'm unequipped to deal with; I can't help but feel like an AH for not going along with it and letting things go back to normal since the issue is fully on me this time.

I (24M) have been dating my current partner (23M), let's call him 'K', for 5 months. Before him, I was in a relationship with my ex (24F), let's call her 'L', which lasted 6 years and ended badly on both sides; this is a sensitive subject since K has BPD and has labeled me as his ""favorite person"", which means he can be very jealous/possessive sometimes, so I never bring her up with him to protect our peace.

I have a small tattoo above my ankle that matches with L. Nothing too personal at first glance, it's just thin linework of a flower (her choice), and I have good memories attached to it, regardless of how our relationship ended.

The issue is that K hadn't known about this tattoo, as I never thought it was important to bring it up with him. However, some days ago he happened to see it and got curious about it, asking why I kept it hidden (I didn't, it just happens to be in a place that's always covered in some way or another), and what it meant as I'm not a flower guy by any means. I felt bad about lying to him so I just told the truth, making sure to emphasize how it didn't mean the same to me anymore, but I still thought it was a nice tattoo.

K got very upset, went home, and then texted me demanding I get the tattoo covered up or removed, saying I wouldn't be hesitant about it if I cared about him, and that this clearly shows I haven't gotten over L. He even offered to pay for laser removal or a cover-up piece, and then insisted if I picked the cover-up, it had to be something matching with him now.

I explained I had no intention of removing it, laser sounds expensive and tedious, and I didn't want to get another tattoo over it either, since it'd have to be a bigger piece and I'm not a tattoo enthusiast, but to be honest, the main reason is that I just don't want to get another matching tattoo with anyone again.

I'm at a loss here, he's refusing to talk to me and texted me saying he doesn't want to see me unless it's to book an appointment together, I know this is probably his mental illness talking for him but he's never gotten this upset at me before. I'm used to talking him down from being extremely self-deprecating, but this I'm unequipped to deal with; I can't help but feel like an AH for not going along with it and letting things go back to normal since the issue is fully on me this time.

So AITA?

Of course, she started crying once I took the cup away. Lainey immediately jumped in, saying that she's just a baby and doesn't know any better. When I told her that she knows exactly what she's doing, she said ""she's my kid, not yours, I'll decide how to discipline her"" and then proceeded to give her the cup back.

97,1f4k5ie,AITA for telling my best friend she‚Äôs delusional?,"My best friend and I have been close since we were five years old. Now, at 21 and 20, respectively, I've always admired her capacity for love and commitment. She‚Äôs known for being a ""lover girl,"" which is a wonderful trait. However, recently, I‚Äôve noticed that her enthusiasm for love seems to be becoming excessive. She tends to pursue any romantic opportunity, believing she can change any man, even when it‚Äôs clear that some relationships are just not meant to be.

A few months ago, she started seeing a new guy, and although I was initially happy for her, I began to notice some red flags. During a group outing, I observed him checking out other girls and chatting up the waitress when my friend was in the bathroom. When I mentioned this to her, she dismissed it as him just being friendly, though his behavior struck me as a bit too friendly. Later, I saw a Tinder notification on his phone while she was away, which was concerning given their serious status at the time. She brushed it off, suggesting it might be an old notification.

Two weeks later, when they became official, I noticed more suspicious behavior. While we were at a carnival, he kept checking his phone and logged out of a Snapchat account filled with unopened snaps, only to log into a blank account. Despite my concerns, she defended him, saying he doesn‚Äôt use Snapchat and that I might be mistaken.

My worries grew when we went to a restaurant together. While my friend was in the bathroom, I saw him discreetly hand a piece of paper to the waitress. When she returned, he claimed it was nothing and that she was imagining things. Despite his explanations, I felt uneasy. Later, I noticed a notification from RAYA on his phone, which surprised me because I didn‚Äôt understand how he got accepted on that platform.

When I shared these observations with her, she accused me of trying to break them up and claimed I was just jealous or biased. I reassured her that if he were genuinely a good guy, I would want nothing but the best for them both. My friend became very upset, and after our argument, she left and has not responded to my messages. I feel frustrated and hurt by her reaction. Am I in the wrong here?

When she threw me out she cut me off my depression medication and it was really rough for a few months afterwards a long with trying to pull me out of highschool.

Over time our relationship got better but it always made me feel nervous to be around her even when she was being nice or comforting. It's caused me to get really withdrawn from a lot of authority figures in my life in fear they'd blow up on me like she did and continues to do.

However I recently started a new semester at college and my father often causes a mess he doesn't clean up when I'm gone more then a few days, mostly due to his drinking.

So for context, I am a male 20 year old and I don't have the best relationship with either of my parents. When I was 16 my mom threw me out cause of my grades slipping during covid-19, combined that with a lot of depression and anxiety and you get the recipe for someone whod lie often due to the explosive nature of their mom, often her yelling going on for hours. When she threw me out she cut me off my depression medication and it was really rough for a few months afterwards a long with trying to pull me out of highschool.

Over time our relationship got better but it always made me feel nervous to be around her even when she was being nice or comforting. It's caused me to get really withdrawn from a lot of authority figures in my life in fear they'd blow up on me like she did and continues to do.

Cut to recently where she wanted me to watch her dog, something I've done before in the past. However I recently started a new semester at college and my father often causes a mess he doesn't clean up when I'm gone more then a few days, mostly due to his drinking. I tried my best to avoid the question by stalling but eventually I just told her I probably couldn't cause of the things going on in my life, mainly due to again my father. She tries to guilt trip me by claiming all the things she's done and eventually I snap just texting back ""then don't ask me. If your going to react this way when I say no then don't ask, and I won't ask for anything in return"". She then looses it calling me disrespectful, acting like a teenager, ungrateful, the usual sort of insults I'm used to even when I do speak the truth.

I work at a large chain of restaurants and make decent pay for a part time job in the area ($15 an hour before training with up to $17 an hour within my first year.) he has never held a job before besides working under the table at 13 for about 6 months. I keep bothering him to get a part time job so we can start saving for the future and he is never interested in that idea and it turns into an argument. Usually when we argue about things we always figure it out within a few hours but this has been an ongoing thing for months. I told him he could work with me at my place in various positions so that he would feel comfortable there.

I was highly upset with her. Especially because she did that when we were with my daughter. I told her I didn't appreciate that and if money was an issue I would have paid for it and asked her to please never do that again. Fast forward to last week.
She came over to visit. I had an expensive bottle of skincare I was gifted for my birthday. I was showing it to her and telling her about it. I had mentioned if I end up not using it or liking it, she's welcomed to have it.
Today I go looking for it. I can't find it ANYWHERE. I texted her and asked if she took it or remembers where I put it. She said no and then immediately sent 4 texts in a row over explaining where it could be and then randomly says ""that's something my mom would buy lol."" And then keeps saying it will ""show up somewhere."" I told her I just wanted to know if she had already taken it because I told her she could have it IF I didn't like it or use it. She replied with ""I forgot you said I could have it."" And then changes the subject completely. I love my friend dearly, but with her track record I can't help but think she stole it from me.

I am struggling right now because I don't have any evidence she took it and I hate that my first reaction is that she took it.

Put my at a dinner party and I am a charming bugger, put me in a loud party with more than 20 and I'm gonna find a tiny corner to hide on my phone without being seen so I don't appear rude.

Unfortunately this story is a rooftop party with 56 people. My girlfriend is friends with quite a lot of them, and I have only met some in passing. My girlfriend was really excited and asked that I attend with me, I said sure, but she needs to be around me for a fair bit to help break the ice. She said sure. We get there and she starts drinking pretty quickly, I don't like how I feel when I drink so i only had one beer for a pleasant buzz. I ask her if theres anybody there I could gel with, and she asks me if its OK If I could hold my own for a bit while she catches up with her friends. I say sure. I go into my corner, and 20 minutes later text her where she is. She sends me an incoherent text, my best guess as to what it was was to find a couple of guys named Dave and Bob. Something like that.

My interest dies, and I just say I'm gonna go as (there was a metal concert nearby that would have been far more interesting to attend) I find the host and he is talking with someone else and he mentions he has a room filled with birds.

Now there is some backstory, not everything because that would reveal a lot. 

Getting down to it, I just recently got engaged and I have the dilemma of trying to figure out how to tell my bio dad he is not the one walking me down the aisle. He told me in a previous unrelated conversation prior to me getting engaged that he would disown me and never speak to me again if he wasn't the one walking me down the aisle. So this obviously puts me in a position of how do I tell him without hurting my sibling. And not only that AITA for not wanting someone who never raised me to walk me down?

I'm a 35-year-old man, and my wife and I have a 2-year-old daughter who has made a close friend at daycare. Recently, my wife has become friendly with this friend's mom, and they‚Äôve invited us over to their house for a swim.

Here‚Äôs the thing: I‚Äôm pretty overweight (190lbs at 5.10 height and)and I‚Äôve always been self-conscious about my body. While I have swum before at public places on holiday, I usually try to avoid situations where I‚Äôm around people I don‚Äôt know very well, especially if they‚Äôre very fit, like this couple. It makes me feel even more uncomfortable.

I told my wife that I‚Äôll come to their house but that I won‚Äôt swim. She got frustrated and said that‚Äôs stupid and that no one will care about how I look. She also said I should do it for our daughter because she loves swimming and would enjoy it more if I was in the pool with her.

I get where she‚Äôs coming from, but I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable in this situation. I think I should be allowed to set my own boundaries, but my wife seems to think I‚Äôm making a big deal out of nothing and should just suck it up.

115,1f4ib91,AITAH for calling my bf‚Äôs dad a creep because he calls him baby boy?,"The situation is so bad I have to turn to reddit for advice. I (22f) have been dating my bf (21m) for two years. We met in Uni through shared friends and immediately hit it off. All of our interests align and he‚Äôs genuinely the most intelligent, mature, kind man I know. For some context, my bf comes from a much wealthier background than me. He was raised by his father after his mom‚Äôs death, so they are very close. My bf is an exceptionally good looking boy, like smtg out of a renaissance painting. Unfortunately, this has caused him severe problems with men (I won‚Äôt go into detail). He has been in therapy since he was 6, but he still gets easily triggered by anything concerning mlm. For example, he can‚Äôt stand hearing about Oscar Wilde. He‚Äôs doing his best to overcome his trauma and I am very proud of him.

Here‚Äôs the issue. My bf still lives with his dad since his house is near campus. They‚Äôre strapped at the hip unless he‚Äôs in class or with me. I immediately noticed how touchy he was with my bf, who always starts acting like a kid whenever he‚Äôs around. I‚Äôm talking constant cuddles, kisses, rubs, etc. I have nothing against this, since I come from a culture where we‚Äôre very affectionate with family members. My problem is that he always calls him his baby boy. I thought it was just a cute nickname, but he seriously uses it in public. We have gotten weird looks in restaurants and waiters have confused my bf for a sugar baby multiple times. It makes me really uncomfortable when they do that in public, and use a sort of childish, whiny voice when they speak with each other. The last straw was when my parents flew over to visit me. We planned a nice dinner for everyone to meet, and I kindly asked my bf to be on his best behaviour since my parents are old school and religious. The dinner was really awkward and my parents were visibly uncomfortable. I didn‚Äôt want to say anything at first because I know that my bf is extremely attached to his dad who was his only support and friend for a long time.

A few days after dinner, we were casually talking when he mentioned that he felt like my parents didn‚Äôt seem welcoming at all, and that he felt that they were judging him for being white (I am from the levant). The words came out of my mouth before I could stop them. I said that my parents were weirded out by his creepy father. He got really upset and stormed out on me. It‚Äôs been a few days and he still refuses to speak or answer my texts. I feel really bad for being so blunt, he is the love of my life and I think he needs to know that his behaviour is not acceptable in public for his own good. I know he adores his father and that he needs this kind of affection, and I fully support him. I just don‚Äôt want him to embarrass himself. AITAH?



Edit :
I just wanted to clarify some things 

1) my bf has severe social anxiety and panic attacks. He‚Äôs a relatively isolated person. He‚Äôs known in uni as the weird guy. Ppl who don‚Äôt knows he‚Äôs with his father gossip a lot and say that he‚Äôs a boy toy, a sugar baby, a wh*ore, etc. This has really hindered his ability to make friends and ostracised him even more. This is really bad for his mental health and recovery. His therapist and I agree on this. The more people talk, the more isolated and closed up he becomes.

2) my bf likes to be taken care of, babied and praised in bed. I don‚Äôt call him baby boy, but he requests something very similar. I don‚Äôt mind at all. I think it‚Äôs his trauma talking and I do my best to make him comfortable. 

3) My bf and his father are regulars at this restaurant near campus where a friend of mine works. They‚Äôre known as ""the old man and his sugar baby"" there, according to her. Waiters gossip among themselves. She thinks it‚Äôs funny, I do not. I have heard on a separate occasion, in a different place, two waiters gossiping about this when I was on my way to the bathroom. This is not an isolated incident. We get looks from both staff and customers wherever we go. It‚Äôs a fact, not projection. 



Update :
Thank you all for your feedback, even those who said that I‚Äôm already single atp. Sorry to disappoint, but we are still very much together and in love. This will probably be my last update:

My bf called me a few hours after I posted this and invited me to talk. I went over to his house. We had a long conversation. We both cried a lot. Long story short, my bf said that he knows that his behaviour is inappropriate in public. Due to his social anxiety, he finds himself panicking in social settings and immediately reverts back to his safe space, aka his relationship with his father. He is aware of how he is perceived and what people say about him, but he‚Äôs stuck in a loop where he‚Äôs terrified of interacting with people so he copes as best as he knows but his coping mechanism makes him even more of a pariah and that adds on to his terror. He said that he got really upset with me because I put the blame on his father and painted him in a bad light for something he initiates. He‚Äôs also scared that my parents would encourage me to break up with him because they might think his trauma makes him ‚Äòless of a man‚Äô and he doesn‚Äôt fit my culture‚Äôs masculinity standards. I admit that while they didn‚Äôt say anything about trauma, they did question my choice of partner and expressed concerns that I immediately shut down. I explained to him that I was completely supportive of his coping mechanism in private, but it did make me uncomfortable in public which he agrees with and understands. I assured him that I didn‚Äôt care what other people thought of him (including my parents) and that he is the love of my life and I loved everything about him. 
Unfortunately, he told me that he had been planning on proposing this year, but due to this incident, he realized that he still had a lot of baggage to work through before he could be a good husband and eventually father. I agreed, and we will be going to couple‚Äôs counseling. His father then joined the conversation, and we had a heart to heart talk about trauma, recovery, ptsd, social expectations, and the future. 
I feel like my relationship is stronger than ever after this much needed talk. I fell in love with my partner all over again and I can‚Äôt wait to build a future with him.

My husband pressed me to ask if my mom if someone else could watch her dog so that I could attend the event with him. I agreed to mention the event to her, just in case there was some other back up plan that could work, but made it clear that since I had already agreed to watch her dog, I would be doing that, unless she was comfortable with an alternate plan. 


I mentioned it, and she called to next day to say that she may have found a dog sitter who would come and stay at her house with both dogs (hers and mine). It was clear that she was nervous about this change, but she was willing to do it for me. I mentioned that I could make other arrangements for my dog, but my mom said that she‚Äôd feel better if the dogs were together, since they grew up together, similar age, both low energy now, and both familiar with her house/yard (no stairs/fenced). We discussed a time for me to bring my dog over to meet the dog sitter, to make sure all was well before agreeing, and hung up.


I excitedly told my husband that my mom was still nervous, but found something that might work; and explained the dog sitter. He said he would feel more comfortable if our dog stayed with his mom instead of a sitter. He had not asked his mom if she could take our dog, and his mom has had knee issues recently, and has a 3 year old high-energy dog of her own.


I‚Äôm not saying that my MIL couldn‚Äôt take amazing care of my dog for a few days, just that we had a solution, where my mom was comfortable if my dog stayed with hers. I told him that if my mom trusted this person to live inside her house, and watch her high-needs dog, that it should be okay.


He waited until I went downstairs, and then called his mom, to ask if she could watch our dog, and she agreed. Then, he came down and told me that if I‚Äôm going to the event, the only place he would allow our dog to go is to his mom‚Äôs, because he refuses to ‚Äúleave her with a stranger‚Äù. He refused to meet the dog sitter, and when I said it doesn‚Äôt feel right to bail and expect my mom to do something with her dog, that he refuses to do with ours, he said I was ‚Äúoverthinking it‚Äù


I told him that unless he had some other solution for the care of both dogs, I will stay behind. Now he won‚Äôt talk to me unless it‚Äôs to accuse me of not wanting to go, or if not caring about our dog

I agreed to mention the event to her, just in case there was some other back up plan that could work, but made it clear that since I had already agreed to watch her dog, I would be doing that, unless she was comfortable with an alternate plan. 


I mentioned it, and she called to next day to say that she may have found a dog sitter who would come and stay at her house with both dogs (hers and mine). It was clear that she was nervous about this change, but she was willing to do it for me. I mentioned that I could make other arrangements for my dog, but my mom said that she‚Äôd feel better if the dogs were together, since they grew up together, similar age, both low energy now, and both familiar with her house/yard (no stairs/fenced). We discussed a time for me to bring my dog over to meet the dog sitter, to make sure all was well before agreeing, and hung up.


I excitedly told my husband that my mom was still nervous, but found something that might work; and explained the dog sitter. He said he would feel more comfortable if our dog stayed with his mom instead of a sitter. He had not asked his mom if she could take our dog, and his mom has had knee issues recently, and has a 3 year old high-energy dog of her own.


I‚Äôm not saying that my MIL couldn‚Äôt take amazing care of my dog for a few days, just that we had a solution, where my mom was comfortable if my dog stayed with hers. I told him that if my mom trusted this person to live inside her house, and watch her high-needs dog, that it should be okay.


He waited until I went downstairs, and then called his mom, to ask if she could watch our dog, and she agreed. Then, he came down and told me that if I‚Äôm going to the event, the only place he would allow our dog to go is to his mom‚Äôs, because he refuses to ‚Äúleave her with a stranger‚Äù. He refused to meet the dog sitter, and when I said it doesn‚Äôt feel right to bail and expect my mom to do something with her dog, that he refuses to do with ours, he said I was ‚Äúoverthinking it‚Äù


I told him that unless he had some other solution for the care of both dogs, I will stay behind. Now he won‚Äôt talk to me unless it‚Äôs to accuse me of not wanting to go, or if not caring about our dog


So, AITA for saying we use the dog sitter or I‚Äôm not going to the event? ",0.0,0.04931045323610306,0,1
119,1f4hikl,AITA for not wanting to send my family a birthday wishlist?,"Every year before my birthday or Christmas my mum/family ask me for a list of things I want, but when I give gifts I don't ask them for one as it seems disingenuous.

120,1f4hike,AITA at the dog park?,"I was at the dog park today with my 6 mo old Great Pyrenees. He is a shockingly calm, very friendly boy. It was just him and I running around at our usual, fairly small and quiet dog park today when three women, a young child, and their dog arrived. 

I held my dog as they entered to give them some space and not overwhelm them, but they kept their dog on the leash and started walking around the dog park. My dog was excited to have a friend to play with, but since it looked like they might be letting the dog get comfortable in a new environment, I continued to hold him for a few minutes. 

Eventually, they sat down at a bench not far from us with their dog still in the leash. My dog started barking out of excitement, and I - still holding his collar - yelled out, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs super friendly, he just wants to play‚Ä¶ does your dog want to play?‚Äù The woman holding the dog responded that she wasn‚Äôt sure, probably not and she‚Äôd prefer to keep some distance. I responded, ‚Äúwell‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs a dog park and I don‚Äôt want to keep holding him‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to make you or your dog uncomfortable but I brought him here to run around and play‚Äù

She started approaching with her dog and asked if I thought it‚Äôd be okay. I responded that she knows her dog best, and asked whether if her dog had met other dogs before - she responded no, that her dog was a house dog. I don‚Äôt know what that means. Our dogs sniffed each other for about a minute and then the women and their dog decided to leave. They went out into the open part of the park and started playing with their dog off-leash there.

AITA?? Should my dog be trained to leave other dogs alone at the dog park? Should she not bring her dog to the dog park if she doesn‚Äôt want it to interact with other dogs??
