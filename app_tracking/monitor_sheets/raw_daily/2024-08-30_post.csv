0,1f4uvbe,AITA for calling my mom selfish for trying to change who I am?,"I (17M) was outed to my mom (30sF) as trans awhile ago. At first, she seemed really support, she helped me buy me a binder and she helped me pick out a more masculine first name.

Recently she told me that I didn't have to ""waste money"" on my binder, because a tight sports bra would've done the same. I told her it wouldn't, and she argued with me, resulting on her forcing me to try it. Spoiler alert, it didn't work and I got mad at her while she js tried to convince me it did. I told her you could obviously see my chest and she said ""you always can, you just feel like people can't."" I took a lot of offense to this.

A few days after this we were talking about something I don't really remember, & it ended up with her asking me why I tried to look so much like a guy, I told her it was bcs I'm trans.

She told me. ""Well, don't you need surgery to be trans?"" I figured it was just because she was 30, & raised Christian so she didn't understand the whole thing. I told her no, and that I was still a guy pre-surgery & explained to her how that wasn't how it worked. She asked me how I was a guy if I still had my chest, and no male genitals. I told her being trans is much more than just genitals. She proceeded to say I was just a ""wannabe."" I took major offense to that and told her to not call me that because this is something I actually struggle with & this is who I was. I told her that I didn't want to talk to her anymore about this, and she apologized.

A couple days ago. We were in the car, and we were talking about me wanting to look like a guy again. She told me ‚ÄúI didnt have to be trans to look like a guy."" I told her it wasn't just about me LOOKING like a guy, it's about me BEING a guy.

She asked me why I couldn't just look ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and be trans, l asked her what she meant by ""Normal"" and she told me something around ""you know, not masc name but birth name."" I was taken back. I told her that me being who I was before wasnt ""normal"" to ME.

I've still been mad at her for the past few days, and anytime she mentions me being trans, I just go silent and ignore her.
last night she asked me why I was so mad at her, or kept ignoring her. I told her because anytime we talk about me, she makes me fee dehumanized, or like im not me. She told me that she wasn't doing any of that and shes just trying to ""help"". I told her she was and trying to change me isn‚Äôt helping at all. She told me that she's the one who knows better for me. I called her selfish, and that she's only trying to change me for her benefits of not having a trans child.
