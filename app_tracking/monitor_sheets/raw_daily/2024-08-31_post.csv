0,1f5zrsj,AITA for taking my earring out in a piercing place to make sure the piece I was buying was compatible?,"I have an industrial bar piercing I’ve had for over 20 years. Recently, I had to get a dental xray and they made me take it out and I must have not screwed the ball in right because I noticed the other day it was gone.   

Called the place that sold me this particular bar and they said if I could get there in about 5 minutes (they were closing I think) they could see if they had the ball for this bar. 

When they were looking at my ear I took my hand and bent my ear so they could see the back on it and they said “no no no don’t do that, it’s cross contamination.” I didn’t* really understand what exactly I’d be cross contaminating from touching my ear. I also scratched my forehead and my elbow in there but this didn’t seem to bother them. They put hand sanitizer on my hands and we moved on.   

As I was checking out I said I would like to buy two, just in case I lost one again, but also knew they said they weren’t positive that the one they showed me was the proper size. I then asked if they were returnable if the sizes don’t match, which they said no. So I asked if they were sure it was the right size and they said they can’t say 100% positive. So I slipped the bar out so I could see if the ball on the top of mine looked like the one in the bag.  

The way these two people reacted to this was as if I had just spit all over their store.   

“We take cross contamination very seriously here you can’t do that don’t do that I can’t believe you’ve done this,” etc. They then put hand sanitizer on me again with the disdain of a thousand villains in their eyes.   

I said I would just take one ball if they can’t guarantee it’s the right size and won’t honor a return if they were wrong. I controlled myself but the level of eye roll that wanted to come to surface was powerful. 

I worked in EMS and being good about disinfecting work spaces and PPE (Personal protective equipment) was suffice in controlling a germy environment.

1,1f5zhhi,AITAH for telling my Mom I don’t need help moving in to college?,"TLDR ; Mom and I have a back and forth relationship and I feel she’s almost always causing the problem.

Recently I (19 male, her son) have begun packing for college, and many years of my life under my parents has been either verbally abusive, humiliating or tense. My parents constantly tell me I should strive for independence, which whenever I do, I feel they rip the rug from under me by finding something to yell about (you’re not working enough hours, you didn’t try hard enough, you shouldn’t be into boxing etc) so I have been trying to stand up for myself when it’s reasonable.

I was in the kitchen when my mom said “We’ll help you pack” and I responded, as I have before multiple times, “I don’t need help, I can do it myself” she responded “Ok, then I’m not coming, dad can drive you” so I said “I just need help with one heavy container, I don’t need help with any of the other stuff”

She turned to my dad and said, “do you understand what he’s saying? i dont even understand?” And she scoffed, and I just walked into the garage to pack the heavy box myself.

Unfortunately now she’s ignoring me, and this happens probably on a monthly basis where I show them I’m seeking independence and it’s immediately crushed by “Oh ok, guess you don’t need me”, or some other annoying comment, and a combination of my mom ignoring me before i apologize for it and she cries in front of me and trauma dumps, listing off times I have been rude to her. My mom mentioned my mental health history in front of my counselor at college a year ago and I was extremely hurt by that, she said it in front of everyone and the man gave me a weird face. I feel she just runs her mouth and later she told me that I WAS the asshole for walking away “you didn’t even want to be near us” (I was talking to my advisor instead to plan my courses)… 

I feel like I’m going nuts and my friends can’t help me, sometimes I am too angry and I blow up on her because I let her do this constantly until I’m stressed about it and a combination of my life issues, so I feel like there’s some validity to it?

2,1f5z9x4,AITA for not inviting my stepmom to my wedding?,"throwaway account

My fiancee, 25 F, and I, 24 F, have been together for the last 9 years (highschool sweethearts). She had proposed to me two years ago, but we've had to continuously push the wedding back because of financial issues. Finally, we were able to pay and plan everything for October 27th of this year, and sent the invitations out July 14th. 

I have had low contact with my father's side of the family since I was 16 and he kicked me out, then replacing me with his now wife. I had only seen him over summers up until I was 19 when I stopped seeing him all together, except for a couple short weekend visits here and there. Needless to say, my relationship with him and my stepmother is strained and uncomfortable. My stepmother and I would constantly butt heads, and she was necessarily cruel to both me and my younger brother, 19M, though he continues to live with them now.  

When I was 18 they had another kid together, which is the main reason I stopped visiting. 

Now, the problem escalates even further with the way my stepmother treats my fiancee. My fiancee is Mexican, and combined with us being queer, she has been nothing but nasty with both of us, but especially her. 

It came down to the fact of she could not be around my fiancee, and with the way she treats both her and myself, I didn't send an invitation for her to our wedding, only my father and brother, telling them I would love for my sister, now 6, to be a flower girl of sorts. 

A few days after the invitation arrived, I get a nasty call from my stepmother about how I purposely excluded her to make her feel bad, and my dad backed her up, saying that since I invited my stepfather, she needed to be there too, and that if she couldn't come, he wouldn't either. 

I tried to reason with my dad, but he insisted that she had to come, and how I was such a ""terrible daughter for excluding the woman he loves"", and he even got most of his side of the family to back them up as well. 

My fiancee has insisted that I'm not at fault, and that I should just let them not come, but I want my family. She has a huge family, and they're all supportive, so I don't expect her to understand, but I really want my dad, I want him to walk me down the aisle, I want him to dance with me, and I want my sister in the wedding too. 

Truly, if I ata, then I will invite her, but I'm worried about her causing drama with my fiancee's family or with my mom's side. ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-31,"AITA for not inviting my stepmom to my wedding? throwaway account

3,1f5z8ac,AITA for taking risks to live my life how I want? ,"I (19F) come from a culturally strict muslim family, and although I’ve been raised in the U.K. (we live here) I’m expected to hold the same cultural and religious values - get a degree and be married “in the next 3-4 years” (their words) to a muslim man of my culture and settle down etc. 

I attended Quran classes 3 days a week since I was 5. My parents were really strict with praying. On days with no class, mum would tell me to read Quran for 1h at home, occasionally telling me I wouldn’t get dinner until I done it (don’t think it ever happened). They were never strict about hijabs, said it was my choice so I never wore one. 

I’ve told my parents on 2 separate occasions that I’m not religious. Essentially I just find the inconsistencies really off putting, I don’t need a book/god/threat of eternal burning to know right and wrong. 

First time I told them I was a young kid so they put me in more intense classes that included islamic studies, 5 days a week for a few years until covid. 
During those classes I became quite devout, as you’d expect a teen to be when being preached religion for 2h a day. When classes stopped I ended up returning to my previous beliefs about religion not being for me.

I told my mum again a few weeks ago, she said it was never guaranteed that I’d end up muslim, that she loves me more than ever. I told her that she’s saying that now, but she won’t feel the same in 2 weeks time.
I was right cuz last week she kept telling me to pray. When I stared at her flabbergasted, she acted as if she said nothing wrong. Just so hurtful to initially act one way and then flip cuz u decide u don’t want to accept it. 

Both parents act like I never said anything, preaching religion to me. I respect their beliefs, covering my head when they ask, dressing modestly, even when I’m not under their roof I don’t drink (despise the taste and feeling), do drugs, vape or smoke. 

I do have a bf 20M, been with him for a couple months now. It’s difficult cuz I have to sneak around, be home for 7pm curfew, knowing that there’d be colossal issues if I was found out. My dad last year heard rumours of me being with a boy, he came home threatening some incredibly unpleasant things that would violate rules to mention. 
Ask why I’m taking risks for a man- he makes me incredibly happy, does his best to help with my issues, making sure I’m home on time, endorsing my no-PDA rule and even coming up with a safe word in case I spot family when we’re in public. I’ve made him very aware that the risks could potentially extend to him, but he’s an adult so it’s his choice. 

Ask why I still live with my parents, theyre using my sister (13F) as blackmail to make me to stay, cuz it’s dishonourable for daughters to move out before marriage. They will do anything to keep me and wouldn’t even kick me out if I tried.

She was known as a bop, someone that would try to take your man and cheat, etc. And it's true. Multiple of her friends stopped talking to her because she flirted with their boyfriends, and she also cheated on multiple of her boyfriends.

She basically had no friends and had a terrible reputation because of it. We're in college now, but I am wary of her because of how she was.

My bf and I talked about it and he said those were all hateful rumors, that people made up shit about her because they didn't like her and ruined her reputation. I know this wasn't true, but I didn't want to get into it because his sister hangs out and comes over often.

One night she came over and I mentioned the HS days. I was telling her fun stories and she was talking about how she had no friends. We were really high but I was surprised when she said it was her fault. She said she craved male attention and betrayed a lot of friends/partners because of it. She said she lies to people and says it was lies, but it wasn't and she did that.

I was glad that she acknowledged it and said she can be a better person now, in college, and I told her to never betray her friends like that again. She said she wouldn't, she had no friends and was lonely, and she doesn't want to end up like that again.

But anyway I don't like her, but I'm fine with her and I don't mind when she comes over. My bf and I are going out of state for the weekend and he said we should bring his sister.

I said I wasn't comfortable with that because I didn't trust her around my friends bfs. She might say she's changed, but I don't know. My bf said it was all lies and that she's a good person.

We dated for a few months but that quickly ended due to the fact he cheated on me, other thing is we didn’t live in the same country since he lived in my home country and I live in the states. 

After I found out he cheated I forgave him the first time which was my mistake since he did it again, after that I broke it off with him and then we stopped talking. Now his mother was always quite pushy about our relationship, his mother had always pushed us close since we were kids. Later when we did start dating he told the reason she did that was so I could get married to him and bring him to the states.

When me and my ex broke it off she told me to just to forgive him since “boys will be boys”, I told her that I have respect for her but also myself and I wouldn’t be getting back with him. Currently my ex died a few weeks back, it was unexpected since it was in a car accident. When he died I felt sad and a bit heart broken since before we were even dating he was my friend, the morning he died his mom called me as she told me the news, then I told her I’ll call her when I get home since I needed to get to school.

When she said that I went quiet before I asked her what she meant if we weren’t even together and he made he obviously that he didn’t want to date me ever again, when I said that she said she felt as if I was being a bit unreasonable.

 When she said that I felt a bit annoyed as I told her maybe she should discuss this with my ex’s girlfriend he had before he died, she then was confused and said why if she wasn’t the one that was suppose to marry him in the future. That’s when I told her that either was I since what he did to me was a unforgivable and how he did more things to me after we broke up, she got upset as she told me a few things and I just hung up.

When she said that I went quiet before I asked her what she meant if we weren’t even together and he made he obviously that he didn’t want to date me ever again, when I said that she said she felt as if I was being a bit unreasonable.

 When she said that I felt a bit annoyed as I told her maybe she should discuss this with my ex’s girlfriend he had before he died, she then was confused and said why if she wasn’t the one that was suppose to marry him in the future. That’s when I told her that either was I since what he did to me was a unforgivable and how he did more things to me after we broke up, she got upset as she told me a few things and I just hung up. When I told my sister this she felt as if I was being unreasonable and told me to just play along with his mother since he is dead.

8,1f5yrxy,AITA for making my neighbours think I’m in a cult ,"

Hi throw away account cause I don’t want my friends to find this. I (24M) am a huge fan of board games, particularly Dungeons & Dragons. I host weekly D&D sessions at my apartment with a group of friends, and it's been our tradition for the last five years. We get into it—we dress up, light candles, chant dramatic incantations, we play some ambient music.I know it’s more that the regular player but we like it and find it funny 

Recently, my neighbors (an older couple in their 60s) moved in next door. They’re nice enough, but pretty old-school. Anyway, they’ve been giving me these weird looks lately and avoiding me in the hallway, which I thought was odd. But I figured maybe they just weren’t into socializing.

Well, last Saturday, during one of our sessions, we got *really* into it. My friend Dave (23M) was doing an epic monologue as the evil sorcerer we were about to defeat, and I may have been waving around a fake sword while wearing a hooded cloak, I was cosplaying my rouge character. We were deep in the moment when I heard a knock on the door. 

I opened it, still in costume, and was greeted by my very concerned-looking neighbors. Before I could say anything, the wife blurted out, “We’ve seen the people coming and going, the chanting, the cloaks, the swords—we just want to make sure everything is...okay?”

I was caught off guard and, without thinking, I blurted out, “Oh, we’re just summoning demons. Nothing to worry about!” And then I laughed because, obviously, I was joking.

They did not laugh. In fact, they looked even more horrified. They just mumbled something about being good Christians and backed away slowly.

Fast forward to the next morning, and I find a pamphlet slipped under my door for a “cult deprogramming service.” They even included a handwritten note offering to introduce me to their pastor “to save my soul.”

Now, my friends think this is hilarious and keep suggesting we lean into it, like start wearing robes to take out the trash or chant in the hallways. I’m honestly tempted to mess with them a bit, but I’m also kind of worried I’ve legitimately freaked them out.

9,1f5ya6n,AITA for how my friendship with my ex-bestfriend ended?,"Sorry, this is so long!

Ok so going right into it I have been stressing and lingering on this ever since we stopped talking and I can't help but feel like it was my fault. Is it?

It started at camp. I was initially not planning on going to a summer camp at all but she told me her mom last minute signed her and this girl she knows up for a summer camp and we plotted to have me sign up as well because she told me she does particularly enjoy spending time with her friend.

For context she once told me her friend, let's call A, went to a party and some people at the party said something horrible about my her, and all A did was laugh. Also, she told me that A has lied to her on numerous occasions, which I think is because she was jealous of me and her hanging out all the time so A lied about her old friend dying. Then she told me she found out her password and logged into A's phone to only find all the things about the dead friend were a lie and ON TOP OF ALL OF IT, A was also texting her almost ex-boyfriend... On and on and on.

Back to the story... I signed up for camp to spend time with her and A was on the phone for mostly the whole time anyway so I didn't think much of it. But as we neared the last couple of days of camp she decided to spend more time with A. Idk, Idc I didn't think much of it so I hung out with some other friends from camp. Then on the last day of camp, she and A were acting weird, and this isn't me being jealous at all they were so cliquey and if I sat down they sat down like a foot behind me giggling and taking pictures of me. I got annoyed and tired of it so I gave them the cold shoulder and then left. Here is what surprised me she did not text me or send me any of the regular videos she usually did. She stopped talking to me and I wanted her to reach out but she just didn't, on the other hand, I didn't reach out either.

Then, a mutual friend invited me to sleep over and I arrived late but as soon as I got there she was just acting weird. She was not talking to me and when my other friend left the room she immediately went to her phone and was not talking to me or anything. Then right before we went night swimming she out of the blue got a bad headache and said she had to go. I later texted her asking if she was mad at me to break the silence. and she responded with, ""u have been ignoring me and being distant for like a week now so idk r u mad at me for something?"" it was just a back and forward from there and she just kept defending herself and she didn't once apologize or anything. The whole thing ticks me off and I am just too angry to text her. She does not seem interested in being friends anymore and it makes me question whether she was my best friend at all.

11,1f5y919,AITA for asking my wife to talk to me respectfully?,"I (33m) don’t like the way my wife (32f) talks to me about some things because she talks to me like a child or is disrespectful.

Context: I help out plenty around the house and with my stepson. We have a set of responsibilities that we agreed upon. For example, she cooks, I do dishes and clean the kitchen. Cleaning the bathrooms is one of her responsibilities. She has more around the house because she doesn’t work and I do. 

The other day, I was already doing dishes and I asked her if she could put the leftovers in the fridge so I could wash the pots. She responded “that is not my job!” I didn’t say anything in the moment and did it myself. The next day, when she was making dinner, she asked for my help chopping some veggies. I helped, because it’s not a big deal.

She deep cleaned the bathroom yesterday. We had dinner plans and I had to pick up my stepson from school, rush home to shower and get ready. The second I was ready, we left to dinner, and didn’t get back until after our usual bedtime. 

This morning, she saw that there were some hairs from me on the counter in the bathroom. She grabbed a paper towel and said, in an condescending tone, “when you do your hair, you know that you can take a paper towel, wipe them up, and put them in the trash?” And then demonstrated the action and said something like “see? Easy”

I responded with “you can ask me to clean them up. But I don’t appreciate you talking to me as if I don’t understand how to take a hair off a counter” and she said “I don’t know if you know how to do it, because clearly you left them here. You don’t know how to clean other things, maybe you DONT know how to do it”. 

At this point it’s clear that she is belittling me, and I again tell her that if I forget to do something, she can always ask me nicely and it’s no problem. And then she blows up and starts full on yelling at me that she didn’t do anything wrong so it’s my fault that she’s yelling because I am being rude to her by asking her to talk to me nicely when she was already being nice. I told her not to yell at me and walked away. As I was walking away, she pointed out some clothes on the floor in the closet and said “see? Do you know how to pick these up?”

I really wanted to say “that’s not my responsibility!” About the bathroom hair, but thats not how I feel. I have no problem keeping things mostly in order as a shared responsibility, but she often doesn’t feel the same. She will make a mess in the kitchen at 8am and leave it all day. She won’t rinse a plate or bowl and put it in the dishwasher; she’ll just stack everything everywhere. 

I feel dumb even writing this out, as how can two people in a marriage even function if she talks to me like I’m a man child, but also expects me to help with her stuff but never wants to help with mine. At the end of the day, I’m upset that she talked to me like I’m dumb or incapable.

I had bad PPD and PPA and it eventually spiralled into full blown post partum psychosis. The relationship fracture stemmed from the fact that during this time I was trying to get well, my husband was trying desperately to hold the household together and her biggest concern appeared to be seeing her grandchild at whatever cost to my husband and I. We were told to ""suck it up and make it work"". When I was dealing with severe depression she told him that there ""was mental illness and there was bad behaviour"" and insinuated I was the latter. The day I finally lost it and called 911, my husband called her but asked her to wait outside while the police and paramedics tended to me (because of the insensitive comments she'd made prior). After this she confronted me about ""not being invited in"" and I was appalled that her main concern was manners when my family was experiencing one of the scariest days of our lives. She always expected apologies for things that she was offended by but refused to apologize for any of her behaviour. She would say certain things and I would say the same things back only to be called ""toxic"" or ""ugly"" (as in what I was saying was ugly).Things came to a head last summer when she asked me if we could go to a cottage for a week and I told her we couldn't take a week off work but we would be happy to join them for 2-3 nights. She said this ""sounded like bullshit"" and that it was disrespectful. Eventually she explained that she ""does not consider us all equal"" (even though we're adults) and that ""they are the parents and need to be treated as such"". I don't subscribe to that shit so MIL doesn't communicate much with me anymore which suits me fine.

When MIL was told we would stop for one night on the way down and one night on the way back all hell broke loose. It wasn't long enough, we're tearing apart the family, we don't care etc. 

It should be noted that while my MIL is a handful via text, in person she's actually pretty decent. Hugs me, talks to me etc. The only thing we don't like is that she continues to bring up topics she knows we don't want to discuss like gun control, government theories, trans people etc. and she brings these things up in front of our 5 year old child. She also makes passive aggressive comments to my husband. Visiting wouldn't be uncomfortable really, we're just fed up and tired of dealing with her.

We all went to see him and stayed at my grandmother’s house for a while. He had been on hospice after battling cancer for 18 months. His death is absolutely devastating, but not unexpected. 

I finally just got back home. I asked my mom if it would be okay to make a post about it now that it has been several hours, and most people he was close to had been notified. Not to mention I only have a handful of people who eveb knew my grandpa on my instagram. She told me that I could, so I wrote a small paragraph about how much I love him and put it on my story.

We set up some ground rules that we weren't allowed to leave the club, but everything other than that was fair game. On the way there we talked a lot about how she was gonna ask to buy a woman a drink, and how we were both down to make out with whoever we found at this club.

Before we arrive, she tells me that she is more nervous than she seems, and I do my best to reassure her. When we arrive, we dance together for a bit, and then a woman and I pair off together, let's call her Sally. Sally and I dance together basically the whole night, but I keep checking on my friend, and she keeps checking on hers. Every time I ask, my friend says that she's fine, and having a good time, etc, and I see her dancing with other people as well at times. Before I go anywhere with Sally at any point, I always made sure to let my friend know where we were going, and we never stayed anywhere other than the dancefloor for more than 5 minutes.

The night ends and it becomes clear that my friend is not happy, but she says she had a good time, but she was nervous this time, and will be more confident next time. I stay over at hers, and things seem more normal the next day.

When I get home, I start to feel bad because she was very clearly not alright once we left, and I start to feel like I ditched her, so I send a text apologising. She says thank you for the apology, but that she was pretty upset, and that she'll see me soon. I send her a text back, and say that I think there was a bit of a misunderstanding in our reasoning for going clubbing in the first place and that I'd see her when she was ready, but that I was also a bit upset because I'd asked a lot if she was ok, and having fun, offered her some of my drink etc, and she'd lied to me the whole time, expecting me to pick up on it (as I found out from a mutual friend later). It's been nearly a week, and she hasn't read my messages nor responded, and she's told two mutual friends that I ditched her while leaving out details like that we were both excited to meet new people etc.

She did send me a text that I didn't see until we left the club, but she deleted it before I could read what it said. I don't know why she wouldn't just ask me to check my texts the next time I went over to check in though.

The night ends and it becomes clear that my friend is not happy, but she says she had a good time, but she was nervous this time, and will be more confident next time. I stay over at hers, and things seem more normal the next day.

When I get home, I start to feel bad because she was very clearly not alright once we left, and I start to feel like I ditched her, so I send a text apologising. She says thank you for the apology, but that she was pretty upset, and that she'll see me soon. I send her a text back, and say that I think there was a bit of a misunderstanding in our reasoning for going clubbing in the first place and that I'd see her when she was ready, but that I was also a bit upset because I'd asked a lot if she was ok, and having fun, offered her some of my drink etc, and she'd lied to me the whole time, expecting me to pick up on it (as I found out from a mutual friend later). It's been nearly a week, and she hasn't read my messages nor responded, and she's told two mutual friends that I ditched her while leaving out details like that we were both excited to meet new people etc.

She did send me a text that I didn't see until we left the club, but she deleted it before I could read what it said. I don't know why she wouldn't just ask me to check my texts the next time I went over to check in though.

15,1f5xb10,AITA for calling out my brother-in-law in front of the entire family for telling my sister to shut up at the dinner table only to get thrown out of the house by my sister?,"My sister ""Ann"" (32 F) has been with her partner ""Nigel"" (31 M) for about a decade. I've noticed abusive behavior from him for as long as I can remember, both at work and at home. For example, one day, Ann suggested taking the dogs on a walk earlier due to the heat. Nigel's reaction was, ""That's the shittiest idea I've ever heard,"" causing Ann to tear up and leave. He also constantly talks over her and shuts her down. Ann gets defensive and angry if anyone brings up his behavior, and my parents have always put Nigel on a pedestal, never holding him accountable. They expect my partner and me to go along with this.

My sister and I haven't had contact for three months, mainly due to how she treats me. But my parents urged my partner and me to come over for a family dinner, and I foolishly agreed.

At dinner, we were discussing car rentals because I’m looking to rent a car. Ann suggested I buy a used car.

Ann: ""I think you should just put a down payment on a car because...""

Nigel: ""\[My sister's name\], calm down. Stop talking, just shut up, okay? Just shut up about it.""

Ann looked like a cowering child and immediately went silent.

That was the breaking point for me.

Me: ""Why did you tell her to shut up? She was talking, why'd you do that?""

Nigel: \[Something incoherent\]

Me, louder and upset: ""Don't talk to her like that.""

Nigel: ""Haha, I can 'cause I'm a man.""

I couldn't believe it. He made a misogynistic joke in response to being held accountable. My parents told me to stop my ""rude"" behavior. That was it for me.

Me to my partner: ""That's it, we're leaving.""

We went to pack our stuff. My mom came in and asked why I did that. I told her it's because he told her to shut up in front of her own family. How could anyone expect me not to intervene? Ann came in and told everyone to leave except me.

Ann: ""His and my relationship is none of your business. Stay out of it. This is my house, and it's my rules.""

Me: ""You expect me to let him talk to you like that right in front of me?""

Ann: ""You weren't there when I needed you the most, so you don't get to say anything.""

Me: ""I can't talk to you when you’re constantly lashing out. It affects my mental health, and I couldn’t take it.""

Ann: ""Then get out of my house, get the fck out.""

Me: ""Trust me, I don't want to be here as much as you don’t want me here. I’m out, fck this.""

My partner and I left. My parents followed me outside, which was the most painful part because my father defended Nigel, saying he was just trying to prevent a fight because Ann's tone was ""offensive."" But even if it were, it's extremely disrespectful for him to tell her to shut up, especially in front of her own family. My partner fully agrees with me and supports me.

18,1f5w2to,AITA for calling out my family for keeping the truth from me for years?,"In March I (17m) learned that my mom isn't my bio mom but is my stepmom and that my brother and sister are my stepsiblings. I was only 1 when my parents got married so I don't remember a time before and my biological mom doesn't want to know me which means I never grew up with two moms or anything. I always assumed I was their bio kid. They basically said I was. I thought my siblings were blood siblings too. I knew they didn't call dad 'dad' so I figured half siblings. But still siblings.

Which is why growing up I was so confused about why they hated me. They would get so mad at me for talking to them or breathing near them. They used to fight to not sit next to me at dinner and fight over who'd sit next to me in the car. They'd say I wasn't their brother but never answered why. Only answer I'd get was I was pathetic and I was gross. They would kick me out of the TV and game room because I wasn't allowed in there if they wanted to do something. I was so confused. I looked up to them and so badly wanted them to be like older siblings my friends had or like my friends were with younger siblings. I cried about it. I asked my parents why. I asked grandparents and extended family why. Nobody ever told me the truth. I also never got why they hated dad so much. Though they never seemed to hate him as much as me.

It did a number on younger me. I still have some hang ups from wanting my ""siblings"" to love me and being rejected every time and being treated like they would catch something from sitting next to me.

I started to question stuff when I needed my birth certificate and my parents wanted to bring it to school for me. So I searched it out and found it and saw dad's name but not mom's on there. I asked my parents. They admitted I was my mom's stepson and my siblings stepbrother. And they hadn't liked that and hadn't liked my dad. They said they had wanted me to love them so it would soften their hearts and let them accept me as a brother.

My family didn't like me saying my parents had lied and being mad about it. They think I'm being unfair. They mentioned it a few times.

She was showing up twice a day without asking just telling. She was demanding pictures everyday and wanted updates on how she slept every morning. She wanted updates after every doctor’s appointment. If I didn’t answer her texts then I would get a follow up call. It felt like I was the babysitter and she was a frantic mother who needed updates and pictures all the time.

Usually I have my husband address my concerns for me but I decided I was going to stick up for my self and be assertive when she texted me for what seemed like the hundredth time telling me that she is coming over this week but needed to know which day. So I texted her and said this:

Wednesday after my husband gets home from work should be fine. Most weeks will work but some are busier than others so in the future can you ask if you can come over not just when. 

She responded with: Your always welcome at my house 

Then she texted my husband and I in a group message with: I will not be coming over this week

I didn’t respond to either because I felt like the messages were passive aggressive. Then my husband ripped me a new asshole and told me that I was rude to his mom. 

A couple days later we all sat down to talk it out and my father in law told me that it was rude and that I have to recognize that they have good intentions and I told them that I’m frustrated because I feel like I can’t tell them when things bother me because they are passive aggressive when I do and they told me that they are never passive aggressive. 

I told them that I want them to respect my parenting wishes and my mother in law scoffed and said she doesn’t do that and I proceeded to give her an example this last week when she did which was when she told my daughter that she doesn’t care if her parents don’t want her looking at screens and proceeded to give her a phone to watch a YouTube video.

That’s when she went totally bonkers and stood up and screamed “I’m leaving” and then stormed towards the door and yelled “I can’t even with you!” Then slammed the door and then came back in like 30 seconds later to scream at me some more and I was so shocked by her reaction that I don’t even remember what she said. 

My father in law then headed towards the door and told me I have to work on my social maturity.

I am so confused by this whole situation because I didn’t think my text was that bad. Sure it’s direct and probably wasn’t fun to hear but I thought it was respectful but their reactions have been so extreme that I am wondering if I did something wrong my sticking up for myself.

I didn’t respond to either because I felt like the messages were passive aggressive. Then my husband ripped me a new asshole and told me that I was rude to his mom. 

A couple days later we all sat down to talk it out and my father in law told me that it was rude and that I have to recognize that they have good intentions and I told them that I’m frustrated because I feel like I can’t tell them when things bother me because they are passive aggressive when I do and they told me that they are never passive aggressive. 

I told them that I want them to respect my parenting wishes and my mother in law scoffed and said she doesn’t do that and I proceeded to give her an example this last week when she did which was when she told my daughter that she doesn’t care if her parents don’t want her looking at screens and proceeded to give her a phone to watch a YouTube video.

That’s when she went totally bonkers and stood up and screamed “I’m leaving” and then stormed towards the door and yelled “I can’t even with you!” Then slammed the door and then came back in like 30 seconds later to scream at me some more and I was so shocked by her reaction that I don’t even remember what she said. 

My father in law then headed towards the door and told me I have to work on my social maturity.

I am so confused by this whole situation because I didn’t think my text was that bad. Sure it’s direct and probably wasn’t fun to hear but I thought it was respectful but their reactions have been so extreme that I am wondering if I did something wrong my sticking up for myself. Even my husband isn’t on my side so please let me know.

27,1f5u0l4,AITA for getting uncomfortable with my girlfriend’s new obsession? ,"My girlfriend (23) and I (28) have been together for 4 years. We’ve never had any trust or jealousy issues our whole duration of being together but lately I feel as if that’s starting to change because she’s grown an attachment to a fairly popular twitch streamer that I supposedly “introduced her to.” 

Now the issue isn’t her watching live streams or youtube videos. I do too and I also have a favorite twitch streamer. The issue is her obsession with the twitch streamer and him being the boyfriend of my favorite twitch streamer. 

Whenever I bring up how uncomfortable it makes me feel about her attachment she’s uses the argument of “it’s no different than your obsession with his girlfriend, and you ARE the reason why I know of him” which is completely false. I do not have an obsession with her and I am not the reason why she knows of her boyfriend. I agree in the beginning of our relationship I used to watch her a lot, and her boyfriend would pop up here and there (that might be what my girlfriend meant by introducing him to her) However, my girlfriend never expressed any discomfort and I’ve toned it down now, out of respect for her, which I feel she should do as well.

During my “obsession phase” as she like to call it, I wasn’t even taking it to the extreme she takes it now. I will admit at one point I did have a strong attraction to the twitch streamer and I still kind of do which is why I haven’t been watching her as much or around my girlfriend. But I never brought it to a point where the streamer was apart of my daily routine.

 She’s watched every single one of his past recorded streams, posted streams on youtube, his regular youtube videos, liked any post his made on his social media accounts, and even has notifications set anytime he posts anything. At least 3-4 nights in a week she’ll lay up next to me and watch his streams while just uncontrollably laughing at him and he’s not even funny. There was a time she bailed on me to go watch one of live streams and when I told her she could just watch it later when it’s reposted, she told me no, that it wouldn’t be the same as watching him live and I wouldn’t understand and if I really needed company that bad I could just go watch (twitch streamer name) “since she never fails at distracting you” whatever that means. 

I don’t feel that’s a fair argument for reasons I’ve already explained. Her actions have just become blatantly rude and disrespectful towards me. I mean does she have no regards for my emotions and how that would make me feel? Im a man, of course watching her get all giddy about another guy would make me feel a way. I just feel so disrespected and hurt.

It also really just makes me feel weird that she had to have a crush on the twitch streamer I really used to like boyfriend, like there aren’t thousands of others. If this wasn’t the case maybe I wouldn’t have such a problem with it.

Anyways, Am I the asshole? 





EDIT; An instance I forgot to the mention because I am in a rush.

She called me an asshole and hypocrite for complaining about her obsession because I used to do the same and she never had an issue with it. I told her it’s not the same and clearly don’t have to explain why. She clearly sees how much I dislike what she’s doing so she should have respect for me and take that as a sign to chill out a bit or just stop.

28,1f5t7ns,AITA for giving my family a reverse discount when they want art,"I sell art commissions, and my friends regularly commission me, often paying just $5 for their first piece as a discount. This mostly applies to in-person commissions with people I'm close to. They're generally okay with paying, and sometimes they even offer a little extra.

However, my parents and brother disapprove of me charging for art, especially when it's for people I know. They often say things like, ""They're your friends; they shouldn't have to pay you,"" or ""It doesn't take that long to draw something."" My brother has even told me, ""Your art isn't worth anything."" They use examples of me drawing free art for birthdays, holidays, and other occasions as proof that I don't need to charge for my work. They also point to instances where I've drawn for friends or family out of my own desire or for young relatives who can't afford to pay, saying this means I shouldn’t charge anyone.

After hearing these comments, I started offering my art for free, partly to avoid conflict and partly because I began to doubt myself. Technically, my work doesn't take that long—about 10 hours on average over 2-5 days. I've done free work before, like creating logos for the library and posters for school clubs, and while I didn't always expect payment, it would have been nice.

On their side, my family argues that art should be something you do out of passion, not for profit, especially when it involves people you care about. They believe that because I'm close to these people, I should be happy to create something for them without expecting anything in return. They also think that by charging, I'm potentially damaging relationships, making them feel like they're being treated as clients rather than loved ones.

The problem escalated when they started asking for more complex, full-shaded pieces, which take longer—up to 40 hours over two weeks. Some even asked me to redo entire pieces or remove my watermark because ""it doesn't look good."" They rarely credited me for my work, and when I asked, they dismissed it as unimportant.

After some reflection, I decided I was done with giving away free art to people who didn’t appreciate it. I increased my prices for those who had complained about paying, adding a 25% surcharge. For example, a headshot sketch that was $8 became $10, and a full-body, fully shaded piece went from $45 to $56.25. These family members quickly noticed the price increase and were offended when I told them they had to pay or get nothing. They argued that if they had to pay more, so should my friends. But I kept the original prices for those who hadn’t complained.

My brother called me a greedy bitch, and honestly I couldn't give two craps what HE thinks, but it still hurts. But I’ve stuck to my decision and refused to draw for those who’ve treated me poorly, though it has affected my motivation.

30,1f5t00w,"AITA For Wanting the Hans Zimmer ticket I paid for despite a breakup?
","Hey Folks, 

  
A few months ago the girl (Monica, for this story)  who I had a situationship with found that Hans Zimmer was coming to our city. I said I was down, and she got us tickets. I paid her back. We both knew our long term future was uncertain, but decided to get the tickets anyways. 

In  mid June, our relationship broke down but we both agreed we'd see each other at the concert as its a passion of both of us. A friend of hers (Coach, for this story) had tried to convince her to sell my ticket to her so that she could go instead, but Monica said no cause it was not right. I even thanked her for having stood up to do that. 

A few weeks after, we exchanged words that were hurtful to both of us as we were not able to see eye to eye on events that happened in our relationship. Earlier this week, after a bit of radio silence she messages and says she needs some of the stuff I have of hers urgently. I had plans all of this week, but since she really needed her stuff for the weekend I told her to not worry, ""I'll make it work"" and cancelled my plans to meet her. 

When we meet, I get her a few things from Costco that I always used to get her for old times sake (basic food that she has had to sometimes ration due to cost savings...I don't like seeing ppl go hungry) and to show there's no hard feelings. She does not bother thanking me for anything, and says that she didn't care that I cancelled my plans just to meet up with her. As I'm talking to her, she's got an earbud in with Coach on the line listening into our convo and likely coaching her what to say. 

Monica then proceeds to tell me that she's going to take my Hans ticket. She will give me the money I paid for it, but that if I want to go I'll need to buy another one.  The ticket prices have shot up from \~200 we paid to \~600 so well out of my budget. I tell her this is not fair, and I want my ticket that I paid for. Or she can pay me current market value (ie \~600) - but taking something I paid for and giving it to someone else is outright theft. No idea if Coach is going or she's going with another guy, and it probably does not matter. The concert is in 2 weeks so this is also very last minute notice to tell me I'm not going to something I've looked forward to for months. 

I'm super hurt cause in the few months I knew her I paid for everything we did together - and some things were very expensive. Even for Hans, when we were getting tickets I offered to pay for hers as well so that she would not be as financially stressed (she declined) - even though I was not doing great from a financial point of view either.

I even thanked her for having stood up to do that. 

A few weeks after, we exchanged words that were hurtful to both of us as we were not able to see eye to eye on events that happened in our relationship. Earlier this week, after a bit of radio silence she messages and says she needs some of the stuff I have of hers urgently. I had plans all of this week, but since she really needed her stuff for the weekend I told her to not worry, ""I'll make it work"" and cancelled my plans to meet her. 

When we meet, I get her a few things from Costco that I always used to get her for old times sake (basic food that she has had to sometimes ration due to cost savings...I don't like seeing ppl go hungry) and to show there's no hard feelings. She does not bother thanking me for anything, and says that she didn't care that I cancelled my plans just to meet up with her. As I'm talking to her, she's got an earbud in with Coach on the line listening into our convo and likely coaching her what to say. 

Monica then proceeds to tell me that she's going to take my Hans ticket. She will give me the money I paid for it, but that if I want to go I'll need to buy another one.  The ticket prices have shot up from \~200 we paid to \~600 so well out of my budget. I tell her this is not fair, and I want my ticket that I paid for. Or she can pay me current market value (ie \~600) - but taking something I paid for and giving it to someone else is outright theft. No idea if Coach is going or she's going with another guy, and it probably does not matter. The concert is in 2 weeks so this is also very last minute notice to tell me I'm not going to something I've looked forward to for months. 

I'm super hurt cause in the few months I knew her I paid for everything we did together - and some things were very expensive. Even for Hans, when we were getting tickets I offered to pay for hers as well so that she would not be as financially stressed (she declined) - even though I was not doing great from a financial point of view either. 

  
TLDR; AITA for wanting the concert ticket I paid for (or current market value) despite a breakup?

31,1f5szgw,AITA for visiting my brother's best friend in the hospital?,"My (23F) brother (25M) has a best friend Nate (25M) who I've known my whole life. Tbh, we've never been close despite growing up together and I used to actually sort of hate him so I didn't expect to feel so bad and worried when my brother told us Nate had been in an accident and was in the hospital. My family see him like a member of the family so my parents and older sister all rushed to go see Nate but I didn't go originally since I thought it would be weird but I couldn't shake the bad feeling so I eventually went to see him on my own.

It's probably a weird way to describe it but I had fun?? visiting him. It was probably the nicest interaction we've had since I've know him since usually he either ignores me or is a bit of a dick to me. 

Mid way through the visit my brother and some of their other friends turned up. I don't know what his problem was but immediately my brother was annoyed that I was there. He even later on said that it was 'weird' that I'd gone to see Nate. There's a limit of how many visitors can be there so my brother told me to go home but I wasn't ready to leave yet so Nate told all of his friends, including my brother, to wait outside. I stayed for another 30/40 minutes I would say and by that point Nate's family had come back so I left since it definitely would've been weird for them to wait outside because of me.

Ever since my brother has been pissy af with me because I went to see Nate and made them wait outside. I probably should've left when they arrived but even Nate seemed to be having fun which is why I didn't.

32,1f5sosc,AITA for not planning a retirement party?,"Last December, a co-worker and a friend “Julie” retired. We worked on the same team for years and were close. Julie also was very generous with my family. I still consider her a friend. 

About six weeks before Julie's retirement, my boss asked me to take the reins and plan an in-office retirement party for her. This involved organizing food (it was a potluck), collecting money and buying a gift, getting a cake, making sure the heads of the company were there, etc.  The reality was neither he nor his boss wanted to deal with it and foisting it off on me under the guise of me being her good friend just got them out of the responsibility gracefully. Fine, no problem. I did it FOR JULIE, not to help out my bosses. I wanted to be sure she had a great retirement party that made her happy. 

I asked a co-worker for some assistance on decorations and handled the rest myself. It wasn't difficult, but it was time consuming, and I had to devote a good amount of time to it outside my working hours (I am just a PT employee and paid accordingly). I am not a natural “party planner” and don't particularly enjoy hosting, but I did this happily FOR JULIE. We had the party, it went perfectly and Julie was thrilled. Fantastic.

Well, fast-forward to now. We have two other people in my location who will be retiring the end of next month. I know them, have worked with them in the past, but am not close to them. Last week, my boss “Chris” calls me in and says, “Hey Vivienne, you did such a great job planning Julie's retirement party, Jim (my boss' boss) and I want you to handle George and Robert's retirement party.” I looked at Chris with a puzzled face and said, “Why? I'm not close with them and I'm not on their team. I think it would be more appropriate and make more sense to have someone on their team or one of the admins handle it.”  

Chris continued, “Well, you did such a great job with Julie's party that you set the bar high. I'm sure George and Robert would be thrilled to have a party like that.” “Chris,” I said, “Julie was and is my friend. I put all that time and effort into that party FOR HER because she has been so kind to me and my family over the years. I put in a lot of time outside my working hours for that party. I'm not close with George or Robert and, speaking frankly, have zero interest in planning a party for either of them. HR or their team manager can figure it out. I'll have to decline.” Chris got a bit huffy and said, “Well, I guess I can't force you to do it, but Jim will be disappointed as it reflects poorly on our team.” I said, “Well, it also reflects poorly on George and Robert's teams that they're not taking the lead handling their own employees' retirement parties” and walked out of Chris' office. It hasn't been discussed since, so I'm assuming some other arrangement was put in place.

34,1f5sdxi,AITA for leaving the shared stay mid-vacation with friends and move to a more comfortable stay nearby ,"So we(30M and 29F) are on vacation for 3 days with our friends (35M 35F and her mom 65F). The plan was to explore a city in US as well as do a hike and visit a few wineries. So pretty much be outside the house/accommodation. It was due to the reason we decided to go for cheaper accommodation and spend more on the experiences

During the initial bookings we had some disagreements where we couldn’t agree on the airbnb because all of my suggestions were shot down for being too expensive so we decided to leave the decision of the stay to our friends and we focused more on the things we wanted to do 

The stay they decided was supposed to be 3 bedrooms, but everyone missed that 1 of the bedroom is 200ft away from the main property and does not have a restroom making it essentially useless for us. It was everyone mistake as it was mentioned in the description of the listing and they had shared the listing with us before booking the stay. (i feel I was exhausted with all the back and forth regarding the decision so was just happy at that time that it looked reasonable and didn’t go through the details)

Now the accommodation has turned into we both our in 1 bedroom and the three of them are sharing a twin bed in other bedroom . All of us are uncomfortable as the beds are not good at all( also pointed out in reviews)

It is day 1 and everyone could get hardly 3 hours of sleep and we still have 2 more days remaining.

My suggestion is we book 1 room in a motel 10 mins away and only during night time we both go and sleep in the motel, this way they will also be able to utilize both the rooms to their comfort. I will pay for the entire room we will book and continue to honor the split of initial airbnb rent we had plan.

My wife thinks they will find it extremely rude that we decided to stay away when we our on a shared trip and think we should just soldier through the trip and take it more like a learning for the next trip. She also feel me paying for the airbnb when we are not staying there can be taken as rude and showing off given the context of initial back n forth. 
We are in slight disagreement over this, both of us agree it would be more comfortable for everyone if we stay away but don’t want to hurt our friends feelings and our friendship since we both love these guys.

35,1f5saty,AITA (28F) for getting really frustrated with my 28M boyfriend because he says he does not need to share everything to me?,"
I, a 28F, became really frustrated with my partner,28M, last night.

When I asked who it was, he said it was a friend and that she was asking him about some grammar questions since she is starting to learn English. I shrugged it off. Dinner came and I suddenly remembered what had happened earlier. I asked who it was and he said it was a friend. I asked if he could tell me a name and he said he didn't have to tell me everything, even if we were married. I interpreted it as him hiding something from me, so I answered, ""Clearly you are hiding something!"" For me, it's easy to just answer the question or maybe I am overthinking it. I stormed out of the kitchen all while he is saying I was making a big deal out of the situation. He followed me to the bedroom and he asked if I really wanted her name, he would tell me. I snapped. I said I didn't need to know who she is anymore because his actions alone gave me the answer I needed. I said it in a very loud manner. I am afraid I spoke too aggressively. He said he would have told me anyway if I hadn't been so passive aggressive and accused him of things. He even said I attacked him with the question which rubbed him the wrong way. At that point I was so confused as to what had happened.  I may have really let out an accusatory tone. I honestly don't know. Now I feel really bad. I am sitting on the staircase thinking about how I reacted. I may have overreacted. I am very confused.

I dont have my license yet but i will soon so my boyfriend drives the car when we go out.

The country we live in is quite reckless with driving since its in the middle east the laws arent followed and punished when broken so most people drive how they feel like. Of course my boyfriend being raised in this environment somewhat adapted those habits. He knows not to drive my dads car like that but sometimes he slips up and drives really recklessly. Not indicating when moving, going over the speed limit, not driving the way someone in the west would. 

I teach him how to properly drive since my dads taught me the proper safe way to. Because here the whole exam is driving around and then one reverse parking. Thats it. So i dont blame most people for how they drive especially when they arent taught but i tell him how to drive my car. 

Earlier he went around a bend at 60 mph. Way too fast and almost smashed into the back of someones car because they break checked. Because the car is front also was going too fast until he saw traffic right around the corner. Keep in mind this road is probably a 30-40 mph road. I got so mad at him. Because im sick of having to tell him how to drive safely, but we continued on to go to the mall to get the things i needed, i barely spoke because i was so angry. Then our friend group called and asked if we where at the mall and he said yes, they asked to come he said yes without asking me. I didnt want to see anyone but he had already said yes. They come we talk for a bit etc.

My boyfriend notices im still upset cause ive barely had alone time to get over what he did and hes now mad at me for leaving the hangout without saying anything to his face even tho i sent a message saying im leaving after arguing on text for 20 minutes next to our friends.

He just kept saying “oh the guy in front of me break checked, oh i usually go that speed on that road you never say anything”, ive never noticed before because obviously im not the one driving i dont see the speed.

Mostly, we split recurring expenses 50/50, but I've wanted to ask him to see if we can go into more of a 60/40 or 63/35 split. Luckily, no mortgage since he owns the house we live in. He makes a bit less than i do, but after loans, and our current 50/50, he has more leftover money than I do. 

when I brought it up, he just said no (he didn't even listen to what i wanted to say) and it's been something that we've been arguing about for a bit.

40,1f5rddq,AITA for not „being there“ for my friend?,"I (17f) have a friend (18f) who has been in a relationship with her boyfriend (17m) for two years.

For the past year and a half, she's been constantly arguing with him. One time, she was staying over at our place, and in the middle of the night, around 3 am, she left to go to his place to resolve a fight.

Recently, her arguments with him have become even more frequent. She calls me in the middle of the night almost every week, and we end up on the phone for over four hours, always discussing the same issues. 

Her boyfriend has done some truly awful things to her. Things I don't even want to repeat here. Despite this, she never follows my advice and continues to go back to him, only to be disappointed when he doesn't meet her expectations.

Yesterday, I reached my breaking point. I called her and told her that she shouldn't expect me to console her anymore if she's just going to ignore my advice and keep coming back with the same problems. 

I explained that while I will always be there for her, I can't keep trying to solve problems she's not willing to walk away from. When I told her this, she got really angry and screamed at me, saying that l'm not a good friend.

Am I wrong for setting this boundary?

41,1f5qs8d,AITA for not “communicating” with my (F29) spouse (M37)?,"I want to start from the beginning with my husband. We’ve known each other for over 9 years, married for 6. When I first fell in love with him, I was just coming out of an abusive relationship with my ex who lied and cheated. My husband was a breath of fresh air, sweet, and gentle with me. He promised many things. I used to tell him everything from my day to talking about theories about the workings of the universe  to keep my mind moving (I’m a big learner and love discussing things like this).
It all changed when we made a trip to move up north for a job opportunity. I agreed to move with him because I love traveling and meeting new people and exploring new places. When we arrived the first thing I noticed was that we were staying in a mobile home. It was run down and needed work. We spent the first few months with me working part time in retail while he tried to land a job. A month later, I found out I was pregnant with my daughter. I was scared, had no family to support me as they were 13 hours south. He finally got a job seven months after we moved up here. I also managed the cleaning and was going to appointments for ultrasounds and a part time job. He didn’t always go to the appointments with me.
After my daughter was born, I tore and couldn’t do much for the first few weeks. He complained about how the house was a wreck and how I couldn’t “get up and do a load of damn laundry since [I] was home all day.” I started crying right there while holding my daughter. I managed her day and night schedule so he could work and sleep. Then I went back to work and was relieved to get out of the house. I didn’t want to talk to my husband because when I asked him to do something, he would reply he’d get to it and never did. At one point I asked him to take the trash out twice and he told me to “quit my bitching and he’d get to it.” I stopped asking for help. Three years later. I threatened divorce if he didn’t shape up and get his medical issues under control and went to therapy. He promised me he’d go and went for three months then stopped. A year later I did the same thing again, but I was tired. I was tired of doing all the work at home and working a full time job. I had been doing it on my own for six years at this point. The house was in shambles, nothing was getting done. I had slipped into depression and my doctor was deeply concerned and put me in therapy and crisis counseling. He finally snapped to it and started taking care of himself. Now he complains about lack of communication and the fact the house is a mess. When he does clean he expects to be applauded for his work while I struggle to get out of bed everyday and do something with my life. I’m so tired. I miss home with my parents. Am I the asshole for wanting to leave after he finally made a change?

43,1f5qn43,AITA for threatening to report a shady landlord?,"I moved into a place a few months back for the summer and signed a contract with a certain person A with him specified as the owner. Where I'm from it's not very common to have a full-on official registration of the contract for short-term stays, or do deep due diligence with document inspection, because the society is high-trust and low-crime.

When I was moving in, it turned out that he had not registered me with the building security, and moreover, the security doesn't even know him. Person B then appeared and said that person A is actually a subtenant who leases the place from person B, the tenant, who in turn leases it from an unknown owner C. I expressed frustration there and then, with security present, and asked whom should I communicate with moving forward, to which the person B replied: with me.

Under the contract, Person A asked for an unreasonably hefty deposit, acknowledged later by person B, which I transferred nonetheless. Come end of rental period, person A (the subtenant whom I signed with) has hardly spoken to me, most of communication was with person B (the tenant). Person A suddenly appears and starts making my life harder: for example, telling me to move out early in the day, even though the place is completely free afterwards, and we had agreed on a later time with person B. Again, I have no idea who person A is, I never met them, they never provided any documents to me, we only spoke on messengers. I transferred them the full payment and deposit based on the contract they signed as an owner. All this time, person B is listed in all official documents, access cards etc as the legitimate tenant. I was also a good... sub-sub-tenant and even fixed some things in the apartment, bought a new shower head.

As a culmination, on day of departure I ask person B to come check the apartment. He agrees and notifies person A that everything is fine, and my deposit should be returned. Person A, offended that I refuse to communicate with them, ignores the request and says they will only do it if I will ask them directly, and that checking the place will take a few days. Person B sent me a screenshot of their angry and dismissive message, and I replied with the following:

""Thanks, no urgency on my end as long as you confirmed that the apartment is fine. I can only communicate with you on this for the reasons outlined above. It seems we’re in a deadlock here: someone posing as an owner and signing the contract as an owner receives money from me by bank transfer, then it turns out they’re not even a tenant, the security doesn’t know them, and all access cards are under your name. I have no idea who that person is, and why they took my money in the first place. I also have no idea why I must ask them to send it back if the apartment is fine… they have my details.

46,1f5piwl,AITA for looking for my friend instead of FaceTime with my boyfriend? ,"So…. Last week my (26F) good friend’s (31M) son died in a car accident. Let’s call my friend Jay. Jay has been my really good friend for few years, never anything beyond platonic, but he knows my siblings, my mother and had friendships with them now too. Before we met, he also had a daughter who passed away from Leukemia at a very young age. He’s experienced so much loss in life. 

Now, my boyfriend (38M) I’ve been with for about a year and a half, let’s call him Cal, was working last night, and was scheduled to work until 6:30am. I truly love this guy and would never do anything intentionally to hurt him.  

I was planning on just going to bed last night, and was in bed until I got a text from Jay. It was a little alarming and at the same time pretty vague. His son died literally one week ago, so I panicked. I immediately got in my car and drove to his house, checked all of his regular hangouts to see if I could find him and make sure he was safe. I may have overreacted because I can’t imagine going through something like that and I know I would have spiraled so hard. 

Now, before I left to go look for Jay, Cal had called me on FaceTime. I didn’t answer, I was stressing, and honestly didn’t even hear my phone ring.

So Reddit, am I the asshole? ",Not the A-hole,2024-08-31,"AITA for looking for my friend instead of FaceTime with my boyfriend?  So…. Last week my (26F) good friend’s (31M) son died in a car accident. Let’s call my friend Jay. Jay has been my really good friend for few years, never anything beyond platonic, but he knows my siblings, my mother and had friendships with them now too. Before we met, he also had a daughter who passed away from Leukemia at a very young age. He’s experienced so much loss in life. 

Now, my boyfriend (38M) I’ve been with for about a year and a half, let’s call him Cal, was working last night, and was scheduled to work until 6:30am. I truly love this guy and would never do anything intentionally to hurt him.  

I was planning on just going to bed last night, and was in bed until I got a text from Jay. It was a little alarming and at the same time pretty vague. His son died literally one week ago, so I panicked. I immediately got in my car and drove to his house, checked all of his regular hangouts to see if I could find him and make sure he was safe. I may have overreacted because I can’t imagine going through something like that and I know I would have spiraled so hard. 

Now, before I left to go look for Jay, Cal had called me on FaceTime. I didn’t answer, I was stressing, and honestly didn’t even hear my phone ring. While I was out driving he called again and I did answer this time. He told me he got off work early, was at a bar and wanted me to go line dancing with him.

47,1f5ph6c,AITA for not learning Spanish?,"My (15m) dad Jim is in a relationship with Clara, who has three sons (6m, 13m & 15m). We moved in together last year.
Clara is originally from a Spanish-speaking country, and her two older sons were born there too. They moved to this country about 8 years ago, so her youngest son was born here.
My dad speaks fluent Spanish for work. Clara & her sons speak Spanish as their first language, with English as their second. I do not speak Spanish at all.
Clara's sons speak Spanish to each other at home, but switch to English if they specifically want to talk to me. Clara will sometimes try to get them to speak English so I can understand everything they're talking about, but they push back against this as they prefer talking in Spanish. Clara will forget herself and talk in Spanish, even addressing me before realising what she's doing.
I don't mind this. I really don't care what they're talking about even if I'm in the room so I will tune them out to use my phone/study/whatever. If they want to talk to me, they can speak English.
My dad and Clara really want me to learn Spanish though. They've tried to get me to study it at school but I chose another language. Then they said that I could study it outside school, but that's a lot of time and effort I'd rather use on other stuff. Clara has said she can teach me casually, and will occasionally try to get me to repeat words or phrases in Spanish, like if I ask her to pass the salt or something, which I find annoying and don't engage. This has got worse lately as some of Clara's family visited a few weeks ago and don't speak English at all, so I didn't really engage with them either. 
I get that Clara and her sons prefer to talk in Spanish at home as they have to speak in English at work & school, but I don't want to waste a lot of time learning a language just for their benefit. Plus if my dad & Clara break up in the future, it's even more of a waste.

After we finished shopping, i took her to a cafe and she asked me what the nail polish does/ how to use it. I explained it to her and she got really excited and asked me to paint her nails. 
When i dropped her at her house after, i went in to say hi to my stepmum and my sister showed her her nails.

51,1f5nue9,AITA I abandoned my friend on the London Underground,"I'm 25m, he's early 20s and has pretty much no experience with budgetting. Last time I was on holiday with him he spent all his money then said he'd need to borrow money to get the underground, 

Now, I'm not really comfortable with asking for money, and, well, he's not exactly one for paying a debt if he's not chased up on it, so he never repaid.

This time, he was spending money at an alarming rate and said he might need to borrow money for the unerground. I suggested, ""Why don't you put £10 in your suitcase and leave it there until it's time to go? That'll more than cover the underground."" The underground isn't that expensive.

Good idea right? He didn't seem to think so as he spent it all. 

Time to go home came, he asked if he could borrow money from the underground. I said he couldn't, he never paid back last time. He said he would. I told him he should still pay me back for last time, but I'm not lending this time. I then told him to do whatever he'd do if I wasn't there, or if I'd been as reckless as he had been with his money, scanned my card, went through the barrier and went home, him still on the other side of the barrier.

His answer seemed to be to call home, we're about 3 hours away from London so his brother ended up doing a 6 hour round trip(not including the London traffic) to get him.

We were not asked if we were available that date before they made the plans.  When they told us the date, we told them we had plans, but that we would attempt to change them.  Our plans were for dinner with 6 friends who we were going to be traveling with on a vacation 2 weeks later.  We were the ones that had made all of the preliminary plans for a house rental, car rental, dinner reservations and so on.  The dinner was scheduled for at our home with plans to go through schedules, activities and everything else involved in the trip.  Since we had made all of the preliminary plans, it was essential that we be at the dinner.  Once we were aware of the conflict, we tried to change the date, but there were literally no other dates prior to our vacation departure that the 4 couples could all make it.  

Had we been made aware of the date when they were making the plans, the date would have been available and we would have committed to the birthday party.  We had booked our plans with friends a couple weeks prior to being told about the birthday plans.

They planned the birthday for a Saturday and a baptism for granddaughter #3 on Sunday.  We told our son and DIL that we would leave at 4:00am on Sunday to get to the baptism in time on Sunday morning and then stay the rest of the day and evening to celebrate granddaughter #2's birthday.

On Saturday we sent a text to our son reconfirming the time and location of the baptism and our plans for the stay, even though they were aware for the past couple of weeks of our plans.  We received a message back telling us ""do not come tomorrow"".

Since that time they have skipped their twice a week portal calls where we talk to the grandkids and read them some books.  They also refused to let us talk to granddaughter #2 on her actual birthday.

We have always made it a point to drop everything to visit the kids and grandkids.  We are 4+ hours away and think of nothing to drive down early and return home that night.  On one occasion we drove the 4+ hours each way, to watch a 20-minute dance recital.  

We really wanted to be at her party, but the other plans were made first and were not able to be changed.  We were not asked in advance if the date worked for us, but DIL parents were, son and DIL friends were and priest was.

We can understand the son and DIL being disappointed that we couldn't make it, but behaving as they are and using their kids against us, especially since we very very rarely ever miss anything, seems completely inappropriate.

Now Jack was venting to me about how he and his wife couldn't get Ed to read. I thought about it for a while. The kid likes spy movies. Watched each of the Missipn Impossible films more times than we can count.

So I bought him a novel about a 12 yo being recruited by the CIA and trained at a spy academy for talented kids. It got his interest and he is reading the book right now.

But Jack said I shouldn't have gotten him something with such a 'ludicrous, far-fetched plot.' I told him it's entertaining because of the ludicrous plot and you need the kid to enjoy reading first before he'll start reading more serious stuff.

Jack thinks 'reading silly books is pointless' so I told him that that sounds like something his dad would say. He immediately bristled at that and said I shouldn't compare him to the man since I know how complicated their relationship is(Jack's dad is a doctor who constantly pressured him to read only science books and spent years trying to get him to want to go to medical school.

57,1f5kf1s,AITA for asking my partner to help with household chores at my place even though he also has his own apartment?,"I (42f) have been together with my partner (36m) for over a year and the relationship has been pretty drama-free so far.

For the past six months he has been spending roughly 6 out of 7 days at my place with me and my kiddo (6m) from a previous relationship. We mostly hang out here because I have to be there for the kiddo and because he has roommates, and I don't. To be clear, I love having him around.

A few months after he started spending so much time here, I asked him to start helping with the household chores, though only ones which he contributes to (cleaning and garbage) or from which he benefits (laundry and cooking and use of my car). I do the great majority of all work associated with my son, as well as the majority overall in the household (really, I only ask that he does the garbage, helps with the car since he uses it, and helps with occasional deep cleaning). He agreed initially but asked me to ask him directly to do these things, which I do, I've even started making lists. However, he often forgets or puts them off for so long that I end up doing them myself. His argument for not doing chores is that he also has to maintain his apartment and also is making a sacrifice by not being at his place where he can pursue his hobbies. So, his contribution, in effect, is that he is here.

Just to be clear, we both work full time (wfh), split mutual costs evenly, money is not the issue.

Things blew up yesterday after I had a hard day at work and with the kiddo. He is in the process of changing jobs and doesn't have much to do at work, so he has been gaming 6-8 hours a day this week. I found it really frustrating that I was struggling to get the laundry and cooking done in between juggling the kid and work and he was gaming on the couch all day. He got angry when I brought it up (I could have been a little less snarky…) and said that I don't acknowledge the sacrifice he is making by being at my place and that the benefit he gets from my work is negligible since I would have to do laundry and cook for myself and my son even if he wasn't here.

Since the problems we are having are roommate problems and not romantic partner problems, I suggested we go back to dating so that we can each have our own space and he can pursue his hobbies at his place.

58,1f5jn0v,AITA for letting my ex wife watch my kids? ,"I (30 m) was married to my ex wife for three years. We got married at 18. We had two kids together. We got divorced. She moved on and got married and had another child with her now husband. I did the same, but later, with my late wife. She and I also had two kids together. So my ex wife has primary custody of our two kids that we have together, so they are with her I think it's 85% of the time. I get them 8 days a month. She is a stay at home mom, which is their business. My kids seem to never need anything they don't have so it's not my concern. But recently my wife passed away, and as she had decided to be a SAHM even though we couldn't really afford it, now there's no one to watch the two kids we have together. My ex offered to watch one of my boys while I took the other to the doctor one day because I called her to let her know since what he had was contagious. So I accepted the offer. She then after I got back with my sick son offered to watch them until I could find someone more permanent. Also, she offered to do this for free. It's been four months since the boys have been staying with her during the day and they have a great time and enjoy spending extra time with their brother and sister and my ex's son with her husband. My late wife's family kind of distanced themselves when she passed, which I can understand, but they recently reached back out and her mom wants to keep the boys while I work and I told her I have childcare taken care of. Needless to say when she found out my ex wife was the childcare she and everyone else hit the roof. They said I'm disrespecting my wife's memory by handing her children off to another woman to raise and also called my ex a lot of things I'm not gonna list here. 

They apparently think she's doing this to get back together with me and ""take over"" my kids with my wife. I don't think so, at all.... she's married. But am I being disrespectful? It's getting in my head now. I don't in any way want to disrespect my sweet wife's memory. 

The two of them got along really well. My wife always said my ex was a great mom any time she was brought up.

59,1f5jm0p,WIBTA for not letting my housemate's boyfriend live with us?,"So I (29M) am sharing a house with two flatmates. Let's call them Lucy and Annie. Lucy has been here from the start, Annie and I are quite new here.

Now Lucy is in a long-distance relationship with her BF of 2 years. He's from India, but currently lives in another country which is closer to where we are. His visa is expiring, so they're going to get married in November (which Lucy didn't tell us).

Here it gets tricky. They want to move in together, so Lucy asked us if it would be fine if he moved into her room in 6 weeks. Annie doesn't really have an opinion on it and she's too stressed right now to think about it, and I'm against it tbh. I really don't like being around lovey-dovey couples, it makes me extremely uncomfortable, and I'd like to be in peace while at home. All my friends recommended me to not do it since living with couples is apparantly a crappy situation to be in. So tomorrow we'll have a meeting to discuss how to go on.

But it gets trickier. Lucy said that if we didn't accept her boyfriend moving in, she'd probably move out and find something else for them. But she owns 90% of the stuff in this house, so Annie and I would have to redecorate. I'd be fine with it, but Annie seems kinda scared of that, so she might move out as well if Lucy moves out, and then I'd need to look for 2 new flatmates.

Now, why would he move into her room at all? Because our city is extremely crowded and finding a flat is near-impossible, especially since Lucy doesn't make that much money (and her bf won't be able to get a work permit). And if he can't move to our country, they'll probably send him to India.

Right now these are the scenarios:

* I say no and Lucy finds another apartment. She will then either have to move out of this one (which is really beautiful) or let her BF be deported to India. Annie might move out too.
* I say no and Lucy doesn't find another apartment. She stays here, will be mad at me, and her bf gets deported to India.
* I say yes, nobody is mad and the rent gets cheaper for me, but I'd have to live with a couple which would honestly be a nightmare for me, and be exposed to their fighting and fucking sessions.

Maybe I'm not the AH because I'd just be standing my ground and honestly it's not my fault they planned his immigration so badly. On the other hand, i might be the AH because standing my ground will put Lucy in quite the situation.

The doctors said it might be trauma and that it was best to let him take in a bit of information at a time.

My grandpa insisted we never tell him about our parents to spare him the pain and I listen over the years I watched them lie to him and he started to develop this bad image of our parents who were amazing people. Now at 17 he’s really poking around and I’m sure he’ll figure it out sooner or later I’ve been helping “Look” for our parents it really hurts me because whenever I wanna tell him I’m afraid he’ll go mad or something the only reason my parents went out with him that day was because he threw a tantrum and wanted to spend time with both of them and I was sick so I couldn’t go everyone in my family calls it a miracle but in my head it really wasn’t.

61,1f5iq0i,AITA for not letting go of what my mother said?,"Throwaway account. 

I (29F) had a brutal relationship with my father growing up. We were close when I was a child but my teenage years were a nightmare. He was mostly verbally abusive, very rarely physically, but the words hurt the worst anyway. The worst part is he doesn’t even remember how bad he was. Our relationship is somewhat better now through the adult years but I spent years in therapy at least partially because of him and the only reason I’m not still in therapy now is I can’t afford it. I’ve forgiven him but that doesn’t mean I’ve forgotten how much he hurt me. I take comfort in knowing that if our universe is limitless, somewhere out there is a version of me untouched by his careless cruelty. But I’m getting off topic. 

One time, my mother told me that my father never wanted to have kids, but she wanted to so he agreed. It might sound unbelievable but my mother didn’t say this to hurt me. It might be difficult to understand, but I know my mother and she said this because she genuinely thought it would help. She really thought it would make me feel better. It’s hard to explain why she thought that but as I’ve known my mother almost thirty years I can say confidently I know what she was trying to say even if it came out badly. 

She was trying to comfort me, but the words did the opposite. It was like everything snapped into place. Of course my father never wanted kids, that explained so much. When she realized I was hurt by her words she rushed to add that he loved me after I was born, but I already knew that. I know my father loves me but that doesn’t mean he’s a good father and he probably shouldn’t have been one. 

This was years ago now, but I’ve never forgotten these words. 

I don’t want children because I don’t think I am capable of being a good parent. It took time for my mother to accept this but as I’m getting older she has finally resigned to it. It came up the other day and she asked me again why I wouldn’t want to, and I said that I don’t think that people who don’t want kids with their whole heart should have kids. After all my father didn’t want kids and he probably shouldn’t have had them. 

She snapped at me that I needed to forget about that and stop holding on to old wounds, she hadn’t been trying to hurt me. Well I know she wasn’t trying to hurt me but she did. I would give literally anything to unhear those words but I can’t. She didn’t mean for it to happen but I’ll never, ever forget that my father didn’t really want me. It doesn’t matter if he changed his mind when I was born. She shouldn’t have told me that. Parents don’t need to tell their kids everything, indeed there are some things they should never share.

64,1f5ich2,AITA for calling out my friend’s ego?,"I (24M) made a friend A (28M) when moving and starting a new job. We became close fast and were eachother’s primarily social life in the area. 7 months into our friendship, he went through a breakup of his long term LDR. He started to distance. I tried to support him through drug misuse, threw him a birthday party (he told me he was depressed nobody celebrated him the year before), and offered an ear. We started fighting, and he ended our friendship over text. He compared me negatively to his other friends, said I’m high maintenance, and that I confronted too much and I told him he failed to take accountability. I begged despite his clear cutoff, so he rightfully blocked me.

5 months later we reconnected a week after my birthday, and a week before his first of multiple going away parties. We talked and I told him I felt abandoned and he said “I’d never abandon you,” we talked about trauma and stuff and were close the last month he was here. I even helped him move out. He posted me on his Instagram as “[his] best buddy in the [city]”. 

In our time as friends, he
- talked about being able to sleep with anyone on the team he wanted
- made derogatory comments about my close female friend who he had a brief thing with
- frequently talked about being done dirty by management (we had a similar experience, but he told our supervisor he’s not fit to be one)
- frequently complained about our pay difference
- lost another friendship when the friend was vulnerable with us about a girl and he interjected to say they had hooked up multiple times
- went from calling me a best friend, to cutting me off, to best friends again
- would make jokes at my expense (I’m gay) like “can you stop trying to touch me” even when I said it bothered me

In our last interaction over the phone, he told me about his affair with a girl from his past who’s in a 10 year relationship. He flew to see her and stayed with an unknowing friend who’s been asking him to come visit, so her boyfriend wouldn’t find out. He was complaining about her “falling in love with him” cuz he doesn’t want any of that. 

I texted him after saying he should make better choices, he responded “never!” So I told him he’s hurting everyone involved in that situation and that I love him and don’t think that’s aligned with his goals and well-being. He was in the process of moving again, but I asked him if we could please talk. No response after a week, so I confronted him over text saying that this situation is messed up and that I want better for him. Later adding that I feel like our friendship is hinged on his ego and that he should consider how his actions impact others, cuz I don’t want him to feel disliked or done dirty like he’s said. I suggested he talk to someone trusted or a professional about his problems. I’ve tried to engage with him for 3 months, but I’m ghosted.

65,1f5i6b8,AITA for refusing to hold my girlfriend's hand at a funeral?,"Okay, so first of all, context: My girlfriend and I are both pretty close to Omar (23M). I've known Omar considerably longer than Leia has, but they are also somewhat close. Omar's half-brother, Khalid, died recently. He was severely disabled, and it wasn't a shock, but it did hit Omar really hard, and he's been a wreck. Its hard seeing him like this, and about 5 of us are coming with him just for moral support. 

The funeral was on Friday. My girlfriend is a girl, and in Omar's culture any kind of touching between boy and girl is frowned upon. Leia and I both knew this going in, but during the funeral she did get a bit upset and wanted to hold hands or something to comfort herself. Leia didn't actually know Khalid, but she gets upset pretty easily, which is why I did previously suggest she didn't come. 

Omar is a guy, so hugging him was allowed, which I did, a lot. Leia started sulking midway through the funeral, and I may have become more of an asshole here, because I ignored her from then on, and focused on Omar. 

Leia went home early and I stayed with Omar, lying and saying she had to go sort out something with her mum, and i went home later.

Leia is mad at me, and she thinks I should have comforted her, but Omar was my priority. She said that she should always be my priority but I disagree. AITA? I don't think I am, but I feel bad, because even now her sadness is taking a backseat to my worry about Omar. AITA?

66,1f5i0f2,AITA for asking hm friend to stop using the PSN app to see what i’m doing?,"Like the title states, My friend and i have been friends for years and recently i upgraded from a ps4 to a ps5!

My gf had a ps4 already and i had no one else in mind of gifting it to or giving it to. And then i remembered that my friend said she was looking for something free to do in her free time that would keep her from going out to bars and spending money on drinks etc. So i offered to give it to her and she accepted. so i drove 40 minutes to drop it off to her. 

So she discovers on her own the psn app, cool i guess. a nice way to keep up with games and such. i didn’t think it was gonna be used the way it was. 

I have bipolar disorder and sometimes i need a break from social interactions as does anyone! Sometimes i feel like in our friendship im not allowed to have moments where we don’t talk on the phone or text everyday, and to me a friendship shouldn’t have a set schedule to talk and text it should be free. Regardless i put aside my own boundaries because she’s my friend. sometimes i take my own personal space and not answer a few calls sometimes but guys im not one to talk on the phone with anyone all the time. not even my gf.

So we have been playing the game for a few nights in a row, which is fine but i started to notice that my friend is becoming addicted to fortnight and im getting kind of burnt out on the game. We play for 4 hrs during the day and sometimes until 5am after starting to play at midnight and i cant keep playing fortnite back to back like that it’s not that good of a game. but i get it she’s excited. 

We played today for 4 hrs and i got off and left my game on and went to lay down, i get an invite from the psn app while im doom scrolling on insta. That she invited me to a party, the first thing she says is “Fortnite solos? REALLY?” shes mad and sounding confrontational. I feel myself getting irritated and i respond “im laying in bed im not even on the game” and i end the party because i feel like that was a bit weird.

So It’s 10pm and she texts me wyd but i already know that she’s trying to play fortnite. i respond that i just got out of the shower, she doesn’t respond but i don’t think much of it. Because the night before she invited me to a party on the psn app (she has my number btw, this is what bothers me the most for some reason. that she has my number but only invites me to party on the app.) and she tells me she’s going out and she will be back around 1:20am and i’m like okay that’s fine i’ll probably be up but don’t lie to me and have me waiting. 1:20 rolls around and then 1:30 then 2am. I’m not stressing it because she’s an adult and i’m not going to question her because she’s my friend not my Woman. 

So she comes back around 2:30 and gets on and invites me to party. i join and im like “what’s up what happened u had me waiting” she was like “Ohhhh my god i knew u would be mad” i’m like “i’m not mad, u could’ve just told me u we’re gonna be late or something” (me and my gf were gonna watch a movie before she went to bed because she had to be up early around 6 and i wanted to spend time with her but i waited for my friend).

The reason i brung that up was because a few times, there have been instances where she has texted me or called me while i was doing something or simply didn’t want to talk at that moment or i was out or with family and she has checked the psn app to see if i was online and use that against me to confront me about ignoring her. she will text me and be like “your on {game name} but can’t text me back” etc. the first few times were looked up over because i figured it was rude of me. which it was but when i play the game sometimes its a self enjoying moment. 

She’s also not a team player? she will loot my chest im in front of, take my guns when i die, take my guns when im alive, yells at me during the game making it less fun to play, takes the loot from player i kill or my gf kills, steals kills and i end up with 2 kills every game and she has like 13 because she will knock one and rush over to the one im fighting and kill them getting both kills :p. i’m pretty competitive and i used to like playing but she makes it not fun. when i play with her im just watching her kill everyone and take our loot.

sorry anyway, So tonight she joins my party( me and my gf are playing duos, we haven’t had time to really play alone lately) She invites me to a party and i join and im irritated already because i knew it was coming and she just inserted herself into my game. she’s like “what are you doing” im like “well..playing..but im not playing with u tonight” i started off pretty rude but honestly im fed up. ive asked her to please stop using the app to see what im doing and why im not answering etc. we have had this convo before. she’s like “what why” and i say “because (her name) im starting to notice ur taking this game very seriously and ur becoming addicted” shes like “you have been playing this for an hour” and thats when i kind of snapped i say “see this is what i mean, you weren’t even on the game for an hour so that means without my permission you were once again using that app to see what i was doing without even being physically on ur game” she goes “what do u mean i’m not stalking you, it’s weird that you would even say that” 

I say “(her name) i shouldn’t have to ask you multiple times to stop doing something that clearly makes me uncomfortable, normal people don’t go on the psn app and use it against their friends and get on it and invite their friends to a party when they are AWAY from home” she calls me from it in her car, in bars, etc. i know this probably should bother me that much but it does im sorry. she goes “ok well i’ll just unadd you, your being really weird” we say bye and she unadds me and i unplug my mic and my gf is there and i start talking abt it, but i forget that my mic isn’t muted on my controller and my friend stays in the party all the way until im done talking and then leaves. but that is also what im talking about, ur listening to a private conversation im having..

Guys am i tripping ? i genuinely feel bad she had to hear me go off about it but i feel like it needed to happen. im not sure where to go from here either. i think genuinely i might be over the friendship. she causes me more anger than happiness. (for many many more reasons not just the game) she reminds me of my older sister and my parents and she pushes my buttons on purpose. all the time it’s mentally exhausting. and makes me feel bad when i get angry when she purposely does things like this that i don’t like. 

After i asked her to stop doing it AGAIN today, she goes “im not gonna stop, your not gonna get me to stop, you can’t tell me what to do” im not trying to tell you want to do ? i just want to feel like im an adult again without another adult the same age as me constantly expecting me to play the game and using a APP for gaming to see what im doing besides playing with her and texting her..

AITA?

I've had a bunch of fun with r and my sister, we currently have a Minecraft world we're grinding on, I'm on call with them as I'm typing this. R is very nice and he's genuine, not like a fake person, and he didn't do my sister dirty in any way. They broke up because my sister distanced herself from him, to the point they wouldn't speak for days. He is still inlove with her, he's told me. I'm glad he's so passionate about my sister but I can't help but feel jealous.

68,1f5hy2f,AITA for refusing to back down on universities I want to apply to because my father feels the other way?,"I (17F) have been getting the help of my father (45M) in deciding universities I want to apply to because I am in the graduating class of May 2025 in my country. I'm apply for the States, yes, as an international student. Also, something on our finances, my father is full on capable (financially) to pay for my application fees (if not, tuition as well). I have some savings but physically, it's not possible for me to take up part-time jobs and I cannot financially pay around 750$ for 10 more universities that I want to apply for. 

So, here are a few things that happened:

I was finalizing the universities I want to apply for in the Early Decision Deadline (1 and 2) and then Regular Decision Deadline and I chose a total of 20 universities (with safeties). My father then got mad at me saying that he won't be sending me abroad into these ""low-level universities"" which aren't low level by the way, the ""lowest level university"" is still in top 200 qs world ranking and top 50 for CS (that I'm applying for).

(Yes, he gave my an ultimatum to apply to 10 universities, all chosen by him technically but he says I chose them because they're ""good"", i'm not denying that they're good but I'm confident enough in myself and it's good to see my father being confident in me but at the same time, I believe that he should give me a good reason for why i can't apply to universities as safeties since I don't want to have a gap year!!)

I said that if they're going to be like this, I'll ask my teacher (he usually sponsors kids with good grades where their parents refuse to let them continue on with their dreams) to pay for me and then my father got absolutely mad at me, contacting my headmaster and stuff because ""I've been behaving bad at home"". I still refuse to not apply to certain universities as safeties (and honestly, they're better than the universities at my country and I always try for a transfer if I don't get into my dream university but my dad is as adamant as me about his decision.)

AITA?",Everyone Sucks,2024-08-31,"AITA for refusing to back down on universities I want to apply to because my father feels the other way? I (17F) have been getting the help of my father (45M) in deciding universities I want to apply to because I am in the graduating class of May 2025 in my country. I'm apply for the States, yes, as an international student. Also, something on our finances, my father is full on capable (financially) to pay for my application fees (if not, tuition as well). I have some savings but physically, it's not possible for me to take up part-time jobs and I cannot financially pay around 750$ for 10 more universities that I want to apply for. 

So, here are a few things that happened:

I was finalizing the universities I want to apply for in the Early Decision Deadline (1 and 2) and then Regular Decision Deadline and I chose a total of 20 universities (with safeties). My father then got mad at me saying that he won't be sending me abroad into these ""low-level universities"" which aren't low level by the way, the ""lowest level university"" is still in top 200 qs world ranking and top 50 for CS (that I'm applying for). I asked him why he thinks these are low-level and said that if he had a logical reason, I would concede. But he didn't, he keeps repeating, ""I'm your dad and I know better than you"".

I lost many friends, but still have a few who understand my plight. I barely met them the last 2 years, maybe once or twice per year.

I knew he just wanted to have a spot free conscience, and though I wanted to play it safe and not go, I caved and met my friends bc I won’t be seeing them anymore (atleast until I started to work and travel). 

My dad covers all my expenditure, and Ik it sounds unlikely and I might sound spoiled, but it’s mainly because of them. They didn’t let me work when I was able to, forced me to study a degree that’s baseless, and as a foreigner in the most competitive country in the world with mediocre grades, I can’t find a job. I usually do my best and not spend more than $380usd per month. He’s also very controlling, to the point where he controls but wants me to accept that he’s not controlling. Like he kept giving me money to spend this month, and when I didn’t go out, he’ll almost yell at me going “oh so you’re trying to get back at me right, you want me to be hurt so you’re not going out”, so I’m essentially coerced into going out.

I’m sick and tired of this. I already have plans to return them whatever they ever spent on me since I was born. I understand 600 is steep, but he did allow me and he gets notifications everyday too, so I’m confused and anxious. AITA here?

70,1f5hle5,AITA for snitching on my friend?,"I'm in high-school. My friend (we will call him Fred) recently broke up with his girlfriend that he has been dating since the 8th grade (we will call her Anna). ""Recently"" = about a month ago.

​They were a great couple at one time but ended up having some pretty bad problems with conveying their emotions with eachother, which is what led to them breaking up. I am close to Anna, and it is obvious that she has feelings for Fred still. Fred is one of my best friends, but he has not mentioned any feelings that he had for Anna recently. In fact, he has been talking to another girl already. Anna had no idea about this girl.

Anna texted me saying that she wants to be done with him but she believes that he can be good again. I told her (what I believe to be) the truth- she should not get back together with him under any circumstances. She agreed with about 50% certainty.

From what I could piece together from Anna, Fred has absolutely been leading her on and pretty much teasing her with the possibility of a rekindled relationship. Fred has never mentioned this. Again, he is one of my best friends, but I couldn't let Anna get hurt. She was under the impression that her and Fred were talking and one their way to becoming an exclusive couple again. I believe that Fred had told her that he wanted to restart their relationship at some point in the near future.

I ended up telling Anna about the other girl Fred was talking to, which came as a shock to Anna. She confronted him about it. He lied to her. Anna asked if I was lying about it. I sent her screenshots of him saying these things as proof that it was true. Anna must have mentioned my name because Fred confronted me about it, saying that ""we are friends, so I shouldn't have said anything.""

He is still actively talking to the other girl.

If it isn't obvious, I have no intention of trying to get with Anna.

Usually, I am a firm believer in ""Bros before hoes"" but I felt like this was an exception.

73,1f5h7cf,AITA For Trying To Get My Boyfriend's Cat To Stop Humping My Stuff?,"My (23m) boyfriend (29m) and I moved in together last winter and brought our two cats together. They're both neutered males of middle age and after a couple months of them trying to figure out how to live together, they now get along very well. During that time, my cat was the bigger butthole. He used to be the only cat in the apartment, and was a bully, which my boyfriend and I corrected and they now get along very well and have their own territories in the apartment.

Over the span of several months, my boyfriend's cat developed a humping habit. It started with a single fuzzy blanket, and then advanced to being stuffed animals, and then pillows. Now it is every soft surface but mostly my stuffed animals, which is a collection and interest I've had since very young childhood.

I admit it's very silly, however it began to happen a lot and he's bitten holes into and ripped tags off some of the plushies in doing this. I also learned that despite him being neutered, he can still produce ejaculate. I told my boyfriend that I was gonna start trying to redirect him to a special blanket and hiss him away when it's my stuffed animal or pillow. 

This made my boyfriend really upset. He said it would be taking a stress outlet from his cat, and that I was ""f**kin weird"" for it weirding me out. I tried to explain that I don't hate his cat (I actually love him a lot) but I want to avoid him humping my stuff if possible. I have many stuffed animals around the house and I'd have to be putting them on high shelves (which some rooms don't have) every time I left the room, which I really only want to have to do as a last resort. 

He began to insult my cat and call him a bully, and my cat is definitely more standoffish and bratty than his cat. His cat has a very sweet temperament. He got angrier, and said my stuffed animals were stupid and I should get over it, and said that I've stressed him out by complaining about his cat to him this past week. 

This is where I'd be the AH. I called him weird for being so upset with me not wanting his cat to hump my stuffed animals so wanting to try to redirect him, and told him to f**k off because I thought he was being too mean and aggressive over what I saw as a really minor complaint. We continued to argue, and he said I'd either need to put my stuffed animals away, or he'd put his cat down. He then blocked me, so our argument ended.

I don't know what went wrong. I tried to make it clear I knew it was just an animal being an animal, and wanted to redirect, not stop, the behavior. He still said I was the weird one for caring about something like this. I plan to show him this post and the comments no matter what, so, reddit, AITA?

76,1f5gjd5,AITA because I won't hang out with my sister's new boyfriend? ,"So I (37F) live with my sister (35F) and my nephew (12M). I moved in with them 5 years ago.

My sister has had many difficulties in romantic relationships. I'm going to give a rundown of the major and recent ones.

1 In 2010, she met my nephew's dad when she was housesitting for our older sister who was deployed. He convinced her to leave the house several months earlier than our older sister's return. She moved in with him in another state. She left behind two cats and our sister had to scramble to find another friend to come.

2 She moved in with her next boyfriend shortly after breaking up with my nephew's dad. They ended up having terrible fights - in one of these, he destroyed some of my nephew's possessions to ""teach him a lesson"".

3 She got an apartment and started dating again. Within a few months, she and my nephew had moved in with him. He became controlling and authoritarian. His parenting techniques included ""joking"" about locking nephew in a closet or making him sleep in the bathtub.

4 At this point, I moved here (from states away) and we got a house. After a few months, she started dating a guy. He turned out to be an alcoholic, went to rehab 2 or 3 times and he relapsed. Had terrible fights that used to wake me up. He hit her one time I know of.

5/2 She then got back together with guy #2 on this list. He didn't officially move in with us, but didnt have his own place either. He ended up breaking up with her this spring and she was devastated.

Fast forward to a week ago. I get a text saying that her friend was going to come over. It was a man I didn't know, lets call him Michael. She doesn't introduce us, he doesn't introduce himself. I admit i was a little cold to him. He had a drink in his hand and seemed drunk. He stayed over that night.

I later learn that Michael is 23, lives in a camper at his mom's 1 hour away, doesn't have reliable transport, and drinks. They've been dating for 2 weeks. I told my sister it was a bad idea and she called me a karen and judgmental. I said I couldn't control who she dates, but don't want him at the house more than 1-2 nights/week. She said alright.

This week was Nephews birthday. We had plans for him this weekend. She texts me today that she wants to invite Michael. I reply I don't really want to spend time with him and get to know him unless they've been dating for 4-6 months but that I would be friendly in passing. She then texted me that they would be going without me. I said Okay.

Tonight, me her and Nephew went to local roller rink. When we arrive to the spot, guess who is there -- Michael! I didn't protest and tried to have a decent night. Came time to leave, my sister ""informed"" me that Michael would be staying over for tonight and tomorrow. I requested that he come just tomorrow. It turned into a fight and several insults and harsh words were exchanged. She is beyond pissed at me.

I (19) gave a homeless person i met online (20) money. I do not know for sure if they are actually homeless and in need of the money. I think I was the first person to repond to their call for help in a while and that first night i gave them 100$ because i felt bad and giving them money is better than me wasting it on gacha games. It was an impulse decision. 

The next couple of days they would ask me for more to help with groceries and medical bills, and i gave them some, eventually everything given totaled to about 320$. 

So here comes tonight. They message me telling me about how their mom is in the hospital and dying and they need to get bus tickets to go see her a couple states away. I obviously feel terrible and give them some money but dont outright pay what they asked for (350$, i gave 100$) and that is all im willing to give currently. I am just starting college and am jobless so the money i have is all i have to sustain me until i get a job next summer. Ive basically given this person my final paycheck from before i quit and moved. Im not willing to give more and i feel guilty but i also dont know if they are telling me the truth about their situation, i am about 70% sure but there is obviously a little doubt in the back of my mind. I dont want to keep them from seeing their mom one last time but i also dont trust them 100%. I feel so guilty for not giving them more.

78,1f5fsf2,AITA for replying to my ex's text?,"A few days ago, i randomly bumped into my ex in public. That was the first time we saw each other since our breakup last November. We made eye contact but we didn't approach each other or attempt to make conversation. 
I figured he was there to attend the same concert as I am with my best friend. 
I didn't bother reaching out to him or anything as I realised he went with a girl and I myself am in a relationship.
That night after the concert, I decided to tell my boyfriend over call about the incident, reassuring him that it was just a coincidence and a funny incident somewhat, and he was fine with that and had no comment.
The next day, I recieved a text from the ex over Telegram. I had blocked him from almost all platforms I could think off after the breakup but telegram slipped my mind as I never use it for any sort of communication.
He texted 'Thanks for introducing me to [singer]' and i replied him engaging in harmless conversation, i mentioned i was in a relationship and so was he. and mainly talked about the concert itself, discussing the songs that were played. 
The conversation ended shortly and that was that.
I decided to tell my boyfriend about the texts but I couldnt provide any screenshots from the conversation because I deleted the chat right after it ended. Im not sure why i did, as i dont really have anything to hide, I just didnt want to see his name in my inbox as it was going to be the only one there.
My boyfriend got a bit mad and said that he couldnt trust me because I texted him and that he doesnt believe a word I say after I deleted the chat. 
Now im thinking that it wouldve been harmless and this couldve been avoided if i didnt bring it up in the first place.

79,1f5frkb,AITA asked partner to close curtains before bed,"I just want some feedback on my reaction. 

Context: We are going to bed and have east facing windows, with the hurricane a few weeks ago it took out a large pine tree in our yard that blocked some of the light coming in the window in the morning. We have black out curtains which I have started to pull close before bed to keep it dark. I’ve had trouble sleeping the last few weeks and this has been helpful. I’ve mentioned I enjoy having the curtains closed and opening them in the morning. It’s been a routine I’ve been taking on. 

Story:
Just before bed as I turn out the night light and the room goes black the windows are glowing and I sigh a little since I forgot and did not want to get out of bed to close them. I sleep on the side farthest from the windows and so I ask my partner if they could close them for me. The answer was no he said he likes them open, it’s like a nightlight or a TV. I said okay and paused some before explaining it’s a bit too bright and I haven’t been sleeping well and if he could close them. He said meet in the middle and left some space open. All was fine and I know I should have just let it go but something in me was really hurt. I don’t normally ask for little things, typically I do it myself but before asking tonight I thought how sweet it would be if I asked and he closed them for me. I guess the crush I felt was a bit over the top but as he is trying to cuddle and we go to bed I mention how I was upset about the curtains, it made me feel like he didn’t care. It turned into an argument where he said he spent all day helping me ( which was nice he did even when I said he didn’t have to and could stay home) and I was a supportive partner all day too. I said it was irrelevant I was just sad about the curtains and how I felt it would be sweet and he said I was being dramatic and we should go to bed and he did technically close them. I just felt really unheard and he could t see that part. Towards the end it wasn’t about curtains but he said this was crazy and dramatic. I got up huffed over to the curtains and pulled them shut all the way and went to bed. 

So was I an asshole about the curtains?

Update:

Okay thanks for the outside perspectives. I was disappointed his first response was he thought it was soothing to have the light coming in and I took it personally after having to ask again and explain my sleep preference. I apologized and said sorry about the curtains.

The problem is that recently, she’s been making very aggressive statements like how I’m “obese,” will gain “not freshmen 15 but freshmen 50” because I sleep a lot—and will “never survive in a top college”—all the while I’ve never even applied to one. The application isn’t even open, for God’s sake.

On top of it, she keeps trying to make a fool out of me by saying that I’m “not my brother,” who went to a T10 school, because I’m not as smart, and I’m “unathletic.”

For context, I’m 5’4”/144lbs, and have been working out since freshmen year.

So because I don’t want to get in an argument, I stopped responding to her baits and today, she just talked shit about me “whispering” in front of our mutual friend about what an asshole I was for ignoring her and being “uncommunicative,” all the while glancing at me while I tried to ignore her and studied for the test next period, which I said I’d do in the beginning. She also said she “felt hurt” because I once said that I brought her into the friend group and wouldn’t have met each other otherwise, which … why would she get hurt at that?

I feel like I should’ve done something, but right now I feel like an asshole because all my mutual friends are saying that I should apologize to her, although I’m not sure what to apologize for. Was I wrong to ignore her?

AITA Business, Rent and Power Bill

Hi Reddit, please help me look at this situation I am in.

Am I the Asshole?

Here is the situation:

I am split 51%(me) 49%(partner) for a business that rents out my house. My house came with an initial set of Solar Panels that IS included in the mortgage of $2800 and is covered by the business rent. This initial set of panels is largely inefficient as the most I have seen it drop the power bill was maybe less than $80.

A 2nd set of panels was installed for the home under my name with the idea that the business would have increased power consumption. This is on a separate loan that I am paying for, about $300 monthly. These additional panels keep the power bill negative even under heavy load.

My business partner is unwilling to have the business pay for the 2nd set of panels. 

This would effectively make rent about $3100 with a negative electricity bill.

Since she has been refusing the last few times I had asked, I stated I would have to turn off the 2nd set of panels since I am paying for them and not the business.  I would just turn off the 2nd set of panels. My business partner was not happy about this. However, I told that it was unfair that I pay for the loan on the panels but the business gets to both have NO electricity bill and NO solar panel bill. 

With the 2nd set of panels off the monthly consumption of power would creep upwards of $400 on cold months and $700 on hot months when the AC is blasting.

So $3100 monthly with no electricity bill, but the business pays for the panels? Or $2800 monthly, no 2nd set of panels, and a high power bill.

Am I the asshole for suggesting I turn off the 2nd set of panels? I own both sets of the panels and the home. The business is only paying for the first set of panels and not the 2nd set. I should be able to turn them off if I am not being reimbursed by the business.

TL;DR at the bottom

my sister (F teenager) has struggled finding a ""best friend"" for the longest time. it has been one of her biggest challenges socially, and as her older sister, i could for sure relate to it.

me and her never had what you would call a “typical” sister relationship (fighting, arguing, blah blah), i feel as if it was a lot worse than that. like we literally cannot go one day without a screaming match. i believe that it's mostly my fault that we became like this, i'm autistic and have an extreme ""black and white"" thinking.

my point is that she never really opens up to me in general, especially not about her feelings.

late last school year up to this school year, she became pretty close with a girl in her grade. i was chill around her, but didn't really get to see her all that much when she came over, they would usually be in her room (in the basement).

i started talking to her a bit more as the summer came around and she could hang out a lot more often, and we actually had a lot in common.

one night, she was sleeping over just after me and my sister came home from our lakehouse where i snuck peach schnapps home. i found out that my sister's friend also liked to drink so we drank the entire bottle of schnapps and had multiple shots of whiskey.

after that we became a lot more closer, but my sister started feeling like i was taking her friend from her. the friend & i both agreed that we didn't feel that way, but OF COURSE i cannot decide what my sister can and cannot feel.

basically, i couldn't see her that much anymore because my sister would lock me out and yell for my parents. the only time me and her ""hung out"" by ourselves was when we snuck out to the gas station, got snacks, then walked to the park & stayed there until 4 AM.

today, she texts me asking if we could hang out next week. i knew & respected that my sister would (obviously) disapprove of this, so i asked her for permission out of respect.
she had a bunch of questions, and i knew that she was taken by surprise by it. she asked things like ""with me? without me? when is it? where are you gonna go?"" & i literally could not answer any of them because we didn't actually plan anything.

she quickly got irritated, told me that the friend left her on delivered for 3 days. i felt really bad because i knew she was really hurt, now im debating making up an excuse to not hang w the friend.

like if hanging out with her by ourselves is going to hurt my sister, then i'll have to see her when they hang out at my house. on the other hand, though, i really do want to hang out with her. 

TL;DR- my sister has a friend that i became friends with while we were violently drunk one night, sister doesn't like us hanging out bc she thinks i'm taking friend away from her. the friend asks to hang out w/o my sister and idk what to do, asked sister permission and she was vague, dont wanna hang w the friend if my sister will become hurt over it

I showed him a picture from my social media, & since it was on Instagram, he saw my handle & said he’d follow me. I didnt ask or suggest it. Given our previous chats, I thought we were friendly enough to connect on Instagram.

We only messaged a couple of times on Instagram. I sent a meme, he replied with another, & we briefly talked about not liking work. These messages were after work hours—I sent the first at 6 PM, & he replied around 9 PM.

I began worrying about what I could post now that a coworker was following me, so I unfollowed him to avoid concerns about what I post on my private page.

Additionally, he was working on a report I had delegated. I want to clarify that Im not his manager; we’re just on the same team. He rarely completed work without multiple requests for updates, so asking wasnt unusual.

Our team had a happy hour this week, which he had said he would join. I got his number from his work profile & reached out a few days before, around 6 PM on a Friday, to see if he was available. Something came up, & I never responded to his question about who was texting—I just forgot. On Monday, he didnt show up to the office or the event. I asked why he didnt join, but he didnt respond.

On Thursday, I sent a message through Teams for a report update. He replied, stating that he’d gone to my manager, my managers manager, & his contractor agency about me texting him. He also said I shouldnt contact him outside of work for non-work matters & asked me to only use Teams or Outlook.

The next day, I found out he quit & requested that no one contact him & that his privacy be respected.

We only messaged a couple of times on Instagram. I sent a meme, he replied with another, & we briefly talked about not liking work. These messages were after work hours—I sent the first at 6 PM, & he replied around 9 PM.

I began worrying about what I could post now that a coworker was following me, so I unfollowed him to avoid concerns about what I post on my private page.

Additionally, he was working on a report I had delegated. I want to clarify that Im not his manager; we’re just on the same team. He rarely completed work without multiple requests for updates, so asking wasnt unusual.

Our team had a happy hour this week, which he had said he would join. I got his number from his work profile & reached out a few days before, around 6 PM on a Friday, to see if he was available. Something came up, & I never responded to his question about who was texting—I just forgot. On Monday, he didnt show up to the office or the event. I asked why he didnt join, but he didnt respond.

On Thursday, I sent a message through Teams for a report update. He replied, stating that he’d gone to my manager, my managers manager, & his contractor agency about me texting him. He also said I shouldnt contact him outside of work for non-work matters & asked me to only use Teams or Outlook.

The next day, I found out he quit & requested that no one contact him & that his privacy be respected. Given our previous interactions, I thought we were friendly enough to reach out, but now Im questioning that. Im struggling to understand what I did wrong, if anything. AITA?",1.0,0.13639264,0,0
91,1f5eby3,AITA for not taking my wife as my plus one?,"ETA: FIANCE, NOT WIFE, MY MISTAKE.

Alright, I'm going to be honest here, me (25M) and my fiance, Lily (26F), are not currently in the best financial situation. I have student debt, and although I have a consistent job thanks to my degree, I've still got quite some way to go until I'm at a stable position (especially with us both saving up for our wedding).

Despite this, my best friend, James (25M), who is in a different financial situation to me, often invites me to events held by his dad, or family occasions which he can get me into. We've been close since we were like 6, and got even closer when he was put in my foster home for a while (they couldn't find his dad). The thing is James and his dad have a somewhat strained relationship, with his dad being kind of snobby, so James usually lends/buys me something to fit in on the day of the event, which obviously, costs him money. I used to protest when I was younger, but james doesn't like going to those things on his own, and I've gotten accustomed to letting get me things.

Next weekend, James' dad is holding some sort of garden party, and James as usual invited me. Lily was annoyed, and asked if I could take her as my plus one. I mentioned that there's usually a pretty strict dress code and I don't want James to get in trouble with his dad (they have a weird relationship) Lily said that James could just do what he usually does, which is get her something to fit in. I said I wasn't going to ask one of my closest friends for more money and/or mess up his relationship with his dad more than it already is.

Lily was really mad, and said this meant I didn't care about her, because James clearly didn't have a problem 'forking over' for me and all she was doing was suggesting I ask. I don't know, I'm in a tough spot here and I just think it would be weird to invite another guest on James' dime. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-08-31,"AITA for not taking my wife as my plus one?

92,1f5d7va,AITA For Not Following Up With A Friend In Town,"I (40f) live across the country from a good friend (42f). She recently asked me, while on the phone, if a certain ticket price was reasonable for flying place X, which is where I happen to live. I asked her if she was coming to town and she noted that she had forgotten to tell me about it but theat she was coming to town because her family cruise was departing from the port in my city. I talk this person several times a week, sometimes for hours. We've had ph convos that are 8+ hours long and I consider her a good friend but I don't see her as often since I moved away and she also has had a child since. I assumed that as the date got closer we would make plans to meet up. Note, I'm single and currently between jobs but she is a single mom and was coming with her parents. Her schedule has more constraints right now than my own.

The date gets here, she gets into town and since she hasn't mentioned any plans, I ask if she wants to do something the first day they are in town (they're in town two days before the cruise leaves). I even mention what I'll be up to, something they could join, or we could do something else. She says she'll need to see how everyone feels after the flight and will get back to me. That was totally fine by me since she has older parents, a toddler, and it was a cross country flight. 

The next time I hear from her, it's a text asking what are some good places to eat around one of the main downtown attractions. I gave her some suggestions but I didn't invite myself. After all, she said she'd get back to me when it was convenient to do something. I don't say anything but the days go by and I assume they got on the cruise and we never met up.

At this point, two weeks have gone by. The cruise was a week long and I know they've probably been back home a week. Weve never gone this long without speaking so i cant tell if she feels miffed or if she's dead or what. I haven't heard from her but I also haven't bothered to reach out. I know she was coming to my city so maybe I should have pushed more to do this and that but she also just booked a vacation in the city I live in and didn't even seem to coordinate if I'd even be around. 

I will say, she's done this before. In the same manner. I have a winter home in socal and she did the same thing asking about tix prices, telling me she forgot to tell me she was coming. However, that time that she was coming in, I was on a vacation some where else, as it was around the holidays. They are popular destinations but not soooooo popular you'd always be going through them like LA or NYC. I feel it's a little weird she wouldn't try to coordinate a 2200+ mile trip to where we could see each other or am I supposed to be the one to pick up the slack. It's like she's being weirdly passive aggressive about it. When i go back  to her town, i give dates and just ask if she'll be free or not and we set a time/place.

94,1f5cnv9,AITA for leaving my sister in another country? ,"EDIT: In response to me wanting to do my own thing this morning, I was told her name is on the reservation and kicked out of our room. I went to breakfast and she said she didn’t mean it and it was the “heat of the moment.” There’s no guarantee I won’t find myself homeless or threatened with it, so I’m finding somewhere else to stay.

—

My sister and I are in the UK on an international trip. Our relationship had many challenges growing up, some specific to being twins, but honestly my sister can just be a b-word. 

She blames her anxiety (I have it too but I  don’t treat people like crap because of it). We planned this bday celebration all year and came up with a plan for when she’s in anxious mode/lashing out. I was told not to take it personally and to just “give her grace” and let her get it out (emotionally bully me) til she feels okay. 

Yes, I’m an idiot for agreeing to do this trip. 

We didn’t even make it through the first day without an issue: **She leaves me everywhere we go.** 

I have videos of her walking halfway down the block ahead of me. At one point I was going to duck off behind a flat just to see how long it took her to realize I wasn’t behind her. 

I asked her was she okay because I didn’t understand why we aren’t walking together. She just said I walk too slow and need to keep up with her. Whether she’s a fast walker or I’m “too slow”, I have just never been out with another person and they just leave me behind. It confirms a lot of my suspicions over the years that she legit doesn’t like or me respect me as a person.  

And she can’t use her anxiety as an excuse. 

She’s just being mean and she only treats me this way. Her husband said if she’s in a rush she’ll take off, which is understandable. But We were taking a leisure walk back to our hotel after dinner! We have guests joining us in 4 days and I bet my entire bank account she will NOT do this to them. She has gone on vacay with her friends, I know she doesn’t do this to them. She wouldn’t do this to our family, or anybody else. 

I would like to do my own thing going forward.

Now I’m aware that comes with a safety hazard for us both. And I will be getting extensive calls from America about why I’m wrong. But this is exactly how it goes: I REACT to her behavior and I’m the bad guy for not sucking it up and dealing with her shit. When we were younger I would be forced to apologize because “she isn’t as mature, please be the bigger person.” 

I legit don’t have to put up with this.  I’m supposed to deal with this passive aggression for another 4 days? 

When we got back to the hotel, I stayed in the lobby for a while to decompress. I get back to the room 30 mins later and she’s on the phone with her husband and saying “well she’s mad I keep leaving her. That not my problem, she should keep up with me.” 

I’m not interested in fighting or having a walking power struggle. I can have a much better trip by myself. I’m in travel groups looking for some girls to connect with in the area and on dating apps to meet a new friend. Again, I’m mindful I’m in another country, but I want to actually enjoy this trip I paid for and I don’t want to be with someone who treats me like I’m a nuisance.

95,1f5bxkt,AITA for telling my husband I don’t want to throw my daughter a huge birthday party?,"
I created a reddit account just to talk about this. My youngest daughter just turned one a couple of days ago. Since both me and my husband had work we decided to celebrate on the weekend. After what happened when my oldest turned one I told my husband that I didn’t want to throw a huge party. 

For context my MIL invited all her church friends to my house without my knowledge. What I  thought was a small get together with my family turned into 20 family members and friends on my husband’s side that i’ve never met before. Also I haven’t walked into a church in like 8 years. They ate all of my food and trashed the place. Not to mention the fact that most of them showed up empty handed. I spent the majority of the time sitting alone on the couch chugging wine as my kid was being tossed around by people i’ve never seen before. 

When the party was over my MIL left with them leaving me to clean up after them. I spent hours throwing away trash and mopping the floor because they also all wore shoes in the house. My husband said he was gonna put my daughter to bed, shower, then help me clean but he never came downstairs. Needless to say I cried that night scrubbing dirt out my carpets. 

I told my husband this and he got super mad at me. He has this idea that I hate his mom which is not true at all. I love that woman to death but she has no respect for my boundaries. 

I’ve told her so many times to not feed my youngest certain food because my pediatrician said shes not ready. But of course I come to put her up and my MIL is showing it down her throat. Her logic is that  because she had 4 kids she’s an expert on how to raise them. She keeps buying clothes that are too big or too small for my kids but if I don’t  put it on them my husband will throw a fit. I hate to talk bad about her because I know her intentions at heart are good. 

I know that it’s her granddaughter too and she wants it to be special but at the end of the day i’m just so fucking tired. Obviously I want my daughter to have a good birthday but it’s not like she’s going to remember any of this. 

My husband says that I should appreciate that his mom even cares enough about us to throw a party. I do feel guilty saying I don’t want her at my house when she’s done so much for us. I’ve told my sister about this and she’s on my side but I don’t know what to think anymore. Sometimes just feel so alone. Like everything I say or do is wrong. What do you guys think?

UPDATE: Firstly, I want to say thank you so much for all the support and advice you guys gave me. It really means the world to me! 

I posted this Friday night, and the “party” was supposed to be today. The post blew up pretty quickly, so I had time to message her. I saw that a lot of people suggested to have the party at her house so I texted her that. She replied saying that her house is ‘too small’ for such a special event. 

For the first time in my life, I grew a pair of fucking balls and told her that my house my was unavailable. If she still wanted the party to happen she needed to find another venue, and that if she showed up with guests, she wouldn’t be welcomed in. Honestly my heart dropped when I sent that message. She didn’t reply but I assumed she called my husband immediately after because he came home furious. 

He said that I had no right to not let his mother into our house. I told him that if it was that deep, his mom could find another way to praise around our kid without invading our home. He gave me the silent treatment for the rest of the night but honestly I didn’t want to talk to him either. 

I barely got any sleep last night, thinking about what everyone commented. I’m not sure what i’m more embarrassed about, marrying a man who disrespects me or needing the internet to point out how bad i’ve been treated. Some suggesting couples therapy, but I don’t even know if I can handle being in the same room as him. I’m just so mad at myself for letting things get this bad. I told myself that I wouldn’t repeat the cycle of bad relationships I saw growing up but apparently I continued it even further. I’m so disappointed in myself. At the end of the day all I want is for my kids to be safe and happy.

Today I woke up and went downstairs to see my MIL’s shoes at the front door. I immediately went back upstairs, packed a bag for me and the kids, and left without even looking at her. I walked out with a bag on my shoulder, and holding by my children by the hand. I tried not to breakdown crying as I drove down the road. My oldest asked where we were going and I just said “to celebrate.”

My husband immediately started blowing up my phone so I texted him that I decided to host the party at our local park, and if he and his mom wanted to come, they could.

I went to Walmart, and bought cheap decorations and some cupcakes. A lot of you suggested to invite close friends, but the sad truth is, I don’t really have any. My family lives in a different state and since moving here, my life has been all about work and taking care of the kids. 

I pulled up to the park and set things up on one of the picnic tables. It was just the three of us, and it felt so much more peaceful. We sang happy birthday and I let her smash the cupcake into her face. We stayed there for a couple of hours, with my daughter running wild on the playground and I played catch with the birthday girl. It was the happiest i’ve ever been in a while.

My husband and MIL never showed up, which honestly surprised me. I expected them to storm in, yelling. But if they had, I knew I was going to stand my ground. I don’t know how it took me so long to realized that they both see me as doormat they can walk all over.

After the park, we walked around the mall while my little one slept in the stroller. I knew my MIL would still be at my house, so I booked a room in a small hotel. Maybe that’s a bit dramatic but I really don’t know what else to do. She hasn’t reached out yet.

 I think i’m gonna go back tomorrow morning and leave the kids at a daycare for a bit. it’s been a rough 24 hours, but for now, i’m gonna eat ice cream as dinner with my daughters and savor this moment. I’ll let you  guys if there’s any more updates!

I walked out with a bag on my shoulder, and holding by my children by the hand. I tried not to breakdown crying as I drove down the road. My oldest asked where we were going and I just said “to celebrate.”

My husband immediately started blowing up my phone so I texted him that I decided to host the party at our local park, and if he and his mom wanted to come, they could.

I went to Walmart, and bought cheap decorations and some cupcakes. A lot of you suggested to invite close friends, but the sad truth is, I don’t really have any. My family lives in a different state and since moving here, my life has been all about work and taking care of the kids. 

I pulled up to the park and set things up on one of the picnic tables. It was just the three of us, and it felt so much more peaceful. We sang happy birthday and I let her smash the cupcake into her face. We stayed there for a couple of hours, with my daughter running wild on the playground and I played catch with the birthday girl. It was the happiest i’ve ever been in a while.

My husband and MIL never showed up, which honestly surprised me. I expected them to storm in, yelling. But if they had, I knew I was going to stand my ground. I don’t know how it took me so long to realized that they both see me as doormat they can walk all over.

After the park, we walked around the mall while my little one slept in the stroller. I knew my MIL would still be at my house, so I booked a room in a small hotel. Maybe that’s a bit dramatic but I really don’t know what else to do. She hasn’t reached out yet.

 I think i’m gonna go back tomorrow morning and leave the kids at a daycare for a bit. it’s been a rough 24 hours, but for now, i’m gonna eat ice cream as dinner with my daughters and savor this moment. I’ll let you  guys if there’s any more updates!

96,1f5bx51,WIBTA if I told my (41F) son (23M) to apply to worse schools?,"My son got his bachelors in biology last year, and since then he’s been applying to medical schools. He applied last year, and got rejected, and is applying again. From what he’s told me, it wasn’t an issue with his grades, but just that getting accepted to med schools is a crap shoot. He said he has “a 515 MCAT and a 3.7 GPA”. To be honest, I have no idea if that’s good or bad. 

Anyways, I’ve been talking about his plans about what happens if he doesn’t get in this year. He mentioned that there’s an entire group of schools that he hasn’t applied to, that he might apply to next year as a backup if he doesn’t get in! They’re called “D.O. schools”. Apparently there’s multiple degrees that doctors can get, and the MD is better than the DO. He didn’t apply DO last year annd isn’t going to apply DO this year even though there’s still time.

I asked him what was wrong with DO schools. He said that he wanted to do surgery, and that DOs couldn’t become surgeons. He said that doing non-surgical careers wasn’t as interesting, and that they paid less. First off, I don’t know who he’s trying to fool, but I know for a fact he has wanted to be a psychiatrist since he was in middle school. According to him, that’s a career that DOs can do. Second, I asked him how much money non-surgeons make. He said they make around $250,000 - $400,000! I was a single-mom when I was 18 years old. We survived off my $30,000 and my father’s $50,000. I don’t know where he got the nerve to think that $250,000 isn’t a blessing directly from God, and I kind of got angry when he said he wanted a minimum salary of $500,000.

I tried pushing into his reasoning a little bit more. He said that DOs were kind of looked down on. I didn’t even know that there were multiple types of doctors five minutes ago. He said he didn’t want to live with a chip on his shoulder for the rest of his life. He has wanted to be a doctor his whole life, and now suddenly all these obstacles are popping up, as if prestige or reputation matters. It started when he went to college, I think. He got a full ride scholarship to a private university near our town. I’ve met his friends, and they’re from rich families. I think they got into his head and are making him focus on the wrong things.

I want him to get on with his life. I don’t think spending years chasing two different letters is a good use of his time. Also, based on the stories he’s told me of surgeons spending 7 years with 120 hour weeks, I secretly don’t think he’s cut out for surgery. I’m thinking that I’m going to tell him that he needs to get his stick out his ass and apply to these DO schools. I get that he has dreams of being a surgeon, but his dreams can’t get in the way of a life without financial struggles. WIBTA if I tell him to just suck it up and apply DO?

97,1f5bnrm,AITA for telling my roommates gf to help with bills,"My roommate’s (Noah 22) gf (Ella 21) is spending a lot of time in our apartment. I didn’t mind when she use to only visit a couple of days out of the week but now I feel like I’m seeing her most days and something has got to give. 

My biggest issue is how she uses our communal things like she’s paying for them. She showers here, uses our sink water, and has even done laundry. She always leaves lights on at night bc she’s scared of the dark. She cooks on our stove & Noah turns the thermostat up when she visits bc she gets cold which adds electric.

I tried to tell Noah that Ella is over so much she needs to help with bills. I don’t think he took me seriously because he laughed and went on about his day so I figured my best option was to talk to Ella directly. 

At a party last night I asked her if Noah had talked to her about the bills yet. She said no. I told her since she was over at our apartment so much she needed to start contributing to our bills. 

She asked me if I was serious and I said yes. She said she only came over when Noah asked & didn’t realize she was bothering anyone. I told her I’m only bothered if she doesn’t start to contribute. She said she can’t contribute, she doesn’t have a job, and there’s no other way to see Noah bc her sorority house doesn’t allow boys to go into the rooms. I suggested she should limit how much she comes over then.

She didn’t say anything else to me and left to find Noah. They found me minutes later and Noah once again asked me if I was being serious. I said yes and explained all of her added expenses. He laughed in my face then asked if I would be satisfied if they started taking showers together to save water. I said no, I don’t want to shower in their cess pool. 

He said I was being ridiculous and began trying to break down my argument. He said she cooks for the both of them, not just her, so there’s no difference in electricity. Just who’s doing the labor. The problem with that statement is I’ve seen her make personal meals before, which I pointed out.

By this point he seemed really annoyed with me. He said he’d start walking behind her at night to turn out the lights, if she needed something spontaneously washed he’d throw his dirty sock in with hers so it would be their combined laundry, he’d start cooking the food for them, they’d combine toilet flushes, and he’d clean out their cess pool after their joint shower. 

I knew he was mocking me so I said that actually cleaning out their cess pool would require extra water so she would need to contribute to bills regardless or at least cut back on the number of days she visited the apartment. 2-3 days a week  seemed fair. 

Noah called me a broke, penny-pinching asshole and left. I went to talk to my other two roommates about the ordeal but they said that they didn’t want in the middle of it. I had felt justified but my roommates lack of rallying with me on this makes me have my doubts.

98,1f5bkk4,WIBTA If I told my roommate to stop taking calls in the dorm and interfered with her situationship?,"I moved in with my college roommate named Joy (fake name) two weeks ago. We share a two bed dorm together, so the chance of conflict is already high. Within a few days it was clear to me we were complete opposites. Joy is in a much higher tax bracket than me. She wears clothes that are hundreds of dollars and brags about her dad's money all the time. By the third day, she had already spread rumours about my sexuality. It sucked, but I put up with it. 

The current problem arose by the end of the second week. Joy is on the phone all the time with her situationship name Jake (another fake ass name). To the point I'm goimg nuts. They constantly fight and she constantly belittles the guy. He's from her home state so everything is done on the phone. What's worse is if I try to talk at all or do anything, she will tell me to shut up so she can talk to Jake. I'm someone who relatively avoids conflict, so I just kind of do what she says. 

Jake is basically head over heels for Joy. He's a year younger than her and a senior in highschool, so I think some of the appeal is her being an ""older girl"" (even if itd only by a year). Every phone call I witness she's extremely toxic. She'll play the victim card and continuously repeat ""are you mad at me?"" while he is incredibly patient. Jake's doesn't only thing is he wants to be exclusive, and while she wants him to be loyal, Joy wants to sleep around. I don't have much comment on this part, but it's now she's acting very spoiled and threatening to ""ruin his life"" if he leaves or does anything with other girls. She has also started to say stuff like she gets everything and every guy that she wants in life as another means to threaten him. Then gets upset whenever I point out that sounds spoiled and bratty.

I have two things I want to do that may make me an asshole, or the very least an idiot 

1. I want to tell her to stop taking her calls in the dorm room if she wants to talk that much. 

2. I want to reach out to Jake and tell him to not be involved with her anymore.

I fear I'll be the asshole because I haven't actually given her any signs I don't like how she's acting. She talks about how patient we are and how we never have any fights. I don't want to come off as controlling. I also know it's not my place to be involved in their strange situationship.  I'm just worried about the guy because he is incredibly patient and wanting her affection, while she is manipulative towards him.

I (F25) just turned 25 today. My family always takes me to my favorite restaurant to celebrate, nothing fancy. I just like to spend time with my loved ones on my special day.

For some context, my bf Drew (M31) and I are currently in a long-distance relationship as I had to quit my job in his city and go back to mine. We've been 9 months together in total and 6 months long distance. Idk if this matters but we're 2h away from each other and visiting is quite inexpensive.

This year my younger brother has very busy Fridays because of college, so we're celebrating tomorrow. I already knew this a week ago, so I planned around it and I also asked my boyfriend if he was ok with the day and if he could make it, he said yes and that he was going to come see me one day (my birthday) before so we could go on a date just us two. Well, yesterday my bf told me he couldn't make it today because he was waiting for some deposits and had no money. I told him not to worry and I'd see him on Saturday as i originally planned.

Today my bf called me to tell me he finally got his money, **but** wasn't going to make it because his family last minute decided celebrating grandmas birthday on Saturday instead of Sunday (her birthdate) and he would visit me on Monday. Of course I got pissed and he noticed and immediately told me he would try to make it tomorrow night but I told him not to bother and then hung up.

The problem here is that my bf always ditches me for his family. We can have something planned and suddenly he cancels or changes the date because some family member asked for his help. At this point I feel I'm his partner only when his family is not around.

No, I don't know his parents because they think we're not in a committed relationship (because of the amount of time we've been dating) and won't allow me at their house.

And yes, with this situation I've had enough. I think we can save the relationship if he commits, but I don't even know where to start talking as i'm meeting my bf in person to talk about this in 2 or 3 days.

If we take her anywhere she’d pick up things and put them in her pocket and bring them home. She’s stolen watches, jewelry, trinket boxes, perfumes etc. the worst thing she stole was my nana’s wedding ring. When my cousin caught her she was shamed in front of everyone and was banned from coming over until she got it all under control. My aunt suggested therapy but my parents shot it down saying that she’ll grow out of it.

On to the recent issue. My mom took me and my sister to the mall to do some shopping. We went to stores like Claire’s, Nike, Old Navy and so on. Why am I mentioning these stores? They will be important later. The last place we went to was Victoria Secret. My sister wanted to browse around. My mom left us to go answer a call and I lost my sister in the store. I found her in the discount section looking at lip glosses and the mini perfumes and bag charms. 

She told me that she was just looking and to relax cause she didn’t take anything. I was relieved because I only lost her for 2 minutes. Fast forward to when we got home we went to our rooms to unpack what we bought. I walked past my sister’s room and saw her with more stuff than I remembered her getting. In the pile was VS lip glosses, a card of Claire’s earrings and some bracelets from a kiosk at the mall. 

I was shocked and asked her why would she steal these things? All she had to do was ask mom to buy them and she would’ve gotten them.

If we take her anywhere she’d pick up things and put them in her pocket and bring them home. She’s stolen watches, jewelry, trinket boxes, perfumes etc. the worst thing she stole was my nana’s wedding ring. When my cousin caught her she was shamed in front of everyone and was banned from coming over until she got it all under control. My aunt suggested therapy but my parents shot it down saying that she’ll grow out of it.

On to the recent issue. My mom took me and my sister to the mall to do some shopping. We went to stores like Claire’s, Nike, Old Navy and so on. Why am I mentioning these stores? They will be important later. The last place we went to was Victoria Secret. My sister wanted to browse around. My mom left us to go answer a call and I lost my sister in the store. I found her in the discount section looking at lip glosses and the mini perfumes and bag charms. 

She told me that she was just looking and to relax cause she didn’t take anything. I was relieved because I only lost her for 2 minutes. Fast forward to when we got home we went to our rooms to unpack what we bought. I walked past my sister’s room and saw her with more stuff than I remembered her getting. In the pile was VS lip glosses, a card of Claire’s earrings and some bracelets from a kiosk at the mall. 

I was shocked and asked her why would she steal these things? All she had to do was ask mom to buy them and she would’ve gotten them. She begged me not to tell mom but I did anyways and now she’s being punished. She can’t go to her friend’s sleepover party, she can’t have her iPad and she didn’t allowed her phone.

107,1f5vvtl,WIBTA if I went ahead and biked against my partner’s wishes?,"About a month ago, I got into a minor cycling accident. It wasn't serious in that I didn't break anything or get a concussion, but I had to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance and looked pretty bad for a week or so afterwards. 

I understand that it was traumatic for my partner to answer a phone call coming from my phone but hear my friend's voice on the other line telling them that I was rushed to the ER. I'll also never forget the look on their face and how she had to hold back tears after seeing how bad I looked before my wounds were treated. 

I've been feeling way better for the past two weeks and itching to go cycling again especially with the warm weather ending soon. Every time I would bring it up, however, they'd tell me that they weren't ready for me to ride again. At first, I didn't push it because I knew how seeing me in that condition hurt my partner. 

Over the past few days, I've begun to more seriously say that I want to get back at it. After some discussion, they gave me some conditions under which they'd be comfortable: 

1. That I not be alone when I ride -- A bit of a hassle because it means I can't have spur of the moment rides but not a dealbraker
2. Do short ~20km rides -- Okay for weekday after work rides when I just wanna do a quick workout but waaayyyy too short for my weekend rides
3. Wear ""protective"" gear -- Ridiculous. I always wear a helmet when I ride but they mean things like kneepads, etc.

At this point it feels like they just don't want me to do it anymore and that's a no go for me. I WANT to get their blessing before I ride again and I'm willing to talk it out but if she flat out says no or insists on conditions that would make me not enjoy doing it, I'm inclined to just do it anyway.

During the day he helped me pick out a long black dress with heels and picked my jewelry out. I’m thinking we’re going to go somewhere fancy and nice but no he took me to eat seafood boil. I was so pissed when we got there because I looked so out of place to be wearing heals and a long black dress. During this week he kept asking me what food I liked and cake but I have already told him so many times before of what I like. I just wanted him to put in effort in what I would liked to eat. I feel like he didn’t put in much effort to really think about what I liked When it was his birthday I planned a lot out for him months in advance and he planned my birthday a week before. He planned to take me to eat seafood boil and included my friends and family but we just had it a couple of weeks ago with his mom and sister to me it felt like he didn’t put effort into the restaurant and I didnt want it when we got there. In the car I told him “why would you take me here when I am dressed like this I don’t want seafood boil I’m not in the mood for it and I’m bloated I’m about to start my period.” He yelled at me and called me ungrateful. I get why he would call me ungrateful but I just thought of you have money to take me to eat seafood boil you have money to take me somewhere else and he never looked at other restaurants to see what I would like or make reservation.

109,1f5dkbt,AITA for cutting matted hair off my aunts dogs?,"Given they do look a bit bald in some areas, but the poor dogs had so many mattings all over their legs :((. I cut the huge mattings slowly and made sure not to cut their skin and the dogs let me😊. I thought about shaving but the shaver didnt have battery. Though I avoided the ears and nose because I worry I might cut them bcs they wouldnt let me go near those areas with a scissor. So I came to my aunts place this morning, tried to greet her and she ignored me. 

Then my cousin said ""Aunt is mad you cut the mattings off bcs now they look weird."" 

👀. Okay. Can't she tell me herself? LMAO. When I came in her house today she just closed the door to her room when she heard me. 😅. 

Maybe if she combed and brushed them everyday, she wouldnt have so many mattings she said she ""would deal with"". Like come on, she has time to get in her car and attend events till the late evening. 🙄.  

Thoughts?😭. Thank you.


EDIT : Thank you all for your opinions🥺. I decided to cut off the big mattings on the legs of one of her dogs because it didnt walk much or do much aside lie down, little fella was in pain and I felt bad. I was scared at first because the color of the hair and the dogs skin was almost the same but I use tiny scissors and she's moving around more now. But her nails are curling inward and some even have a full circle😅. I sent my auny a message and she just said not to do it again because ""the dogs look weird because the cut was uneven"" and only her or (cousins name) can groom them. And I just said okay💀.

110,1f5ad00,AITA for renting the same wedding venue as my SIL ,"Back story: I've been with my bf (M38) for 7yrs, he proposed this passed spring. I (F31) have not been stressed or felt rushed during the organizational process at all, the only thing I knew was I wanted June'25.
I spoke back in April/May with a few venues here in the city we live in as well as where we vacation pretty much each summer as both his family and my family always have, though we didn't know each other before getting together, we've gone to this beach together ever since and it's become a very special place for us as a couple. Summer comes around and I plan a few visits to different venues though there's obviously one I really like more than the others. I decide to keep these visits a ""secret"" to suprise my fiance with the idea of getting married at the beach once we're there.

Drama: We've been at the beach for a week now, one afternoon in walks my SISTER IN LAW who usually never spends more than 2-3 days at this beach town because it's not boujee enough for her. She walks in with her boyfriend of a total of 12 months, before even introducing him to the family she announces they're getting married. EITHER IN MAY'25 OR SEPTEMBER'25. AT THE BEACH. AT THE VENUE I HAD MY EYE ON. I know this seems ridiculous and probably will turn petty, but her brother (they have a great relationship, or so I thought) proposed to me literally 3 months ago, I don't even have anything set yet, she hasn't even bothered to ask how it was going or what I had in mind, idk, she kind of just plopped the news onto the whole family, all at once. Idk if this is weird or not but we would have expected to be told first or privately and not at a huge beach house with a bunch of aunts uncles and cousins that don't even know the guy yet. Idk if felt a bit invasive.

My response: I didn't say anything other than ""oh.... I have an appointment to see that venue in a few days, it was a supposed to be surprise for your brother"". She ignores me and goes on showing off this extravagant ring, ya-dee-daw, whatever. Oh, apparently that night at dinner my other SIL pulled her aside and told her to not even dare get married one month before our set date... just out of respect. Kudos to her.

Anyway, my fiance and I go see all the beach venues, obviously, the one we like the most is THE ONE WE LIKE THE MOST. They have availability the date I want. Everything's amazing. The next day, I tell my MIL that we went and saw that place. No comments on her behalf but OH SO COINCIDENTLY, my fiance recieves a msg on their group chat that his sister has just reserved the venue for Sept (atleast it wasn't may).

So now I find myself in a predicament. AITA if I rent out the same venue, that I really liked in the first place, for June, even though she beat me to it after only being engaged for five effing days? Or am I making a big deal out of nothing at all?
